Though now rarely performed, it was one of the first ever melodramas (that is, a play consisting of pantomime gestures and the spoken word, both with a musical accompaniment). It is formed of spoken monodrama with instrumental musical interludes and thus can be credited with spreading a new theatrical genre, especially in German-speaking areas of Europe. He wrote it in 1762, with music by Horace Coignet. It was first performed at the H√¥tel de Ville, Lyon in 1770. The work is considered a turning point for its author, who also wrote The Social Contract that same year. History Rousseau probably wrote his text in 1762, but hesitated to put on a production of it, complaining of his lack of skill (in Pygmalion's case in life-giving, in Rousseau's in music-writing). The merchant and amateur composer Horace Coignet allowed him to realise it by writing a score and an overture, and the complete work was put on by amateurs in the town hall in Lyon in private rooms. As with his one-act opera Le devin du village (1752), Rousseau modelled the production on the Parisian 'Th√©√¢tre de la foire'. Without Rousseau's consent, affirmed by the uniqueness of the premiere and the truth of the statue's first interpreter, the play remained in the repertory of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise for about five years in his own 1775 version. Motivation During the creation of the sculpture without divine help, music plays a crucial role, just as Rousseau had planned. The inclusion of music seems to have been more important than the type of music included, since the composition of the musical numbers was not nearly as ambitious as in his ballet-opera Les muses galantes (1745). This shows a change of intention in the use of music - the music no longer complains of its inevitable fading away, but is instead a sign of the statue coming to life, as a cipher for the imagination of the viewer. Analysis The tale of the sculptor Pygmalion, who unhappily falls in love with one of his own sculptures until the goddess Venus takes pity on him and brings the sculpture to life, stems from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The myth remained taboo during the Middle Ages, when any talk of idolatry was forbidden, but from the Renaissance onwards it was adapted in various forms. During the Baroque it provided the plot for several ballets. All the adaptations and ballets showed the futility and hopelessness of Pygmalion's efforts to give the sculpture life and his problem as being solved by divine grace, making Pygmalion an important symbol of vanitas. Rousseau's version seems to be the first where Pygmalion brings his perfect image to life without divine help - 'Galath√©e' (Galatea) comes to life at the last stroke of his chisel, beginning to speak and recognising her creator as her mirror image. She touches herself and says \\"me\\", then touches another sculpture and says \\"not me\\", and finally Pygmalion and says \\"Me again\\". This dialogue with her mirror image is genuine dialogue, reversing the vanitas motif. Importantly, Pygmalion is shown as swearing eternal fidelity to his sculpture, rather than as a collector of sculptures or women. In Jean-Philippe Rameau's opera Pigmalion (1748), from which Rousseau worked hard to differ, the main character is always fixated on the image of the unfaithful lover, drawing on a long tradition of portraying Pygmalion as a misogynist. In the opera, the statue is not brought to life by the artist but by Cupid's help. 1762 also saw the composition of the libretto for Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice, premiered later that year, in which Orpheus gives his dead wife Eurydice life through song, instead of losing faith in the gods. Unlike Pygmalion, the opera still insists on divine intervention to give life, again via Eros, who intervenes to rescue her and bring her back to life after Orpheus turns around and condemns her back to death. Even so, Orfeo and Pygmalion both demonstrate the 1760s theme of an apparent failure by overturning an artist's success, which arose again around the time of Beethoven and then held sway until the First World War (it can also be seen in Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra).

It was founded as a coterie of young talented writers in the Kutaisi city in 1915 and was suppressed under the Soviet rule early in the 1930s. The group originated in Kutaisi, western Georgia (then part of Imperial Russia), then a centre of Georgian avant-garde thought. Its members were the group‚Äôs founder and mentor Grigol Robakidze, Titsian Tabidze, Paolo Iashvili, Valerian Gaprindashvili, Kolau Nadiradze, Shalva Apkhaidze, Nikolo Mitsishvili, Razhden Gvetadze, Levan Meunargia, Ali Arsenishvili, Sandro Tsirekidze, Giorgi Leonidze, Sergo Kldiashvili and Shalva Karmeli (Gogiashvili). Georgia‚Äôs greatest 20th-century poet, Galaktion Tabidze was also affiliated with this group, but he soon left it. The leading Georgian painter of that time Lado Gudiashvili was also closely associated with the group and frequently illustrated their publications. Lado Gudiashvili has painted walls of Cafe Kimerion along with other famous painters. Cafe Kimerion was place for meetings after members of Blue Horns moved to Tbilisi in 1918. The Blue Horns movement was a reaction against Realism and civic modes in Georgian literature. Its d√©but took place under the fashionable banners of Symbolism and Decadence in 1916 when the literary magazine tsisperi qantsebi (\\"·É™·Éò·É°·É§·Éî·É†·Éò ·Éß·Éê·Éú·É¨·Éî·Éë·Éò\\"; The Blue Horns) was first published. The group quickly gained acclaim through their successful efforts to renovate and Westernize Georgian verse. In spite of the Blue Horns‚Äô notorious attacks on the classics of Georgian literature in the group‚Äôs early years, their poetry remained nationalist, yet French-oriented. Their radical experimentation thrived in the years of Georgia's independence between 1918 and 1921. Although the leading \\"Blue Horns\\" made half-hearted conformist gestures, the group came under a strong pressure and criticism after the establishment of Soviet regime in Georgia in 1921. They left the Union of Georgian Writers in October 1921 to form an alternative union, but the group was finally dissolved in 1931-2. Many of them reconciled with the Soviet authorities and were praised for having \\"liberated themselves from decadence\\" and for their \\"significant role in the evolution of Georgian Soviet literature\\". Yet, the fate of the leading \\"Blue Horns\\" was tragic: Shalva Karmeli died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in 1923 and his grave at the Kutaisi Archangel Church was soon razed by the Bolsheviks; Titsian Tabidze and Nikolo Mitsishvili were executed and Paolo Iashvili shot himself during the Great Purge in 1937; Sergo Kldiashvili and Kolau Nadiradze were saved only by chance: their NKVD interrogator was himself arrested and the files mislaid; Grigol Robakidze had earlier defected to Germany escaping the inevitable arrest; the purge of his friends and an obligatory conformism plunged Galaktion into depression and alcoholism, leading to his suicide in 1959. The only member of the Blue Horns movement who has survived the Great Purge was Giorgi Leonidze.  References  *Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History.

It is frequently a pest in aquariums, where it is commonly referred to as hair algae. Introduction Bryopsis/Àåb…πa…™Àà…ëps…™s/ is a genus of macroscopic, siphonous marine green algae that is made up of units of single tubular filaments. Species in this genus can form dense tufts up to 40 cm in height (Fong et al., 2019; Giovagnetti et al., 2018). Each cell is made of up an erect thallus that is often branched into pinnules (Green, 1960). Approximately 60 species have been identified in this genus since its initial discovery in 1809 (J. V. . Lamouroux, 1809). The life history patterns of Bryopsis are highly variable, potentially the most diverse among any genus of green algae (Morabito, Gargiulo, & Genovese, 2010). Bryopsis is widely distributed along tropical and subtropical coastal regions and thrives in eutrophic waters (Krellwitz, Kowallik, & Manos, 2001). Bryopsis can be epilithic or free-floating. Climate warming and pollution are factors that are thought to contribute to its increased presence over the past few years (Song, Wang, Li, Han, & Zhang, 2019). The ecological success of Bryopsis has also been attributed to its associations with endophytic bacteria that reside in the cytoplasm of their cells (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, Willems, & De Clerck, 2013). Species in this genus are known to be pests in aquariums and associated with green tides due to macroalgal blooms (Han, Li, Wei, Wang, & Zhang, 2020; Song et al., 2019). However, Bryopsis also contains unique chemical properties, most notably, Kahalalide F (KF), a depsipeptide that is being studied for its antitumor properties in human cancer cells and also has important ecological significance in protecting the algae against herbivory. The removal of algal blooms for the extraction of KF may be a pragmatic approach to eradicating Bryopsis from green tides and aiding the economic burden of producing KF experimentally for clinical trials. Etymology The word Bryopsis comes from Greek origins. Bry- comes from the Greek words bryos and byron, meaning moss, blossom and bloom. √ìpsis or Ypsis is the Greek word for appearance or sight (M. Lamouroux, 1809). -opsis is synonymous to ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù and used in naming living organisms with organic structures that resemble other pre-existing structures that have already been named. History of knowledge Jean Vincent Felix Lamouroux was the first person to differentiate green, red and brown algae. In 1809, he discovered five new marine algal genera and he cited his findings in the Journal de Botanique. Among them were the first five species in the genus Bryopsis (B. pennata, B. hypnoides, B. arbuscula, B. cupressina and B. muscosa) (J. V. . Lamouroux, 1809). He described this genus as being green, with feather-like fronds (M. Lamouroux, 1809). Lamouroux differentiated these species by their size, arrangement and densities of pinnules on the main axes of the thallus (Krellwitz et al., 2001). In 1823, Bory de Saint Vincent brought forth the family of green algae Bryopsidaceae which included the genus Bryopsis, (Bryopsidales, Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyta) (Woolcott, Kn√∂ller, & King, 2000). Later, 4 other genera (Bryopsidella, Derbesia, Pedobesia and Trichosolen) were also placed in this family. Since Lamouroux‚Äôs initial discovery, there have been over 60 Bryopsis species described worldwide (Krellwitz et al., 2001). The discovery of the variety of life history patterns has been formative in understanding the relationship between Bryopsis and other genera in the order. The life history varies between species of Bryopsis and even within single species of this genus. The differentiation of new genera, such as Bryopsidella, which was previously reported as Bryposis halymeniae and Derbesia neglecta, resulted from the identification of its unique life history. This resulted in taxonomic reorganization at the family level (Morabito et al., 2010). Continuous morphological variations and their inherently simple thallus structure has made it difficult to differentiate species within this genus (Krellwitz et al., 2001). Therefore, the use of molecular datasets is an important tool in differentiating species. Currently, research using the chloroplast genome of Bryopsis as an identifier for species level studies is being done. The entire chloroplast genome of B. plumosa, B. maxima and B. hypnoides has been sequenced (Krellwitz et al., 2001; L√º et al., 2011). Habitat and ecology Bryopsis contains mostly epilithic but sometimes free-floating algae that occupy a range of habitats including seaweed beds, shallow fringing reefs and both sheltered and well-exposed subtidal areas (Giovagnetti et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019). Bryopsis is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas and dominant in eutrophic coastal regions (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, Willems, et al., 2013). B. pennata, B. hyponoides and B. plumosa are among the most common cosmopolitan species within this genus (Krellwitz et al., 2001). In addition to having a wide distribution, this genus can have a high species density. For example, in Singapore it represents one of the four functional-form groups that makes up approximately 20-40% of benthic cover across coral reefs (Fong et al., 2019) and along the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean, where clusters of species from this genus dominate intertidal regions (Krellwitz et al., 2001). Food webs For benthic organisms like Bryopsis, herbivory is an important factor influencing species density and mortality. Chemically mediated predator-prey interactions such as the production of kahalalide F (KF), helps protect Bryopsis from herbivory. However, Sacoglossans are an exception, they are a type of opisthobranch mollusk that eat siphonaceous green algae (Becerro, Goetz, Paul, & Scheuer, 2001). They are highly specialized herbivores that sequester chloroplasts and other secondary metabolites from their diet has a source of photosynthetic energy (Becerro et al., 2001). The literature has demonstrated that both Bryopsis and the mollusks that feed on it are protected from fish predation due to the presence of KF. The sequestration of secondary metabolites such as KF provides the mollusks a diet-derived chemical defense against predation. Therefore, Bryopsis has an influential role on the ecology and evolution of mollusk species that feed on it. Coral reefs Globally, coral reef ecosystems are degrading due to anthropogenic effects such as pollution and climate change (Haas, Smith, Thompson, & Deheyn, 2014). The proliferation of Bryopsis has also influenced the dramatic decline in coral reefs by limiting survivorship and potentially constrain recovery of degrading reefs (Fong et al., 2019). The larvae of coral are vulnerable to competition with macroalgae. Bryopsis reduces survivorship of coral larvae through allelopathic effects, occupying large amounts of geographical space, and destabilizing coral microbiomes. Increasing concentrations of allelochemicals produced by Bryopsis results in increased larval mortality rates. These effects extend beyond the duration of chemical exposure because even when no traces remained, the mortality rate of coral larvae continued to increase in experimental conditions (Fong et al., 2019). Hypoxia may be another factor that contributes to the competitive interactions between coral and macroalgae. Bryopsis is tolerant to low oxygen concentration environments that were detrimental to coral species (Haas et al., 2014). Additionally, the coral skeleton that remains after tissue degradation optimizes colonization by microalgae, which attach to the exposed hard substrate (Haas et al., 2014). Therefore, the recovery of degrading coral reefs containing macroalgae may be negatively affected due to Bryopsis‚Äô wider range of tolerance for suboptimal conditions and its allelopathic effects on the survivorship and settlement of coral larvae. Green tides Algal blooms occur in various coastal regions worldwide. Bryopsis is one of the main genera of macroalgae contributing to this. Microbes break down the macroalgae that accumulate in the ocean and intertidal regions. The decomposition of algae causes oxygen shortages and hypoxic or anoxic, lethal environments for other organisms (Song et al., 2019). This could have serious effects on the ecosystem. Rising sea water temperatures and eutrophication are thought to be major factors responsible for the development of green tides. Bryopsis micro- propagules in the form of gametes, spores and zygotes attach to existing mature thalli or seaweed beds and this initiates the green tides. Algal blooms could have significant ecological repercussions if they are not contained due to their potentially harmful effects on other organisms. Bacterial associations Bacterial associations with marine macro algae are common. They are often found on the surface and in the cytoplasm or vacuoles of the cells and can influence the life cycle as well as different metabolic functions such as growth factors, and the fixation of nitrogen and antimicrobial compounds of the macroalgae (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, Willems, et al., 2013). Bacteria-like particles have been identified in the cytoplasm of the thalli and gametes of Bryopsis. The latter supports the theory of vertical transmission of endophytic bacteria, implying a stable and mutualistic relationship between the host and its endobionts (Hollants, Leroux, et al., 2011). Bryopsis is thought to have intrinsic mechanisms that are highly selective for specific bacteria despite being exposed to a wide range of marine bacteria (Hollants, Decleyre, Leliaert, De Clerck, & Willems, 2011). The functionality of the presence of these endosymbionts is not well known however, they are thought to provide the algae an adaptive advantage (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, De Clerck, & Willems, 2013). A strong host specific association between Flavobacteriaceae endosymbionts and Bryopsis has been cited in literature to aid nitrogen fixation in the algae (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, De Clerck, et al., 2013). Generalist phylotypes fulfill metabolic functions such as nitrogen-fixation (Rhizobiaceae), anoxygenic photosynthesis (Phyllobacteriaceae) and CO-oxidation (Labrenzia) (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, Willems, et al., 2013). Morphology Bryopsis is a filamentous green alga that can forms dense tufts between 2 ‚Äì 40 cm tall (Fong et al., 2019; Guiry, G, 2011). Organisms are single tubular cells that are siphonous, which is a term used to describe algae in which the thallus is not compartmentalized and typically contains a large vacuole surrounded by an outer later of protoplasm. The nuclei and chloroplasts reside in the thallus and line the cell wall. When extruded, the protoplasm can survive without a cell membrane for several minutes before regenerating into mature individual units (Hollants, Decleyre, et al., 2011; L√º et al., 2011). The thallus is commonly erect and occurs in two morphologies corresponding to haploid or diploid life cycle stages: the macrothallus and microthallus (Hollants, Leliaert, Verbruggen, Willems, et al., 2013). The growth of the macrothallus is indeterminate, while the microthallus is often determinate (Guiry, G, 2011). The fronds of Bryopsis vary among species from deltoid to lanceolate and the pinnules are most commonly in radial, distichous or secund arrangements (Krellwitz et al., 2001). Previous research on the morphology of this genus has correlated the wall structure with the cell shape of Bryopsis. The cell walls are tough yet flexible (Giovagnetti et al., 2018). The main components of the cell wall are mannan, cellulose and xylan (Br√ºck & Schnetter, 1997; Huizing & Rietema, 1975). Its meristematic activity is conveniently differentiated from the typical mechanism in that it is free of cross-walls, is not covered by mature laterals and its laterals all lie in the same plane, so new mass is added to the inner surface of the growing walls from transverse microfibrils (Green, 1960). The apical development and arrangement of transverse microfibrils play an important role in the lateral and longitudinal growth of the cell wall structure (Green, 1960). Chloroplasts and light-harvesting modulation The chloroplast is the largest organelle in the cell of Bryopsis (L√º et al., 2011). Its relative vitality compared to other organelles in unfavourable conditions and its ability to photosynthesize and lodge in other cells demonstrates its high level of autonomy relative to other organelles (L√º et al., 2011). The chloroplast is also thought to have an important role in protoplast regeneration. The literature suggests that the fast rate of repair to photosystem II and transient photoinactivation are mechanisms that this genus uses to help mitigate photodamage from excess sun light (Giovagnetti et al., 2018). The siphonous morphology of Bryopsis also plays an important role in adapting to changing light conditions on the intertidal shores; affecting light-harvesting modulation in some species of this genus (Giovagnetti et al., 2018). Some species of Bryopsis have a protective state in which their bodies discriminate between surface filaments that get high exposure to the sun from those that reside in underlayers. Nucleus Bryopsis is a unicellular coenocytic cell (L√º et al., 2011). In the macrothallus, nuclei are approximately 25 ¬µm in diameter, while in the microthallus the primary nucleus can be up to 60 ¬µm (Br√ºck & Schnetter, 1997; Minamikawa, Yamagishi, Hishinuma, & Ogawa, 2005). The nucleolus of the primary nucleus is spherical and around 20 ¬µm in diameter. In many species of this genus, it has been observed that nuclear volume is not related to nuclear DNA content (Br√ºck & Schnetter, 1997). In the sporophyte stage, the nucleus is 10 ¬µm diameter. Once the nucleus of the sporophyte reaches a sufficient size, it will start to divide, resulting in a multinucleated sporophyte. This arrangement is aided by centrioles which help to separate the chromosomes and split the nucleus into two daughter nuclei. After the first division, the nucleus of the sporophyte is the same size the nuclei in the mature macrothallus (Br√ºck & Schnetter, 1997). The subsequent division of the cytoplasm results in uninucleate masses of protoplasm. Life cycle Bryopsis have highly variable life history patterns, even within species. The life cycle of Bryopsis has two stages alternating between an erect macroscopic stage which form macrothalli and a small branched phase which form microthalli (Br√ºck & Schnetter, 1997). Macrothalli are haploid while microthalli are diploid (Morabito et al., 2010). Haploid macrothalli may either produce gametes that will then fuse to make a zygote and then a sporophyte (microthallus), or they may produce microthalli at the tips of fronds whose cytoplasms are always kept separate from that of the ‚Äúmother‚Äù organism, the macrothallus. In this specialized region, diploid and haploid nuclei can both be found, but the exact mechanism of diploidization is poorly understood (Br√ºck and Schnetter 1997). This means that in Bryopsis diploidization to produce microthalli is not dependent on syngamy, it can happen within the macrothallus. This can be disadvantageous due to the loss of genetic exchange, but it is advantageous because the direct development of microthalli does not depend on mating so new microthalli can be produced relatively quickly. Microthalli formed in this way then detach from the gametophyte to form separate sporophytes. Macrothalli develop either directly from microthalli, or through stephanokontic zoospores which form from them (Minamikawa et al., 2005). Stephanokontic zoospores are flagellated cells that develop into gametophytes upon attachment to substrate (Minamikawa et al., 2005). Stephanokontic zoospores in the life cycles of Bryopsis have been observed in many species. However, some species within Bryopsis do not have stephanokonic zoospores and produce macrothalli directly from microthalli. Both methods of development can occur within one species, as observed in B. plumosa (Minamikawa et al., 2005). The timing of meiosis in Bryopsis is not well understood. Aquarium pests Species of Bryopsis commonly populate commercial aquariums. They are introduced to aquariums on life rocks and the nutrient rich environment is favourable for its growth (Manoa, 2001). With little competition or predation in these environments, Bryopsis can overtake the benthic surface creating unfavorable low-oxygen environments for other species (Manoa, 2001). The elimination and control of Bryopsis within aquariums is challenging to manage and has economic significance. Clinical applications for chemical properties of Bryopsis  Bryopsis is a source of bioactive compounds such as therapeutic kahalalides (Hollants, Leroux, et al., 2011). Kahalalide F (KF) acts against human cancer cell lines (Becerro et al., 2001; Wang, Waters, Valeriote, & Hamann, 2015). Clinical trials have demonstrated that when KF is combined with its other isomers it is highly sensitive to drug resistant strains of cancer (Su√°rez et al., 2003). The potential for clinical application is being explored, though the mechanism by which KF targets cancer cells is not well understood. Potentially invasive green algae that grow as a result of algal blooms could be recovered to extract KF for clinical purposes (Su√°rez et al., 2003). This is thought to be a pragmatic approach to addressing the ecological impact of green macroalgae blooms and the economic burden associated with manufacturing KF for clinical trials.

Open from 1 June 1847 to 2 May 1977, it was sited just north of the River Stour in what is still Station Road. Built for the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, the station was operated from the start by the London and South Western Railway, which took over ownership in 1848. It was then operated by the Southern Railway (1923‚Äì47) and from 1948 by the Southern Region of British Railways which traded as British Rail from 1965. Heyday From the mid-1860s until the mid-1880s, the station was a significant station in its own right on the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and the point of interchange for other lines. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran from Wimborne Junction, just south of the station on the other side of river, initially to Blandford (1860) and then Burnham in Somerset (1863) and finally Bath (1874); Wimborne was the point of reversal for trains to and from Poole. The second route was the Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway (1866), a minor line which branched off at West Moors; the station there was not opened until 1867, and goods traffic largely continued to be worked through to Wimborne and later beyond. The final new railway, branching off the original main line at New Poole Junction, was to Poole (1872) and onwards to Bournemouth (1874). Decline Bournemouth's rapid development in the late Victorian era as a residential town and holiday resort indirectly led to the decline of Wimborne station. The Somerset and Dorset avoided the awkward reversal there by opening a bypass from Corfe Mullen to Broadstone in 1885 (goods) and 1886 (passengers). A handful of local S&D; passenger trains still ran into Wimborne, as well as some goods trains as the large yard made for a more convenient point of interchange. Worse still came in 1888 when Wimborne was bypassed by the opening of a direct line to Bournemouth from the east. When that was extended in 1893 across Poole Harbour to join with the original Southampton and Dorchester line at Hamworthy Junction via the Holes Bay Curve - forming an alternative through-route between Southampton and Weymouth via Bournemouth - this meant that most main line passenger trains to and from London, Dorchester and Weymouth had no need to run through Wimborne. Nevertheless, the generally increasing level of traffic on the railways up to 1914 meant that it was still a busy station, although post-war economies led to the withdrawal of the last S&D; passenger trains from 11 July 1920, followed by milk and parcels in February 1932, with freight traffic ceasing completely from 17 June 1933. Loss of the S&D; traffic only left Wimborne with the infrequent pull-push services between Brockenhurst and Bournemouth West, a handful of trains from Salisbury and some long-distance Summer Saturday traffic when the station was used to relieve Bournemouth. This seasonal holiday traffic built up in the inter-war period and boomed in the 1950s. Goods trains also used the route all year around for the same reason. Closure In its final years the station suffered from an air of neglect, although photographic evidence suggests that the main buildings were kept in a decent state of repair into the early 1960s. Wimborne station closed to passengers as from 4 May 1964 along with all others on the bypassed original line, an early casualty of the Beeching Axe programme of economies. Regular goods services ceased from 28 February 1966 when sundries were concentrated on Bournemouth Central. This led to a rationalisation of the station's track and signalling for the purposes of dealing with the remaining goods traffic, and from 24 July 1966 \\"siding working\\" was introduced whereby the Down line was put out of use and services were concentrated on the former Up line. Signals were removed, but the signalbox remained in service as a ground frame until 8 January 1967 when all points were converted for manual operation. Goods and parcels trains continued to serve the station from Poole, running through to West Moors and Ringwood until August 1967. Thereafter traffic to Wimborne consisted mostly of coal and similar wagon loads, with the continued use of the line for an RAOC fuel depot just beyond West Moors keeping trains running through until the summer of 1974. The track north of Wimborne was lifted from October 1974, back to a point immediately south of Leigh Arch, the dangerously narrow and low bridge over what was then still the busy A31 road. This allowed the bridge to be demolished. For just over another 30 months, the occasional goods train disturbed the peace of Wimborne's decaying station, although by then the main reason for the line's survival was the use of the goods yard by a company building exhibition trains. The site today The site is now partly occupied by the weekly Wimborne Market while industrial and commercial units cover most of the rest. Much of the original embankment was removed in the mid 1980s, although it is not clear where the spoil was taken. Some oral accounts say it was used for construction of the Wimborne bypass (A31) while others suggest reclamation work in Poole Harbour near the town's railway station.

He was born to parents Dantzick Batt and Sarah Lindsel. He had a younger brother, Dantzick, baptized January 23, 1729. Isaac was baptized January 7, 1731 in Widford, Hertfordshire, England. He was a fur trader mostly with the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company and the first record of him dates to 1754. At that time he had a contract to serve as a labourer at York Factory (Man.). Batt quickly proved to be useful in the \\"Inland trade\\"' aspect of the company business and was influential amongst the Indians near present day The Pas, Manitoba. Batt married a Cree chief's daughter in 1756 and had one daughter Margaret Nistichio Batt. Nistichio, Cree for three-persons-in-one, was born in 1757 in what was then Rupertsland. She was raised to be at home in both native and Scottish cultures. In 1758 he was west of Cumberland Lake, in 1763 near The Pas and in a later year on the upper Assiniboine River. In 1771/72 he was with Louis Primeau. In August 1773 he and James Batt left York Factory, Manitoba but had to turn back because of low water. In 1776, he hired his services to Joseph Frobisher, one of the \\"Pedlars\\" who carried on trade competitive to the HBC. He did, however, return to company services the next year and finished his life in the inland trade. In 1791 he left Manchester House to go hunting with some Indians he did not know. They robbed and murdered him. He was one of the few HBC men killed by Indians. Batt epitomizes the type of service rendered by many of the early inland employees of the Company. Although illiterate, and therefore unsuited to keeping proper records and making written reports, he won the trust of the natives and married into their society. He left descendants in the country where he died. \\"Isaac's House\\", a temporary post somewhere downstream from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan was named after him.

Set in Turin at the end of the 19th century, it stars Marcello Mastroianni as a labor activist who becomes involved with a group of textile factory workers who go on strike. The film had its premiere at the 35th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. The script was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 37th Academy Awards. Plot The film is set in Turin at the end of the 19th century and opens with a scene showing workers of all ages, including young teenager Omero (Franco Ciolli), rising at 5:30 in the morning before heading to a textile factory where they work until 8:30 in the evening. Towards the end of the day, fatigue starts taking its toll and disaster strikes when the hand of a drowsy worker is mangled by a machine. Workers Pautasso (Folco Lulli), Martinetti (Bernard Blier), and Cesarina (Elvira Tonelli) decide to form an ad hoc committee and speak to management and state their case that the 14-hour work day needs to be shortened by one hour to avoid accidents arising from exhaustion. Their request is ignored and they only receive admonishments to be more careful. Moreover, a subsequent attempt by the workers to emphasize their grievances by staging a walkout an hour early on the next evening results in a humiliating defeat when they lose their nerve and stay until the usual time. Professor Sinigaglia (Marcello Mastroianni), a labor activist on the run from the police in Genoa, hops off a freight train and comes to hide in the neighborhood. There, he runs into a meeting where the undeterred workers discuss the idea of all coming to work an hour late to make their point. The bookish-looking, unassuming Sinigaglia becomes involved, and in a burst of fiery rhetoric persuades the workers to escalate their struggle by not coming to work at all and going on strike instead. Drawing on his own experience, he also helps them to prepare effectively by building up a stock of supplies. The workers committee expresses its gratitude by assigning Sinigaglia as a guest to Raoul, a bitter worker who is skeptical about the others' determination as well as the movement's chances of success, and is displeased with this arrangement. After a failed attempt at inducing the strikers to resume work by granting token concessions without shortening work days, management proceeds to bring in workers freshly laid off by another factory to take over. A confrontation ensues between the strikers and the replacement workers, resulting in Pautasso's death. This tragedy draws the attention of the press and the government, forcing the factory owners to send the replacement workers back home. However, the police also manage to track down Sinigaglia to Raoul's home, sending the professor on the move again after a narrow escape. As the duration of the strike reaches a month, the factory owners are suffering severe financial losses and are close to giving in. Unaware of this and suffering from both low supplies and a low morale, workers meet and vote to end the strike. Sinigaglia then reappears, delivers yet more fiery rhetoric and convinces them not only to keep striking but to escalate the movement by occupying the factory. In a showdown between the strikers and an army unit dispatched to block access to the premises, soldiers fire into the crowd, killing Omero and sending the others fleeing. Sinigaglia is arrested by the police, and Raoul has to go into hiding after attacking a police officer. The film's end mirrors its beginning: the grim-faced employees are shown crossing the factory gates to resume work, with Omero now replaced by his younger brother (whom Omero had hoped would obtain a better education and escape the fate of factory workers). Meanwhile, Raoul hops on a freight train to find shelter with a member of the underground labor movement in another city, and is now determined to pursue the struggle. Cast * Marcello Mastroianni - Professor Sinigaglia * Renato Salvatori - Raoul * Gabriella Giorgelli - Adele * Folco Lulli - Pautasso * Bernard Blier - MartinettiThe film features several well-known French actors: Bernard Blier, Franois Prier and Annie Girardot. * Raffaella Carr√† - Bianca * Fran√ßois P√©rier - Maestro Di Meo * Vittorio Sanipoli - Baudet * Franco Ciolli - Omero * Mario Pisu - Manager * Kenneth Kove - Luigi * Annie Girardot - Niobe * Edda Ferronao - Maria * Anna Di Silvio - Gesummina * Roberto Diamanti * Elvira Tonelli - Cesarina Background Italy‚Äôs first capital after the Risorgimento ended in the 1870s, Turin was in the midst of rapid industrialization during the period of The Organizer, although the film unfolds some years before the growth of the industry. Populating his densely inhabited film with actual workers, Monicelli was attempting, three years before The Battle of Algiers (1966), to create a sort of neorealist period piece; using a strategy that would subsequently be seen in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Organizer opens with a montage of historical photographs that skillfully segues into contemporary facsimiles. Style Inspired, according to its director, by the revolutionary ghosts of Paris‚Äôs no longer extant Bastille and set in the slums of late-nineteenth-century Turin, the film accepts what the influential Italian Marxist leader Antonio Gramsci saw as ‚Äúthe challenge of modernity,‚Äù namely, ‚Äúto live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned.‚Äù To that end, The Organizer is variously (and, for some, disconcertingly) jaunty, sentimental, comic, and baffling, as Monicelli applies the tonal shifts associated with the French New Wave to a straightforward saga of working-class solidarity. Others attribute those tonal shifts to Age & Scarpelli, who \\"were among the leading screenwriters\\" of the commedia all'italiana. In an interview, Monicelli said \\"the subject is serious or tragic, but our point of view is comic and humorous. This is a type of comedy that grows out of the fact that Italians see reality and life precisely in this matter.\\" Notable for its period detail and Giuseppe Rotunno‚Äôs accomplished faux-daguerreotype cinematography, the film is not so much a call to action as to recollection‚Äîboth a historical monument and a taboo-breaking depiction of a specific moment. Throughout, Rotunno‚Äôs black-and-white cinematography makes evocative use of flat lighting and gray skies to accentuate the sense of soot and smoke. (Because little was left of nineteenth-century Turin, the movie was actually shot in the nearby Piedmontese cities of Cuneo, Fossano, and Savigliano, with the vast factory interior filmed in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.) Reception In May 1964 Walter Reade-Sterling released a 126-minute version of the film; according to Bosley Crowther, that version is a \\"simple social drama [that] turns out to be engrossingly human, compassionate and humorous....Marcello Mastroianni ... plays the title role with a delightful blend of ardor, ingenuousness and whimsicality. He excels as the shaggy-haired, near-sighted, idealistic intellectual who leads a handful of downtrodden workers ... in a revolt. But the whole thing is done with such veracity and the other roles are so strongly played or, at least, so graphically represented--that one feels right in the middle of one of those classic demonstrations in which the labor movement was born.\\" In 1964 the National Board of Review placed the film on its \\"Year's Five Best Foreign Films\\". It was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 37th Academy Awards. Notes References  External links   *The Organizer: Description of a Struggle an essay by J.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award (Short Subjects, Live Action Subjects), and won a Silver Bear (Short Film) at the Berlin International Film Festival. Plot A young man sets to work restoring a vintage car at the home of his aunt. The little girl who lives next door is intent on sabotaging his project at any cost, but when he wins her over with a smile, she ends up helping him to build it. He completes the project and wins the hand of the girl‚Äôs older sister, who has been dating a rude, mannerless spiv who tears around in a sports car. Locations The film was shot largely in and around Farnborough, Hampshire, and Cove, Hampshire. The car was rebuilt at Blackwell Cottage, Cambridge Road West, Farnborough. The house remains, although the garage has been replaced by a detached house, now number 26. The house where the little girl lived, next- door, is also still there. As well as Farnborough, parts of the filming took place in Bucks Horn Oak, Hampshire and Seale, Surrey. Cult success The film became a cult success when regularly broadcast as a trade test colour transmission on the run up to the start of BBC2 colour transmissions.Keys, Andrew (2007). \\"The Statistician's Guide to Trade Test Colour Films\\", webpage of the \\"Test Card Circle\\" website archived at WebCite from this original URL 2008-06-18. Originally screened from September 1968 until August 1973, it was one of a series of short films broadcast to help television engineers set up new colour television sets. Other popular offerings were The North Sea Quest, Overhaul, Crown of Glass, Roads to Roam, The Small Propeller, The Cattle Carters, Prospect for Plastics, A Journey into the Weald of Kent, Giuseppina and Evoluon. The Home Made Car has been made available by the BFI as an extra on either DVD or Blu-ray discs along with two more short films from the sixties also directed by James Hill called Giuseppina and Skyhook and included with the main movie called 'Lunch Hour'. The car The owner of the Bullnose Morris in the film, Eric Longworth, kept the car until his death in 2011. The car is now owned by Stuart Cooke of Darwen Lancashire. When the film was shot, the car had already been fully restored, so the chassis of another car which Eric was restoring at the time, a rare 1916 Perry, was used to replicate the Morris during restoration. The featured sports car, registration VWK 929, is a white late '50s Austin-Healey 100-6 with red interior. BP production Production of the film was sponsored by the British Petroleum company (BP), and the Bucks Horn Oak scenes were based at a petrol filling station.

He was one of the founders and principals of the American film and television production company Levy-Gardner-Laven. Laven was a producer of, among other things, the western television series The Rifleman and The Big Valley. He also directed motion pictures, including Without Warning!, The Rack, The Monster That Challenged the World, Geronimo, Rough Night in Jericho, and Sam Whiskey. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Laven directed dozens of episodes of television series, including episodes of Mannix, The A-Team, Hill Street Blues, The Six Million Dollar Man, Fantasy Island, The Rockford Files and CHiPs. Early years Laven was born in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in the late 1930s. He got his start in the entertainment business working as a mail room messenger at Warner Bros. First Motion Picture Unit During World War II, Laven was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit, the first unit of the United States military to be made up entirely of motion picture personnel. The unit made training films from 1942‚Äì1945 at the old Hal Roach motion picture lot. Laven later recalled that the films they made were not \\"phony\\" Hollywood war films: \\"They had to be approved by the higher-ups in the Air Force. They had to be technically accurate in every possible way.\\" The unit included actors George Montgomery, Arthur Kennedy, Alan Ladd, William Holden, and DeForest Kelley. Army Capt. Ronald Reagan was the unit's personnel officer. Laven recalled that the men liked and respected Reagan, noting, \\"He was always a very warm, cordial, and pleasant man.\\" Laven described the First Motion Picture Unit as \\"the best film school in the world,\\" because participants learned all aspects of the movie industry. He even had the opportunity to work briefly in front of the camera as an extra in the pilot training short, Live and Learn. Post-war years After the war, Laven continued to work in the motion picture business, holding jobs as a script supervisor, dialogue director, and film press agent. He worked on such films as William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives and Fred Zinnemann's Teresa. 1950s In September 1951, Laven formed a production company with Jules V. Levy and Arthur Gardner, both of whom he had met while working in the First Motion Picture Unit. The company, which eventually became Levy-Gardner-Laven, was initially called \\"Allart Pictures, Inc.\\" The company opened offices at Goldwyn studios and announced plans to begin casting on their first feature, Without Warning!, a thriller about a psychopathic killer on the loose. Laven directed, and Adam Williams was cast as a gardener who murdered women with his garden shears. Operating on a shoe-string budget, the film was shot on the streets of Los Angeles‚Äîon the Hollywood Freeway, in Chavez Ravine, at the Produce Terminal, and plant nurseries, cocktail bars, and taxi offices. On seeing the end product, the Los Angeles Times reported that Laven and his partners had \\"succeeded in parlaying a $15,000 investment into a film production that is likely to gross well over $1,000,000, so decisive is its merit.\\" In May 1952, Hedda Hopper announced the arrival of the new team as follows: The trio's second feature was Vice Squad, a 1953 detective drama directed by Laven and starring Edward G. Robinson and Adam Williams. The third feature, Down Three Dark Streets, was another semidocumentary-style film noir starring Broderick Crawford as an FBI agent. The film's climax took place around the Hollywood Sign. A newspaper review of the 1954 film noted the promise of the three young producers: In 1956, Laven went out on his own to direct The Rack, a drama starring Paul Newman and Lee Marvin about a soldier who is court-martialed for collaborating with the enemy after spending two years in a North Korean prison camp. The film was based on a United States Steel Hour program written by Rod Serling. In 1957, Levy-Gardner-Laven team turned their focus to the popular science fiction and monster genres. Laven received directing and producing credits on The Monster That Challenged the World, a feature about an army of giant mollusks that emerge from the Salton Sea in California's Imperial Valley. A review in the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"distinctly chilling,\\" noted that \\"Laven never lets the tension slacken,\\" and described the plot as follows: The trio followed with a pair of vampire movies, The Vampire, a 1957 release about a small town doctor who mistakenly ingests an experimental drug made from the blood of vampire bats, and The Return of Dracula, a 1958 feature about a vampire who murders a Czech artist, assumes his identity, and moves to the United States. In the late 1950s, Laven also directed Slaughter on Tenth Avenue (1957), a crime drama set on the docks starring Richard Egan and Walter Matthau, and Anna Lucasta (1958), a feature starring an all-African American cast that included Eartha Kitt and Sammy Davis, Jr. The Rifleman and other westerns In 1957, Laven and his partners were collaborating with young screenwriter, Sam Peckinpah, on an episode of Zane Grey Theater when Laven came up with the concept for The Rifleman. Looking for a hook to separate the idea from other westerns, Laven suggested that they focus on the relationship between the rifle-toting settler and his son. Laven recalled that he was \\"inspired by his own relationship with his son, Larry, and told writer Sam Peckinpah to develop a father-son relationship.\\" The Rifleman, with former professional baseball and basketball player Chuck Connors in the lead role, proved to be Laven's biggest success. The series ran from 1958 through 1963 and became one of the most successful television series of the 1960s. With the success of The Rifleman, the Levy- Gardner-Laven team devoted much of their efforts in the 1960s to the western genre. During the 1959‚Äì1960 television season, they produced Law of the Plainsman, a western television series starring Michael Ansara as an Apache Indian who attends Harvard University and then returns west as a Deputy Marshal in New Mexico. Laven developed a friendship with Rifleman star Chuck Connors. In 1962, Laven cast Connors in the title role of the biographical film, Geronimo, which Laven directed and produced. After The Rifleman left the air, Laven returned to the western genre as the executive producer of the long-running western television series, The Big Valley. The series starred Barbara Stanwyck and was broadcast by ABC from 1965 to 1969. Laven was responsible for casting Lee Majors as Stanwyck's son, predicting big things for the young actor: \\"It's his first appearance before a camera and I'll go on record as saying he's one of the most attractive male stars to come along in years.\\" Laven's association with the genre extended into a string of feature films. His directing credits in the western genre included The Glory Guys, a 1965 feature written by Sam Peckinpah about George Armstrong Custer and his 7th Cavalry Regiment, and Rough Night in Jericho, a 1967 western film starring Dean Martin, George Peppard, and Jean Simmons. In 1968, Laven became one of the first directors to be confronted with cutting a scene under the newly introduced MPAA ratings system. The film was Sam Whiskey, a western directed by Laven and starring Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson as characters trying to recover $250,000 in gold bars from a steamboat wreck. The film as submitted by Laven to the MPAA included \\"a bare-from-the-waist-up shot\\" of Angie Dickinson. When faced with the prospect of an \\"R\\" rating (at the time an entirely new concept), Laven substituted a tighter shot of Dickinson from the shoulders up to avoid the \\"R\\" rating. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Levy-Gardner-Laven team also remained active as producers on such films as Clambake, a 1967 Elvis Presley musical co-starring Shelley Fabares, The Scalphunters, a 1968 western directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis and Telly Savalas, and Kansas City Bomber, a 1972 drama starring Raquel Welch as a roller derby athlete. Laven was presented one of the Golden Boot Awards in 1992 for his contributions to western cinema. Television directing Laven was also active for more than 30 years as a director of episodic television. His television directing credits included episodes of such series as The Rifleman (21 episodes), Mannix (8 episodes), The Greatest American Hero (7 episodes), The A-Team (6 episodes), The Big Valley (6 episodes), The Secrets of Isis (6 episodes), Eight Is Enough (5 episodes), Hill Street Blues (3 episodes), The Six Million Dollar Man (3 episodes), Planet of the Apes (3 episodes), Fantasy Island (2 episodes), The Rockford Files (2 episodes), Police Woman (2 episodes), Ironside (2 episodes), and CHiPs (2 episodes). Death On September 13, 2009, Laven died from complications of pneumonia at the Tarzana Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. He was survived by his wife, the former Wallace Earl Sparks, a daughter and a son. Laven and his wife had been married since 1951.

Their recording of the Ola Belle Reed song \\"High On a Mountain\\" is featured in episode eight of the 2007 Roadtrip Nation series on PBS. The group performs approximately 75 dates a year, traveling as far as Hawaii, and has been featured at major festivals such as Wakarusa, the Chicago Country Music Fest, and the Folk and Roots Fest. Recordings In 2004, the group recorded their first full-length CD, \\"Just a Spoonful (and other Folksongs of Rural Cook County)\\", with noted engineer Bob Weston. The record was made as a modern field recording in an empty Chicago two flat, capturing the band live to two-track analog tape, using vintage recording equipment. In stark contrast to most modern recordings, the CD was made without edits or overdubs. The album's tunes drew from old-time country (Train 45, Katy Kline), Blues (Spoonful), Bluegrass (Orange Blossom Special), and Jazz (Duke Ellington's C Jam Blues).The record received rave reviews from the music press in publications such as Sing Out!, Bluegrass Unlimited, and the Chicago Reader. Chicago Reader music critic Monica Kendrick also drew attention to the CD's humorous liner notes, written by Jazz critic Alexander Gelfand and mandolinist Kenneth Rainey. Tangleweed's second full-length CD, \\"Where You Been So Long?\\", was recorded at King Size Sound Labs in Chicago, with engineer Mike Hagler (Billy Bragg, Wilco). The group expanded their source material to include traditional Irish ballads and tunes (the Leaving of Liverpool, the Musical Priest, and Whiskey Before Breakfast), folk ragtime (Draggin' the Bow), and western swing (I Found a New Baby). The CD was similarly well-received, garnering airplay in twenty countries and twice appearing on the Folk Music Airplay chart. The band's song \\"Wrap Yourself Around Me\\" was a semifinalist in the 2005 International Songwriting competition. Tangleweed recorded an interpretation of the popular sea shanty \\"South Australia\\" for the \\"Old Town School of Folk Music Songbook Series, volume 2\\", on Chicago-based Bloodshot Records. The recording is actually a medley of two tunes, as the band inserted the traditional fiddle tune Fisher's Hornpipe between verses. The Songbook Series sessions were engineered by John Abbey in a mobile recording facility at the school. Their third CD, \\"Most Folk Heroes Started Out As Criminals,\\" was released in October, 2008. Their fourth CD, \\"Please Punch Richard for Me\\" was released in July, 2011.

The West Bear Creek watershed is a tiny contributing area of the Neuse River basin. The geology of the area is mostly siliclastic sediments and organic soils. Deep groundwater is fed to the creek by the Black Creek aquifer. Land use in the area is mostly agriculture, although the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the city of Goldsboro, and the town of La Grange are located with 10 to 15 miles of the creek. Because of the surrounding land use, West Bear Creek experiences large nitrate fluxes, resulting in poor water quality. The site has been the focus of numerous research investigations on the fate and transport of nitrogen in groundwater. Further work will shed light on more details of this creek's hydrology and the role agriculture plays in impaired water quality of streams. References Kennedy, C.D., L.C. Murdoch, D.P. Genereux, D.R.

His family, along with those of √Üthelstan Half-King and √Üthelstan Rota, rose to greatness in the middle third of the 10th century. In the reign of Edward the Martyr, √Ülfhere was a leader of the anti-monastic reaction and an ally of Edward's stepmother Queen Dowager √Ülfthryth. After the killing of Edward by √Ülfthryth's servants in 978, √Ülfhere supported the new king, √Ülfthryth's son √Üthelred the Unready, and was the leading nobleman in the Kingdom of England until his death in 983. Origins and relations √Ülfhere was a son of Ealhhelm (fl. 940-951) who had been one of the several ealdormen in Mercia in the reigns of Kings Edmund and Eadred. The family was of Wessex origin, like most of those prominent in Mercia in the period, and may have been connected to the royal family, probably members of a collateral branch of the Royal house.Henson, p. 127; Higham, p. 4. Charters variously call √Ülfhere and √Ülfheah propinquus, that is consanguineal relative, of Kings Eadred, Eadwig, and Edgar, and of the chronicler Ealdorman √Üthelweard. Ealhhelm was a major figure who witnessed a large number of charters; Stafford, p. 38. See Williams, p. 144, table 1, for the known and conjectured relationships. The family's power-base was probably in south-west Mercia, in the diocese of Worcester, the former Kingdom of the Hwicce. √Ülfhere's brother √Ülfheah (fl. 959-972) was an important figure, serving as steward to King Eadwig from 956 and as ealdorman of Hampshire from 959. One of √Ülfhere's brothers may have been married to a niece of Saint Dunstan.For √Ülfhere's kin, which included at least two other brothers, see Williams, passim, especially p. 144, table 1. √Ülfhere was promoted by King Eadwig, probably as a counter to the influence of √Üthelstan Half-King and his kinsmen.Higham, pp. 4-5. Eadwig's promotion of new men, such as √Ülfhere, soon faced opposition from the old guard. The crisis came in 957, and to all appearances was settled by negotiation. The English kingdom was neatly partitioned between Eadwig and his younger brother Edgar, Eadwig ruling south of the Thames, Edgar to the north. √Ülfhere survived the crisis, abandoning Eadwig, and became Edgar's devoted supporter.Higham, p. 5; Stafford, pp. 47-50. Prince of the Mercian people Following the partition of the kingdom, √Üthelstan Half-King retired from political life, leaving √Ülfhere as the chief ealdorman in Edgar's northern kingdom. From 959 to 975 he was almost always the first witness to Edgar's charters.Maddicott, p. 7 The Life of Oswald of Worcester written by Abbot Byrhtferth of Ramsey refers to √Ülfhere by the impressive title --prince of the Mercian people, last used in the days of √Üthelfl√¶d and √Ülfwynn--and as a witness to Oswald's charters he is called \\"ealdorman of the Mercians.\\"Williams, p. 157. His brother √Ülfheah disappears from the record circa 972, and it may be that √Ülfhere then became ealdorman of Hampshire or central Wessex.Henson, p. 125, however Higham, p. 5, presumes that the appointment remained vacant. As the ealdorman of Mercia, √Ülfhere was concerned with relations with the Welsh princes. Wars in Wales gave opportunities for fame, and for booty to be distributed to allies and kinsmen. A campaign in 983 by √Ülfhere against Brycheiniog and Morgannwg, with the aid of the Welsh king Hywel ap Ieuaf, is recorded by the Annales Cambriae.Stafford, p. 120. Edward and √Üthelred King Edgar's complicated marital relations left two sons on his death in 975. Edward, the elder, was the son of √Üthelfl√¶d, daughter of Ordm√¶r, the younger was √Üthelred, son of √Ülfthryth, daughter of Ordgar. A late source describes √Ülfhere as a friend of √Ülfthryth, to whom √Ülfheah had left lands in his will.Williams, pp. 150 & 157. As Edward was about fifteen years of age, and √Üthelred only six or seven, the disputes from 975 to 978 were not between two rival kings, but between two factions among the notables of the kingdom. Edward was supported by the church --he was crowned by Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Oswald of Worcester, by then Archbishop of York--and by √Üthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, heir of √Üthelstan Half-King. √Ülfhere, on the other hand, was counted among the supporters of √Üthelred.For the events of 975 to 978, see Higham, pp. 6-14; Stafford, pp. 57-59; Stenton, pp. 372-374. The short reign of Edward was the period of the so-called anti-monastic reaction. √Ülfhere was portrayed by medieval writers, who were typically monks, as a leader in this movement, which saw the seizure of monastic lands by the magnates. In √Ülfhere's case, this appears to have centred on the lands attached to monasteries founded by Oswald of Worcester, which had been greatly enlarged with the assistance of the sons of √Üthelstan Half-King.Higham, pp. 8-9; Lapidge; Stafford, p.58; Stenton, pp. 372-373. The reign of Edward came to an end with his murder at Corfe Castle on 18 March 978. His stepmother Queen √Ülfthryth was soon blamed for the killing, the details of which are uncertain. Edward was initially buried at Wareham, but in 979 or 980 √Ülfhere and Archbishop Dunstan had the remains of the king reburied at Shaftesbury Abbey. Whether √Ülfhere wished to publicly disassociate himself from the killing of Edward, or to assuage a guilty conscience--he certainly profited from Edward's death--can only be conjectured.Higham, pp. 12-14; Stafford, pp. 58-69\\\\. Stafford notes the possibility that the reburial of Edward was an attempt by the supporters of √Üthelred to effect a reconciliation with the supporters of Edward. The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle for the year 983 records √Ülfhere's death. He was buried at Glastonbury Abbey. √Ülfric Cild, his sister's husband--she may have been called √Üthelfl√¶d--succeeded to some of his offices, but was exiled in 985. No children of √Ülfhere are known, but two of his nephews appear in the record. √Ülfric Cild's son √Ülfwine was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991 and √Ülfheah's son Godwine may be the same person as Godwine, ealdorman of Lindsey, who died in the Battle of Ashingdon in 1016.Williams, p. 144, table 1 & pp. 170-171.

Although sometimes described as a gunfighter, he did not historically fit into that category. Originally from Illinois, Lowe and his wife Katherine, aka \\"Rowdy Kate\\", moved to Kansas following the Civil War. In 1871, the couple moved to Newton, Kansas where they set up a saloon and brothel. In 1872, Kate snuck off with a gunman to visit a competing brothel. Joe found out and shot the man. The controversy forced the pair to relocate to the Wichita area where they bought another saloon in Delano, Kansas. This business venture that at first was extremely profitable. On October 27, 1873, Lowe shot and killed fellow saloon owner Edward \\"Red\\" Beard after Beard stormed into his saloon shooting at one of Lowe's \\"girls\\". Beard hit another girl with one shot, and a patron with another before Lowe shot him. However, after numerous complaints of cheating and under-handed card deals, Lowe's business began to suffer. The couple moved to Texas, where they rode, on occasion, with the Sam Bass gang. The couple began drifting, gambling and occasionally working in saloons in numerous towns of the Old West. On February 11, 1899, Lowe was drunk in the Walrus Saloon in Denver, Colorado. He began insulting a man named E.A. Kimmel due to his disapproval of Kimmel being a policeman. Kimmel, knowing Lowe had a reputation as a gunman, drew his pistol shooting and killing Lowe, who turned out to be unarmed. The Wichita City Eagle tells the story of Rowdy Joe Lowes death being in October 1874. The newspaper reported that Rowdy Joe was attacked by Indians en route to the Black Hills. He was shot by three bullets and instantly died.  Further reading  Joseph G. Rosa, and Waldo E. Koop. Rowdy Joe Lowe: Gambler with a Gun. University of Oklahoma Press (1989). .

It is found in the eastern and central sections of the Amazon basin south of the Amazon River, only just extending onto the northern bank of this river. Description Total length c. . As other members of the Pyrrhura picta complex, it is a long-tailed mainly green parakeet with a dark red belly, rump and tail-tip (tail all dark red from below), a whitish or dull buff patch on the auriculars and bluish remiges. The cheeks and ocular region are dark maroon. The nominate subspecies (P. a. amazonum) has a narrow blue forehead-band and pale grey scaling to the chest. The remaining subspecies, P. a. snethlageae and P. a. lucida, have little or no blue to the forecrown and their chests are, uniquely for the P. picta complex, overall pale with relatively narrow, dark pointed markings. P. a. lucida is slightly smaller and paler than P. a. snethlageae. Some P. a. snethlageae have a yellowish eye-ring (the basis for this variation remains unknown), but it is more commonly dark grey as in the remaining subspecies. All subspecies have dark greyish legs. Habitat and behavior It is restricted to Brazil and Bolivia. It occurs in tropical humid lowland forest and adjacent habitats. It is social and typically seen in pairs or groups. It feeds on fruits, seeds and flowers. The nest is placed in a tree cavity. It is fairly common in most of its range and occurs in several protected areas, e.g. P. a. amazonum occurs in the Amaz√¥nia National Park, Par√°, Brazil, while P. a. lucida occurs in the Cristalino State Park, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Taxonomy It has typically been considered a subspecies of the painted parakeet. While reviewing this group, Joseph (2002) discovered that an undescribed population existed in central Brazil (later also found in north-eastern Bolivia). It was described as Pyrrhura snethlageae (Joseph and Bates, 2002). No diagnostic difference was found between the taxa amazonum and microtera; it was therefore recommend that the latter should be considered a junior synonym of the former. As with most other taxa of the Pyrrhura picta complex, it was recommended that amazonum should be recognized as a monotypic species, P. amazonum, instead of a subspecies of P. picta. Ribas et al. (2006) confirmed by mtDNA that P. amazonum should be considered a species separate from P. picta (otherwise, P. picta would be paraphyletic), but also showed that snethlageae was very close to, and arguably better considered a subspecies of, P. amazonum (as already had been expected due to a number of intermediate specimens suggesting that hybrids occur). Consequently, SACC voted to recognize P. amazonum as a species with snethlageae as a subspecies. Arndt (2008) recently described yet another taxon from this complex, lucida, as a subspecies of P. snethlageae, but under the here used taxonomy, it becomes a subspecies of P. amazonum. The taxonomic status in relations to Deville's parakeet remains unclear. References Further reading * Arndt, T. (2008).

Biography While at Lehigh University at the beginning of the 20th century, he concluded that the traditional classroom was insufficient for technical students.Smollins, J.P. The Making of the History: Ninety Years of Northeastern Co-op. Northeastern University Magazine. Boston, MA: Northeastern University (Office of University Relations). May, 1999. Downloaded July 12, 2005, from http://www.numag.neu.edu/9905/history.html . Schneider observed that several of the more successful Lehigh graduates had worked to earn money before graduation. Gathering data through interviews of employers and graduates, he devised the framework for cooperative education (1901). About that time, Carnegie Technical School, now Carnegie Mellon University, opened and thereby minimized the need for Schneider's co-op plan in the region around Lehigh University. However, in 1903 the University of Cincinnati appointed Schneider to their faculty, and later, in 1906, allowed him an experimental year to implement his plan. Following that year, the University of Cincinnati gave him full permission for the co-op program. His idea was that industry had the best equipment, and that it was very expensive for the University of Cincinnati to purchase equipment that would quickly become outdated. Further, there was the expense of maintaining the building. He surmised that it would take four or more years for a student trained in engineering to become familiar with an employer's needs. Then there was industrial, mechanical and civil engineering. Schneider, beginning from the rank of assistant professor, rose through the rank of dean of engineering (1906-1928) to become president (1929‚Äì32) of the University of Cincinnati, based largely upon the strength of the co-op program. Throughout his career, he was an advocate for the co-op framework. His thirty years of service to the University of Cincinnati are partly credited for that institution's worldwide fame. Cincinnati's example was soon followed by Northeastern University using co-op in their engineering program, in 1922 extending it to the College of Business Administration and other new colleges. By 1919, Antioch College had adapted the co-op practices to their liberal arts curricula, for which reason many called co-op the \\"Antioch Plan\\". In 1926, Dean Schneider invited those interested in forming an Association of Co-operative Colleges (ACC) to the University of Cincinnati for the first convention. The idea took hold, and was followed by three more annual conventions. In 1929, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, now called American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), formed the Division of Cooperative Engineering Education, incorporating the membership of the ACC.Auld, R. B. The Cooperative Education Movement: Association of Cooperative Colleges. Journal of Cooperative Education (ISSN 0022-0132), vol. 8, pp. 24‚Äì27, 1972. Also in 1926 the General Motors Institute (GMI) was opened following this model to train new General Motors hires. This school was later renamed Kettering University. In 1965, The Cooperative Education and Internship Association (CEIA) created \\"The Dean Herman Schneider Award\\" in honor of the contributions made by Dean Schneider in cooperative education. The award is given annually to an outstanding educator from faculty or administration. Schneider was unable to get those at the University of Pittsburgh to accept his ideas, for he was only an assistant professor. He wrote an article about cooperative engineering, which Charles William Dabney, who was recently appointed University President read. Concurrently Schneider came to Dabney, and wanted to earn a masters or a PhD in order that people would listen to him. Dabney had come from Tennessee, and he had a similar idea that wanted to propose in the Ag School. He was impressed with Schneider's depth of thinking and told him that he did not need additional degrees, he simply needed to be Dean. Thus, he asked Schneider to be patient, for there would soon be a position open. Shortly, the original dean resigned, and Schneider was appointed in his place. The value was that the engineering school, which had entered into cooperative arrangements with what was to become Milicron, and several other tool and die shops, would hire these men, teach them to use the equipment and then try to design better equipment. For their work they were paid, but the school now could teach twice as many students‚Äîgiving them the mathematics, drawing, physics, etc., that they would need, and then they would go out and work x months and implement their ideas. The industries liked this because they got engineers upon graduation who could start immediately in solving their problems. Further, they knew that these men would probably keep working on the problem that they had uncovered while they were working at their shops, for which they didn't have to pay‚Äîthe latter was not advertised, but could be predicted if one picked people who had an engineering mind. Cincinnati had a large number of men trained in Germany, who also were able to design or improve machines. Cincinnati was in the business of making the machine that would make the machine. Schneider worked hard at his deanship, but Frederick Charles Hicks succeeded Dabney when he left in 1920. A number of similar efforts in fields that would benefit from practical combined with academic work‚Äînow called internships‚Äîwere presented to Schneider. When Hicks left, there was considerable angst. Hicks had been dean of Commerce (Business) and they understood each other's goals. After some persuasion, Schneider became the interim President of the University, reluctantly, be he set to doing the same kind of forward thinking that he had done with Engineering. Times were harder, and the University did not pay very much. Several men looked at the job but saw it as a municipal university, not very highly ranked, and left. Therefore, Schneider finally took the job and was president of the University for several years. He died on March 28, 1939, in Cincinnati, Ohio, at 67 years old. References The story of Schneider's ascendancy to the Deanship comes from the unpublished autobiography of Charles William Dabney, which is available for reading in the Archies and Rare Books Library at Blegen Hall. The story of the politics and travails of higher order academic politics is contained in the typed minutes of the Board of Directors of the University.

Like MC-CDMA, CI-OFDM spreads each data symbol in the frequency domain. That is, each data symbol is carried over multiple OFDM subcarriers. But unlike MC-CDMA, which uses binary- phase Hadamard codes (code values of 0 or 180 degrees) or binary pseudonoise, CI codes are complex-valued orthogonal codes. In the simplest case, CI code values are coefficients of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Each row or column of the DFT matrix provides an orthogonal CI spreading code which spreads a data symbol. Spreading is achieved by multiplying a vector of data symbols by the DFT matrix to produce a vector of coded data symbols, then each coded data symbol is mapped to an OFDM subcarrier via an input bin of an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). A block of contiguous subcarriers may be selected, or to achieve better frequency diversity, non-contiguous subcarriers distributed over a wide frequency band can be used. A guard interval, such as a cyclic prefix (CP), is added to the baseband CI-OFDM signal before the signal is processed by a radio front-end to convert it to an RF signal, which is then transmitted by an antenna. A significant advantage of CI-OFDM over other OFDM techniques is that CI spreading shapes the time-domain characteristics of the transmitted waveform. Thus, CI-OFDM signals have a much lower peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), or crest factor, compared to other types of OFDM. This greatly improves power efficiency and reduces the cost of power amplifiers used in the radio transmitter. A CI-OFDM receiver removes the cyclic prefix from a received CI-OFDM transmission and performs OFDM demodulation with a DFT (e.g., an FFT) typically used in OFDM receivers. The CI-spread symbol values are collected from their respective subcarriers in an inverse-mapping process and may be equalized to compensate for multipath fading or processed for spatial demultiplexing. The CI de-spreader performs an inverse-DFT on the spread symbols to recover the original data symbols. CI- OFDM Transmitter and Receiver Since CI coding can shape the time-domain characteristics of the transmitted waveform, it can be used to synthesize various waveforms, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum and frequency shift key [4] signals. The advantage is that the receiver can select time-domain or frequency-domain equalization based on how much scattering occurs in the transmission channel. For rich scattering environments, frequency-domain equalization using FFTs requires less computation than conventional time- domain equalization and performs substantially better.  History of CI  CI was introduced by Steve Shattil, a scientist at Idris Communications, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,992,US 5955992, \\"Frequency-shifted feedback cavity used as a phased array antenna controller and carrier interference multiple access spread-spectrum transmitter\\" filed February 12, 1998, and in the first of many papers in April, 1999. The concept was inspired by optical mode-locking in which frequency-domain synthesis using a resonant cavity produces desired time-domain features in the transmitted optical signal. In radio systems, users share the same subcarriers, but use different orthogonal CI codes to achieve Carrier Interference Multiple Access (CIMA) via spectral interferometry mechanisms. Many applications of CI principles were published in dozens of subsequent patent filings, conference papers, and journal articles. CI in frequency-hopped OFDM is described in the international patent application WO 9941871.WO9941871, \\"Multiple Access System and Method\\" CI in optical fiber communications and MIMO is described in US 7076168.US 7076168, \\"Method and apparatus for using multicarrier interferometry to enhance optical fiber communications\\" US 6331837US 6331837, \\"Spatial interferometry multiplexing in wireless communications\\" describes spatial demultiplexing using multicarrier signals that eliminates the need for multiple receiver antennas. CI coding of reference signals is disclosed in US 7430257.US 7430257, \\"Multicarrier sub-layer for direct sequence channel and multiple- access coding\\" The use of CI for linear network coding and onion coding is disclosed in US 20080095121US 20080095121, \\"Carrier interferometry networks\\" in which random linear codes based on the natural multipath channel are used to encode transmitted signals routed by nodes in a multi-hop peer-to-peer network. The similarity between antenna array processing and CI processing was recognized since the earliest work in CI. When CI is combined with phased arrays, the continuous phase change between subcarriers causes the array‚Äôs beam pattern to scan in space, which achieves transmit diversity and represents an early form of cyclic delay diversity. Combinations of CI coding with MIMO precoding have been studied, and the idea of using CI in MIMO pre- coded distributed antenna systems with central coordination was first disclosed in a provisional patent application in 2001.US Pat. Appl. 60286850, ‚ÄúMethod and apparatus for using Carrier Interferometry to process multi- carrier signals‚Äù CI-based software-defined radio (SDR) that implemented four different protocol stacks was developed at Idris in 2000 and described in US 7418043.US 7418043, \\"Software adaptable high performance multicarrier transmission protocol\\" Mathematical description In spread-OFDM, spreading is performed across orthogonal subcarriers to produce a transmit signal expressed by x = F‚àí1Sb where F‚àí1 is an inverse DFT, S is a spread-OFDM code matrix, and b is a data symbol vector. The inverse DFT typically employs an over-sampling factor, so its dimension is KxN (where K > N is the number of time-domain samples per OFDM symbol block), whereas the dimension of the spread-OFDM code matrix is NxN. At the receiver, the received spread-OFDM signal is expressed by r = HF‚àí1Sb, where H represents a channel matrix. Since the use of a cyclic prefix in OFDM changes the Toeplitz-like channel matrix into a circulant matrix, the received signal is represented by r = F‚àí1ŒõHFF‚àí1Sb = F‚àí1ŒõHSb where the relationship H = F‚àí1ŒõHF is from the definition of a circulant matrix, and ŒõH is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements correspond to the first column of the circulant channel matrix H. The receiver employs a DFT (as is typical in OFDM) to produce y = ŒõHSb. In the trivial case, S = I, where I is the identity matrix, gives regular OFDM without spreading. The received signal can also be expressed as: r = F‚àí1ŒõHFF‚àí1(ŒõCF)b, where S = ŒõCF, and C is a circulant matrix defined by C = F‚àí1ŒõCF, where ŒõC is the circulant‚Äôs diagonal matrix. Thus, the received signal, r, can be written as r = F‚àí1ŒõHŒõCFb = F‚àí1ŒõCŒõHFb, and the signal y after the receiver's DFT is y = ŒõCŒõHFb The spreading matrix S can include a pre-equalization diagonal matrix (e.g., ŒõC = ŒõH‚àí1 in the case of zero-forcing), or equalization can be performed at the receiver between the DFT (OFDM demodulator) and the inverse- DFT (CI de-spreader). In the simplest case of CI-OFDM, the spreading matrix is S = F (i.e., ŒõC = I, so the CI spreading matrix is just the NxN DFT matrix). Since OFDM‚Äôs over-sampled DFT is KxN, with K>N, the basic CI spreading matrix performs like a sinc pulse-shaping filter which maps each data symbol to a cyclically shifted and orthogonally positioned pulse formed from a superposition of OFDM subcarriers. Other versions of CI can produce alternative pulse shapes by selecting different diagonal matrices ŒõC.

Each film in the series featured a different actress portraying Della Street. The characters were revived in the popular CBS television series Perry Mason which starred Raymond Burr as Perry Mason and Barbara Hale as Della Street. That series ran from 1957 to 1966. Monte Markham revived the character in a 1973-74 The New Perry Mason CBS television series that co-starred Sharon Acker as Della Street.

He wants to leave his money to the apparent wife of Clinton Foley, another millionaire and the dog's owner, explaining that while \\"Evelyn Foley\\" pretends to be Foley's wife, he is still legally married to someone else. Perry explains how Cartwright should word his odd bequest and after receiving a huge retainer fee, gives him a form to fill out and return. When Perry receives the form the next day, Cartwright has changed the beneficiary to Foley's actual wife. The fee paid by Cartwright obligates Perry to legally and morally represent the real Mrs. Foley to the best of his ability. Foley attempts to file a complaint of insanity against Cartwright, claiming he is a homicidal maniac whose bizarre behavior prompted most of Foley's household staff to quit. A sheriff's deputy is assigned to investigate the complaint. He and Perry accompany Foley back to his house, where Perry questions why an addition to his garage is being built for yet another car if his chauffeur has quit. Attractive Lucy Benton, who Foley states is his housekeeper, rushes from the house with her right hand heavily bandaged to tell Foley that she was bitten by the dog while giving it an emetic, thinking it had been poisoned. When they ask to talk to Foley's \\"wife\\" Evelyn, Lucy tells them that she has just packed her bags and disappeared. A note left behind states that she loves Cartwright and is going away with him. Perry goes next door and finds that Cartwright has also disappeared overnight. A telegram sent from Ventura and signed by Evelyn is sent to Foley asking him to stop his actions. Perry's private detectives investigate and learn that Evelyn was actually Cartwright's wife who ran away with Foley when they were friends in Santa Barbara with Foley and his wife Bessie. Lucy was Foley's private secretary then, unbeknownst to Evelyn. One of Perry's men is assigned to watch Foley's house and sees Lucy drive away with an unknown man. A cab arrives with a woman in black. When Foley shows annoyance that she \\"found him\\", she tells him that she \\"wants justice\\" and he releases the dog to attack her. Two shots are fired, killing the dog and Foley, followed by the slamming of the garden door, and the woman flees. Perry arrives for a meeting with Foley and discovers the bodies. He immediately tracks down the cab driver at his cab stand, learning that a perfumed handkerchief left in the cab links \\"Bessie\\" to the murder scene, and then finds the woman, who is the actual wife and his client, in a hotel under an assumed name. He sends his secretary, Della Street, to impersonate Bessie and claim the handkerchief before the cabbie turns it in. Bessie denies killing her husband. Perry warns her that she is going to be arrested for Foley's murder and orders her to say nothing to the police. Later, acting on a hunch when none of the handwriting samples of the three women gathered by his operatives matches the note and the handwritten copy of the telegram, Perry devises a ruse to obtain a page from Lucy's diary of the day after the Cartwrights disappeared. During the trial, Perry discredits the cab driver's identification of his passenger when he demonstrates that he misidentified Della as Bessie. During his cross-examination of Lucy, Perry has the trial shifted to the scene of the crime, shows that the dog was devoted to all three women, and proves that Lucy was Foley's lover and is ambidextrous, writing the note, the telegram, and the diary page with her left hand. Just then, workers excavating the foundation of the garage addition discover the bodies of Cartwright and Evelyn, murdered by Foley. Bessie is acquitted after Perry in closing arguments states that because the dog loved her, he would never have attacked Bessie and been killed, destroying the prosecution's only other link of Bessie to the crime. After the trial, Perry presents Bessie with a dog that looks just like the dead animal, and the dog delightedly greets Bessie. Perry states that when the howling suddenly stopped, he searched kennels in the area and found one where a man matching Foley's description exchanged the dog for a lookalike. He gives Bessie the dog and orders her not to tell anyone what really happened. Perry later tells Della that he is sure that whatever Bessie did was in self-defense.

Data extracted from the References External links Category:Sphaeropleales genera ","title":"Dictyochloris"},{"id":"13131260","text":"Dictyochloropsis is a genus of unicellular green alga of the phylum Chlorophyta. This genus consists of free-living algae which have a reticulate (net-like) chloroplast that varies slightly in morphology between species, and that when mature always lacks a pyrenoid. Dictyochloropsis is asexual and reproduces using autospores. Previously, many species of the morphologically similar genus Symbiochloris were incorrectly classified to this taxon. These species were recently reclassified on the basis of molecular DNA analyses. Dictyochloropsis is found in terrestrial environments all over the world, but can live and grow in freshwater environments as well. Recently, there has been promising research towards growing Dictyocloropsis in culture for the production of biofuels. Etymology The name of Dictyochloropsis comes from the Greek language. The prefix ‚Äúdictyo‚Äù is derived from the Greek word ‚ÄúŒ¥ŒØŒ∫œÑœÖŒø‚Äù or ‚Äúd√≠ktyo‚Äù meaning ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, which is in reference to the net-like chloroplast present in this genus. The medial ‚Äú-chloro-‚Äù is from ‚ÄúœáŒªœâœÅœåœÇ‚Äù or ‚Äúchloros‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe colour green‚Äù because of the green pigment, chlorophyll, which colours the algae. The suffix ‚Äú-opsis‚Äù comes from ‚Äú·ΩÑœàŒπœÇ‚Äù or ‚Äúopsis‚Äù, roughly translating to ‚Äúappearance,‚Äù ‚Äúsight‚Äù or ‚Äúview‚Äù. Thus, ‚ÄúDictyochloropsis‚Äù when translated from its Greek roots means ‚Äúnetwork of green appearance,‚Äù an accurate description of the green algae characterized by its reticulate green chloroplast.  History of knowledge  Dictyochloropsis was first identified as a genus in 1966 by Lothar Geitler, who defined it as a unicellular green algae with a complex chloroplast that reproduces using autospores. Geitler‚Äôs observations were not complete, he was unsure if he had correctly defined the new genus, and he requested supplementary observations from other scientists to attempt at further defining the taxon. In the early 1980s, Elisabeth Tschermak-Woess used Geitler‚Äôs definition to classify several species of lichenized green algae under the same taxon. However, some of these algae reproduce with zoospores or aplanospores, which does not agree with Geitler‚Äôs observations. In 2014, Francesco Dal Grande used microsatellite markers to discover that Dictyochloropsis as previously defined was polyphyletic, forming two distinct clades. The first clade is composed exclusively of free-living algae which reproduce using autospores. The second clade included lichenized as well as free-living algae that reproduce using zoospores or aplanospores. Organisms in both clades have similar morphologies and life cycles, and this is why they were initially classified in this polyphyletic genus. In 2016, Pavel Skaloud et al. moved the Dictyochloropsis lichenized species to the genus Symbiochloris based on data from phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. As a result Dictyochloropsis was redefined to its current monophyletic meaning.  Habitat and ecology  Dictyochloropsis is an ecologically important algae most commonly found living as an epiphyte or in soil. Although species in the phylum Chlorophyta mainly live in freshwater habitats, Dictyochloropsis is usually found in terrestrial environments. This algae does not feed, it uses photosynthesis to create its energy, and thus it only lives in habitats with access to light. Species have been found and cultured from places all over the world, including the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Austria, Germany, Japan, Pakistan, Ukraine and Indonesia. Habitats which Dictyochloropsis has been cultured from include soil, tree bark, and hard surfaces such as rocks and concrete. Dictyochloropsis is also able to survive and grow in freshwater environments. When isolated, Dictyochloropsis cultures are typically grown in nutrient-rich freshwater environments.  Description   Morphology  Members of Dictyochloropsis are free-living, unicellular green algae. Their cells lack flagella and are globular at all life cycle stages. In this genus, young cells from autospores can be as small as 6 Œºm in diameter, and the largest species grow up to 50 Œºm in diameter before reproducing. The cell is often surrounded by a thick envelope of mucilage when mature. Their chloroplast gives Dictyochloropsis cells their characteristic green colour. Their large, reticulate chloroplast is a key character used to identify this genus. At some ontogenetic stages, the chloroplast forms lobes in a parallel arrangement. When mature, the chloroplast lacks a pyrenoid. Chloroplast morphology can vary between members of Dictyochloropsis at the same life cycle stage, and is often used to identify specific species within this genus. For example, young D. splendida cells have parietal chloroplasts, while young D. asterochlorodies cells have asteroid chloroplasts. Dictyochloropsis cells are uninucleate. Their nucleus is positioned centrally in the cell, and often the chloroplast approaches and surrounds it. As cells grow and produce chlorophyll, the nucleus is often difficult to see through the large chloroplast. Nevertheless, when high portions of the cell lumen fill with clear cytoplasm, the nucleus is revealed.  Life cycle  Dictyochloropsis reproduces asexually exclusively by means of autospores, which largely resemble the parent cell. Different species produce anywhere between 4 and 16 autospores each time they reproduce. Reproduction by autospores is one of the main ways in differentiating Dictyochloropsis from the morphologically similar Symbiochloris taxon. When Dictyochloropsis cells are preparing to reproduce, the nucleus may first divide intracellularly depending on the number of autospores that will be produced. The number of nuclear divisions prior to cell division dictates the number of spores which will be produced, this can vary even between individuals in the same species. Next, autospores are produced inside the mother cell‚Äôs mucilage forming an autosporangium. When the spores are formed, the autosporangium decays by rupturing or dissolving, depending on the species. As Dictyochloropsis cells prepare to divide, several intracellular changes happen to the chloroplast. The chloroplast's lobes widen, becoming denser and lighter in colour at the edges of the cell, and looser and darker at the center. This change indicates that thylakoids are grouping within the lumen. Lastly, the chloroplast‚Äôs lobes fuse into a single, more compact, granular structure surrounding the nucleus and divides into two parts. As the mother cell divides into autospores, several chloroplasts are produced for the resulting cells. During reproduction, the chloroplast briefly becomes unilayered. As the cell then grows, the chloroplast undergoes longitudinal division producing the characteristic layered lobes.  Practical importance  Culturing algae is one of the most promising fields for generating biofuels, due to their rapid growth rate and minimal nutrition requirements. Dictyochloropsis has been considered as a potential candidate to be farmed for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol and biohydrogen. When cultured under optimal conditions (20-30 ¬∞C in BG11 growth medium), Dictyochloropsis produces 21.8% biodiesel per gram of biomass, 175 Œºmol biohydrogen (mg chl a h‚àí1)‚àí1), and 0.236 g L‚àí1 h‚àí1 bioethanol. Interestingly, Dictyochloropsis produces more biohydrogen when incubated without glucose, rather than with it.

History In 2002, Duke Energy acquired Westcoast Energy, a Canadian corporation, which owned Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, regulated under the 1998 Ontario Energy Board Act. On December 29, 2006 Standard & Poor's added Spectra Energy Corp. to its S&P; 500 Index, replacing Parametric Technology Corp. (), a software company, which then moved to the S&P; MidCap 400 list instead. Spectra began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SE. On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business, including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas, to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for every 2 shares of Duke Energy. By early August 2007, the S&P; 500 breached its first 10% correction in over four years, and the shares of Spectra Energy Corp. sunk to their lowest point since trading had begun in December 2006, after the company announced that second quarter earnings had dropped 39 percent.Midday Leaders & Laggards: S&P; 500, forbes.com, Associated Press, 08.06.07 In 2009, the company's financial performance had improved and had a total shareholder return of 38.3 percent. In 2011, Spectra Energy achieved record net income and surpassed its earnings target by more than 7 percent. And, in 2011, the company increased its annual dividend to $1.12, representing a nearly 8 percent increase.  Merger with Enbridge  Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. on September 6, 2016, agreed to buy Spectra Energy in an all-stock deal valued at about $28 billion. Environmental record For 2010, Spectra Energy was listed in the Newsweek green rankings, with a ranking of 280 out of the 500 largest publicly traded corporations in America. The listing was based on environmental impacts, green policies, and a reputation survey. Despite those high rankings, Spectra Energy's environmental record is not without incidents or government imposed penalties. Since 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports twenty-five separate incidents at Spectra's Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline ranging from equipment failure to incorrect operations to pipe corrosion. Combined, those incidents caused $12,036,495 in property damage, and the US federal government fined Spectra a total of $403,100 over that period. The most recent incident for that pipeline occurred on May 31, 2015 when a piece of the pipeline in the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas ruptured. Similarly the US federal government has imposed $154,700 in penalties since 2007 at Spectra's Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline for a single incident from 2010. An incident in 2010 from Spectra's Southeast Supply Header Pipeline did $561,563 in property damage, which led to it being fined a total of $201,300 by the US federal government. Spectra Energy may be considered the single largest private-sector source of greenhouse gases in British Columbia. Since it co-owned DCP Midstream Partners with ConocoPhillips, Spectra Energy was reported in 2005 to emit 19,746 tons of nitrogen oxides and 9,286 tons of volatile organic compounds per year. As of August 2015, Canada's National Energy Board has fined Spectra's subsidiary Westcoast Energy a total of $122,300 for violations.

Montana's Butte-Anaconda Historic District, the next largest, covers 9,774 acres (15.2 square miles). The Adirondack Park, also in New York, and Alaska's Cape Krusenstern are larger, but are not conventional historic districts. It covers an area of 22,205 acres (34.6 square miles, 89 km¬≤) extending inland roughly a mile (1.6 km) from the east bank of the Hudson River between Staatsburg and Germantown in Dutchess and Columbia counties in the U.S. state of New York. This area includes the riverfront sections of the towns of Clermont, Red Hook, Rhinebeck and part of Hyde Park. This strip includes in their entirety the hamlets of Annandale, Barrytown, Rhinecliff and the village of Tivoli. Bard College and two protected areas, Margaret Lewis Norrie State Park and Tivoli Bays Unique Area, are also within the district. From the colonial era to the early 20th century, it was characterized by the large \\"country seats\\" built by members of the Livingston family, such as Clermont Manor and Montgomery Place, both National Historic Landmarks. For most of that period, these estates were worked by tenant farmers, with much of the rest of the population concentrated in the small riverside communities. This semi-feudal arrangement is still reflected in land use and architecture within the district today, since it has not seen major development. In 1990, two separate historic districts were combined and expanded into a National Historic Landmark District (NHLD), in recognition of this unique history and character. Only 2% by acreage of the properties within the district are not considered historic. Geography The Hudson River Historic District roughly corresponds to the 40 estates established along the river on lands originally granted to the Livingston family. Portions, the Sixteen Mile District and Clermont Estates Historic District, were previously included in two other smaller districts that were later incorporated into the district. Two of its boundaries are political. On the west it ends at the Ulster county line in the middle of the river channel. The Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge provides the only access from this direction. In the north it is the line between the towns of Clermont and Germantown. The south boundary is not a municipal line but rather coterminous with the south boundary of Margaret Lewis Norrie State Park north of Staatsburg. Only to the east does the delineation get complicated. It follows an irregular line parallel to US 9 north to Weys Corners, the junction with NY 9G north of Rhinebeck, and then 9G from there to the north boundary. It has been drawn very tightly to exclude some newer properties that do not reflect the traditional character of the area yet include some lands still reflecting their development as estates that had not previously been recognized. There are no signs or other indicators of the district boundary along the local and county roads that serve it. The land within the district is generally a gentle and gradual slope from the low glacial ridge followed by routes 9 and 9G to the river, which generally remains about 10 feet (3 m) above sea level at this point. The railroad tracks built for the Hudson River Railroad to connect New York City and Albany, still used by Amtrak and CSX today, run at the river's edge through much of the district. Most of the land reflects its past as large country estates, with large fields and meadows alternating with woodlots. The slope allows for expansive views from cleared areas of not only the river and the higher glacial ridges on the west side but the Catskill Mountains in the distance. This prospect has attracted homebuilders from the earliest times of settlement to the present, and is considered an essential quality of the district: \\"There is a sense of openness that belies [the district']s constrained width because it is counterpointed by the persistent vision of the mountains in the west,\\" writes architectural historian Neil Larson in the NHL application. \\"The district benefits from such a direct and imposing profile of the mountains, and its legendary country estates would lose much of their appeal without this extraordinary setting.\\" Rhinecliff, the oldest riverside community The district's permanent human population and attendant development is densely concentrated in the small riverside communities ‚Äî from south to north, Rhinecliff, Barrytown, Annandale and Tivoli. This, too, reflects the years of estate and country house development, as well as the historic importance of the river and rail transportation corridor to the local economy. History The history recognized by the NHLD designation began in 1688 with the first colonial land grants and continues to the end of country house development in the area around 1940. It can be divided into several phases: the colonial era when only Clermont Manor stood, the post-Revolutionary period in the early 19th century when more houses were built in newer architectural styles, the later 19th and early 20th century when the area became less desirable by wealthy homebuilders, and the later 20th century when efforts to preserve and protect the properties began. Clermont Manor Colonial era 1779 map of Livingston Manor Robert Livingston the Elder was the first member of the family to obtain the patent on the that would later become identified with his family. His son Robert Livingston Jr. established the first country seat on Livingston Manor in the 1730s when he built Clermont, reserving the entire that fronted on the river for himself. He designed Clermont carefully to be a working farm as well as an estate, to be made financially viable when portions further inland were leased in portions to tenant farmers. The sweeping view of the lands further emphasized the Livingstons' dominance over many of the lands visible. This, as well as Clermont's name and position, strategically overlooking the Hudson and its commercial traffic, was influenced strongly by European feudal practices, setting a pattern other estates in Livingston Manor were to follow long after his lifetime. His son Judge Livingston followed feudal tradition further by marrying Margaret Beekman, daughter of Henry, another large local landowner whose holdings were concentrated around present-day Rhinecliff, which grew up around them. Beekman lived at Kipsbergen, a Dutch-style stone house that burned down in the early 20th century. Its appearance is recalled in the peaked roof of the Rhinebeck post office, built in 1940. Judge Livingston participated in the Stamp Act Congress. His son, Robert helped draft the Declaration of Independence. He and Margaret would have nine children. The eldest, Robert R. Livingston, built another estate, Belvedere, just south of Clermont. In retaliation for the family's revolutionary activities, in October 1777, the British burned both Clermont and Belvedere. Around the time of the Revolution, Margaret Beekman Livingston, had begun parcelling out smaller tracts of her holdings to her children. This led to the construction of another dozen estates during the early years of the new nation. They were joined by her son-in-law, Governor Morgan Lewis, who settled on south of Rhinecliff in 1790 and built a small house there. 19th century At first, some of the younger Livingstons' estates followed the British colonial patterns of Clermont. Rhinebeck House, today known as Grasmere, is the best- preserved example. Later on the houses began to show the influence of contemporary French tastes, abandoning the large central hall in favor of smaller rooms and passageways inside and focusing more attention on the garden side of the house, which usually faced the river and mountains as well. Montgomery Place, built by Janet Livingston Montgomery after the death of her husband Richard, is the only example from this period that remains largely as it was when first built. A direct French presence, in the form of a visiting French friend of Robert Livingston's, was also responsible for creating Tivoli. He laid out streets and a plan for Red Hook Landing, a small boat- building town on the river, and renamed it. His plans were never fully realized, but they did guide the community's development. In 1870 it incorporated as a village, taking in the adjacent commercial center of Madalin. View across the Hudson Valley to Catskills from Livingston lands today The Romanticism that flourished in the succeeding years drew a good deal of its inspiration from the Hudson Valley, in the form of the Hudson River School in painting and the architectural theories of Andrew Jackson Downing, put into practice there and elsewhere by his proteg√©s Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers as well as Richard Upjohn and Alexander Jackson Davis. \\"No part of the United States had a more correct kind of Romantic scenery to offer\\", wrote Catskill historian Alf Evers. > The Livingstons took full advantage of this gift dumped into their laps by a > whim of the gods. They appropriated the Catskills as a feature of their > landscape and as a source of aesthetic pleasure to Livingstons and their > guests ... [F]rom the Livingston country, the entire eastern wall of the > Catskills with its higher peaks rising within the wall may be grasped in one > delighted glance. Many of the then-popular locust trees were planted on the Livingston estates to frame the views. The Livingstons, as was customary for the owners of large country estates at the time, opened their grounds to the public on weekends as parks, and to this end followed Downing's theories of landscaping by building curving paths and rustic benches and shelters from which to admire the river and distant mountains. The Livingstons also spurred the population of the area through the tenants they attracted to work the farms. Many were poor German immigrants, who settled in the area from the 1710s onward because other settlers were wary of the feudal \\"three-life\\" leases the Livingstons had traditionally offered, under which the property reverted to the original landowner if it could not be paid off in the lifetime of the original lessee, his son and grandson after him (It rarely was). Occasionally these led to \\"Anti-rent Wars\\", uprisings that sometimes directly affected the landlords, as in 1832 when Lewis's mansion was burned, supposedly by angry tenants. He replaced it with a 25-room Greek Revival home, the root of the current structure. Those who did not go into farming settled instead into the hamlets that served them, starting with Rhinecliff, where ferries crossed the river to Kingston. The completion of the railroad stimulated the development of not only Rhinecliff, which took that name in 1849 from the railroad station, but Barrytown as well, where an icehouse was built in what had previously been a landing between the Massena and Edgewater estates into a small community. Another hamlet, Staatsburg, sprung up around the station near William Dinsmore's \\"Locusts on Hudson\\" in the 1860s and 70s. Wilderstein, a late 19th- century estate house As the century wore on, into the Victorian period, the houses became more idiosyncratic and individualistic. Estates like Wyndcliffe, Wilderstein, Ferncliff and Rokeby sported towers and other ornamentation. By 1865, there were thirty such houses. The Livingstons' hold on the area diminished through the continuing divisions of their property and the abolition of three-life leases under a new state constitution in 1840. Newer families, such as the Astors, moved in to take their place. Many of their homes were set among the winding rural roads that had served to divide the farmed portions of property, closer to the river, from the estates and surrounding gardens. They built picturesque stone walls and elaborate gateways that enhanced the rural character of the landscape but also served to emphasize the exclusivity of ownership. Private pathways and roads connected the newer estates directly to each other, further segregating the estate dwellers from the public. 20th century Livingston Manor's prestige began to diminish somewhat in the later years of the century. The new money of the Gilded Age had come from industrialization, not landownership, and preferred newer hot spots like Long Island and Newport for its summer mansions and retreats, or followed Jay Gould and the Rockefellers in building or improving estates further downriver, closer to the city. The influence of the newer wealth and its tastes on design and living was still felt along the Hudson most in the changed approach to the pleasure grounds around the estates. What had once been used for gardening and ornamental farms was now used for recreation, and some of the earliest golf courses, tennis courts and country clubs were built on the country seats. Mills Mansion, designed by Stanford White Some significant new buildings were added to the future district during this period. Stanford White converted Lewis's old home into a new mansion for Ogden Mills, as well as doing some renovations at Rokeby. Another Astor had Mott B. Schmidt design Valeur, and Charles A. Platt designed an American Renaissance home for the Chapman family. The last major country seat came when Harrie T. Lindeberg built Fox Hollow on the thousand acres (4 km¬≤) Tracy Dows had acquired. Stone Row dormitories built in the 1880s - Bard College In 1860, the Bard family had provided money so that a small Episcopal seminary near their Tivoli estate could be expanded into St. Stephen's College, later renamed after them. It eventually expanded into three of the former country seats. This was the beginning of a second life for some of the old country seats, as some moved out of private residential use and became institutions. The Catholic Church received Ellerslie, Ferncliff and Linwood, using them for various purposes. Dorothy Day made Rose Hill the location of one the Catholic Worker Movement's farms during the 1960s. By the 1930s, many of the old estate houses were becoming difficult to keep up and burdens on family fortunes that were being divided as the Livingstons' had once been. Some survived by selling and subdividing the farms to offset rising property taxes. Others, like Clermont, the Mills Mansion and Wilderstein, were eventually given to the public or private trusts and turned into museums of the life once led in them. The end of the country-seat era and of any major new construction locked the existing buildings and their architectural styles in place. At the same time the rise in automotive transportation and attendant road improvements, particularly the bridge, made the district more accessible than before. Preservation efforts in the wake of the establishment of the National Register of Historic Places led to the 1979 creation of the Clermont Estates Historic District in Columbia County and the Sixteen Mile District to its south. Shortly afterwards, the state Department of Environmental Conservation designated the area the state's first scenic district. Later research by the group Hudson River Heritage led to findings that the two needed to be combined into a larger district extending as far south as the Mills Mansion, and that it was significant and well preserved enough to be accorded National Historic Landmark District status. The National Park Service (NPS) added it to the list in 1990. The district today Due to the views and history, homes in the area still command a high price. The open space overlooking the river within the district is a source of constant development pressure on the district, as builders look to serve buyers priced out of growing suburbs further south in the valley yet still looking for a rail commute to the city via Amtrak or Metro-North (via Poughkeepsie). The district boundaries had to be drawn to exclude one newer subdivision near Staatsburg, but had to include one in Tivoli. To protect the district's historic character, the Town of Rhinebeck, at least a third of which is included in it, has adopted local ordinances which govern the potential demolition of historic buildings as well as creating a special historic-preservation zoning district for those areas. NY 199 in Rhinebeck.|alt=A sign with the headline \\"Landmark District\\" in yellow on a blue background, with yellow trim, behind an evergreen tree on its left. There are some trees in back. The other municipalities with land in the district have not gone quite to this extent. Hyde Park has created a historic overlay district which applies to all historic properties in the town, providing in the case of the Hudson River Historic District that land use within its boundaries \\"shall obtain site plan approval and shall be limited to an agriculture, water-dependent and/or water-enhanced use or to a use appropriate to preservation of the historic resources of the district\\".Town Code, Hyde Park, New York, ¬ß 108-4.6.A. Accessed at generalcode.com November 24, 2007. Clermont, Red Hook and Tivoli have so far not chosen to apply any additional standards and continue to preserve the district through their existing zoning and applicable New York state laws requiring historical and environmental reviews in certain areas. The district's boundaries have not been expanded since its creation and designation, but there is some interest in doing so. The Town of Germantown has formally expressed its intention to have the northern boundary extended from the Clermont line to the hamlet of Germantown. Aesthetics The estate houses generally followed the pattern established by Clermont ‚Äî a house with a river and mountain view surrounded by \\"pleasure grounds\\", with an approach road from the east so as to reveal the vista only at the house. The farm leaseholds were usually located further inland. This accounts for the large areas of open space still apparent in the district today. The tenant farms also boasted distinct architecture, mostly vernacular styles. Most notable among them would have been the wooden, center- aisled New World Dutch barn, often built before the farmhouse. In the pre- industrial era, it could store all the animals and equipment necessary for growing and harvesting wheat, the region's primary cash crop, as well as the harvest itself. Several remain standing. The Stone Jug Farmhouses were, in the colonial era, often small two-story structures. It was not uncommon for them to be razed if the landlord desired to extend the estate to the farm property and move the tenants further east; as a result most of the surviving ones are made out of stone, such as Clermont's Stone Jug and Rhinebeck's Fredenburg House, since they were harder to demolish. Later in the 18th century, after independence, the tenants' homes echoed the Neoclassical aspirations of their landlords, as well as similar trends in Germany. Around Clermont, some two- story wood-frame farmhouses with five-bay facades and centrally-located entrances remain from this period. The advent of Romanticism began to show in the farmhouses around the mid-19th century, shortly after its debut in the estates. Like their neoclassical predecessors, they took as much inspiration from popular German forms as from the landowners' homes. The farmhouses built during this period are large, square, hipped-roof structures with ponderous cornices and large porches to match. While there are no houses in this style left in the district, some older barns and other farm buildings show it. Church stylings gradually show some difference between those where the landlords worshipped and their tenant counterparts. Early churches hosted both, with the oldest example in the district being the plain white frame Red Church along Route 9G in Red Hook, dating to the early years of the 19th century. Later on, the wealthy began building churches and chapels for their private or exclusive use, and these, such as the chapel on the Clarkson property on 9G, show more ornament than the older churches. The O'Brien General Store, a prominent commercial property in Rhinecliff. The hamlets, particularly Rhinecliff and Tivoli, also reflect the area's original land distributions. Many of their houses are small two-story frame structures in Victorian styles that occupy small lots on narrow streets. Commercial buildings, in the core neighborhoods, usually occupy the ground floors of such houses or small brick buildings. The landowners often donated money for various public buildings like churches and schools, such as Rhinecliff's Morton Memorial Library. Cultural legacy The district has influenced American culture and history beyond its art and architecture. In 1807, Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat, stopped at Clermont for an hour on its maiden voyage up the Hudson. It was the first commercial steamship voyage; the boat itself would later be renamed Clermont in recognition of Robert Livingston's patronage and investment. Several statesmen have called the district home besides the many from the Livingston-Beekman family. Egbert Benson, a congressman, federal judge and New York's first attorney general, built his law practice in what would later be Tivoli. John Winthrop Chanler, another congressman, married Margaret Astor Ward, who had inherited Rokeby through her Livingston / Astor forebearers. His son Lewis served as a state assemblyman and lieutenant governor. Another son, William Chanler, also served briefly in Congress. Another son, Robert, was Dutchess County sheriff and an accomplished painter. John Watts de Peyster, Civil War general, military historian and adjutant general of the New York National Guard, also spent some of his formative years at Rose Hill in Tivoli, and later built the firehouse now used as village hall. Another New York Civil War figure, Charles S. Wainwright, lived at The Meadows. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ancestral home in Hyde Park is just south of the district, but some of his Delano ancestors were longtime residents of the Steen Valetje estate. As a child, his wife Eleanor lived at Oak Lawn, the Tivoli estate of her grandmother Mary Ludlow Hall, for several years after the death of her mother. The district has had a role in literature as well, both as a setting and a residence. Henry James, a frequent visitor to his uncle's home at Linwood, makes several references to Rhinebeck and other locales within the district in his writings. Edith Wharton, likewise a childhood visitor to her aunt at Wyndclyffe, used the district as a setting in many of her works. Thomas Wolfe lived in a gatehouse at Fox Hollow while writing Look Homeward, Angel, and Aldous Huxley lived there for a time in the 1930s. Bard's Fisher Center Bard College has played an increasing role in the district's cultural impact. Its faculty has included Hannah Arendt and John Dewey, and the former is buried there with her second husband Heinrich Bl√ºcher. The college's alumni have included many figures in late 20th-century popular culture. Two of them, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, cofounded the rock group Steely Dan, and wrote two songs about Bard and places near it: \\"My Old School\\", from Countdown to Ecstasy; and \\"Barrytown\\", on Pretzel Logic. In 2003, the Frank Gehry-designed Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts brought innovative contemporary architecture back to the district. The irregularly-shaped metal panels on its roof echo the view of the Catskills across the river, the district's original attraction.

He was the father of Brutus, the assassin of Julius Caesar. Family He was the first husband to Servilia, the elder half-sister of Cato the Younger. His son by Servilia is the Marcus Junius Brutus who was one of the chief assassins of Julius Caesar. Power struggle and death In 77 BC Brutus, in command of the forces in Cisalpine Gaul, allied himself with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who as consul had tried to undo Sulla‚Äôs settlements. Lepidus raised an army, which was defeated outside Rome by Quintus Lutatius Catulus. Brutus took his own forces to Mutina, where he defended the stronghold against Pompey the Great, who had been sent by the Senate to dislodge him. He withstood Pompey's attacks for a while, but was eventually forced to surrender, after which he was allowed to retire to the town of Regium Lepidi, where he was murdered by Pompey's close ally Geminius. According to Plutarch, > For Brutus, whether he himself betrayed his army, or whether his army > changed sides and betrayed him, put himself in the hands of Pompey, and > receiving an escort of horsemen, retired to a little town upon the Po.

This \\"CD Project as Benefit\\" was conceived and created by the online community of progressive music fans and artists at the Spock's Beard website forum. A short run of the resulting double CD was financed solely by members of the board, and sold out almost immediately. 100% of the proceeds (just over $10,000.00) was donated to benefit the victims of the Tsunami. Along with the many (relatively unknown) artists from all over the world who contributed to the album, a few famous progressive rockers donated submissions as well - Neal Morse (formerly of Spock's Beard) and Nick D'Virgilio (of Spock's Beard) each contributed demo tracks, prominent progsters IZZ, IQ and Din Within all have a track on the album, and Ajalon had a song that featured keyboard solos by Rick Wakeman, best known for his work with Yes. The project was originally the brainchild of Barry Thompson (known on the forum as KirksNoseHair); much of the technical work was handled by Brian Cobb (a.k.a. Brians Split Personality) - he also managed the financial end of producing the album and collecting the money for donation to the Tsunami charity.

These included the Statue of Liberty, Cape Canaveral, Disney Land, Notre Dame de Paris, and the World Trade Center. Tseng also took tens of thousands of photographs of New York graffiti artist Keith Haring throughout the 1980s working on murals, installations and the subway. In 1984, his photographs were shown with Haring's work at the opening of the Semaphore Gallery East location in a show titled \\"Art in Transit\\".

The genus is named for the Russian phycologist Mikhail Iljitsch Golenkin.Baker, A.L. et al. 2012.Golenkinia at Phycokey ‚Äì an image-based key to Algae (PS Protista), Cyanobacteria, and other aquatic objects. University of New Hampshire Center for Freshwater Biology. 7 April 2018. Golenkinia species live in fresh water (including bodies of black water such as Winyah Bay) and are found around the world.  Description  Members of Golenkinia are spherical unicellular organisms with numerous radiating spines. Their cell walls are notably thick, which distinguishes them from members of the genus Golenkinopsis. They contain a single walled cup-shaped chloroplast, which in turn contains a pyrenoid in its base. The pyrenoid is typically sheathed in starch. Species of Golenkinia are typically solitary and do not form colonies or coenobia except under laboratory conditions. Their slender spines may become entangled, creating the false impression that the algae have formed a colony.  Taxonomic status  The precise taxonomic status of Golenkinia is somewhat unclear due to the large number of revisions it has undergone. It has traditionally been classed with other round, spine-bearing green algae, many of which are now assigned to the class Trebouxiophyceae. In 1982, Hanu≈° Ettl and Ji≈ô√≠ Kom√°rek placed Golenkinia with Chlorotetraedron and Polyedriopsis in the family Neochloridaceae, under the order Sphaeropleales. In 1983, Kom√°rek and Bohuslav Fott created the family Golenkiniaceae to contain unicellular algae with round cells that had spines on the cell wall. The genera Golenkinia and Polyedriopsis were placed within it. Subsequent analysis of 18S rDNA in 2003 has found that Golenkinia and Polyedriopsis are not in fact closely related. The same research assigned Golenkinia to the order Chlamydomonadales. Further analysis in 2015 found that Golenkinia was loosely related to Jenufa and Treubaria, all together possibly representing a branch in Chlamydomonadales that would be a sister clade to order Sphaeropleales. This proposed clade remains unnamed, and its taxonomy is still not completely clear, despite further rDNA analysis performed in 2017. Because of the frequent changes to its classification, some databases still show Golenkinia belonging to either Golenkiniaceae or Neochloridaceae despite the more recent research showing this is not accurate.

Geneseo has a remarkably well-preserved 19th-century streetscape, with Victorian architecture embodying a picturesque style advocated by architect Andrew Jackson Downing. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977; an enlarged district was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Description and history Geneseo was founded in 1790 by William and James Wadsworth, whose descendants exerted a significant influence on the development of the community. In addition to their philanthropic and business contributions to the town, the Wadsworths planted many oak trees, with the result that the village now has a large number of mature trees approaching 200 years or more in age. The town served as a market center for the surrounding rural agricultural areas in the first half of the 19th century, and was boosted economically by the establishment of a state normal school (now SUNY Geneseo) on a campus west of the village's commercial district. The downtown suffered a devastating fire in 1864, but was rebuilt. The district includes Geneseo's historic commercial center and its most refined residential neighborhood, plus the estate of the Wadsworth family. That estate, The Homestead (Geneseo) was already separately listed in 1974. The district consists of 312 properties, of which 288 are contributing. The district's buildings are stylistically somewhat diverse, with Italianate and Queen Anne Victorian styles of the second half of the 19th century dominating. Many older homes, originally built in the Federal style, were later renovated into these styles. and Properties Properties included in the district include: *Temple Hill Cemetery *Avon Road, east side: **The Hartford House, c. 1836, another Wadsworth family property. *Avon Road, west side: **Soldiers Monument **St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church **St. Mary's Rectory *Center Street, north side: **Thirty residences and buildings, from 3 Center Street up to 81 Center Street **Central Presbyterian Church (c.1939) *Center Street, south side: ** ... *2nd St. **Wadsworth Library *Geneseo Baptist Church *Old Antheum Library (to be expanded) See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Livingston County, New York *List of National Historic Landmarks in New York References  External links  * Geneseo, New York, Historic Landmark Village Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Category:Historic districts in Livingston County, New York Category:Houses in Livingston County, New York Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Livingston County, New York ","title":"Geneseo Historic District"},{"id":"13131640","text":"Gongrosira is a genus of green algae in the family Chaetophoraceae.

It has been the cathedral of the Diocese of Saint-√âtienne since its creation on 26 December 1970. The building was constructed as an elaborate parish church between 1912 and 1923 in a primitive neo-Gothic style, on a Latin cross groundplan with transept and triple nave, and a belltower on the west front. The building is long, wide and from the centre of the roof vault to the ground. The organ in the choir dates from 1930, and there is another very imposing one by A. Durand from 1968. The building was a highly ambitious one from the start, and remains unfinished.  History  The project of a large church for a new parish was decided upon in 1830 to serve the rising population of the city consequent upon its industrial growth. The dedication to Charles Borromeo was an indirect compliment to the then monarch, Charles X. Forez-info.com: Histoire de la Cath√©drale Saint- Charles A provisional chapel was built in the Rue √âmile Combes in 1829, although only dedicated in 1840, as a temporary measure while the new large church was constructed. In the event the provisional structure had to serve until 1923. The extreme delay was due to sustained obstruction from the secularist authorities, which had disastrous consequences for the progress of the new church of Saint-√âtienne. Plans for an impressive church were accepted in the 1860s, drawn up by Pierre Bossan, architect to the Archdiocese of Lyon, where his most significant work was the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re. After many years in storage they were destroyed in a fire, and had to be reconstructed by , from preliminary drawings by Bossan's partner, Giniez, which had been kept by his children. The local architect who finally built the church from them was Francisque Dodat. The first stone was blessed on 3 November 1912 by Monsignor D√©chelette, Auxiliary Bishop of Lyons. However, two years later, the start of World War I further delayed construction until 1919. By that time inflation had reduced the value of the endowment and there was a shortage of labour, and the church that was eventually built, which was finished on 20 November 1923 but not consecrated until 23 May 1933 by Cardinal Maurin, Archbishop of Lyons, was significantly less than what had been planned: it is missing three of the intended four belltowers and a dome, as well as quantities of external and internal decorations. In 1970, the church was elevated to a cathedral when the Diocese of Saint-√âtienne was created. On this occasion, the choir was remodelled to conform to the liturgical prescriptions of the Second Vatican Council. In 2005, at the instigation of the Abb√© Martin, rector, the layout was completed by the creation of an episcopal cathedral coherent with the altar and the ambo, on drawings by the architect Michel Goyet. Built after the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, it is one of the few cathedrals in France owned by the diocese, which is wholly responsible for its upkeep.

She was one of the four ships of the Caledon sub-class. Assigned to the Grand Fleet during the war, the ship participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in late 1917. Caradoc was briefly deployed to the Baltic in late 1918 supporting anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic and then was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1919 and spent the next year and a half doing the same thing in the Black Sea during the Russian Civil War. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in mid-1920 to observe the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì22 and the Chanak Crisis of late 1922. Caradoc spent most of the rest of her time between the World Wars overseas or in reserve with deployments to the Far East and the North America and West Indies Station. Recommissioned before the start of World War II in September 1939, she returned to the North American Station where she helped to intercept two German blockade-runners. The ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942, but saw no action before she was converted into a training ship in mid-1943 in South Africa. Caradoc was sent to Ceylon where she became an accommodation ship in 1944. She briefly became the fleet flagship in August 1945 before returning home later in the year. The ship was placed in reserve at the end of the year and sold for scrap in early 1946. Design and description The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range.Friedman, pp. 38, 42, 48 The Caledon sub-class was a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding Centaur sub-class with a more powerful armament. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a deep draught of . Displacement was at normal and at deep load.Friedman, p. 387 Caradoc was powered by two geared Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of . The turbines used steam generated by six Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about . She carried tons of fuel oil. The ship had a crew of about 400 officers and other ranks; this increased to 437 when serving as a flagship.Gardiner & Gray, p. 60 The main armament of the Caledon-class ships consisted of five BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline. One gun was forward of the bridge, two were fore and aft of the two funnels and the last two were in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. The two QF 20-cwt anti- aircraft (AA) guns were positioned abreast the fore funnel. The torpedo armament of the Caledons was four times more powerful than that of the Centaurs, with eight torpedo tubes in four twin mounts, two on each broadside. The Caledons were protected by a waterline belt: thick and had a protective deck that was thick over the steering gear. The walls of the conning tower had a thickness of 3 inches. Construction and career Caradoc bombarding Bolshevik positions on Estonian coast. December 1918 Paravane maintenance Caradoc, the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 60 was ordered in December 1915Raven & Roberts, p. 62 as part of the 1915‚Äì16 War Programme. The ship was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Greenock shipyard on 21 February 1916. She was launched on 23 December 1916 and completed on 15 June 1917.Friedman, p. 413 She was assigned to the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet together with three other C-class cruisers. With her sister , she ran aground on Fair Isle on 15 August, but both ships were successfully refloated. Caradoc was back in action by 17 November when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Caradoc, being the rear ship in her squadron, fired the least. She did not score any hits on her opponents, nor did they damage her.McBride, pp. 110‚Äì15; Newbolt, pp. 165, 169‚Äì175 In 1917‚Äì18, her conning tower was replaced by an enlarged bridge and her rangefinders were exchanged for models.Raven & Roberts, p. 75 In November 1918, the ship was based at Rosyth and escorted the German High Seas Fleet as they sailed to Scapa Flow on 21 November to be interned. A few days later, the 6th LCS was ordered to the Baltic Sea to support the Baltic States as they attempted to secure their independence from Russia. While stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, en route, Caradoc pulled off the collier, , after she had run aground. Together with her half-sister and five destroyers, the ship bombarded Bolshevik positions with 155 six-inch shells east of Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, on 14 December and brought the Russian offensive to a halt after they destroyed the one bridge connecting them with Petrograd. Almost two weeks later, she helped to capture the near Reval on 27 December, which was later turned over to the Estonians. At the beginning of January 1919, Caradoc and her sister ferried 500 Finnish volunteers from Helsingfors (Helsinki) to Reval and then bombarded the Bolsheviks in conjunction with an Estonian offensive on 4 January. The 6th LCS was recalled immediately afterwards and arrived back in Rosyth on 10 January.Head, pp. 134‚Äì139; Transcript The ship was transferred to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet on 29 February.Halpern, p. 7 By 19 April she was stationed in the Crimea in support of the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army.Halpern, pp. 34, 36 On 22 April, aerial reconnaissance reported that the Red Army was massing at Kaffa Bay in the town of Vladislovovka. The and Caradoc bombarded the town, forcing the Soviet forces to withdraw.Whitley, p. 68 Joined by her half-sister , and the destroyer , Caradoc and Lemnos again bombarded Soviet troops two days later, this time in the village of Parpach. On 2 May, Caradoc and the newly arrived battleship helped to break up a Bolshevik attack. Three months later, she was hit by three 3-inch shells as she engaged Bolshevik coastal artillery at Ochakov, but suffered no casualties or damage. Later that month, she supported an amphibious landing by the Volunteer Army near Odessa. In mid-October, the ship supported a Volunteer Army offensive near Yalta.Halpern, pp. 41, 54, 100‚Äì110 Caradoc in Hamilton, Bermuda, ca. 1928 By April 1920, Caradoc was deployed off the coast of Georgia supporting the Volunteer Army against the Bolsheviks and continued to do so through May. She was withdrawn from Georgia in June in response to the Greek offensives during the Greco-Turkish War and arrived in Istanbul on 18 June. During the Chanak Crisis of September 1922, the ship was deployed to watch the Gulf of Smyrna. Caradoc participated in the withdrawal of ships from Turkish waters in December 1922 as the Treaty of Lausanne that ended the war was being negotiated.Halpern, pp. 199‚Äì200, 206‚Äì207, 214‚Äì215, 250, 373, 423 The ship remained in the Mediterranean until December 1926 when she was briefly transferred to the China Station. Around 1924‚Äì1926, she was fitted with a pair of 2-pounder (40 mm) Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" AA guns. After returning home, Caradoc began a lengthy refit from 15 September 1927 to October 1928 when she was assigned to the North America and West Indies Station. The ship remained there until February 1930 when she returned to the UK and was briefly placed in reserve. Caradoc was recommissioned in July for service on the China Station with the 5th Cruiser Squadron. She returned home four years later and was again placed in reserve on 17 October 1934. Second World War At the beginning of the war on 3 September 1939, Caradoc was at Portland HarbourRohwer, p. 1 and was reassigned to operate off the North American coast shortly afterwards. The following month, she ferried ¬£ two million of gold to Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 23 October the light cruiser and the Canadian destroyer spotted the German oil tanker Emmy Friedrich in the Yucat√°n Channel. When Caradoc stopped the ship, the Germans scuttled her to prevent her capture. On 11 December 1940 the German blockade runner Rhein was intercepted by the Dutch sloop Van Kinsbergen west of the Florida Strait. Rhein was set on fire by her own crew to prevent her capture and the wreck was sunk later that day by Caradoc.Rohwer, pp. 7, 51 The ship was refitted in New York City between 28 October 1941‚Äì26 February 1942 where her \\"pom-pom\\"s were exchanged for five Oerlikon light AA guns on single mounts. In addition Caradoc was fitted with a Type 271 and Type 290 surface-search radars.Raven & Roberts, p. 427 The ship was then assigned to the Eastern Fleet where she remained until 1943. She was converted into a gunnery training ship in Durban, South Africa, between 21 June‚Äì3 July, and was transferred to Colombo, Ceylon, in 1944. Caradoc became an accommodation ship in April 1944 and then the flagship of the East Indies Fleet, as the Eastern Fleet had been renamed, in August 1945. She was placed in reserve in December 1945 after she returned home. The ship was sold for scrap on 5 April 1946 and subsequently broken up at Briton Ferry, Wales.

He represented Rainy River in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario initially as a Liberal-Conservative in 1911, and then as a Conservative from 1914 to 1923 and 1926 to 1929. Biography Having worked in his youth as a log driver on the Mississippi River, Mathieu came to Rainy River from Minnesota around 1903 as a manager of the Rainy River Lumber Company's sawmill, later becoming manager and vice-president at the Shevlin- Clarke Company. He was later involved in controversy as part of what became known as the \\"Old Tory Timber Ring,\\" when fellow Conservative Howard Ferguson, as Minister of Lands and Forests, arranged for the sale of three timber limits in the Quetico Forest Reserve to Shevlin-Clarke for less than half the price they would have normally fetched, and the company later paid a fine of $1.5 million for breaching the Crown Timber Act., discussing the adoption of The transactions were criticized in a subsequent inquiry. In 1921, he left Shevlin-Clarke and founded J.A. Mathieu Limited, which set up a mill at Rainy Lake. The company opened another sawmill in 1945 at Sapawe Lake, near Atikokan. He was instrumental in pioneering the use of mechanized equipment in the woods (while other firms were still relying mainly on horses), as well as in using aircraft. After his death, the company was acquired by Domtar. He set up an educational foundation to provide financial assistance for students from the area, for which he was honoured in 1958 by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation. Mathieu also established a wildlife reserve and help fund community projects in the region. During his time in the provincial assembly, he helped promote the development of roads to encourage settlement in the district. He also served as President of the Northern Pine Manufacturers Association for 22 years.

Early career After serving a long apprenticeship as a clapper boy in the 1940s, with Britain's Army Film Unit, Davis eventually worked his way up to focus puller and camera operator in low-budget British films of the 1950s. By the 1960s, Davis worked as a camera operator on such internationally acclaimed films as A Taste of Honey, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Freud: The Secret Passion (directed by John Huston) and Tom Jones, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Director Davis made his directorial debut in 1964 with Girl with Green Eyes winning the US National Board of Review award for Best Director. His best known film is the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans. Davis reunited with the two female stars of Girl with Green Eyes, Rita Tushingham and Lynn Redgrave, in Smashing Time (1967), a comedy set in 1960s swinging London. At the 1966 San Sebastian International Film Festival, he won the Golden Seashell award for I Was Happy Here, which starred Sarah Miles. In the 1970s Davis took a long hiatus from feature films, and turned his focus on television for work, including episodes of Follyfoot and The New Avengers, as well as an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure in the BBC Television Shakespeare series. After directing Clash of the Titans, he directed the 1985 feature film adaptation of Agatha Christie's Ordeal by Innocence starring Donald Sutherland and Faye Dunaway. Davis also directed the 1983 television adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's The Sign of Four with Ian Richardson as Sherlock Holmes. He continued his work in television, directing a version of Camille with Greta Scacchi and Colin Firth in 1984 and the British drama series The Chief.

Data extracted from the Micromonas Manton & Parke, 1960, non Borrel, 1902, World Register of Marine Species, accessed March 6, 2010 Before the characterization in 2016 of a second species, Micromonas commoda, Micromonas pusilla was considered to be the only species in the genus, which led to a disproportionate amount of research discussing a single species within the genus. It is suggested to be the dominant photosynthetic picoeukaryote in some marine ecosystems. Unlike many marine algae, it is distributed widely in both warm and cold waters.Genomes of Two Strains of Micromonas Algae Show Surprising Diversity , Alternative Energy Newswire, April 10, 2009 It is a strong swimmer and exhibits a phototaxic response. Micromonas pusilla is divided into 3 to 5 different clades despite their similarity in morphologies and habitats. Varying ratios of clades contribute to the M. pusilla population throughout the marine ecosystem leading to the hypothesis of clades arising based on niche occupation and susceptibility to virus infection.  Discovery  Micromonas pusilla is considered the first picoplankton studied, when it was discovered and named Chromulina pusilla in the 1950s by R. Butcher. Later, electron micrographs by the English scientists, Irene Manton and Mary Park, in the 1960s provided further details on M. pusilla.  Cell morphology and structure  Micromonas is a group of small unicellular pear-shaped micro-algae that do not have a cell wall. Just like other members in the class, they have a single mitochondrion and a single chloroplast, which covers almost half of the cell. They are able to swim due to the presence of a scale-less flagellum. The axonemal structure of the flagellum for this genus is different in that the peripheral microtubules do not extend up to the termination of the central pair of microtubules, allowing a visible investigation of the motion of the central pair. In Micromonas, the central pair constantly rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, despite the motion of other components of the flagellum. While the cell size, shape and the location of insertion of the flagellum into the cell are similar among strains and genetic clades, the variation in respective hair point length results in different lengths of the flagella within the genus. Antibiotic The antibiotic susceptibility was determined using a single strain of M. pusilla with the purpose to produce axenic cultures to be used in studies and experiments. The strain of M.pusilla was tested with a range of antibiotics to determine the possible effects of the particular antibiotic. Resistance: benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin Sensitive: chloramphenicol, polymyxin B For M. pusilla, sensitivity towards an antibiotic is likely defined by the impairment of growth, rather than a lethal effect, when subjected to bactericidal levels of that particular antibiotic. The susceptibility of other strains of M. pusilla towards this set of antibiotics should be the same.  Genetics   Evolutionary history  Micromonas diverged early on from the lineage that led to all modern terrestrial plants. Individual species have very similar 16S SSU rRNA gene sequences, a comparison often used to determine microscopic speciation, however, only 90% of different genes are shared between all Micromonas species. This presence or absence of complete genes, compared with only small changes of sequence to specific genes, suggests that Micromonas is the result of intensive horizontal gene transfer.  Strain Isolation  The original Micromonas reference genome was created from a strain, RCC299, first isolated in 1998 from an Equatorial Pacific sample. This strain has been continuously cultured for two decades and is available from the Roscoff Culture Collection. In 2005, a monoclonal culture of the strain was isolated. The axenic strain is available from the Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton, under the name CCMP2709. Currently, a separate stain that was isolated from temperate coastal waters is being sequenced.  Genome Structure  The entire Micromonas sp. genome was first shotgun sequenced in 2014. Micromonas has about 19Mb, however this varies slightly between species and strain. This is made up of 17 chromosomes and contains 59% GC content.NCBI Micromonas Genome Repository https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/2297 Based on [open reading frames] the genome codes for about 10000 proteins and 70 functional RNAs.JPI KEGG genome, micromonas comoda http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=mis  Cellular mechanisms   Cell growth and division  Micromonas reproduces asexually through fission. It has been observed that M. pusilla shows variability in optical characteristics, for example cell size and light scattering, throughout the day. There is an increase in these measurements during the period with light, followed by a decrease during period without light. This coincides with the findings that proteomic profiles change over the diel cycle, with an increase in expression of proteins related to cell proliferation, lipid and cell membrane restructuring in the dark when cells start dividing and become smaller. However, the expression levels of genes and proteins can still vary within the same metabolic pathway. It has also been suggested that the structure of 3‚Äô UTR may play a role in the regulatory system.  Light-harvesting system  Micromonas species still share the same collection of photosynthetic pigments as the members of the class Mamiellophyceae, which includes the common pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, as well as prasinoxanthin (xanthophyll K), the first algal carotenoid being assigned with a structure that has a Œ≥-end group. It has been discovered that most of its xanthophylls are in the oxidized state and show similarities to ones possessed by other important marine planktons like diatoms, golden and brown algae, and dinoflagellates. In addition, there is another pigment called Chl cCS-170 can be found in some strains of Micromonas and Ostreococcus living in deeper part of the ocean, which may indicate a potential adaptation for organisms that reside under low light intensity. The light-harvesting complexes of Micromonas are distinguishable from other green algae in terms of pigment composition and stability under unfavorable conditions. It has been showed that these proteins use three different pigments for light harvesting, and they are resistant to high temperature and the presence of detergent.  Peptidoglycan biosynthesis  Even though the chloroplasts, which are suggested to be originated from Cyanobacteria via endosymbiosis, from Micromonas do not have a surrounding peptidoglycan layer, the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway is found to be complete in M. pusilla and partial in M. commoda, with the presence of some relevant enzymes only. While the role of this pathway for Micromonas is still under investigation, this observation shows a lineage for different species of Micromonas along with glaucophyte algae which still have their chloroplasts covered with peptidoglycan.  Ecological significance  Micromonas make up a significant amount of picoplanktonic biomass and productivity in both oceanic and coastal regions. The abundance of Micromonas has increased over the past decade. Evidence shows these spikes in numbers are induced through climate change, which has been felt more drastically in the Arctic. In past years it was thought that green algal species were solely photosynthetic only to discover that was not the case. Micromonas, as well as the Prasinophytes, have taken on mixotrophic lifestyles and have huge impacts on prokaryotic populations within the Arctic. Due to the large consumption of prokaryotes by Micromonas, studies are suggesting photosynthetic picoeukaryotes will soon dominate the primary productivity and bacterivory of Arctic systems. Laboratory studies have shown that species within a single genus have altered their mixotrophic strategies to their distinct environments. These environments can differ through light intensity, nutrient availability and size of prey which all have shown clade- specific alterations to maximize efficiencies.  Viral infection  Viruses are important in the balance of marine ecosystem by regulating the composition of microbial communities, but their behaviors can be affected by several factors including temperature, mode of infection and host conditions. There is an increasing number of Micromonas-infecting virus being discovered and studied.  Micromonas pusilla virus  There are currently 45 viral strains identified that coexist with M. pusilla populations. Virus infectivity is dependent on the host strain, light availability and virus adsorption. Per day average of death due to virus lysis is estimated to be about 2 to 10% of the M. pusilla population. * Micromonas pusilla reovirus (MpRV): The first isolation of a reovirus that infects protist. This virus is found to be bigger than other members of the family.  Micromonas polaris virus  It is the first phycodnavirus being isolated from polar ocean waters. It can infect M. polaris, which is the polar ecotype of Micromonas that has adapted to waters with low temperatures. Evidence suggests that the increase in temperature due to climate change may shift the clonal composition of both the virus and host.  Metabolic engineering  With the growing population in the world, there is an increased demand for wild fishes and algae for their source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which is required for growth and development, as well as the maintenance of health in humans. Recent research is investigating an alternative mechanism for production of PUFA by using acyl-CoA Œî6-desaturase, an enzyme present in M. pusilla, with plants. The M. pusilla strain of acyl-CoA Œî6-desaturase is highly effective in the polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway due to its strong binding preference for omega-3 substrates in land plants.

It reported the splitting of the atom, the chemical identification of Vitamin C, the finishing of the Dutch dam around the Zuyder Zee and developments in television. Looking to the future it asked ‚ÄúAre Whales Doomed?‚Äù, discussed the possibility of stereoscopic cinema, and reported biofuels and power from the sea.

It was released in late 2010 in two hardcover volumes: Your Story with the rules information and Our World with setting information, and won numerous awards at all of the Origins Awards, the ENnies, and the Golden Geek Awards.RPG Geek profile of The Dresden Files Game The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game is written as an in-universe artifact: a draft of tabletop role-playing game written by Billy Borden in order to explain to both his werewolf pack and to mortals how the supernatural world works. He hopes that in-universe it will allow him to reveal the weaknesses of supernatural creatures, making the rest of the supernatural world as vulnerable as the publication of Dracula made \\"Black Court\\" Vampires. Because it is supposedly a draft copy of the game, the book is covered in annotations by Harry Dresden, Bob the talking skull, and Billy Borden and these take the form of highlights, notes in the margin, and post-it notes attached to the pages both as explanations of the rules and as snark between the characters. It is also split into two separate books; \\"Your Story\\" containing the rules and setting notes, and \\"Our World\\" containing a list of the movers and shakers in the Dresden Files universe as well as statistics for most supernatural creature types in the Dresden Files universe along the lines of a monster manual in Dungeons & Dragons. While the game does not specify a city to use (or even to use a city at all), the key world-building example of the game is based around Baltimore, rather than using the main setting of the novels (Chicago). This is both to avoid duplication of information already in the novels and so Harry Dresden and the canon of The Dresden Files need not be an issue for roleplay at the table.Designing Dresden 1: Choosing a City- Evil Hat Productions Volume One: Your Story The first volume of the core Dresden Files RPG, this book covers \\"all the rules you need to build characters and tell your own stories in the Dresdenverse\\". It is a stand alone book and does not require an additional purchase of the Fate Core RPG Rules. The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game uses the Fate system; a very narrative system in which each character doesn't just have skills and attributes but aspects; freeform traits that are true and can be made relevant to the narrative for a bonus - or for a penalty and a Plot Point to use later. Fate was chosen over the more popular open gaming d20 system because it makes it easier for characters with very different power levels to work together without one overshadowing the other.Designing Dresden 6 - So Why Fate? - Evil Hat Productions The characters are assumed to know each other in advance, and character creation includes inventing a couple of stories in their shared past. The magic system is broken up into immediate Evocation and planned Thaumaturgy, with the casting itself being freeform and the role being to control the magic. Volume Two: Our World The second volume in the core Dresden Files RPG, this book gives \\"extensive detail on the factions, creatures, foes, and allies of the Dresdenverse\\". It also includes a section on the Chicago setting used in the Dresden novels. Volume Three: The Paranet Papers The third volume in the core Dresden Files RPG, this book provides information on \\"four key Dresdenverse times and places: Las Vegas, the Russian Revolution, the Neverglades, and Las Tierras Rojas / the Red Lands\\". In addition it details rules and setting information for navigating the spirit world known as the Nevernever. The magical rules are updated and expanded with new material on soulfire, sponsorship, and thaumaturgy. There are new and updated creatures to populate your game and provide possible opposition for you players, including demons, archangels, creatures of the Nevernever, and scions. Character writeups are updated and new characters are introduced to the Dresdenverse. Information for Dresden Files novels is updated through the novel Changes, with hints of Ghost Story. Dresden Files Accelerated Published in 2017 using the Fate Accelerated system, Dresden Files Accelerated simplifies the rules and is a standalone game from the rest of the Dresden Files RPG. https://www.evilhat.com/home/dresden-files- accelerated/ History and reception Jim Butcher, author of The Dresden Files, was an old friend of some of the founders of Evil Hat Productions. When Butcher's agent, Jennifer Jackson, started receiving queries about roleplaying rights to the series, Butcher contacted Evil Hat to create and publish a Dresden Files RPG. Evil Hat brought in Genevieve Cogman to do the research on the six Dresden Files that had been written by that time in 2004, as well as the ten more that were written by the time Evil Hat decided to put a cap on what the game would cover several years later. They also announced in 2006 that they'd needed to discard the alpha version of The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game and go right back to the drawing board, and that Spirit of the Century would use the first version of the engine they'd created for The Dresden Files RPG.Where'd we go? - Evil Hat Productions Jim Butcher announced that Evil Hat Productions had the Dresden Files license in December 2004 and that they were due to launch the game in Summer 2006.The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game Wears an Evil Hat - Jim Butcher, December 16, 2004 - archive.org link Evil Hat started recruiting playtesters for The Dresden Files in late 2007, starting external play-testing in January 2008Evil Hat announcement, January 2008 and playtesting continued through 2008 and 2009. The game was opened for preorders in April 2010 and released in June 2010, to coincide with Origins 2010. In January 2014, as a part of the Fate Core Kickstarter, Evil Hat announced lighter version of the Dresden Files RPG called Dresden Files Accelerated to be launched in late 2014.Fate Core Kickstarter, Update #24 Reception was extremely positive with The Dresden Files winning numerous awards, listed below. RPGamer awarded Dresden Files 5/5 and declared \\"This a game where every mechanic, every example and the humour oozes of the Dresden Files setting, and even if you aren't a fan, it still delivers a well put together urban fantasy game or an awesome magic system you can hack into your current FATE game. I have no complaints, no constructive criticism, not one ill word for this book.

Within this landmarked area are three architecturally significant, pre-Civil War mansions and their grounds; a 10,000-year-old Paleo-Indian site and viewshed; a private cemetery, and a nature preserve. It is one of only 11 National Historic Landmark Districts in New York State and the only National Historic Landmark District in Westchester County. It touches on the south side of the nation's oldest road, the Boston Post Road (US 1), which extends through Rye. A sandstone Westchester Turnpike marker \\"24\\", inspired by Benjamin Franklin's original mile marker system, is set into a wall that denotes the perimeter of three of the contributing properties. The district reaches to Milton Harbor of Long Island Sound. Two of the properties included in the National Park designation are anchored by Greek Revival buildings; the third property is dominated by a Gothic Revival structure that was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis. This district, which also has immense archaeological significance and importance to Native American, European-American and African- American heritage, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. and The meadow and viewshed is one of fewer than a dozen such identified Paleo- Indian sites in all of New York State. In 2005, J. Winthrop Aldrich, former assistant to six successive Commissioners of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (1974‚Äì1994) and Deputy Commissioner New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (1994-2003; 2007‚Äì2010), attested that the District was acknowledged to be \\"one of New York State's finest assets\\", \\"amply deserving the rare honor of National Historic Landmark designation by the Secretary of the Interior.\\" Components of the District Included within the district are the following historic buildings, structures and landscape features: Entrance of the 1838 Peter Augustus Jay House 1907 Van Norden Carriage House Lounsbury, also known as the Parsons Mansion Whitby Castle in winter 2010 Aerial of Marshlands Conservancy on Long Island Sound Jay Estate (1745 and earlier) The historic 23-acre Jay Estate, including its buildings, landscape and gardens, is being restored by the not-for-profit Jay Heritage Center. The site was added to the Westchester County African American Heritage Trail in 2004 by then County Executive Andrew Spano because of its association with John Jay and his lasting legacy to abolish slavery through law in his home state beginning in 1777, along with the efforts of his descendants: \\"With respect to the abolition of slavery in New York, no New Yorker was as persistent, politically skilled, and, ultimately, as legally effective as John Jay.\\" His legacy was complicated: while Jay was founder and president of the Manumission Society of New York, and signed legislation as governor to abolish slavery in 1799, he held enslaved African Americans as workers here until 1810. Free African Americans also worked for wages at his estates. This house was designated as a member site of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area in January 2009 because of 1) the architectural and historical significance of its buildings; 2) as significant parkland it illustrates the role of the Hudson River Valley in the modern environmental movement; 3) the site is associated with great Americans and social issues, particularly the examination of the abolition of slavery; and 4) because of its once notable formal gardens and landscape.Greenway Heritage Conservancy HRV, Inc. Hudson River Valley Heritage Area: Heritage Site Guidebook, 2010, p 14. Governor Andrew Cuomo added the site to New York State's \\"Path Through History\\" in 2013 for its ongoing relevance to the historic interpretation of Civil Rights in New York. The 1838 Peter Augustus Jay Mansion at the center of the property is owned outright by the Jay Heritage Center; it is one of two Greek Revival residences in the larger landmarked district. The mansion is situated on the site of the childhood home of American Founding Father John Jay, with approximately the same orientation and viewsheds. John Jay's house was built upon the footprint of an older 18th-century farmhouse, \\"The Locusts\\". Jay's eldest son, Peter Augustus Jay, replaced it with the current structure in the early nineteenth century. The mansion was constructed according to specifications in a contract between Jay and a builder named Edwin Bishop, and details appear to have been drawn from architectural pattern books by Minard Lafever and Chester Hills. Restoration of the house is an official Save America's Treasures project. **1907 Van Norden Carriage House (designed by Frank A.

It is a nature preserve with a diverse number of habitats - several ponds, an East Stream, West Creek, open meadow, woodland, salt marsh, and fresh water wetlands - that attract a variety of flora and fauna. Historically, the land was part of the larger old Jay Estate and the neighboring Parsons Estate. It was formed from two separate gifts in the 20th century: one of 120 acres given by Zilph Devereux to Westchester County on November 9, 1966, and another of 27 acres given by Fanny Wickes Parsons to Westchester County in December 1977. The resulting parcel of was rededicated as passive parkland in 1997 by Westchester County so that \\"The natural area and wildlife sanctuary will be protected, preserved and regulated as a nature and wildlife preserve to be used only for passive recreation.\\" It has been recognized as an Important Bird Area.

Hatton Castle to the south and Newbigging to the north lie within the parish boundary. The Railway Newtyle was the northern terminus for the first commercial railway in Scotland, the Dundee and Newtyle Railway which opened in 1831. The grid street plan of the central part of the village was laid out shortly after the railway opened and was intended to form the basis for a manufacturing centre which could take advantage of the communications link to Dundee.William Murdoch Duncan, (1979) Newtyle.

Mauger was archdeacon of Cap√©vreux and a royal clerk and physician before he was elected to the see of Worcester before 23 August 1199. His election, however, was quashed by Pope Innocent III because Mauger was illegitimate.British History Online Bishops of Worcester accessed on 3 November 2007 Against this decision he pleaded in person before the pope, who was so favourably impressed by him that he confirmed the election, issued a decretal on his behalf (Innocentii Decretalium Collectio, tit. iv.), and consecrated him at Rome on 4 June 1200. On his return to England he was enthroned at Worcester, and reverently replaced in the church the bones of Bishop Wulfstan, which had been disturbed by his predecessor, Bishop John of Coutances. Many miracles were claimed following this act. On 17 April 1202 the cathedral and other buildings were burnt. Apparently in order to raise funds to repair this disaster, the bishop and monks applied for the canonisation of Wulfstan, and satisfactory proof of the miracles having been given, their request was granted the following year. Mauger obtained a judgment subjecting the Abbey of Evesham to his jurisdiction, but the judgment was reversed by the pope. In 1207 Pope Innocent wrote to him and to the bishops of London and Ely bidding them urge King John to submit to the see of Rome, threatening him with an interdict, which they were to publish if he would not give way. They had an interview with John, and, their entreaties being in vain, pronounced the interdict on 23 March 1208. After this Mauger fled the kingdom secretly in company with the Bishop of Hereford, and his possessions were confiscated. At the king's bidding he returned with the bishops of London and Ely in the hope of an accommodation, but failed to persuade John, and after eight weeks returned to France. Innocent sent him and the other two bishops another letter bidding them pronounce the king's excommunication. They hesitated to obey, and sent the letter to the bishops remaining in England. Meanwhile they were blamed by some for having fled, and it was said that they lived in comfort, having left their flocks defenceless. In 1209 Mauger and the bishops of London and Ely were again sent for by the king, who commissioned the chief justiciar, Geoffrey FitzPeter, to arrange a reconciliation. The bishops landed in September, and discussed terms with the justiciar and other magnates at Canterbury. Mauger received back his manors and 100 pounds as an instalment of his losses. As, however, the king would not make full restitution, the negotiations fell through, and he and the two other bishops returned to France. He resided at the abbey at Pontigny, and died there on 1 July 1212,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 279 having before his death assumed the monastic habit.

It was named a National Historic Landmark in January, 1965, designated a New York City Landmark in November, 1965, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in October, 1966. and The district is bounded by Cadman Plaza West (Old Fulton Street) on the north, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway on the west, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and an irregular line that partly follows Clinton and Henry Streets on the east. It is of national significance as an early commuter suburb, and as a remarkably well-preserved 19th-century urban streetscape. Grace Episcopal Church, designed by Richard Upjohn, which held its first service in 1848, is in the district, as are Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Catholic Cathedral, the First Presbyterian Church, the First Unitarian Congregational Society, the Long Island (Brooklyn) Historical Society, the Heights Casino and Casino Apartments, Packer Collegiate Institute, and St. Ann's and the Holy Trinity Church, among other historically notable buildings., pp.230-235 The development of Brooklyn Heights as a fashionable residential area began with the introduction of ferry service to Manhattan in 1814. By the mid-19th century, the area was served by three ferry services as well as the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad, and it was one of New York's premier residential addresses. The latter distinction was eventually eclipsed by Fifth Avenue. Some of its streets are named for early real estate developers.

It is a photoautotrophic, nonmotile coenobial (fixed number of cells) green algae that inhabits freshwater environments. Reproduction Pediastrum reproduces asexually by producing autocolonies. The protoplast of each parent cell gives rise to a biflagellate zoospore for each cell in the parent colony. The zoospores are freed from the parent cell within a vesicle and then arrange themselves into the cellular arrangement for that particular species. The cells then enlarge until they reach full size. Each cell can generate a daughter autocolony with exactly the same number and arrangement of cells as the parent colony. Pediastrum reproduces sexually via the fusion of small, biflagellate gametes that are released from the parent cell. The zygotes germinate into zoospores, which turn into thick-walled polyeders that generate the new coenobia. These polyeders can also result from asexual reproduction.

(; 15 December 1891 ‚Äì 13 August 1976) was a French philosopher of the early and mid- 20th Century. His primary areas of research were in 17th- and 18th-century philosophy as well as the history of philosophy.  Biography  Gueroult was born on 15 December 1891 in the city of Le Havre in northwestern France. A veteran of both the First and Second World Wars, he was awarded the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur [Legion of Honour] and twice with the Croix de Guerre [Cross of War]. It was during his time as a prisoner of war in Germany that Gueroult began drafting his first philosophical work on Johann Gottlieb Fichte, later to become L‚Äô√âvolution et la structure de la doctrine de la science chez Fichte [The Evolution and Structure of Fichte‚Äôs Doctrine of Science].Jules Vuillemin, \\"Martial Gueroult ‚Ä† 13. 8. 1976,\\" Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie [Archive for the History of Philosophy] 59 (1977): 289. Gueroult‚Äôs first academic appointment was to the University of Strasbourg. In the 1930s, Gueroult spent some time at the University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil where he worked along with other French intellectuals such as Roger Bastide, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Pierre Monbeig and Ferdinand Braudel to develop the newly founded university‚Äôs social science programs.Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Charting A New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation, ed. Mauricio Font (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2001), 3. He would return to France to accept a position at the Sorbonne but in 1951, was named successor to √âtienne Gilson at the Coll√®ge de France. Gueroult re-titled his position as \\"Histoire et technologie des syst√®mes philosophiques\\" [\\"History and Technology of Philosophical Systems\\"] and it is here he would remain until his retirement in 1962.  Thought  Gueroult's work was characterized by a close attention to the History of Philosophy---which he considered as noble as philosophy itself‚Äîas well as a strong demand for systematicity. He also refused philosophical recourse to transcendence. A polemical debate opposed him to Ferdinand Alqui√© concerning Descartes, as Gueroult was studying him \\"according to the order of reasons\\" (synchronically), while Alqui√© was more interested in his historical evolution, studying him diachronically. Gueroult was interested in the \\"conditions of possibility of a history of philosophy\\" in general. He died before completing his opus titled Diano√©matique, which was composed of two books, the first one being titled History of the history of philosophy and the second one Philosophy of the history of philosophy. The second volume asked the question: how is a history of philosophy possible, given that philosophy aims as studying eternal truths, and that history is a school of skepticism?  Significance  Gueroult's influence has primarily been confined to France where his works have come to be seen as classics in the history of philosophy. He was highly influential on the thought of 20th- century French thinkers such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jules Vuillemin, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, Gilles Deleuze and Genevi√®ve Rodis-Lewis.

It is currently divided to two separate towns. East Imi woreda of the Gode Zone and West Imi woreda of the Afder Zone. The Shebelle River runs between these towns. It's located at an elevation of 442 meters above sea level. The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village's 2005 population. Imi hosts an airport (ICAO code HAIM) which consists of an unpaved airstrip about 1050 meters in length, possibly the shortest in an Ethiopian civil airport.  History  Probably the earliest European explorer to visit Imi was Arthur Rimbaud, who was working at the time as a commercial agent in Harar for the firm of Mazeran, Vinnay and Barday. In a report of his expeditions into the Somali state, dated 10 December 1883, Rimbaud proposed setting up a trading post at Imi(Iimeey), \\"a large, permanent village situated on the bank of the river, eight days from Harar by caravan.\\"Arthur Rimbaud, I promise to be good: the letters of Arthur Rimbaud, translated, edited and with an introduction by Wyatt Mason (New York: Modern Library, 2003), p. 189. This report was published the next year in the periodical Comptes rendus des s√©ances de la Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie. Near Imi, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael's troops had suffered a grievous defeat by the Ogaden warriors in 1890. A British hunter Colonel Swayne, who visited Imi(Iimeey) in February 1893, was shown \\"the remains of the bivouac of an enormous Abyssinian army which had been defeated some two or three years before.\\"H. G. C. Swayne, \\"A Trip to Harar and Im√©y\\", Geographical Journal, 2 (September 1893), p. 251 Italian explorers who visited Imi(Iimeey) early in 1891 found the once prosperous village \\"squalid\\" and miserable because of raids from Harar. A local landmark in Imi is the tomb of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, known as \\"Mad Mullah\\"; he died in 1921, but by the 1930s his tomb had become a shapeless heap of rubble.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 10 January 2008) In 1964 the Bale rebels attacked larger settlements, such as El-kare and Imi and, while they failed to capture them, they succeeded in gaining control of the rest of the district as smaller posts were abandoned by government forces. Of these two, Imi was the only one which the rebels at one point captured and held briefly. Twelve years later, 17 policemen were reported killed from an attack on Imi in October 1976. During the Somali westen War, well-armed guerillas besieged both two Imi's cities and other local towns.

He probably ruled in the south of the region later known as Swabia. There is little evidence to suggest the existence of an Aleman duke in the period from c. 610 to c. 630, but Fredegar records that around 631 an Alemannic army under duke Chrodobert participated in Dagobert I's assault on the realm of the Slavs to the east. The Alemannic host (exercitus Alamannorum) was one of the three columns of the Austrasian army (exercitus regnum universum Austrasiorum). While the Alemanni won a battle at an unknown location and the Lombard allies were successful against the Slavs in the Julian Alps, the main army of Austrasian Franks under Dagobert was defeated at the Battle of Wogastisburg. Chrodobert's authority in Alemannia probably increased after the succession of Sigebert III to the throne of Austrasia. The relationship between Chrodobert and both earlier and later dukes of the Alemanni is unknown. It is possible that Chrodobert was the same person as the Hruodi mentioned in the passio of Saint Killian. Sources *Geuenich, Dieter. Geschichte der Alemannen.

Rivera came to national attention on September 6, 2007, when he was indicted and arrested on charges of accepting bribes in exchange for agreeing to direct municipal contracts to an insurance broker acting as a cooperating witness. Rivera pleaded guilty to attempted extortion, stepped down as mayor, and was sentenced to 21 months in prison.Former Passaic mayor sentenced to 21 months He was succeeded in office by Gary Schaer.With Rivera out, Schaer takes the reins in Passaic Politicker NJ Early life Rivera began his career by joining the Passaic Police Department in 1968. In 1970, Rivera was brought up on police brutality charges. He avoided trial by resigning and returning to Puerto Rico, where he became a police officer as well. There, his law enforcement career ended when he was convicted of a felony and sentenced to either two or three years probation for offenses including admittedly slashing himself to simulate having been attacked in order to protect his partner, who killed a narcotics suspect. Rivera returned to Passaic in 1981 and became a private investigator. Political career Rivera ran for Passaic City Council in 1993 and 1995, losing both times. Later in 1995 he won a special election to the Council by 11 votes. He then ran a losing campaign for mayor in 1997, and then again in 2001, winning the race. New Jersey Governor Donald DiFrancesco attempted to prevent Rivera from taking office due to his status as a Puerto Rican felon, but Superior Court judge Robert Passero allowed Rivera to be sworn in, finding that the state had failed to prove that Rivera's crime was a crime of \\"moral turpitude\\". Rivera was a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition and, when he served as mayor, was a member of Hillary Clinton's Mayors Council and National Hispanic Leadership Council. During the course of his tenure as mayor, Rivera had the City Council nearly triple his salary from $40,000 to $117,000. Indictment and felony conviction On September 6, 2007, the FBI arrested 11 public officials and one civilian after a year-and-a-half long corruption investigation yielded grand jury indictments, against Rivera and other elected officials, including Assembly members Mims Hackett and Alfred E. Steele. Rivera was indicted for demanding and accepting money from John D'Angelo, an insurance broker acting as a cooperating witness for the FBI. D'Angelo pretended to be trying to get insurance coverage contracts from the City of Passaic. The indictment alleges that Rivera accepted a $5,000 bribe to steer insurance business with the City of Passaic and with the Passaic Valley Water Commission, bragging that \\"I can get four votes easy, easy, easy,\\" to a witness about his ability to obtain approval from the Passaic City Council. After appearing in front of a magistrate in Trenton and posting bail, Rivera resumed his duties the following day, Friday, September 7. State law permits elected officials to retain their offices even after they are convicted and sentenced; they can only be removed if they are formally impeached. Rivera had stated that he did not intend to resign. Nevertheless, he pleaded guilty to attempted extortion and resigned on May 9, 2008. In 2008, Rivera was sentenced to 21 months in prison. After serving 16 months at a Federal prison in Ohio, Rivera was transferred to a halfway house in New York, to serve the remainder of his 21-month felony sentence. Personal Rivera was born on a tobacco farm into a family of 14 children, where he lived until he moved to Passaic in 1963. Shortly thereafter, at age 17, he dropped out of 11th grade and married for the first time. Rivera suffered five strokes and married four times. He died at the age of 73 on May 1, 2020.

It is associated with programmed cell death (apoptosis) and regulates alternative splicing of the gene encoding the Fas receptor, an apoptosis-promoting protein. Under stress conditions, TIA1 localizes to cellular RNA-protein conglomerations called stress granules. It is encoded by the TIA1 gene. Mutations in the TIA1 gene have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Welander distal myopathy.  Function  This protein is a member of a RNA-binding protein family that regulates transcription and RNA translation. It was first identified in cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) target cells. TIA1 acts in the nucleus to regulate splicing and transcription. TIA1 helps to recruit the splicesome to regulate RNA splicing, and it inhibits transcription of multiple genes, such as the cytokine.Tumor necrosis factor alpha In response to stress, TIA1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it nucleates a type of RNA granule, termed the stress granule, and participates in the translational stress response. As part of the translational stress response, TIA1 works in cooperation with other RNA binding proteins to sequester RNA transcripts away from the ribosome, which allows the cell to focus its protein synthesis/RNA translation machinery on producing proteins that will address the particular stress. It has been suggested that this protein may be involved in the induction of apoptosis as it preferentially recognizes poly(A) homopolymers and induces DNA fragmentation in CTL targets. The major granule-associated species is a 15-kDa protein that is thought to be derived from the carboxyl terminus of the 40-kDa product by proteolytic processing. Alternative splicing resulting in different isoforms of this gene product have been described.

The five members of the band went to the United States by way of Japan in 1965. Career Formed in England in 1963 as the Steve Laine Combo, the group comprised Steve Laine (lead vocals), Ken Cox (guitar and vocals), Dave Burgess (bass and vocals), Ron Henley (keyboards, sax and vocals) and Jimmy May (drums and vocals). Despite the name, none of the group members were from Liverpool; all were Londoners except Burgess, who hailed from Cumbria. The group played in many major cities in Europe and Asia before achieving their greatest success in the United States, especially between 1965 and 1967. In Europe they recorded one album for CBS titled Tokio International, and a single \\"Tokio\\" / \\"SkinnyMinny\\", under the name '5Liverpools', a new name given to them by their German manager. While in Germany in 1964 the band successfully auditioned to tour Japan, and performed at the Tokyo Olympics. One UK single, \\"Lum D' Lum D' Lum High\\" / \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\", as the 'Liverpool 5', was released on the Pye subsidiary label, Piccadilly Records in 1964.[ Liverpool 5 Biography], AllMusic After touring Asia, where few other British rock bands had been, they moved to the US West Coast where they re- settled as residents in California. From their new base, they played all over the US and Canada, sometimes by themselves and other times with such notable acts as The Lovin' Spoonful, Stevie Wonder, The Kinks and The Rolling Stones. One of the band's biggest US concerts was as a featured artist on the 'Beach Boys Summer Spectacular' at the Hollywood Bowl in July 1965, alongside The Beach Boys, The Righteous Brothers and The Byrds. In the United States, under contract with RCA Victor, the group released a number of singles, together with two albums produced by Al Schmitt. In 1966 their recording of Chip Taylor's \\"Any Way That You Want Me\\" (b/w Oscar Brown Jr's \\"The Snake\\") would mark their only appearance on the national chart, spending one week on the Billboard Hot 100 at #98.Whitburn, Joel, Top Pop Singles 1955-1996, (C)1997 Record Research Inc. They also played on many television shows such as American Bandstand, Where the Action Is and Hullabaloo, plus many music shows on local stations throughout the US. Local radio stations often sponsored their concerts. Some sources claim the group were the first to record \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\", although the first released version was by Paul Revere and The Raiders. Two albums on RCA Victor, Arrive (LSP 3583) (1966) and Out of Sight (LSP 3682) (1967), were reasonably successful for the group, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The group disbanded in 1968 and by then Fred Dennis, later of the Sonics from Spokane, Washington had replaced Dave Burgess on bass.Drummer Jimmy May returned to live in England while the others remained in the United States and embarked on new careers in various professins. Before finally disbanding, they recorded one last single for RCA under the name Common Market (RCA 47-9302). The tracks were the Cat Stevens- penned \\"I Love My Dog\\" backed with Tim Buckley's \\"Wings\\". Later years In April 2008, Sundazed Records released a CD with eighteen of the group's RCA recordings, which were remastered and packaged as The Best of the Liverpool Five (SC11158). In 2010, the group got together for a long awaited reunion concert in Sacramento, California in order to celebrate the 70th birthday of lead singer Steve Laine. Dennis Moffett joined the band on drums for the first reunion. In 2016, a second reunion concert for the ages took place in Fairfield ,California. This time to celebrate the 70th birthday of the group's youngest member, guitarist Ken Cox. James Grayberg joined the band on drums for the second reunion.

A GO labels electricity from renewable sources to provide information to electricity customers on the source of their energy. Guarantees of origin are the only precisely defined instruments evidencing the origin of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.  Certificate  In operation, a GO is a green label or tracker that guarantees that one MWh of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. Guarantees of origin are traded. When a company buys guarantees of origin, as documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed, the guarantees of origin are cancelled in the electronic certificate registry. This single standardized instrument makes it possible to track ownership, verify claims and ensure that guarantees of origin are only sold once and that there is no double counting. In their most accomplished form, guarantees of origin are issued electronically for a controlled quantity of electricity generation (1 GO per MWh), traded and redeemed (i.e. used) by suppliers as evidence to their customers of the quality of the delivered electricity. Generation from renewable energy sources is the most sought-after attribute. A new development concerns guarantees of origin for cogeneration heat plants (or CHP). Some countries already have guarantees of origin issued for all types of electricity generation. AIB statistics from 2016 show that Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands are the largest markets for guarantees of origin in Europe. While Europe's biggest market, Germany, halted its rapid growth, the Dutch market continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, almost reaching 50 TWh in 2016. Guarantees of origin should not be confused with the Eugene Green Energy Standard or EKOenergy labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power (transparency). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Besides, Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas guarantees of origin arise from European regulations.see Directives 2001/77/EC, 2004/8/EC and logically 2003/54/EC, all applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA).  Governance  The GO is standardized through the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) provided by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). The European Energy Certificate System makes trade, cancellation and use of GOs standardized across AIB members.  Terminology   Production period  Refers to the month and year when the electricity was produced.  Issued  GOs created in a month for electricity produced in an earlier month.  Transfer  Transfer is the delivery process of GO from one party to another.  Import ‚Äì export  GOs can originate from another country than the country of consumption. GOs can be imported (exported) from another country either via import (export), or via cancellation.  Cancellation  Cancellation is analogous to physical 'use' of a GO certificate and is the method for allocating the attributes of the electricity to the single end- user. Cancelling a GO is the only way to redeem its benefits while ensuring that the certificate will not be traded, given, sold, or used by another end- user. Consumer information and avoidance of double counting is the main objective of this system.

John Carpenter the bishop was also known as John Carpenter the elder.This family had Flemish/Du Nord French ancestry in its names. Translations of Jean/Jehan/Jehannes become John in English. Jean & Jehan being the diminutive form became John the younger while some Jehan and all Jehannes became John the elder or rarely John the older. For more details see Jenkin. He had three siblings, Margery, John the younger, and William. His two brothers were baptised in Hereford.

A Master John Carpenter, then King's clerk, is referred to in Patent Rolls of 17 March 1433 and 9 July 1435, the first being a grant for life of the wardenship. John Carpenter, bishop of Worcester, appears as a plaintiff in the Plea Rolls of the Common Pleas, in 1450, and is also described as the warden of the Hospital of St Anthony.

Church at Westbury on Trym Carpenter was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Westbury on Trym in 1476. He had been baptised at the same church, which at that time was dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. Soon after Carpenter became bishop he sought to raise the status of St Peter's to that of a joint cathedral with Worcester, and styled himself \\"Bishop of Worcester and Westbury\\". He had the building rededicated to the Holy Trinity. Carpenter added a chancel, and a chapel dedicated to St Oswald, to the fabric. He also refounded and rebuilt Westbury College. Carpenter was buried in the crypt underneath the altar. His memorial was originally a cadaver tomb, with the bishop in full episcopal attire above an enclosure containing a sculpture of a cadaver or skeleton. This tomb was broken up in 1646, during the Civil War, by soldiers from the Bristol garrison. In 1851 the stone cadaver was found in the crypt of the chapel. This was incorporated in 1853 into a new canopied memorial of Purbeck marble, marked on top with a bishop's crozier. Over the porch entrance doorway is a statue of Bishop Carpenter, of unknown date. At some time headless, the statue was restored in the early 20th century. References Further reading * Powicke, F. Maurice and E. B. Fryde Handbook of British Chronology 2nd. ed.

Morton gained an MA from the University of Oxford in 1458, and was awarded an LLD by them in 1480 as a way for the university to honour his uncle. Morton received the benefice of All Saints', Huntington in 1458, and by the time he was elected to the episcopate in 1486 he was also the Prebendary of St Paul's, Salisbury, York, Beverley, and Wherwell Abbey, as well as the archdeacon of Gloucester and of Winchester. On 9 January 1479 Morton became Master of the Rolls, losing it on 22 September 1483 when his uncle opposed Richard III of England. Morton also played a part in the campaign against Richard, and was with Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth. After Henry became king, Morton was again made Master of the Rolls on 13 November 1485.

On 15 March 1497, he received a pardon from Henry VII, which was intended to secure his property against extortions. He was the last English Bishop of Worcester before the English Reformation, with his successors being Italian, and served until his death in May 1497. He was buried in Old St Paul's Cathedral rather than his own Worcester Cathedral. As a result, his grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. His name is now listed on a monument in the crypt giving the names of important graves lost. Due to the large absence of material on his life from 1458 to 1477, where Morton is recorded receiving a papal dispensation, he is sometimes considered to be the same man as Robert Morton, a composer who lived at around the same time.

It is traditionally considered a seasonal food, consumed most often in summer. Its name comes from the fact that the noodles are not extruded or spun, but cut. Kalguksu at Doosan Encyclopedia  History  The record of noodles can be found in documents of the Goryeo era, but the descriptions are vague and the nature of the noodles isn't clear. In the 12th century document Goryeo dogyeong (; Hanja: È´òÈ∫óÂúñÁ∂ì) it is mentioned that noodles were only eaten on special occasions, as wheat flour was very expensive, being imported from China. A cooking description can be found in a later document, The Best New Cooking Methods of Joseon (; Hanja: ÊúùÈÆÆÁÑ°ÈõôÊñ∞ÂºèÊñôÁêÜË£ΩÊ≥ï), written in 1924. In the 1934 book Simple Joseon Cooking, the recipe calls for the noodles to be boiled and rinsed in cold water before adding broth and garnish, a method that differs from the modern version of boiling the noodles together with the broth. Kalguksu at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture  Preparation and serving  The noodles are made with dough from wheat flour and eggs, and sometimes ground bean powder is added for texture. The dough is let to breathe, then rolled out thinly and cut in long strips. The broth for kalguksu is usually made with dried anchovies, shellfish, and kelp. Sometimes chicken broth would be used. In order to obtain a rich flavor, the ingredients are simmered for many hours. The noodles and various vegetables, most often Korean zucchini, potatoes, and scallions are added and boiled together. Usually seasoned with salt, the noodles are served with garnish of choice.

Francis Bingham Mildmay, 1st Baron Mildmay of Flete, TD, DL (26 April 1861 ‚Äì 8 February 1947) was initially a Liberal and later a Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 until 1922 when he was raised to the peerage. Mildmay was the son of Henry Bingham Mildmay and his wife, Georgiana Frances (n√©e Bulteel). He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a partner in the firm of Baring Brothers.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 At the 1885 general election, Mildmay was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Totnes division of Devon. He was one of the Liberal Unionists who combined to oppose the Home Rule Bill in 1885, and was returned in subsequent parliaments as a Liberal Unionist, and from 1912 as a Conservative. He held the seat for 37 years until he retired from the Commons at the 1922 general election and was ennobled. Mildmay held a commission in the West Kent Yeomanry (Queen's Own), a cavalry Yeomanry regiment, where he was first lieutenant, promoted to captain on 17 May 1893, and to major on 20 March 1901. He saw active service in the Second Boer War when he volunteered for the Imperial Yeomanry, where he was appointed a lieutenant in the 11th battalion on 10 February 1900, leaving Liverpool for South Africa on the SS Cymric in March 1900. After the war had ended, he returned to a commission in the West Kent Yeomanry in August 1902. He later served in World War I between 1914 and 1918. At one stage he was divisional interpreter of General Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow, who referred to him with affection and some wonderment at his tireless work and bravery in doing his duty at the Second Battle of Ypres. Mildmay was often found to be carrying messages across the battlefield. Snow described him as a colourful and brave chap and recommended him for a decoration more than once though he never got one apart from the Territorial Decoration (TD). GWR 'Bulldog' class 3417 Lord Mildmay of Flete (named in 1923) Mildmay was created Baron Mildmay of Flete, of Totnes in the County of Devon, on the 20 November 1922 and was a member of the Committee for Review of Political Honours Commission between 1923 and 1924. Appointed a deputy lieutenant of Devon on 31 March 1913, he became Lord- Lieutenant of Devon in 1928. He lived at Flete House, a mansion near Plymouth built by his father which remodelled and extended the original house of the Elizabethan era. He was an extensive breeder and exhibitor of South Devon Cattle and was President of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1932 and from 1941‚Äì43. He was a member and treasurer of the Medical Research Council and a director of the Great Western Railway, who named 'Bulldog' class locomotive 3417 after him. Family Mildmay married Alice O. St. J. Grenfell, daughter of Charles Seymour Grenfell, in 1906. They had two children: a son, Anthony, and a daughter.

It describes the many pitfalls that teams face as they seek to \\"grow together\\". This book explores the fundamental causes of organizational politics and team failure. Like most of Lencioni's books, the bulk of it is written as a business fable. This book has appeared on American best-seller lists including: The New York Times Best Seller List, Business Week, Wall Street Journal and USA Today. The issues it describes were considered especially important to team sports. The book's lessons were applied by several coaches to their teams in the National Football League in the United States. Summary According to the book, the five dysfunctions are: * Absence of trust‚Äîunwilling to be vulnerable within the group * Fear of conflict‚Äîseeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate * Lack of commitment‚Äîfeigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization * Avoidance of accountability‚Äîducking the responsibility to call peers, superiors on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards * Inattention to results‚Äîfocusing on personal success, status and ego before team success Characters * Kathryn Petersen, newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of fictional company DecisionTech, Inc. * Jeff Shanley, Former CEO, Cofounder, Head of Business Development. * Michele (Mikey) Bebe, Head of Marketing. * Martin Gilmore, Chief Technologist. * Jeff (JR) Rawlins, Head of Sales. * Carlos Amador, Head of Customer Support. * Jan Mersino, Chief Financial Officer. * Nick Farrell, Chief Operating Officer.

While they clearly emphasize The Five Dysfunctions of a Team's contributions to the field they also point out major drawbacks of the model: \\"Lencioni's model provides useful insights about team dynamics and has some advantages over the other models. The model is straightforward, identifies many of the reasons why teams fail, and offers practical advice on how to build high- functioning teams. Lencioni also deserves credit for pointing out the following: # The importance of the \\"first team\\". # The need for leaders to teach teams how to win. # The recognition of time wasted avoiding conflict. # Cascading effect of leadership team dynamics. The simplicity of the Five Dysfunctions model and key insights make it popular among human resource professionals and team consultants. Nonetheless, Lencioni's book is explicitly a work of fiction; it is not based on research and its practical recommendations lack empirical support. For example, when the trust level among team members is low, Lencioni recommends that leaders put them through a series of personal disclosures. However, there is little likelihood that these activities can build trust in dysfunctional work teams. According to Katzenbach and Smith, the only effective method for teams to build trust and cohesion is to do real work, and using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the results do not constitute real work. Similar problems afflict the four other dysfunctions.\\" References External links * The Patrick Lencioni Homepage Category:Business books Category:Teams ","title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"},{"id":"13133112","text":"Schizomeris is a genus of green algae in the family Schizomeridaceae.See the NCBI webpage on Schizomeris.

His works include landscapes, winter landscapes, marine and seascapes, still life fruit and fowl.Pastel Masters: Chandler Chandler was born in New York City. He was raised by deeply religious parents of the Christian faith. This would influence him his entire life, as he was not only known for his art, but also as a great humanitarian. Chandler's first job was in Chicago as a carver of cameos. While in Chicago, he married and he and his wife had three daughters. His wife and youngest daughter died early in his marriage. Upon their deaths, Chandler moved to New Jersey, so that his sister could help care for his two surviving daughters. After moving to New Jersey in 1887, Chandler and his brother started the William Henry Chandler Company in New York City. It was at this company that Chandler would produce his artworks that he is known for today. His brother was put in charge of the framing, packing and selling of the works. His art was sold through stores nationwide, including Marshall Fields and The May Company. He worked in pastels, that he imported from France. At his company, he employed 20 other artists, who also worked on pastel paintings. His work was exhibited at the International Exposition in Paris in 1900‚Äì1901. He was greatly influenced by the Hudson River School of Art. In turn, it is said that his work influenced other artists, such as Maxfield Parrish. Chandler was a popular artist in his own time. His style was frequently copied by other artists of the era. His original works were mass- produced as prints and lithographs by such publishing houses as Taber-Prang, Hallen and Weiner (NY), Joseph Hoover (Philadelphia), and Mueller and Lucksinger Co. (NY). Chandler died on February 26, 1928 and was buried at the Rosedale Cemetery in Orange, New Jersey.

In June 2003, JD Edwards arranged to be purchased by PeopleSoft for $1.8 billion. Oracle, within days, launched a hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft with intent to exclude JD Edwards. PeopleSoft went ahead with the purchase of JD Edwards anyway, and in 2005, Oracle finally acquired the combined JD Edwards-PeopleSoft organization, bringing the JD Edwards WorldSoftware and EnterpriseOne product lines into the product portfolio of Oracle Corporation. Early Life McVaney was born in Omaha, Nebraska, December 29, 1940. As his father was off to war as a World War II dentist, according to a 2002 interview, McVaney had very little memory of him until he came home at the end of the War. His father had graduated from Creighton University and while he served largely behind lines in the Army Air Corps, he came home from Europe with indications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and was haunted by nightmares and terrified by loud noises for many years after his return. McVaney recalls the day his father showed up saying that of him that he appeared to be \\"the biggest, tallest man in the whole world. I was just a little squirt\\". McVaney's siblings included four brothers. His mother Mary McVaney, was a housewife and as a child, the family lived, as he describes it, \\"in a very frugal, frugal way\\" in their home on 38th Street in Omaha, Nebraska. Education McVaney attended a Jesuit elementary prep school, and graduated high school, Creighton Prep School, in 1959. He then went to Iowa State Teacher's College (now the University of Northern Iowa) on a football scholarship. He was on the dean's list and graduated with honors in 1964 with a BS in mechanical engineering. Discovered making \\"free calls\\" with little wire device to his girlfriend, Carole, in Lincoln, Nebraska, McVaney lost his football scholarship and left Iowa State Teacher's College. He returned to Creighton Prep School for a semester-and-a-half, and then attended the University of Nebraska. McVaney married Carole in 1963 For post-graduate training, McVaney attended Rutgers University. McVaney and his wife lived in Cedar Grove, New Jersey.C. EDWARD MCVANEY: Oral History , Computerworld Honors Program. Accessed July 6, 2011. \\"We moved back east and lived in Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\\" Career Upon his graduation from Rutgers, McVaney was hired by Western Electric as an operations research engineer. McVaney was transferred by Peat Marwick from New York City to Denver, Colorado in 1968. He continued with Marwick until 1970 when he took a position with Alexander Grant, now Grant Thornton LLP. JD Edwards founded Along with co-workers, Dan Gregory and Jack Thompson, McVaney founded JD Edwards in 1977. Family life Mr. McVaney was married for 57 years to his wife Carole, having met in high school and married in 1963. They had three children, as well as nine grandchildren. Philanthropy In May 1998, McVaney donated more than $32 million to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to establish the JD Edwards Honors Program (now the Jeffrey S. Raikes School). This program is charged with educating the next generation of business professionals by combining computer science education with business management skills.

It was often confused with the Rh system, not becoming a separate antigen system until 1982. The LW and RhD antigens are genetically independent though they are phenotypically related and the LW antigen is expressed more strongly on RhD positive cells than on RhD negative cells. In most populations, the antithetical LW antigens, LWa and LWb are present as very high and very low frequency, respectively. Genomics The LW locus is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.3). Molecular biology LW antigens reside on a 40- to 42-kiloDalton red cell membrane glycoprotein named CD242. The LW glycoprotein has recently been renamed ICAM-4 due to its similarity to intercellular adhesion molecule, although exactly which integrins bind to ICAM-4 is subject to controversy. The function of ICAM-4 is not fully understood but appears to be restricted to erythroid cells. During in vitro erythropoesis, LW appears at either the erythroid colony forming stage or later at the proerythroblast stage. A vital part of erythropoesis is the clustering of erythroblasts around bone marrow macrophages to form erythroblastic islands. The erythroblast is then able to remove its nucleus, which is in turn ingested and broken down by the macrophages, to become a mature erythrocyte. During this process ICAM-4 binds to VLA-4, an erythroblast binding site, on adjacent erythroblasts and to Œ±v integrins on macrophages to help stabilise the erythroblastic islands. The binding of red cells to macrophages in the spleen by ICAM-4 could also play a part in the removal of senescent red cells. Despite the functional aspects of ICAM-4, its apparent absence in LW(a-b-) and Rhnull phenotypes does not appear to lead to any obvious pathological effects. ICAM-4 expression is elevated on sickle red cells and its binding to Œ±v integrins on the endothelial cells may cause the pain associated with sickle cell crises. Auto anti-LW is not uncommon as an autoantibody but usually presents with transient suppression of the LW antigen in genetically LW+ individuals, and so appears to be an alloantibody. True alloanti-LW is a very rare occurrence, with only two known examples of alloanti-LWab, produced by patients with an LW(a-b-) phenotype. Anti-LW can be present as a clinically insignificant autoantibody and not be associated with increased red cell destruction. Anti-LW has also been associated with cases of warm type autoimmune haemolytic anaemia; Philip Levine suggested that it was the most common antibody in cases of AIHA with a positive Coombs test. Transfusion medicine Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDFN) due to alloanti-LW is described as mild and very rare, even the very potent anti-LWab of one known patient caused minimal evidence of HDFN in her three pregnancies. To date auto anti-LW has only been implicated as the cause of one case of HDFN.

As Austria was at war and Vienna occupied by Napoleon's troops, a rather simple funeral was held in Gumpendorf, the parish in Vienna to which Haydn's house on the Windm√ºhle belonged, followed by burial in the Hundsturm cemetery. Following the burial, two men contrived to bribe the gravedigger and thereby sever and steal the dead composer's head. These were Joseph Carl Rosenbaum, a former secretary of the Esterh√°zy family (Haydn's employers), and Johann Nepomuk Peter, governor of the provincial prison of Lower Austria. Rosenbaum was well known to Haydn, who during his lifetime had intervened with the Esterh√°zys in an attempt to make possible Rosenbaum's marriage to the soprano Therese Gassmann.The marriage did ultimately take place in 1800, after Rosenbaum had left Esterh√°zy employment. A 19th century phrenological chart Peter and Rosenbaum's motivation was an interest in phrenology, a now- discredited scientific movement that attempted to associate mental capacities with aspects of cranial anatomy; Peter and Rosenbaum were acquainted with and admired the work of Franz Joseph Gall, a leading phrenologist. Of particular interest to phrenology was the anatomy of individuals held to have exhibited great genius during their lifetime. (Eighteen years later, a similar attempt was made on the body of Ludwig van Beethoven, possibly for similar reasons.)According to Beethoven's biographer, Anton Schindler, the gravedigger told him that he had turned down a bribe of 1000 florins for delivering the great composer's severed head. The head was stolen by the gravedigger (whose name was Jakob Demuth) only on June 4, and due to hot weather the head had decomposed considerably, causing Rosenbaum to throw up as he delivered it in a carriage to the hospital for dissection. According to Landon, \\"after an examination of an hour the head was macerated and the skull bleached.\\" Peter concluded that \\"the bump of music\\" in Haydn's skull was indeed \\"fully developed\\". In September, the skull was installed in Peter's collection at his home, where it could be shown to visitors. Peter kept it in a handsome custom- made black wooden box, with a symbolic golden lyre at the top, glass windows, and a white cushion. At some point in the ensuing decade, Peter gave up his skull collection and let Rosenbaum have, among others, the Haydn skull. In 1820, Haydn's old patron Prince Nikolaus Esterh√°zy II was inadvertently reminded by the chance remark of an acquaintance that he had forgotten to carry through his plan of having Haydn's remains transferred from Gumpendorf to the family seat in Eisenstadt.Specifically, to the Esterh√°zy family crypt in the Bergkirche. When the remains were exhumed, the Prince was furious to find that they included no skull, and quickly deduced that Peter and Rosenbaum were responsible. However, through a series of devious maneuvers Peter and Rosenbaum managed to maintain possession of the skull. Rosenbaum hid the skull in a straw mattress. During the search of Rosenbaum's house, his wife Therese lay on the bed and claimed to be menstruating‚Äîwith the result that the searchers did not go near the mattress.Hunting Haydn's Head, BBC Radio 4 broadcast by Simon Townley, 30 May 2009 Eventually Rosenbaum gave Prince Esterh√°zy a different skull. Haydn's tomb in the Bergkirche, Eisenstadt After Rosenbaum's death in 1829 the skull passed from hand to hand. Rosenbaum had willed the skull to Peter, who gave it to his physician Karl Heller, from whom it went to a Professor Rokitansky, who in 1895 gave it to the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of the Friends of Music). The musicologist Karl Geiringer, who worked at the Society before the advent of Hitler, would on occasion proudly bring out the relic and show it to visitors. In 1932, Prince Paul Esterh√°zy, Nikolaus's descendant, built a marble tomb for Haydn in the Bergkirche in Eisenstadt. This was a suitable location, since it is where some of the masses Haydn wrote for the Esterh√°zy family were premiered. The Prince's express purpose was to unify the composer's remains. However, there were many further delays, and it was only in 1954 that the skull could be transferred, in a splendid ceremony, from the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde to this tomb, thus completing the 145-year-long burial process. When the composer's skull was finally restored to the remainder of his skeleton, the substitute skull was not removed. Thus Haydn's tomb now contains two skulls.

Species of Tetraspora are unicellular green algae that exist in arrangements of four and consist of cells being packaged together in a gelatinous envelope that creates macroscopic colonies. These are primarily freshwater organisms, although there have been few cases where they have been found inhabiting marine environments and even contaminated water bodies. Tetraspora species can be found all around the globe, with the exception of Antarctica. Despite the ubiquitous presence, greatest growth of the genera's species is seen in the polar climatic zones. Tetraspora species are non-motile and instead of having flagella, they possess pairs of pseudoflagella which are part of the pseudociliary apparatus. On average the cell diameter of Tetraspora ranges from 6-13 Œºm. Energy is accumulated via photosynthesis through two cup-shaped chloroplasts, making the species primary producers. Blooms have been noted in contaminated environments due to excess augmentation of ammonia from industrial waste and are now being associated with the drop in biodiversity in such water bodies. Both sexual and asexual reproduction are possible for species within this genus. In addition, mitosis is well defined in Tetraspora species; particularly investigated in T. gelatinosa. Cell division involves elaborate arrangement of microtubules, basal body complexes and involve the use of structures like phycoplasts and protoplast. Studies have shown antimicrobial properties of certain species. In addition, Tetraspora is an important photobiological hydrogen producers and therefore is intensively being looked at for biofuel purposes. , thirty species have been classified into this genus. Etymology The genus name Tetraspora is derived from the word tetrad; which refers to the confirmation of four. Tetra is Greek for four and spora is Latin for cells, thus describing species of this genus as existing in groups of four. History The genus Tetraspora was first described by Link ex Desvaux in the year 1818, where the purpose for the genus was to organize algae with spores arranged in confirmations of tetrads. In the very first classifications, species of Tetraspora were classified into the order Tetrasporales under Chlorophyta. However, with molecular analysis, it was found that Tetraspora species had similar basal body morphology to Chlamydomonas and also had molecular similarity in the SSU rDNA. This changed the classification from being under the order Tetrasporales to order Volvocales, where they still reside today. Habitat Tetraspora species are primarily freshwater organisms which inhabit ecosystems like streams, lakes, rivers, ponds. They can be found in harsh environments like thermal effluents and industrial waste. However, just recently it has been found that Tetraspora species have the ability to adapt and reside in marine environments that are exceptionally nutrient rich and receive freshwater river outflows. Species have been found in both stagnant and free flowing water bodies, although morphology of species between the two water types slightly differs. Physio-chemical studies of the habitats have shown that Tetraspora species tolerate wide pH ranges: (4.5-9.63) but are most commonly found in water bodies with a pH between 6-7. Likewise, the optimal growth conditions for species of the genus Tetraspora are alkaline, low mesotrophic and shallow bodies of freshwater. Interestingly, species have also shown to be most abundant and well established on the beds of slow-flowing streams and rivers; where they generally take on the form of thin filamentous macroscopic colonies. Tetraspora species are found on every continent, with the exception of Antarctica, and can be located at all latitudes. Therefore, they are found in all climatic zones: polar, tropics, warm and cool temperate zones and the equatorial zones. While they can be present in all climatic zones, the most optimal zones are cool temperate and the polar zones. This is because of the species preferring cold water to warm. Ecology Like most other green algae, Tetraspora also is photoautotrophic. Their ability to conduct photosynthesis, establishes them at the starting point of aquatic food chains and food webs. Tetraspora function as primary producers and hence are responsible for capturing and assimilating the energy that will be passed down subsequent trophic levels. In water bodies associated with sewage waste, industrial waste and fishery waste, Tetraspora blooms have been documented. Spewing of sewage, industrial and fishery wastes leads to anthropogenic eutrophication, where there is excess augmentation of ammonia; a principal nitrogen source for certain species of Tetraspora. The excess nitrogen is proposed to contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation of Tetraspora colonies; resulting in algal blooms. Tetraspora blooms have negative effects on the overall environmental ecology because they shift and alter the chemical properties of the water. This is because with the mass growth, hypoxia and/or anoxia can occur and these may have detrimental effects on biodiversity and survivability of other organisms such as fish. Morphology Species of the genus Tetraspora are unicellular green algae, in which the individual cells are non-motile and are shaped spherically or elliptically. These individual cells are arranged in sets or multiples of four; these could be in the arrangement of four-by-four cells or two-by-two. All cells are encased within a macroscopic mucilaginous matrix, that creates macroscopic colonies. Within the envelope, the cells are uniformly distributed and overall, the mucilaginous envelope creates an irregular outline with asymmetrical shapes and edges. The size of cells has been found to vary based on the type of Tetraspora species and the type of climatic zone the species is found in. On average the diameter of species in the genus Tetraspora ranges from 6-13 Œºm, with the species in the tropics usually being the smallest (6-9 Œºm), followed by the temperate zone species (6-14 Œºm), and the polar species (7.5-13 Œºm). The difference in cell size therefore also impacts sizes of the colonies, but sizes of colonies also vary with whether the cells are residing in stagnant or flowing water. In stagnant water, colonies may range from 5‚Äì10 cm in length, while in flowing water, colonies may reach lengths up to 50 cm. In addition to impacting colony size, the type of water (stagnant or free flowing) also impacts the morphology of the colonies. Most macroscopic colonies of Tetraspora are cylindrical in nature, but in stagnant water colonies may appear as short sacs and clubs with thalli that resemble balloons. Flowing water colonies on the other hand, tend to form narrow cylindrical structures with the thalli also being more or less cylindrical and sometimes can be lightly rounded at the sheaths. Cellular structures/anatomy Species in the genus Tetraspora contain two pseduoflagella as a part of the pseudociliary apparatus, two cup-shaped chloroplasts with chlorophyll A and B pigments, a single pyrenoid and contractile vacuoles located inside the cytoplasm. Additionally, starch grains can be seen covering the pyrenoid and the walls of the cells are noted to be thin. Tetraspora species do not possess a flagellum of the 9+2 microtubular fibre configuration, instead they have pseudoflagellum with a 9+0 fibre confirmation; where the central two tubular fibres are absent. There are two pseduoflagelulla that exist in a pair and both protrude from the anterior region of the cell and into the gelatinous matrix. Additionally, it has been found that the pseudoflagella are longer than the actual cells. The pseudoflagella is part of the pseudociliary apparatus, which consists of a cytoplasmic microtubule system, striated fibre system, basal bodies, and the pseudoflagella themselves. Pseudoflagella each display a striped pattern, where they are seen to regularly have striped structures of light and dark sections of equal length. On average, the length of pseudoflagella is from 70-120 Œºm long and 0.70-1.60 Œºm wide, but they can get up to 155 Œºm in length. Life cycle Reproduction in the genus Tetraspora can be both sexual and asexual. Sexual reproduction occurs through isogamous means, but occasionally depending on the species, it can also be isogamous or oogamous. Asexual division in Tetraspora occurs via mitotic division; the products can be two or four uninucleate daughter cells. In addition to vegetative cells, asexual reproduction can also produce zoospores, which may act as autospores ranging from two to eight per cell. When living conditions become less favourable, many species of the genus Tetraspora also have the ability to form into hypanospores called akineties. Akineties are thick-walled spores that are brown in colour with a diameter of 12.9-15.80 Œºm and a cell wall thickness of 0.6-1.10 Œºm. They function as resting cells which are resistant to cold temperatures and desiccation. The process of division of mature akineties is done by amoeboid protoplasts located inside the mucilaginous envelopes. Cell division in Tetraspora species has been described. It is noted that prior to mitosis beginning, cells become immotile and the basal bodies located at the surface of cells start to retreat in. This causes the preprophase nucleus to migrate toward retreating basal body complex, around which microtubules start to gather. The basal body complex arranges itself to be closely associated with one pole of the cell, creating a mitotic spindle known as open polar fenestrae. Furthermore, it is speculated that the spindle itself may also be unicentric. Eventually, microtubules extend from the spindle, and during anaphase, they penetrate through the fenestrae and split the nucleus. Subsequently to telophase, the nucleus reforms, but a phycoplast forms. In addition, a protoplast is found inside the cell wall and is noted to rotate within the wall during cleavage; a process known to occur by the cell undergoing furrowing. Practical importance Phytotoxic and cytotoxic activity analysis of some Tetraspora species displayed antibiotic activities against specific fungal and bacterial species, meaning that Tetraspora species may help develop or compose antibiotics. In addition, species of Tetraspora are known to be high hydrogen producing organisms. This is significant because hydrogen gas is considered a promising clean fuel. This means that Tetraspora species may potentially act as photobiological hydrogen producers and green biofuels.

Trebouxia is a paraphyletic group.Friedl, T., & Zeltner, C. (1994).

The presence of globose cells in fossil lichens from the Lower Devonian period (415 million years ago) that look similar to Trebouxia indicate the significance of Trebouxia fungi symbiosis throughout the history of Earth. History of knowledge The genus Trebouxia was initially described by Puymaly in 1924.Puymaly, A. D. (1924). Le Chlorococcum humicola (Nag.) Rabenh. Revue Algologique, 1, 107-114 The genus was divided into two genera Trebouxia and Pseudotrebouxia.Nash, T. H., III. (1996). Lichen biology. Cambridge;New York, NY, USA;: Cambridge University Press Some recent studies imply that the differences between two groups are invalid and the genus should be divided in different ways such as splitting Trebouxia into two genera, Asterochloris (including photobionts of suborder Cladoniinae) and Trebouxia (including photoboints of suborder Lecanorineae). Furthermore, Trebouxia‚Äôs systematic location and taxonomy has been uncertain for decades. Initially, in 1995, the group was placed in the order Pleurastrales Hoek, C. v. d., Mann, D. G., & Jahns, H. M. (1995). Algae: An introduction to phycology. Cambridge;New York;: Cambridge University Press and then in Microthamniales. Later in 2002, it was part of the order Chlorococcales and now it is placed in the order Trebouxiales. It is unknown whether all photobionts described as ‚Äútrebouxioid‚Äù belong to a single genus. Also, it is also unclear how many and which species should be accepted and recognized. Furthermore, in earlier years, classification and nomenclature of species was based on organism‚Äôs color, size, growth and shape of colonies, texture, and the lichen it was isolated from. It was believed that each algae species belonged to a specific lichen species. However, in recent years, each Trebouxia species has been treated independently from lichen species since the same species of Trebouxia can be associated with many lichens. Now, the classification and nomenclature of species is based on pyrenoid structure, electron dense vesicles, chloroplast and grana shape, vegetative cell size and thickness of cell wall.Casano, L.

It can be found in the tropics, Arctic, Antarctic, boreal forest, fresh water, marine, bare rocks, wood debris, tree bark, sandstone, soil, hot and semi-arid deserts.Anderson, O. R. (2014).

Journal of Phycology,29(4), 427-434. doi:10.1111/j.1529-8817.1993.tb00143.x Furthermore, Trebouxia can exist in its free-living form or in a lichen thallus as a photobiont partner with its fungi mycobiont. The release or escape of alga zoospores from intact lichens is a source of free-living algae colonies or single free-living cells. Moreover, the same Trebouxia species can be associated with many mycobiont species or many Trebouxia strains can inhibit single lichen.Catal√°, S., Campo, E. M., Barreno, E., Garc√≠a-Breijo, F.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,94, 765-777. doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2015.10.021 However, the maturation of the lichen could lead to the elimination of all Trebouxia strains except one. Also, Trebouxia species are not selective towards their fungal symbionts while fungal species are very selective regarding their algae partners. In areas where algae species are scarce, fungi are less selective and forms a symbiotic relationship with any Trebouxia species and later on switch to a more suitable algae species. Some Trebouxia species are highly dependent on their fungal partners and cannot exist as independent organisms.Rikkinen, J. (1995). Whats behind the pretty colours? A study on the photobiology of lichens. Helsinki: Finish Biological SocietyRikkinen, J. (2002). Cyanolichens: An Evolutionary Overview.Dordrecht: Springer. doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-48005-0_4 Fungi obtain nutrients through self parasitism or selectively harvesting old Trebouxia cells. Trebouxia, on the other hand, provides 90% of its photosynthetic products to the mycoboint. Pyrenoglobuli (lipid rich stores in the pyrenoid of Trebouxia) are used by the mycoboint for energy and water. Trebouxia acts as an important primary producer in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. Trebouxia uses carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b to harvest energy from the sun and synthesize organic compounds that serve as a substantial food source for a wide range of heterotrophs including animals, invertebrates and insects. Description of the organism Morphology Trebouxia is a unicellular spherical green alga that contains a star-like (stellate) or aggregated chloroplast with a single pyrenoid (aggregation of enzymes) at the centre. The size of cells can range from 8- 21 um in length.≈†kaloud, P. (2008). Trebouxia potteri. Retrieved from https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/skaloud/Treb/Trepot.htm Trebouxia is divided into two groups based on shape of vegetative cells and nature of chromatophore. In the first group, chromatophores are located in the parietal position during the cell division and are deeply incised with irregular, narrow processes that extend to the cell wall and compress against it. The shape of vegetative cells is ellipsoidal in group 1. In group 2, chromatophores are smooth-margined structures located in a central position during the cell division and are not compressed against the cell wall. The vegetative cells are spherical in group 2. All Trebouxia associated with lichen possess lipid-rich globules in their pyrenoids known as pyrenoglobuli.McCoy, A. G. (1977). Nutritional, morphological, and physiological characteristics of Trentepohlia (I.U. 1227) in axenic culture on defined media. Retrieved from https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/44218 Pyrenoglobuli are used by fungi in the lichen thallus for energy and as a water source. Trebouxia phycobionts possess different amounts and types of pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids in different environmental conditions. For instance, Antarctic Trebouxia contains low chlorophyll a, high chlorophyll b, and diverse carotenoids compared to Mid-European Trebouxia phycobionts due to the low-temperature fluorescence spectra in Antarctica. Reproduction and life cycle Reproduction in Trebouxia is mediated by autospores and zoospores. Autospores are non-motile spores that have the same shape as their parent cells. They are produced inside the parent cells. Zoospores are motile spores that are produced inside the lichen thalli and released. They are similar in structure and size in all Trebouxia taxa. They are 4-6 um in size and do not possess a cell wall. This allows them to change shape and fit into the fungal network. Later in development, they round up to form walls and become vegetative cells. The zoospores are flattened cells that contain a cup- shaped green chromatophore and two flagella of equal length arising from the basal body and extending beyond the length of body. They contain one contractile vacuole, nucleus, dictyosome, chloroplast, and single mitochondrial reticulum or branched mitochondria linked to microbody. Some species have a stigma (eyespots) which helps orient zoospores towards high light intensity. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. One type connects to two basal bodies and one nucleus. The other type attaches to left and right plasma membrane at cell surfaces. The cell division of Trebouxia occurs by the cleavage of the chromatophore into two equal halves followed by the pyrenoid division. The pyrenoid can either divide by simple constriction or it can disappear during the division of the chromatophore as observed during zoosporogenesis. In some cells, the nucleus divides before the second division of chromatophore halves whereas in other cells it divides after the second division of the chromatophore by migrating to centre of cell between chromatophore halves. The detail of cell division is understudied and more research needs to be conducted. Trebouxia has a complex life cycle. The details of the life cycle are not properly understood and more research is required. Reproduction in Trebouxia can occur by zoospores or autospores. Zoospores are flagellated motile stages within lichens that migrate and settle near fungal spores when liquid water is present.Archibald, P. A. (1975). Trebouxia de Pulmaly (Chlorophyceae, Chlorococcales) and Pseudotrebouxia gen. nov. (Chlorophyceae, Chlorosarcinales). Phycologia,14(3), 125-137. doi:10.2216/i0031-8884-14-3-125.1Tschermak-Woess, E. (1989). Developmental studies in trebouxioid algae and taxonomical consequences. Plant Systematics and Evolution,164(1-4), 161-195. doi:10.1007/bf00940436 The clustering of zoospores around fungal spores can lead to the secretion of an attractant that induces zoospores settlement.Ahmadjian, V. (1967). A Guide to the Algae Occurring as Lichen Symbionts: Isolation, Culture, Cultural Physiology, and Identification. Phycologia,6(2-3), 127-160. doi:10.2216/i0031-8884-6-2-127.1 Once the zoospores settle, they change shape and round up to fit into the fungal network. The first cell division after zoospore settlement can either result in the formation of zoosporangium/ autosporagium with 4 to 32 adhering autospore packages (tetrads) or into differentiated vegetative cells. These differentiated vegetative cells are later transformed into zoosporangium/ autosporangia with numerous small autospores, but without adhering packages or tetrad formation. The formation of autospores can occur in two ways. The first way is in which species with permanent aplanosporic (autospore) state arrest the development of zoospores. The division of the chloroplast is accompanied by rounding off and developing a cell wall. In the second way, polygonal- like divisions of the chloroplast form reproductive daughter cells with the cell walls independent of parent cells. The production of aplanospores (autospores) in the second way leads to the development of 16-32 spores in the sporangium. For many years, no sexual structures or observation of sexual reproduction in Trebouxia were observed.Friedl, T., & Rokitta, C. (1997). Species relationships in the lichen alga Trebouxia (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae): molecular phylogenetic analyses of nuclear-encoded large subunit rRNA gene sequences. Symbiosis, Philadelphia, Pa.(USA) However, in recent years, through molecular methods, evidence of recombination and sexual fusions of gamates of the same size suggests the occurrence of sexual reproduction. The zygotes, quite distinct from zoospores, are 6.6 um in diameter and smooth walled with two round chloroplasts. First, the gametes pair up and fuse with each other, leading to the formation of zygotes. Then, the flagella disappear and the zygote develops in a normal vegetative pattern. Initially, it was thought that the fungus suppresses sexual reproduction in Trebouxia to inhibit the formation of novel genotypes that could be less suitable for symbiosis. However, it has recently been proposed that Trebouxia are more likely to reproduce sexually in lichen thallus. Furthermore, gametes from different Trebouxia species can escape the thallus and fuse to form hybrids or divide asexually to form micro colonies that can later be lichenized by fungi spores. Additional evidence of viable fungi spores and Trebouxia spores in fecal matter of lichen eating mites provides insight into short and long distance dispersal modes.Meier, F. A., Scherrer, S., & Honegger, R. (2002). Faecal pellets of lichenivorous mites contain viable cells of the lichen-forming ascomycete Xanthoria parietina and its green algal photobiont, Trebouxia arboricola. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,76(2), 259-268. doi:10.1046/j.1095-8312.2002.00065.x Genetics The symbiosis between Trebouxia and fungi resulted in three horizontal gene transfer events of protein encoding genes from the fungus genome to the Trebouxia genome. Within lichen, horizontal gene transfer can also occur among photobionts. The horizontal gene transfer events of introns among different Trebouxia species have been documented. Many introns can self splice or reverse the splicing reaction or gain motility at DNA or RNA levels that can mediate the transfer process. It is suggested that intron horizontal gene transfer occurs upon the direct cell to cell contact of different Trebouxia strains in immature lichen thallus. When a lichen thallus matures, only one strain of Trebouxia remains while others are eliminated. Viruses that infect Trebouxia and fungi also aid in horizontal gene transfer among different phycobiont species. Furthermore, different techniques have been developed to identify different Trebouxia strains within lichen thalli. ITS rDNA (internal transcribed spacer regions recombinant DNA) sequence comparisons with the aid of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are easy and fast ways to identify different Trebouxia species that inhabit a thallus. Fossil history It is known that the most widespread photobiont in extant lichens is Trebouxia. The fossil lichens from the Lower Devonian (415 million years ago) are composed of algae or cyanobacteria and fungi layers. Through the analysis of scanning electron microscopy, the globose structure of photobionts in Chlorolichenomycites salopensis lichen species during the Lower Devonian looks similar to Trebouxia species. Practical importance One of the first organisms to colonize terrestrial habitats were lichens. Lichens, along with few other organisms, introduced nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis into terrestrial environments approximately 450 million years ago. They played a significant role in making the harsh terrestrial environment suitable for the colonization of other organisms such as land plants, animals, and insects. Even today lichens make many unsuitable extreme habitats more suitable for species to colonize and survive. Lichens increase the amount of organic matter and organic nitrogen in the soil by producing organic acid that increases rock weathering. Furthermore, lichens are a critical bioindicators of habitat disturbances, freshwater quality, air pollution, carbon dioxide measures, and long term ecological continuity of undisturbed forests. Lichens are also used to date the divergence times of many extinct or extant species. Moreover, lichens are critical in climate change and global warming studies to understand the effects of increasing green house gasses such as carbon dioxide in natural environments. The position of Trebouxia at the base of the food chain as a primary producer is critical for the maintenance of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. Trebouxia algae commonly occur as symbionts in lichens, such as Xanthoria parietina.

The highway runs from its junction with SR 62 at its southern end between Wartburg and Coalfield in Morgan County, to its northern end at Caryville, Tennessee in Campbell County. Route description From its southwestern terminus it heads northeast and passes through the town of Petros and past Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary. Continuing northeast into Anderson County (along a mountain pass known locally as Petros Mountain), the highway then passes through remote mountainous country known for its many former coal mining villages, some of which were company towns and are now essentially ghost towns. Among them are the towns (or former towns) of Fork Mountain, Buffalo, Devonia (a/k/a Moore's Camp), Braytown, Rosedale, and Charley's Branch. The Devonia post office which served this entire region was closed in 1975. Once the mines in these towns closed down with the resulting loss of population, the towns' schools were closed and remaining students were consolidated into the Rosedale school, which saw steadily falling enrollment and was closed in the 1990s. This section of SR 116 parallels the New River and the former line of the Tennessee Railroad. There are many abandoned underground coal mines, coal tipples, and railroad yards and sidings along this section of SR 116. Despite the end of most underground mining and the demise of the towns along this portion of the highway, a great deal of strip mining continues however. SR 116 briefly passes into Campbell County and then turns southeast back into Anderson County. From there it passes through the village of Stainville (more commonly known as Ligias Fork) and continues southeast through some remote, sparsely populated mountains (along a very long and steep mountain pass locally known as Graves Gap) to Laurel Grove. There it turns northeast again at the junction with Frost Bottom Road, since 1982 designated as SR 330. This section of the highway parallels Walden Ridge to the immediate southeast, and a former spur of the Norfolk Southern Railway (now closed), and passes through Briceville, Fraterville which was the site of a 1902 mine explosion, \\"The Wye\\" near the former mining camp of Beech Grove, and finally through a gap in Walden Ridge to enter Rocky Top. Originally the northeastern terminus of SR 116 was in Rocky Top at the junction with US 25W. About 1982, SR 116 was extended northward to Caryville to incorporate the portion of the former US 25W between Rocky Top and Caryville superseded by I-75. This addition to Route 116 parallels the busy railroad lines of both the CSX and Norfolk Southern, and I-75 immediately to the west as it passes through the community of Vasper. Petros, Briceville, Rocky Top, and Caryville are the only towns of any sizeable population today along Route 116. History The highway has had a high rate of accidents, including fatal accidents, attributed to conditions including narrow shoulders, numerous curves, unstable slopes, rockfall hazards, and absence of guardrails. In 2013, the Tennessee Department of Transportation announced plans for $1.2 million in roadway improvements, including widening of shoulders and addition of guardrails, pavement markings and signs.

In the autumn of 1958, when Arsenal made an offer to Manchester United assistant manager Jimmy Murphy to become their new manager, Murphy offered Doherty the chance to become his assistant if he took charge at the North London club. However, Murphy then decided against moving to Arsenal and the partnership never happened As of 2006, John was chairman of the Former Manchester United Players Association and co-authored the book The Insider's Guide to Manchester United with Ivan Ponting, where he gave his opinion of over 300 United players (including himself) since 1950.

Meng worked as a factory worker in Beijing before getting involved in politics through the local Communist Youth League organization. He was the Vice Mayor of Beijing between 1993 and 2003, before being promoted to mayor for a brief interlude in 2003. He was sacked as mayor only after a few months on the job due to his government's mismanagement of the SARS epidemic. Meng then worked as a low- profile functionary in the South-North Water Transfer Project, before making a political comeback as the Governor of Shanxi province in 2007. He resigned that post a year into his term, following what was considered a botched response to the 2008 Shanxi mudslide by the provincial government. In December 2009, Meng was given a post on the body that manages the work of the directly- controlled organizations of the Communist Party's central committee (). In 2012, he gained a largely ceremonial post as the head of a legal affairs committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He has been a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China since November 2002. Career Meng was born in Penglai County, Shandong. Meng studied engineering at Beijing Normal University (1969‚Äì72) during the later stages of the Cultural Revolution before being assigned to Beijing's No.2 Motor Vehicle Plant. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in July 1972, rising through the ranks of the Beijing municipal Communist Youth League (CYL) and the car industry. In 1986 he was transferred to senior posts in the hospitality industry, briefly serving as General Manager of the Beijing Hotel group. He then spent four years (1991‚Äì1995) at the University of Science and Technology of China, alongside Qiang Wei, who had been a consistent colleague. After graduating with an MBA, he became a vice-mayor of Beijing in 1993. In January 2003, Meng was appointed Mayor of Beijing; as mayor he also held the title of Deputy Party Secretary of Beijing. The SARS crisis hit Beijing sometime in March of that year, and Meng is said to have moved patients between hospitals in a botched cover-up that worsened the outbreak. The Politburo Standing Committee decided to remove him from his posts on 16 April as part of a double sacking with health minister Zhang Wenkang. The pair were held responsible both for the public health failure and the damage to trust in the Party. The sacking was described by one journalist as \\"the biggest political earthquake since the time of Tiananmen in 1989.\\" The harsh treatment was privately questioned by other cadres in Beijing, but they were assured that Meng's co-operative attitude would be rewarded. Five months later, he was quietly created deputy director of the South-North Water Transfer Project, reporting to the State Council. Meng was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Party Committee on August 30, 2007 as part of a wider Party reshuffle, and then elected Vice Governor and acting Governor by the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress on 3 September. His political fortunes, however, proved short-lived when he tendered his resignation on September 14, 2008, after the mudslide in Xiangfen. Faction and policies Meng is a member of the tuanpai faction of former Communist Youth League officials and has close personal ties to Party General secretary Hu Jintao. As he stated himself, \\"My career in the CCYL provided a foundation for my political career later on.\\" At a news conference in January 2003, he portrayed himself as an old friend of Hu, stating \\"Comrade Jintao was a major leader in the Communist Youth League 20 years ago and some of us worked under his leadership... What I remember most deeply are his fairness, personal integrity and selflessness. Those qualities make up his unique charisma.\\" However, this has been subsequently disputed. See page 110, especially n.27. Hu allegedly fired his prot√©g√© in order to remove Zhang, linked to rival Jiang Zemin. Some reports claimed the mayor was \\"sacrificed\\" to protect Liu Qi. It was even claimed that Meng is closer to Liu (and thus Jiang) than Hu. However, most commentators saw Meng's return to power as a sign of the tuanpai faction's dominance. Ultimately much of this turned out to be irrelevant as tuanpai became a diminished force under the leadership of Xi Jinping. The People's Daily at one point portrayed Meng as reformist. Meng said that his CYL experience helps him stay in touch with young people and remain open-minded. Meng once resided in Beijing's Siheyuan, and kept in touch with his former neighbours during his time as mayor, claiming a special understanding of the people. On his election in Taiyuan, he told delegates, \\"I will do my utmost best to get familiar with Shanxi and become like a native... [the governorship is] a great honour, but also comes with great responsibility.\\" References External links *Official biography *China Vitae page Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Yantai Category:Mayors of Beijing Category:Governors of Shanxi Category:University of Science and Technology of China faculty Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shandong Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Shandong Category:Educators from Shandong Category:Deputy Party Secretaries of Shanxi Category:Deputy mayors of Beijing Category:People from Penglai, Shandong ","title":"Meng Xuenong"},{"id":"13133604","text":"Ulvaria is a genus of green algae in the family Ulvaceae.

She was married to the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Biography Early life Junia Secunda was daughter of Servilia (who was the half-sister of Cato the Younger and mistress of Julius Caesar) and Decimus Junius Silanus. She was the half-sister of Marcus Junius Brutus through her mother and full sister of Marcus Junius Silanus, Junia Prima and Junia Tertia. Marriage She married Lepidus, who later became a member of the Second Triumvirate, alongside Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus). Unlike his fellow triumvirs, Lepidus remained married to the same woman throughout his life, and seems to have been devoted to Junia. In his speeches, Cicero praised Junia as the ideal wife.Smith, William, Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Volume 2, Little and Brown, 1846, p. 657. In a private letter to Atticus, however, Cicero claimed that Junia was unfaithful to Lepidus, on the grounds that her portrait was seen among the chattels of a debauchee called Publius Vedius (possibly Publius Vedius Pollio), Syme, Ronald (1961). \\"Who was Vedius Pollio?\\" Journal of Roman Studies 51(1/2): 23‚Äì30. and expresses surprise that her husband and brother took no notice of her conduct.Cicero, ad Atticum, vi. 1.Hall, John, Politeness and Politics in Cicero's Letters, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 116. However some have argued that it was Junia Prima, rather than Junia Secunda, who had the affair with Vedius. Plot against Octavian After her husband was forced from power by Octavian, Junia lost much of her status. After the battle of Actium she became part of a plot to kill Octavian, formed by her son Lepidus the Younger. However it was foiled by Gaius Maecenas.Appian, J5. (7. iv, 50.) Her son was executed after being sent to Octavian, who was still in the east at the time. She was summoned to follow him to appear before Octavian. Her husband had to plead with his former enemy Lucius Saenius Balbinus to grant her bail so that she could remain with him until Octavian returned.Weigel, Richard D.

Described in 1859, it was one of the first fossil plants to be found which was of Devonian age (about ). Specimens have been found in northern Maine, USA; Gasp√© Bay, Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada; the Czech Republic; and Yunnan, China. Plants lacked leaves or true roots; spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne on the ends of branched clusters. It is significantly more complex than some other plants of comparable age (e.g. Rhynia) and is thought to be part of the group from within which the modern ferns and seed plants evolved. Description Almost all the species of Psilophyton have been found in rocks of Emsian age (around ). One exception is P. krauselii, from the Czech Republic, which is younger, being from the upper part of the Middle Devonian (around ). Psilophyton dawsonii is the best-known species. Compressed and mineralized specimens have been found in several locations, particularly in calcareous pebbles on the Gasp√© Peninsula, Quebec, Canada. Plants consisted of bare stems (axes) ending in blunt tips. Lower down they repeatedly branched dichotomously; higher up they bore sporangium-bearing 'units' in two rows on opposite sides of the stems. These units branched, also dichotomously, before terminating in sporangia, so that there were clusters of up to 128 paired, downward curved sporangia, oval in shape and about 5 mm long. Spores were released through a longitudinal slit. The first two branching points of the fertile units appear to have consisted of two closely spaced dichotomous branches in which the middle branch did not develop. The trilete spores were between 40 and 75 ¬µm in diameter. The internal structure of the stems of P. dawsonii was considerably more complex than that of other plants of a similar age, e.g. Rhynia. A central strand of xylem occupied up to a third of the diameter of the stem. In the lower parts of main stems it was circular, enlarging before it divided prior to dichotomous branching. Higher up it became elliptical in cross-section, corresponding to the two rows of fertile branching units. Within the branches of these units, the strand was more-or-less rectangular. The conducting elements of the xylem, the tracheids, were of the so-called 'P-type' in which the walls were strengthened by ladder- like (scalariform) bars with circular openings between them. The tissue around the central strand was multi-layered with open spaces below the stomata. P. princeps, the first-discovered species, differed from P. dawsonii in having spines on the stems and larger sporangia. P. forbesii is the largest known species of Psilophyton. Reconstructions suggest a height of around 60 cm. Its stems were bare of spines but marked by longitudinal striations. Compared to P. dawsonii, both P. princeps and P. forbesii had a greater distinction between main stems and side branches, which may be considered an 'advanced' feature. P. crenulatum was found in New Brunswick, Canada, also in rocks of Emsian age. Its branches bore spines up to 6 mm long which divided into two or three projections at their tips. It has resemblances to specimens of Aarabia, found in Morocco. P. dapsile was found in Maine, USA. It appears to have been considerably smaller than the previous species, perhaps 30 cm tall, with smooth dichotomously branching stems, and sporangia only 2 mm long. Kasper et al. suggested that the smaller species P. dapsile and P. krauselii, which had mainly dichotomous branches, were the more 'primitive' members of the genus. P. primitivum was found in Yunnan, China, in the Posongchong Formation, which is of Pragian (Siegenian) age (around ). All other species have been found in North America and Europe, which formed part of the continent of Laurussia in the Devonian. The name reflects a belief that the species is 'primitive', with considerable dichotomous branching and a loose, less tightly branched habit. As with all species of Psilophyton, pairs of sporangia were created by dichotomously branching fertile units, although in P. primitivum there were relatively few per unit (4‚Äì8) and they were somewhat loosely clustered. Similarities with P. microspinum and P. parvulum were suggested. Taxonomy Leafless, dichotomously branching fossils bearing spines and possessing vascular tissue from the Devonian of Gasp√© Peninsula, Canada, were thought by Dawson in 1859 to resemble the modern whiskfern, Psilotum. Accordingly, he named his new genus Psilophyton, the type species being P. princeps. Unfortunately, it later turned out that his description and subsequent reconstruction was based on fragments of three different unrelated plants, which caused confusion for many years. The sporangia were from Psilophyton, but some aerial stems were from what is now Sawdonia, and the rhizomes were from Taeniocrada. In 1871, Dawson described specimens which had strong spines as P. princeps var. ornatum. He considered that groups of paired terminal sporangia found with these were part of the same plant, although no actual connection was found. Much later, in 1967, it was shown that fossils called \\"Psilophyton princeps\\" had two very different patterns of xylem development: from the centre outwards (centrarch) in P. princeps and from the outside inwards (exarch) in P. princeps var. ornatum. Hueber and Banks selected new specimens as the type for the species P. princeps, and Hueber later transferred P. princeps var. ornatum to a new genus as Sawdonia ornata. Only P. princeps had paired terminal sporangia; those of S. ornata were borne on the sides of the stems. Later additions of species to the genus have been based on the description by Hueber and Banks. Dawson named another specimen Psilophyton robustius. On the grounds that this had side branches which divided into three as well as dividing into two, in 1956 Hopping moved it to a new genus Trimerophyton.  Phylogeny  At first most of the early polysporangiophytes (land plants other than liverworts, mosses and hornworts) were placed in a single class, Psilophyta, established in 1917 by Kidston and Lang. As additional fossils were discovered and described, it became apparent that the Psilophyta were not a homogeneous group of plants. In 1968, Banks proposed splitting it into three groups, one of which was the subdivision Trimerophytina, informally called the trimerophytes. Psilophyton was a prominent member of this group. The distinction between main stems and strongly branched lateral stems evident in species such as P. forbesii has been considered to be one of the key steps towards the evolution of the leaves of euphyllophytes (modern members of which are the ferns and seed plants), based on the theory that such leaves evolved through 'webbing' of flattened lateral branching systems. In 2004, Crane et al. published a simplified cladogram for the polysporangiophytes, based on a number of figures in Kenrick and Crane (1997). Part of their cladogram is reproduced below (with some branches collapsed into 'basal groups' to reduce the size of the diagram). It shows two of the better-known species of Psilophyton as early-diverging members of the euphyllophytes.

Livingstone was capped twice for the Scotland national team; his regular position was at inside forward.  Career  Livingstone was born in Dumbarton and started his career with local team Sinclair Swifts. He then moved to Artizan Thistle and Parkhead, before moving to Heart of Midlothian in the Scottish Football League, being part of the squad that won the competition in his first season, 1896‚Äì97, though he only played in four of the matches. He made 59 SFL and Scottish Cup appearances for the Edinburgh club, with 29 goals scored. In 1900, he joined Sunderland, but he only played there for a season (making 31 Football League and FA Cup appearances and scoring 12 goals ‚Äì the club were league runners-up) before moving to Celtic, where in his one season he made 23 SFL and Scottish Cup appearances and scored seven goals as they finished as runners-up in both the league and cup. In 1902, he moved back to England, signing for Liverpool (32 appearances, four goals) and then switched to Manchester City in 1903. He made 88 appearances for City, scoring 20 goals as the club won the 1904 FA Cup Final and were runners-up in the League in the same season. He returned to Scotland in 1906, playing for Rangers for two seasons and part of a third without winning a major trophy (53 appearances, 23 goals) before transferring to Manchester United in early 1909. He helped United win the 1910‚Äì11 Football League title (10 appearances in that campaign, from 46 and 3 goals overall) before retiring in 1914.George Livingstone, StredfordEnd He later served as manager of hometown club Dumbarton from early 1919 to late 1920 (also making one final league appearance as a player) and worked under Bill Struth at Rangers as the first team trainer.

It was developed by George L. Ellman. Preparation In Ellman's original paper, he prepared this reagent by oxidizing 2-nitro-5-chlorobenzaldehyde to the carboxylic acid, introducing the thiol via sodium sulfide, and coupling the monomer by oxidization with iodine. Today, this reagent is readily available commercially. Ellman's test Thiols react with this compound, cleaving the disulfide bond to give 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB‚àí), which ionizes to the TNB2‚àí dianion in water at neutral and alkaline pH. This TNB2‚àí ion has a yellow color. :Reaction of DTNB with a thiol (R-SH). This reaction is rapid and stoichiometric, with the addition of one mole of thiol releasing one mole of TNB. The TNB2‚àí is quantified in a spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of visible light at 412 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 14,150 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1 for dilute buffer solutions, and a coefficient of 13,700 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1 for high salt concentrations, such as 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride or 8 M urea. Unfortunately the extinction coefficient for dilute solutions was underestimated in the original 1959 publication, as 13,600 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1, and as noted in a recent article, this mistake has persisted in the literature. Commercial DTNB may not be completely pure, so may require recrystallization to obtain completely accurate and reproducible results. Ellman's reagent can be used for measuring low-molecular mass thiols such as glutathione in both pure solutions and biological samples, such as blood. It can also measure the number of thiol groups on proteins.

He is also noted in record books as being the first person to fly through the eye of a hurricane. Early life Duckworth was born in Savannah, Georgia in 1902. Aviation career Duckworth enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps as a Flying Cadet in 1927 and received his wings and reserve commission at Kelly Field, Texas, the following year. After graduation, he flew for Ford Motor Co., Curtiss-Wright Flying Service, and Eastern Air Lines. It was during this time that he developed his knowledge of instrument flight (obtaining a law degree from the University of Miami in the meantime). In late 1940, Duckworth was called to active duty in the rank of a major and promoted to lieutenant colonel soon after the US joined World War II. He was shocked at the profound ignorance of instrument flying throughout the Air Corps, and appalled that the losses sustained from that type of ignorance were greater than losses due to actual combat. During the rest of the war, he introduced his knowledge of instrument flying at various flying schools, first at Columbus Army Flying School in Columbus, Mississippi, then at Bryan Air Base, and helped to standardize instrument flight instruction within the Air Corps. Duckworth‚Äôs most notable single achievement occurred on July 27, 1943, when he flew an AT-6 single engine trainer into a small but strong hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston, Texas, becoming the first person to safely fly through a hurricane. After the war, he served as the head of the safety bureau of the Civil Aeronautics Board, retiring from the Air Force in 1955 after serving as base commander of Hickam AFB, Hawaii.

Neba Solo's music began to receive airplay on radio stations throughout his home region of Sikasso from the mid-1990s, particularly after the release of his recording \\"Hommage √† Lamissa Bengaly.\\" In 1996 he released another recording on the Malian market, entitled \\"Kenedougou Foly,\\" which included highly successful songs such as \\"Vaccination,\\" \\"Deli Fara,\\" \\"Noumou Foly,\\" and \\"Kenedougou Foly.\\" The songs combined the best of the balafon's danceable rhythms with key innovations including vocal accompaniment and a driving bass line. Lyrics were sung in Traor√©'s native Senoufo language as well as in Bambara, Mali's most widely spoken language. By 2002 Neba Solo's success had spread across Mali, and his group appeared regularly on nationally televised music shows. They composed and performed a popular anthem \\"CAN 2002\\" for the 2002 African Cup of Nations soccer tournament which Mali hosted. In the summer of 2003, they were part of Mali's delegation to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, one of a small number of musical artists to be so honored. Neba Solo has collaborated with artists from Mali as well as around the world, including French electronic musical artist Fr√©d√©ric Galliano and the Iranian percussion group Trio Chemirani. Some of his songs have also been remixed by DJs and released on compilations by Six Degrees Records. Neba Solo has toured in Europe and North America in addition to Africa.

El Bolero (1785), Museo del Prado Jos√© Camar√≥n Bonanat, or Bononat (18 May 1731, Segorbe - 14 July 1803, Valencia) was a Spanish draftsman, painter and engraver. Most early sources give his maternal family name as Boronat.  Life and works  His father, , was a sculptor and gave him his first art lessons. Later, in Valencia, he continued his studies with his uncle, Mos√©n Eliseo Bonanat (1697-1761), who created portrait miniatures, and with the painter, Miguel Posadas, who was also a Dominican friar. In 1752, he relocated to Madrid to complete his studies. Initially, he devoted himself to miniatures, landscapes, and copies of the Baroque masters, such as Titian, Rubens and Murillo. In 1754, he returned to Valencia, where he participated in an exhibition at the newly created Academia de Bellas Artes de Santa B√°rbara, and was named a Professor there. He maintained his contacts with Madrid, however, and was accepted as an honorary member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1762. Shortly after, he was among the founders of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia where, upon the death of Crist√≥bal Valero, he became the Director of Painting. From 1796 to 1801, he served as General Director. He resigned, following several trips to Madrid to treat his eyes for an unspecified ailment. He was a friend of the jurist and writer, Francisco P√©rez Bayer, who commissioned him to decorate the church of Saint Thomas of Villanova, which was under construction in Benic√†ssim; a project that occupied him from the late 1760s until 1776. He also participated in creating a major cycle of paintings at the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, Madrid. Also notable are the altarpieces at Valencia Cathedral and the frescoes he began at Segorbe Cathedral in 1800. They were unfinished when he died, and were completed by his son, Manuel, in 1806. Despite his focus on religious works, his genre scenes, in Rococo style, are his best known, as well as the illustrations he designed for a 1777 edition of Don Quixote. He was married to Juliana Meli√° in 1758, and they had five children. In addition to Manuel, his eldest son, , also became a painter.

O'Mahoney was a dual international and played for both Ireland teams ‚Äì the FAI XI and the IFA XI. Club career Early years Before establishing himself at Bristol Rovers, O'Mahoney was something of an under achieving journeyman player. He had initially been on the books of several teams in the Merseyside area and had spent uninspiring spells at both Liverpool and New Brighton before eventually making something of a breakthrough at Southport, where he made 12 league appearances. He then joined Wolves but failed to make it into the first team. After a brief spell with Newport County, where he made 8 league appearances, he signed for Bristol Rovers in May 1936. Bristol Rovers Between 1936 and 1939 O'Mahoney went onto make 101 English League appearances, scoring 6 goals, for Bristol Rovers. He also made a further 4 appearances for Rovers in the FA Cup. O'Mahoney also won all 7 of his international caps while playing for Rovers. During the Second World War he returned to Rovers as a guest player and made 24 South West League appearances and scored 4 goals in the 1939‚Äì40 season. He also scored 1 Wartime cup goal for Rovers. Ipswich Town In July 1939 O'Mahoney signed for Ipswich Town. However within a few months the Second World War broke out and Town did not enter any of the wartime regional leagues. After playing just 3 league games for the club he returned to Bristol Rovers as a guest. During the 1940‚Äì41 season he also played 4 games for Bristol City in the Southern Regional Division and between 1942 and 1944 he guested regularly for Aberaman Athletic in the Football League West. O'Mahoney returned to Ipswich Town when they resumed playing in the 1945‚Äì46 season, making 36 league appearances and scoring 3 goals. During three more seasons with Town he made a further 58 appearances and scored 5 goals in the English League. He made his last appearance for Town on 16 October 1948 in a Third Division South game against Norwich City. Irish international When O'Mahoney began his international career in 1938 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland ‚Äì based IFA and the Irish Free State ‚Äì based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including O'Mahoney, played for both teams. FAI XI Between 1938 and 1939 O'Mahoney played 6 times for the FAI XI. He made his first two appearances for the FAI XI in May 1938 during a European tour. On 18 May he played in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Czechoslovakia and then on 22 May he played in a 6‚Äì0 defeat against Poland. The highlight of his international career came during his third game against Switzerland on 18 September 1938. O'Mahoney earned the unusual distinction of becoming the first FAI XI international to fly in for a home game. He arrived from Bristol only an hour before kick-off, but proceeded to play superbly, helping the FAI XI to a 4‚Äì0 win. On 13 November 1938 he played in a winning FAI XI for the second time when he helped them beat Poland 3‚Äì2 in another home game. O'Mahoney made his final two appearances for the FAI XI in May 1939 during another European tour, helping them to 2‚Äì2 and 1‚Äì1 draws with Hungary and Germany respectively. These were the last two internationals that the FAI XI played before the start of the Second World War. IFA XI O'Mahoney made his 1 and only appearance for the IFA XI on 8 November 1938 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat against Scotland at Windsor Park. He had earned an IFA XI call up after his impressive performance for the FAI XI against Switzerland the previous month. He was the only debutant on the day and his teammates included fellow dual internationalists Tommy Breen, Jackie Brown, Jimmy McAlinden and Alex Stevenson.

It is the only species currently classified in the genus Gevuina. It is native to southern Chile and adjacent valleys in Argentina. It is found from sea level to 700 meters (2300 feet) above sea level. Its distribution extends from 35¬∞ to 44¬∞ south latitude. The composite leaves are bright green and toothed, and the tree is in flower between July and November. The flowers are very small and beige to whitish, are bisexual and group two by two in long racemes. The fruit is a dark red nut when young and turns black. The peel is woody. It can grow up straight or branched from the soil, making up either a tree or a shrub. The name Gevuina comes from , the Mapuche Indian name for the Chilean hazel. The origin of the Spanish name, avellano come from the fact the Spanish settlers found the nuts similar to the hazelnuts they knew from Europe. Yet the species are not closely related. The concentration of Gevuina avellana in forest is highly irregular and difficult to predict. It may grow on flatland or hilly terrain, in clay or stony soils. Usually Gevuina avellana grows in association to other broad-leaved trees such as Nothofagus obliqua, Nothofagus dombeyi, Nothofagus alpina, Nothofagus glauca or Laureliopsis. Yet it does also grow in associations dominated by the conifers Austrocedrus, Fitzroya and Pilgerodendron. As such Gevuina avellana does not form pure stands. Taxonomy Gevuina is a genus of either 1 or 3 species of the family Proteaceae. In some classifications, Gevuinia is recognised with three species: one endemic to Australia (Gevuina bleasdalei), another to New Guinea (Gevuina papuana), and one species in both Chile and Argentina (Gevuina avellana). Other taxonomic reports place the Australian and New Guinea species in the genus BleasdaleaA.C.Smith & J.E.Haas, 1975. American Journal of Botany, 62: 142. or in the Fijian endemic genus Turrillia, and leave Gevuina with only Gevuina avellana.A.C.Smith, 1985. Flora Vitiensis Nova 3: 754. The Flora of Australia retains these 2 species in Gevuinia, but the most recent classification places the Australian and New Guinea species as Bleasdalea bleasdalei and B. papuana Uses and cultivation The seeds are eaten raw, cooked in boiling water or toasted. The nuts contain about 12 percent protein, 49 percent oil, and 24 percent carbohydrates.Facciola. S. Cornucopia - A Source Book of Edible Plants. Kampong Publications 1990 The seed has a very high concentration of monounsaturated oils and is also obtained for several purposes in Chile. It is rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E (Œ±-tocotrienol) and Œ≤-carotene. Its oil is an ingredient in some sunscreens. Gevuina oil is a used as cosmetic ingredient for its moisturizing qualities and because it is a source of omega 7 fatty acids (palmitoleic acid).FR 2681530 A1 (SO.F.I.A. Cosmetiques (S.A.R.L.)) 26.03.1993 Procution of seeds may vary greatly from tree to tree. The tree is a good honey plant for bees and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant. The seed shells contain tannin that is used for tanning leather. The tree has an acceptable frost resistance (at least ‚àí12 ¬∞C (10 ¬∞F)) when mature. The wood is cream-colored with dark brown streaking and is used in cabinetry and musical instruments. It was introduced to Great Britain in 1826. It grows well there, in Ireland and in New Zealand and California. A few specimens are cultivated in Spain and in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It grows well in temperate oceanic climates with cool temperatures where frosts occur commonly in winter, and has thrived in southern New Zealand. It needs 5 years to first harvest and 7 or 8 years for full production. In Seattle, Washington, squirrels and birds eat seeds from the trees. New varieties of greater yield than the original wild stock are being developed in both Chile and New Zealand. As of 1982 only a tiny faction of the nuts of wild stands were collected for processing.

History Fr Thomas P Lee was a young Irish priest ordained at All Hallows Missionary College in Dublin, Ireland; originally from Limerick. He first was sent in 1859 to be the resident priest in Kilbirnie in Ayrshire. He travelled by horse weekly from his base in Johnstone in the neighbouring county of Renfrewshire to Kilbirnie. Somehow he raised the money and found land to build his church and chose as the patron saint of the parish, St. Brigid (devotion to the poor). Opened in 1862, the modest structure was a Gothic styled rectangular building with a gallery, porch, vestry, confessional and a related presbytery. At the time, Kilbirnie parish was in the Archdiocese of Glasgow, hence the connection with Johnstone. Following the reorganisation of the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1947, parishes in the northern part of Ayrshire were transferred to the Diocese of Galloway. It was decided that the increasing post war population called for the church to be renovated and enlarged. There was to be an extension to the rear of the existing church. In front a new porch and baptistery were added to the old structure. The renovated and expanded church was opened in 1957. Conveniently the schoolmaster's house next door was also purchased to replace the more distant presbytery on Parkhouse Drive. When the church was completed there was to be a new sanctuary and sacristy with accommodation for the altar boys.

The neighborhood boundaries are Mandela Parkway to the east, 7th Street to the south, West Grand Avenue to the north, and Frontage Road to the west. History The area was originally part of Oakland Point. It was a residential area of Victorian homes, many of which still stand, some in disrepair and some having undergone rehabilitation. The neighborhood has suffered from high rates of crime, gang activity, and poverty since the decline of Oakland's industrial economy in the late 20th century. The neighborhood earned its nickname after the construction of the Cypress Freeway in the 1950s that split the West Oakland neighborhood in two and isolated Oakland Point from the remainder of West Oakland. The one housing project is Campbell Village Court. Seventh Street was an African-American cultural center of Oakland from the 1940s to the 1960s, due to nightclubs such as Slim Jenkins' Place, Esther's Orbit Room and the Lincoln Theater, which drew top blues and jazz performers from across the United States. The area was sometimes referred to as \\"The Harlem of the West.\\" The decline of Seventh Street has been blamed on the construction of the Cypress Freeway, the Oakland Main Post Office‚Äîand subsequent BART elevated track lines, which took up much of the street. At the corner of Tenth and Center Streets, Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party, was gunned down in an alleged failed drug deal on August 22, 1989. Gentrification The Bottoms is undergoing gentrification,Village Bottoms Cultural District similar to neighboring \\"Dogtown\\" area of West Oakland. Once the most devalued neighborhood in Oakland, the Lower Bottoms now has some newly rehabilitated Victorian homes that have recently sold for $700,000. It is now a slightly more sought after area to live in because of its location as a historic center of the Bay Area and its proximity to BART.  Points of interest   Architectural Landmarks  16th Street Station 16th Street Station is an abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad station and historical landmark located in the Prescottneighborhood of Oakland, California, United States. The Beaux-Arts building was designed by architect Jarvis Hunt, a preeminent railroad station architect, and opened in 1912. The station has not been served by trains since 1994, and is currently available as a rental space for private events through 2021. The station has also served as a film location for the 2005 film Rent and Vallejo rapper E-40's \\"Tell Me When to Go\\" video.  Performance Arts  Trapeze Arts Trapeze Arts is a unique performance arts school that teaches flying trapeze and other circus arts to adults and children of all ages and is one of only a handful of full time Circus Schools in the United States.  Parks & Green Space  Mandela Parkway is a major street and greenway in West Oakland that was created following the collapse of the Nimitz freeway Cypress Street Viaduct on October 17, 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake. American Steel Studios, Horn Barbecue, and the Cypress Freeway Memorial Park are all located on Mandela Parkway and its southern end goes right into the West Oakland BART Station. Raimondi Park (aka ‚ÄúErnie Raimondi Park‚Äù) is West Oakland's largest park 10 acres. It includes an Athletic Field located at 18th Street & Wood Street. Dedicated in 1947, the park was named in honor of Ernie Raimondi (1919‚Äì1945), a minor league baseball player and WWII veteran who grew up in Oakland. In September, 2008, the first of two stages of a $7.2 million refurbishment of the park was completed. This included new drainage systems for the playing fields.  Transportation & BART Station Redevelopment  The West Oakland BART station is located in Prescott, on 7th Street, and is one stop from downtown Oakland and downtown San Francisco. All lines except the Richmond-Warm Springs/South Fremont line stop at the station. In June 2020, the BART Board of Directors approved a mixed-use housing and commercial development at the West Oakland BART station that will include 762 housing units, 30 percent of which will be designated as affordable, 50,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of office space and various amenities such as wider sidewalks and more crosswalks for pedestrians. Community Organizations Several community organizations are based in Prescott, including the Lower Bottoms Neighborhood Association, the Prescott- Joseph Center, UNIA, Alliance for West Oakland Development, Prescott-Oakland Point Neighborhood Association, and the Lower Bottom Playaz theater troupe. Commercial outlets like City Slicker Farms, Revolution Cafe, Bikes 4 Life, and Mo Better Foods serve the community. In 2006, a locally owned full-service cooperative grocery store named Mandela Foods Cooperative (member of the Network of Bay Area Worker Cooperatives) opened in West Oakland, providing residents access to fresh produce, and focusing on nutritional education and affordable foods grown locally. Political representation The entire neighborhood lies within the boundaries of Oakland's Downtown-West Oakland District 3 City Council seat.

Variables and Assignment  Variables are declared in a manner similar to Pascal. * VAR MYVAR: INT; To assign a value: * 5 -> MYVAR; Note: The digraph '->' is colloquially called the gazinta operator (because, in the example above, 5 goes into (=gazinta) MYVAR).

Orban was Hungarian, according to most modern authors, while some scholars also mention his potential German ancestry. Alternative theories suggest he had Wallachian roots. Laonikos Chalkokondyles used the term Dacian to describe him. He had initially offered his services to the Byzantines in 1452, one year before the Ottomans attacked the city, but the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI could not afford Orban's high salary nor did the Byzantines possess the materials necessary for constructing such a large siege cannon. Orban then left Constantinople and approached the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, who was preparing to besiege the city. Claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of Babylon itself', Orban was given abundant funds and materials by the sultan. Orban managed to build the giant size gun within three months at Adrianople, from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople. In the meantime, Orban also produced other smaller cannons used by the Turkish siege forces. Bombarding technology similar to Orban's had first been designed for the Hungarian Army and rose in popularity during the early 1400s all over western Europe, transforming siege warfare. Examples of pieces similar to Orban's productions like the Faule Mette, Dulle Griet, Mons Meg and the Pumhart von Steyr are still extant from the period. Orban, along with an entire crew, was probably killed during the siege when one of his cannons exploded, which was not an unusual occurrence during that time.  In popular culture  * Master Orban was played by Burhanettin √úskan in the 1951 Turkish film, ƒ∞stanbul'un Fethi. * Erdoƒüan Aydemir played Orban in the 2012 film Fetih 1453. In the film, it is storied that Orban has made a sketch for the Doge of Genoa (Ali Ersin Yenar), but the Doge wasn't interested in his sketch. Orban has an adopted daughter named Era (Dilek Serbest) who has a romantic relationship with Ulubatlƒ± Hasan (ƒ∞brahim √áelikkol). * Master Orban is played by Tansu Bi√ßer in the 2020 Netflix production, Rise of Empires: Ottoman.

History Ranked fifteenth on Time Out's coolest neighborhoods in the world list in 2020, the community is known for its violence and blight . Some people believe the name originates from a drug kingpin who referred to the area as a ghost town due to the shortage of other drug dealers whose absence was attributed to the kingpin's dominance over the area. Others believe it derives from the two former casket companies located side by side on Filbert Street between 30th and 32nd Streets. Ghost Town stretches from 27th Street to 35th Street in the area immediately southwest of the MacArthur Maze. Others see the neighborhood bounded by Adeline on the West and San Pablo on the East. Ghost Town Farms, one of the more successful expressions of urban agriculture activity in Oakland is located in the heart of the district at 2727 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, between 27th and 28th Streets. The area is also one of Oakland's many open-air art galleries, with exceptional muralist work continually on exhibition, particularly along Martin Luther King Jr. Way. This neighborhood has an active citizen crime patrol, including one group of seniors who walk the neighborhood weekly to get physical exercise and report blight. Jerry Brown, governor of California and former Mayor of Oakland stated: \\"Instead of an omnibus crime bill, you have to deal with shootings in Ghost Town in West Oakland and sideshows in East Oakland.\\" Brown made attempts to turn around the blighted West Oakland neighborhood after 60 Minutes featured it in a television profile. Housing prices have increased. So has drug dealing, especially since nearby parks were closed by the City of Oakland. Prostitution, in 2015, has been on the decline for at least a decade. The term \\"ghost riding\\" has been attributed to this Oakland neighborhood. According to the Contra Costa Times and The Washington Post, local rapper Mistah F.A.B. popularized the term with his song \\"Ghost Ride It\\".\\"The hip list: best, worst of '06\\", Contra Costa Times, December 26, 2006.

Its strategy, according to the Human Services Department, is \\"based on best practices, has community builders going door-to- door to support and encourage neighbors to address their issues (e.g., typically truant youth, blight, and loitering) and help them ultimately to organize (e.g., Friends of Durant Park, West Oakland Mini-Grant Committee, Resident Action Council, Block captains, neighborhood watches, Home Alert, Renters or Home Owners' Associations) and take ownership of their communities.

It is built from local granite in a simple French style but with several features, especially windows, which could have been derived from Irish medieval origins. When the church opened in 1863, the spire was not yet built. Work on it began in 1865 but completion was delayed by storms until 1870. This 53.3 m (175 ft) landmark, buttressed and crowned by pinnacles, an octagonal drum and spire, can be seen far and wide from the surrounding countryside and from distance out to sea. For a further 10 years the tower remained empty until the peal of eight bells was hung. It is said that the impetus for a collection for a peal of bells came in a visit to Bray in 1877 with a remark by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone that \\"so noble a church tower as this should not be silent\\". The bells first rung out in 1881 (exactly 20 years after construction of the church started). They are still rung each year at midnight on 31 December to welcome a new year. The bells at Christ Church have been described as one of the finest peals in the whole of Ireland.https://web.archive.org/web/20070702035448/http://bray.dublin.anglican.org/history.html Organ The organ of Christ Church was built by the organ builders Peter Conacher and Co. in 1911. It has 30 stops spread over three manuals and pedals. It was built in the style of its time; late English Romantic and is typical of that era. Unusually, the choir vestry occupies the organ case at ground level, with the pipework being housed above it. Currently, a restoration is taking place by the Irish organbuilding firm Trevor Crowe Ltd. It is planned to restore Co. Wickow's largest organ to full playability, and enhance the tonal specification at a later date. As of late 2015, a new console has been fitted and some restoration work has been carried out. The organ's specification is summarised as: * Great: Double Diapason 16, Open Diapason (Large) 8, Open Diapason (Small) 8, Gamba 8, Rohrflote 8, Principal 4, Harmonic Flute 4, Twelfth 2 2/3, Mixture III, Fifteenth 2 Trumpet 8. * Swell: Bourdon 16, Open Diapason 8, Rohrflote 8, Salicional 8, Voix Celeste 8, Principal 4, Mixture II, Horn 8, Oboe 8, Tremulant. * Choir: Flauto Traverso 8, Dulciana 8, Wald Flute 4, Piccolo 2, Orchestral Oboe 8, Clarinet 8. * Pedal: Open Diapason 16, Bourdon 16, Unison 8, Trombone 16. * Couplers: Swell to Great, Swell Octave to Great, Swell to Pedal, Swell to Choir, Great to Pedal, Choir to Pedal, Choir Suboctave. Organists and choir The current organist and director of music is John Morris. Former organists include Derek Verso, Stuart O'Sullivan, David Bedlow and Sandra Bedlow. The church has a large, robed, mixed-voice choir of children and adults, who lead the singing on Sundays.

Acorn, also known as \\"The Corns\\" or the \\"Cornfields\\", neighbors a wide variety of public housing. It is bordered by the high rise City Towers Apartments and low rise Mohr Apartments to the South, Cypress Village to the West, Market Street to the east and 10th Street to the north. Originally consisting of three housing units, Acorn 1, Acorn 2 and Acorn 3, The City of Oakland Housing Authority renovated the entire Acorn housing complex during the late 1990s in efforts to combat crime. Acorn 2 and Acorn 3 were renamed \\"Town Center Apartments at Acorn\\" and \\"Courtyard Apartments at Acorn\\". Meanwhile, Acorn 1 was completely demolished and small community of two-story single-family houses between Filbert and Market Streets were built in its place. Adjacent to Acorn, there are three high-rise buildings known as the City Towers (formally named Apollo Housing) that resemble the high-rises of Chicago and New York City. Technically, City Towers (or \\"The Highrises\\" as they are known to locals) are a separate community of housing projects however, during the renovation of Acorn in the 1990s, many of the original residents of Acorn were relocated to City Towers. As a result, City Towers are often mistaken as being part of the same public housing units as Acorn. Acorn is home to the Acorn street gang.http://cbs5.com/crime/acorn.ghost.town.2.1870487.html Due to close proximity, skirmishes between Acorn and neighboring Cypress Village as well as Lower Bottoms occur frequently. In order to reduce the violence between the two housing projects, in 2003 local rappers from both Acorn and Cypress released an underground mixtape titled Acorn & Cypress inspired by other unity rap albums like the Bloods and Crips Bangin' on Wax releases. Since then, West Oakland based rap label Livewire Records founded by J Stalin (who originates from Cypress Village) has signed numerous rappers from both housing units, including Acorn native Shady Nate. In 2014, the housing project was featured in season 5, episode 2 of the National Geographic Channel television show Drugs, Inc.. A segment of the episode titled \\"Cokeland\\", was filmed in and around the Acorn and City Towers housing complexes.

A secondary lens may be designed to be used either in front of the primary lens, between it and the subject, or behind the primary lens, between it and the film. Secondary lenses are typically simpler in mechanical design than other photographic lenses. Normally but not always there is no provision for control of focus or aperture, as these are achieved by the controls on the primary lens. Lenses used in front of the primary lens Examples of secondary lenses designed to be used in front of the primary lens are: * Fisheye adaptors * Corrected wide angle adaptors * Telephoto adaptors such as teleside converters * Close-up lenses All of these typically mount on the filter ring of the primary lens. Front-mounting secondary lenses are commonly used to provide wide-angle and telephoto lenses for cameras which lack the facility to change the primary lens, such as consumer and \\"prosumer\\" video cameras and camcorders, bridge cameras, point- and-shoot cameras and some older consumer medium format cameras. Lenses used behind the primary lens Teleconverters The most common secondary lens used behind the primary lens is the teleconverter. A typical teleconverter has a male and a female lens mount of the same type, to allow it to be used between a primary lens and a camera body of the matching system. The resulting combination has a greater focal length than the primary lens alone, and the same absolute aperture, so its f-number is increased accordingly. Some teleconverters are dedicated or matched to particular primary lenses, normally one or more lenses by the same manufacturer as the teleconvertor, and when used in this combination deliver quality comparable to the primary lens. Others are general-purpose, and in use typically offer less image quality then a primary lens of the same quality, but allow a camera kit to offer a wider variety of focal lengths with a smaller number of lenses, saving in both cost and weight. It is not normally possible to construct a similar wide-angle adaptor, as the angle of view of the primary lens is matched to the film format for which is designed, and unwanted light is typically stopped by baffles. Any device similar to a teleconvertor designed to use the primary lens for wider angles than those for which it is designed is therefore likely to cause vignetting. Cross-system adaptors Specialised secondary lenses may be used behind the primary lens to adapt a lens of one camera system and/or film format to another. These are called active adaptors or converters. For example, a Pentax screw mount lens cannot normally be mounted on a Nikon F-mount camera, as the Nikon bayonet mount is further from the film plane than the Pentax screw mount, leaving no room for a mount adaptor. However active adaptors are available containing a (not very powerful) teleconverter, which makes the combination mechanically possible, albeit with a small amount of cropping at the image edges and loss of connection of the camera to any lens automation. The optical components of these adaptors may reduce or increase the focal length of the combination, or they may affect only the back focal distance of the combination, leaving the effective focal length for purposes of photographic composition unchanged.

It is noted for the 13th-century cathedral which stands on the site of the original church founded by Saint Paul Aur√©lien in the 6th century and the Notre-Dame du Kreisker Chapel, with its 80-metre-high spire, the highest in Brittany. It was also the scene of the a battle during the Breton War of Succession, where the Montfortists and their English allies defeated an army led by Charles of Blois.  History  A view of Saint Paul Aur√©lien cathedral with its two towers It was formerly the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Pol-de-L√©on, a bishopric established in the 6th century but abolished under the Concordat of 1801, when its territory was transferred to the Diocese of Quimper. It is dedicated to its 6th-century founder, the first bishop Saint Paul Aurelian. He was originally from Wales and is considered to have been the first bishop of the L√©on area. We know something of Aur√©lien's life thanks to a manuscript written in 884 by a Land√©vennec monk. Paul Aur√©lien was born in Wales in around 490, and educated at the Saint Iltud school. He was ordained as a priest and in 525 left Wales for the continent with a dozen companions. He landed at the Ile d'Ouessant and preached along the north Finist√®re coast up to the √éle de Batz. According to legend, he helped free the √éle de Batz from a dragon which was terrorising the local population. The cathedral replaced an earlier romanesque basilica founded by Bishop Haman and was built in various stages. The nave, west fa√ßade and the south porch date to the 13th century and the bishopric of Bishop Desilon, whilst the choir and transept date to the early 15th century. The building was completed in the second half of the 16th century. Built on the site of an ancient Roman church, some vestiges of which still exist. This great monument has been constructed in several stages. The present building, however, although on the same site, was built in the 13th century (with later additions). The facade with its two high towers and the remarkable nave from the 13th century made of limestone from Caen demonstrate the stylistic and economical heritage from Normandy. The western fa√ßade and the south porch date back from the 13th century whereas the chancel (choir made of granite) and the transept are from the beginning of the 15th century. The cathedral was completed in the second half of the 16th century (the ambulatory and the southern chapel). It also has an ensemble which is almost unique in Brittany. The 50-metre spires are from the end of the 14th century. In the 16th century, side chapels gave it its definitive stature. The cathedral is 80 metres long in total, 16-metre height under the vaults and 44 metres wide with the transepts. In the north tower, there are three bells which date from more than three centuries ago, including the oldest bourden bell in Brittany, which weighs more than 2 tonnes, and was cast in 1563. The cathedral represented the seven parishes of Minihy-L√©on which in 1698 were the Crucifix de la ville, Notre-Dame de Cahel, Saint-Jean de la ville or Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Toussaints, Saint-Pierre, Crucifix des Champs and Saint-Jean l'Evang√©liste or Tr√©gondern. Amongst the many altars in the cathedral are altars dedicated to each of these parishes. In 1901 the cathedral was designated the \\"Basilique Mineure de l'Annonciation\\". Brief overview of the cathedral's main features The nave looking towards the apse Beyond its great architectural significance, the cathedral shelters a multitude of unusual artistic curiosities. * The great organ in the cathedral built between 1657 and 1660 by the English refugees Robert and Thomas Dallam. It is composed of 2118 pipes and is a listed monument. * A 16th-century oak stall. * Various relics including Paul Aur√©lien's Celtic bell, one of the oldest Carolingian bells in Brittany and, in a crystal tube, a thorn from Christ's crown. * 32 boxes containing skulls, a reminder of the custom in use until the 19th century, which involved exhuming skeletons from the cemetery after five years in order to make room for the new deceased. The bones were carefully laid in the charnel house and the skulls were locked in small pierced boxes. These were then handed over to the deceased's families, many of whom chose to have the boxes put on display in the cathedral. * The stone (tomb) of Marie-Amice Picard which contains the remains of one of the most extraordinary figures of the history of mysticism. She died in 1652, and in her day she has attracted the attention of some of the greatest European minds. She survived 17 years without taking any food and was eventually to suffer martyrdom. * A Roman sarcophagus which is thought to be the sepulture of Conan M√©riadec, first Christian king of Brittany, who died in 421. * The ciborium containing the Holy Eucharist. It is located above the high altar, it has the shape of a palm tree which traditionally symbolised both eternity and the resurrection. There are three similar ciboriums in France (in Amiens, Reims and Saint-Germain).  The cathedral exterior  The cathedral fa√ßade is dominated by two polygonal unsymmetrical towers with a height nearing 50 metres. Above the central door is a terrace which enabled the bishop to address a crowd and give blessings and under the right-hand tower is a small door used in the Middle Ages as an entrance for lepers.

The south portal and porch  The south porch with a statue of Christ giving a blessing in the trumeau Not as deep as the usual porch, the south porch is decorated with statues of John the Evangelist and saint Simon carved by the Yves Hernot workshop in the 19th century on one side and saint Andrew and saint Peter carved by Guy Pavec in 1980 on the other. It leads to double doors which give access to the cathedral. In the trumeau between the two doors is a statue of Christ giving a blessing (\\"Christ Sauveur du Monde\\") and in the tympanum over the doors is a statue of the Virgin Mary, Between the two doors leading into the cathedral there is also a stoup with the coat of arms of the Lom√©rals of Ploun√©venter. Beneath the statue of the Virgin Mary and on the left are the coat of arms of Monseigneur Ferron and on the right the Validire arms and their motto \\"Quem timebo, time deum\\". Monseigneur Validire was the Bishop of L√©on from 1427 to 1432.  The cathedral interior  File:Saint-Pol 03 Cath√©drale La nef.JPG|View of the cathedral nave, the choir in the distance File:Saint-Pol 20 Cath√©drale Le choeur.JPG|View of the cathedral choir with the famous oak stalls on either side of the approach to the main altar Near the south portal and inside the cathedral are two stoups. The stoup on the right bears the arms of Monseigneur Robert Cupif (1639-1646) and at the bottom has the inscription \\"In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti\\". That on the left is decorated with carvings of frogs, lizards and eels. Also in this area is a sarcophagus thought to date back to the 11th century and believed by some historians to be the grave of Conan Meriadoc the first Christian king of Brittany. This sarcophagus is 2.34 metres in length and is decorated with many carvings including that of a tree without leaves a traditional image of death.  The south nave   The baptistery and stained glass window entitled \\"Les ≈ìuvres de mis√©ricorde\\"  The window representing \\"Les ≈ìuvres de mis√©ricorde\\" or the good works of the church The cathedral has a baptistery carved from oak located to the right of the south porch entrance. It was the work of the studio of Derrien-Pondaven based in Saint-Pol-de-L√©on and dates to 1897. This area of the cathedral was at one time the chapel of Saint Martin and originally Monseigneur de Kersauzon's tomb was located here until moved to the choir area. The font itself is carved from granite. The Saint Martin chapel has three small windows, two are plain but one comprises four panels and is a stained glass window known as the \\"Les oeuvres de mis√©ricords\\". This window dates to 1560 and is one of the oldest in the cathedral. It deals with the church's good works. In one panel inscribed \\"AEGROS CVRARE\\", the subject is the healing of the sick, in the panel inscribed \\"SVRIENTES PASCEREE\\", the subject is feeding the hungry, the panel inscribed \\"PEREGRINOS COLLIGERE\\" deals with giving hospitality to travellers and in the panel inscribed \\"CAPTOS REDIMERE\\", the subject is freeing those in captivity. The window bears the coat of arms of the Kerseau family who lived in le Minihy and their motto \\"En Espoir Mieux\\". Some of the pillar capitals in this area are remnants of the earlier Roman basilica. The baptistry  The south transept   The Rose window  Rose window. At the centre of the rose is a representation of the \\"Trinity\\". At the base of the window lancets depict Jesus' arrest, Jesus in front of Pontius Pilate, Jesus being mocked and beaten (\\"la D√©rision\\"), the journey to Calvary, the crucifixion and the descent from the cross. This window was the work of the Lobin glass painting workshop in Tours and dates to 1873. At the heart of the window is a depiction of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" and around this image are eight depictions of angels playing various musical instruments and in a ring around these eight depictions are a further sixteen depictions of prophets, martyrs and saints either singing or playing instruments. A veritable celestial choir! Six panels at the base of the window depict, from left to right, Judas' kiss of betrayal, Jesus in front of Pontius Pilate, Jesus being mocked, Jesus on the journey to Calvary, the crucifixion and the descent from the cross. Beneath this window are two enfeus. That on the left bears the coat of arms of the Kersauzon family and the enfeu on the right bears the coat of arms of Louet-Kersauzon and the coat of arms of Kergorlay. In this area is another enfeu with a marble plaque reading \\"Cy gist le corps de dame Marguerite Br√©hant, dame de Lavergat, more le 18e jour d'ao√ªt 1713, pries pour le repos de son √¢me\\". Here one can see a small door which was at one time used to access the cemetery which once surrounded the cathedral. Near to this rose window is an altar in white marble dedicated to the Sacr√©- Coeur. In the transept vaulting are four √©cus carrying the coats of arms of some of the families who contributed to the construction and ornamentation of the transept, the Plessis family, the family of Lesco√´t Barbier, the Richard family and the Chavign√©s. The window was a gift from some Saint-Pol-de-L√©on clerics. Also in the south transept is a statue of Joan of Arc by Charles Desvergnes and nearby a statue of saint Paul Aur√©lien. There is also a statue of saint Anthony the Hermit (51) dating to 1750. and nearby two crucifix. One dates to the 15th century and came from the \\"Crucifix des Champs\\" one of the seven parishes of Minihy-L√©on. The second crucifix is known as the \\"Crucifix de la ville\\". There is also a painting of Jesus on the cross entitled \\"La D√©ploration\\". This oil painting is signed Charles Lefebvre and dates to 1846. It was a gift to the cathedral from Napoleon III in around 1860. The Virgin Mary is shown kissing Jesus' feet. Beneath this painting is an enfeu which bears the coat of arms of Tr√©dern, a family who lived at Plougoulm. According to Peyron, Guillaume de Tr√©dern, a canon of L√©on had founded a chapel devoted to Saint J√©r√¥me in 1510 and an altar can be seen to the right of the enfeu, this altar dedicated to Saint J√©r√¥me. Another oil painting in this area is entitled \\"Pr√©sentation de la r√®gle des Minimes par Saint Fran√ßois de Paule\\". This 17th-centiury painting is located to the left of Lefebvre's masterpiece. It came from the Minimes chapel which was demolished in 1893. It depicts a Franciscan friar, almost certainly Saint Francis of Paola, holding the book laying down the rules of the Minimes group. On the book is an inscription reading \\"Haec regula mitis et sancta\\". He holds the book up to a crowd of onlookers which includes various clerics. The third painting in the south transept depicts the Annunciation. It had been displayed in the cathedral choir area during the 1901 celebration when the cathedral was designated a basilica; the basilica of the Annunciation. Just by this painting and in the third ogive there is a cartouche surmounted by a mitre and cross carried by two angels. The cartouche bears the coat of arms of Monseigneur Guy le Clerc who was the L√©on bishop from 1514 to 1521 and his motto \\"Battons et Abattons\\". Guy le Clerc was almoner to Queen Claude de France, the wife of Fran√ßois the First.  The south ambulatory   The Saint-Roch chapel and altar (45)  This altar dates to 1854 and has a statue of saint Roch on the left side and saint Sebastian on the right side.

He was the Bishop of Geneva. The altar represents the parish of Saint-Jean l'Evangile, one of the seven parishes of Minihy-L√©on. Just by the saint Roch altar there is an enfeu containing the tomb of Jean Le Scaff who was the s√©n√©chal of L√©on in 1500 and his wife Anne du Bois of Kerlosquet. The tomb, in engraved black marble, is just by the Saint-Roch chapel. On the tomb there is a carving showing the arms of the Le Scaff family. The vaulting in the chapel bears the heraldic shields of the Kerrom and Carman-Lesquelen families as well as that of the Kerliviry de Cl√©der family. In this chapel are two stained glass windows. One is dedicated to the Le Scaffs and depicts saint Michael looking down on the fires of hell and the other shows John the Evangelist at Patmos. In a scene depicting the \\"Last Judgement\\" Saint Michael looks down on the fires of Hell. The outer lancets depict Jean le Scaff and his wife. The \\"fires of hell\\" window of three lancets depicts the last judgement with saint Michael looking down on the fires of hell with demons and some of the damned squirming in torment. A sign on a column reads \\" Domine, in nomine tuo daemonia subjiciuntur nobis\\" and below that \\"Et cruciabuntur igne et sulfure angelorum in conspectu\\". In the first lancet, that on the left, John the Baptist is shown presenting Jean le Scaff. John carries the inscription \\"ECCENTRIC AGNUS DEI\\". The third lancet shows sainte Anne and John the Evangelist holding a chalice and presenting Anne du Bois, Le Scaff's wife, who also donated funds to the cathedral.

There is also a large wooden crucifix in the chapel which came from the Minihy parish of \\"Le crucifix des champs\\". As we leave the Saint-Roch chapel we see three small altars with a credence and a piscina. The first two altars are carved from white stone whilst the third which faces the Sainte-Anne chapel is carved from Kersanton. The altarpiece of this third altar depicts the Virgin Mary with the body of Jesus laid across her knees.  The Sainte Anne chapel, altar and altarpiece (42)  The chapel altar dates to the 17th century and has a statue of sainte Anne in the centre, saint Vincent de Paul on the left side and saint Francis on the right side.

This stained glass window dates to 1891 and represents the parable related in Luke 18- \\"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein\\". Against the chapel wall there is an oil painting of 1757 depicting Saint Pol defeating the dragon by Jean-Vincent L'hermitais (1700-1758). There is also a painting representing the Extreme Unction. Legend states that Saint Pol delivered the Ile de Batz from a dragon which was terrorising the island. He was assisted by a knight from Cl√©der subsequently known as \\"Kergournadec'h\\" based on the fact that he was fearless (\\"il ne recule pas\\"/\\"He did not flinch\\"). Amongst the items kept in the cathedral sacristy is the \\"√©tole\\" (stole) which legend has it saint Pol put around the dragon's neck and led it towards the sea. Also against the lateral wall of the choir is the gisant of Monseigneur Guillaume de Kersauzon. This stucco 19th-century gisant marks the tomb of Guillaume de Kersauzon who died in 1327.

Saint Apollonia was one of a group of virgin martyrs who suffered in Alexandria during a local uprising against the Christians prior to the persecution of Decius. According to legend, her torture included having all of her teeth violently pulled out or shattered. For this reason, she is popularly regarded as the patroness of dentistry and those suffering from a toothache or other dental problems. In the statue, she holds a pair of pinchers to remind us of her martyrdom. By the statue of sainte Apollonia is a statue of saint Anthony (Anthony the Great) with his pig.

Each lancet has a descriptive inscription \\"NATIS EST HODIE SALVATOR ; NUNC DEMITTIS SERVUM TUUM DOMINE ; EGO SUM PANIS VITAE ; SURREXCIT SICUT DIXIT\\". The window also carries the coats of arms of the Rodellec family crossed with those of Poulpiquet and Rodellec crossed with those of Relas. It also bears the motto \\"MAD HA LEAL\\".

The \\"Songe de St-Pol\\" altar (8 ,9 and 10)  The altarpiece, dating to the 19th century, is wooden and has bas-reliefs as decoration, that on the left representing the \\"Dream of Saint Pol\\" and that on the right \\"The fisherman discovering the bell\\". To the left of the altar is a plaster statue of Saint Herbot dating to the 20th century and to the right is another plaster statue this depicting Saint Eloi. In the centre is a third plaster statue representing Notre-Dame des Sept- Douleurs, this set in part of the wooden altarpiece. This also dates to the 20th century. The cathedral has in fact 22 altars, partly due to the fact that it serves the seven parishes of Minihy, At one time the number was far higher, and an excess of altars and statues was making it difficult for people to navigate freely around the nave, ambulatory and choir. Bishop Jean-Louis Gouyon de Vaudurand issued an edict which had 14 altars removed and forbade the use of 12 others. He also had many statues removed. The content of many of the 22 altars retained were reduced to plain stone altars.  The \\"Icone de Marie\\" altar (13)  This altar made of varnished wood is the work of A.Bizard and dates to 1926. It has an icon on display depicting the Virgin Mary.  Window \\"La Vierge √† l'offrande\\" (15)  This 19th-century stained glass window depicts \\"la Vierge √† l'offrande\\".

The latter contains the skull of saint-Pol along with one of his fingers and a bone from his arm. There are also relics relating to saint Herv√©, saint Lawrence and saint Jo√´vin. There is also a pine needle said to be from the crown of thorns. Nearby is the \\"cloche de Saint Pol\\". There is an enfeu in the chapel which bears the arms of Tr√©z√©guer-Mah√©. In front of the altar is the tomb of Yves de Poulpry, the cantor of the cathedral and the tomb of Chrestien de la Masse. In the area are several tombstones including that of Marie-Amice Picard, the mystic who died in 1652 at the age of 17. The tombstone of Marie-Amice Picard  The Chapelle de Kerautret  The chapel contains a tomb in kersanton bearing the arms of Traonelorn and Kerautret. The same arms can be seen in the chapel vaulting. By the chapel altar is a tombstone marking the grave of Christophe Traonelorn of Kerautret. In the chapel is a fresco representing the last judgement and a plain window bearing the arms of the Gu√©briants. As one enters the chapel and on the left, there is a stoup supported by two angels and bearing the arms of the Traonelorns. The altar is also known as the \\"Autel √† la sir√®ne\\". Finally in the north ambulatory is an 1897 \\"Annunciation\\" group and a fresco depicting the \\"Final Judgement\\".  The north transept  There are various statues in the north transept; a 17th-century wooden statue of saint Joseph, a modern sculpture of Notre-Dame de Lourdes and a 20th-century marble statue of sainte-Th√©r√®se. There is also a 17th-century wooden statue of an unidentified saint and a 16th-century wooden crucifix.  The Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel altar (36)  The Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel altar and altarpiece Carved from wood, polychromed and dating to the 17th century, the altarpiece was placed in the cathedral as recently as 1973. It had originally been in the Convent of the Carmes which was razed to the ground during the French revolution. In the centre of the altarpiece is a statue of the Virgin Mary with child and on the left side of the altar there is a sculpture depicting saint-Rapha√´l with the young Tobias and on the right side a statue of saint Michael slaying the dragon. The altar's bas-reliefs represent the four cardinal virtues, Temperance, Justice, Force and Prudence. In front of the altar balustrade is the tombstone of Fran√ßois Le Veyer of Kerisnel, who had died in 1570 and been one of the officials in charge of the parish of Saint-Pierre which included Roscoff West and Santec. Saint-Pierre was one of the constituent parishes of Minihy-L√©on. In the vaulting here we see the arms of Kerautret, Chavign√© (Monseigneur Christophe de Chavign√© was the L√©on bishop from 1521 to 1554 and he was succeeded by his brother Monseigneur Rolland de Cavign√©, bishop from 1554 to 1562) and Richard. There is also the arms of the Kerguiziau family. There is a large enfeu bearing the arms of the Lesguens. Also in the part of the cathedral where one enters the choir there is an enfeu bearing the arms of Monseigneur Sergeant who was a bishop at Quimper.  Autel du Rosaire (19)  The 17th-century altar and altarpiece is in one of the lateral chapels on either side of the choir. This chapel served the parish of Saint-Jean Baptiste or Saint-Jean de la ville, one of the seven Minihy parishes served by the L√©on bishopric. The altar includes a painting which was acquired by the \\"congr√©gation du Rosaire\\" in 1643 and is a panoramic view of St Pol de L√©on at that time. One can see the famous Carmes convent since destroyed. This panorama is the backcloth to a depiction of the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist showing the city to Christ. In the accompanying altarpiece, 15 small medallions illustrate the \\"myst√®res du Rosaire\\". In front of the altar is the flat grave of Canon Kerguz holding the cantorial baton, the insignia of the cathedral cantor. This chapel holds the three windows which tell of the St Pol legend. Also in this location is the Chapelle du Saint-Sacrament, a place kept for the public to sit quietly in contemplation.

The window was a gift from the Guebriant family.  The north nave   16th-century stained glass window depicting the parable of the \\"Last Judgement\\". Restored by Huchet in 1884 (1)  \\"Le Jugement Dernier\\" The window has just two lancets these depicting a multitude of people milling around having heard Christ's judgement, In the left side lancet are the \\"chosen\\" and in the right side lancet are the \\"damned\\". In panels at the top of each lancet are angels blowing trumpets. Christ appears in a panel at the top of the window. His arms are spread and his feet rest on a globe. Two panels at the base of the window show Saint Roch with a dog and a flock of sheep and a rural scene of further sheep, rocks, a tree, and a small building. The window is one of three 16th-century windows in the cathedral and was restored in the latter part of the 19th century by Hucher et Fils working in conjunction with the Carmel factory in Mans. The window's main inscription reads \\"ET SEPARABIT EOS AB INVICEM SICUT ; PASTOR SEGRETATOVES AB HOEDIS\\" and an inscription lower down the window reads \\"CE VITRAIL A ETE RESTAURE PAR MM HUCHER ET FILS ; FAB. DU CARMEL DU MANS 1884\\". The parable reads: \\"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?' And the king will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.' Then he will say to those at his left hand, 'You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' Then they also will answer, 'Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not take care of you?' Then he will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\\" (Matthew 25:31-46.)  Window. Christ's condemnation and the climb to Golgotha.  Window dates to 1872 and is by Lobin of Tours. It is inscribed at the base \\"SACERDOTES LEON... FRAIRES IN X HOC MATRI... FERUNT DONUM\\". It is part of the \\"Passion du Christ\\" series and depicts Christ's condemnation and the climb to Golgotha. Note Veronica with her veil and Jesus struggling to carry the cross.  The choir area  In the choir area are the main altar with its extraordinary ciborium, the carved oak stalls, the \\"skull boxes\\" and six tombs, on the north side those of Monseigneur de Gu√©briand, Monseigneur de Rieux-Sourd√©ac and Monseigneur Jean-Fran√ßois de la Marche this by L. Cugnot, and on the south side Monseigneur de Visdelou, Monseigneur Roland de Neufville and Monseigneur Guillaume de Kersauzon  The main altar and the ciborium  Carved from black Mouroux marble, the altar was commissioned in 1746 from the Mans architect Henry Villars. Surrounded by two angels the altar has a ciborium which hangs from a carved wooden replica of a palm tree symbolising \\"Victory\\" and the \\"Resurrection\\". This palm tree is between 5 and 6 metres high and is richly decorated with wheat ears, vine leaves and grapes. The palm tree dates to around 1820 to 1823. There are three similar ciboriums in France, at Amiens, Reims and Saint-Germain. Behind the altar is an elaborate tabernacle. Behind the main altar is a carved 16th-century granite altar decorated with trefoil arches and the arms of Hamon Barbier. There is also an elaborate tabernacle in gilded bronze. The ciborium. The ciboire itself rests in the flower of the palm tree. The trunk is decorated with cherubs. The remains of saint Pol are said to be buried at the foot of the main altar under a black marble plaque whose original inscriptions were mutilated during the French revolution, The modern inscription reads \\"Sepulcrum-sanct Pauli- Civilatis-Leonensium pontificis etvpatroni-obit anno DLXX.\\" Beyond the main altar is a small armoire with the coat of arms of Monseigneur de Keracret. The upper part of the choir is enclosed by a balustrade in kersanton stone. To the right of the main altar is a double credence. In the choir vaulting are the coats of arms of Monseigneur Ferron who was the Bishop of L√©on from 1430 to 1472, the arms of du Chastel, the arms of Monseigneur Validire the Bishop of L√©on from 1427 to 1432, the arms of Rohan, the arms of the town of Saint- Pol- de-Leon and the K√©r√©nee of Minihy.  Stalls  Examples of carvings in the stalls In the Middle Ages, religious wood carving played an important role in ecclesiastical architecture and those in the cathedral date to the 16th century. There are 33 stalls on each side of the choir, 17 in the higher range and 16 lower down and each has been carved with a variety of depictions with representations of foliage, strange animals, dragons and amusing subjects. The first stall on the epistle side bears the arms of Bishop Monseigneur Carman, the Bishop of L√©on from 1504 to 1514 and the first stall on the gospel side bears the arms of Bishop Monseigneur Guy Le Clerc, the Bishop of L√©on from 1514 to 1523. View of the choir area with the master altar and ciborium with angels on either side in the distance and the rows of stalls on either side. Note the elaborately carved canopies above the stalls Behind the row of stalls on the northern side of the choir are a collection of skull boxes.  Skull boxes (39)  Called \\"Les Etag√®res de la nuit\\", these wooden \\"skull boxes\\" or \\"bo√Ætes √† cr√¢ne\\" are kept behind a grill in the cathedral's ambulatory. Each box holds a skull and the box is inscribed with the name of the person to whom the skull belonged. The box takes the form of a small chapel surmounted by a cross with a trefoil shaped opening. At one time these \\"skull boxes\\" were common in Brittany and it was the practice up until the 19th century to remove skeletons from the cemetery after they had been buried for 5 years in order to create space for new remains. The bones were placed in the ossuary or charnel house but the skulls were passed to the deceased's family and many chose to have the skull placed in these chapel shaped boxes and kept on display. The skulls seen on the shelves come from all classes of society from a baker, a health inspector, an infant aged only 6 and a priest to Hamon Barbier the archdeacon of K√©m√©n√©dilly who owned the famous Kerjean ch√¢teau.

It is said that in the design of the organ, Robert was influenced by the organ his father Thomas had built at Cambridge. Dallam had presented himself to the Quimper chapter in 1643 and explained to them that he was a refugee from religious persecution in England. Dallam was given several commissions in Finist√®re.

Jean Budes de Gu√©briand worked as a missionary in China.  Gisant of Monseigneur de Rieux-Sourd√©ac (22)  Gisant of Monseigneur de Rieux-Sourd√©ac This gisant is carved from kersanton stone. Monseigneur de Rieux-Sourd√©ac was a Bishop of Leon who died in 1651. De Rieux-Sourd√©ac wears a bishop's robe and mitre and two angels hold the cushion on which he rests his head.

This tomb carved from Carrara marble is the work of L√©on Cugnot. Cugnot's sculpture depicts the bishop tendering a letter to the National Convention, proposing that he take the place of priests who had been put in prison. His request was ignored, but he never ceased to protest against both the Republic and the Empire. He ignored the Concordat of 1801 issued by Pope Pius VII, which set out to regulate relationships between France and the Holy See. Monseigneur de La Marche introduced the potato to L√©on and became known as the \\"Bishop of potatoes\\". Before entering the church he served in the Queen's Dragoons as a lieutenant and was injured at the battle of Plaisance in 1746. After the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, he left the army and took orders. In 1764 he became the abbot of Saint-Aubin-des-Bois, and was made the Bishop of L√©on in 1772. In 1791 unable to accept the diktats of the Revolution he fled to London and became an \\"√©migr√©\\". He was never to return to France and from a house at 10, Little Queen Street in Bloomsbury, he was to organise help for other dissident clerics anxious to escape France. He died in London in 1806 at the age of 77 and his remains were taken to France in 1868. It was de la Marche who donated funds to Saint-Pol-de-L√©on to cover the cost of a college built under the direction of the architect Robinet and a large seminary. The sculpture for this tomb was shown by Cugnot at the Paris salon of 1867. De la Marche's coat of arms also appear on his tomb and the front of the college he had founded.  The tomb of Monseigneur Fran√ßois de Visdelou (33)  The tomb of Monseigneur Fran√ßois de Visdelou This white marble tomb, located in the choir area of the cathedral, is that of Monseigneur Fran√ßois de Visdelou. It is the work of the sculptor Nicolas de la Colonge and was executed in 1711. Fran√ßois de Visdelou was the confessor of Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV. The gisant depicts de Visdelou reclining on a couch. The monument was saved from total destruction during the Revolution although the coat of arms was chiselled away and a finger of his right hand bearing his ring was also broken off. Fran√ßois de Visdelou was the Bishop of L√©on from 1662 to 1668. There are two inscriptions on the tomb. One reads \\"Franciscus. Visdelou. Leon. epus.et.comes.Annae Austriacae.Gal.reginae conclonator. et eps.Madurae.Dein.epi.Consop.coadjuter. demun.leonem.eps et comes. Obit XV!!! mart.an.MDCLXXI\\" and the second inscribed on the mitre reads \\"NICOLAS DE LA COLONGE MDCCXI\\". In the vaulting near Visdelou's tomb is the coat of arms of the Rious of Kerangouez and their motto \\"Quitte ou double\\". The window here represents Monseigneur De Rieux. It is positioned above the plaster statue of Saint Pierre. The window here shows De Rieux being reinstated to the Leon episcopacy from which he had been removed. At the bottom of the window is a depiction of the town of St. Pol-de-Leon showing the fortifications, the cathedral and the Kreisker chapel. At the top of the window are the coats of arms of Monseigneur de Neufville, De Kergorlay, whose tomb is located in the chapel, Gu√©raut du Penhoat and Riou de Kerangouez. There is also an altar dedicated to Saint Matthew here and a door leading to the rue de Petit- Clo√Ætre. This door is also known as the Saint Matthew door (\\"Porte Saint- Mahieu\\").  The tomb of Monseigneur Roland de Neufville, Bishop of L√©on 1562 to 1613  Monseigneur Bishop Roland de Neufville's tomb is located on the south side of the ambulatory and there is also a stained glass window in the cathedral honouring his memory.

The inscription reads \\"NEVFVILLE PVISNE DV PLESSIS, BARDOVL, EVESQUE DE LEON L'AN 1562, DECEDE LE 5 FEVRIER 1613\\". The tomb is also decorated with two angels holding a shield (ecusson) bearing the Neufville coat of arms. The window honouring Roland de Neufville. Dating to 1883 the stained glass window is by Lobin working with the Carmel factory in Mans. The likeness of Monseigneur de Neufville is based on an illumination depicting the bishop in a missal held in Lyon. Just by the tomb of Monseigneur de Neufville on the epistle side of the choir there is the tomb of Pierre le Neboux de la Brosse who served as the Bishop of L√©on from 1671 to 1701.  The Tomb of Monseigneur Guillaume de Kersauzon  This tomb is located against the south wall of the choir. It bears the de Kersauzon coat of arms and the inscription: \\"HIC JACET IN PACE GUILLELMUS DE KERSAUZON EPS LEON.QUI.CAPELLAE.SANCTI.MARTINI.IN HAC ECCLESIAE.CATHLI.FUNDAMENTA LOCAVIT OBIIT.A.DNIU.MCCCXXVII.\\" The tomb is carved from white stone, De Kersauzon wears his mitre and his head rests on a cushion. At his feet is a depiction of the St. Pol dragon.

The archdiocese comprises the whole of the department of Tarn, and is itself currently suffragan to the Archdiocese of Toulouse, a metropolitan archdiocese. The current Archbishop of Albi is Jean Legrez, O.P., appointed archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday, 2 February 2011. He formerly served as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Claude in France. In 2015, in the Diocese of Albi there was one priest for every 1,740 Catholics; in 2018, there was one priest for every 2,130 Catholics, a worsening of the situation. History Originally erected around the 5th century as the Diocese of Albi,Compayre, p. 61. DeVic-Vaissete, IV, p. 383 column 1. the diocese was for centuries a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bourges. Growth of Heresy In 1145 The Encyclopedia Britannica article \\"Albigeois\\" Volume 1 (Cambridge 1910), p. 505, gives the date of 1147, which, however, is inconsistent with the known whereabouts of Cardinal Albericus. Pope Eugenius sent Cardinal Albericus, the Bishop of Ostia, to Toulouse as his Legate against the Petrobusian heretics, and Cardinal Albericus took the Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux along with him. Gofridus of Clarivaux, an associate of Bernard, left a highly-colored account of Bernard's work in confuting the Petrobosian leader Henry of Lausanne; after several days of preaching in Toulouse, Bernard caused Henri to flee, but he was quickly captured and turned over to the bishop of Toulouse. Bernard also preached against the Manichaean heretics of the neighborhood, though at the castle-town of Verfeil, some ten miles east of Toulouse, he was completely unsuccessful.Cesare Baronio (ed. Augustin Theiner), Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus XIX (Bar-le-Duc 1870), pp. 3-9. The Cardinal, followed some days later by Bernard, then visited Albi. The Cardinal's reception was cold and jeering, reflecting no doubt the well-known anti-clerical attitudes of the Albigensians, in particular the luxury and arrogance of the higher clergy. Bernard's reception was more friendly, his reputation as an ascetic and celibate approximating the Albigensian view of \\"the good men\\". He was favorably received in his sermon in the Cathedral on 29 June, and, at least in his own imagination, he persuaded large numbers to return to the true and orthodox faith. His companion and biographer, Geoffrey of Auxerre, was less certain, an evaluation which appeared more realistic in the outcome. Geoffrey also wrote to the monks at Clairvaux that Bernard's return should be expected some time after the Octave of the Assumption (the last week of August). The Cardinal was back with the Pope in time for Christmas in Rome.De Vic and Vaissete, Histoire generale de Languedoc Tome III (Toulouse 1872), p. 745-746. In 1147, while he was still on his journey to France, Pope Eugene III received reports, charges that Bishop Gilibertus of Poitiers was guilty of heresy; the information was brought by two of Gilibertus' own Archdeacons. Gilibertus was summoned to answer to the charges. As the two Archdeacons were returning to France, they consulted with the well-known Cistercian monk, Bernard of Clairvaux, who became eager to help them in bringing Gilibertus to account. The Bishop was examined first at Auxerre, then in Paris (April‚ÄìJune), and finally at the Council of Reims in March 1148. In 1165 a judicial meeting was assembled by Bishop Guillaume de Dorgne of Albi at the castle-town of Lombers, two leagues (c. 10 miles) south of Albi, a place agreed upon by the \\"good men\\" (boni homines) of the Vaudois, where they believed they would be safe under the protection of the knights who held the castle in fief. The \\"good men\\" were under suspicion of heresy, and they were expected to answer the charges against them.Pilar Jimenez, \\"Sources juridiques pour l'etude du catharisme: les actes du concile de Lombers (1165),\\" Clio & Crimen no. 1 (Durango ES, 2014), p. 358-372. The Bishop fortified his court with a large assembly of notables: the Archbishop of Narbonne and the Bishops of Agde, Lod√®ve, N√Æmes, and Toulouse; the Abbots of S. Pons, Castres, Sendrac, Saint-Guilham, Gaillac, Candeil, and others; the Provosts of Toulouse and of Albi; the Archdeacons of Narbonne and Agde; Countess Constance of Toulouse, Trincavel the Vicomte of B√©ziers, and the Vicomte of Laurac; and practically the entire population of Albi and Lombers. Bishop Gaucelinus of Lod√®ve, who acted as inquisitor, had six topics concerning the theological doctrine and practices of the \\"good men\\" on which he interrogated them closely, sometimes in fact engaging in debate. The \\"good men\\" refused to use or respond to arguments or texts from the Old Testament. They were reluctant to discuss the eucharist (though they admitted that any good man, cleric or layman could consecrate), marriage, or penance (They would only say that the sick could confess to anyone they wanted). Crozes, pp. 58-59. In return, the \\"good men\\" accused the prelates of being guilty of unchristian greed and luxury, lupi rapaces, and they named Bishop William a heretic. Bishop Gaucelinus pronounced sentence on the \\"good men\\" as heretics, and offered them an oath of purgation in which they could demonstrate their orthodoxy. They refused. Bishop Guillaume could not bring himself to compel them to swear, or to impose a penalty, since there was considerable support among the people for their cause. Thereafter the \\"good men\\" were called Albigensians.Crozes, p. 59. In 1167 the Albigensians were numerous and confident enough that they held their own Council at Saint-Felix- de-Caraman. A Bogomil bishop Nicetas, and Marcus, a representative of the Lombard community, were present. This council defined the geographical span of the Albigensian Bishoprics of Agenais, Toulouse, Albigeios and Carcasses (Carcassonne). The Albigensian bishop of Albi, Sicard Cellarier, took part.Bernard Hamilton, \\"Cathar Links with the Balkans and Byzantium,\\" , at 141-144. In 1179 Pope Alexander III summoned a general council of the Church, which met in Rome at the Lateran Basilica beginning on 5 March, and came to be called the Third Lateran Council. The 27th Canon of the Council addressed the heresies which were to be found in Gascony, the Albigeois, and Toulouse (in Gasconia, Albegesio, et partibus Tolosanis, et aliis locis) under the names Cathars, Patrines, Publicani, and other names. Anathemas were hurled against them, forbidding anyone to favor or to do business with them in their homes or on their properties.C. J. Hefele, Histoire des conciles (tr. Delarc) Tome VII (Paris 1872) pp. 509-510. In 1180 Pope Alexander appointed Cardinal Henri de Marsiac, who had once been Abbot of Clairvaux and who had been promoted Bishop of Albano at the Lateran Council, to serve as Legate in France against the Albigensians. In June 1181 he led a body of knights against the town of Lavaur, which served as the headquarters of the Cathar bishop of Toulouse. The Cardinal also held councils at Le Puy, Bazas, Limoges, Bourges and Bordeaux. He returned to Rome only after the death of Pope Alexander.Hefele, p. 514. Michael D. Costen, The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade (Manchester 1997), pp. 105-106. Cardinal Henri missed the Conclave of 1181. Albigensian Crusade The Vicomt√© d'Albi was united with the crown by King Louis VIII in 1226, during his visit to the Albigeois in October.Compayr√©, p. 8, 270. Julien Th√©ry-Astruc (2016), \\"The Heretical Dissidence...\\", p. 103. In 1275 the Dominicans held their General Chapter meeting in Perpignan. At that meeting they took the decision to establish a convent of Dominicans in Albi, and they sent eight members of the Order to undertake the task. In the next year the establishment opened, with Bernard Bociat elected the first Prior Conventual. The first stone of their church, Saint-Louis, was laid by Bishop de Castenet in 1293.Compayr√©, p. 58. On 6 March 1474, King Louis XI of France by patent letters granted Bishop Louis d'Amboise and his successors the Presidency of the Three Estates of Languedoc, which included the lands of Perpignan and Roussillon, as well as the Bordelais and Guienne.Compayr√©, pp. 85‚Äì87. Archbishopric On 3 October 1678, Pope Innocent XI, in the Bull Triumphans pastor aeternus, raised the diocese to the status of a metropolitan archbishopric. The Province was composed of the dioceses of Albi, Rodez, Castres, Cahors, Vabres, and Mende.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, Instrumenta, p. 1-3. Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 75 note 1. The bull was confirmed by King Louis XIV in letters patent dated 14 June 1680.Compayr√©, p. 65. Cathedral and canons The canons of the Cathedral Chapter of Albi had once lived under the rule of Saint Augustine, since perhaps the 11th century.DeVic-Vaissete, IV, p. 383 column 1. Bishop Frotardus, at some point before his deposition in 1075, carried out a reform of the cathedral chapter, complaining of the greed, lack of chastity, and neglect of duty of the canons. Most of the canons returned to their duty. The document attesting to the reform mentions two sacristans, capiscolaris (cantor), a treasurer, and a dean. A provost is also mentioned under Frotardus.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, p. 11, and Instrumenta, pp. 5‚Äì6. Compayr√©, pp. 70‚Äì71 Pope Boniface VIII, in a bull of 29 September 1297, secularized the canons. This led to an immediate and intense struggle between the bishop, Bernard de Castanet, and the canons of the cathedral chapter over the redistribution of the property and rights which had belonged to the monks of the monastery. Prebends had to be created, and issues over the rights of presentation to various churches and priories (which ones were to belong to the bishop, and which to the canons) had to be settled. The hostility that grew out of this situation certainly influenced the attempt in 1307‚Äì1308 to have Bishop de Castenet deposed by the pope. The cathedral chapter was composed of seven dignities (not dignitaries) and twenty canons. The dignities were: the provost, the cantor, the succentor, the three archdeacons, and the theologian. Their prebends were granted by the bishop.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, p. 2. In 1678 there were eight dignities, twenty canons, and forty-eight prebends.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 75 note 1. In 1747 there were nine dignities and twenty canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 73 note 1. There was also a collegiate church in Albi, the Church of Saint-Salvi, which was also served by a college of canons, at least since the mid-eleventh century. The canons, twelve in number, followed the rule of Saint Augustine, and were headed by a provost. The provost was elected by the canons and confirmed by the bishop, and had the right to confer all the benefices that belonged to the collegiate church.J.-L. Biget, \\"Sainte-C√©cile et Saint-Salvi: chapitre de cath√©drale et chapitre de coll√©giale √† Albi,\\" Cahiers de Fanjoux 24 (1989) 65-104. Sainte- Marthe, Gallia christiana I, pp. 49-52. The Coll√®ge of Albi was established on 19 May 1623 by Bishop Alphonse d'Elb√®ne and provided with an endowment of 3,000 livres. The Seminary of Albi was erected by the first Archbishop, Hyacinthe Serroni, in 1684.DeVic-Vaissete, IV, p. 383 column 2. Revolution In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decided to bring the French church under the control of the state. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called 'd√©partements', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. Since there were more than 130 bishoprics at the time of the Revolution, more than fifty dioceses needed to be suppressed and their territories consolidated. Clergy would need to take an oath of allegiance to the state and its constitution, specified by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and they would become salaried officials of the state. Both bishops and priests would be elected by special 'electors' in each department. This brought schism, since bishops would no longer need to be approved (preconised) by the papacy; the transfer of bishops, likewise, which had formerly been the exclusive prerogative of the pope in canon law, would be the privilege of the state; the election of bishops no longer lay with the Cathedral Chapters (which were all abolished), with other responsible clergy or the pope, but with electors who did not have to be Catholics or Christians. A new civil department, called \\"Tarn\\", was created by the French Legislative Assembly. The old diocese of Albi was suppressed, and a new \\"Diocese of Tarn\\" was created, with its center at Albi. It was assigned as a suffragan to the \\"Metropole du Sud\\". Archbishop Fran√ßois-Joachim de Bernis of Albi refused to take the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and therefore his See was declared by the Legislative Assembly to be vacant. Cardinal de Bernis died on 2 November 1794. His nephew and coadjutor succeeded to the diocese canonically, receiving the pallium on 1 June 1795. He did not actually resign canonically, however, until 2 March 1802.Bernis was appointed Archbishop of Rouen on 27 September 1819, and died on 4 February 1823. Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 73 notes 4 and 5. The electors of Tarn, meeting at Castres on 13 March 1791, chose in his place Jean-Joachim Gausserand, who was a beneficier of the Cathedral Chapter of Albi and promoter forain of the district of Gaillac. He had been elected a deputy to the Estates General of 1789, and had taken the constitutional oath on 27 December 1790. He was consecrated a Constitutional Bishop in Paris at Notre Dame on 3 April 1791 by Constitutuonal Bishop Antoine-Adrien Lamourette. The consecration was valid, but canonically irregular, schismatic, and blasphemous (as a parody of genuine Catholic sacraments). Gausserand took possession of the diocese of Tarn on 1 May 1791. When religion was formally abolished in 1793 and replaced by the Cult of Reason, the bishop went into hiding, and his diocese was abolished; but, after the Terror, when it was restored, he found that more than 200 of his priests had resigned, and 40 of them had married. Gausserand held three synods in the diocese, in 1797 and 1801. He refused the opportunity to reconcile at the time of the Concordat of 1801. In 1808 he was struck with the interdict and he died in exile in Toulouse on 12 February 1820, without having been reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church. Bourbon restoration After the signing of the Concordat of 1801 with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, Pope Pius VII demanded the resignation of all bishops in France, in order to leave no doubt as to who was a legitimate bishop and who was a Constitutional imposter. He then immediately abolished all of the dioceses in France, for the same reason. Then he began to restore the old Ancien Regime dioceses, or most of them, though not with the same boundaries as before the Revolution, but instead taking account of the abolition of the Estates and Provinces and the creation of the new department system of civil government. The diocese of Albi was not one of those revived by Pope Pius VII in his bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November 1801. The territory of the former diocese of Albi was assigned to the diocese of Montpellier, which also received the territories of the suppressed dioceses of Agde, Lavaur, Narbonne, Saint-Pons, and Vabres. Following the Concordat of 11 June 1817, the archdiocese was restored in 1822 to its former borders and title. During the First World War, 349 members of the clergy of the diocese of Albi were mobilized. Seventeen died, six won the L√©gion d'honneur, three won the Medaille militaire, and sixty-three were awarded the Croix de guerre. 20th and 21st centuries In February 1922, the name was changed to its current designation: the Archdiocese of Albi-Castres-Lavour. In May 2018, the parishes in the diocese of Albi were completely restructured to take account of the severe decline in the number of priests and of communicants. From the traditional number of 523 parishes, 21 \\"new parishes\\" were formed by Archbishop Jean Legrez. Bishops and Archbishops To 1000 : ClairClair is a name in the Proprium diocesis Auscitanensis, a list of diocesan Mass commemorations for June 1; the name also occurs in Bordeaux, Auch, Limoges, Perigueux, Sarlat, and Lectoure. A church was named after him. De Vic- Vaissete, Histoire de Languedoc IV, p. 383. Crozes, pp. 8‚Äì18, provides an extensive treatment of the legend, and the objections to its authenticity. For the legend, see: : AnthimiusDe Vic-Vaissete, IV, p. 383, states: \\"Antime √©tait disciple de S. Clair & passe pour avoir √©t√© son successeur.\\" (Antime was a disciple of S.

It begins with the performer standing up straight with arms raised and positioned near to the ears. The performer then lunges forward and quickly raises one leg, with the other leg following as if transitioning to a handstand. The legs are held straight in a split as they travel overhead. The back is then arched until the leading foot touches the floor, such that the performer is briefly in a back bridge position. After the trailing foot reaches the floor, the performer returns to a standing position. In gymnastics, a front walkover typically ends with one foot extended in front and arms raised. Front walkovers are performed in various activities, including acro dance, circus, and gymnastics.

Both are relays of ADS-10 in Adelaide, and brand as WIN SA, along with some occasional uses of the branding of its affiliated network as Ten SA. Before 2004, SES was the only commercial television station broadcasting in Mount Gambier and the southeast of South Australia. The SES studios were located on John Watson Drive, Mount Gambier. RTS was the only commercial television station in the Riverland region of South Australia, with its studio on Murray Bridge Road, Loxton. Both stations broadcast a mixture of programs derived from the Seven Network, Nine Network, and Network Ten. The 2004 introduction of sole Network Ten affiliate, MGS and LRS, was the second commercial television station in the region - following this, SES/RTS became a sole Nine Network affiliate (until September 2007), only sports programs (particularly AFL matches) were acquired from the Seven Network. At 9:00 a.m. on 15 December 2010, WIN Ten's analog signal was switched off, along with SES/RTS. The channels WIN SA, WIN Nine, and WIN Ten were renamed Seven SA, WIN SA and Ten SA.

Earlier origins consist of outdoor groups during the French Revolution and later which performed as \\"Gardes Fran√ßaises\\" during civic occasions. Composers Charles Simon Catel (1773‚Äì1830) and Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec (1734‚Äì1829) are considered the godfathers of the band. The band can also take its origins back to 1800, the beginnings of the Pr√©fecture de Police of Paris. The Code Napoleon of the time called for a drum roll to announce the police commissioner‚Äôs warning that weapons might be necessary during disturbances. A predecessor band was the \\"7th Arrondissement Musical Union\\" formed in 1919 by a Sergeant Martin. This gathered musicians from two Arrondissements of Paris, the 18th and 19th. La Musique des Gardiens de la Paix from 1929 was conducted by Jules Bleu and Denis Roussel. The band was dissolved in 1942 during the occupation. A resistance network organized by the band was headed by Andre Houillier (bass clarinet). Three band members died in the resistance: George Provost (tuba), Philippe Chevrier (tuba) and Philippe Sitterlin (bugle). After the liberation of Paris, La Musique des Gardiens de la Paix performed the formerly banned national anthem La Marseillaise at the main courtyard of the prefecture of police on August 24, 1944. Conductors from 1945-1999 have included Felix Coulibeuf, D√©sir√© Dondeyne, Claude Pichaureau, Fran√ßois Boulanger, Louis Tillet, and Philippe Ferro. The 122 musicians, as of 2015, offer over 100 concerts annually in the Paris area and abroad. Members are recruited from the national academies, and must be both musicians and policemen. The conductor since July 2014 is Gildas Harnois. The band has released a large repertoire of music from three centuries on the Calliope, Club Fran√ßais du Disque, Erato, Music Guild, Nonesuch, Teldec, and Westminster labels.

The ad carried a picture of bin Laden and the logo of al-Qaeda's media production company As-Sahab. An accompanying translated message read: \\"Soon, with the permission of God, a new visual tape, the Sheikh, the Lion, Osama bin Laden. May God protect him.\\" The timing of the video's release coincided with the 6th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States. bin Laden's previous appearance in a video was in 2004. By September 7, 2007, United States authorities had obtained a copy of the video, even though it hadn't been officially released. Soon after, the Reuters news agency released a 1-minute excerpt of the tape, which it had obtained from BNO News. Contents Note: The following description was compiled after consideration of the video and transcript as hosted by The Counterterrorism Blog In the video, bin Laden is seated at a table wearing a white robe, turban, and beige cloak. His beard is shorter than in his 2004 video and it's black, leading some to speculate that it had been dyed. The video's title \\"The Solution\\" appears in the top left corner of the video frame. The video running time is approximately 26 minutes. Bin Laden addresses the \\"People of America\\" directly in the video, but he makes no direct threats to the United States. He criticizes perceived flaws in American society and US foreign policy, contrasting these with the perceived virtues of Islam. The September 11 attacks are mentioned several times, as is the Iraq War. The video concludes with a suggestion that Americans should convert to Islam. Other events and themes in the video include: * The 62nd anniversary of the US Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki * The influence of the Democratically-controlled congress * The influence of major corporations * Global warming and the Kyoto Accord * The war in Afghanistan * The Dissolution of the Soviet Union * The Kennedy Assassination * The Vietnam war * The extermination of Native American Indians * The Spanish Inquisition * The Capitalist / Communist governments who \\"take their people for fools\\" Individuals mentioned in the video include: * Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair * Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown * Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy * Author and political activist Noam Chomsky * Author and former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer He suggests that the viewer read the European thinker who anticipated the fall of the Soviet Union.

The soldier's comments were made in an ABC News story dated July 16, 2007, and although Bin Laden attributes the remarks to Corporal Joshua Lake who appears in the story.ABC News transcript of video. Questions concerning authenticity Several peculiarities in the video raise questions regarding its authenticity: * Osama bin Laden sports the trimmer, blacker beard and the same clothing he wore in the October 2004 video.Researcher: Bin Laden's beard is real, video is not Tech news blog ‚Äì CNET News.com * All references to current events, such as the 62nd anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Japan, and Sarkozy and Brown being the leaders of France and the UK, respectively, occur when the video is frozen. Reaction to the video President George W. Bush speaking from the APEC Summit in Sydney, Australia: : The tape is a reminder of the dangerous world in which we live and it is a reminder that we must work together to protect our people. : In the same speech: : I found it interesting that on the tape Iraq was mentioned, which is a reminder that Iraq is part of the war against extremists. If Al-Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it's because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq, which is to drive us out. Homeland Security Advisor Frances Townsend speaking to Fox News Sunday: : Remember, the last audiotape was in June of '06. The last video was just before the election in October of '04. This is about the best he can do. This is a man on the run, from a cave, who is virtually impotent other than these tapes. Expert on Islamic issues Sliman Abu Rahman (based in Amman, Jordan) speaking to Al Jazeera: : In his earlier speeches he offered them a truce and now he is asking them to convert. I think this is very far from reality and no political organizing with realistic political objectives can have such an unacceptable political discourse.Al Jazeera coverage, September 2007. Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer speaking to Wolf Blitzer, anchor of CNN's The Situation Room: : Inherent in his request for us to convert (to Islam) is a very explicit threat that he is going to attack us in a very hard way. The prophet told Muslims before you attack anyone you warn them, offer them a chance to convert and offer them truces.CNN: The Situation Room, September 2007. Scheuer also provided a more detailed analysis at the Jamestown Foundation site.The Jamestown Foundation Security analyst M.J. Gohel of the Asia-Pacific Foundation speaking to The Washington Post: : This has the language and hallmarks of Adam Gadahn and is very reminiscent of his own messages in terms of style and content. Second video On September 11, 2007, a second video appeared, purportedly featuring a eulogy by Osama bin Laden for 9/11 hijacker Waleed al-Shehri. In the video, a voice identified as bin Laden's delivers a 14-minute introduction. The voice is heard over a still picture of bin Laden, dressed and groomed as he appears in the September 7, 2007 video. The 33-minute balance of the recording is a video will read by al-Shehri.

Photograph taken with a 3 diopter achromatic close-up lens: Pentatomidae-hatchlings underneath a purple beech leaf In photography, a close-up lens (sometimes referred to as close-up filter or a macro filter) is a simple secondary lens used to enable macro photography without requiring a specialised primary lens. They work like reading glasses, allowing a primary lens to focus more closely. Bringing the focus closer allows the photographer more possibilities. Close-up lenses typically mount on the filter thread of the primary lens, and are often manufactured and sold by suppliers of photographic filters. Nonetheless, they are lenses and not filters. Some manufacturers refer to their close-up lenses as diopters, after the unit of measurement of their optical power. Close-up lens do not affect exposure, unlike extension tubes, which also can be used for macro photography with a non-macro lens. Optical power Close-up lenses are often specified by their optical power in diopters, the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. For a close-up lens, the diopter value is positive: the bigger the number, the greater the effective magnification. Several close-up lenses may be used in combination; the optical power of the combination is the sum of the optical powers of the component lenses. For example, a set of lenses of +1, +2, and +4 diopters can be combined to provide a range from +1 to +7 in steps of 1. Working distances and magnifications Close-up lenses change both the maximum and minimum focus distances of a lens. The range can be rather small. Working at maximum distance Adding a close-up lens to a lens focused to infinity changes the focus point to the focal length of the close-up lens, that is, the inverse of its optical power. This is the combination's maximal working distance: That distance is sometimes given on the filter in mm. A +3 close-up lens has a maximal working distance of 0.333m or 333 mm. The magnification is the focal distance of the objective lens (f) divided by the focal distance of the close-up lens; i.e., the focal distance of the objective lens (in meters) multiplied by the diopter value (D) of the close-up lens: = f D |cellpadding |border}} In the example above, if the lens has a 300 mm focal distance, the magnification is . Given the small size of most sensors (about 25mm for APS C sensors) a 20mm insect will almost fill the frame at this magnification. Using a zoom lens makes it easy to frame the subject as desired. Working at minimal distance When you add a close-up lens to a camera which is focusing at the shortest distance at which the objective lens can focus, the focus will move to a distance which is given by following formula: X being the shortest distance at which the objective lens can focus (in meters), and D being the diopter value of the close-up lens. This is the minimal working distance at which you will be able to take a picture with the close-up lens. For example, a lens that can focus at 1.5m combined with a +3 diopter close-up lens will give a closest working distance of . The magnification reached in those conditions is given by following formula: = M_X (D X + 1) |cellpadding |border}} MX being the magnification at distance X without the close-up lens. In the example above, the gain of magnification at Xmin will be . It is at this Xmin distance that you will get the highest magnification. Macro photography with a close-up lens Close-up lenses can make a telephoto lens function as a macro lens with a large working distance. This is useful, for example, to prevent scaring small animals or isolating the subject from messy surroundings. To use the filters for animals the size of the animal will determine the working distance (small snakes 1m to 50 cm, lizards 50‚Äì25 cm, small butterflies, beetles 25‚Äì10 cm), so it is essential to know what will be the favorite subject before screwing on a close-up lens. The close-up lenses are most effective with long focal length objectives and using a zoom lens is very practical to have some flexibility in the magnification. A good technique for sharp focussing is to take a picture at a long focal length first to have optimal sharpness at the essential details and then zooming out to have the desired size in the frame. Optical issues Some single-element close-up lenses produce images with severe aberrations but there are also high-quality close-up lenses composed as achromatic doublets which are capable of producing excellent images, with fairly low loss of sharpness.

Brown began his career as a full-back for Hull City, before moving on to Lincoln City. Soon after, Brown moved on to Cambridge City. Soon after, he was offered a full-time coaching position at Oxford United. After six years as a coach, and following the departure of Gerry Summers to Gillingham, Brown was offered the manager's job at Oxford, a position he held for a further four years. Despite having limited success with the Us, Brown impressed enough to be offered a job at West Bromwich Albion as Ron Atkinson's assistant. When Atkinson was signed by Manchester United in 1981, he was followed by Brown soon after. The two had a successful spell together at Old Trafford, winning two FA Cups in 1983 and 1985, as well as reaching the final of the League Cup in 1983. In addition, the team never finished below fourth in the league in Brown's time there. However, in November 1986, Atkinson was dismissed by United. His replacement, Alex Ferguson, brought his own assistant manager with him, and Brown was no longer required at the club. In 1989, he was signed by Phil Neal as his assistant at Bolton Wanderers. He remained at Bolton for a further three years, until Neal lost his job with the Trotters and Brown followed him out of the exit door. That summer, he took up a coaching post in Pahang, Malaysia, with the Pahang FA. Brown did not stay in Malaysia for very long, and soon returned to England as Coventry City's chief scout. He then took up a similar position at Blackburn Rovers in 1997, but only stayed for one season before moving back to Manchester United. He stayed at United for eight years, before he was forcibly retired by the club, whose policy at the time required all staff over the age of 65 to retire. West Brom re-signed Brown in the summer of 2005, and he stayed there for almost two years before linking up with the former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, at Sunderland, joining fellow United old-boys Neil Bailey, Raimond van der Gouw and Michael Clegg.

The sea surrounding the island is frozen most of the year. Since the limit of permanent ice crosses Belaya Zemlya, it is often difficult to distinguish between land and sea. However, as the cartography of the Franz Josef Archipelago became more accurate, it became apparent that \\"Liv Island\\" was only a peninsula at the western end of Eva Island. Therefore, some maps mention \\"Eva-Liv Island\\", a combination of both names. The bay formed by the isthmus area on the northern side is Bukhta Kapriznaya.

He then served on the county school board from 1986 to 2000, including a seven-year stint as chairman from 1992 to 1999. Kendrick was elected to his final term on the Board in 1998, beating challenger David Hinton 71‚Äì29%. Florida House of Representatives In 2000, when incumbent State Representative Janegale Boyd opted to run for the State Senate rather than seek re-election, Kendrick ran to succeed her in the 10th District, which stretched from Apalachicola to the Tallahassee suburbs in the Panhandle down to outer Gainesville and Ocala in North Central Florida. In the Democratic primary, he faced attorney Joyce Dove, businessman Johnny \\"Hank\\" Hankerson, developer George Johnston, attorney Joseph Lander, Wakulla County Commissioner Murray McLaughlin, and former State Representative Carl Ogden. In the initial primary, no candidate received a majority‚ÄîKendrick won 23% the vote, Hankerson won 21%, Lander won 18%, McLaughlin won 15%, Dove won 11%, Ogden won 9%, and Johnston won 4%. Accordingly, a runoff was held between Kendrick and Hankerson. Despite the closeness of the initial primary, however, Kendrick defeated Hankerson in a rout, receiving 61% of the vote to Hankerson's 39%. In the general election, Kendrick faced Carol \\"Sunny\\" Phillips, state comptroller Bob Milligan's chief lobbyist and the Republican nominee. Despite the district's conservative lean, Kendrick easily defeated Phillips, winning 61‚Äì39%. In 2002, Kendrick faced no opposition in the Democratic primary and was only opposed by Libertarian candidate John McElligott in the general election. Kendrick won in a landslide, beating McElligott 85‚Äì15%. In 2004 and 2006, Kendrick was unopposed for re-election. After winning re-election in 2006, Kendrick announced that he was switching to the Republican Party. He criticized the Democratic Party for taking him for granted, and argued that he would be better able to win state funding for projects in his district as a Republican in the Republican-dominated house. Following his party switch, he was named Chairman of the House Committeeon on Conservation and State Lands. As Chairman, he successfully pushed to increase funding for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission by increasing fees, protected state funding for wildlife preservation, established a program to preserve seagrass by creating seagrass mitigation banks, and backed an effort to restore the Crooked River Light Station's beam. Kendrick also sponsored legislation to provide breakfast to middle school students and successfully pushed to expand the Franklin Correctional Institution in Carrabelle to add a work camp. 2008 campaign for Franklin County Superintendent of Schools On January 25, 2007, Kendrick announced that he would run for Franklin County Superintendent as a Republican. However, he later filed to run for Superintendent without party affiliation, arguing that it would better enable him to win the votes of Democrats and Republicans. He faced off in the general election against School Board member Denise Butler, the Republican nominee, and Nina Marks, the dean of Franklin County High School and the Democratic nominee. After a closely fought race, Kendrick lost to Marks, winning 30% of the vote to Marks's 39%, and narrowly edging out Butler, who placed third with 29% of the vote. After politics After leaving the Florida House in 2008, Kendrick began working as a legislative liaison for the Florida Department of Corrections. In 2015, when Franklin County Supervisor of Elections Ida Cooper Elliott resigned, Kendrick applied to replace her. However, Governor Rick Scott ended up appointing County Commissioner Pinki Jackel instead.

Racaniello (born January 2, 1953 in Paterson, New Jersey) is a Higgins Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is a co-author of a textbook on virology, Principles of Virology. Racaniello has received the Irma T. Hirschl, Searle Scholars, Eli Lilly, Julius Younger and NIH Merit awards. He has also been a Harvey Society Lecturer at Rockefeller University, the Hilleman Lecturer at the University of Chicago, and University Lecturer at Columbia University. He is also the keynote speaker for the American Society for Virology, at its 2018 meeting. Racaniello has served on the editorial boards of scientific journals, including the Journal of Virology, and is a community editor for the open access journal PLOS Pathogens. He also served as the 2015 president of the American Society for Virology and keynote speaker for their 2017 annual meeting.American Society for Virology Education Racaniello graduated from Cornell University in 1974 (BA, biological sciences) and completed his PhD in the laboratory of Peter Palese in 1980, studying genetic reassortment of influenza virus. As a post-doctoral fellow in David Baltimore's laboratory at MIT (1979‚Äì1982), Racaniello used recombinant DNA technology to clone and sequence the genome of the small RNA animal virus poliovirus. Using these tools he generated the first infectious clone of an animal RNA virus. Construction of the infectious clone revolutionized modern virology. Research Racaniello established his own research laboratory at Columbia University in the fall of 1982. The aim of his laboratory is to understand replication and pathogenesis of small RNA animal viruses Picornaviruses. The reproductive cycle of a virus begins with its attachment to and entry into the cytoplasm of a cell. His laboratory identified CD155 (poliovirus receptor, PVR); a cell surface protein, and member of the immunoglobin superfamily as the protein that mediates this process. Understanding how the interaction between virus and cell alters the viral particle and how virus entry is facilitated by the interaction has helped elucidate the means by which poliovirus infection is initiated. Humans are the only known natural host for poliovirus. The study of viral disease is therefore only feasible with the generation of a small animal model. Though not susceptible to poliovirus infection, murine cells do allow for efficient replication of poliovirus RNA introduced into the cytoplasm. Taking advantage of this observation, Racaniello's laboratory constructed the first small animal model of poliomyelitis. Mice producing the human CD155 protein were generated and infected with poliovirus. These mice exhibited all symptoms and pathology of poliomyelitis observed in humans including flaccid paralysis and spinal cord lesions. These mice today are used not only to continue to understand poliovirus pathogenesis but as a means to test the safety of stocks of the polio vaccine. Poliomyelitis is a disease of the central nervous system; however it is believed that CD155 is present on the surface of most if not all cells of the body. An element present within the virus RNA was hypothesized to govern viral tropism which tissues the virus infected. Newborn mice producing PVR were infected with wild-type poliovirus and a chimeric poliovirus in which this element was replaced with the same region from hepatitis C virus, a liver specific virus, or coxsackievirus B3, a virus that infects the heart or meninges. Mice infected with any of these viruses exhibited symptoms of poliomyelitis. Therefore, this region of poliovirus does not determine tissue tropism of the virus. Secretion of interferon is one means the body uses to ward off pathogens including viral diseases. However poliovirus is able to replicate when interferon is added to medium used to culture mammalian cells. Racaniello's laboratory believes that this resistance is dictated by the 2A protein of poliovirus. Racaniello's laboratory continues to investigate how poliovirus circumvents the immune response of the host enhancing our understanding of its pathogenesis and why it is a disease of the central nervous system. Research after poliovirus Even though global eradication of poliovirus was initiated in 1988, and poliovirus infection continues throughout the world today, Racaniello's laboratory has begun to investigate the reproductive cycle and pathogenesis of other picornaviruses similar to poliovirus. These viruses include enteroviruses D68 (EV-D68) and 70 (EV70), human rhinovirus, coxsackievirus A21 and echovirus 1. Infectious clones of EV70 and several serotypes of rhinoviruses were generated. These reagents have been used to understand how host range of a virus can be altered and to identify cellular proteins necessary for replication of the viral RNA. Racaniello has also begun to study how these viruses evade the host innate immune system, in particular Interferon type I response. Infection of cultured cells with human rhinovirus 1A results in the cleavage of the integral component IPS-1 (MAVS, Cardif). In addition a small animal model of virus echovirus 1 pathogenesis has been established. Racaniello is also interested in picornavirus evolution and movement. To this means, he intends to isolate and identify picornaviruses found in the wild throughout the Northeastern United States. Racaniello's laboratory continues to pursue the fundamental principles of virus biology. Together with a long-term collaborator, Racaniello's lab has determined that neurotropism of Zika virus and enterovirus D 68 are not a recently acquired phenotypes. Results from their studies examining Zika virus infection of the neonatal mouse brain revealed that cortical development pathologies associated with virus disease may result from architecture defects of the developing brain. Data from their research understanding the mechanism of enterovirus D68 associated acute flaccid myelitis suggests multiple means by which paralysis may result from virus infection exist . Science beyond the laboratory Understanding that the World Wide Web is a primary scientific tool, Racaniello is one of the co- creators of BioCrowd, a social network designed to bring together scientists of all disciplines. Racaniello's virology blog, and podcasts This Week in Virology, This Week in Parasitism with colleague Dickson Despommier, This Week in Microbiology with Michelle Swanson, Michael Schmidt and Elio Schaechter, This Week in Evolution with Nels Elde Immune with Stephanie Langel and Cynthia Leifer and This Week in Neuroscience also unify science with technology. His blog, podcasts, specialized pages on Influenza 101 and Virology 101 aim to bring microbiology to non-scientists. Continuing to bring virology to those outside of the field, Racaniello established a library containing podcasts of lectures he has recently given at Columbia University.

It presents letters of the alphabet with corresponding words and/or images. Some alphabet books feature capitals and lower case letter forms, keywords beginning with specific letters, or illustrations of keywords. Alphabet books may consist of sentences, paragraphs, or entire pages highlighting letters and corresponding keywords in a variety of creative and imaginative formats. Purposes Alphabet books introduce the sounds and letters of the ordered alphabet. These books provide a non-threatening genre in which children engage in a variety of both fiction and non-fiction texts. Alphabet books provide opportunities for: #Developing conversations and proficiency in oral language #Increasing phonemic awareness #Teaching phonics #Making text connections (Activating prior knowledge) #Predicting (Text talk) #Building vocabulary #Inferencing / drawing conclusions #Sequencing #Identifying elements of story structure #Recognizing point of view #Visualizing setting (Time, place and atmosphere) #Performing Dialogue (Plays and Readers‚Äô Theater) #Rereading for fluency #Retelling for comprehension checks #Engaging Multiple Intelligences through writing, music, art, DanceWhat is an alphabet book at sil.org accessed 9 September 2007 East Slavic textbook. Printed by Ivan Fyodorov in Lviv, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This page features Cyrillic. A page from an alphabet book, showing the letter a and an armadillo History The first page of Abckiria, written by Mikael Agricola in 1543. The oldest alphabet book known is Thomas Petyt's The BAC Bothe in Latyn and in Englysshe (1538). The first alphabet book to be accompanied by pictures is John Hart's A Methode; or, Comfortable Beginning for All Unlearned (1570). Hornbooks The hornbook, a form of ABC book, was common by Shakespeare's day. It consisted of a piece of parchment or paper pasted on a wooden board and protected by a leaf of horn. Hornbooks displayed letters of the alphabet, a syllabary and prayers for novice readers. Andrew Tuer Tuer, A. W. (1896). A history of the horn-book, vols. 1 & 2\\\\. London: Leadenhall Press. described a typical hornbook with a line separating the lower case and capital letters from the syllabary. This syllabarium or syllabary, likely added to the hornbook in 1596, taught pronunciations of vowel and consonant combinations. :ab eb ib ob ub ba be bi bo bu These syllables are possible ancestors to the modern instructional practice of new readers working with onsets and rimes in word families. From the first hornbook, the alphabet format cemented the learning progression from syllables to words. An example of the reliance on the alphabet for reading instruction is found in John Bunyan's, A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhymes for Children.Bunyan, John A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhymes for Children., 1686, London, Printed for N. P. [Nathaniel Ponder]. > : To those who are in years but Babes I bow : My Pen to teach them what the > Letters be, : And how they may improve their A. B. C. : Nor let my pretty > Children them despise. : All needs must there begin, that would be wise, : > Nor let them fall under Discouragement, : Who at their hornbook stick, and > time hath spent, : Upon that A. B. C., while others do : Into their primer > or their Psalter go. As referenced in this verse, it was an expectation of the period that ‚Äúbabes‚Äù began as readers with knowledge of the alphabet. Armed with the letters of the alphabet from the hornbook, children encountered other early forms of reading materials. The child's alphabet book is considered one of the oldest literary genres of American literature. Battledores The battledore was an instrument like a small racket, used for playing badminton. The term was applied to the wooden or cardboard tablets, which gradually replaced the hornbook as a device for teaching children to read. The wording printed on them varied greatly, but usually featured an alphabet, and, unlike the hornbook, entertainment was provided as well as instruction in the form of illustrations. They first appeared in the 1750s and were produced until the middle of the nineteenth century. The battledore was a more complex type of horn book printed on thick paper folded in three parts containing enlarged text with word to object illustrations for each of the capital letters bordering the four sides. The letter-word associations provide insight into eighteenth century religious and sociocultural priorities. :A is represented by an image of an Angel :J Judge :K King :M Mitre (religious Head wear) :Q Queen :T Turk :X Xerxes :Z Zeal (kneeling figure with open prayer book) Tuer's Royal Battledore illustrated the lower case alphabet letters with a for Apple; j, k, q, and x for Judge, King, Queen and Xerxes; m for Mouse and z for Zany jester. In fact, some battledores' upper and lower borders contained this rhyme: > : He that ne'er learns his ABC, : For ever will a Blockhead be. : But he > that learns these Letters fair, : Shall have a Coach to take the Air. There is evidence of a gradual shift to more secular topics for general reading instruction from predominantly religious material. Primers and spellers Experienced with both hornbooks and battledores, children graduated on to the modern concept of a small book, multiple paper pages covered with a thick, protective layer. Early reading booklets or religious primers contained both the alphabet and increasingly complicated lists of alphabetized syllables along with selected excerpts from the Bible. From tablet to booklet, the ABC format served as the most common framework for additional reading materials. The first church primers paralleled the introduction of school textbooks known as ‚Äúthe ABC‚Äù.Smith, N. B. (2002). American reading instruction. Newark, DE: International Reading Association. p. 7 Both colonial primers and ABC spellers employed the alphabet as an organizational feature for literacy instruction and spiritual study. Originally imported from England, children's reading textbooks aligned with the educational emphasis on the alphabet. While students were first trained to recite the alphabet, moralistic readings were framed around the letters of the alphabet. During the American colonial period the more secular ‚ÄúABC‚Äù spellers quickly fell out of favor in comparison with the more religious primers; nevertheless, the alphabet remained the most systematic means of ordering the written contents of schoolbooks. The New England Primer Dating back to 1683, the New England Primer contained rhyming couplets for each letter of the alphabet. These patterned rhymes were often supported by gloomy woodcut illustrations. The content of these paired lines varied from overwhelmingly religious to somewhat secular depending upon the particular version of the New England Primer. The standard Primer beginning 'In Adam's fall, we sinned all' remained consistent throughout the numerous published texts; however, rhymes were occasionally edited for religious or political purposes, as demonstrated by the 1729 edition of the New England Primer. The passage, ‚Äòour KING the good, No man of blood‚Äô illustrated the letter KSmith, N. B. (2002). American reading instruction. Newark, DE: International Reading Association. p. 21-2 Due to the conflict with the English monarchy, The K couplet was altered and appeared in the revised 1777 edition as ‚ÄòProud Korah's troop, was swallowed up.‚ÄôNew England Primer 1777 ed. online Similarly, in the same 1777 version, 'The dog will bite, a thief at night' was replaced by a Biblical reference. 'The deluge drowned the earth around‚Äô was inserted for ‚Äòthe watchful dog‚Äô. Referring to mortal sin, the original U for 'Uriah's beauteous wife made David seek his life‚Äô was censored by omitting U and skipping to V. The alphabet letters were used to teach the moral code aspired by society and religion. In the New England Primer, the couplets were followed by alphabetized Biblical sentences; the ‚ÄúAlphabet of Lessons for Youth‚Äù was designed for further reading practice and lifelong moral instruction. Both the 1777 and 1843 editions of the Primer maintained the same sentence excerpts from the Bible. The following are a few examples highlighting letters A, D, K and U: : A Wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. : DO not the abominable thing which I hate saith the Lord. : KEEP thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. : UPON the wicked, God shall rain an horrible tempest. Clearly, the immensely popular New England Primer continued to influence educational practice even beyond the revolutionary period. Of parallel longevity, the battledore continued to be published well into the 18th century. Believed to be the inventor of battledores in 1746, Benjamin Collins actually printed 100,000 copies between 1771 and 1780(Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books, 1566-1910: a Catalogue, Toronto, Toronto Public Library, 1975, p. 109) Versions of The Child‚Äôs New Plaything Exemplifying the move away from strictly religious texts to more moral works, an outstanding example of the next generation of readers was the 1742 version of The Child‚Äôs New Plaything. Sensitive to a youthful audience, the anonymous author introduced the alphabet with a lettered story about an appetizing apple pie. :A Apple-Pye. :B bit it. :C cut it. :D divided it. :E eat it. :F fought for it. :G got it. :H had it. :I it'd it. :J join‚Äôd for‚Äôt. :K kept it. :L long‚Äôd for‚Äôt. :M mourn‚Äôd for‚Äôt. :N nodded at it. :O open‚Äôd it. :P peep‚Äôd in‚Äôt. :Q quarter‚Äôd it. :R run for‚Äôt. :S snatch‚Äôd it. :T turn‚Äôd it. :U use'd it. :V view‚Äôd it. :W what'd it. :X excite'd it. :Y you'd it. :Z zone it. & I wish I had a Piece of it now in my Hand.Monaghan, E. J. (2005). Learning to read and write in colonial America. Amhurst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press. p. 315) Later versions of the rhyme, now known as the Apple Pie ABC, became more elaborate and diversified. In addition, The Child‚Äôs New Plaything contained the alphabet story, A was an Archer,www.library.sfsu.edu which was also to go through many later editions. Present Today there are many diverse kinds of alphabet books that captivate a reader's interest through alliteration, onomatopoeia, creative narratives, poetry of all kinds, clever three-dimensional illusions, mysterious visual treasure hunts, humor, and curiosity. Electronic alphabet books are now on the market, with various animations and audio features. However, educators have criticised alphabet books for focusing on teaching the names of the letters, which often sound different from the sounds they produce, as interfering with the process of learning to read.

It is based on a partial skeleton found in the Gobi Desert. Mahakala was a small dromaeosaurid (approximately 70 centimeters long (28 in)), and its skeleton shows features that are also found in early troodontids and avialans. Despite its late appearance, it is among the most basal dromaeosaurids. Its small size, and the small size of other basal deinonychosaurians, suggests that small size appeared before flight capability in birds. Description Size compared to a human Mahakala is based on IGM 100/1033, a partial skeleton including skull bones, vertebrae, limb bones, and portions of the pelvis and shoulder girdle. Although this individual was small, comparable in size to Archaeopteryx, Caudipteryx, and Mei, it was close to adulthood. This genus can be distinguished from other paravians (dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and birds) by details of the ulna, thighbone, ilium, and tail vertebrae. Like Archaeopteryx and derived dromaeosaurids, but unlike basal troodontids and other dromaeosaurids, the middle (third) metatarsal was not compressed, suggesting that the uncompressed version was the basal version. It had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe, with an expanded claw. Classification 2009 skeletal reconstruction of Mahakala as a generic deinonychosaur A phylogenetic analysis performed by Turner and colleagues, who described the specimen, found Mahakala to be the most basal known dromaeosaurid. Their results, along with the small size of other theropods found at the base of paravian lineages, suggest that small size was not an innovation of early birds, but a common trait of early paravians; small size would have preceded flight and would not have been a special avian autapomorphy as the result of a size squeeze. Like birds, troodontids and dromaeosaurids were not small throughout their evolutionary history, and showed size increases among several different lineages. Mahakala has a combination of characteristics found among basal troodontids and birds, but lacks some that are present in more derived dromaeosaurids. A study in 2017 found that Mahakala was a member of the enigmatic, basal subfamily Halszkaraptorinae. The cladogram below is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted in 2017 by Cau et al. using updated data from the Theropod Working Group in their description of Halszkaraptor. Paleoecology and paleobiology The paleoenvironment of the Djadokhta Formation is interpreted as having a semiarid climate, with sand dune and alluvial settings. The semiarid steppe landscape was drained by intermittent streams and was sometimes affected by dust and sandstorms, and moisture was seasonal. Animals present included terrestrial turtles and crocodilians, lizards, mammals, and a variety of dinosaurs; aquatic animals like fish were not present. The majority of the fauna was small to medium-sized. Small coelurosaurians are the most diverse dinosaurs, including fellow dromaeosaurid Velociraptor, troodontids Byronosaurus and Saurornithoides, oviraptorids Citipati, Khaan, and Oviraptor, and alvarezsaurs Kol and Shuvuuia; other dinosaurs present included ceratopsians Protoceratops and Udanoceratops, the hadrosaur Plesiohadros, and the ankylosaurid Pinacosaurus. Like other dromaeosaurids, Mahakala would have been a small active predaceous carnivore.

In 1913, Carl Windhoff, Fritz Kater, and he were the FVdG delegates at the First International Syndicalist Congress in London. In 1919, he wrote the FVdG's first post-World War I platform Was wollen die Syndikalisten? Programm, Ziele und Wege der \\"Freien Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften\\" (What do the Syndicalists want? Program, Goals, and Means of the \\"Free Association of German Trade Unions\\"). The program summarized the FVdG's theory: a reaffirmation of the importance of strikes as a vehicle for emancipation and a rejection of the centralized mainstream labor unions. Roche was also a resolute proponent of collaboration with left communists. In late 1918, Rudolf Rocker returned to Germany, in March 1919 he joined the FVdG and started gaining influence. An avowed communist anarchist and follower of Kropotkin, Rocker rejected such close collaboration with Marxists. His growing influence led Roche to leave the Free Workers' Union of Germany, as the FVdG was now known, in 1920 and join the General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). He became the leader of the AAUD in Hamburg. In the mid-1920s he left the AAUD for the Federation of Communist Anarchists of Germany and then re-joined the FAUD. References *. Pg. 104-105, 189. *.

Carrion (June 19, 1948 ‚Äì March 27, 2017), also known as Bong Carrion, was a Filipino politician, who was a governor of the province of Marinduque, in the Philippines. He was born in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, and his grandfather, Juan Morente Nieva, also served as the Governor of Marinduque from 1907 to 1916. In 2011, Carrion was implicated in the assassination of broadcaster Gerry Ortega, although ultimately all charges against him were dismissed. He was married to Filipina singer and politician Imelda Papin. Governor of Marinduque Carrion first became the governor of Marinduque during the 1995 gubernatorial election. He served from 1995 to 1998. It was during his term as governor that the Marcopper mining disaster happened in Boac, Marinduque. Known as one of the largest mining disasters in the Philippines, it was estimated it would take 25 years and 300 million pesos to rehabilitate the area. Carrion unsuccessfully ran for re-election thrice as a member of the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino party, in 1998, 2001, and in 2004. Carrion ran again in 2007 as an independent and successfully won the election, defeating the incumbent Carmencita Reyes. Carrion promised to focus on transforming Marinduque to an eco-tourism spot during his second incumbency as governor, detailing an 8-point Execute Agenda during his State of the Provincial Address. Carrion also spent his second term building infrastructure in the province, through coordinating with baranggay units in the creation of farm-to-market roads, construction of school buildings, and institution of agricultural programs. In 2010, Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez ordered the stoppage of a \\"midnight deal\\" involving allegedly overpriced personal computers worth over P18 million. Carrion denied all charges of overpricing, and that no midnight realignment of funds occurred. He has claimed that the allegations were incorrect and misleading. Carrion served until 2010, but was again unsuccessful in securing the re-election in 2010 and 2013. His final bid for re-election in 2013 was unsuccessful, and he was defeated by Reyes. Assassination of Gerry Ortega On January 24, 2011, Palawan journalist Gerry Ortega was assassinated after finishing his radio show. One of the suspects, Rodolfo Edrad, Jr. confessed shortly after and claimed to be a former bodyguard of Carrion's. In Edrad's confession, he named Carrion and former Palawan governor Joel Reyes as the masterminds of the assassination. Carrion confirmed that Edrad was indeed a former security aide, however, he denied ever talking to him about any plot. Ultimately, the Department of Justice dismissed all charges against him and 5 others implicated in the assassination plot due to lack of sufficient evidence to indict them. Personal life Carrion was married to Filipina singer Imelda Papin, with whom he had one daughter Maria France Imelda Papin Carrion. Maria France graduated as a Bachelor of Mass Communication at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, and is now a paralegal. However, Carrion and Papin had their marriage annulled. Prior to his marriage to Papin, Carrion also had one son, Chino. After his marriage to Papin, Carrion went on to marry Armi Carrion. Carrion had one sister, Maria Rosa \\"Bing Carrion-Buck, who is an author. Death On March 27, 2017, Carrion died in Manila, due to complications arising from lung cancer.

He has also performed as a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Orchestra del Teatro Carlo Felice, Orchestre M√©tropolitain du Grand Montr√©al and with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. In the summer of 2011 Smith made his Bregenzer Festspiele debut, performing the title role in Andrea Ch√©nier. Opera News stated \\"Roy Cornelius Smith has crossed into the dramatic repertoire, his voice darkening and gaining power, but without loss of its inherent sweetness and trumpet-like metallic top. Creating a vivid, charismatic character, Smith excelled in the role's two big arias, particularly an impassioned ringing 'Improviso'\\". His 2012/13 season included new productions of La fanciulla del West and Don Carlo (role debut) at the National Theatre Mannheim, where he will also be heard as Otello, Calaf, Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, and as Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca, and debuts at the Norwegian National Opera as Canio. Last season also included his first Dick Johnson in La fanciulla del West with Lyric Opera of Chicago opposite Deborah Voigt, conducted by Sir Andrew Davis. Claudio Vellutini of Mundoclasico.com stated \\"American tenor Roy Cornelius Smith took over the demanding role of Dick Johnson. He showed remarkable command of the technical challenges of his part and his top register sounded particularly bold and sonorous...At the end of the evening, the audience rewarded him with a standing ovation.\\" Smith also debuted with the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen where he sang Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana, directed by Kasper Holten and Canio in Pagliacci, directed by Paul Curran under the baton of Stefano Ranzani. He also performed Calaf in Turandot with New Orleans Opera opposite Lise Lindstrom and Deutsche Oper in Berlin opposite Maria Guleghina, and Dick Johnson in La fanciulla del West with Nashville Opera.

His highly successful debut as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly with the Vienna Volksoper led to an invitation to sing Calaf in a new Barbe/Doucet production of Turandot for which he received rave reviews. Musical America exclaimed \\"his voice is huge, dusky and Italianate, his phrasing and use of dynamics generous and elegant, his stage presence endearing. 'Nessun dorma', sung sweetly, passionately and thrillingly, stopping the show cold (there is no cadence to the aria in the original score, but the explosive ovation and accompanying 'Bravos!' were so deafening and prolonged, Hager had no choice but to put down the baton).\\" His international debut occurred in 1998 at the prestigious Salzburger Festspiele, where he sang Fatty, the Bookkeeper, in Kurt Weill's Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny. (Available on Kultur DVD/Video with Catherine Malfitano and Dame Gwyneth Jones, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies).

Career Recruited from Casterton Football Club in 1959, he was a strong and intelligent player, with exceptional ball sense and judgement, who worked hard and followed instructions. He played his first match for Richmond's senior side when just 18. For some time he only played intermittently with the seniors ‚Äî playing (at centre-half-back) in Richmond's 1962 Night Football premiership team (Richmond 8.16 (64) d. Hawthorn 9.6 (60)) ‚Äî and, in 1963 and 1964, he was the captain of the Reserves side, winning the Reserves' best and fairest in both years. He did not become a permanent senior player until 1965 (when he was 25); and did not play again in the Reserves until 1967, when he played a couple of matches before returning to the seniors. He played in the 1967 premiership team. Handball Having been drilled in the importance of handball as a promoter of play-on football by the legendary coach and football analyst Len Smith, \\"Bull\\" found his calling as a ruck-rover under new coach Tom Hafey, who had replaced Jack Titus at Richmond in 1966. Although strong, tenacious and persistent, \\"Bull\\" was an inconsistent and unreliable kick, and was far from speedy. It seemed a strategic masterstroke when Hafey encouraged \\"Bull\\" to play ruck-rover, and to rove to the rucks' hitouts (more often than not behind the ruck duel, rather than in front of it), rather than contesting the ball- ups and throw-ins with them, and to hand-pass the ball, rather than kick it, immediately he had it. Anyone who saw \\"Bull\\" develop over 1966, and saw him flourish in 1967 ‚Äî being Richmond's unchallenged best on the ground in the Grand Final, when he played his heart out with a superb display of ruck-roving and handball, until he was replaced early in the last quarter due to severe cramps after having more than 20 \\"possessions\\" ‚Äî and seeing him lurking behind the pack, collecting the hitout, and then making one of his unique looping hand-passes could not fail to identify \\"Bull\\" as the glue that held the whole of Hafey's team together. In 1967 he played in Richmond's first premiership team since 1944 when Richmond beat Geelong 16.18 (114) to 15.15 (105).1967 VFL season#Grand Final Teams After Richmond Halfway through the 1969 season he was released to South Melbourne, and he continued to play with them until the end of 1970. He was also the captain-coach of the East Devonport Football Club and the Irymple Football Club (in 1974). He also served several terms as President of the East Devonport Football Club. He died in 2015, aged 74. Record His football record is impressive: * 1956-1958: Casterton Football Club, 54 games (126 goals) * 1959-1964 and 1967-1969: Richmond Football Club Reserves, 92 games (41 goals), captain 1963, 1964, best and fairest 1963, 1964. * 1959-1969: Richmond Football Club Seniors, 103 games (31 goals), member 1962 Night Football premiership team, 1967 VFL (Day) premiership team * 1969-1970: South Melbourne Football Club Reserves, 11 games (9 goals) * 1969-1970: South Melbourne Football Club Seniors, 11 games (21 goals) * 1971-1973: East Devonport Football Club, captain-coach, 54 games (69 goals) * 1974: Irymple Football Club, captain-coach, 19 games (36 goals) Family Richardson's brother, Rodger, played 36 reserve matches and one senior game for Richmond; he transferred to VFA club Prahran in 1965.
