The film is set in the future where after a nuclear holocaust, survivors battle each other over the remaining water in the world. Plot After nuclear war has defoliated the Earth, the survivors live in colonies in a endless quest for drinkable water. A young woman named Delha is on the run from the evil warlord Kardis and his henchman. She is rescued by Stryker and his young companion Bandit. She later finds herself trapped again by Kardis and resists torture to reveal the location of her colony. Meanwhile, Stryker and Bandit ambush a Kardis water tanker, drive it to his fortress, and manage to escape with Delha. Delha reveals that she has been trying to contact Trun, Stryker's estranged brother, to assist in the defence against Kardis. Trun has been captured and buried by Kardis' men, but is rescued by Stryker. Trun has his lieutenant Bazil to gather his army, but Bazil suddenly betrays them, leading Kardis to attack the colony. Stryker is then captured and tortured, but is rescued by a group of dwarves to whom he had previously given precious water. After a final climatic battle, Trun's battalion defeats Kardis' army with help of Stryker and the dwarves.

The EP was released on January 1, 2010, and spawned two singles, \\"Im Lo Aleh\\" and the title track. A release party was held at Caf√© Caf√© in Jerusalem's Mamilla Mall. After Gaisin and Hoffman returned to the U.S. in 2011, the band reunited and released a music video for the single \\"Falling\\", based on the Biblical story of David and Goliath. The following year, they released another music video called \\"Change\\". A week after the video's release, Hoffman returned to Israel to serve in the IDF's Givati Brigade. Meanwhile, Gaisin stayed in New York and formed the Hasidic soul band Zusha in 2013. Despite this, they released the song \\"Oneness\\" in March and performed at Yeshiva University's annual Hanukkah concert alongside Alex Clare. In 2014, with Hoffman back in New York, he and Gaisin announced on Facebook that they had begun writing new songs together. Later in the year, they released two acoustic songs, \\"All You Got\\" and \\"Give Love\\". As of 2020, Gaisin is performing full-time with Zusha while Hoffman started a solo career under the name Jeryko.

Design MeisterSinger watches distinguish themselves from others by the fact that they use a single hand rather than two or three. This feature of sundials and some old clock towers, for example Westminster Abbey, acted as inspiration behind the design. In 2013 MeisterSinger released a watch based on the Westminster Abbey clock face to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Additionally, to create a sense of symmetry, the hours 1-9 are prefixed with a \\"0\\" such that every number on the dial has double-digits. Historically MeisterSinger used movements sourced from ETA SA, but due to limited availabilityhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304069604579157080572309154chose to develop their own in-house movement.

They all wear brown suits, with ties of varying colours. Four of the detectives sport a hat; the detective without a hat has very short, brown hair. L.A. Noire, a neo-noir detective video game developed by Team Bondi, focuses on police detective Cole Phelps and his partners as they investigate and solve various crimes. Previously a U.S. Marine Lieutenant in the second World War, Phelps's experiences during the war left him scarred, and inspired him to join the Los Angeles Police Department. Cole Phelps is the primary playable character of the game. He is accompanied by a number of characters, notably his partners: Ralph Dunn, Stefan Bekowsky, Rusty Galloway, Roy Earle, and Herschel Biggs. Phelps has two love interests in the game: his wife Marie, and the German singer Elsa Lichtmann, whom he falls in love with throughout the course of the story. For a small part of the game, the player controls Jack Kelso, an investigator who fought alongside Phelps during the war. Despite the similarities of their past, Phelps and Kelso behave in an antagonistic nature toward each other. A team at Team Bondi designed the character appearances, and Brendan McNamara was the main writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The team wanted players to connect with the game's characters, and the actors tried to make their performances appear as realistic as possible. The actors' facial mannerisms were recorded with the newly developed MotionScan, while their physical movements were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. The characters received praise from several gaming publications. The acting has also received acclaim, including a nomination at the British Academy Video Games Awards.  Creation and conception  L.A. Noire has over twenty hours of voice work, and over 400 actors performed for the game. To cast the characters, the team held secretive auditions. Many actors from the television series Mad Men are featured in the game; game writer and director Brendan McNamara explained that this is due to the casting agency, Schiff/Audino, which also casts for Mad Men. When casting actors for the game, the team simply sought \\"quality actors\\", as opposed to well-known actors. During their performances, the actors attempted to appear as realistic as possible. Director Michael Uppendahl said, \\"I try to monitor the performances to make sure we're getting the human element that's going to make it compelling and interesting.\\" L.A. Noire is notable for being the first game to use the newly developed technology MotionScan, developed by Australian company Depth Analysis. MotionScan is a motion capture technology that records the face of an actor at over 1000 frames per second. This technology is crucial to the game's interrogation mechanic, which requires players to use suspects' facial reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. The actors' facial performances were recorded using MotionScan, while their physical movements were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. McNamara felt that the game's technology allows players to connect with the characters in a way that video games have not achieved before. One of his primary goals throughout development was to develop the characters in the game's story. McNamara felt that video game characters generally maintain their traits and personalities from the beginning of a game to the end; with L.A. Noire, he aimed \\"to go on a personal journey with characters\\". \\"What we're adding to the mix is the cinematography of a film and the characterisation and character development of a TV show,\\" said McNamara. He also set out to develop the gameplay \\"based on human interactions\\", and to create characters that players care for.  Lead characters  = Cole Phelps = alt=A 27-year old, dark-haired, bearded man, smiling to the left of the camera. Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton) is the playable character of L.A. Noire. Phelps was a U.S. Marine Lieutenant in the second World War, in which he witnessed many terrible and traumatic events, such as the Battle of Okinawa. He was honourably discharged from the War, later receiving the prestigious Silver Star medal, and joining the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Phelps is initially depicted as a low-ranking police officer in the LAPD, with a background involving traumatic events in the war, which he rarely speaks about. As he solves cases at the Patrol desk, alongside Ralph Dunn, he is depicted as a highly intelligent investigator, and is promoted to the Traffic desk. Phelps's tenure at the Traffic desk, partnered with Stefan Bekowsky, results in the solving of multiple cases of murder and fraud. Six months later, Phelps is promoted to the Homicide desk and partnered with Rusty Galloway. Together, they investigate various cases that contain similarities to the Black Dahlia murder, arresting numerous suspects. However, Phelps is doubtful that they are arresting the actual murderers; his theories are ultimately proved correct, and they eventually track down and kill the real murderer, unbeknownst to the public. Promoted to the high-ranking Administrative Vice desk and partnered with Roy Earle, Phelps is tasked with many investigations relating to drugs and murder. It is during his tenure at the Vice desk that he uncovers that many of the officers in the LAPD are corrupt, including Earle. It is also on this desk where Phelps begins an affair with Elsa Lichtmann, which Earle reports to the chief, resulting in Phelps's demotion to the lowly Arson desk. Partnered with Herschel Biggs, Phelps uncovers and investigates various arsons, before suspecting that the fires are being set by the members of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, who are prominent practitioners of prestigious professions, to receive insurance money. With help from Jack Kelso, enough evidence is found to support the suspicions, but before they can prove them to the public, they are sidetracked by the kidnapping of Lichtmann. They find her in the River Tunnels, which are rapidly flooding. After helping Lichtmann and Kelso escape the tunnels, Phelps is swept away by the current and dies. Staton described Phelps as a \\"war hero ... on a mission to right some wrongs\\". McNamara described Phelps as \\"a character with a moral code\\", but noted that he also has flaws. Staton was convinced to join the project after McNamara showed him the game world, the character of Phelps, and uses of the MotionScan technology. He was particularly intrigued in the \\"incorporation of the physical performance in a game, combined with some of the stylistic elements and the story\\". Prior to performing, Staton received a 12-page document that outlined the story, and the history of Phelps. He has said that he received the document as there wasn't enough time to read the 2,200-page script before filming began. He joined the project after the story was written and most of the world was developed. Staton worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months in total. He said, \\"Consecutively I think I worked six months, and then for the next year here and there picking things up, adding, changing and tweaking things\\". Staton called the MotionScan process \\"an isolating experience\\", as he was acting in a room alone. Staton claims that it took about 90 minutes to prepare his hair before filming, due to the precise requirements of the technology, and that he \\"never wore a single fedora\\" during production, despite Phelps's appearance. Initially, McNamara was not keen about the casting of Staton, but Rockstar Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser convinced him into agreeing. \\"[Cole Phelps] is conflicted and has quite a bit of depth and [Staton] is great at conveying those things,\\" said McNamara. = Jack Kelso = alt=A 35-year old, dark-haired, bearded man, talking into a microphone and looking to the left of the camera. Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney) is the second playable character of L.A. Noire. He was a U.S. Marine in the Second World War, in which he developed a rivalry with Cole Phelps. After the war, Jack became a claims investigator for California Fire and Life Insurance Company. He was approached by Courtney Sheldon, whose stolen Army surplus morphine had been obtained by Mickey Cohen and given to drug addicts, causing them to overdose. Sheldon asked for Jack's help to avoid prison and more deaths. Jack reluctantly helped Sheldon negotiate with Cohen. However, Cohen struck first by sending hit-men to kill of Jack's old unit who were involved in the morphine heist. Jack was later approached by Elsa Lichtmann, who planned to reject an insurance settlement; Elsa expressed her suspicions that Elysian Fields Development were attempting to cover up something that was more than just an accident. Jack began his investigation at the housing development site, where he discovered that the houses were made from inferior materials, and later discovered a connection to the Suburban Redevelopment Fund. Jack also discovered that his own boss was involved, along with Leland Monroe and other influential and political figures. He later discovered that, through Jack, Elsa was helping Phelps. Despite his rivalry with Phelps, Jack promised to continue his investigation. Jack deduced that Leland Monroe's plan was to burn some of the substandard houses for the insurance money, while other housing developments were built in the intended path of freeways, such that the government would exercise eminent domain and purchase the land at artificially-inflated prices. Shortly afterwards, Jack learned of Elsa's kidnapping. He discovered that the arsonist of the housing developments was a fellow Marine and former flamethrower operator Ira Hogeboom, and that Elsa was likely holed up with Ira in the river tunnels. After being escorted to the river tunnels, Jack and Phelps reached Ira, with Elsa under his protection. Phelps arrived to take Elsa to safety as Jack performed a mercy kill on Ira. Elsa and Jack exit the tunnel, but Phelps was killed by a violent torrent of water. At Phelps's funeral, Elsa stormed off and angrily. Jack asked Phelps's former partner Herschel Biggs to console her; as he left, he made it clear to Jack that Phelps was never Jack's friend, but confirmed that he believed Phelps knew that they were never enemies. Towards the end of the final desk, players assume control of Kelso, and alternate between him and Phelps; although different in appearance and personality, the characters are controlled identically. When discussing the player character change near the end of the story, from Phelps to Kelso, McNamara explained that the narrative \\"got to the point where [Phelps] couldn't really do much more, and you have to go outside the realm of being a cop to bend the rules\\".  Secondary characters  = Stefan Bekowsky = Stefan Bekowsky (Sean McGowan) is the partner of Cole Phelps while on the Traffic Desk. Bekowsky was partnered with Phelps following the latter's promotion from the Patrol department. While their relationship began antagonistically, they soon became close. Bekowsky helped Phelps to investigate and solve many crimes, uncovering acts of conspiracies, fraud and murder. Phelps was later promoted to the Burglary department. Following Phelps's eventual promotion to the Vice desk, Bekowsky was promoted to the Homicide department, and partnered with Rusty Galloway. When McGowan auditioned for the role of Bekowsky, he felt an instant connection to the character, which made him enthusiastic about the role; McGowan called Bekowsky \\"a hoot to play\\". When discussing his character, McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps, but eventually warmed up to him. \\"Like a good older brother he'll always have his back but will never take shit from him,\\" he said. McGowan describes Bekowsky as \\"a sarcastic, outspoken cop who loves a good fight and a good joke\\", stating that \\"he's a wise crack but he's not a total dick\\". = Rusty Galloway = Finbarr \\"Rusty\\" Galloway (Michael McGrady) is the partner of Cole Phelps while on the Homicide Desk. Galloway was initially partnered with Floyd Rose, but following Rose's retirement and Phelps's promotion, he was partnered with Phelps. Galloway initially disliked Phelps, treating him with arrogance, but became more friendly over time. The two were immediately tasked with solving a murder case with similarities to the Black Dahlia murder. After solving the case, Galloway and Phelps received several similar cases, which appeared to be committed by the Black Dahlia's killer, but ultimately led to other suspects being arrested through strong evidence. With strong cases and convictions, Galloway dismissed the similarities between the murders, refusing to admit a connection. However, when clues were discovered connecting the crimes, Phelps and Galloway discovered that all of the murders were connected, and eventually track down and kill the real murderer, unbeknownst to the public. Phelps was then promoted to the Vice department, and Galloway was eventually partnered with Stefan Bekowsky. McGrady was impressed by the amount of detail and research put into the game, as well as the way in which Galloway's character was written, which convinced him to play the role after reading the script. McGrady said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character. \\"I am a classic introvert but I can hold court when I need to. I think Rusty is that way too,\\" he said. = Roy Earle = Roy Earle (Adam J. Harrington) is the partner of Cole Phelps while on the Administrative Vice Desk. Earle played a part in Phelps's promotion to the Vice department, having realised his growing fame and success. The two investigated several cases regarding morphine distribution in Los Angeles, as well as busting a marijuana distribution ring and a prize fight racket. Earle was involved in a scandal with the rest of the Vice department, which threatened to ruin the current administration if it became public. Earle approached other superior officers involved in the scandal with a story to distract the press‚ÄîPhelps's affair with Elsa Lichtmann‚Äîin exchange for being part of the syndicate. This ultimately led to Phelps's demotion to the Arson department. Phelps, along with Jack Kelso, continued to investigate the syndicate, putting the administration at risk. However, Phelps's death prior to any evidence going public allowed Earle to conceal his corruption and involvement with the syndicate. Harrington described Roy as \\"jaded, tough, mean, cruel, brutally honest and ... very funny\\". Both Harrington and McNamara felt that Roy was \\"one of the truest characters to the genre\\"; his actions and opinions, including his racist and misogynistic attitudes and sense of entitlement, were reflective of those in the time period. Harrington took credit for all of Roy's facial expressions, but said that all of the dialogue was scripted, as opposed to ad-lib. Harrington felt that the motion capture performances felt akin to a live performance, whereas the MotionScan process felt \\"a little restricting\\". = Herschel Biggs = alt=A 59-year old, brown man, smiling to the camera. Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka) is the partner of Cole Phelps while on the Arson Desk. Like Phelps, Biggs is a former Marine as well, having served during World War I. Biggs was partnered with Phelps following his demotion from Vice to Arson. Initially unfriendly towards Phelps, due to his distaste for partners, Biggs showed him little sympathy due to his affair. While investigating house fires, Phelps suspected that the fires were connected, which Biggs dismissed as weak attempts to restore his personal glory. Biggs became visibly distraught while investigating another house fire, which he attributed to his experience during the Battle of Belleau Wood in which a barn that his unit was trapped in was destroyed. After investigating a housing development that burned down, Biggs and Phelps began to suspect a connection between the arson and Elysian Fields Development. After questioning Leland Monroe, Biggs and Phelps were threatened (by Captain McKelty and Roy Earle, respectively) to stop them from investigating Monroe's affairs, and they decided to close the case. The two began to work more cooperatively, and trust each other. Their investigation was then halted due to the corruption and Monroe's influences, but Jack Kelso helped them discover more evidence of the conspiracy behind Monroe and the Suburban Redevelopment Fund. When Biggs and Phelps were investigating the murder of Harlan Fontaine, they discovered that the Suburban Redevelopment Fund was committing extortion through eminent domain. They arrived at the river tunnels to help Kelso save Elsa and apprehend the arsonist behind the fires, Ira Hogeboom. Biggs pulled Kelso and Elsa safely out of the tunnel, but Phelps was killed by a violent torrent of water. At Phelps's funeral, Biggs tells Kelso that the latter was \\"never [Phelps's] friend\\", though admitted that he was \\"never his enemy\\". = Elsa Lichtmann = Elsa Lichtmann (Erika Heynatz) is a German singer at The Blue Room nightclub. Lichtmann first met Phelps after his promotion from Traffic, after which he developed an interest in her and frequently visited the club to watch her perform. When Elsa becomes a witness in an investigation, Phelps tails her to her hotel, and the two begin an affair. This ultimately leads to Phelps's demotion, and his interest in the LAPD's corruption. Elsa seeks help from Jack Kelso, who uncovers more information regarding the corruption, and the syndicate of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund. When Elsa confronted psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine about the syndicate, due to his involvement, he attacked her; she was rescued by the intervention of Ira Hogeboom, who took her to the river tunnels and protected her. Phelps and Kelso soon take her from the tunnels, but the former is killed by a violent torrent of water. At Phelps's funeral, Roy Earle claims that the accusations against Phelps of an affair with Elsa were false, which causes her to walk out in a fit of sorrow and rage. Heynatz described the MotionScan process as \\"other-worldly\\". Elsa's musical performances were played by German singer Claudia Br√ºcken. = Leland Monroe = Australian actor alt=A 63-year old, dark-haired man, smiling at the left of the camera. Leland Monroe (John Noble) is the founder and CEO of Elysian Fields Development, and played a large role in the creation of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, an organisation of private investors to develop houses for returning servicemen in Los Angeles. While he had a strong investment in the organisation, he developed a plan to extort millions of dollars from the government: to build fraudulent, and thereby cheap, houses along the path of the new freeway, which the government would then purchase as eminent domain, repaying Monroe and the investors. Gaining the support of several high-ranking figures of the city, Monroe effectively turned the Suburban Redevelopment Fund into a criminal syndicate. While Monroe bought out several estates, he faced the predicament of some holdouts; as a solution, Monroe and Harlan Fontaine ordered Ira Hogeboom to burn down the houses, allowing Monroe to acquire the states. When Arson detectives Cole Phelps and Herschel Biggs suspected Monroe's involvement in the house fires, they questioned him; Monroe denied all allegations. Meanwhile, private investigator Jack Kelso also became close to discovering the truth of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, and Monroe personally phoned him to offer a settlement. Suspecting a trap, Kelso fought his way through Monroe's protection and raided his mansion, discovering evidence in his office such as the payroll of corrupt figures, Fontaine's criminal report, and the list of holdouts. Kelso shot Monroe in the leg and left him to bleed to death. He managed to survive, and it is suggested that he was later sent to prison. McNamara contacted Noble early in development, in about 2005. Throughout development, Noble regularly visited the studio and performed tests with the MotionScan technology. The team eventually approached him for a role in the game, which he accepted the role due to the advancement of the technology, as well as his fondness for McNamara. Noble eventually began performing in early 2010. He described Monroe as \\"such a different character\\" than his usual roles. = Harlan Fontaine = alt=A man with ginger hair and a ginger beard looking to the left of the camera. Harlan J. Fontaine (Peter Blomquist) is a clinical psychiatrist in Los Angeles. Following one of his psychology lectures, Fontaine met former Marine Courtney Sheldon, and offered him a part-time job at one of his clinics. The two formed a close mentor‚Äìstudent relationship, and Sheldon eventually turned to Fontaine in a moment of crisis: Sheldon and his fellow Marines had stolen army surplus morphine following the end of the war, and had reached a predicament regarding the distribution of the morphine. Fontaine made a deal to take the morphine, promising to distribute it legally to medical facilities, in return reinvesting the money into building houses for returning G.I.s; in actuality, Fontaine discreetly sold the morphine to addicts. He used the profits to invest in the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, becoming part of a criminal syndicate to extort millions of dollars through insurance claims. When Sheldon confronted Fontaine after discovering evidence of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, Fontaine killed him. He was later confronted by Elsa Lichtmann, one of his patients, about the same thing. As he prepared to kill Elsa, Ira Hogeboom arrived and killed Fontaine. = Courtney Sheldon = Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter) is a former Navy Corpsman, serving with the United States Navy and Marine Corps. As his unit was returning on the SS Coolridge to the United States after the war, Sheldon suggested that they steal the ship's cargo of surplus morphine, and sell it upon their return. After doing so, the drug trafficking operation resulted in the death of addicts; Sheldon tried to halt the operation, to the displeasure of gangster Mickey Cohen and his organisation. Sheldon sought assistance from psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine, with whom he had developed a close relationship. Fontaine agreed to take the morphine and distribute it to medical facilities; in actuality, the morphine was sold on the streets, and the profits were used in the Suburban Redevelopment Fund, a syndicate set up to extort millions of dollars through insurance claims. When Sheldon confronted Fontaine after discovering evidence of the syndicate, Fontaine killed him. = Mickey Cohen = Mickey Cohen (Patrick Fischler) is a gangster, and a member of the Jewish Mafia. Friendly with many other members of the Vice squad, Cohen encountered Phelps on a number of cases, accompanied by his bodyguard Johnny Stompanato. Cohen is in control of prostitution, illegal gambling, racketeering, narcotic distribution and several murders. He offered to purchase stolen morphine from Courtney Sheldon; when Sheldon refused, Cohen ordered the death of him and the rest of his military unit. In L.A. Noire, Cohen is the fictional version of gangster Mickey Cohen (1913‚Äì1976), who was involved in similar situations as depicted in the game. Fischler described the experience as \\"a real thrill\\", particularly due to Cohen's real reputation, and Fischler's recurring interest in the gangster genre. = James Donnelly = James Donnelly (Andrew Connolly) is the captain of the LAPD Homicide Department. He first met Phelps during a murder investigation on the Patrol desk; Donnelly was impressed by his initiative, and requested Phelps's promotion to Detective. When Phelps was promoted to the Homicide department, Donnelly partnered him with Rusty Galloway. He briefed Phelps and Galloway during their time on the department, assisting in many of their later cases. When Phelps was charged with adultery, Donnelly expressed his disappointment. Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both LAPD Captain Jack Donahue, as well as Brendan McNamara's father.  Reception  The characters received positive responses. Justin McElroy of Joystiq found that the characters and the script combined to place L.A. Noire among the \\"most compelling video game stories ever\\". Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker praised the juxtaposition between Phelps and the \\"atmosphere of corruption, paranoia, and opportunism\\". Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar felt that Phelps is initially \\"a robotic douche\\", but becomes more likable as the game progresses. Kotaku's Stephen Totilo was fascinated by the depth of the characters, particularly by how little was known about Phelps by the story's end. Steve Boxer of The Guardian stated that the events in Phelps's life increased the game's immersion. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer wrote that, although the game's plot helps with \\"bringing the characters to life\\", characters such as Phelps felt \\"dry\\". The character performances also received praise. Edge praised Staton's \\"solid\\" performance, but wrote that the supporting cast‚Äîsuch as Connelly's performance as Captain Donnelly‚Äî\\"stands out\\". IGN's Hilary Goldstein commended all elements of the performances, including the mannerisms and expressions of the actors. Game Informers Matt Helgeson described the voice acting as \\"high quality\\" and \\"superb\\". Giant Bomb's Shoemaker wrote that the performances \\"range from good to stellar\\". IGN's Anthony Gallegos wrote that the performances evoke genuine empathy and emotion, and command the attention of the player. Some of the actors were awarded for their performances: Staton received nominations from the British Academy Video Games Awards and The Daily Telegraph.  References  L.A. Noire L.A.

Ryan played college football for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was selected in the second round of the 1954 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears of the NFL. Early years Ryan was born in Tolono, Illinois. He attended Unity High School in Tolono, Illinois from 1946 to 1950 and played both football and basketball. In addition, he won the Illinois State Pole Vault Title during the 1947-1948 school year. Ryan's pole vault championship assisted the high school track and field team in finishing tenth overall at the state meet. College career After graduating from high school, Ryan attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he joined the football team. His style of play lead to him being referred to as a \\"daring young Irishman\\". Perhaps the highlight of his collegiate football career was playing in the 1952 Rose Bowl, the first nationally televised college football game, where he caught a touchdown pass. Ryan's touchdown was Illinois' final score of the game and was part of a dominant Rose Bowl performance by the team that the University of Illinois Alumni Association would go on to name one of the top ten moments in Illini football history. In addition to his performance on the field, Ryan became known for one significant off-field incident during his collegiate career, referred to as \\"The Apple Bowl.\\" After the University of Illinois defeated the University of Iowa 33-13 in a game held on November 8, 1952, Iowa fans began to throw apples and other fruit at Illinois players as the players exited the field. Shortly thereafter, Ryan was approached by a University of Iowa fan named Richard Wolfe, and, after an exchange between the two men, Ryan punched Wolfe in the face, breaking his jaw. The incident resulted in the two schools not playing a football game against each other for fifteen years. Professional career In 1954, he was selected in the second round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. However, his entry into the NFL was delayed as he enlisted in the United States Army and served from 1954 to 1956. Ryan ultimately played for the Eagles during the 1956 and 1957 seasons but, partway through the 1958 season, left the team for the Chicago Bears. It was rumored for a period of time that Ryan was originally placed on waivers by the Eagles for a situation in which his temper \\"flared up\\" in an exchange with coach Buck Shaw. The 1958 season would be his last with the NFL, at which point he returned to Champaign, Illinois and worked a variety of jobs prior to his retirement.

It is the causative agent of Lumpy jaw in cattle, and occasionally causes infections in humans. Actinomyces bovis normally populates the gastrointestinal tract of healthy ruminants, but are opportunistic in nature and will move into tissues through ulcerations or abrasions of the mucosa to cause disease. Disease occurs when there is physical damage to the tissue of the mouth, allowing the bacteria to colonize the deep tissue and bone. Because this organism is zoonotic, it is a human health concern and can cause granulomas, abscesses, skin lesions, and bronchopneumonia. History Actinomyces bovis was first described in 1877 by C. O. Harz, as a microbe within the jaw tissue of cows with lumpy jaw. It was thought to be identical to Actinomyces israelii until 1940, when D. Erikson showed these to be two separate organisms. In culture Actinomyces bovis can be isolated from the pus of an infected animal and cultured in brain heart infusion. It is catalase-negative, and can form both smooth and rough colonies on agar.

Fuglevad Watermill, located approximately one kilometer downstream from Lyndby Nordre M√∏lle, has a history that dates back to the 15th century but the current buildings are from the 1870s. Fuglevad Windmill, a smock mill from 1832, is now located inside the grounds of the Frilandsmuseet open-air museu which opened at the site in 1901. Fuglevad Station is located on the N√¶rum Line and is served by the railway company Lokaltog. History Ole K√∏rgen Rawert: Fuglevad Mill, 23 August 1823 The first known reference to Fuglevad Watermill is from 1492. The mill is also mentioned in several documents from the early 17th century and was then called Folevd. Fole- is Old Danish for rotten, unclean or foul-smelling while -vad means ford. The watermill was owned by the crown but B√∂cker van Delden, a wealthy merchant from Copenhagen who already owned Brede Watermill and Stampem√∏lle, received it in fee in 1629. He went bankrupt in 1633 and the mills at Fuglevad and Brede was then taken over by Henrik Rosenmeyer. In 1668, the crown sold the mill to the coppersmith Henrik Ehm. Part of the deal was also M√∏lletorp, which was later replaced by senere Palace. Martinus N√ºrnberg purchased the mill later in the century and his son Laurids N√ºrnberg took it over in 1734. He adapted Fuglevad for use as a sharpening mill with a production of scythe. In 1753, Fuglevad was taken over by the same partnership that owned Brede and Nym√∏lle and the mill was from then on used as a branch of the copperworks there. Fuglevad in about 1860 In 1802, J√∏rgen Christian Lund acquired Fuglevad Watermill. His widow ran the mill after his death in 1818 until it was passed on to Johan J√∏rgen Lund in 1828. Due to problem with too little water in the river, he constructed he windmill on a hill to the west of the watermill in 1832. In 1862, both mills were taken over by Carl Tommerup who was married to Lund's eldest daughter Sophie Amalie. In 1872, he sold it to the paper manufacturer J.C. Drewsen & Sons from Strandm√∏llen but the following year they sold it to Ludvig Gudmann with a Contractual term excluding it from use as a paper mill. Gudmann and his partner G. F. Hamann tore down the old watermill and replaced it with the current building in 1874 which was used for manufacturing artificial leather. The old water wheel was replaced by a turbine. William Salmonsen purchased Fuglevad and Brede Mills in 1883. Ocer the next decades it was used for changing industrial activities including as a galvanisation plant until it was sold to Lyngby-Taarb√¶k Municipality in 1828. National Museum rook over the buildings in 1960. Ludvig Gudmann had constructed the house Villa Folevad at a site close to the watermill. It was purchased by the Parish of Lyngby in 1930 and ceded to an orphanage but it was turned into a private residence in about 1950. It was acquired by National Museum in the 1960s but sold in 2005. Today Fuglevad Mill Pond Fuglevad Watermill is owned by Lyndby-Taarb√¶k Municipality. It is built in red brick and has a tile roof. The water turbine has been removed and the mill is thus no longer operational. The building is operated as a venue for meetings and other events. Picnic facilities are also available at the site. Fuglevad in about 1834 Fuglevad Windmill is the only building on display in the Frilandsmuseet open-air museum which stands in its original location. The museum opened at the site in 1901 and boasts a total of four windmills and three watermills. Fuglevad Windmill is a smock mill and operated on special occasions. Fuglevad Station Fuglevad station is served by Lokaltog's service on the N√¶rum Line which links J√¶gersborg station in the south with N√¶rum station in N√¶rum in the north.

The Lions are a member of the Northeast Conference - American Division of the UPSL Championship. Logo and colors The colors of the AFC Lancaster Lions are red, blue, yellow, and white. The crest features the motto, Unos pro omnibus, ones pro uno (sic.), a Latin phrase meaning, \\"One for all, all for one.\\" The heraldic imagery of a lion, a red rose, and the contour of the shield likely recall traditional English insignia. For example, the Royal Arms of England features a red shield charged with three golden lions on display, with blue as an accent color. The Pennsylvania city of Lancaster was named for Lancaster, Lancashire, England, whose official symbol was the Red Rose of Lancaster. The soccer balls arranged at the top of the crest are also English in style, with outlines similar to those found on the shield for Manchester United F.C., a renowned Premier League club. The logo also includes two crossed hickory logs, a more local reference since Lancaster city was first named \\"Hickory Town.\\" The design also shares many elements in common with the civic flag of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, itself featuring two red roses and English royalty colors. Finally, the founding year of the city, 1730, and the inaugural season, 2015, of the AFC Lions finish the logo.

The Madras mission was established in 1817, with Royapettah as the headquarters. During the later period of the 19th century, the need was felt to expand in regions like Egmore and Perambur. During 1892, the Garden House in Poonamalle High Road was purchased for the pastor of the English group. Rev. John Breedan, who was the first to occupy the premises with the lotus tank in front of it worked towards the foundation of the church. The foundation of the Church was laid on 28 December 1903 with the filling of lotus tank on Poonamalle High Road in Egmore by Prof. George G. Findlay and his fellow missionaries of the Wesleyan Mission. The church was formally inaugurated on 11 February 1905 by Rev.

It is an erect shrub with greyish, slightly furry, variably-shaped leaves and white to pale blue or purple petals. Description Eremophila accrescens usually grows to a height of with leaves and stems densely covered with hairs and resin forming a shiny layer between the hairs. Grooves extend down the stems from either sides of the leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately, angled out from the stem and mostly egg- shaped with the narrower end towards the base. They are also channelled, long, wide and have a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a straight stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, egg- shaped, pinkish-coloured sepals which differ in size from each other and which increase in size as the fruits develop. The petals are long joined at their base to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale purple with the inner surface glabrous but with some of the lobes hairy. There are four stamens which do not extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering mostly occurs in summer, but may also be sporadic, depending on rainfall. The fruit is an oval shape, about . Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007. The description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock about south east of Ashburton Downs. The specific epithet (accrescens) is from the Latin word cresco meaning \\"to grow\\" or \\"to increase\\" referring to the increase in size of the sepals during and after flowering. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in the Ashburton and southern Fortescue districts in the Gascoyne and Pilbara biogeographic regions. It grows in rocky places and along drainage lines in gritty loam on desert pavement. Conservation status Eremophila accrescens is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is an attractive species with its massed flower display and persistent sepals. It can be grafted onto Myoporum species and grows well when provided with full sun and a well-drained soil but is very sensitive to frost.

It was Ernest Meissonier who, during one of his stays in Bordighera at Villa Garnier, recommended to his parents to make him study arts. In 1882 Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana moved to Turin to study all'Albertina Academy where he had as professors Francesco Gamba and Andrea Gastaldi. It is in Turin that he made his first paintings: \\"A ponenete di Bordighera, campagna ligure\\", \\"Politica rustica\\" and in 1898 \\"Studio d'artista\\" that will be purchased by the government. In 1903 he moved to Sesto San Giovanni, he exhibited at the Permanent show in Milan where he presented \\"Peace\\", which received unexpected praise. In 1906 he was invited to the National exhibition in Milan where he presented \\"Cortile dei leoni a Granada\\", \\"La danza delle olive\\" and \\"Mare dopo la pioggia\\". The latter two paintings were purchased by the Galleria d'Arte Moderna (Milan). In 1919 he participated in the Quadrennial Turin presenting \\"Ultima onda\\" and in the same year he became a member of the prestigious Brera Academy. Besides painting, he also studied the fresco technique and Queen Margaret commissioned him one for Villa Etelinda. Having lived in Bordighera he got to know all the local artists of his time, including Charles Garnier, Mos√© Bianchi, Hermann Nestel, Friederich von Kleudgen, Giuseppe Balbo and Pompeo Mariani. This last one will be one of his closest friends and he'll introduce Mariani to Marcellina Caronni, who will then become his wife. Piana always devoted a special attention to the colors of Bordighera and of the neighboring countries, demonstrating the technique of watercolor and oil, in particular for vivid glimpses of the rich vegetation, landscapes and bright sun. He became the personal professor of the Queen Mother and met De Amicis of whom he made a portrait during his stay in Bordighera. Several exhibitions of his paintings were organised, including a particularly rich one in 1954 at the Palazzo del Parco in Bordighera and a very significant one for the type of works on display at the Gallery Bolzani Milan in 1968. Among his favourite students was the most beloved Fernando Pelosini (1901-1982) to whom he left all his painting material. Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana died in Bordighera in 1956 at the age of 92.

Templeton served as president of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Biography Templeton was born in New Waverly, Texas. He received an undergraduate degree from Sam Houston State Teachers College in 1936 and master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Houston. He was 19 when he became a principal and English, Spanish and algebra teacher at Willow Hole High School in Texas. Between 1937 and 1940, he was principal and taught biology, physics and math at League City High School. After serving in World War II and working for an oil company, he became an assistant superintendent and superintendent for several school districts in the Greater Houston area. After a stint as president of Alvin Junior College between 1954 and 1964, Templeton became president of Sam Houston State Teachers College. He succeeded Harmon Lowman, who had governed with a more informal style. Templeton made more demands on the Sam Houston faculty than his predecessor, placing an importance on student and faculty research and on increasing the percentage of doctorally-prepared professors. The school's name changed twice during his tenure, first to Sam Houston State College, then to Sam Houston State University in 1969. Sam Houston State's criminal justice programs were created during Templeton's time as president. Sam Houston State's criminal justice program offered the school's first doctoral degree. He was installed as the first president of the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1970, where he served for two years. He was then the president of the University of Texas at El Paso for several years. Templeton's 1972 appointment as UTEP's president has been cited as an example of the power struggles that can occur in multicampus university systems. At a time when the university was facing several significant issues, including widespread protests by the Hispanic student population on campus, Templeton and other UTEP executives were appointed by the University of Texas System without the consultation of UTEP faculty. Templeton retired from UTEP in 1980. He and his wife moved to San Antonio, where he ran a job training center until his 1999 retirement. Honors Templeton was named a Distinguished Alumnus by Sam Houston State University in 1977.

Sinanitsa is commonly regarded as one of the most beautiful peaks in Pirin and Bulgaria. On clear days, the summit is easily visible from the town of Sandanski. The etymology of Sinanitsa's name is debated. It stems either from the Bulgarian word for \\"blue\\" (—Å–∏–Ω, sin), due to the peak appearing in that colour from a distance, or from the Arabic word sinan (ÿ≥ŸÜÿßŸÜ). The latter would describe it as a \\"spearhead\\" peak, referencing its sharp contours.

The Sinanitsa Hut is situated by the shores of the lake, within direct view of the summit. The summit can be reached in approximately an hour from the hut.

The station replaced an earlier station on the original line of the railway that had been served by a stationary engine. It was open from 1885 until 1952 for passengers and 1965 for freight.  History  The Bolton and Leigh Railway (B&LR;) opened for goods traffic in 1828, followed by passenger services in 1831. The original railway included two inclines worked by stationary engines, one of which was situated at Daubhill, south of Bolton Great Moor Street railway station (originally called just Bolton) with the line climbing up out of Bolton. The stationary engines played a prominent role on the line for at least 15 years and it is believed they remained in operation until about 1846. Cable haulage was discontinued once locomotive performance had improved sufficiently. The incline at Daubhill was superseded by a deviation built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1885, the LNWR was by then the owner and operator of the line. The deviation also enabled the LNWR to increase capacity by doubling the line. A new Daubhill railway station was built on the deviation to replace the original Daubhill station at the top of the incline. The station opened on 2 February 1885 and was renamed Rumworth and Daubhill railway station on the 28 April 1885. The deviation ran in a cutting and the station was built with two platforms on the outsides of the tracks with the station building above reached by steps either side. The station was located at the intersection of St Helens Road and Dean Church Road, the railway ran diagonally underneath this intersection. A station had a small goods yard. Holland says this was leased for many years to the Hulton Colliery Company. Rumworth and Daubhill closed to passengers on 3 March 1952, although local services continued to pass through until all regular passenger services from Bolton Great Moor St were withdrawn on 27 March 1954. After closure the station was demolished and the cutting in which the station was located has been infilled leaving no trace of the station or railways existence.

Before completion, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, renamed HMCS Humberstone, and served the rest of the war as a convoy escort. Following the war, the corvette was sold for mercantile service, beginning as Taiwei in 1946 and ending as South Ocean in 1954. The ship was broken up in 1959. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p.63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p.129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Construction and career Norham Castle, named after the castle in Northumberland, was ordered on 19 December 1942. The ship was laid down on 30 August 1943 by A. & J. Inglish Ltd. at Glasgow and launched on 12 April 1944.Macpherson and Barrie, p.163 At some point in 1943, the vessel was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. Renamed Humberstone after a community in southern Ontario, the corvette was commissioned on 6 September 1944 with the pennant number K497. After commissioning Humberstone was sent to Tobermory to work up. Following that, the ship joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force as a member of the escort group C-8 for convoy escort duty in the Atlantic Ocean. Humberstone remained as a convoy escort for the remainder of the war. In May 1945, the ship returned to Canada, travelling to Esquimalt, British Columbia in June. The ship was paid off on 17 November 1945. In 1946, the ship was sold for mercantile service and was converted to a cargo ship with a gross register tonnage of 1,304 tons. Renamed Taiwei and operating under Chinese ownership while registered at Shanghai in 1946, the ship was sold in 1947 to Foo Ming SS Co Ltd and renamed Chang Chen. In 1949, the cargo ship was renamed twice, first Tai Shan, then King Kang. In 1950 King Kang was sold to Wallem & Co Ltd and registered in Panama. The ship was renamed Flying Dragon in 1950 and San Blas in 1951. She became South Ocean in 1954, owned by Korea Deep Sea Fishery Co Ltd and operating under a Korean flag.

The church is declared a landmark heritage building by the Tamil Nadu Chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). It was also on the Phase I list of Heritage buildings in Chennai under the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). History Image of the old view of the Esplanade Road (NSC Bose Road), with the Church seen on the right The church was named after John Anderson (1805‚Äì1855), a Scottish missionary who founded the mission of the Free Church of Scotland at Madras, India. He is believed to have established an educational institution in the name of General Assembly School in 1835 at Egmore. It was moved to George Town area in Chennai by 1838 and later went on to become the Free Church of Scotland's central shrine in Chennai in 1845. The Madras Christian College was started at this campus in 1867, initially as a school and later became a college in 1876. The College was later moved to Tambaram in 1937 and only the Church operates from the campus. The Chapel was originally called College Chapel, but later came to be known as Anderson Church, after the death of Anderson. Worship practises The priests in the church were originally only English, but during modern times, Tamil people were also allowed. In modern times, the Church is administered by the Diocese of Madras of the Church of South India. Service is performed in the church from Monday to Friday on 8 a.m., 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturdays and 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays.

In: New York History, October 1987, pag. 393 was an American general practitioner, amateur historical linguist and forger. Biography Van Loon was possibly a direct descendant of Jan Van Loon, who had emigrated from Liege to New Netherland in the seventeenth century. He learned the remains of the Mohawk Dutch language, the taol, from his maternal grandfather, Walter Hill (1856-1925), a schoolteacher. At the age of ten he went to Reading, New York, for a journey to the Mohawk Valley. During the summers of 1930 and 1932 he spent an internship at the Wilhelmina Hospital in Amsterdam. In 1932 he married a Dutch woman, Grietje Prins. Between 1955 and 1967 he was medical director on Hawaii. He was a member of the Holland Society and of the Dutch Settlers Society of Albany. Van Loon was also keeper of the records and translator of the Association of Blauvelt Descendants, descendants of Gerrit Hendrickszen (Blauvelt), who moved from Deventer to New Netherland in 1638. His lifelong relationship with the Dutch language made him an authority on the old Dutch language spoken on the East Coast of the United States. However, several of his publications seemed to be suspect. In 1980 it was established that work of Van Loon was based on forged documents.Ch. Gehring: 'Dutch colonial manuscript'. In: De Halve maen.

In: The Berkeley Conference on Dutch Linguistics 1993. Dutch linguistics in a changing Europe. Lanham, Md, University Press of America, 1995 Among his suspect findings is the Tawagonshi treaty. Other discoveries by Van Loon that proved to be false before publication were an early deed to Manhattan, a map of Albany from 1701, and a map of the Hudson River.

It is located at 12547 Highway 9. Its aim is to preserve and share the history of the San Lorenzo Valley.  Organisation history  The Boulder Creek Historical Society was founded in March 1976 with the primary museum housed on the second floor of an office building in south Boulder Creek. The museum grew steadily until relocated in 1999 to the former Grace Episcopal Church on the southern edge of Boulder Creek. Alongside the new home, a climate-controlled annex was built beside the church to house the museum's archive and administrative office. The original garden beside the church has also seen constant expansion and improvement since the museum took control over the property. The Boulder Creek Historical Society officially became the San Lorenzo Valley Historical Society in 2012, reflecting the renaming of the museum to the San Lorenzo Valley Museum upon its relocation in 1999. In addition to annual events held at the museum and on behalf of the museum, the monthly meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors Fifth District is held inside the museum.\\"Who We Are\\". San Lorenzo Valley Museum. (Accessed 25 November 2015)  Museum structure  The main museum resides in what was originally the Grace Episcopal Church, built in November 1906 and currently the oldest religious structure in downtown Boulder Creek. The Episcopal Church never attracted a large following in Boulder Creek with most residents instead attending the nearby Presbyterian Church or the Catholic Church and most Episcopalians attending St. Andrew's Church in Ben Lomond. The Episcopal Church abandoned the structure in 1915. In 1923, the structure was purchased by the Christian Science Society of Boulder Creek and eventually, in 1955, became a full member church as the First Church of Christ Scientist, Boulder Creek. The Boulder Creek Historical Society purchased the ailing structure to use as its main museum in 1995 and they restored it to working condition over the next four years. It finally opened at its new facilities in 1999. The former church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, the centenary of its construction.\\"Grace Episcopal Church Building\\". San Lorenzo Valley Museum.

History =Military use in the 18th & 19th centuries= The house was designed by James Wyatt and built between 1789 and 1793 in Plymouth limestone. It was originally known as Government House and served as the home of the military Governor of Plymouth; it later housed the General Officer Commanding Western District until that army command moved out in 1905. The house was then used as the home of the General Officer Commanding Wessex Area until 1934. =Naval use in the 20th & 21st centuries= The naval Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, who had previously been based next door at Hamoaze House, moved into the property in 1934 and it was renamed Admiralty House. At the same time Hamoaze House, was handed over to the Major-General commanding the Royal Marines. Area Command Headquarters and Plymouth Underground Extension  In 1939-41 a partly subterranean complex of buildings was constructed in the grounds of the house, within the ditch of the old fortifications, to serve as a combined RN/RAF headquarters for maritime operations; similar Area Command Headquarters were constructed at the same time close to the Royal Naval Dockyards at Portsmouth, Chatham) and Rosyth. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, visited the house and the combined headquarters in 1941. The headquarters were expanded during World War II by a series of tunnels, known as Plymouth Underground Extension (PUE), which formed a sizeable bomb-proof bunker complex under the garden of Admiralty House; it could be accessed from Richmond Walk, Blagdon's boatyard and Hamoaze House as well as from the headquarters building itself. PUE was closed in the 1950s but the headquarters block continued in use. Post- war After the war the combined headquarters (renamed Maritime Headquarters) remained in use as headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, and as such provided command facilities for NATO operations in the Eastern Atlantic, together with local co-ordination of RN, RAF and Civil Defence capabilities, and assorted intelligence and maritime surveillance facilities. In the mid-1980s and early 1990s the facility was comprehensively upgraded. After 1969, Admiralty House became the home of the Flag Officer, Plymouth until that post was also disbanded in 1996. The complex was then used to house a number of different operations on a temporary basis until 2004 when it was earmarked for disposal. =Closure and sale of the site= The house was marketed for sale as a potential hotel in 2014 and much of the surrounding site was adapted for residential use in 2015.

The division's only combat occurred in Operation Whirlwind, the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.  History  The 31st Guards Airborne Division was formed on 15 October 1948 from the 298th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 100th Guards Airborne Division in Novohrad- Volynskyi, part of the 39th Guards Airborne Corps. The division inherited the Order of Kutuzov from the regiment. Its 381st Guards Air Landing Regiment was converted to an airborne regiment at some point. The division's Separate Air Landing Security Company was disbanded in 1949. On 15 November 1953, its 716th Separate Guards Communications Company became a battalion, along with the Separate Medical & Sanitary Company. The Separate Guards Antitank Battalion and Separate Guards Reconnaissance Company were disbanded on the same date. On 30 April 1955, the 109th Guards Airborne Regiment became part of the division after its original parent unit, the 100th Guards Airborne Division was disbanded. The 152nd Separate Tank Destroyer Battalion was activated on the same day. Due to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, two regiments of the division were placed on alert. On 1 November, the 114th and 381st Guards Airborne Regiments of the division landed at Veszpr√©m airport and T√∂k√∂l airport, along with the 7th Guards Airborne Division. It helped suppress the Hungarian uprising during Operation Whirlwind and took part in fighting in Budapest between 4‚Äì7 November. The division left Hungary in late November. During Operation Whirlwind, the division was commanded by P.M. Ryabov. 24 soldiers from the division were killed during the crushing of the Hungarian uprising. 114th Guards Airborne Regiment company commander Mikhail Zinukov, 381st Guards Airborne Regiment deputy company commander Nikolai Muravlev, and 381st Guards Airborne Regiment platoon commander Pyotr Volokytin were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for their actions.

Landslide The landslide occurred in the early morning hours, when a man-made heap of waste soil mined out of the nearby jade mine collapsed. Many of those killed were people living in a small village near the waste heap, including both miners and others who had scavenged through the waste soil looking for jade remnants to sell. The cause of the collapse is not known. Rescue efforts by the Myanmar Red Cross and other groups have been made to find and recover survivors; one person was pulled from the rubble alive, but subsequently died from injuries. At least 116 bodies have been reported as having been recovered. Around a hundred people have been reported as missing. The total number of casualties cannot be accurately estimated, as the precise number of people living near the site is not known. According to a Hpakant Township General Administration Department official, people had been warned to avoid living near the waste heap because of its potential for landslides. Investigation The jade industry in Myanmar generates estimated annual revenues of US$31 billion. It is presently unclear which companies are responsible for the waste dump, although it is known that prior to the 2015 democratic election, many of these were controlled by the military leadership of the country, leading to questionable safety practices and corruption. Deaths from similar landslides are common, but none of the scale of the Hpakant landslide. A spokesman for the National League for Democracy party said they will investigate the companies and the practices that led to this disaster.

It was founded in 2001 in Innsbruck under the name Private University of Medical Computer Science and Technology Tirol. In connection with the expansion of the health sciences in 2004, the university was re-named UMIT ‚Äì Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology. Today, it's a private university under the University Accreditation Act UniAkkG BGBl. The university is run by Tyrol (90 percent) and the University of Innsbruck (10 percent).  History  The Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL was founded in 2001 as a subsidiary of Tirol Kliniken GmbH‚Äîformerly (until June 23, 2015) TILAK Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten‚Äî(74.93 %) and Tiroler Zukunftsstiftung (25.07%). The first course offered were a bachelor's and a master's degree in Medical Informatics. The Tyrolean Private University UMIT was accredited by the Austrian Accreditation Council (√ñAR) on 16 November 2001 for a period of five years. In the winter semester 2004/2005 the Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL moved from Innsbruck to Hall in Tyrol to a newly established campus (Eduard-Walln√∂fer-Zentrum). In 2006 the accreditation by the Austrian Accreditation Council was extended until 2011 after an international assessment. As a shareholder of the Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL, Tyrol endeavors to expand its excellent reputation in the field of health care through research and teaching at the highest level, on the one hand, and to strengthen the scientific location, on the other. On 13 September 2010, the √ñAR canceled the accreditation for the doctoral program in Health Sciences due to a lack of qualitative supervision due to a large number of students and due to serious shortcomings both in the implementation and in the scientific orientation of the program. The poor quality of the dissertations was also deplored, for example in the subject of health sciences dissertations were written which had no relation to health and therefore should not have been accepted. The other bachelor's, master's, and doctorate programs were not affected by this decision. Following an international review, the √ñAR was able to grant accreditation to seven new doctoral programs at the Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL in 2011. The basis for the √ñAR's decision was the assessment by six independent, international, external experts who subjected the Tyrolean private university to an intensive analysis and evaluation over several months. In the same year 2011, after further international evaluation, the Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL was re-accredited for the third time until 2016 and meanwhile until 2021. In the academic year 2012/13, a new high was reached with 432 first-year students. In 2014, a branch was established in Landeck. In 2014, at the initiative of the state, the shareholder structure of UMIT TIROL was adapted in order to give the University of Innsbruck a ten percent stake in UMIT TIROL. This will bring the University of Innsbruck and UMIT TIROL closer together in the direction of a \\"Campus Tirol\\". This is intended to strengthen future cooperation between the Tyrolean universities. Since autumn 2016, the university bachelor's program in mechatronics at the Campus Technik Lienz in East Tyrol has been offered jointly by the Tyrolean private university UMIT TIROL and the Leopold Franzens University of Innsbruck. In 2020, after a legal dispute with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the university changed its brand name to UMIT TIROL - The Tyrolean Private University.  Organisation  The Tyrolean Private University UMIT GesmbH holds shares in other companies and competence centers. The university's highest organs are the Scientific Advisory Board, the Vice- Chancellor's Office with the vice-chancellor and the deputy vice-chancellor and the Senate.  Department structure  The Tyrolean Private University UMIT TIROL is divided into four departments with several subordinate institutes * Department of Nursing Science and Gerontology * Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology Assessment * Department of Psychology and Medical Sciences * Department of Biomedical Computer Science and Mechatronics  Locations  UMIT does not only offer its study programs at the campus in Hall but also maintains study centers at various locations, for example since 2014 in Landeck and 2016 in Lienz.

After the amendment of the Austrian Student Union Act (HSG) in February 2005, students at private universities were no longer members of the √ñH, UMIT TIROL was one of the first private universities in Austria to establish its own student representation (name: StuVe). An amendment to the HSG 2014 established an √ñH representation at each private university, as at the public universities. √ñH UMIT has been responsible for UMIT TIROL students since 1 October 2014.

It is located in 1-1-1 Fujimi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan. Ambassador Jose Laurel V, the current Philippine ambassador to Japan, currently resides in the building. History Kudan is named after nearby Kudanzaka hilltop. Its address 1-1-1 Fujimi translates as ‚Äúa view of Mt. Fuji.‚Äù The residence was built within a land in the Tokugawa shogunate, by Iwajiro Yasuda, a member of the family of prominent businessman Yasuda Zenjir≈ç in the 1930s. It was originally known as the Yasuda Mansion. Zenjiro Yasuda founded Yasuda Zaibatsu and the Fuji group of companies. He is also the great-grandfather of artist Yoko Ono. Iwajiro, a painter, originally inherited a family home in Kamakura but decided to build a new house in Tokyo. He commissioned the Yokogawa Construction and Takenaka Corporation to build his new house. Tokisuke Yokogawa served as architect. Construction started in March 1933 and was completed in January 1935. The building is built on the takadai or a high place in the city and is mainly patterned after Iberian styles and a mix of Renaissance, Gothic, Spanish, and Nippon styles. It was built using Japanese materials, including tiles from Toyama Prefecture. The design of the rooms were patterned after the hobbies of Yasuda's son. World War II came and the Yasuda suffered financial problem. He sold his residence to President Jose P. Laurel for one million yen. Laurel bought the Yasuda property for the Philippine government in Tokyo on 31 March 1944. Since then, it served as the official residence of the Philippine ambassador to Tokyo and for socio-cultural affairs of Filipinos in Japan. On 9 March 1952, the National Historical Committee (precursor of NHCP), installed a commemorative plaque on Kudan which highlights the history of the building and its purchase by President Laurel in 1944. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) declared the Kudan property as a National Historical Landmark through signing Resolution no. 1, series of 2013. The unveiling of the marker happened on March 3, 2014 in the presence of Ambassador Lopez, NHCP chair Dr. Maria Serena Diokno, and Japanese and Filipino officials. Kudan is the first officially designated Philippine national historical landmark outside Philippine soil. In the unveiling of the marker, Lopez called the building as the crown jewel of Philippine foreign service. Features Kudan consists of a basement, two storeys, and a watch tower. It is adjacent to the Tokyo Imperial Palace grounds and the Yasukuni Shrine. It boasts of its black ornate grill-gate and a Castilian rotunda, The roof tiles were also reminiscent of Castilian architecture. Located in the foyer are busts of Jose Rizal, Philippines' national hero and President Laurel. It has four function rooms on the ground floor: the diplomatic or blue room where guests are usually entertained; two dining rooms; and a music room. The second floor served as a private quarters of the ambassador and his family. Five other rooms on the second floor can be used by guests. Adjacent to the building is a garden where Princess Hitachi planted a sakura tree in 1994. In popular culture In 2015, Philippine historian Ambeth Ocampo published the history of the Kudan entitled, History and Heritage of the Kudan: the Official Residence of the Philippine Ambassador to Japan. Its publication by ArtPost Asia is in time for the 60 anniversary of diplomatic relations with Japan.

Following the war, the ship was converted for mercantile use and entered service as SS Wellington Kent in 1947. In 1951, the ship was renamed Belle Isle II. In 1960, Belle Isle II was sunk in a collision. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessors and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p.129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Construction and career Woolvesey Castle, named after a castle in Winchester, was ordered on 23 January 1943. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1943 by Ailsa Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. at Troon and was launched on 24 February 1944. At some point during 1943 the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. Renamed Huntsville after a community in northern Ontario, the corvette was commissioned on 6 June 1944 with the pennant number K499. Following her commissioning, Huntsville was sent to Stornoway to work up and joined the Mid- Ocean Escort Force escort group C-5 as a convoy escort. In November, Huntsville was in Halifax, Nova Scotia under repair when her group sailed without her. She was then ordered to act as a local escort, protecting a convoy travelling from St. John's to New York City. The corvette then returned to ocean-crossing convoys in December and continued in this fashion until May 1945. In May 1945, Huntsville underwent a refit at Halifax which was completed in August and was placed in reserve the following month. The ship was paid off on 15 February 1946 and sold later that year for mercantile use. Converted to a cargo ship with a gross register tonnage of 1,529 tons, the ship was initially owned by the Kent Line and had a port of registry in St. John's. In 1947 the ship entered service as SS Wellington Kent. In 1951, the ship was sold to Chebucto Steamships Ltd and renamed Belle Isle II. Her port of registry also changed to Halifax. On 19 August 1960, Belle Isle II was sunk in a collision off Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec. Belle Isle II was hit by the merchant vessel Holmside on Lake Saint Pierre while at anchor. The ship caught fire after the collision which gutted the ship. No casualties were involved, however the ship was a constructive total loss and was later salvaged by towing the hulk to Portsmouth, Ontario on 2 November. The ship was broken up at Whitby, Ontario in 1965‚Äì66.Miramar claims the ship was broken up at Sorel, Quebec in May 1964.

Nund Reshi was among the founders of the Rishi order, a Sufi tradition of the region. He was influenced by spiritual teachers and saints, including Hamza Makhdoom, Resh Mir S√†eb, and Shamas Faqir. Early life Noor-ud-Din was born in modern-day village Qaimoh in Kulgam district in 1377 AD to Salar Sanz and Sadra, also called Sadra Moji or Sadra Deddi.Soqte:School Of Orthoepy Quran And Theology::Kashmir His grandfather Sheikh Sala-Ud-Din hailed from Kishtwar. The legend has it that he refused to be breast-fed by his mother after birth and it was Lalleshwari who breastfed him. In teenage years Noor-ud-Din was apprenticed to a couple of traders. He was probably married to Zai Ded who hailed from the village of Dadasara, Tral and had two sons and a daughter with her. She renounced the world after the death of her children and became a hermit. Noor-ud-Din renounced the worldly life at the age of 30 and retired to live a life of meditation in a cave which is still shown in Qaimoh and is about 10 feet deep. During his last days, he survived by drinking a cup of milk every day, and later, he used to survive by drinking water. Literary works Noor-ud-Din spread his teachings or message through poems, commonly known as shruks. His poems have four to six lines each and evolve around religious themes, highlight moral principles and often call for peace. He strived for Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity. One of his prominent poem is Ann poshi teli yeli wan poshi, which translates as \\"Food will thrive only till the woods survive\\". A Kashmiri poetess Lal Ded was his contemporary and had a great impact on his spiritual growth.Jaishree Odin, Lalla to Nuruddin: Rishi-Sufi Poetry of Kashmir. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass (2013) Some scholars argue that he was her disciple, and associate his poetry with the Bhakti movement, although others disagree. Noor-ud-Din witnessed several transmissions of Hinduism and Islam in the valley throughout his life, although he was actively involved in philosophical work and in writing Kashmiri poems. In his verses, he recalled some events, including arrival of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani to Kashmir. Noor-ud-Din is also credited with translating the Quran into Kashmiri language. In 2015, the university of Kashmir published an Urdu book titled \\"Kalam-i-Sheikh-ul-Alam\\", comprising about 300 shruks of Nund Rishi translated into Urdu by Ghulam Muhammad Shad. Death Noor-ud-Din died in 1438 at the approximate age of 63. Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin commissioned a tomb for his body at Charari Sharief. The Charar-e-Sharief shrine is visited by pilgrims to this day, especially on the eve of Noor-ud-Din's urs. The Afghan governor Atta Muhammad Khan minted coins with Noor-ud-Din's name. Noor-ud-Din's father Sheikh Salar-Ud-Din and two brothers Kamal-Ud-Din and Jamal-Ud-Din are buried near Dadasara while his wife is buried in Qaimoh. Legacy Noor-ud-Din's sayings and verses are preserved in Kashmir region, including in a museum built at Kashmir university. The shruks also describe the life of the saint. They were translated into the Persian language by Baba Nasib-ud-din Ghazi two centuries after his death. In 1998, University of Kashmir established an institute called Markaz-e-Noor Centre for Sheikh-ul-Alam Studies to conduct scientific research on Noor-ud-Din's life. In 2015, the university established a research center called Sheikh-ul-Alam Chair in order to honor his reachings. The centre is aimed at exploring the social and cultural background of the Kashmiri Rishis. In 2017, the Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages covered his life in a book titled \\"Hayat-e-Sheikh-ul-Alam\\" (life of Nund Rishi). In 2005, the Government of India renamed the Srinagar airport to Sheikh ul-Alam International Airport and granted it international status.

From 1978 to 1982, Smith led the Slapowitz Syndicate in the NWA's Mid-South and Knoxville territories as well as many \\"outlaw\\" promotions in the Southern United States. He also had brief stints in Georgia Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, Maple Leaf Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Federation. At various times his stable included Barry O, Bob Orton, Jr., Boris Malenko, Crusher Broomfield, James \\"Sugar Bear\\" Harris, The Mongolian Stomper, Randy Savage, Ray Candy, Rip Rogers and The Devil's Duo (Doug Vines and Jeff Sword). Early life Smith was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He became a wrestling fan in the late 1950s. A childhood friend claimed that they were the first wrestling fans to bring signs to local World Wide Wrestling Federation house shows. Around 1971, Smith also co- founded an unofficial fan club for Freddie Blassie with members wearing homemade \\"Blassie's Army\\" T-shirts. In his early 20‚Äôs Smith had an altercation with Kevin Sullivan while attending a live event at Sunnyside Gardens. Sullivan had been hit with an unknown object at the end of his bout against Davey O'Hannon. Smith, who often cheered for the \\"heel\\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \\"babyface\\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland. Smith denied any wrongdoing and was allowed to leave. Smith continued watching wrestling after moving to Knoxville, Tennessee in the mid-1970s. He eventually met Norvell Austin at a Southeastern Championship Wrestling. Austin later introduced Smith to Rick Conner who agreed to train him. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Smith made his pro debut in 1976. He spent the next two years wrestling for \\"outlaw\\" promotions as \\"Pretty Smitty from New York City\\" in Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. One of his earliest matches was a battle royal in which all the participants wore masks. Smith had never been in such an event and, after being thrown over the top rope, broke his leg in three places. He was pelted with Coke cans and other items by unruly fans while paramedics loaded him into the ambulance. The crowd's reaction convinced him to perform as a \\"heel\\" for the majority of his career. On September 16, 1978, Smith (substituting for Tamaya Soto) wrestled Burr Head Jones for an NWA Mid-America television taping at the Memorial Auditorium in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He later felt the match was \\"garbage\\". Smith attributed his poor performance to nervousness as he was used to wrestling in front of much smaller crowds. After the match, Smith was berated by promoter Nick Gulas in front of the entire locker room. Although Gulas' booker Tom Renesto reassured Smith that he was welcome to return, Smith felt Gulas had acted unprofessionally and refused to work for him again. =American Wrestling Association= Not long after, Smith was brought into George and Gil Culkin's American Wrestling Association-affiliated promotion in Mississippi. Smith's old trainer Rick Conner recommended him to then booker Frankie Caine praising his interview skills. Caine decided to use Smith as a manager believing he had potential as an on-screen character. Smith credited Caine for creating the Izzy Slapawitz character and working with him to further develop the gimmick. Slapawitz was initially presented as a shady New York City businessman who owned a chain of pawn shops throughout the city. In first television appearance, however, Southern audiences mistook \\"pawn shop\\" for \\"porn shop\\" due Smith's thick New York accent. His introduction elicited some mild controversy at the time and that aspect of the character was quickly dropped. In spite of this rough start, Smith was well liked by Caine and the Culkins. He formed the first version of the Slapawitz Syndicate with Rip Rogers and The Japanese Wrecking Crew (Oki Shikina and Mr. Fuji). One of the first targets of the Slapawitz Syndicate was Joey Rossi who was harassed by the group, and Smith in particular, for several weeks while the Culkins were running shows in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Smith was unexpectedly forced into a bout with Rossi which led to the manager wrestling his first-ever match in the territory. Unlike the typical \\"cowardly\\" wrestling manager, Smith aggressively brawled with Rossi and was disqualified in their best two of three falls match. The bout was covered by the Vicksburg's daily newspaper with a front-page story entitled \\"Tougher Then They Thought\\". Shikina and Fugi quickly captured the promotion's Mississippi and U.S. Heavyweight Championships under Slapawitz's leadership. Smith's stable soon became involved in a \\"heel vs. heel\\" feud against Percy Pringle and AWA Tag Team Champions The Mongolians (Tio and Tapu). Slapawitz and Pringle faced each other in six-man tag team matches as well as in a variety of specialty matches throughout Mississippi in 1978. One of their most infamous matches was a bloody Texas Bull Rope match at the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson, Mississippi that ended in a double-countout when the brawl spilled outside of the ring and into the backstage area. The feud concluded the following week at the Mississippi Coliseum with Slapawitz and The Japanese Wrecking Crew defeating Pringle and The Mongolians in a \\"Loser Leaves Town\\" Steel Cage match; due to the pre-match stipulations, the Slapawitz Syndicate won all four titles in addition to $5,000. Slapawitz remained with the promotion until the Culkins rejoined Bill Watts at the end of 1979. Smith praised the Culkins for their honesty calling them the \\"two of the finest promoters, in my experience, that ever promoted wrestling matches in the United States\\". Although Smith had never worked for Mid-South Wrestling, Watts compared \\"Izzy Slapawitz\\" to Paul E. Dangerously when the two first met in World Championship Wrestling. =NWA Tri-State= After leaving Mississippi, Smith followed Frankie Caine to the NWA's Oklahoma territory where he managed Oki Shikina and James \\"Sugar Bear\\" Harris. Then NWA Tri-State promoter Leroy McGuirk felt that the \\"Izzy Slapawitz\\" name might offend the large Jewish American population in Tulsa and changed it to Ilya Zinervitch. When Caine left the promotion after a falling out with McGuirk, Skandor Akbar replaced him as booker. Akbar believed that the territory could only support one \\"heel\\" manager, however, he offered to put Smith under hood so he could wrestle as a masked wrestler. Smith turned him down as had been on the road for a considerable length of time and wanted to return to Knoxville so he could spend more time with his family. Smith and Harris left the territory after losing a \\"loser leaves town\\" match to Jimmy Garvin in Little Rock, Arkansas. =All-Star Championship Wrestling= Smith joined a local \\"outlaw\\" promotion called All-Star Championship Wrestling soon after returning to Knoxville. The organization was formed by Ronnie Garvin, Bob Roop, Bob Orton, Jr. and Boris Malenko after leaving Southeastern Championship Wrestling and was running in opposition to NWA promoter Robert Fuller. Yasu Fuji, one of his former charges, encouraged Smith to contact then booker Ronnie Garvin. Although the territory was struggling in its promotional war against Fuller, Garvin agreed to hire him. In January 1980, Smith made his first television appearance scouting for new talent. Initially managing Bob Orton, Jr. and Barry O, this new version of the Slapawitz Syndicate included Boris Malenko, Randy Savage, Rip Rogers, and Tony Peters. Peters quickly won the ICW Southeastern Heavyweight Championship under his management. Smith led his stable against Ronnie Garvin, Bob Roop and other fan favorites. One of the highlights during this period was when Smith faked a heart attack during a match with Roop to avoid wrestling him. On January 19, 1980, Smith was in the corner of Bob Orton, Jr. in a \\"loser gets painted yellow\\" match against Ronnie Garvin at WNOX Auditorium. If Garvin won, Smith would have been forced to spend 2 minutes in the ring with him. On March 15, Smith teamed with The Destroyer in a handicap match against Garvin. Two weeks later, Garvin was lured into a \\"loser leaves town\\" match in exchange for a title shot against Tony Peters. Smith, however, was barred from ringside during the bout. A brawl between members of the Slapawitz Syndicate and Ronnie Garvin at the WNOX Auditorium resulted in Smith throwing a fireball for the first time in the territory. Smith's actions caused a riot with fans tearing the seats out of the floor and throwing them at the wrestlers. Smith and his men were able to escape the building unharmed. A fan pulled a knife on Smith outside but he was disarmed by Tony Peters. The incident caused All Star Wrestling to lose access to the venue. On April Fools' Day, he led the Orton brothers to the Southern Tag Team Championship when they defeated Terry Gibbs and Bob Roop. Barry O was replaced by Tony Peters after leaving the territory. On May 24, 1980, Smith led his Southern Tag Team Champions against Garvin and Terry Gibbs at Evans- Collins Field. =International Championship Wrestling= All Star Wrestling was closely associated with another \\"outlaw\\" promotion, International Championship Wrestling, based in Lexington, Kentucky. When All Star merged with ICW, Smith was among the wrestlers who opted to join the sister promotion in Lexington, Kentucky. Smith and other All Star Wrestling stars were regulars on ICW's weekly television show prior to and following the merger. Slapawitz Syndicate members Barry Orton and Tony Peters did not make the move to Kentucky The ICW version of the Slapawitz Syndicate consisted of Bob Orton Jr., Crusher Broomfield, Rip Rogers, and the Devil's Duo (Doug Vines and Jeff Sword). Randy Savage and his manager Steve Cooper were also members for a time, most notably during their feud with midget wrestler Wee Willie. Smith's look varied depending on the territory he worked. In Knoxville, he dressed in a black robe and sported long bushy hair and beard. In real-life, Smith would sometime have trouble getting a hotel room because of his appearance. He also carried a whistle which he used to annoy fans at ringside. Smith and his stable continued their feud against the fan favorites of the territory. In August 1980, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were involved in a controversial angle when they interfered in a match between Barry O and Ronnie Garvin. As Orton distracted the referee, Smith injected Garvin with an unknown substance that made the wrestler \\"foam at the mouth\\". ICW officials immediately disqualified Barry O and suspended Bob Orton, Jr. from a championship tournament to crown the first ICW Television Champion. Orton was able to sneak into the tournament as the masked wrestler The Best but was eliminated by Bob Roop in the quarter- finals. In the following weeks, Smith and Bob Orton, Jr. were hounded about the identity of The Best. On the September 6th edition of International Championship Wrestling, Lanny Poffo brought out a sports bag he \\"found\\" to the announcers desk while Orton (with Smith in his corner) wrestled \\"Pistol\\" Pez Whatley. Searching the bag, he showed co-announcer John Back and the studio audience the mask and wrestling tights worn by The Best. He quickly put the items back inside and returned backstage. Smith eventually noticed the bag on the desk, unaware that Poffo had opened the bag, and began blowing his whistle at Orton. The panicked wrestler left the ring, grabbed the sports bag, and hurried with Smith back to the locker room. Orton was counted out as a result. Later on, Bob Roop confronted Smith and Orton with the bag during a TV interview. When Orton insisted the bag was not his, Roop used a knife to rip it into shreds to see Orton‚Äôs reaction. To the crowd's amusement, Orton was clearly distraught as the expensive bag was destroyed. Smith and Orton showed up the following week's episode and brought out midget wrestler Mighty Cupid who claimed the $500 bag was his. In an attempt to garner sympathy with the crowd, Orton promised to take the $500 out on Roop. On September 20, 1980, the Devil's Duo made their ICW television debut with an impressive win over George Weingeroff and Jim Pride. The team's name was created by promoter Angelo Poffo who was part of the original Devil's Duo with Chris Markoff and manager Bobby Heenan during the 1960s. As their manager, Smith accompanied them to the ring holding a book he called the \\"Kaba Kaba\\" and muttering supposedly occult phrases. These theatrical hints of mock-satanism helped to put the team over with the fans but also limited their exposure, as many other territories at that time were too 'Bible Belt' for any satanism gimmick to be used. Nevertheless, the team quickly established themselves as top contenders for the promotion's U.S. and Southeastern Tag Team titles. On April 25, 1981, Smith led the Devil's Duo to the ICW United States Tag Team Championship, which they won from Lanny Poffo and George Weingeroff at Henry Clay High School. He threw a fireball to help his team win the tag team title. Shortly after their victory, Smith went on live TV to congratulate his team for winning the belts and bragged to the crowd about the amount of \\"fan mail\\" his champions had received. He also mentioned a letter from \\"his cousin overseas\\" and suddenly displayed a picture of Ayatollah Khomeini. This upset many in audience as the U.S. was still in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis. Smith continued to taunt the crowd and ended by turning to the camera asking \\"Oh yeah? Well, how many hostages do YOU have?\\". Before the end of the show, a mob had formed outside the TV studio. The wrestlers were trapped in the building until a police escort arrived. The promotion had to arrange special security for the trio for the next several months. On May 6, Smith and the Devil's Duo entered in a $10,000 battle royal held in Frankfort, Kentucky. Smith was one of the final three participants along with Jeff Sword and Ronnie Garvin. As Garvin was attempting a piledriver on Sword, a masked man entered the ring, climbed to the top rope and hit Garvin with a 2x4. This allowed Sword to toss Garvin out of the ring. The masked wrestler, later called The Destroyer, turned his attention towards the two remaining men. Still holding the 2x4, The Destroyer stared them down but withdrew when Doug Vines joined his teammates. Smith was declared the winner of the battle royal. On his way out of the ring, Smith dropped the $10,000 check. A fan picked it up and saw it had \\"void\\" written across it. The promotion explained this by claiming that the ring check was ceremonial and that the winner would be given the actual one within a few days. That summer, Smith was attacked by fans during an ICW house show in Illinois. It was during a rematch against Poffo and Weingeroff that Smith secretly handed a chain to one of his men. The event was held in a high school gym without guardrails or security and angry fans were able to surround the manager. Poffo and Weingeroff convinced the crowd to hand Smith to them and the wrestlers quickly rushed him back to the dressing room. Smith sustained a swollen knee from the assault and believed that he would have sustained more serious injuries had his opponents not intervened. It was this incident that led to his decision to leave the territory. Smith blamed Angelo Poffo for not hiring security to work at the event which led to a verbal altercation with the promoter. Poffo ordered Smith and his team to turn over the tag team belts. He also had Slapawitz Syndicate member Barry Orton, Jr. surrender his Southeastern title. But Smith was not alone as many others had grown tired of the excessive traveling, low payoffs and poor working conditions. The Poffo family's feud with Jerry Jarrett and the Continental Wrestling Association had also alienated Smith and others who had friends in the Memphis territory. Smith and the Devil's Duo were the first of many ICW mainstays who left during the summer and fall of 1981. Smith and the Devil's Duo were considered the promotion's top \\"heel\\" tag team at the time of their departure. Angelo Poffo later blamed Smith for the loss of talent. Despite the falling out between him and the Poffos, Smith spoke highly of the tight-knit comradery among the ICW roster. The Devil's Duo dropped the belts back to Lanny Poffo and George Weingeroff in Owenton, Kentucky on June 15, 1981. Smith did not appear for the show, and all three members left the promotion shortly after this event. Prior to this, Randy Savage had left the Slapawitz Syndicate and had put a $2000 bounty on the manager. On the July 25th 1981 edition of International Championship Wrestling, Randy Savage aired a video of he and The Destroyer \\"taking out\\" Slapawitz with the masked wrestler collecting the reward. =NWA Hollywood Wrestling= As he was preparing to leave ICW, Smith got an offer from Tom Renesto who was booking for the NWA's Los Angeles territory. Renesto wanted him to appear for its annual battle royal at the Olympic Auditorium where he would win the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship. The Devil's Duo were also to have a title run with the NWA Americas Tag Team Championships. Smith and his men planned to go in late 1981. The three backed out at the last minute, however, as the Knoxville territory was doing so well and were also being discouraged from wrestlers coming back from Los Angeles. NWA Hollywood Wrestling closed down the following year. =Southern Championship Wrestling= Shortly after leaving ICW, Smith joined Southern Championship Wrestling based Knoxville, Tennessee. Owned by Blackjack Mulligan and Ric Flair, the small promotion also had the backing of NWA Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling owner Jim Crockett, Jr.. Smith contacted Kevin Sullivan who was booking for SCW and agreed to use him albeit on the bottom of the card. Smith's first appearance was a house show in Virginia where he was a last-minute replacement for The Mongolian Stomper in the tag team main event against Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Mulligan, Jr.. Neither Smith or the promoters were aware that they were in an area where local wrestling fans received ICW television. The crowd immediately recognized Smith as Izzy Slapowitz and loudly booed him as he entered the ring. The strong fan reaction impressed Blackjack Mulligan and used Smith as a mid-card performer for the rest of the time in the promotion. Sullivan also remembered Smith from the Sunnyside Gardens incident ten years earlier. The wrestler no longer held a grudge towards Smith and they became good friends while in the promotion. Two weeks after Slapawitz's debut, the Devil's Duo were brought into the territory from ICW. Many of the Virginia towns that SCW ran in, such as Lynchburg, Virginia, were part of the Bible Belt and it was felt that the name might turn off fans from attending shows. The team's name was changed to \\"The Hollywood Blondes\\" and they were initially managed by Jimmy Holiday. Smith rejoined the Devil's Duo when Holiday left to work in the Mid-Atlantic territory. Smith held dual roles as both a manager and wrestler during this period. He mainly appeared in a \\"wrestling manager\\" role for Mulligan's shows in the Knoxville end of the territory and wrestled for the co-promotional shows with Crockett's side of the territory in Central Virginia area. Among his opponents included Ron Wright and Dennis Brown, defeating the latter in bouts at the Salem Civic Center and the Roanoke Civic Center. Smith also wrestled both Terry Taylor and his former trainer Rick Connors to time-limit draws on SCW television. Additionally, he accompanied Kevin Sullivan and Ray Candy as a manager. =Georgia Championship Wrestling= Smith was among the SCW roster Mulligan sent to Georgia Championship Wrestling television tapings. In the fall of 1981, Smith made a number of appearances at WTBS Studios in Atlanta. His first GCW television appearance was a tag team match with Dave Forrester against George Wells and Steve O on the September 12th 1981 edition of Georgia Championship Wrestling. Smith teamed with Iron Mike Sharpe against Wells and Bruno Sammartino Jr. the following week. In his last GCW appearance, Smith and Jose Medina lost to The Oates Brothers (Jerry Oates and Ted Oates) on the October 3rd 1981 episode of Georgia Championship Wrestling. =Maple Leaf Wrestling= On November 15, 1981, Smith and Doug Vines made a one-time appearance in Maple Leaf Wrestling for their 50th anniversary show at Maple Leaf Gardens where they lost to Mike Davis and Tony Parisi. Smith had been sent to Canada by Mulligan for a one-time appearance. However, the Tunney family were so impressed by Smith that they made him an offer to work in the Toronto wrestling territory the morning he was checking out of his hotel. Smith declined the offer as he did not want to move his family to Canada. While at the show, Smith was photographed backstage with Charlie Fulton and Mike Miller watching Big John Studd demonstrating a facerake on Doug Vines. The photo became part of a feature story entitled \\"The John Studd School of Rulebreaking\\" which was published in The Wrestler several months later. Stu Saks later claimed that one of the few articles he had pulled from the Apter magazines was an Izzy Slapowitz story written by then columnist Steve Farhood. =Jim Crockett Promotions= Due to SCW's connection to Jim Crockett, Smith and the Devil's Duo were invited to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. One of their Crockett shows was at a state fair in Harrisonburg, Virginia on November 19, 1981. The local promoter had booked Smith to wrestle Doug Vines apparently unaware that \\"Izzy Slapowitz\\" was managing Vines in Knoxville. Smith knew the local fans would be confused, especially as the two wrestlers had spent the day walking around the fair. To protect kayfabe, the two decided to change the match at the last minute. Smith announced to the crowd that they were wrestling each other to show the audience how tough they were and vowed that \\"blood would be spilled\\". Smith and Vines then proceeded to wrestle a hardcore-style brawl, involving chairs and the ringposts, that ended in a double-disqualification. On December 26, 1981, Smith wrestled Abe Jacobs, the one-time \\"Jewish Heavyweight Champion\\", in Greenville, North Carolina losing via referee's decision. According to Smith, the Devil's Duo were originally going to compete in a championship tournament for the then vacant NWA Mid- Atlantic Tag Team Championship and win the titles. Ole Anderson, who was booking JCP at the time, instead split the trio up. In their first TV appearance for the company, Doug Vines and Jeff Sword wrestled in singles matches while Smith, whose name was changed, was put in a tag team match. When the three men returned to Knoxville the following day, they told Mulligan what had happened and the promoter drove to Charlotte where he confronted Anderson in the dressing room. Smith later speculated that their problems with Ole Anderson may have stemmed from real-life animosity between the two. The Devil's Duo remained the top \\"heel\\" tag team in SCW even after Crockett took full control of the Knoxville territory. The trio continued to have difficulty with Ole Anderson who cancelled many of their shows scheduled by assistant booker Johnny Weaver in early 1982. Smith decided to quit when all of his bookings were suddenly dropped except for a single show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The last-ever appearance of Slapawitz and Devil's Duo was supposed to be a six-man tag team match in Knoxville against Jimmy Snuka, Jimmy Valiant and Johnny Weaver. Dusty Rhodes had taken over as booker shortly afterwards. Smith had a very good relationship with Rhodes who expressed interest in using the Devil's Duo. Jeff Sword had lost interest in pro wrestling by this time and, after a brief stint as Assassin #2, left the business. =Later career= While Doug Vines stayed with JCP, Smith chose not to return to JCP. He began scaling back his wrestling schedule during the mid-to-late 1980s. His last major run was working for Bill Needham's All Star Championship Wrestling in northeastern Tennessee. One of his most memorable moments in the promotion was when he faked a heart attack during a bare knuckles match against Rick Conner in 1990. It was also in ASCW that Smith was reunited with The Devil's Duo. The team won the ASCW Tag Team Championship twice and Doug Vines won the ASCW Heavyweight Championship five times. On January 8, 1991, he made a brief appearance on WWF Wrestling Challenge taping against Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts at UTC Arena in Chattanooga. Retirement Smith went into retirement after the close of ASCW in 1992. He returned to New York and worked as an insurance salesman until the mid-2000s due to health problems. In 2007, Smith underwent emergency ascending aortic dissection surgery. The lengthy recovery period and blood pressure medication he was put on prevented him from working as a sales rep. Smith was still receiving cardiac therapy for his heart four years after his surgery. In May 2011, he was interviewed by Canadian Online Explorer regarding the death of Randy Savage. On September 18, 2011, Smith was among the featured guests at the Legends Show in Knoxville's Chilhowee Park. It was his first public appearance as \\"Izzy Slapowitz\\" in 20 years. Smith was also invited to the private Tennessee Wrestling Legends Reunion in Gallatin, Tennessee a year later. On February 13, 2013, Smith was interviewed on the Mantell's Corral podcast with Johnny Mantell where he discussed his career and shared road stories. He also expressed concerns that younger wrestlers no longer had access to the unique training environment the NWA territory system provided to learn the craft of pro wrestling. Internet writings =Involvement in the \\"internet wrestling community\\"= Since 2001, Smith was involved in the internet wrestling community interacting with fans on KayfabeMemories.com and WrestlingClassics.com. He was briefly a KayfabeMemories.com guest columnist in 2004. In 2008, Smith participated in a \\"shoot interview\\" available on DVD. =Political commentator= A Jewish- American conservative, Smith was a member of the Libertarian Party of New York in Queens. He revived his \\"Izzy Slapawitz\\" character for a series of YouTube videos between June 2011 and September 2012 discussing the debt ceiling crisis, free speech, right-to-work legislation, support for Israel, and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.

It was formed when the Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway (opened 1858) merged with the Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction Railway, partly opened in the same year. The merger and change of title took place in 1860. The line joined the Dunstable branch of the London and North Western Railway at Dunstable. For some time the HL&DR; was the only railway at Luton, and the early industry took considerable benefit from it, and later industry was encouraged by it. Even when the competing direct line from Luton to London was opened, the route via Hatfield held its own for some time. The Hertford extremity did not fare so well, and remained rural and relatively undeveloped throughout its life. Passenger services on the Hatfield to Hertford line ended in 1951; those between Hatfield and Dunstable ended in 1965. Goods traffic did not last much longer. A guided busway was installed on the trackbed between Luton and Dunstable in 2003. Origins: Dunstable, but not Luton at first The Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway on full openingThe London and Birmingham Railway opened its line in 1838, passing Leighton, later named Leighton Buzzard. Luton and Dunstable were important manufacturing towns, and in 1841 a scheme was put forward for a branch line from Leighton to Dunstable and Luton. George Stephenson planned a scheme for the line, but there was opposition from Luton interests to some of the public land that was to be taken, and the scheme failed. A shorter line simply reaching Dunstable from Leighton seemed to be less difficult, and as the scheme had the support of the London and Birmingham Railway, proposals were submitted to Parliament. The result that the Dunstable Railway ActFormally the Dunstable & London & Birmingham Railway Act. was given the Royal Assent on 30 June 1845, with capital of ¬£50,000.Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, pages 102 and 103Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, volume 9: the East Midlands, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 30Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 30Keith Scholey, Bedfordshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2004, , pages 11 to 14G and S Woodward, The Hatfield, Luton and Dunstable Railway, Oakwood Press, Trowbridge, 1971, , pages 6 to 13 In 1846 the London and Birmingham Railway amalgamated with others and formed the London and North Western Railway. The Dunstable line was opened for traffic on 1 June 1848. There was one intermediate station, at Stanbridgeford, although it was not ready for opening until the year after the line started operation. It was worked from the outset by the London and North Western Railway, and the new line was effectively the Dunstable branch of the LNWR and was purchased by that company on the opening of the line for the sum of ¬£2,952 Luton interests press for a railway Ayot stationLuton was said at the time to be the largest town in England not connected to a railway or a canal.James Dyer, Frank Edward Stygall and John G Dony, The Story of Luton, White Crescent Press, 1977, , page 125, quoting \\"the compilers of the 1851 census\\".The Midland Main Line through was not ready for passenger traffic until 1868. Local interests complained that they did not have a good transport system for their products, A meeting in Luton in 1845 resolved that the solution for their town was not a branch line giving a roundabout connection, but a London to Manchester main line railway via Luton. This was an ambitious scheme that would be in competition with the LNWR and to some extent the Great Northern Railway for long distance traffic and for mineral business, and would certainly not be assisted by them. The resolution does not seem to have led to anything.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 264 The Great Northern Railway Luton Hoo station in the 1980sIf the London and Birmingham Railway and its successor the LNWR were the great trunk railway to the north on the west side of the country, another was in the process of building on the east side: the Great Northern Railway was to connect London and York, at first by a rather roundabout route. It opened part of its main line, between a London station and Peterborough on 7 August 1850. During the construction process the GNR directors saw that it was important to secure areas of territory for their own railway by building branches within the area. If a company had a useful branch line in an area, Parliament would be reluctant to authorise a rival line in the same area. Accordingly the Great Northern Railway promoted a line that became known as the Hertford, Hatfield and St Albans Railway; it was not independent, but was promoted directly by the GNR. It was authorised by the Great Northern Railway Act of 22 July 1847. It was to build a line from Hatfield (on the GNR main line) to St Albans and also from Hatfield to Hertford. Authorised capital was ¬£300,000. The year 1847 marked the end of the Railway Mania, and suddenly money for railway schemes was to become unobtainable, and nothing more was heard of this authorised railway. The St Albans line was built later under a fresh authorisation.There is a confusing passage on Woodward, page 7: The Act of 22 July 1847 \\"authorised the building of a branch line from St Albans to the Hertford station of the Hertford ‚Äì Ware branch... with connections to the Great Northern in the Hatfield District. However progress was very slow‚Äîpurchase of land was still being negotiated in 1853‚Äîbut eventually it was built and opened on the 21st October 1865.\\" This may refer to the (different) Hatfield to St Albans line, but according to Leleux (page 32), that line opened on 16 October 1865.Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, pages 182 and 183Woodward, page 7Leleux, page 32 Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway Hertford already had a railway, completed in 1843. It was the terminus of a branch line of the Northern and Eastern Railway, which was being worked by the Eastern Counties Railway. The Hertford station was somewhat to the east of the present-day Hertford East station.D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, , pages 121 to 123 As the money market stabilised, it became possible to propose new lines. The Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway got its Act on 3 July 1854; it was to build from the Eastern Counties Railway terminus at Hertford (converting it to a through station).There was no passenger service intended between the Hatfield line and the ECR line, so the new line simply needed to run to the goods yard. The ECR station was relocated 300 yards west in 1888, to form what is now Hertford East station via a Cowbridge station near the centre of Hertford to a new Welwyn Junction station, at the south end of Digswell Viaduct on the GNR. There was to be a triangular junction there, and the new company would have running powers into Welwyn station (now Welwyn North, and located at the north end of the viaduct). Authorised capital was ¬£65,000.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 264Carter, page 251Gordon, page 123John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume 1: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 125 to 127 Welwyn stations The valley of the River Mimram runs west to east at Digswell, and the Digswell Viaduct carries the East Coast Main Line of the Great Northern Railway over it. Welwyn was a small community at that time, and there was a Welwyn station at the north end of the viaduct; this station is now named Welwyn North. Welwyn Garden City was not inaugurated as a community until 1920.Claire Edwards and Rob Imrie, The Short Guide to Urban Policy, Policy Press, Bristol, 2015, , page 146 The triangular junction was to be located at the south end of the viaduct; the intention of the promoters of the Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway was to provide for direct southward running to London from Hertford at the junction, but also direct northward running to the Welwyn [North] station, which would become the junction station for passengers to the branch. There were to be running powers for goods trains as far as Ware. In fact when the line was constructed, these intentions were altered. A new Welwyn Junction station was opened, a little north of the present-day Welwyn Garden City station, immediately on the north side of Hunter's Bridge, which nowadays carries Bridge Road over the railway. This was considered a preferable interchange for the branch, and the proposed north curve of the triangle was never built.Grant, page 264Woodward, page 9 Opening of the Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway The line was opened to goods traffic on 28 February 1858 (a Sunday) and to passengers on Monday 1 March 1858. It was operated jointly by the GNR and the Eastern Counties Railway, and there were some through bookings between their respective stations. The line also provided a useful route to the London docks for goods traffic to and from the GNR; there were sidings at Welwyn Junction where the traffic was exchanged. A Luton line authorised at last Luton GNR station with a special train in 1964In the following Parliamentary session, a branch line to serve Luton was authorised: the Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction Railway was authorised on 16 July 1855. The authorised capital of the LD&WJR; was ¬£108,000.Woodward says ¬£120,000, page 8, as does Wrottesley, page 126 Carter, page 264 It would be a single line railway, with earthworks and bridges constructed for later conversion to double track; it would run from a junction with the LNWR at Dunstable to the GNR at Welwyn, where there would also be a triangular junction. There would be a connecting line at Digswell with the Hertford line.The northern curve was never built; nor was the connecting line, which would have crossed the GNR main line on the level. W F Cowper MP was Chairman of this company and of the Hertford and Welwyn Junction company, and the clear intention was that the two companies would work collaborativelyWoodward, pages 7 and 8 The Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction Railway Act authorised it to raise the capital, it was a more difficult matter to actually get subscriptions. This delayed land acquisition seriously, and the directors approached the LNWR, hoping to lease the line to the larger company; the LNWR were not interested. The next proposal was to merge the two local companies. The two lines could be joined at Welwyn by crossing the Great Northern Railway by a bridge linking them,saving money, instead of connecting into the GNR line. This was opposed by the GNR, who saw that they might lose control of the local lines, and even that the LNWR would get access from Leighton over the line into GNR and ECR territory. The GNR made it clear they would demand onerous conditions for the construction of the bridge, and some shareholders opposed the merger for that reason; however the opposition was voted down and the motion to merge the companies was carried, on 26 January 1858. In fact the bridge was never built. Formation of the Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway Dunstable Church Street stationThe Amalgamation Bill obtained the Royal Assent on 28 June 1858, with combined capital of ¬£185,000; it was to be called the Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway company. Six months notice was given to the ECR to terminate the working agreement on the Hertford line. The Hertford line was already in operation, having opened to goods traffic on 28 February 1858 (a Sunday) and a passenger service on Monday 1 March 1858.Woodward, page 9 The Luton to Dunstable section was making better progress than before, and on 18 March 1858, Col Yolland of the Board of Trade visited for the inspection prior to passenger operation. He refused the approval, as there was no turntable at Leighton; there was a policy of forbidding tender engines from running tender first in main traffic. Yolland visited again a month later and this time, the Company undertook not to use tender engines and Yolland passed the line as fit for passenger operation. Opening and operation, Hatfield to Dunstable Goods train operation did not need the approval, and it had been planned to open the line to goods trains on 8 March 1858; however last-minute difficulties over a dispute with the L&NWR; over the use of Dunstable station, and the discovery of a bridge that was inadequate in strength, led to the goods opening being delayed until 5 April 1858. The passenger service started on 3 May 1858. There were five trains each way daily except Sundays, and they were worked by the LNWR as the line was only connected to their line. (The LNWR retained running powers Dunstable to Luton after the line was connected at the Welwyn end.)Woodward, page 10Carter, page 264 The LNWR Dunstable station had been built as a terminus, on the west side of Watling Street, and when the line from Luton opened, trains used it by reversing between the station and the junction west of that point. A separate station at Dunstable, named Church Street, was opened in June 1858. At the Welwyn end of the line, progress was not so good. In fact the Company ran out of time, and the time limit imposed on the earlier Act had to be extended, by Act of 21 July 1859. A demonstration run for the Directors ran on 12 June 1860, and a shareholders' special train ran on 17 July 1860. The section between Luton and Welwyn Junction opened for passenger and goods traffic on 1 September 1860, and was worked by the Great Northern Railway. The Welwyn Junction station was closed on the same day, and trains continued to Hatfield station instead. A Sunday passenger train service was operated, but from 1 June 1866 it did not run throughout to Dunstable LNWR, but terminated at Dunstable Church Street. As there was no run-round facility there, the arriving engine was run round its train by gravitating the coaches while the engine was in a siding.Woodward, page 27 The LNWR ceased running a service between Dunstable and Luton between 1866 and 1881. The Great Northern Railway ran a commercially competitive service to London from Luton via Hatfield, notwithstanding the longer route and branch line alignment for part of the way. Welwyn stations and junctions Welwyn Junction station was opened in 1858 to serve as an interchange enabling passengers using the Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway trains to join main line trains. It had two platforms and was situated to the north of the present Welwyn Garden City station. It was closed on 1 September 1860 when the Welwyn Junction to Luton section of the Dunstable branch opened. Hatfield was then made the interchange station for both branch lines. Trains from Hertford and Dunstable joined the double-track main line at Welwyn Junction and ran on the main line to Hatfield. In 1868 the branches ran through on independent tracks from Welwyn Junction to Hatfield, so that there was a single line for the Luton line on the west side of the main line, and a single line for the Hertford line on the east side.The Reverend Tom W Gladwin, Peter W Neville, and Douglas E White, Welwyn's Railways: A History of the Great Northern Line from 1850 to 1986, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1986, , pages 13 and 14 Taken over by the Great Northern Railway Hertford Cowbridge railway stationThe Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway was acquired by the Great Northern Railway by Act of 12 June 1861. The LNWR running powers from Dunstable to Luton were sustained in the Act. Wrottesley says at this point, \\"The GN later abandoned the short curves proposed at Welwyn.\\" This refers to the northward spurs for both the Hertford and Luton lines, which had never been built; the \\"abandonment\\" is of the intention to make them. Dunstable station relocated The situation at Dunstable was obviously unsatisfactory with GNR trains reversing into the LNWR station, and a new Dunstable North station was opened in January 1866. The GNR's Church Street station was inconvenient and inadequate, and it was rebuilt after a fire in 1871. In 1868 the Midland Railway opened its main line from St Pancras to Bedford, with a main station at Luton, adjacent to the GNR station there.Woodward, page 37 1895 timetable In 1895 the passenger service was recorded in Bradshaw. There were seven trains each weekday on the LNWR Dunstable branch; there were ten throughout between Dunstable and Hatfield, as well as seven (8 on Saturdays) between Luton and Dunstable. Three journeys were made each way on the Hertford branch.Bradshaw‚Äôs Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, Railmotors on the Hertford line In the first years of the twentieth century, a number of railway companies tried out railmotors, single-coach passenger units with a small integrated steam engine. These were useful on sparsely-trafficked lines, and generally had retractable steps to enable the use of cheap track-level \\"platforms\\" with minimal facilities. The GNR tried this system on the Hatfield to Hertford line in 1904. Attimore Hall Halt and Hatfield Hall Halt were opened on this basis in 1904, but the experiment was unsuccessful, and the halts and the system were discontinued in 1905. Hatfield track widening Hertingfordbury railway station in 1953Writing in 1908, Goodman described the track layout from Hatfield to Welwyn Junction; the heavy and slow mineral traffic on the main line had caused the GNR to widen the line; there were six tracks: from east to west they were: * Hertford branch line; * Up Goods Line * Up Main Line; * Down Main Line; * Down Goods Line; * Luton Branch Line.F Goodman, The Hatfield Branches of the Great Northern Railway, in the Railway Magazine, November 1908, page 393 1910 train service Bradshaw for 1910 shows the passenger service had increased considerably; there were seven trains each weekday on the Leighton to Dunstable section; the station at Stanbridgeford was open, but marked \\"sig\\" (for calls by request) for most trains; there were ten trains throughout between Dunstable and Hatfield with seven (8 on Saturdays) in addition between Luton and Dunstable. On Sundays there were two trains throughout and two more between Luton and Dunstable (Church Street). Hatfield to Hertford had secured 13 trains daily, 14 on Saturdays and two on Sundays.Bradshaw, 1910 Welwyn stations Wheathampstead railway stationIn 1917 halt platforms were erected on both the Dunstable and Hertford branches, immediately north of Hunter's Bridge. These were for the sole use of railway employees, as there was no public Welwyn station there. On 16 August 1920 the platform on the Dunstable branch, developed by the provision of timber-built station buildings, was opened to passengers with access from Hunter's Bridge, and thus became the predecessor to the present station at Welwyn Garden City. In November 1920 a footnote reference to a train in the timetable says \\"Calls at a Halt at Welwyn Garden City between Hatfield and Ayot'. There were then five down trains and three in the up direction each weekday. By August 1926, immediately prior to the opening of the present station, the 'Halt' was served by seventeen down and sixteen up trains per weekday, which indicates the growth of Welwyn Garden City. At this time a train referred to in the timetable as the 'Garden City Express' left Kings Cross at 10.55 am and after calling at Finsbury Park ran non-stop to the 'Halt' arriving at 11.30 am. The Express returned at 5.33 pm and after the Finsbury Park stop arrived at Kings Cross at 6.5 pm. Nameboards erected on the station were lettered Welwyn Garden City with no reference to its status as a Halt. Photographs of the wooden platform on the Hertford branch suggest it never carried a name board and, unlike Attimore Halt on the same branch, it was never shown in the public timetables as a stop for passenger services. It therefore seems safe to assume that it was indeed solely for the use of railway employees. It was presumably dismantled at the same time as the Luton line platform. The opening of the present station to passengers on 20 September 1926 was followed by the formal opening by the Rt Hon Neville Chamberlain on 5 October 1926. The new station included separate platform faces for Hertford and Dunstable branch trains.Gladwin et al, pages 16 to 20 Railway reorganisations After World War I the Government decided to compel the main line railways of Great Britain to join one or other of four new large companies, in a process known as the \\"grouping\\" of 1923, following the Railways Act 1921. The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway. This process was repeated in 1948 when the railways were nationalised, following the Transport Act 1947. Hertford line decline The Hatfield to Hertford line remained undeveloped throughout its lifetime. The opening of the direct line from Hertford to Enfield, creating the Hertford Loop Line, in 1924 abstracted all the London business from the line. The Hertford Cowbridge station was closed and trains used the new Hertford North station on the Hertford Loop.Gordon, pages 122 and 123 The LNER (as successor to the GNR) persevered in providing a good train service of eight or nine trains daily on the Hatfield to Hertford line right up until 1939, in the hope that residential development seen elsewhere would be repeated here. Passenger trains were however withdrawn on 18 June 1951; ordinary goods traffic continued until 1962 and a household refuse train worked to Holwell Pit until total closure of the Hertford line on 23 May 1966. Luton and Dunstable after 1948 The ex-LNWR Leighton to Dunstable branch closed on 2 July 1962.Woodward, pages 37 to 39 The passenger service on the Hatfield to Dunstable section closed on 26 April 1965. A connection was made at Luton between the Dunstable line and the Midland main line; it was commissioned on 1 January 1966, and the line between Luton and Blackbridge sidings, near Welwyn, was closed completely. On the same date the section between Dunstable North and Grovebury Sidings was closed, leaving only the stub at Welwyn to Blackbridge Dump, Luton to Dunstable Cement Sidings and Grovebury Sidings to Leighton Buzzard operational. Guided busway For some years, there was talk of reopening the part of the line between Luton and Dunstable, but funding never became available. A more attractive opportunity proved to be a guided busway. It opened on 25 September 2013.Dunstable Today (newspaper), 24 September 2003, at https://www.dunstabletoday.co.uk/news/the-91m-luton-dunstable-guided-busway- is-finally-open-1-5521822 Station list * Hertford East Junction; divergence from Eastern Counties Hertford branch; * Hertford; opened 1 March 1858; sometimes known as Cowbridge to distinguish from the ECR station; renamed Hertford North 1923; closed 2 June 1924; * Hertford North; station on Hertford Loop; opened 2 June 1924; still open; * Hertingfordbury; opened December 1858; closed 18 June 1951; * Hatfield Hyde Halt; opened May 1905; closed June 1905; * Cole Green; opened December 1858; closed 18 June 1951; * Attimore Hall Halt; opened May 1905; closed after June 1905; * Welwyn Junction; opened 1 March 1858; closed 1 September 1860.Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002 ; * Hatfield; main line station; opened 7 August 1850; still open; * Welwyn Garden City; main linne station; opened 16 August 1920; (14 August 1920 Quick) closed 20 September 1926; (15 chains) * Welwyn Garden City; new main line station; opened 20 September 1926; * Ayott St Peters; opened 2 July 1877; renamed Ayot April 1878;closed 26 September 1949; goods service continued until 1 May 1963; * Wheathampstead; opened 1 September 1860; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 26 July 1965; * Harpenden; opened 1 September 1860; renamed Harpenden East 25 September 1950; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 25 November 1963; * New Mill End; opened 1 September 1860; renamed Luton Hoo 1 December 1891 ; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 25 November 1963; * Luton; opened 3 May 1858; renamed Luton Bute Street 25 September 1950; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 26 June 1967; * Dunstable Church Street; opened 3 May 1858; renamed Dunstable Town 1 January 1927; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 7 December 1964; * Chaul End Halt; in use by munitions workers 1914 ‚Äì 1919; * Dunstable; LNWR station; opened 1 June 1848; relocated to form through station January 1866; renamed Dunstable North 25 September 1950; closed 26 April 1965; goods service continued until 9 October 1967; * Stanbridgeford; opened late 1849; opened 1860; closed 2 July 1962; * Leighton; main line station; opened 9 April 1838; renamed Leighton Buzzard 1911; still open.Woodward, page 68 Further reading An extensive explanation of the railways dealing with the straw hat trade at Luton: F Goodman, Traffic Dept, G.N.R., How the Railways Deal with Special Classes of Traffic: 1.

He was Minister of the Colonies in 1906‚Äì09. Early years Rapha√´l Milli√®s- Lacroix was born in Dax, Landes, on 4 December 1850. His parents were the painter Jean-Eug√®ne Milli√®s-Lacroix (1809‚Äì56) and Marie Jos√©phine Jouvenot, daughter of a wholesale fabric merchant. His father died while he was young. He hoped to go on to the Ecole polytechnique after completing his secondary education in Dax, but his grandfather insisted that he join the drapery business. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he was enlisted and fought in the 55th infantry regiment. After returning the Dax, at the age of 21 he took charge of the wholesale fabric business, which prospered. He married Marie Betry-Golzart. Local politics Milli√®s-Lacroix became a member of the Republican committee, then in 1877 was appointed secretary-treasurer of the Republican Committee of Resistance. He was a member of the Republican Committee of his constituency from 1877 to 1885, and secretary-general of the Republican Committee during the elections of 1885 and 1886. He was elected to the Dax municipal council in 1879, became deputy mayor in 1880 and mayor in 1887. He was a strong defender of the rights of local officials, and in 1891 had a duel with the sub-prefect of Dax over municipal franchises. In 1894 he was dismissed from his position as mayor by Charles Dupuy, the Minister of the Interior, for having authorized bullfights in defiance of prefectural directives. Milli√®s-Lacroix was reelected as mayor without difficulty. During the Dreyfus affair he supported a retrial, in opposition to the other members of the municipal council, and resigned from the council. He was elected to the general council of the Landes department in 1898, became vice-president in 1908, and was president of the departmental assembly from 1922 to 1924. He was one of the main editors of the local newspaper Le Dacquois. He installed thermal baths in Dax, and undertook public works that drastically changed the urban landscape. National politics Milli√®s-Lacroix ran successfully for election as a senator for Landes on 3 January 1897. He was reelected in 1906, 1920 and 1924. He sat with the Radical Democratic Left and Radical Socialist group. He was elected to the Senate Finance Committee in 1900, and was rapporteur of the budgets of the railways and of the Interior. Milli√®s-Lacroix was not known as a public speaker, but was an effective committee member and earned a reputation for his honesty and dedication to economy. In senate debates he was a firm defender of bullfighting. Milli√®s-Lacroix was Minister of the Colonies from 25 October 1906 to 24 July 1909 in the cabinet of Georges Clemenceau.

The Church was built by the British government at the request of the army officers in the area in 1830. The church was constructed with bomb-proof roof and rust-proof iron railings, and most of the materials for the construction were imported from Britain. It is located in the foothills of St. Thomas Mount and named after St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles who resided at the place during his final years. St. Thomas English Garrison Church is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services and follows the Protestant Christian tradition. In modern times, it is under the dominion of Diocese of Madras of the Church of South India. The Church is declared as a heritage monument under the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. Architecture Sanctum of the shrine The church is considered an exact replica of St Clement Danes at London. St. Thomas Garrison Church was modelled on contemporary churches like St. George's Cathedral, Chennai. It is located in the foothills of St. Thomas Mount and is named after St. Thomas, one of the Twelve apostles who resided at the place during his final years. It is long and wide. The compound was built with bricks, mortar and limestone. It is believed that the railings are made out of iron from the discarded weapons of Tipu Sultan. The Church was originally the starting point to Southern districts, located in 1, Grand South Trunk Road from Chennai. The building had a bomb-proof roof, rust-proof iron railings and cast iron chairs imported from England. The altar houses conventional Methodist images and a prayer hall for the worshippers. Paintings of Jesus Christ and other apostles are housed on the walls facing the worshippers. The room behind the sanctuary has a wooden staircase leading to the top of the tower. The original temple bell cast in England was heavy and developed cracks. It was replaced by a smaller bell from Rangoon donated by a church member. There are twenty windows, five doors, Roman ionic pillars, a false ceiling made of teak wood, imported chairs, Bible and a pipe organ. The British Army and administrative officers residing in the Garrison and regions around it made generous contributions to the church. The monument of Major- General William Sydenham is found in the precincts of the Church. The Church originally had a multi level tall spire, which was trimmed to accommodate passing flights from the nearby airport. History St. Thomas Mount, the donwhill where the Church is located The British troops were housed in various places in Pallavaram and St. Thomas Mount. There was agitation by the soldiers to build a church for their worship. The government asked the Military Board to provide an estimate and allowed it to rent a building temporarily for the worship. Rev. Atwood, who was frontrunning the proposal, submitted a proposal for 3,000 pounds sterling. The proposal was rejected citing cost. After Atwood, who died in 1810, his successor Rev. Bell suggested expanding the rented building. There were multiple proposals for building the church, but the final approval came in 1820. But there were further roadblocks with the East India Company citing clashes over the allotted land. Later it was suggested that the church should be common for Pallavaram and St. Thomas Mount as a 600 seater. The proposal was accepted by the directors and the building was constructed at an estimated cost of 43,773. The building was completed in 1827, but was opened only in 1830 by Bishop Turner who had to travel from Calcutta. The Church is declared as a heritage monument under the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. Worship services Today, the Church is administered by the Diocese of Madras of the Church of South India. Services are held in the church from Monday to Friday at 8 a.m.; 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturdays; and 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays. The church's festival is celebrated at Christmas time for eight days, starting with flag hoisting on 24 December and ending with a feast and religious lectures on 2 January.

The tale is thought to have originated in the mid-13th century, however its earliest known record is on vellum fragments dated to the 15th century. The vast majority of the modern translation comes from 17th century paper fragments. The √æ√°ttr is often examined as it is considered to have strong artistic merit, exemplify saga characteristics, and to be of an appropriate length to examine in its entirety.  Plot synopsis  Thorarinn is a poor, cantankerous retired Viking with bad vision. Despite his poverty, is he is a bondi who breeds horses. His son, Thorstein, is said to be a good, even-tempered man who does the work of three. He becomes involved in a horse-fight with Thord, a horse-breeder for Bjarni Brodd-Helgason. When it becomes apparent Thord‚Äôs horse is losing, Thord strikes Thorstein‚Äôs horse. Thorstein then strikes Thord‚Äôs horse; Thord in turn strikes Thorstein. Thorstein dismisses the strike as an accident to avoid conflict. Two of Bjarni‚Äôs farmhands, Thorvall and Thorhall, create the insulting nickname of Staff-Struck for Thorstein. Months later, Thorstein is accused, by his father, of being a ragr for running away from a conflict and for not demanding compensation. Thorstein later confronts and kills Thord after he refused to state whether the act was an accident or not. Thorstein proclaims the killing to a woman, who tells Bjarni, at dinner, after Thorstein has escaped. Bjarni as gothi outlaws Thorstein for the slaying, but does not actively hunt Thorstein to kill or remove him from the land. When insulted by Thorvall and Thorhall, for failing to adequately avenge his thingmen, Bjarni commands that they chase down and kill Thorstein. They die in combat with Thorstein, and their bodies are returned to Bjarni‚Äôs farm tied to their horses. Rannveig, Bjarni‚Äôs wife, convinces him to kill Thorstein, fearing that the unavenged death of three thingmen by an outlaw would inexorably damage their honor. Against her wishes that he go forth accompanied by an entourage, he sets out to fight Thorstein alone. Thorstein and Bjarni enter into a duel. Bjarni becomes thirsty and asks Thorstein to pause so he can have a drink of water. Thorstein obliges. Bjarni‚Äôs shoe becomes untied and asks Thorstein to pause. Thorstein obliges. Bjarni‚Äôs sword soon becomes dull. After an exchange of insults and threats, Thorstein offers to exchange the blade for one of his father's. When it becomes apparent that Thorstein has been holding back, Bjarni offers Thorstein the opportunity to end the fight if he takes the place of the three men he had slain by becoming Bjarni's farmhand. Thorstein accepts. Bjarni then tells Thorarinn that he has slain Thorstein and offers to support him in his son‚Äôs absence. Thorarinn delivers a speech in which he insults gothis who take up support for the dependents of the people that they kill, claiming that it is a hollow act done purely for personal satisfaction as opposed to true repentance. He then attempts to attack Bjarni. Bjarni defends against the attack and tells Thorarinn how Thorstein and he came to terms. Bjarni, Thorstein, Thorarinn then move to Hof and live successful lives.  Interpretations and implications  = An aggressive culture = The saga has been interpreted as a critic of the aggressive nature of medieval Icelandic culture. Under the cultural system, an individual is expected to avenge all transgressions or be seen as dishonorable and cowardly. Thorstein becomes embroiled in a cycle of purposeless violence, when his own father is brought to calling him ragr, for trying to avoid it. The climactic fight between Bjarni and Thorstein can be seen as cultural display. Both men are forced to blows to put up a display of violence, so they can be seen as assertive, despite neither of them actually wishing to do true harm. The heroes are caught between respect and ire for rigid, heroic code that demands vengeance despite the absurdity of the situation. This tale has been used to examine the strong dichotomy between the practical and ceremonial views of violence in medieval Icelandic society. = Nicknames = The Nordic practice of nicknaming is of key importance to this tale. Thorstein receives the nickname Staff-Struck. A play on the Nordic practice of shame-stroke, this nickname is not only practically descriptive of the events at horse-fight but has strong sexual implications. The act of creating an insulting nickname was a serious crime, carrying a penalty of lesser outlawry for three years. The passive acceptance of this name combined with Thorstein's initial refusal to pursue legal action against Thord causes a cowardly stigma, acknowledged even by his own father. = Gendered insults = The tale displays the highly gendered nature of Nordic insulting. The references to ragr and shame-stroke mentioned above are found with additional insults. Thorarinn insulted Thorstein by claiming he was working too early in the morning. This is representative of the gendered work schedule in Iceland where women wake up and begin their day's work before the men. When proclaiming Thorstein's killing, a requirement to reduce a homicide to manslaughter, he claimed that a bull had gored Thord. This has been interpreted as a sexualized metaphor. = Saga style = Thorstein Staff-Struck was analyzed by Theodore Andersson as a perfect example of his six part saga style, consisting of an introduction, conflict, climax, revenge, and reconciliation. Some scholars debate this structuralist model. = Tense patterns = Peter Richardsons suggested that the tense patterns of Thorstein Staff-Struck are representative of larger tense patterns in the saga style and are used to build or relieve tension. = Portrayal of the elderly = √Årmann Jakobsson has used the tale of Thorstein Staff-Struck to argue how the sagas portray old men as old women, in part by the examination of the actions taken by Thorarinn.

The injury symbolically represents the anal rape of a man. As such, the injury is designed not only to be debilitating but also sexually humiliating through the symbolic feminization of the victim (usually a vanquished enemy), by turning him into an ergi. The injury was considered a mortal wound, as such was ranked with brain injury, a marrow injury, and other fatal wounds. It was considered symbolic of the loss of power in the Norse society where power and status were important as well as an outward signifier of the physical and social power that the dominator wielded over the dominated. The term is Nordic in origin, and equated with castration as \\"unmanning\\" the victim, and classed with wounds that cause major penetrations of the body, strongly suggesting that the term refers to rape or forced anal sex. It was considered a legal term, with the shame entailed associated with the shame of ragr. The \\"unmanning\\" also often came with an insulting cognomen indicating status degradation and once the name stuck, ensured that the shame would not be forgotten.

The initial business idea was to build customized electronics equipment. Over the years, NDC evolved into a technology platform provider (navigation, hardware, software) for AGV (automated guided vehicle) builders. Danaher acquired NDC in 2001.  History  = The first years = NDC began producing specially built electronics equipment on a small scale for a variety of industries, for example, manufacturing and marine. The number of owners grew in the 1960s to include Ingvar Bergstr√∂m, Arne Nilsson and Jan Jutander. At the beginning of the 1970s, NDC had some 30 employees and started to attract big companies such as Getinge, Tetra Pak and Volvo. The first AGV project was for the Volvo Kalmar Assembly plant in 1972. NDC was involved in producing the AGV prototypes but was considered too small to take on the total project. They were, however, commissioned to deliver all the drives. At that time, the Volvo plant was a revolution in the automotive industry, introducing a totally new way of working. = New business model = In 1976, Tetra Pak installed twenty AGVs in their plant in Lund, Sweden. NDC provided the electronics, Tellus the mechanics and ErgoData the control system. The project was a success, and Tetra Pak began to introduce AGVs in their plants worldwide. NDC was involved in many AGV projects for Tetra Pak during the 1970s and 1980s, and saw its chance to expand the business into something more. In the early 1980s, NDC made the strategically important decision to focus on creating a generic controls platform for AGV builders. Driven by the development of computer technology, it was now possible for NDC to offer the flexibility that AGV builders needed to create customized driverless vehicles. The new NDC business model was born: ‚ÄúGeneric technology to be applied by others.‚Äù The first partner was the French company Lamson Saunier Duval, and the number of partners quickly grew into two digits. NDC spent a lot of time educating partners on all the possibilities of generic technology. The new business model paved the way for international expansion with NDC subsidiaries in Italy, the Czech Republic and the United States. The American NDC subsidiary, NDC Automation Inc., had its own subsidiary in Australia. NDC Automation Inc. went public on March 28, 1990, and subsequently changed its name to Transbotics in 2001. = The laser revolution = Laser technology took off in many industrial applications in the 1980s, and NDC started to explore the potential. In 1991, NDC introduced laser technology as AGV navigation for a Tetra Pak factory in Singapore. Tetra Pak appreciated the ease-of-change to new working patterns with laser navigation and began a worldwide plant upgrade to laser navigation. NDC named their navigation technology Lazerway. In the 1990s, AGVs increased in complexity. By focusing on being a technology platform provider (navigation, hardware, software), NDC could stay strong in an AGV industry that had split into new categories such as mobile robots. = NDC today = After the Danaher acquisition in 2001, NDC was named Danaher Motion and later on transformed into the Kollmorgen brand. The NDC brand name was kept but is now the name of the technology platform: NDC Solutions. As of July 2016, Kollmorgen is part of Fortive Corporation.

Today, the document is preserved at the National Library of Malta in Valletta, Malta. Background The origins of the Knights Hospitaller go back to around 1048, when the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mustansir Billah gave permission to merchants from the Republic of Amalfi to build a hospital in Jerusalem. The community which ran the hospital became independent during the First Crusade in around 1099, under the leadership of Grand Master Blessed Gerard. The bull The bull is preserved at the National Library of Malta in Valletta Pope Paschal II granted the bull to the Blessed Gerard on 15 February 1113. In it, the Pope formally recognized the foundation of the Hospital, which became a lay-religious order under the sole protection of the Church. The bull gave the Order the right to elect its Grand Masters without interference from external authorities. The knights of the Order were bound by three vows: poverty, chastity and obedience. The bull formed the legal basis of the independence and sovereignty of the Order. The document is preserved at the National Library of Malta in Valletta, Malta. Commemorations The 900th anniversary of the papal bull was commemorated by the SMOM with a two-day International Conference in Rome, which was attended by around 5000 people. The conference began on 7 February 2013, and it ended on 9 February with a mass held by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone at St. Peter's Basilica. The branches of the SMOM around the world also commemorated the anniversary with a number of initiatives.

Club career Reid Burke was playing for Raheny United when the Women's National League (WNL) was formed in 2011 and represented the club in the competition's first season. Over the next three seasons, she won two league titles and three consecutive FAI Women's Cups with \\"The Pandas.\\" She also represented the club in the UEFA Women's Champions League. For the 2015‚Äì16 season, Reid Burke remained with the club in their new guise as Shelbourne Ladies. She switched to Dublin rivals Peamount United ahead of the 2018 Women's National League season. International career Reid Burke was Ireland's first-choice goalkeeper at under 17 level. She then progressed to the under 19 team, initially as understudy to Lynn Bradley. At the 2014 Cyprus Cup she won her first senior cap in a 1‚Äì1 draw with South Korea. She made her next appearance and the first start against Austria at the 2015 Istria Cup, a 2‚Äì0 defeat. She also featured in the next game against Costa Rica, as Ireland won 2‚Äì1 and limped to a ninth-place finish at the tournament. Early in the second half, established goalkeeper Emma Byrne was injured in the act of conceding a penalty kick, which substitute Reid Burke saved. In May 2015, Reid Burke was pressed into action again for a daunting friendly away to world champions the United States. After the match was arranged it came to light that it was outside FIFA's designated dates for international matches, so Byrne's English club Arsenal would not release her. Reid Burke acquitted herself well in Ireland's 3‚Äì0 defeat, but conceded a bizarre first-half goal when she ignored the ball to comfort injured teammate M√©abh De B√∫rca.

The building, which was originally a hydropathic establishment but is now the headquarters of Derbyshire County Council, is a Grade II listed building. History John and Caroline Smedley in their book on hydropathy. Credit: Wellcome Library While on honeymoon in Switzerland in 1847, John Smedley had become seriously ill. On returning to England, he recuperated at the hydropathic establishment at Ben Rhydding in Yorkshire and later took the waters at Cheltenham. From then on, hydropathy was the greatest interest in Smedley's life.Derby Evening Telegraph; \\"There Was Red Tape at Smedley's Hydro Then\\", 3 January 1951 Matlock had developed as a spa town after thermal springs were discovered and the building on Matlock Bank was originally established as a small private hospital in 1851. It was acquired by John Smedley, the hospital's medical adviser, in 1853. The earliest (western) section of the building seen today was built by Smedley in . The design involved a main frontage of eleven bays with sash windows. Much of today's building was added after Smedley's death in 1874. The first phase, in 1881, included the entrance hall and staircase, now in the middle section: a large stained glass window, depicting the goddess Hygieia on the left, Truth in the middle and the god Asclepius on the right, was designed and installed on the staircase by Shrigley and Hunt in 1882. In 1886, the eastern section, including the tower with its square mansard roof, was added by architect George Statham of Nottingham. Later extensions include the tall chimney, impressive for its height on the already prominent site, along with boiler house and bath in 1894. The domed glass Winter Gardens, which housed a ballroom, and the northern block on the other side of Smedley Street were added in 1901. The northern block was linked by the unusual two storey bridge over Smedley Street. The facility soon became the largest hydropathic hotel in the town: > John Smedley was not the first to recognise and exploit the effects of water > treatment on various illnesses, but it was Smedley whose conviction and > enterprise established Hydrotherapy firmly in Matlock, and for a century > made it one of the most celebrated centres of the \\"water cure\\".

Early life Pathmanabha was born on 19 November 1951. He was from Kankesanthurai in northern Ceylon. Pathmanabha became interested in radical politics in the late 1960s. He was one of the members of the Tamil Student Federation/Tamil Students' League which was formed in 1972 as a reaction to the discriminatory Policy of standardisation. The 1974 Tamil conference incident further radicalised Pathmanabha. ELO In 1974/75 Pathmanabha and others founded the Eelam Liberation Organisation (Eela Viduthalai Iyakkam) (ELO). On 10 May 1976 the ELO robbed the Puloly Multi-purpose Cooperative Society's bank in Puloly. Pathmanabha was personally involved in the robbery. Others involved in the robbery included Varatharaja Perumal (later Chief Minister of North Eastern Province), V. Balakumaran (later leader of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students) and S. Thavaraja (later an Eelam People's Democratic Party MP and leader of the opposition on the Northern Provincial Council). After the robbery Pathmanabha went on the run whilst the ELO disintegrated due to the security crackdown. GUES/EROS Pathmanabha moved to London in 1976 to study accountancy. Here he met with other Tamils who shared his views. Together they formed the General Union of Eelam Students (GUES) and the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS). Said Hammami, the Palestine Liberation Organization's representative in London, helped a small group Tamils including Pathmanabha take military training in the Lebanon. In 1978 he went to India to establish a base for GUES/EROS. He then returned to Sri Lanka but the security forces were still looking for him so he had to travel in disguise. EPRLF Pathmanabha and other members, including Douglas Devananda, Varatharaja Perumal and Suresh Premachandran, left the EROS in 1981 and formed their own militant group which would come to be known as the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). Pathmanabha moved to Kodambakam, Madras, India in 1981 to establish the new group. In December 1986 the rival Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) attacked the EPRLF in Sri Lanka, inflicting a heavy losses and killing Gaffoor, the EPRLF's military commander. Many EPRLF cadres were killed or taken prisoner and EPRLF camps and weapons were seized by the LTTE. Devananda was blamed for the debacle. The LTTE's animosity against the EPRLF, which it considered to be pro-India, increased following the outbreak of fighting between the LTTE and the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in October 1987. The LTTE called for a boycott of the 1998 North Eastern Provincial Council election, stating that anyone who contested would be labelled a traitor and punished. The EPRLF nevertheless contested and, with the connivance of the IPKF, secured 41 of the 71 seats on the North Eastern Provincial Council. Varatharaja Perumal became the first (and only) Chief Minister of North Eastern Province. On 1 March 1990, just as the IPKF were preparing to withdraw from Sri Lanka, Perumal moved a motion in the North Eastern Provincial Council declaring an independent Eelam. Fearful of the consequences once the IPKF had pulled out, the EPRLF leadership fled to India. On 11 March 1990 Pathmanabha was flown from Trincomalee to Bhubaneswar in an Indian military aircraft. President Ranasinghe Premadasa imposed direct rule on the North Eastern province on 25 March 1990. On the evening of 19 June 1990 the EPRLF central committee were meeting at a flat at the Zachria Colony in Kodambakam. At around 7pm gunmen broke into the flat and started firing. Eight people including Pathmanabha, Member of Parliament G. Yogasangari and provincial minister P. Kirubakaran were killed. Five EPRLF cadres waiting outside the block of flats were also killed. The assassination was blamed on the rival rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

It identifies key threats to the UK and the capabilities required to address them.  Threats  The National Security Risk Assessment 2015 found the threats faced by the UK, including its Overseas Territories and overseas interests, have \\"increased in scale, diversity and complexity\\" since 2010. It highlighted four particular threats that are likely to be priorities for UK security in the coming decade: # The increasing threat posed by terrorism, extremism and instability. # The resurgence of state-based threats; and intensifying wider state competition. # The impact of technology, especially cyber threats; and wider technological developments. # The erosion of the rules-based international order, making it harder to build consensus and tackle global threats. Decisions The commitments in the paper for equipment and support for the three services amounted to ¬£178 billion up to 2025. This is roughly 20% of the 10 year budget period. The government reaffirmed its commitment to spending 2% of national GDP on defence. =Joint Forces= *The largest deployable expeditionary force to be increased from 30,000 to 50,000 by 2025. This includes a maritime task group headed by an aircraft carrier, a land division consisting of three brigades, an air group of combat, surveillance and transport aircraft, and a Special Forces task group. *Planned investment in Special Forces equipment doubled and advanced communications equipment and weapons will be purchased. *British Defence Staffs headquarters will be established in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa in 2016. *¬£1.9 billion investment in cyber capabilities and development of satellite communications and space-based surveillance capabilities. *The Ministry of Defence would purchase at least 2 Airbus Zephyr high-altitude UAVs. *The number of nuclear warheads will be reduced to no more than 180 by the mid-2020s. =Royal Navy= Both Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers will now enter service. *Personnel will be increased by 400. *Both Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers will be brought into service and fully crewed, one of which will be modified to better support amphibious operations and one carrier to be available at all times. *The Royal Navy will continue to maintain 19 frigates and destroyers, but with the long-term goal of ultimately increasing the fleet. *Procurement of the Type 26 frigate reduced from 13 to 8.David Cameron in the House of Commons, Guardian.com, November 2015 A new class of \\"at least five\\" lighter, flexible, general purpose frigates will be designed and built to ensure the Royal Navy has \\"at least\\" 13 frigates in service. These will be more affordable than the Type 26s in order to allow the Royal Navy to buy more of them and further expand its fleet of frigates and destroyers by the 2030s. This second variant will be known as the Type 31 frigate. *A new class of ballistic missile submarines, now known as the Dreadnought class, will be built to replace all four Vanguard-class submarines, the first of which will enter service in the early 2030s. Ballistic missile submarines will carry no more than 40 warheads across only eight operational Trident D5 missiles *A further two River-class patrol vessels were to be ordered for a fleet of \\"up to 6\\" by 2025. The three Batch 2 River-Class ships will replace the earlier 3 Batch 1 River-Class ships. Later, during a Defence Select Committee in July 2016, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Andrew Jones indicated that the option for a fleet of 'up to six' offshore patrol vessels had been reduced to five, with Clyde being replaced by one of the new Batch 2 ships. The First Sea Lord also elaborated on the potential uses for the Batch 2 ships overseas, including the possibility of forward basing an extra ship at the Falklands Islands, or forward basing it elsewhere. Subsequently, post-Brexit, it was decided to retain three Batch I vessels to operate in UK waters. *Four Tide-class tankers were to continue to be built as originally planned, along with three Solid Support Ship. *Both Albion-class landing platform docks and all three Bay- class landing ship docks will remain in service. The previously planned decommissioning of HMS Ocean was confirmed. *12 mine countermeasures vessels will exist in Joint Force 2025. The three oldest Sandown-class minehunters will be decommissioned. *The manning levels for the Gibraltar Squadron will increase. *The role of Type 45 destroyers in ballistic missile defence will be further investigated. *A parliamentary reply noted that \\"The consideration of options to deliver the capabilities provided by RFA Diligence and RFA Argus remains ongoing\\" although this policy was vague and, as of 2020, had not been acted upon. =Royal Air Force= Commitment to order 9 P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft was made in the paper. *Personnel will be increased by 300. *Two additional Eurofighter Typhoon squadrons will be formed by postponing plans to retire Tranche 1 Typhoons. This will bring the total number of frontline Typhoon squadrons to seven by 2025. The Typhoon aircraft will also receive upgrades to ensure they can be retained for an additional ten years (until 2040). *There was a reaffirmed commitment to ordering 138 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs, with a total of 24 available to be deployed on board the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers by 2023. * The paper announced that the third Tornado GR4 Squadron (12 Squadron) would continue until 2018 while the remaining two squadrons, 9 and 31 Squadrons would have an out of service date of 2019. *Nine Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft will be ordered to plug the gap left by the retirement of the Nimrod in 2011 and the scrapping of its planned successor, the Nimrod MRA4. The aircraft will be based at RAF Lossiemouth. *The RPAS fleet will be doubled with the current 10 General Atomics MQ-9 Reapers to be replaced by more than 20 new armed Protector Drones (program formerly known as Scavenger). *14 C-130J Hercules aircraft will remain in service alongside 22 Airbus A400M Atlas and 8 Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. *14 Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft will be in service by 2025, with one fitted for transport of the Prime Minister, senior cabinet officials and the Royal Family. *Continued investment will be made in the development of new precision weapons. *Around four Sentinel R1 will be extended in service \\"into the next decade\\", but will leave service by 2025. *Shadow R1 will remain in service until \\"at least\\" 2030 and two more aircraft will be procured. *Sentry AEW1 and Rivet Joint R1 will remain in service until 2035. =British Army= The Ajax armoured vehicle, of which 589 are to be ordered. *The size of the Army will not fall below 82,000 regulars and 35,000 reservists. *Increased investment will be put into training and equipment for the reserves. *589 Ajax armoured vehicles will be ordered. *Two rapid-reaction \\"Strike Brigades\\" will be formed by 2025, comprising 5,000 personnel each, equipped with Ajax and the Mechanised Infantry Vehicle. The Armoured Infantry Brigades will be reduced from three to two. *Two innovative brigades will be established, comprising a mix of Regulars and specialist capabilities from the Reserves, that are able to contribute to strategic communications, tackle hybrid warfare and deliver better battlefield intelligence. *Apache attack helicopters will be upgraded.

Foreign policy The government outlined a range of foreign policy initiatives. These included: *A permanent UK military presence will be maintained in the Persian Gulf, including a new naval base in Bahrain, named HMS Juffair, and the establishment of a new British Defence Staff in the Middle East, as well as in the Asia Pacific and Africa. *There will be a doubling of the number of military personnel contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations. *The UK will work with the rule-based international order and help strengthen multilateral institutions. *UK Official Development Assistance expenditure will be maintained at 0.7% of GNI, with 50% of the DFID's spending going towards fragile states. Reaction *Malcolm Chambers of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) welcomed the 2015 NSS and SDSR, stating that \\"The outcome of this SDSR is much better than the armed forces had been expecting only six months ago, when further steep capability cuts ‚Äì comparable to those suffered over the last five years - were widely anticipated.\\" *Former Chief of the General Staff Lord Dannatt welcomed the SDSR, stating that it was an attempt to rectify past errors made in the 2010 SDSR. *The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) responded to the SDSR by saying it \\"offers a credible plan to improve, modernise and increase UK security and hard power. It maintains the UK as a significant defence power, and adds and protects future capabilities, including in areas that are needed to deal with modern threats such as terrorism and cyber attack.\\" *A report in Defense Aerospace argued that the review actually showed that \\"New cash is in short supply [and the] new capabilities [are] undefined, uncosted, unscheduled. *James de Waal of Chatham House argued that the review was more of a \\"political success\\" for the Conservative-led government, but \\"the way it came together speaks to larger problems with British policy-making on security.\\" *The Economist judged that Britain had reasserted itself as a \\"serious military power\\". *Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani said the review reaffirmed the UK's commitment to its \\"presence as a global power\\" and \\"The SDSR highlighted Japan as the closest security partner in Asia, and I highly regard this statement.\\" *In a policy paper for History & Policy, Edward Longinotti argues that Britain's strategic defence review comes at a time when the country's defence policy faces the same challenges as those encountered in 1968: how to accommodate two major commitments, to Europe and to an ‚Äòeast of Suez‚Äô global military strategy, within a modest defence budget that can only fund one. *Prime Minister David Cameron claimed U.S. President Barack Obama was \\"clearly delighted\\" with the results of the UK's defence review, with US officials reported to have been concerned at the weakening of UK defence capability caused by previous cuts.

The term \\"deterministic global optimization\\" typically refers to complete or rigorous (see below) optimization methods. Rigorous methods converge to the global optimum in finite time. Deterministic global optimization methods are typically used when locating the global solution is a necessity (i.e. when the only naturally occurring state described by a mathematical model is the global minimum of an optimization problem), when it is extremely difficult to find a feasible solution, or simply when the user desires to locate the best possible solution to a problem.  Overview  NeumaierComplete Search in Continuous Global Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction, Acta Numerica 2004 (A. Iserles, ed.), Cambridge University Press 2004 classified global optimization methods in four categories, depending on their degree of rigour with which they approach the optimum, as follows: * An incomplete method uses clever intuitive heuristics for searching but has no safeguards if the search gets stuck in a local minimum * An asymptotically complete method reaches a global minimum with certainty or at least with probability one if allowed to run indefinitely long, but has no means to know when a global minimizer has been found. * A complete method reaches a global minimum with certainty, assuming exact computations and indefinitely long run time, and knows after a finite time that an approximate global minimizer has been found (to within prescribed tolerances). * A rigorous method reaches a global minimum with certainty and within given tolerances even in the presence of rounding errors, except in near-degenerate cases, where the tolerances may be exceeded. Deterministic global optimization methods typically belong to the last two categories. Note that building a rigorous piece of software is extremely difficult as the process requires that all the dependencies are also coded rigorously. Deterministic global optimization methods require ways to rigorously bound function values over regions of space. One could say that a main difference between deterministic and non-deterministic methods in this context is that the former perform calculations over regions of the solution space, whereas the latter perform calculations on single points. This is either done by exploiting particular functional forms (e.g. McCormick relaxationsComputability of global solutions to factorable nonconvex programs: Part I ‚Äì Convex underestimating problems, Mathematical Programming, 1976, 1(10), 147‚Äì175), or using interval analysis in order to work with more general functional forms. In any case bounding is required, which is why deterministic global optimization methods cannot give a rigorous result when working with black-box code, unless that code is explicitly written to also return function bounds. For this reason, it is common for problems in deterministic global optimization to be represented using a computational graph, as it is straightforward to overload all operators such that the resulting function values or derivatives yield interval (rather than scalar) results.  Classes of deterministic global optimization problems  = Linear programming problems (LP) = Linear programming problems are a highly desirable formulation for any practical problem. The reason is that, with the rise of interior-point algorithms, it is possible to efficiently solve very large problems (involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of variables) to global optimality. Linear programming optimization problems strictly fall under the category of deterministic global optimization. = Mixed-integer linear programming problems (MILP) = Much like linear programming problems, MILPs are very important when solving decision-making models. Efficient algorithms for solving complex problems of this type are known and are available in the form of solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. = Non-linear programming problems (NLP) = Non-linear programming problems are extremely challenging in deterministic global optimization. The order of magnitude that a modern solver can be expected to handle in reasonable time is roughly 100 to a few hundreds of non-linear variables. At the time of this writing, there exist no parallel solvers for the deterministic solution of NLPs, which accounts for the complexity gap between deterministic LP and NLP programming. = Mixed-integer non-linear programming problems (MINLP) = Even more challenging than their NLP counterparts, deterministically solving an MINLP problem can be very difficult. Techniques such as integer cuts, or branching a problem on its integer variables (hence creating NLP sub-problems which can in turn be solved deterministically), are commonly used.  Zero-order methods  Zero-order methods consist of methods which make use of zero-order interval arithmetic.Hansen, E.R. Global optimization using interval analysis, Marcel Dekker Inc, New York 1992 A representative example is interval bisection.  First-order methods  First-order methods consist of methods which make use of first-order information, e.g., interval gradients or interval slopes.  Second-order methods  Second-order methods make use of second-order information, usually eigenvalue bounds derived from interval Hessian matrices. One of the most general second-order methodologies for handling problems of general type is the Œ±ŒíŒí algorithm.

The underlying physics is shared by other conventional interferometric methods such as phase contrast or differential interference contrast, or reflection interference microscopy. The key feature of iSCAT is the detection of elastic scattering from subwavelength particles, also known as Rayleigh scattering, in addition to reflected or transmission signals from supra-wavelength objects. Typically, the challenge is the detection of tiny signals on top of large and complex, speckle-like backgrounds. iSCAT has been used to investigate nanoparticles such as viruses, proteins, lipid vesicles, DNA, exosomes, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots, charge carriers and single organic molecules without the need for a fluorescent label. Historical background The principle of interference plays a central role in many imaging methods, including bright- field imaging because it can be described as the interference between the illumination field and the one that has interacted with the object, i.e. through extinction. In fact, even microscopy based on the interference with an external light field is more than one hundred years old. The first iSCAT-type of measurements were performed in the biophysics community in the 1990s. A systematic development of the method for the detection of nano-objects started in the early 2000s as a general effort to explore fluorescence-free options for studying single molecules and nano-objects. In particular, gold nanoparticles down to a size of 5 nm were imaged via the interference of their scattered light with a reflected beam from the cover-slip supporting them. Using a supercontinuum laser additionally allowed for recording the particles‚Äô plasmon spectra. The early measurements were limited by residual speckle-like background. A new approach to background subtraction and the acronym iSCAT were introduced in 2009. Since then, a series of important works has been reported by various groups. Notably, further innovations in background and noise suppression have led to the development of new quantification methods such as mass photometry (originally introduced as iSCAMS), in which ultrasensitive and accurate interferometric detection is converted into a quantitative means for measuring the molecular mass of single biomolecules.  Theoretical background  When a reference light is superposed with an object‚Äôs scattered light, the intensity at the detector can be described by, I_{det} \\\\propto |\\\\overline{E_r} + \\\\overline{E_s}|^2 = I_r + I_s + 2 E_r E_s \\\\cos \\\\phi where \\\\overline{E_r} = E_r e^{i \\\\phi_r} and \\\\overline{E_s} = E_s e^{i \\\\phi_s} are the complex electric fields of the reference and scattered light. The resulting terms are the intensity of the reference beam (I_r = |\\\\overline{E_r}|^2), the pure scattered light from the object (I_s = |\\\\overline{E_s}|^2), and the cross-term (2 E_r E_s \\\\cos \\\\phi) which contains a phase \\\\phi = \\\\phi_r - \\\\phi_s. This phase comprises a Gouy phase component from the variations of the wave vectors, a scattering phase component from the material properties of the object, and a sinusoidally modulating phase component which depends on the position of the particle. In general, the reference beam can take a different path than the scattered light within the optical setup, as long as they are coherent and interfere on the detector. However, the technique becomes simpler and more stable if both beams share the same optical path. Therefore, the reflected light off the cover-slip or the transmitted beam through the sample is typically used as the reference. For the interference to occur, it is necessary that both light waves (scattered light and reference light) are coherent. Interestingly, a light source with a large coherence length on the order of meters or more (like in modern narrow- band laser systems) is typically not needed. In the most common iSCAT realization schemes where the reflected light of a cover-slip is used as a reference and the scattering particle is not more than a few hundreds of nanometers above the glass, even ‚Äúincoherent‚Äù light, e.g. from LED‚Äôs, can be used.  Applications  iSCAT has been used in a large variety of applications. These can be grouped roughly as: = Label-free imaging = * Microtubules * Lipid nano/microdomains * Single virus assembly * Time- dependent iSCAT (StroboSCAT) = Single particle tracking = * Single virus tracking in vitro * Single virus tracking during early-stage infection in cells * Microsecond single particle tracking on a living cell membrane * Motor protein tracking = Label-free single molecule detection, imaging, tracking and quantification = * Single molecule detection by absorption * Single protein sensing * Single protein tracking * Mass photometry  References  Microscopy ","title":"Interferometric scattering microscopy"},{"id":"48622169","text":"Alessandro Venezia (born 17 August 1989) is an Italian professional footballer plays as a midfielder.

Between 1932 and 1934 he was Minister of Labor, Minister of the Colonies (twice) and Minister of Justice in four of the short-lived cabinets of that period. He was forced to resign during the scandal of the Stavisky Affair in January 1934, since his advice as Minister of Labor may have made the embezzlement possible. Early years Albert Fran√ßois Marie Dalimier was born on 20 February 1875 in Bordeaux, Gironde. He attended secondary schools in Marseille and Vanves, then attended the Lyc√©e Buffon in Paris, where his father was headmaster. He qualified as a lawyer in 1896 and became secretary to L√©on Mougeot, who served in various cabinets between 1898 and 1905. As an attorney he accepted both civil and criminal cases, and soon became well known. He was elected to the general council of Seine-et-Oise, and held this position for the rest of his career. National politics In 1906 Dalimier ran successfully for election to the legislature for the first constituency of Corbeil in Seine-et-Oise, and was reelected in 1910 and 1914. He sat with the Radical Republicans and Radical Socialists. On 14 June 1914 he joined the cabinet of Ren√© Viviani as under-secretary of state for Fine Arts, and retained this position in subsequent cabinets until 16 November 1917. He did not stand in the 1919 elections, but returned to his legal career. He won the election of May 1924 in the second round, and was reelected in 1928 and 1932. Dalimier was in favor of disarmament, the League of Nations and the progressive income tax. He spoke well, but introduced only three bills during twenty one years in the legislature. Dalimier was Minister of Labor from 3 June 1932 to 31 January 1933 in the cabinet of √âdouard Herriot and the succeeding cabinet of Joseph Paul-Boncour. On 6 September 1933 Dalimier succeeded Albert Sarraut as Minister of the Colonies in the cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. When that cabinet fell, he became Minister of Justice and vice president of the council on 26 October 1933 in the cabinet of Albert Sarraut. The Sarraut cabinet fell after a month, and on 26 November 1933 he was again made Minister of the Colonies in the cabinet of Camille Chautemps. Stavisky scandal While Minister of Labor, in June 1932 Dalimier was asked by the Radical deputy Joseph Garat, president of the Bayonne cr√©dit municipal, to remind private insurance companies that they could invest in cr√©dit municipal bonds. The municipal caisses de cr√©dit acted as pawn shops and provided other banking services. On 25 June 1932 Dalimier wrote to the president of the General Board of Insurance Companies that reminded him what good value the bonds provided, and saying investment in these bonds was a matter of public interest. The Ministry of Labor approved the operations of social insurance funds, which took contributions from workers and employers to insure against accidents and loss of work and to provide pensions. The state deposit bank was also involved in regulating the funds. At the request of the financier Alexandre Stavisky, in September 1932 Albert Dubarry, editor of the Radical daily paper La Volont√©, asked Dalimier to let social insurance funds also invest in the bonds of cr√©dits municipaux. Dalimier's ministry did not have authority to tell the funds how to invest, but he signed a letter to Dubarry saying he was sure that the funds, particularly in the Bayonne region, would be glad to invest in the cr√©dits municipaux bonds. Dubarry passed the letter on to Stavisky. In December 1933 it was found that the bonds of the Cr√©dit Municipale de Bayonne were worthless. Stavisky disappeared. The newspapers led a public outcry over the Stavisky Affair. On 3 January 1934 L'Action Fran√ßaise published two letters Dalimier had written in 1932 recommending the purchase of the Bayonne Municipal Pawnshop bonds. Apparently he had deliberately endorsed a fraud. It soon emerged that Stavisky had been charged with fraud in 1927 and his trial had been repeatedly delayed. The public prosecutor, brother-in-law of the prime minister Camille Chautemps, seemed to be involved. Stavisky was found dead in a villa near Chamonix on 8 January 1934. Dalimier resigned from the ministry on 9 January 1934. He was expelled from the Radical party on 13 March 1934. He did not run for reelection in 1936, and died at the age of 61 on 6 May 1936 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Seine.

He was a science editor who wrote on futuristic subjects, especially pertaining to human space travel.  Early life  Sheldon was born on April 13, 1893 and raised in Brockville, Ontario. His parents were Harvey Sheldon and Mary Christian (Laqeau) Sheldon. The Sheldons immigrated to the United States in 1917.  Education  Sheldon attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1916 and Master of Arts degree in 1917. He received his Ph.D. in 1920 from the University of Chicago and was an assistant professor of physics there 1918 and 1919. He later attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in New York City and received a degree in Electrical engineering in 1934.  Career  Sheldon became a physics instructor at the University of Michigan in 1922. He served as science editor of The New York Herald-Tribune from 1927‚Äì1931. He was a professor at New York University from 1927 to 1941 and Dean at University of Miami from 1946 to 1953.

In the intervening years he also served as Administrative Chairman of the Physics Department.New York University Catalogue, 1940‚Äì1941; University Bulletins; RG 1; New York University Archives, New York University. Sheldon became a professor at Roosevelt University in 1956. He was eventually promoted by president Edward J. Sparling and became the chairman of the physics department. In the 1960s he was the acting dean of faculties and a vice president of the university until his death. He was science editor of The New York Herald Tribune from 1928 to 1931. For the Tribune he wrote on futuristic subjects, that ultimately became matters of scientific interest to the general public. Likewise, he was the Prentice-Hall science editor. He is considered a pioneer in several twentieth- century scientific fields, and was a specialist in several areas of electronics. One is the conduction of electricity through crystals, which is the basic concept of modern-day electronic integrated circuits. Another was the field of ultra‚Äêhigh‚Äêradio frequencies. During World War II (1940‚Äì46), Sheldon was an independent research and development engineer. He was named Research Professor of Engineering at the University of Miami after the war. In the early 1950s he was a consultant to several industries, companies, and conglomerates, including: American Electric Power, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (1954‚Äì56) and the Office of Saline Water of the United States Department of the Interior. He was a fellow of at least four professional societies: American Association for the Advancement of Science; American Society of Mechanical Engineering; American Physical Society, and the Acoustical Society of America.  Space travel  Sheldon was a scientist who was ahead of his time, especially in space travel notions. In 1929 he wrote about the serious possibility of man visiting other planets through the use of rockets. He wrote the original introduction to The Conquest of Space by David Lasser, the first book written in English that seriously connected rocketry with space travel and the possibility of one day man visiting other planets. Sheldon was the third Ph.D member of the newly formed American Interplanetary Society founded in 1930 by G. Edward Pendray, David Lasser, and others. Inventions and discoveries  100px Colorscope Sheldon invented a precision photoelectric colorscope measurement instrument, more accurate than the human eye could detect.  He was a pioneer in neon tube designs, and in the design of cold cathode rectifiers. He was also a discoverer of selective absorption of hydrogen and nitrogen in charcoals, and a co-discoverer of actino electric effect.

The farmhouse was built about 1820 by Joseph Moody, one of the first settlers of the area after Maine gained statehood in 1820, and its barn is a mid-19th century double English barn. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history Moody Farm is located on of land in a rural area of eastern Searsmont, with the farmstead complex located at the junction of Lawry Road and Maine State Route 173. The farmhouse stands in the interior of the V created by the two roads with its barn and other farm outbuildings located across Lawry Road. The farmhouse is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. It has restrained vernacular Federal period styling, with the centered entrance flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a modest entablature. The building interior follows a center-chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule that has a winding staircase, parlor spaces to either side, with the original kitchen positioned behind the chimney. The modern kitchen and other facilities are located in an ell extending behind the main house. One of the rooms has stencilwork consistent with that of an unidentified 19th- century artist whose work extends across northern New England. Across what is now Lawry Road from the house stands a double barn. The older of the two barns is a traditional English barn, to which a second, mid-19th century barn has been appended. Other outbuildings on the property include a chicken coop and milk shed. Settlement of this area of Maine was delayed in part by legal issues surrounding portions of the Waldo Patent, which it was a part of. This land was acquired by creditors of Henry Knox, who had attempted to reconstruct the holdings of Samuel Waldo, and died financially insolvent. Joseph Moody, who arrived in Searsmont in 1827, purchased this parcel of land in 1820, and probably built this house soon afterward. It is a well-preserved local example of vernacular late Federal architecture.

In two seasons of racing she was highly tried, racing twenty-one times, winning five times and finishing second twice. As a two-year-old she won two minor races from eight attempts, but appeared to be well behind the best of her generation. In the following year she developed to become one of the best staying fillies of her generation in Europe, beating an exceptionally strong field in the Musidora Stakes at York Racecourse, finishing second in the Irish Oaks, and recording her biggest win at the same track when she won the Yorkshire Oaks. Her victories in 1981 were the first major successes for her trainer Jim Bolger. She was later transferred to the United States where she made no impact and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She has had some influence as a broodmare. Background Condessa was a \\"small, rather lightly-made\\" chestnut mare with a diamond-shaped white star bred in Ireland by D de Vere Hunt. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Condorcet, a French horse who won the Prix Omnium II in 1975 and the Prix Maurice de Nieuil in 1976. He was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. As a breeding stallion he later became most successful as a sire of National Hunt horses. Condessa's dam Varinessa made no impact as a racehorse, but was a half-sister of the Irish St. Leger winner Allangrange. She was a great-granddaughter of the influential broodmare Carpet Slipper, whose other descendants have included Big Brown, Val de Loir, Petoski, Golan, North Light and St Jovite. As a yearling Condessa was offered for sale at Goffs and was bought for 13,000 guineas by the then little-known Irish trainer Jim Bolger on behalf of Paddy Barrett. Explaining how he came to buy the filly, Bolger said \\"A man I had bought a house from gave me 20k to buy a racehorse and I got Condessa for 13k at Goffs but for the life of me could not find another with the rest of the money so had to give him 7k back. That hurt\\". Racing career =1980: two-year-old season= Condessa raced eight times as a two- year-old in 1980 at distances ranging from five furlongs to one mile. She was beaten in her first four races before winning a maiden race over seven furlongs at Gowran Park. Later that season she won the Waterford Glass Nursery at the same course and finished fifth behind Blue Wind in the Silken Glider Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. =1981: three-year-old season= Condessa began her second season by winning a minor handicap race over one and a half miles at Clonmel Racecourse in April. She was then sent to England and stepped up in class for the Group Three Lingfield Oaks Trial May and finished third behind Leap Lively and Allegretta. Four days later she started a 16/1 outsider for the Musidora Stakes over ten furlongs at York Racecourse in which her four rival included Fairy Footsteps, Madam Gay and the Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Miss Markey. Ridden by Declan Gillespie she appeared outpaced in the early stages and was in last place entering the straight but than began to make good progress. Apparently relishing the soft ground, she took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by four lengths from Madam Gay. Shortly after the race she was bought by the American Craig Singer for a fee reported to be in excess of $500,000. She was then made favourite for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot but ran poorly on firm ground and finished unplaced behind Strigida. When moved up to Group One level for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse on 18 July she was not expected to be suited by the firm ground and started a 16/1 outsider but ran well to finish second of the ten runners behind the odds-on favourite Blue Wind. On her next appearance she failed to show her best form when fourth behind the colt Magesterial in the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh. Three days after her poor showing in the Blandford Stakes, Condessa returned to York for the Group One Yorkshire Oaks on 18 August. The joint-favourites were the Nassau Stakes winner Go Leasing and the Henry Cecil-trained Home on the Range, with Condessa next in the betting on 5/1 alongside her fellow Irish challenger Overplay. The other seven runners included Leap Lively and the Lancashire Oaks winner Rhein Bridge. As in the Musidora Stakes, Condessa looked outpaced in the early stages and was towards the rear of the field approaching the final turn. At this point, the outsider Silken Knot fell heavily, sustaining a fatal injury and throwing her jockey Willie Carson to the ground. In order to avoid the prostrate Carson, Gillespie was forced to pull Condessa to the wide outside, losing several lengths in the process. The filly began to make progress in the straight but was still only fifth behind Leap Lively, Fiesta Fun, Home on the Range and Overplay a furlong from the finish. Condessa produced a strong late run, took the lead fifty yards out, and won by a neck from Leap Lively. Condessa was beaten in her three remaining races in Europe: she finished third to Gilded Vanity and Countess Tully in the Brownstown Stakes at the Curragh in August, sixth behind Alma Ata when favourite for the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September and eighteenth of twenty-four behind Gold River in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October. In the late autumn of 1981 she was sent to race in North America where she was trained by Howard M. Tesher. She ran well when seventh of fourteen behind Open Call in the Rothman's International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in October but in her two subsequent races at Aqueduct Racecourse she failed to reproduce her European form, finishing tenth in the Long Island Handicap and eleventh in the Gallant Fox Handicap. Assessment In the Irish Free Handicap for the two- year-olds of 1980, Condessa was allotted a weight of 106 pounds, 27 pounds behind the top-rated Storm Bird and 12 pounds behind the leading filly Swan Princess. In the official International Classification for 1981, Condessa was given a rating of 84, sixteen-pounds behind the top-rated horse Shergar. She was the rated the fourth best three-year-old filly in Europe behind Marwell, April Run and Blue Wind. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 121, nineteen pounds behind their horse of the year Shergar. Breeding record Condessa was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Singer in Kentucky. She produced thirteen foals and four winners between 1983 and 2000. *Conciliate, a chestnut colt, foaled in 1983, sired by Spectacular Bid.

It is currently a dependent of the Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta. History Tradition holds that the church was founded in the fifth century by the Paduan townspeople who had gone on to establish a community in what were then the islands of Rivoalto (Rialto) and Dorsoduro, and now form part of Venice. The ancient chronicler Guglielmo Ongarello claimed that the then Doge Andrea Dandolo, in gratitude for that immigrant community having built the churches of San Giacomo di Rialto and San Raffaele, among others, they were allowed to patronize the construction of this church in Padua. The earliest documentary citation of the church was from 1190, when it was elevated to a parish. Since 1386, the church commemorated the victory at the Battle of Castagnaro of forces including men under Francesco Novello da Carrara over the armies of Antonio della Scala.Historical Places of Italy - published by the magazine Illustrated History - pag.1084 - Arnoldo Mondadori editor (1972) With its proximity to the nearby market places, the church gained commissions for private altars and restoration work. The building was substantially altered starting in the sixteenth century, during the work of reorganization of the square outside. Further refurbishments took place in the following two centuries.Section derived mainly from Italian Wikipedia entry. Exterior The building is surrounded by home and commercial buildings. Only the fa√ßade facing the piazza is visible. It is in three parts, divided by pilasters topped by Corinthian capitals. The columns support a pediment topped by statues of St Clement, St Giustina and St Daniel. The tympanum of the portal is surmounted by a large rose window surrounded by terracotta decoration from the 7th and 8th centuries. A round high relief from the fourteenth century, depicts St Clement. In two niches are the statues of St. John the Baptist, and Sant'Al√≤, dated 1696. A neo-baroque belfry rises, next to the church. A dome covering the bell tower was demolished in the second half of the nineteenth century. Interior The nave is a vaulted hall with a small square apse. The first altar on the right depicts Jesus granting the keys of the church to St Peter by Pietro Damini. On the nave wall is a large canvas depicting a Sermon of St John the Baptist by Francesco Zanella. The main altarpiece depicts Pope Clement I (St Clement) surrounded by angels (1782) by Luca Ferrari from Reggio. Other paintings inside the church are by Giovanni Battista Bissoni, Giovanni Battista Rossi, Giulio Cirello.Guida per la citt√† di Padova all'amico delle belle arti by Giovanni Antonio Moschini pages 59-60. The altar of St Anthony of Padua, was provided by the \\"fratelea casolinorum\\" (Brotherhood of the grocers). The bas-relief depicts John the Baptist with the tools of the trade of grocers. The statue of St Anthony has replaced a painting of St Charles Borromeo painted by Pietro Malombra, which has been restored. Near the entrance there is a fresco attributed to Jacopo Bellini. Titian Minium, a famous Paduan sculptor, is buried in the church. Pipe organ The 18th century choir is located in the counterfacade.

Abdo Debbas was an Ottoman Greek, a native of Adana province, in the south of what is now Turkey. He was educated partly in Malta at a Christian school that aimed to teach young men to return to their own communities to preach the gospel. Debbas does not appear to have taken up the calling. Career In 1863, Debbas was a consular agent in Adana reporting to the U.S. government on exports from the region.Commercial relations of the United States with foreign countries for the year ended September 30, 1863. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1865. p. 516. By 1867 he was a vice-consul at Tarsus where he assisted American visitors and continued to supply trade statistics. He worked for the U.S. Department of State until 1882. A marble sarcophagus In January 1870, Debbas wrote to J. Augustus Johnston, the American consul in Beirut, to offer to the U.S. government a Roman marble sarcophagus with garlands that he had found in 1863. Johnston replied that the government could not accept such a gift and the item was instead agreed to be presented to an American institution recommended by Johnston.

He was involved for a long period in the academic life of the University of Pristina, and was a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo, being its chairman for seven years.Biography of Idriz Ajeti, ashak.org; accessed 22 September 2017. Life Ajeti was born on 26 June 1917 in the Tupale () village of the Upper Jablanica region in Serbia (modern Medveƒëa municipality). He finished the Serbian language elementary school in the nearby Sijarinska Banja village which he finished by 1930, and high school studies in the Royal Madrasa in Skopje in 1938. Ajeti registered in the Romanistics branch of the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb, but finished his studies after the end of World War II, precisely in 1949, graduating from the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Belgrade. From 1949-53 he taught Albanian at a high school in Pristina; from 1953-60 he worked as pedagogue in the Albanology branch of the University of Belgrade. In 1958 he gave his dissertation thesis \\"Zhvillimi historik i s√´ folmes gege t√´ shqiptar√´ve t√´ Zar√´s s√´ Dalmacis√´\\" (\\"Historical development of the Gheg dialect of the Albanians of Zara in Dalmatia\\"). In 1960 he received the academic title of Docent, and in 1968 the Professor one, at the same time lecturing in Albanian Language and Literature in the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Pristina. He was one of the initiators of the Gjurmime Albanologjike (\\"Albanological Reconnaissance\\") scientific magazine. Another achievement was the establishment of the Albanian culture seminary for the foreign albanologists. During 1969-71, Ajeti served as Director of the Albanological Institute, during 1971-73 as dean of Faculty of Philosophy in Pristina, and during 1973-75 as rector of the University of Pristina. He was also Chairman of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo during 1979-81, and 1996-99. He participated in the Orthography Congress of 1972 in Tirana, where the standard orthographic rules of the Albanian language were defined, and was a signatory. He has received several acknowledgments and honors, between others \\"7 July\\" award of the SR Serbia and the AVNOJ one. Work Ajeti's work concentrated on the research on the Albanian language dialects from the diachronic point of view, old linguistic documents written in Ottoman Alphabet, and reciprocal Albania-Serbian relations. He also touched topics on nowadays Albanian language, being an initiator and contributor to many linguistic consults and symposiums. He also co-authored Albanian language and literature textbooks for high school and college students.

In 896, he was appointed governor of Isfahan, nominally as deputy of the Dulafid Umar ibn Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz but in reality as part of Caliph al-Mu'tadid's re-establishment of direct control over the autonomous DulafidL domains in the Jibal. Isa participated in the hunt for the Dulafid Bakr ibn Abd al-Aziz, who led a guerrilla war against the Abbasids. Although driven to flight in a first encounter, in early spring 897 Isa inflicted a major defeat on the Dulafid, destroying his army and looting his camp. Bakr himself barely escaped with a few followers. On 26 January 898, Isa defeated another Dulafid, Abu Layla ibn Abd al-Aziz, near Isfahan. Abu Layla himself was killed in the battle. In July 900, Isa was recalled from Isbahan and appointed sahib al-shurta in Fars. When the Abbasid commander-in-chief, Badr al-Mu'tadidi, fell victim to the machinations of the vizier al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah in 902, Isa was among the close associates of Badr who abandoned him and instead sought clemency from the Caliph al-Muktafi. In the Battle of Hama against the Qarmatians in November 903, Isa commanded the guard of the Abbasid baggage train under the overall leadership of Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib. In the next year, when Muhammad recovered Syria and Egypt from the autonomous Tulunid dynasty, Isa was appointed as governor of Egypt. His tenure in Egypt was troubled from the start: within months, he was forced to abandon Fustat and flee to Alexandria due to a secessionist rebellion under a certain Ibrahim al-Khalanji. He was possibly the same person as a certain Muhammad ibn Ali al- Khalij, who also led a pro-Tulunid revolt at about the same time. Reinforcements arrived from Baghdad, but in late 905 an army under Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was defeated by the rebel at al-Arish before the rebel was defeated. Isa died in May 910, and was buried in Jerusalem. He was succeeded by Takin al-Khazari.

It was preserved as part of the Demosthenic corpus, though it is widely considered to be pseudo-Demosthenic, possibly written by Apollodoros himself. The speech was part of the prosecution of Neaera, a hetaera who was accused of unlawfully marrying an Athenian citizen. Though the speech claims that the case was brought for personal reasons, the date of the prosecution has led scholars to believe that it was in fact politically motivated. In common with most legal cases from ancient Athens, the outcome is unknown. The speech is important to modern scholars as the best extant biography of a woman from the classical period of ancient Greece, the most extensive surviving source on prostitution in ancient Greece, and the source of Athenian laws on adultery and citizenship which do not otherwise survive. However, it only began to receive significant attention from scholars in the 1990s, as before that period the focus of the speech on prostitution was considered to be inappropriate. Authorship Though the speech was preserved as a work of the orator Demosthenes, he was not the author. Against Neaera is preserved as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, though it has been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes, 57. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the speech was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped with the rest of the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech. Background The case against Neaera was brought by Theomnestos, the brother-in-law and son-in-law of Apollodoros. In his introduction to the speech, Theomnestos says that he is bringing the case against Neaera in order to exact revenge against her partner Stephanos for his previous attacks on Apollodoros.Pseudo-Demosthenes 59.1. The enmity between Apollodoros and Stephanos began, according to Theomnestos, when Apollodoros proposed the reallocation of the Theoric fund for military use in 349 BC in preparation for war against Macedon. Stephanos took Apollodoros to court, claiming that the law which he proposed was illegal.Pseudo-Demosthenes 59.5. The fine which Stephanos proposed was according to Theomnestos large enough that Apollodoros would have been unable to pay it, and so would have been disenfranchised.Pseudo-Demosthenes 59.6. The court in fact imposed a smaller fine, which Apollodoros was able to pay. Having failed in his attempt to have Apollodoros ruined and disenfranchised, Stephanos then had Apollodoros charged with murder. This time, Apollodoros was able to successfully defend himself, and the suit failed.Pseudo-Demosthenes 59.9-10. Following this suit, Theomnestos brought the case against Neaera from which this speech comes, on behalf of his father-in-law. The case was a graphe xenias ‚Äì the charge that Neaera had illegitimately claimed the rights of Athenian citizenship. Specifically, the case against Neaera claimed that she was living with Stephanos as his wife, when it was illegal for non-Athenians to marry Athenian citizens. The case was brought between 343 and 340 BC; Kapparis argues that an earlier date is more plausible. The fact that the rivalry between Apollodoros and Stephanos began in 349 BC, though, raises the question of why Apollodoros and Theomnestos waited for such a long time to bring the matter of Neaera to court if their sole motivation was revenge on Stephanos. Grace Macurdy suggested that the motives were in fact political, and that Apollodoros brought the case against Stephanos due to Stephanos' opposition to the anti- Macedonian policies of Eubolos and Demosthenes. She concludes that the case was ultimately to discredit Stephanos in preparation for a new proposal to redirect the money in the Theoric fund for military purposes. Carey suggests in fact it was an attempt to test public opinion to a challenge against the use of surplus money on the Theoric fund when it could instead have been used for defence against the threat of Philip of Macedon. Speech Theomnestos begins the speech by introducing the case and the reasons for it, but the bulk of the speech is made by Apollodoros. So much of the speech is made by Apollodoros that at its conclusion he claims to have brought the case against Neaera himself, having apparently forgotten that it is in fact Theomnestos' case.Pseudo-Demosthenes 59.126. Douglas MacDowell suggests that originally Apollodoros intended to bring the case himself. Apollodoros mainly focuses on attacking Neaera and her daughter Phano, possibly because he cannot produce good evidence for his allegations. He spends most of the speech going over Neaera's life as a hetaera, from her purchase by Nikarete to her going to live with Stephanos, and the failure of Phano's two marriages. He demonstrates that Neaera was not an Athenian citizen, though he \\"failed to establish conclusively\\" that Neaera was married to Stephanos, or that she passed her children off as Athenian citizens. The style of the speech differs noticeably from that of authentically Demosthenic orations. The style is considered \\"sometimes[...] rough\\" by Kapparis, with \\"endless, sometimes clumsy sentences\\". The oration makes frequent use of quoted speech, which Kapparis argues was a deliberate device to make vivid the events Apollodoros describes. The outcome of the speech is unknown, though modern commentators have criticised the evidence that Apollodoros put forward as failing to prove his case. Kapparis suggests, however, that despite the weak case for his position, Apollodoros may have been able to persuade the jury to his side by playing on their prejudices and fears. Legacy The speech Against Neaera is significant as the best extant narrative of the life of a woman in the classical period. It is the most extensive surviving source on Greek prostitution, and is also valuable for what it says about women and gender relations in the classical world. Accordingly, it is today frequently used in teaching about Athenian law and society, though due to the focus on prostitution, it was \\"not deemed appropriate for undergraduates of earlier generations\\", and so has only recently been the subject of much scholarly attention. Since 1990, Against Neaera has been the subject of much attention by classicists, including two editions with translation and commentary, and a biography of Neaera. As well as its importance for women's history, the speech has been described as a \\"very important source for Athenian law and social history\\". It is a primary source for a number of Athenian laws, including ones on adultery and citizenship. It is also the best source of evidence about the granting of Athenian citizenship to the people of Plataea for their service to Athens, after the capture of Plataea by Sparta during the Peloponnesian war.

The test is used to provide some indication of a material's coke-forming tendencies. The test results are equivalent to the test results obtained from the Conradson Carbon Residue test. Test method A quantity of sample is weighed, placed in a glass vial, and heated to 500 ¬∞C. Heating is performed in a controlled manner, for a specific period of time, and under an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere . The sample experiences coking reactions, with volatiles formed being swept away by the nitrogen. The carbonaceous residue remaining is reported as a mass percent of the original sample, and noted as ‚Äúcarbon residue (micro).‚Äù =Special considerations= *If the test result is expected to be below 0.10% (by mass), prior to performing the test, the sample can be distilled to produce a 10% (by volume) bottoms. *If the sample contains ash-forming constituents and/or non- volatile additives, these will add to the carbon residue value, and be included as part of the total reported carbon residue value. *In diesel fuel, the presence of alkyl nitrates, such as amyl nitrate, hexyl nitrate, or octyl nitrate, causes a higher carbon residue value as compared to untreated fuel. This may lead to erroneous conclusions as to the coke-forming tendencies of the fuel. Applications Micro carbon residue offers the same range of applicability as the test to which it is equivalent, Conradson Carbon Residue. Advantages of MCR include better control of test conditions, smaller samples, and less operator attention. Applications include: *For burner fuel, MCR provides an approximation of the tendency of the fuel to form deposits in vaporizing pot-type and sleeve-type burners. *For diesel fuel, MCR correlates approximately with combustion chamber deposits, provided that alkyl nitrates are absent, or if present, that the test is performed on the base fuel without additive. *For motor oil, MCR was once regarded as indicative of the amount of carbonaceous deposits the oil would form in the combustion chamber of an engine. This is now considered to be of doubtful significance due to the presence of additives in many oils. *For gas oil, MCR provides a useful correlation in the manufacture of gas there from. *For delayed cokers, the MCR of the feed correlates positively to the amount of coke that will be produced. *For fluid catalytic cracking units, the MCR of the feed can be used to estimate the feed's coke-forming tendency.

The community is located along U.S. Route 27, north of Lumpkin. Louvale has a post office with ZIP code 31814. History Originally named \\"Antioch\\", the town developing at the terminus of the Savannah, Americus, and Montgomery (Little SAM) Railroad was renamed \\"Louvale\\" in 1886. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Louvale as a town in 1893. Located in the heart of Louvale, the Louvale Church Row District is a collection of historic buildings ranging in age from the 1850s through the early 1900s. Louvale Church Row was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1986. =Antioch Institute= The Antioch Institute, built in the 1850s, the school was operated by the Antioch Primitive Baptist Church until it was sold to Stewart County in 1895. The building is believed to have been used for church services until the church building immediately next door to the school was erected for that purpose in 1885. The county operated the Louvale High School there until 1928 when the upper grades were transferred to Lumpkin. The elementary school remained in the building until 1942. The school is now used as the Louvale Community House which serves as the home for the Sybil and John B. Richardson School of Sacred Harp Singing.

It was opened by Hugo Geiger (1828‚Äì1874), a retired customs inspector, as a guest house in 1866 and then progressively extended. By 1924 there were two traditionally styled substantial hotel buildings. During its heyday in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Geiger was a leading hotel, with many financiers and aristocrats among the guests. In 1997 insolvency forced the closure of the Geiger. It has subsequently been used on a couple of occasions as a film set. Discussions have taken place about selling the site and restoring or replacing the hotel, notably in 2007, but these appear to have come to nothing, and in 2015 the site is unsold. The buildings have stood empty for more than a decade.  Location  The hotel is positioned at the southern edge of the village, on rising land, set in its own grounds approximately 50 meters from the former Bundesstra√üe (national road) 20 (now superseded by a bye-pass on the western side of the village), leading up a steep road to Berchtesgaden. There is a large annex (\\"Dependance\\") constructed to the south of the main building (\\"Haupthaus\\") and at an angle to it. Closer to the road, to the north west of the main building is a grouping of buildings including a former laundry, a former gas station and a former home of the hotelier (the \\"Schneiderh√§usl\\"). On the grounds behind the hotel on its east side are some smaller buildings constructed during the 1960s and 70s including a garage for hotel guests, indoor and outdoor swimming pools. There is also a third accommodation block dating from this period, linked to the main hotel by tunnel, and featuring more luxurious rooms than the older main hotel building and annex.  History  Industrialisation during the nineteenth century led to the rapid growth of an urban middle class in Germany with sufficient time and money to take holidays. The German word for nightmare is \\"Alptraum\\", but by 1849 romantic artists such as Ludwig Richter and Caspar David Friedrich had nevertheless shown people how to appreciate the beauty of the Alps. An early convert was King Maximilian of Bavaria who had his summer holiday palace built at Berchtesgaden. The opening in 1860 of the railway between Rosenheim and Salzburg made the region more accessible than hitherto. A rail-link to Bad Reichenhall was added in 1866, which by 1888 had been extended all the way to Berchtesgaden. Hugo Geiger (1828 - 1874) retired from the Royal Bavarian Customs Service when he was only 37, in 1865, and purchased a small farm house located between Stangga√ü (Bischofswiesen) and Berchtesgaden, intending to adapt it as a retirement home where he could live with his wife. Geiger was suffering from ill health, and his wife, who was much younger than he was, and had grown up as the daughter of a guest house owner in northern Bavaria, now took the lead in converting their fifteenth century farm house into a nineteenth century guest house. The project was accompanied by a name change, and the \\"Hienleitlehen farmhouse\\" was relaunched in 1866 as the \\"Haus Geiger\\" (guesthouse).A. Helm: Das Berchtesgadener Land im Wandel der Zeit. Berchtesgaden 1929, Nachdruck 1973, S. 101 ff. Growth in guest numbers was sustained by German unification and the new rail connections which made its easier to market the Bavarian Alps as a tourist destination, attracting visitors from Germany's burgeoning industrial regions far beyond Munich. The tourism boom persuaded the Geigers to invest in a major extension of the building in 1874, constructing an extra wing on its south-eastern side. Hugo Geiger died in 1874. The guest house was taken over by his eldest son, Franz Geiger, and his wife, Nina (born Nina Kri√ü) who was a member of the local brewing family. During the next two decades the hotel underwent major expansion and moved upmarket. In 1884 rooms in the Main Building were redesigned and elegantly furnished. The architect Wicklein was employed to design a two-storey annex (later known as the \\"Dependance\\") to the north of the main building, and this opened in 1890. By 1924 Rudolf Geiger, grandson of the hotel founder, had taken over, and that year he opened a gas/petrol station beside the hotel for the convenience of guests. It was the first gas/petrol station in the locality. The local economy received a boost in 1933 when Germany's new chancellor purchased a summer villa on the far side of Berchtesgaden a few kilometers away, and set about converting it into a summer residence fit for a leader. The Berghof became something of a German tourist attraction during the mid-1930s. Visitors gathered on nearby public paths in the hope of catching a glimpse of Hitler, which led to a proliferation of security measures and restrictions on access a few kilometers to the east of the hotel.Hoffmann, Peter. (2000). Hitler's Personal Security: Protecting the F√ºhrer 1921-1945, Da Capo Press, pp. 181‚Äì186. On the other side of the Stangga√ü district of Bischofswiesen itself, a twenty-minute walk to the west of the hotel, the authorities constructed the :Berchtesgaden Chancelry Branch office (\\"Reichskanzlei Dienststelle Berchtesgaden\\"), to which key politicians and government functionaries moved their offices when the chancellor was staying at his summer residence along the road in the other direction. By the time of the Second World War, which broke out in 1939, the Hotel Geiger had become a rest and recreation centre for Luftwaffe officers: caves and tunnels carved into the hillside to provide shelter from bombing date from this period. Early in May 1945 US and French troops arrived in the area, and at the Hotel Geiger US army officers replaced German Luftwaffe officers. One of these, John F. Kennedy, later became President of the United States. The hotel was subsequently restored to civilian use and significant development took place in 1972 when it acquired its own indoor swimming pool. Bed capacity was increased a few years later when another two floor accommodation block went up in 1976, extended with a third floor in 1982. However, on 1 November 1997, at which point the hotel had been in the Geiger family for more than 130 years, insolvency forced the closure of the hotel. Subsequently, it was used as a setting for one or two films including \\"Der Winterschl√§fer\\" and \\"Wilde H√ºhner\\". It also featured in several episodes of the vetinerary fictional series, \\"Tierarzt Dr. Quirin Engel\\" and in one episode of the light-hearted Wei√üblaue Geschichten series. The buildings continued to be heated and guarded by Stephen Geiger till Summer 1998, after which the banks foreclosed on the furnishings and the buildings began to deteriorate. The site was sold in 2017 to Bartl Wimmer: demolition of the 1960s and 1970s parts of the site started in January 2018.https://www.berchtesgadener- anzeiger.de/startseite_artikel,-abriss-des-hotel-geiger-in-vollem-gange- _arid,387118.html Celebrity guests In addition to John F. Kennedy, the guest registers disclose that Prince Maximilian of Baden, later a Chancellor of Germany, stayed at the Geiger in 1911. Other German aristocrats and princelings also visited, and in 1904 Thomas Mann was a guest. Hotel guests between 1945 and 1997 included Anwar Sadat, Walter Scheel, Pierre Trudeau, Prince Albert of Monaco, The Bee Gees and Elvis Presley.

Both albums, along with his music film Goldfieber, were downloadable for free. In 2007 he published the mixtape Schlaftabletten, Rotwein Teil II. In March 2008 he signed a contract with the German hip hop label rappers.in. Under this label he released the album In Gottes Namen, which was awarded the best demo of the month in the January/February issue of the German hip hop magazine Juice. For this issue Alligatoah produced an exclusive track.in: Juice published February 13th 2009. After successfully graduating from high school, Strobel moved to Berlin.

Refusing to hire a defense attorney, she defended herself in court and later published a book about her experiences. The case drew public attention to the highly restrictive laws against black literacy in the pre- Civil War American South.Douglass, Margaret, Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P.

By age fourteen, she had given birth to a daughter, Hannah Rosa.Margaret Douglass, Hannah Rosa Douglass, 1850 Census, Norfolk, Virginia, www. ancestry.com She also birthed a son, who died. Nothing is known about her husband. In 1845, she and her daughter relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, where she established herself in a modest apartment in a tenement neighborhood and made ends meet by running her own business as a seamstress and vest maker. She chose not to participate in social activities with her white neighbors in the nearby tenements, who she felt were \\"not of the most refined class\\". She notes in her memoir that this made her unpopular in the neighborhood. She described her life as \\"frugal and retiring\\", and that it was \\"necessary for me to labor incessantly\\".Douglass, Margaret, The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854 p.6-9 The school In 1853 she paid a business visit to the barber shop of a free black man named Robinson. Mr. Robinson was a man of influence in the community of more than 1500 free people of color who lived in Norfolk at that time.John Henderson Russell, The Free Negro in Virginia, 1619-1865 (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1913), 57-58. Digital version at Internet Archiv. His two young sons were busy studying a reading primer, so Douglass asked Robinson if there wasn't a school in town where free black children could learn to read. Robinson said that there was only the Sunday school at Christ Church where, he said, \\"they didn't learn much.\\" Douglass returned home and asked her teenaged daughter, Hannah Rosa, if she would like to tutor the boys. Hannah Rosa said she would, and the boys began to receive free reading lessons at the Douglass home, using the books they received at church. Eventually, Robinson took his sons back to the barber shop where he needed their help, and sent his two daughters instead. In her memoir, Douglass states that the two girls were intelligent, attentive, made rapid progress, and were \\"a source of pleasure to us.\\" A month later, Margaret and Hannah Rosa decided to open a small school for free black children in their home, and charge three dollars per student per quarter. Robinson spread word to the free black community, and the school was deluged with applications. For 11 months, they taught 25 children, who Douglass described as \\"well-behaved\\" and \\"anxious to be taught\\". When one of her female students grew ill, Douglass made regular visits to her home, and arranged for and participated in the girl's funeral when she died. This, according to Douglass, was not approved of by other whites in the community.Douglass, p.9-11 Arrest  On the morning of May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the children were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house. They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office. This 1849 law, like similar ones throughout the South, was the result of Southern white panic following Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831.Christine Pawley, Reading Places: Literacy, Democracy, and the Public Library in Cold War America, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2010, p.49 Under this law, it was an 'unlawful assembly' for black people to gather together to learn to read and write, punishable by whipping, and for any white person to instruct them, punishable by up to 100 dollars and six months in jail.Black Laws of Virginia, Ch. 17 \\"You have a very large family\\", Mayor Stubbs commented when she and the 25 children arrived at his office. He then asked her if she was aware of the law. Douglass responded that she didn't know teaching free black children was illegal, but that if it were illegal for her to teach the children it should also be illegal for the church to do it, since she was using the same books. The mayor dismissed the matter and sent everyone home, after assuring Douglass that nothing would happen to the black children or their families.American State Trials, p. 50 Outside the courtroom, Douglass noted that she was met by a group of free black adults, parents of the children and their friends, waiting to hear the decision and offering to pay for any penalties or bail she might incur. She gathered the children back at the school, gave them back their books and slates, and said goodbye. \\"It was a sad parting\\", she wrote in her memoir.Douglass, p.20 After her daughter Hannah Rosa left Norfolk for New York on June 29, Douglas was left alone, receiving however frequent gifts of flowers from her former students who stopped by to see her. Of the outpouring of support she received from the black community. Douglas writes, \\"In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion....May I ask what gratitude they owe to those who would degrade them? What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell him as a slave?\\"Douglass, p. 14‚Äì20 Trial Although she thought the case was now behind her, on July 13, she was served legal papers for a Grand Jury Indictment for her and her 17-year-old daughter, which stated: \\"Each of them did unlawfully assemble with diver negros, for the purpose of instructing them to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write, contrary to the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia'.American State Trials, p.49 Having little money and 'little affection for lawyers', Douglass decided to defend herself. She did not mention the upcoming trial to her daughter, who was still in New York, until September 1, when she instructed her to stay until further notice. On November 11, she entered the crowded courtroom alone, wearing a black velvet dress, white kid gloves and a plain straw bonnet. 'Everyone present seemed to be confused, except myself,' she noted.Douglass, p. 22 She called three male members of Christ's Church as her witnesses, two of them also lawyers, one who had signed the summons against her. The excitement in the courtroom when these three witnesses arrived was 'most intense', she noted. In her memoir, she states that these men, who she describes as part of the 'aristocracy' of Norfolk, were either lecturers at the church's Sunday school, or had wives and daughters who were, and had given the free black children of the community the same books she was using to teach them to read. The witnesses either denied teaching altogether or said they had only provided moral and religious instruction, but did not teach the black children how to read and write. In her closing speech to the jury, Douglass described herself as a Southern woman, a former slave-holder. She said she was not against slavery, and strongly opposed to northern abolitionist interference, though she believed their 'principles are based on a religious foundation'. She believed, she said, in 'the duty of every Southerner, morally and religiously to instruct his slaves, that they may know their duties to their masters and their common God. Let the masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in our community.' She also challenged the indifference of the white population towards the situation of the free and enslaved black population, where there was misery, starvation, and harsh laws in place to control them, noting that it was illegal for more than two or three of them to assemble in one place, for whatever reason. 'When they are sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the cattle in the field?\\" She also told the jury that although they had nothing to fear from the 'true blooded' negroes, she felt that those who had 'white blood in their veins' were 'presumptuous, treacherous, and revengeful.' \\"Ask how that white blood got beneath those tawny skins,\\" she suggested, \\"and let nature herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the authors of this devilish mischief, but not the victims of it.\\" In closing, she offered that she was willing to go to prison if she had to, but that the black anti-literacy law, she said, was 'one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced the statute book of a civilized community.' American State Trials, p. 50 When she rested her case, the judge asked if anyone wanted to speak in her favor. No one came forward. Douglass successfully argued for dropping the charges against Hannah Rosa, since she was still a minor. At the close of the trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found her guilty, and fined her one dollar. She then left for New York to retrieve her daughter. Sentencing and jail On January 10, 1854, she was called back before Judge Baker for further sentencing. The Judge noted that some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you spoke of the colored race in general'. 'Such opinions I regard as manifestly mischievous', he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a \\"matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats,\\" and who \\"scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti- slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy\\". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a 'far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, 'is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and 'something more substantial is required in this case'. 'For these reasons', he continued, 'as an example to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for the period of one month in the jail of this city'.The Case of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, Africans in America, PBS.com Douglass served out her sentence. Having no where else to stay when she was released, the jailer and his wife put her up for two days before she moved with her daughter to Philadelphia. Media coverage The case received substantial media coverage at the time, both for and against Douglass and the anti-literacy law. Under the headline \\"Her Own Lawyer,\\" an editor in the Petersburg Daily Express wrote of how the courtroom was 'filled with persons anxious to witness the novel spectacle' of a woman defending herself and compared her speech making abilities to renowned feminists like Lucy Stone.Her Own Lawyer, Petersburg Daily Express, 1853, cited in Douglass Despite her disavowal of abolitionism, she was hailed as a heroine by abolitionists. William Lloyd Garrison, in his abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, noted that a Quaker woman in Norfolk had delivered a sermon on Douglass' behalf while Douglass was in jail and stated, \\"The women are a great trouble to our Norfolk neighbors\\", he said. \\"If they want peace, they will have to expel all Christian women... from the city.\\" Garrison, William LLoyd, The Liberator, November, 1853, cited in Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery, John McKivigan, Mitchell Snay University of Georgia Press, p. 187 The editor of the Virginia newspaper The Argus wrote that although the Norfolk community was reluctant to put a white woman in prison, 'there rose a righteous indignation towards a person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and brave the imprisonment for 'the cause of humanity' '. 'Let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments unworthy of a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution\\", he wrote. In the religious publication Covenanter: Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, (Volume 9, 1853) David Smith called upon the Presbyterian General Assembly to intercede with the U.S. government to \\"secure for all its citizens the rights of teaching human beings to read the language of their country...\\" He noted that the United States government had interceded when Presbyterian women had been imprisoned in foreign Catholic countries for passing out Bibles, but would not intervene in Douglas's case. The case, Smith said, has \\"exposed the country to the contempt and hissing of every civilized country on earth\\".Covenanter, Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Volume 9, 1853 Memoir and legacy In 1854, Douglass published her memoir of the event, Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman, who was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, Under the Laws of Virginia, for the Crime of Teaching Free Colored Children to Read. In it, she describes the trial as well as the events that led up to it, and includes the speech she made in her own self-defense. As she did in her courtroom speech, she criticizes the black literacy and assembly laws as well as white indifference to the situation of blacks, but identifies herself as a Southern supporter of slavery, and a white supremacist: \\"I have been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary or practicable, I might be such again\\".https://archive.org/stream/personalnarrativ1854doug#page/5/mode/1up Pointing out that many of the black and mixed race children she was teaching were the children of the same white men who aided in the prosecution against her, she lays some of the blame for the condition of black people on Southern white men who sexually abused enslaved black women. This, she believed, is the root of the anti-literacy law. \\"How important then for these Southern Sultans that the objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance and degradation\\", she writes. She speaks of the silent frustration of white women who know of their husbands' 'tawny mistresses' and the powerlessness of black women, who have \\"parents, brothers, sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner or later overshadow the whole land.\\" She ends her memoir calling upon her white \\"Southern sisters\\" to remedy this situation: \\"I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influence of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands\\".Douglass Little is known about Margaret Douglass's life after her trial. In June 1865 the members of the free black community of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were still in place in their community.http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/freedom/text5/equalsuffrage.pdf The law was abolished in 1867. Documents and publications about Douglass's trial and her subsequent memoir have helped shed light on the era she lived in for scholars of American history, race relations, women's history, religion and law.Joshua Rhodes Balme Hamilton, \\"American States,Churches and Slavery\\" Adams and Company, 1864: Christopher Lasch, Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism, W.W. Norton and Co, 1997 One legal scholar wrote that with the case of Margaret Douglass: \\"The modern era of Anglo-American Law had arrived early, and the principal actor had been, appropriately, a woman. Her jury speech had, appropriately, employed the female metaphor of the family, in which all the children deserved equality of treatment. It was a metaphor, and an idea, that would come to dominate the legal discourse of America.\\" The Life of the Law: The People and Cases that Have Shaped Our Society, By Alfred H. Knight.

Sokolov was considered one of the Eastern Europe's best goalkeepers during his career. He is regarded as the first goalkeeper who began to leave the goal line like modern keepers and even Lev Yashin said Sokolov was his inspiration.

He also played football for Coventry City and Walsall. He was born in Chilvers Coton, Warwickshire, and died in Nuneaton, also in Warwickshire. Wilmot was a right- handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast swing bowler. He played in occasional first eleven matches for Warwickshire from 1931, but made little impact until 1935 when he improved his personal best bowling figures twice in the game against Leicestershire, taking five wickets for 91 runs in the second innings. In 1936, he played in more than half of Warwickshire's matches, and in the game against Surrey he achieved the best bowling figures of his career, with seven wickets for 34 runs in the first innings and four for 56 in the second, giving match figures of 11 for 90. Wilmot's career did not, however, take off after this success: in 1937, he played in only a few matches and although he was a fairly regular member of the side in both 1938 and 1939, he did not take five wickets in an innings again and his seasonal total of wickets never exceeded the 38 he achieved in both 1936 and 1938. For most of his career, his batting was negligible, and only the presence in the Warwickshire side of Eric Hollies kept him from occupying the No 11 batting position. In 1939, however, he made a great improvement and averaged 26 with the bat for the season; his two scores of more than 50 both came in this season and with the higher of them, a score of 54, he shared an eighth-wicket partnership with Tom Dollery which remains a Warwickshire record in first- class games against Derbyshire.

Oxford University Press. p. 804 He received his PhD in zoology from Columbia University in 1906. He spent years conducting experiments on the effects of alcohol on germ cells, embryos and offspring. Stockard tested the effects of alcohol intoxication on the offspring of pregnant guinea pigs. He discovered that repeated alcohol intoxication in the guinea pigs produced defects and malformations in their offspring that was passed down to two or more generations. His results were challenged by the biologist Raymond Pearl who performed the same experiments with chickens.Blumberg, Mark S. (2010). Freaks of Nature: And What They Tell Us about Evolution and Development. Oxford University Press. pp. 69‚Äì70. Pearl discovered that the offspring of the chickens that had been exposed to alcohol were not defected but were healthy. He attributed his findings to the detrimental effects of alcohol only on the eggs and sperm which were already weak, the strong eggs and sperm were unaffected by alcohol intoxication. Pearl argued that his results had a Darwinian, not a Lamarckian explanation.

The capture was conducted by an English, French Huguenot, and Fleming force led by Colonel de Poyet. A small assault force led by Walter Morgan captured the main gate which enabled the complete surprise of the garrison, most of whom were put to the sword.Caldecott-Baird pp 99-102Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 45 Events =Background= The Spanish held town of Middelburg was under siege, which relied on a Spanish fleet to relieve the place. The Sea Beggars (known as the Guezen) however were successful in defeating and holding any relief attempts the Spanish made in the waters of Zeeland in April at the Battle of Borsele. A second Spanish relief force was turned back after Fort Rammekens surrendered to an Anglo-Rebel force in August. A beggar fleet as a result was able to sail and meet up with the Prince of Orange at Dordrecht. A small force was detached which consisted of English, Scottish, French Huguenot, and Flemish soldiers led by a French Huguenot Lieutenant Colonel de Poyet, numbering 300, with its aim of the capture of Geertruidenberg. The fleet sailed in the night towards the city. The garrison in Geertruidenberg composed of a company of Walloons from Crist√≥bal de Mondrag√≥n's regiment, which included a number of Spanish officers, led by a French nobleman Captain Draek, in total a hundred and seventy men. The Protestant force landed at night on the coast of North Brabant and approached the city. =Capture= In the early morning of August 31, 1573, Colonel de Poyet ordered Walter Morgan and a Frenchman Captain Malion with eighteen hand-picked troops, including four Dutchmen who had lived and worked in the city, to scale the ramparts of the city and to open the Breda Gate. This was the key to the city, and, once opened, the attackers would be able to attack the city with speed and surprise. They went unnoticed, scaled the walls, then dispatched the sleeping guards, after which they were able to open the gate and let in the main force. The garrison troops then only became aware that the city was under attack and were taken completely by surprise. They attempted to fight back but all were killed, and only a few managed to escape, including Captain Draek; though wounded in the back he escaped through a back window. In his haste he had left on the table the entire pay to his men, much to the delight of the attackers. The citizens were treated fairly well, despite a priest being killed and a monk hanged. An English soldier recalled that this was the first city to be captured for over a year and was a major boost to the morale of the Protestant forces. Only a few of the garrison escaped including Draek and they then fled to Breda. =Aftermath= After a garrison was established Poyet and Morgan returned via Dordrecht. The prince appointed Jerome Tseraarts as the garrison commander of Geertruidenberg, in whom he put great trust. On September 8, the first Protestant sermon was held. The city stayed in States hands until April 1589 when an English and Dutch garrison under John Wingfield sold the place to the Spanish under the Duke of Parma.Luc Duerloo p 46 The Spanish occupation would not last however and on June 25, 1593 after a siege the city was back in Dutch hands for good.Ungerer p 128  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography    * Geertruidenberg (1573) Geertruidenberg (1573) Geertruidenberg (1573) Geertruidenberg (1573) 1573 in the Dutch Republic Conflicts in 1573 History of North Brabant Geertruidenberg ","title":"Capture of Geertruidenberg (1573)"},{"id":"48623492","text":"Vladyslav Shapoval (; born 8 May 1995 in Chernihiv, Ukraine) is a professional Ukrainian football defender who currently plays for the Ukrainian First League club Volyn Lutsk.

Creation  The original concept was \\"animal with naked woman\\"; the animal became a machine and the human disappeared. The work of art was first created as a geometric sketch from which a small model was developed. The next step was a large polystyrene model, which was then \\"ore-machined\\". The sculpture was cast in the Hermann Noack art foundry. The employees of the bronze foundry were involved in this step to guarantee a stable basic structure on which the details could be built. The final processing of the surfaces including mechanical and chemical treatment was also carried out by the Noack specialists. According to the artist, models for his work of art were: the Nautilus, Emma the steam locomotive, Lok 1414, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, vehicles from Mad Max films, Ben Hur's chariot, the Snow Queen's sleigh, the Sandman's vehicle and the time machine. Meese characterizes his bronze object as forward-looking: \\"The baby spaceship flies forward only, without a rear- view mirror, without a railing and without nostalgia, great, great, great.\\"  Reception  Plaque for the sculpture, 2013 Gallery owner Philipp Haverkampf said that the work is a crazy mixture of time machine, spaceship and the sled of the sandman. When you look at it, you can see bizarre details such as geometric shapes, the Iron Cross and a beer bottle. According to Der Tagesspiegel, the term 'Humpty Dumpty' in the title refers to the talking egg in Lewis Carroll's children's book Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.

History Castello Lanzun was originally built in the 15th century as a farmhouse. It gets its name from Wenzu Lanzun (Lorenzo Lanzon), a man from Birgu who lived there during the 1676 plague epidemic. Castello Lanzun's courtyard The farmhouse was modified and enlarged in 1713, and it was fortified so as to be able to provide refuge for the local population in case of a corsair raid. It was also used as a hunting lodge by the Grand Master of the Order of St. John. In World War II, the building served as an observation post to identify approaching enemy aircraft, and it was severely damaged by aerial bombardment. In 1972, the farmhouse was purchased by Robert Gayre, who restored the building and handed it to the Malta obedience of the Military and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem. It was formally inaugurated as the Order's official headquarters on 12 May 1973 by Grand Master Francisco de Borb√≥n y Borb√≥n. The property is in the custody of the Grand Commandery of the Castello (formerly the Commandery of Lochore). The tower was visited by Patriarch Gregory III Laham on 17 April 2010.

It never took place because Portugal agreed to an Allied request for use of air bases. The islands were of enormous strategic value regarding the defeat of the German U-boats. Portugal, too weak to defend the Azores, or its large colonial empire, or even its homeland, tried to stay neutral in the war. Dictator Salazar was especially worried about a possible German invasion through Spain and did not want to provoke Hitler nor did he want to give Spain an excuse to take side with the Axis and invade Portugal due to the strategic importance of the Canary Islands. Great Britain and the United States devised plans to set up air bases regardless of Portugal's disapproval. The plans were never put into operation. Instead in 1943 Britain requested, and Portugal agreed, to allow Britain to set up bases there. Operation Alacrity was preceded by War Plan Gray.  Overview  The 1st U.S. Aeronautical company in Ponta Delgada (21 January 1918); one of the first completely equipped American aviation units to serve overseas in World War I Since their colonization in the 15th Century the Azores islands became a bastion of Portuguese power protecting lines of communications to its overseas empire. The advent of flight increased the strategic importance of the Azores. During World War I it allowed the US to establish naval bases in Horta and Ponta Delgada and in 1918 as an official in the Navy Department Franklin D. Roosevelt made a stopover in the Azores, and was quite taken with the strategic value of the new American naval base there. In May 1919, with World War I ended, the first successful transatlantic flight took place from the United States to Great Britain by three U.S. Navy \\"Curtiss Flyer\\" flying boats. They used the harbor of Horta on the Azorean island of Faial as a critical stopover in their flight. In the 1930s Pan American Airways flew the first regularly scheduled commercial airliners, \\"Pan-Am Clippers\\" (Sikorsky S-40 flying boats), from Norfolk, VA to the Azores and then on to Europe.Guill, James H. \\"A History of the Azores Islands\\", Vol. 5 (Tulare, CA: Golden Shield Publications, 1993), pg. 508, 510. In the outbreak of the Second World War Salazar‚Äôs dislike of the Nazi regime in Germany and its imperial ambitions was tempered only by his view of the German Reich as a bastion against the spread of communism. He had favoured the Spanish nationalist cause, fearing a communist invasion of Portugal, yet he was uneasy at the prospect of a Spanish government bolstered by strong ties with the Axis. Salazar's policy of neutrality for Portugal in World War II thus included a strategic component. The country still held overseas territories that, because of their poor economic development, could not adequately defend themselves from military attack. Upon the start of World War II in 1939, the Portuguese Government announced, on 1 September, that the 600-year-old Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact, but that since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal was free to remain neutral in the war and would do so. In an aide-m√©moire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding. In 1940 the Portuguese Navy finally established a permanent Air-Navy Centre in Ponta Delgada. By the spring of 1941, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar began to believe that Germany, or its allies, would completely overrun the Iberian Peninsula. As a consequence, the Estado Novo regime pondered the withdrawal of the Portuguese government to the Azores, with the support of Britain. It was in this context that an Anglo-Portuguese working group was established to study and design the construction of new airfields in the archipelago. During 1940‚Äì41 the US, Britain and Germany each made plans to occupy the islands. Despite the fact that the islands were only 720 miles from Lisbon and 2100 from New York, in 1940 Roosevelt considered including both the Azores and Cape Verde Islands under the Monroe Doctrine of 1825. Roosevelt declared that German occupation of the Azores or the Cape Verde Islands would compromise US safety and on 22 May 1941 he directed the U.S. Army and Navy to draft an official plan, War Plan Gray, to occupy the Portuguese Azores. Along May and June 1941 the American attitude towards de Azores evolved into a diplomatic incident, due to the insinuations of the American press regarding the preemptive occupation of the Azores by the USA, which would later be confirmed by a Senator Claude Pepper in a landmark speech and, afterwards, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äüs speech on 27 May 1941. The Portuguese sovereignty over the islands of the archipelago of the Azores was not considered in any of the speeches, which resulted in an enormous Portuguese diplomatic campaign throughout Washington D.C. But on 22 June 1941 the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and while so involved, the Germans were unlikely to invade Great Britain and would also have to relax their pressure on the Atlantic. In a letter dated July 8, 1941, intending to dismiss \\"false reports\\" that impaired relations between the United States and Portugal, President Roosevelt assured Salazar: \\"May I say first of all that, in the opinion of the Government of the United States, the continued exercise of unimpaired and sovereign jurisdiction by the Government of Portugal over the territory of Portugal itself, over the Azores and over all Portuguese colonies offers complete assurance of security to the Western Hemisphere insofar as the regions mentioned are concerned. It is, consequently, the consistent desire of the United States that there be no infringement of Portuguese sovereign control over those territories. In 1941, Portuguese officials recognizing the dangers of the Azores in German hands, expanded the runway and sent additional troops and equipment to Lajes including Gladiator aircraft. The Portuguese declared the base capable of air defense on 11 July 1941. To emphasize Portuguese sovereignty over the territory the President of Portugal, General Carmona, made a high profile visit to the Azores in July and August 1941 and his message was \\"Aqui √© Portugal\\" (Portugal is here). However, in August 1941, during the Atlantic Conference, President Roosevelt revived the plans to seize the Azores. But while German victories on the Eastern Front revived fears in the Atlantic all the attempts to give new life to the Azores project failed. In December 1941, In a pre-emptive strike, Dutch and Australian troops invaded Portuguese Timor and Portugal immediately protested at the violation of her neutrality. Troops were dispatched from mainland Portugal but were still in the middle of the Indian Ocean when the Japanese invaded Portuguese Timor in January 1942. Salazar's protests concerning the violation of his country's sovereignty and neutrality by the Allies and subsequent Japanese invasion of Portuguese territory, would become a strong argument for Portugal not wanting to concede further facilities to the allied cause. A Vickers Wellington Mk XIV, No. 172 Squadron RAF undergoing servicing at Lajes airfield during 1944 By 1943 American military strength had significantly increased and successes in North Africa Campaign had greatly reduced the chances of a German occupation of Iberia in retaliation against an allied seizure of the Azores. In May, in the Third Washington Conference, codenamed Trident, the conferees agreed that the occupation of the Azores was essential to the conduct of the anti-U-boat campaign, extending Allied air cover for convoys and increasing harassing activities against U-boats. Delighted with the American stance Churchill cabled home with instructions: Portugal should be informed that if it refused to hand over the base, the Azores would be occupied. However, Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell, the British Ambassador considered the US State Department's suggestion \\"particularly ill-timed and incomprehensible at the present juncture.\\" He recalled that at the outset of the war, Salazar had remained neutral with British approval. Campbell saw Salazar as fundamentally loyal to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance and stated that \\"he [Salazar] would answer the call if it were made on grounds of dire necessity\\". The opposition to seize the Azores using military force also came from Anthony Eden, to whom the violation of the Portuguese neutrality could destroy the moral foundation of a true community of sovereign nations. Campbell and Eden were right, when in August 1943 the British requested military base facilities in the Azores, invoking the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, Salazar responded favorably and quickly: Portugal allowed these bases, letting the British use the Azorean ports of Horta (on the island of Faial) and Ponta Delgada (on the island of S√£o Miguel), and the airfields of Lajes Field (on Terceira Island) and Santana Field (on S√£o Miguel Island). Franklin Roosevelt promptly informed Winston Churchill that the United States wanted to approach directly the Portuguese government for the purpose of also obtaining aviation facilities in the Azores. The negotiations for the agreement between the United States and Portugal, conducted initially by George Kennan Charg√© d‚ÄôAffairs in Portugal, were long and complex. The final agreement was signed in November 28, 1944 between US ambassador Raymond Henry Norweb and Salazar.

It is a 40 mm guided munition that can be fired from the barrel of a Heckler & Koch M320 Grenade Launcher Module and Enhanced Grenade Launching Module (EGLM) like a standard 40mm grenade, but is powered by a rocket motor to propel it to give infantrymen improved extended-range precision capabilities. The weapon uses a digital, semi-active laser seeker to guide itself to within 5 meters of the target; it can operate in a two-man shooter/spotter team or by the grenadier alone lazing after firing, as it can fly for 15 seconds before homing in. When fired, Pike has a small propellant to \\"kick\\" it out of the tube before the nearly smokeless motor ignites, and range is dependent on firing angle. The munition is effective against fixed and slow-moving mid-range targets, using a blast fragmentation warhead with a 10-meter lethality radius. Raytheon developed the weapon for three years in collaboration with Nammo Talley, which developed the warhead and propulsion system. The Pike is intended to be more accurate with a longer range than rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and standard grenades, while being far lighter and more cost-effective than current infantry guided weapons like the FGM-148 Javelin. Further improvements could include different fuses, multiple-round simultaneous programming and targeting with data-link capabilities, and platform integration onto small boats, vehicles, and small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Pike weighs and is long, too long to fit in the breech of the M203 grenade launcher.

He was born into a prosperous and socially prominent family in Nashville, and had considerable advantages as far as education and upbringing. Despite this, his avocation as an airplane pilot turned to cocaine trafficking on a large scale. According to one judge, Brothers became \\"the giant among giants\\" in international smuggling. Brothers made his money by flying planes loaded with large amounts of cocaine from Colombia to the Bahamas, then transporting the cocaine by high-speed boats to south Florida and from there to Tennessee, and eventually to Canada. The millions of dollars in profits were directed to banks in Belgium, Gibraltar, Montreal, Panama, and Costa Rica. These funds were then reinvested locally in order to launder the money. Brothers testified that he would fly as much as 600 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to the Bahamas, then to Nashville, unload the bags into a van, then take them to his Belle Meade home. From there he would take the cocaine to his family's Williamson County farm, where Canadian purchasers would pick it up. Early life Brothers grew up in Belle Meade, a well-to-do suburb of Nashville. His grandfather and father jointly ran a wholesale grocery business, the M.P. Brothers Company. His father, Russell W. Brothers Sr., was one of the founders of Nashville's Baptist Hospital and owned three businesses: the Velvet Ice Cream Company (1949‚Äì1970), the Anthony Pure Milk Company, and the Russell W. Brothers Insurance Company. The junior Brothers attended Montgomery Bell Academy (MBA), a private Nashville prep school for boys. In 1956, his senior year, he played fullback for MBA's state championship football team. The quarterback was Thomas F. Frist, Jr. who later co-founded Hospital Corporation of America and became one of the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans. The halfback was Frank Drowota, who later became the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Brothers was awarded a football scholarship to Vanderbilt University. He is the father of four children. His businesses included a coal company, an insurance agency, and a brokerage company for airplanes. In his airplane brokerage business during the 1980s, he began selling planes for cash to clients who were cocaine smugglers. When his coal business developed financial problems he turned to criminal activity. Testifying in federal court, Brothers stated, \\"Through my connection of knowing these people, I asked them if I could become involved in their business.. . . I did, and I was successful\\". First conviction He was convicted in Florida's Broward County Circuit Court on October 24, 1988, on charges of racketeering, trafficking, and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. According to Broward Circuit Judge Patti Englander Henning, Brothers' operation included bribing U.S. Customs officials. The conviction allowed the state to confiscate Brothers' property because it was deemed obtained by illegal means. Approximately $6 million in real estate and other assets was confiscated in what authorities called the largest seizure of property in Florida's history at that time. It included a 248-acre farm near Nashville, a restaurant, two airplanes, two boats, a $600,000 loan to a ranch in Limestone County, Texas, and an aircraft-chartering firm. He was fined $1 million and sentenced to 60 years in prison, of which he served 11 years. Second conviction In 1992, while incarcerated, Brothers was served with a federal criminal complaint charging him with money-laundering and additional drug trafficking. Brothers' attorney, G. Thomas Nebel, was suspected as having a role on the laundering of the money and was charged, as well as Brothers' cousin, Thomas Brothers, a Davidson County (Nashville) Circuit Court Judge. As a private attorney before being appointed judge, Judge Thomas Brothers did some work for his cousin, Russell Brothers, in 1986. Federal prosecutors tried to prove that Thomas Brothers knowingly helped Russell Brothers conceal a source of his income and channel almost $1 million into a farm on West Harpeth Road, near Franklin, Tennessee. At his own trial, Thomas Brothers was acquitted on the charges, as well as two money-laundering charges. Nebel was an attorney who had previously represented Russell Brothers, his former golf partner. Federal prosecutors contended that Nebel invested more than $5 million of Brothers' drug-smuggling profits and then lied to investigators when asked about his role in the case. Nebel was offered immunity from prosecution if he would testify as to Brothers' criminal activities, including setting up companies that received drug money. The testimony resulted in Brothers being convicted in 1993 on charges of money-laundering and additional counts of cocaine trafficking . Also in 1992, Russell Brothers offered substantial assistance to prosecutors, including testifying and giving information in the federal prosecution of another accused drug trafficker, Allan Ross. For this testimony, Brothers' sentence was subsequently reduced making him eligible for immediate release on parole. Airplane ransom incident In 2010, Brothers allegedly loaned a business partner $12,000 to close on a real estate transaction. After a dispute occurred when payment was delayed, Brothers was seen on surveillance cameras absconding with the partner's $300,000 airplane from Nashville's John C. Tune Airport. The plane was flown to nearby Dickson, Tennessee, and sequestered pending repayment. Brothers is alleged to have set up a meeting at a west Nashville restaurant with the partner and settle the debt. The partner arrived at the meeting with police, and Brothers was charged with felony theft. Third conviction On the night of April 20, 2012, Brothers, age 75, was piloting a private plane solo from Miami, Florida, to Dickson, Tennessee. After mechanical trouble, he crash-landed his 1961 vintage twin-engine Beechcraft airplane without landing gear on a grassy area at the closed and decommissioned Cornelia Fort Airpark, now a city park in Nashville. The belly-landing was soft enough that the plane's automatic crash locator which would have alerted authorities was not triggered. Uninjured, Brothers left the scene and did not notify any authorities. His wife picked him up, and the plane was left as a mystery for the police to solve. A maintenance worker saw the plane, but did not alert authorities until it was still there the following morning. The police traced the plane to Brothers and six days later searched his home. They found 16 firearms, including handguns, rifles, and shotguns. Due to his conviction as a felon 24 years prior, it was unlawful for him to possess firearms. A federal grand jury issued a five-count indictment which, in addition to the weapons possession, included obstruction of justice. Brothers pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to the weapons charge and also to obstruction of a federal investigation, receiving a 15-month jail sentence.

The statue measures . It depicts an androgynous shepherd herding five sheep. The subject of the statue reflects the former use of Paternoster Row as the site of Newgate Market for the sale of livestock and meat, and may also have theological overtones of the Good Shepherd, reflecting its position in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral. It may draw inspiration from husbandry in the C√©vennes region of France, where Frink spent time at the vineyard of her second husband Edward Pool in the late 1960s to early 1970s, or from Picasso's 1944 sculpture Man with Sheep, and may also play on the religious and linguistic similarity between the Latin paternoster (\\"our father\\") and pastor (shepherd).

It is an eight-storey-tall modernist concrete structure built in the mid-1970s. Located on a high outcrop of ground overlooking downtown, it is one of the tallest buildings in the city, and claims to be the largest hotel in Northern Canada; it has also been described as the city's best and grandest. It is owned and operated by Nunastar Properties. Members of three generations of the Canadian Royal Family‚ÄîQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Prince William and his wife Duchess Catherine‚Äîhave stayed at the Explorer on their visits to Yellowknife; it is also a popular destination for tourists who come to the city to see the northern lights. Before the territory's Legislative Assembly had its own building, it often met in the hotel's conference rooms. It underwent renovations in the 1990s, a small expansion in 2008, and in late 2015 the city granted permits for a larger expansion, even as a competing hotel project has been planned for a neighbouring property. Building and grounds The Explorer is located at the northwestern edge of the area of downtown Yellowknife known as New Town, the city's main business district, at the intersection of 48th Street and 49th Avenue. It is on a sharp rise in the land, at an elevation of . On its south and east are developed urban streets in a grid pattern; two blocks to the southeast, at the junction of 48th street and 50th (Franklin) Avenue is the YK Centre, a high-rise that is home to Canada's northernmost enclosed shopping mall. Two blocks to the southwest is the headquarters of the Canadian military's Joint Task Force (North). On the north and west the land is much less developed. A patch of taiga with outcrops of bedrock, typical terrain for Yellowknife and its surroundings, is to the north. On its northwest a bluff descends to a cleared lot awaiting the construction of another hotel and a wetland that gives way to Niven Lake to the north, with a newer residential area beyond. Across 48th is the territorial visitors' centre, with the entrance roads of the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre and Northwest Territories Legislative Building to their west, set amongst more taiga, and Frame Lake to the south. A paved driveway leads north into an unpaved parking lot from 49th. On a slope at the north end of the lot stands inuksuk. The driveway continues through a large paved porte-coch√®re to a smaller northern parking lot on higher ground. =Exterior= The hotel building itself is an eight-storey unadorned rectangular 4-by-14-bay concrete-faced structure with a flat roof. The main entrance is located under the porte-coch√®re on the west (front) elevation. A two-storey wing projects from the south end. There is also a one-storey wing at ground level on the east. In the middle the top of the elevator shaft creates the appearance of two wings.See accompanying photo. On the upper stories, all bays of the west fa√ßade are set with fixed windows in the centre of a plain panel on a slight projecting portico. The panels and windows of the southern eight bays themselves project slightly; a single narrow projecting panel is located just north of the eighth bay. The ninth bay is recessed almost to the building face; its windows are located on the south end of a flush panel. On the four bays to the south the windows are again centred but the panels are flush. A plain dark course divides all the storeys.See accompanying photo. The north face is completely blind. On its western side is a projecting section with some openings for mechanicals at ground level and a large illuminated sign with the hotel's logo at the top. The eastern side has two flush panels, a narrow central one and regular-width one at the east. On the east the treatment is mostly similar to the opposite fa√ßade. However, all bays project and the window is centred in each. There is a corresponding recess between the eighth and ninth bays but it is much narrower. The south fa√ßade, also blind, has two normal-width panels at each corner and a shorter one in the centre where a plain staircase tower rises.

History Originally a staging area for bush pilots heading for destinations further north, Yellowknife began to grow as a settlement in its own right when gold was discovered in the late 1930s. After a brief pause during the years of World War II, the growth continued in the 1950s, with the New Town being built to augment the Old Town, the original, more rustic city, on the peninsula leading into Great Slave Lake. In 1967, at the recommendation of the Carrothers Commission, the city was designated the capital of the Northwest Territories (which at the time included what is now Nunavut), making it as important politically as well as commercially. With this new importance came visitors used to traveling in style. Construction on the Explorer, a hotel meant to cater to them, began in 1974 and completed in 1976. It was strategically located in a topographically prominent position along the highway leading from the airport to downtown. At that time it had 117 rooms. By the end of the decade the hotel had played host to Prince Charles, who stayed there when he traveled to Yellowknife to speak at the dedication ceremonies for the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre across the road. Actor Leonard Nimoy also stayed there at one point, as have Rick Mercer, Peter MacKay and former Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper. The territory's legislative assembly sometimes held meetings at the Explorer until its own building was constructed further down 49th in 1993. The following year Queen Elizabeth II and her husband and consort, Prince Philip, stayed at the Explorer on their visit to Yellowknife. Also during the 1990s, the hotel expanded for the first time, adding 10 rooms on its second floor. In 2004 Grandfield Pacific, the hotel's then-owner, agreed to sell it to Nunastar Properties, an Edmonton-based company which also owned the Frobisher Inn in Iqaluit, the territorial capital of recently created Nunavut, for CDN$6.35 million. Nunastar announced at the time that it planned significant renovations. \\"We plan to make it Yellowknife's premier hotel for business travellers,\\" said Nunastar president Doug Cox. The $2.4 million project began in 2007, with local firm Clark Builders handling the construction. By early 2008 it was finished, adding 60 more rooms. \\"I'm excited,\\" said Rainer Launhardt, the Nunastar executive who supervised the expansion. \\"The bathrooms will be larger, and the rooms will be better‚Äîbetter being a relative term, seeing as how the rest of the hotel underwent renovations only two years ago.\\" As part of the renovation, the Alex Janvier mural that had been in the lobby was moved to a dedicated banquet/conference room. The hotel invited him to refurbish the mural; he took advantage of the opportunity to expand and update it as well. The room was named for him. Three years afterwards, the expanded hotel welcomed a third generation of the British royal family as guests when Prince William and his wife, Duchess Catherine, stayed there on their visit to Yellowknife shortly after their 2011 wedding. During their stay, the couple took meals in their suite to avoid creating a scene at the restaurant. A special menu was created for them reflecting their preference for eating light, consisting of English muffins and similar foods. Among the guests at the expanded hotel were many visitors from Japan, who usually come during the cold and dark winter months to see the northern lights. In October 2014, one Japanese tourist, Atsumi Yoshikubo, was discovered to be missing when staff at the Explorer went to her room two days after she had failed to check out and found her bags, all packed. She herself had last been seen three days earlier walking down the Ingraham Highway west of the hotel, shortly after its own security cameras had recorded her leaving; many Yellowknifers took it upon themselves to search the expanses of taiga surrounding the city over the next week and a half until the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said their investigations led them to believe that Yoshikubo had intended to commit suicide by walking into the wilderness. Human remains, later identified in 2016 as that of Yoshikubo's, were found in a patch of woods off the highway near her personal effects 10 months later. Around the time Yoshikubo's remains were found, the city approved plans for the Explorer's largest expansion yet. The hotel proposes to build a new wing on the west side of the current building's north end. It would add 72 more rooms, bringing its total to 259, and an additional banquet/conference room. The proposal was approved as another developer was also planning a 146-room hotel for the property next door, meant to compete with the Explorer.

All rooms have free Wi-Fi, complimentary coffee, clock radio, telephone and television with remote control. Deluxe rooms offer a choice of one king or two queen size beds with a flat screen television and iPod-compatible clock radio, along with a media charging station and work desk with ergonomic chair. Rooms on the second floor are wheelchair accessible. Suites are also available. The executive suites offer a king-size bed, kitchenette, wet bar, fireplace and a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. The junior suites are designed with business travelers in mind and have more work space and related amenities. All rooms and suites are non-smoking. The Explorer's conference rooms, which it says are the largest in Yellowknife, can handle groups as large as 350. The largest, the Katimavik (meaning \\"place of meeting\\" in Inuktitut), can be subdivided three ways. The smaller Janvier room is equipped with modern multimedia presentation technology, including a wall-height projection screen. Other amenities available for guests within the hotel are business and fitness centres. The former consists of two separate computer workstations with high- speed Internet and printers. The latter, located on the hotel's lower level, offers treadmills, exercise bikes, ellipticals and free weights. A shuttle bus service to the airport operates daily until midnight. Since many international guests come to see the northern lights, the hotel also books those tours for them as well. The hotel itself has also been singled out for the views it offers over Yellowknife in all directions.

It was recorded by Grammy award-winning producer Vance Powell and consists of eleven original songs. The album features appearances from several notable guests including Howlin‚Äô Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin, Dr. John, former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor and Patrick Carney of The Black Keys. Hubert Sumlin's contribution proved to be the last music he made prior to his death on 4 December 2011. Recorded in analogue to tape, Petit described the album as \\"vinyl-centric\\", with the track running order chosen specifically to fit the Side A and Side B vinyl format. Pre- production and Recording Sessions at Blackbird Studios Petit began writing material for Cracking The Code in the spring of 2011. In an interview with Blues Matters magazine, Petit spoke of his initial plans for the album: \\"After The Crave I‚Äôd got a good idea of what I wanted the next album to sound like - which was to have the crackle of a live album in a studio setting with some boundary-pushing sonic experiences based around guitar-driven, blues-based music. I didn't want a set of well-recorded songs, I wanted something with a noise of its own, some sort of character.\\" In order to realise his vision, Petit approached producer Vance Powell to work on the album. Petit was drawn to Powell due to his work with Jack White and was particularly impressed by Vance's production ethos with The Dead Weather: > \\"He was already doing some of those things [I wanted]‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs got what Eddie > Kramer or Sam Phillips had back in the day‚Ä¶ he encourages you to try new > sounds and ideas‚Ä¶ Before we began [\\"Muzzle\\"] I said to Vance \\"I want this > song to sound like a monster\\" and he just said \\"OK\\". He knew exactly what to > do.\\" Pre-production rehearsals for the album were undertaken throughout Spring 2011 and in August 2011 Petit and his band flew out to Blackbird Studios in Nashville to track the album. The recording sessions for tracking lasted for five days, with Petit staying behind for another three to begin overdubs. Capturing the live sound of the band was a central priority for Petit. Talking with Blues Matters, he explained \\"I wanted to get that thing that you can get with people who know each other just playing in a room.\\" The band tracked the album live, performing in the same room and using microphone placement to help capture the ambience and natural reverbs of the room. In an interview with Musicosis, Petit revealed he wanted the record to sound as \\"organic\\" as possible. Petit's production ethos for Cracking The Code was in keeping with his mission to present the blues in a modern way, push boundaries and deliver something new to the audience, he revealed to Guitar & Bass Magazine: \\"When The Stones‚Äô Satisfaction was first heard it was completely extraordinary. There was never anything like it before. I am striving to get there and in some instances I think we achieved it - with \\"Muzzle\\" and \\"Slideway\\" certainly... Somebody listening to \\"Slideway\\" said about halfway through \\"Are my speakers damaged? Is it supposed to sound like that?\\" I was so happy because I did want it to sound like that - shards of sound and untidiness in the distortion. I didn‚Äôt want it to be polished.\\" Petit also wanted to try a new \\"less is more\\" tact when it came to tracking guitar on the album - while previous album The Crave had featured multiple layers of guitar tracks, Petit's aim with Cracking The Code was different, he explained: \\"I wanted to reach a place where there is one guitar that is massive and huge‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want the distortion to be tidy; I wanted it to be ragged\\". Upon returning to London, Petit experienced a \\"mental blockage\\" which left him temporarily unable to finish some of the songs for Cracking The Code: \\"Some of the songs were finished, some of the songs had the hook without the verse, and some had no lyrics at all. I wanted to make sure that the lyrics matched the calibre of the music.\\" After watching a documentary about Paul Simon's Graceland, in which Simon discusses his struggle to finish the album, Petit found the inspiration needed to complete the lyrics for Cracking The Code: \\"What unpicked it for me was watching one of those Classic Album documentaries on TV about Graceland with Paul Simon going through the same thing: coming back from South Africa with some tracks that were half completed and not many lyrics. He even contemplated putting Graceland out as an instrumental album because he thought he might ruin it. And I thought \\"if someone of that calibre can go through that and come out the other side then I certainly can.\\" Petit turned the delay to his advantage and arranged recording sessions with Hubert Sumlin and Dr. John. Album Guest Appearances =Recording session with Hubert Sumlin= The recording sessions with Hubert Sumlin saw Petit travel to Barbershop Studios, New Jersey in November 2011. Taking material recorded at Blackbird with him, Petit had originally planned for Sumlin to guest on \\"Get You Off\\" and for the pair of them to then record a second song from scratch. Unfortunately, Sumlin's deteriorating health led to the session ending earlier than planned. Sumlin overdubbed guitar parts on \\"Get You Off\\" but the pair did not have the opportunity to record a finished version of the second collaborative song. This song later became \\"Hubert‚Äôs Blues\\". Despite Sumlin's evident fragility, his impressive musicianship remained intact even during his final weeks: \\"I had to help him up the stairs but when I put a guitar in his hands he was like a different man.\\" Petit further elaborated to Guitar & Bass Magazine: \\"I placed my [Gibson SG] in his hands and he instantly changed. He became really animated‚Ä¶ half an hour later he said, \\"it‚Äôs mine, it's going home with me!\\" It was the last guitar he ever played.\\" After Sumlin had left the studio, Petit used the remainder of the session to record guitar parts for the collaborative piece himself, channeling Sumlin‚Äôs riffs from earlier run throughs and using Sumlin‚Äôs amplifier. Following Sumlin‚Äôs death, Petit set about turning the recording into an homage and suitable tribute to Sumlin, bringing in revered bluesmen Dr. John, Chris Barber and Mick Taylor to play on the song, now titled \\"Hubert‚Äôs Blues\\". \\"I bumped into Dr. John, who was supposed to play at [Hubert‚Äôs] memorial, but hadn‚Äôt, and I had this stuff, which was the last music Hubert ever made‚Ä¶ so I felt a duty of care. I asked [Dr. John] to help me finish it and he agreed.\\" Hubert Sumlin died 13 days after the recording session for Cracking The Code and the album captures his last ever recorded performance. Sumlin also posthumously provided inspiration for lead-off single \\"Holla\\". Petit recalled: \\"I‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame we‚Äôve got all these people celebrating [Hubert] and he‚Äôs not on [Hubert‚Äôs Blues]. So I went back to the tape of Hubert and I arranging the song and picked out the bits that might work. And then there was this riff that came blaring out that I had scarcely noticed. And that became the basis of Holla. That‚Äôs Hubert coming out of the right speaker and me on the left.\\" During the session, Sumlin made a point of waiting for the two of them to be alone before saying to Petit \\"I‚Äôll tell you something Steve‚Ä¶you can play! You can not only play, but, if a lot of people could play like you, shit, I‚Äôd sit back and smile.\\" Petit commented that the recording session with Sumlin was \\"life-changing\\". In tribute to Sumlin, \\"HCS 4eva\\" (Hubert Charles Sumlin) is etched into the run out groove of all vinyl copies of the album. =Recording session with Dr. John= Introduced to Dr. John by mutual friends, Petit mentioned his idea to create a musical tribute for Hubert Sumlin and asked Dr. John to play organ on the track. In Autumn 2012, Petit flew to New Orleans for the session. Dr. John appears on both \\"Hubert‚Äôs Blues\\" and \\"Get You Off\\". =Other guests= The album also features Patrick Carney on drums in lead-off track \\"Holla\\", whom Petit met after a show by Carney‚Äôs band The Black Keys. Carney resides in Nashville, where the album was recorded. Guitarist Mick Taylor and jazz trombonist Chris Barber also appear on the album and have been long-term collaborators with Petit since their involvement in his successful campaign to \\"Save The 100 Club\\" in December 2010. Their contributions were recorded at Petit‚Äôs home studio in late 2012. Mick Taylor spoke of Cracking The Code to Guitar & Bass Magazine: \\"I went to see Bill Wyman‚Äôs Rhythm Kings and when I went to meet Bill backstage there were a few guitar fanatics there. A few of them said \\"we really enjoyed your playing on the Stephen Dale Petit album\\" it was nice to be paid compliments for something other than what I did with the Rolling Stones but something just as important.\\" The lyrics on the album were written by Petit except \\"Shotgun Venus\\", which saw another collaboration between Petit and performance poet Pete Brown, famed for his songwriting with British blues rock pioneers Cream in the 1960s (they previously co-wrote the title track on Petit's album The Crave). Commenting on the album's guest appearances, UK music journalist Henry Yates wrote that Petit keeps \\"hallowed company, but [he] is their equal.\\" Post-production, Limited Edition Vinyl and Album Artwork Cracking The Code was recorded, mixed, mastered and cut from analogue tape in Nashville. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd and cut by George Ingram at Nashville Record Productions. It was released on CD, digital download and black vinyl with a special limited edition, heavyweight pressing of 333 signed and numbered red vinyl copies. All vinyl albums were issued with a gatefold sleeve and oversized lyric booklet handwritten by Petit himself. Petit discussed his choice of title for the album with Guitar & Bass magazine: > \\"I once heard an acclaimed songwriter say creating a song comes in any > number of ways; it‚Äôs just finding a way in, spending time with it and > allowing it to come to fruition‚Ä¶ she called it \\"cracking the code\\". Once I > decided on the title, it became clear that it meant a lot of things. And so > I let that happen.\\" The conclusive factor in deciding the title was Vance > Powell arriving in London for the vocal sessions with a book in his luggage > about Bletchley Park - the former site of the United Kingdom‚Äôs Government > Code and Cypher School, which was responsible for cracking the secret codes > of the Axis powers during WWII including the German Enigma Code. Petit has > stated that this was \\"a coincidence that confirmed the choice.\\" =Album Artwork= The album artwork, shot in Hill Garden, Hampstead Heath, draws inspiration from seminal rock album design company Hipgnosis. Upon inadvertently discovering the location for the cover, Petit presented his ideas for the cover to Hipgnosis principle Storm Thorgerson, aiming to collaborate with the legendary album cover artist for the shoot. This did not materialise due to Thorgerson's deteriorating health. Discussing the new album with iconic rock photographer and guitarists‚Äô muse Pattie Boyd, it was decided that she would photograph the cover image. After Petit presented his initial mock-up shots to Boyd, work began on location in Spring 2013. The shot features Petit seemingly walking on water, surrounded by white balloons suspended in mid-air. Petit has since revealed that it was Boyd who suggested he stand in the middle of the pond featured in the image to create the illusion. \\"There‚Äôs nothing faked. I‚Äôm actually standing on a table with about a millimetre of water beneath my shoe. Those balloons are suspended by bricks and tied with fishing line.\\" The white balloons featured on the album artwork were specifically arranged into three groups of three balloons to represent the number sequence 333. In keeping with the album's title, the gatefold sleeve of Cracking The Code includes numerous secret codes in various forms. At the top of the gatefold, written in braille, is the phrase \\"blues is truth\\". The bottom of the sleeve features \\"blues is truth\\" written in numeric code. Similarly, the album credits also contains a red letter code that spells out \\"blues is truth\\" in anagram format. Critical Reception and Press Coverage Critical praise for Cracking The Code was consistent, with most leading press outlets agreeing that Petit's third studio album was a showcase for his \\"formidable\\"ongwriting skills and his \\"fiendish guitar chops\\" s. Blues Matters magazine commented that the album transported Petit \\"to the next level\\". Legendary UK music journalist Charles Shaar Murray agreed, deeming the album Petit's \\"graduation piece\\". Writing for The Blues, Shaar Murray notes: \\"[Petit] rises to the challenge that most New Blues players are guitarists first, singers second and songwriters a distant, trailing third. Previous records established his credentials as guitar hero and ace blues geek, but now he‚Äôs found his voice.\\" Cracking The Code received an 8/10 star review in Classic Rock as well as being listed as one the magazine's best albums of 2013. Hi-Fi News magazine awarded the Vinyl release of Cracking The Code a score of 88/100, describing the album as a \\"an excellent modern blues LP‚Ä¶ a fiery, kick-ass session\\". MOJO magazine's 4/5 star review described the album as \\"thrusting blues hooligan anthems‚Ä¶ an inspired and unapologetically loud affair.\\". In its review, The Daily Express commented \\"the whole history of blues, certainly electric blues, is on this album\\" and added that \\"Petit‚Äôs electrifying guitar and gutsy vocals are the drive behind this musical tour de force‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a master craftsman at the top of his game.\\" Pre-eminent UK guitar magazine Guitar & Bass ran a five-page feature on Petit following the album's release and described Petit as \\"another Jack White at work\\". Singles Lead single \\"Holla\\" circulated on BBC Radio 2, including plays on The Paul Jones show, The Bob Harris show and Gideon Coe. \\"Holla\\" also appeared on the compilation disc \\"The Black Keys and Friends\\" for the June 2014 issue of MOJO magazine. MOJO Editor in Chief Phil Alexander played Cracking The Code on his own syndicated MOJO Rocks Radio Show, naming it album of the week and playing most of the album over a two-month period. Follow up single \\"My Friend Bob\\" also featured on BBC Radio nationwide. The Times described the song as \\"ultra- catchy\\" and included it in their \\"hottest tracks\\" playlist. \\"My Friend Bob\\" received a 5/5 star rating from The Express, writing that the single was \\"a standout track, one hundred per cent toe-tapping‚Ä¶ once heard it never fails to bring a smile.\\" Rough Trade West record store in London participated in a viral promotional campaign for \\"My Friend Bob\\" offering 33 free copies of the single in store.

From Exodus to Freedom: A History of the Soviet Jewry Movement. Rowman & Littlefield. p. 50.  Activism  Beginning in 1978, Cohen traveled throughout the U.S.S.R. to visit Jewish emigration activists and Refuseniks, Jews who were refused emigration visas, to bring out information and to develop strategies for UCSJ's grass roots support. In 1989 Cohen led an international delegation, representing five countries, to the Soviet Union to hold the historic first open meeting between Jews of the Soviet Union and Jews of the West and Israel. Later that year, at the request of the Refusenik activists, she traveled again to Moscow for the opening of the Solomon Mikhoels Cultural Center. In 1991, she returned to Russia for a Round Table of Human Rights, co-sponsored by the Union of Councils, with participation of indigenous human rights and democratic leaders. She also led a UCSJ team to Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to assess the situation of Jews in the Soviet Muslim Republics and returned to Kyrgyzstan the following year with a UCSJ delegation to conduct an International Symposium on Human Rights as requested by local Jewish leadership. In the same year, she participated in a Human Rights Experts meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, co- sponsored by UCSJ. Cohen has participated in numerous international and national conferences on the issues of Soviet Jewish emigration, Soviet anti- Semitism, and the right to Jewish identity in the former Soviet Union. On behalf of the Union of Councils, she attended three separate sessions of the Vienna Follow-Up Meeting of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE); the 1989 CSCE Paris Conference of the Human Dimensions; the Paris CSCE Summit 1990; the Copenhagen Conference of the Human Dimension in 1990; the 1991 Moscow Conference of the Human Dimension and served as a public member of the official U.S. delegation to the CSCE Conference on Minorities in Geneva, Switzerland in 1991. She traveled to Israel on bi-annual basis with UCSJ activists to debrief Jews who were able to receive visas. Pamela Cohen established networks for transferring information to and from Refuseniks throughout the U.S.S.R. and maintained regular telephone contacts with activists during the darkest days for Soviet Jewry. She testified at Congressional hearings on the state of Soviet emigration policy and state- sponsored anti-Semitism during the Soviet era and participated regularly in briefings for the Congress, the White House, departments of State, Commerce and Defense. She participated in briefings for President Reagan, Secretaries of the State Schultz, Baker and for Condoleezza Rice, during her tenure with the National Security Council. In 1992 she was a guest at the White House for the State dinner during the Summit between Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. In 1995, Pamela Cohen and Rabbi Ezra Belsky co-founded Komimiyus, the Deerfield, Illinois-based North Shore Torah Center, an independent grass roots education center dedicated to Jewish classical education for adults in Chicago area.  Awards  During the course of her service, Cohen has received the Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award from the Raoul Wallenberg Committee of Chicago in 1981 and the Edward J. Sparling Award from Roosevelt University's Alumni Association. In 1989, during the UCSJ Conference in Moscow, Pamela Cohen was given the Medal of Honor by grass roots Soviet Jewish activists and leaders for her achievements on behalf of Soviet Jewry. In 1997, she received a degree of Doctor of Human Letters from Spertus College of Judaica. References External links *Papers of Pamela B.

She was an advocate for the support of science in public health causes, including collaborating with Hilary Koprowski to support polio vaccine work.

Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2011 Her parents were Frank Kent Thomas and Elizabeth R. Wilson, both who died early in the Middlesex County, Massachusetts area. She attended Boston University and graduated in 1925. She was married to Roy Waldo Miner, a curator of zoology at the American Museum of Natural History, 23 Jun 1926 in North Adams, Berkshire, Massachusetts. He was a former President of the New York Academy of Sciences.The Roy W. Miner Papers, New York Academy of Sciences Archives. Among her many friends was the renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead, whom she met while both women were working as research assistants at the American Museum of Natural History. During her retirement years, she moved to Florida. She died on March 18, 1993, in Florida. Career Miner served as the Director of the Marine Historical Museum, a board member of the International Foundation for Sciences, Director of the National Paraplegia Fund, and many different administrative roles at the New York Academy of Sciences. She was appointed to the position of Executive Secretary of the New York Academy of Sciences in October 1939 by the Scientific Council of the Academy. Her first efforts as the Executive Secretary were to conduct a series of membership drives which, according to Simon Baatz, the success of which \\"relied more heavily on a gregarious nature than on the scientific merits of the organization.\\" By 1948, the membership of the Academy was at 4,000 and required the Academy to find a new home outside of the two rooms provided as meeting space by the American Museum of Natural History. The Academy launched a $1,000,000 fund drive for the purchase of a new home. Part of Miner's responsibilities in the fundraising campaign included soliciting donations from wealthy philanthropists including Normal Woolworth. Woolworth was \\"so impressed by Miner's eloquence, energy, and enthusiasm that, upon learning of the Academy search for a new home, simply donated his mansion with the sole requirement that the Academy pay all the necessary legal fees involved in the transfer.\\" While Miner was successful in securing the Academy a new home, there is little evidence that the Academy was successful in raising $1,000,000. However, the campaign did raise enough funds to refurbish the Woolworth house which was donated to the Academy as a $1,000,000 gift in 1948. These updates allowed the Academy to thrive as a central meeting place in the New York scientific community for special events and conferences. Miner retired as Executive Director of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1967. At the time of her retirement, the Academy held a special symposium to honor her great achievements for the institution at the Annual Meeting. The Academy cited her as the source of the increase in membership from 350 members in 1939 to more than 26,000 by 1967.

The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (), also known as The Malachite Maid, is a legendary creature from Slavic mythology and a Russian fairy tale character, the mountain spirit from the legends of the Ural miners and the Mistress of the Ural Mountains of Russia. In the national folktales and legends, she is depicted as an extremely beautiful green-eyed young woman in a malachite gown or as a lizard with a crown. She has been viewed as the patroness of miners, the protector and owner of hidden underground riches, the one who can either permit or prevent the mining of stones and metals in certain places. \\"The Copper Mountain\\" is the Gumyoshevsky mine, the oldest mine of the Ural Mountains, which was called \\"The Copper Mountain\\" or simply \\"The Mountain\\" by the populace. It is now located in the town of Polevskoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast. In some regions of the Ural Mountains, the image of the Mistress is connected with another female creature from the local folktales, the Azov Girl (), the enchanted girl or princess who lives inside Mount Azov.Blazhes 1983, p. 7. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain became a well known character from her appearance in Pavel Bazhov's collection of the Ural Mountains folktales (also known as skaz) called The Malachite Box. The Mistress appears in the third skaz, \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\", and in 9 other stories from the collection, including \\"The Stone Flower\\", \\"The Manager's Boot-Soles\\", and \\"Sochen and His Stones\\". Characteristics The Mistress of the Copper Mountain has the appearance of an extremely beautiful young woman with green eyes. Some of her more distinctive features include dark braided hair, ribbons from thin tinkling copper, and a gown that is made from malachite. She wears a diadem decorated with malachite and precious stones. As a mountain spirit, she is the protector and owner of hidden underground riches. She is said to be always surrounded by her servants, small lizards, which can be green, blue, golden or luminous.Shvabauer 2009, p. 63. The Mistress can appear as a lizard herself. According to the legends, a person who sees the Mistress comes under her spell. She shows kindness to good people and skilled craftsmen, helping them to find jewels and gold, but if her conditions aren't met, the person loses all his luck, skill and can even die.Blazhes 1983, p. 9. She could permit or prevent the mining in certain places, give or take wealth. The sacral being, the Mistress was surrounded by rituals and taboos, e.g. women did not come down in the mine, because it was the Mistress's domain, and young men seeking her patronage did not marry. The violation of the taboos was supposed to bring a harsh punishment. Children were taught not to shout and quarrel next to the stones, and to keep quiet in the mines, because, according to popular belief, the Maid disliked loud noises.Nikulina 2003, p. 78. Her distinguishing attributes were lizards, copper and malachite.  Other names  The Mistress of the Copper Mountain has many other names, such as The Stone Mother (),Nikulina 2003, p. 77. The Stone Maiden (),Bazhov 1952, p. 241. The Serpent Mistress, The Lizard Queen, The Mistress of the Copper Mine, The Malachite Girl, The Malachite MaidBazhov 1950s, p. 14. or The Malachite Lady (). The miners simply called her \\"Herself\\". =The Azov Girl= In many national folktales, the Mistress and Azovka (lit. \\"the Azov Girl\\") are identical with each other,Blazhes 1983, p. 10. and the same stories are told about each of them. The tales about Azovka are very different from one another, although they share some common characteristics. Firstly, that there's a cave with hidden treasures inside Mount Azov. Secondly, few people found the cave, and no one could get the treasures. The treasures belong to the Tatars, the Bashkirs, or \\"the Old People\\". According to popular belief, Azovka lives/is held captive inside the cave (or the mountain), and she guards the treasures. In most tales, she is the enchanted girl, possibly stolen by the Tatars, the cursed Tatar princess, the Old People's queen or their elder's daughter.Shvabauer 2009, p. 113.Blazhes 1983, p. 8.

Bazhov confirmed that he based the character on local legends. He said: \\"Yes, I believe that the series of tales connected with the Gumyoshevsky mine is closer to folklore. In my opinion, they represent the attempt to reconstruct the folklore of this mine\\". When asked whether the character from his writing differs from its folklore interpretation, Bazhov replied: \\"I don't believe there is a difference. If there is, it is bad [news]\\".Mironov, A. \\"Obraz Hozjajki Mednoj gory v skazah P. P.

In \\"The Stone Flower\\" it's said that the Mistress has her own \\"mountain craftsmen\\": > They're skilful craftsmen who live in the mountain, and no man ever sees > them. Whatever the Mistress wants, they make it for her. I saw a bit of > their work once. [...] Our serpents, no matter how good they are, they're > but stone, but this was like as if it was living.

In \\"The Manager's Boot-Soles\\" it's said that the Mistress \\"didn't like it when folks were treated ill underground\\".Bazhov 1950s, pp. 112. She appears before the cruel bailiff: > All of a sudden the bailiff saw a figure in front of him. It was moving > lightly, waving a lamp. At the turn of the gallery he saw it was a woman. > [...] He started running after her, but his faithful men weren't in any > great hurry to follow. They were all shaking.

[...] The bailiff saw a maid of amazing beauty > standing before him, and here brows were drawn together in a line and her > eyes blazed like burning coals.Bazhov 1950s, pp. 114‚Äì115. In The Malachite Box, she serves as a \\"magic helper\\" to the characters.Balina 2013, p. 269. \\"It's a chancy thing to meet her, it brings woe for a bad man\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 20. She can be reached through the stone forest.Shvabauer 2009, p. 146. She is cruel and just, she dislikes greedy people and is indifferent toward their suffering, but she shows her benevolent side to those with talent and selflessness.Meshcherova 2014, p. 33. Valentin Blazhes stated that in the Malachite Box she is a classical ambivalent character, because she combines good and evil, life and death, beauty and ugliness. Nataliya Shvabauer commented that her duality is represented in her every trait, from the appearance to her functions. Even her jokes can be deadly, as evident from \\"Sochen and His Stones\\". =In other media= The character Queen of the Copper Mountain appeared in Mercedes Lackey's 2007 novel Fortune's Fool. Shimun Vrochek authored a story called The Master of the Copper Mountain (), in which he mentioned the character. It was published in his Serzhantu Nikto Ne Zvonit collection in 2006. Vladimir Makanin wrote the Mistress parody characters in some of his stories, such as the mother of the character Kolka in his 1976 short story \\"Voices\\" ().  Origin and development  Sverdlovsk coat of arms (1973). The Lizard Queen (on the right) in the old Sysert coat of arms (1982). Pavel Bazhov had heard the tales about her at the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant from the miners' storyteller Vasily Hmelinin (), nicknamed \\"Grandpa Slyshko\\" by children. \\"The Copper Mountain\\" is believed to be the Gumyoshevsky mine, the oldest mine of the Ural Mountains. It was sometimes called \\"The Copper Mountain\\" or simply \\"The Mountain\\" by the populace. Valery Dyomin commented that the Mistress is a universal mytheme, while the Copper mountain is the specific location: the Gumyoshevsky mine and Mount Azov. The origin of the character is unclear. A concept of a mother goddess or Mother Earth was very popular in every culture, including the local Mansi and Khanty people. The Ural ethnographer A. Sagalayev suggested that the character originated from the goddesses Umay and Kaltes-Ekwa. He noted that the figure of a mother goddess in people's perception sometimes shrinks to the size of a rock and a sculpture or expands to the size of a mountain. The Mistress might have appeared as a successor of Azovka, because she was most famous in the same areas as Azovka before her, so the keeper of treasures slowly turned into their master.Shvabauer 2009, p. 147. Bazhov believed that the most ancient creature of the Ural mythology was in fact Azovka, the Great Serpent appeared next, and the last one was the Mistress. Just like Azovka, the Malachite Maid attracts single men.Shvabauer 2009, p. 153. Mark Lipovetsky commented her black hair colour hints at her non-Slavic parentage, possibly from the \\"Old People\\", like Azovka. Dark-haired and mysterious, she does not look like typical Russian girls.Meshcherova 2014, p. 32. Bazhov believed that miners simply missed women, because their work allowed for little contact with them. He also thought that the Mistress outgrew her initial function of a treasure keeper. She became \\"the embodiment of power, wealth and beauty\\" which revealed itself only before the best of people. E. Kulikova theorized that her place in the Ural mythology is most likely connected with the perception of the mountains as \\"magical space\\". The mountain was the source of life, the protector from hostile forces and the residence of divine patrons. Alexei Ivanov suggested that the Mistress most likely originates from a spirit of place as a \\"stone dryad\\". There is also a hypothesis that she repsesents the Roman goddess Venus, as local copper from the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant was branded with the Venus symbol (‚ôÄ) for tens of years in the 18th century. V. Bezrukova theorizes that the Mistress of the Copper Mountain symbolizes the \\"relationship\\" between people and the mountain riches, and that she in fact protects Christian virtues, e.g. she prevents greed, encourages kindness, modesty, honor and skill (Christian virtues). However Alexei Ivanov argues that she reveals her \\"genetic relationship\\" with pagan gods, and her ethics is not Christian. In one of the stories she takes the gold out of the mine after a church is built nearby.Shvabauer 2009, p. 150. Maya Nikulina points at her relation to the realm of the dead, as she does not ear or drink, does not leave any traces, her clothing is made of stone and so on, and the Mountain connects her to the world of the living. The character might be of Finno-Ugric origin. The Finno-Ugric peoples, who lived in that area, later migrated to the Baltic Sea or assimilated into the new Russian culture. Their folklore featured the underground riches, moral and spiritual powers, impersonated in Chthonic deities, mining and metallurgic techniques unknown to Russians. The Mistress's attributes‚Äîlizards, copper and malachite‚Äîare not Christian. Nataliya Shvabauer commented that the lizards are foul supernatural creatures.Shvabauer 2009, p. 149. The images of lizards and snakes were found on the Permian bronze casts (the 5-15 centuries) around Mount Azov. Copper was a symbol of female beauty at the Urals. Malachite symbolized youth, hope, misfortune and grief at the same time. The craftsmen who worked with malachite often died of tuberculosis, affected by the poisonous malachite dust. The gemcutters produced malachite jewellery for sale only, but never wore it themselves. Keeping it in the house was a bad omen.  Reception  The Mistress became a popular character in the Soviet Union. The folklorists of the Ural State University, who collected tales near Sysert after Pavel Bazhov's death, noted they \\"have not met a single person who did not hear about the Mistress\\", but they mostly knew about her from Bazhov's skazy and referred to them: \\"Read some Bazhov, he wrote it down\\". Few story-tellers heard of her from oral tradition. During Soviet times critics commonly described this character as the protector of the working class from the oppressors. Maya Nikulina argued that the Mistress is neither the rescuer nor the protector. Rather than defending the workers, she tests them. Social justice is of no concern to her: \\"the landlord is punished for being greedy and stupid\\", not for being the landlord.Nikulina 2003, p. 80. Mark Lipovetsky commented that she is the most terrifying characters of the collection, a beautiful girl and a dangerous demonic creature at the same time.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 217. He believed that she represents the struggle and unity between Eros and Thanatos,Lipovetsky 2014, p. 220. and that she is characterized by three major Freudian motives‚Äîthe sexual drive, the death drive (her realm is the realm of the dead) and the castration anxiety (loss of power). The latter is shown when she persistently and spitefully provokes the local administration, forcing the protagonists (\\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\", \\"The Two Lizards\\") to relay offensive messages.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 222‚Äì223. Denis Zherdev pointed out that the Mistress's female domain is the world of chaos, destruction or spontaneous uncontrolled acts of creation. Colliding with the ordered factory world, such power brings in randomness, variability, unpredictability and capriciousness. Direct contact with it is a violation of world order, and does not end well. The author of The Fairy Tale Encyclopedia suggests that the Mistress represents the conflict between human kind and nature. She compares the character with Mephistopheles, because a human needs to wager his soul with her in order to get the ultimate knowledge, however, the Mistress does not force anyone to abandon their moral values, and therefore \\"is not painted in dark colours\\". Lyudmila Skorino believed that she represented the nature of the Urals, which inspires a creative person with its beauty.Bazhov 1952, p. 232.

Global report on psoriasis. . WHO Press, Geneva, 2016, p16.  Questionnaire description  There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient‚Äôs life over the previous week.http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/dermatology/quality-of-life/dermatology-quality- of-life-index-dlqi/  Language availability  The DLQI has been translated into over 115 languages. The full translations are available at the Cardiff University Department of Dermatology website.Cardiff University Department of Dermatology website www.cardiff.ac.uk/dermatology/quality-of-life/dermatology- quality-of-life-index-dlqi/  Scoring  Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).  Meaning of DLQI scores  A series of validated ‚Äúband descriptors‚Äù were described in 2005 to give meaning to the scores of the DLQI.Hongbo Y, Thomas CL, Harrison MA. Salek MS, Finlay AY. Translating the science of quality of life into practice: what do Dermatology Life Quality Index scores mean? Journal of Investigative Dermatology 2005; 125: 659-664. These bands are as follows: 0-1 = No effect on patient‚Äôs life, 2-5 = Small effect, 6-10 = Moderate effect, 11-20 = Very large effect, 21-30 = Extremely large effect. The Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is the score difference that is the minimum meaningful difference for a patient. Although previously considered to be 5,Khilji FA, Gonzalez M, Finlay AY. Clinical meaning of change in Dermatology Life Quality Index scores.

Following initial reviews, the channel's video of the game was picked by a number of English- language publications and later internationally. The creator of the game was allegedly a man from Lubbock, Texas named Gary Graves. The current whereabouts of Obscure Horror Corner are unknown.  History  In an interview with Kotaku, the channel's owner claims to have downloaded the game from a Tor hidden service after receiving a tip from an anonymous subscriber. The subscriber in turn claims to have found the link via a deep web internet forum, from a user only known as \\"ZK\\" Initially, some followers were skeptical of the game, fearing it may contain gore or child pornography. However, the owner of Obscure Horror Corner shared that, so far in his playthroughs, the game had not contained any such material. Following the Kotaku interview, the subreddit \\"/r/sadsatan\\" was formed on the website Reddit to discuss the game and quickly realized the .onion address provided by Obscure Horror Corner contained invalid characters. Three days later, another interview with the Obscure Horror Corner owner appeared on Kotaku, claiming that the link was purposefully given in error since the game itself did in fact contain such graphic material and the Obscure Horror Corner channel owner did not want to be responsible for disseminating such material. In an update to the Kotaku article, Patricia Hernandez states: Minutes before the update, a new version of the game was posted to 4chan by someone claiming to be ZK, claiming that Obscure Horror Corner had not been showing their viewers the \\"true\\" Sad Satan. Members of the 4chan community downloaded this version of the game and attempted to play it. Some users complained that their computers began running sluggishly, and a few even reported that their computers became completely unresponsive while trying to run the game. A few users even reported that their computers would not turn on anymore after running this version of the game. One Reddit user attempted to play the game from a Live USB instead of from his computer's main hard drive. Later, when this user tried to boot up his computer, the computer failed to start up normally. This version of the game, dubbed the \\"clone\\" by most of the /r/sadsatan community, contained images of violent gore and child pornography, some of which were accessible right from the title screen; resulting in another version of the game with this graphic material removed (which is often called the \\"clean\\" version) being created by Redditors and subsequently redistributed. In 2017, a man from Lubbock, Texas named Gary Graves was arrested on counts of child pornography possession, he ran a YouTube channel Scarebere which had posted a video titled Sad Sad Satan. The YouTube channel in question can be traced back to a Reddit account that was created 4 days before the post containing the link to the \\"clone\\" was posted on 4chan, the Reddit account that was created was ScarebereZK. Another video found on the channel also showed a middle aged man, the credits in the video identified him as Gary Graves. The man in the video is identical to another Gary found in the 2017 Lubbock criminal registry; which led some to assume that Gary was indeed the creator and poster of the \\"clone\\" game. = Speculation = Sad Satan was the last game covered by Obscure Horror Corner, and since then, the YouTube channel has been abandoned for unknown reasons. There has been speculation that the game was in fact created by the owner of Obscure Horror Corner in an effort to increase viewer subscription count, and that the Deep Web story was a complete fabrication to give the whole account more intrigue. Some believe that Obscure Horror Corner created the clone as well in an attempt to lend credibility to the claim that there was actually gore and child pornography in the game. It is also possible that Sad Satan was not created by the owner of Obscure Horror Corner, and that in truth, the owner of the channel decided to go into hiding because of all the controversy after the malware version of Sad Satan was released. Others also speculate that ZK and the owner of Obscure Horror Corner are the same individual.  Content  The original game posted by Obscure Horror Corner features walking down monochromatic corridors while various audio samples are played and looped over each other. Audio in the game leans heavily on recordings of interviews with various murderers, such as Charles Manson. The game also depends heavily on distorted or reversed audio of such interviews or musical clips, such as the song I love Beijing Tiananmen, played in the beginning. Reversed clips from the Swedish Rhapsody numbers station can also be heard. While the player controls their character through the hallways, images may intermittently display, taking up the entire screen and preventing the player from progressing any further until the image automatically closes a few seconds later. Most of the images seem to reference child abuse, especially people indicted in Operation Yewtree, such as images of Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris. Other images revolve around crime, and include people convicted or accused of murder such as Japanese child murderer, cannibal, rapist and necrophile Tsutomu Miyazaki. Included also are photographs of Lady Justice statues, and political figures such as former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Images of accident victims and murder victims are also shown, including the aftermath of a person struck by a truck, and a beheading. Additionally, at least one version of the game contains an image related to the case of Corinne Danielle Motley, a Florida woman who was arrested for producing child pornography, the image being a screencap from a video that led to her arrest. That particular version also contained a virus that caused a wide range of negative effects, from causing the infected computer to become sluggish to a permanent shutdown, once the executable was run. The only other \\"characters\\" in the game are children who simply stand in one place and do not move or interact with the player at all. In the final video posted by Obscure Horror Corner, one of these children does begin to follow the player, causing \\"contact damage\\". Since the player has no means of self-defense or any ability to heal damage, the player will inevitably die at this point in the game.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the journal no longer received state support. In the early 1960s, Sovetish Heymland had a circulation of 25,000, the highest ever circulation for a Yiddish-language periodical. The circulation fell to 16,000 in 1966; to 10,000 in 1971; to 7,000 in 1978; and to 5,000 in 1985.Estraikh, Gennady. \\"Sovetish Heymland.\\" YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe. Although the journal's circulation had fallen dramatically, donations solicited from the United States, France and Argentina in the early 1990s enabled Vergelis to continue publishing the journal under the name Di Yidishe Gas (Yiddish ◊ì◊ô ◊ô◊ô◊ì◊ô◊©◊¢ ◊í◊ê÷∑◊° - \\"The Jewish Street\\") from 1993 until his death in July 1999.Shmeruk, Chone. \\"Twenty-five Years of Sovetish Heymland: Impressions and Criticism,\\" Jewish Culture and Identity in the Soviet Union, ed. Yaacov Ro‚Äôi and Avi Beker, pp. 191‚Äì207, 1991. Sovetish Heymland was developed in the period after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 as a forum for those Yiddish writers who had survived the repressions of Soviet Yiddish which had occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The title referred back to the Moscow-based Yiddish literary periodicals Sovetish (1934‚Äì1941) and Heymland (1947‚Äì1948), indicating a continuity of Yiddish literary output.Chernin, Velvel. \\"Institutionalized Jewish Culture in the 1960s to the mid-1980s,\\" Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union, ed. Yaacov Ro'i, pp. 226-236, 1995. In addition to being the official Yiddish periodical of the Union of Soviet Writers, one of the main aims of the journal was to disseminate Soviet propaganda among Yiddish- speaking Jewish Communists in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. In addition, the publication of a highly literary Yiddish-language journal was meant to show that Yiddish and Yiddish cultural institutions were not disappearing, but that there was in fact a Yiddish revival occurring in the Soviet Union, and that Sovetish Heymland in particular was taking the lead in maintaining Yiddish culture.Moskovich, Wolf. \\"An important event in Soviet Yiddish cultural life: The new Russian‚ÄêYiddish dictionary,\\" Soviet Jewish Affairs, vol. 14 no. 3, pp. 31-49, 1984. As part of this propaganda, Vergelis published numerous anti-Zionist and anti-Israel articles. Vergelis' controversial reputation as a tool of Leonid Brezhnev and the Communist government is based largely on these articles, as well as several articles attacking his critics from outside the Soviet Union. In addition, the fact that Sovetish Heymland was authorized by the government indicated to some that Vergelis was merely a mouthpiece for Soviet propaganda. In addition to literary articles, the journal published materials on Jewish folklore, history, language and literature in Yiddish, the magazine also collected biographical and bibliographical material about Jewish writers. In the 25th anniversary issue of Sovetish Heymland in August 1986, Vergelis announced that the journal had published 76 novels, 109 novellas, 1,478 short stories, 6,680 poems, and 1,628 articles dealing with literary criticism and the arts.Sovetish Heymland, 1986, volume 8. It was also one of the few periodicals to encourage the younger generation of Soviet Yiddish writers.Estraikh, Gennady. \\"Sovetish Heymland: The Journal that Appeared 50 Years Ago.\\" Forverts, July 29, 2011. As the only Yiddish-language journal that was officially allowed by the Soviet authorities from the 1960s through the 1980s, Sovetish Heymland, under the editorship of Vergelis, was connected with almost all of the period's cultural output. Vergelis became an \\"unofficial censor of all Yiddish-language literature and the chief Central Committee consultant on matters relating to Soviet Jews.\\"Chernin, Velvel. \\"Institutionalized Jewish Culture in the 1960s to the mid-1980s,\\" Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union, ed.

Alice Mary Hadfield (14 December 1908 ‚Äì 1989), born Alice Mary Smyth, was a British book editor and author, the co-ordinating editor of the first edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (1941), and the librarian at Oxford University Press's Amen House. She was also the founder, with her husband Charles Hadfield, of the South Cerney Trust in 1963. Early life Hadfield was born Alice Mary Smyth in Cirencester on 14 December 1908. She was educated at Oxford University and Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts. Her first husband, Peter Miller, was killed during the Second World War, near Amiens at the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. After this she went to Bermuda with her baby daughter Laura, where she worked in the British code breaking service. On the journey, her convoy was attacked by U-boats and the ship next to hers was sunk. Second marriage Hadfield's second marriage was to the canal historian Charles Hadfield (1909‚Äì1996), co-founder of the publishers David & Charles, in Paddington in 1945. It was the second marriage for both of them. They lived in London and had two sons, one of whom died when still a baby, a daughter and adopted another son. They were both influenced by the ideas on Romantic Theology developed by Charles Williams who Alice Mary had met when he had been a member of the original committee on the contents of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, and they practiced in their marriage his theories of Co-inherence and the Way of Exchange.Ridler, Anne, \\"Charles Hadfield\\", The Charles Williams Society Newsletter, No. 82. Autumn 1996, pp. 3-6. Career Hadfield replaced Phyllis Jones as librarian at Amen House for Oxford University Press. She was also co-ordinating editor of the first edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (1941). Her first published work was What happens next (A novel), published by Falcon Press in 1950. She wrote on a diverse range of subjects that included British and local history, particularly of her native Cotswolds, produced a number of works with her husband, who was an expert on British canals, and wrote a children's series known as \\"The Williver chronicles\\". She produced an adaption of Sir Thomas Malory's Le morte d'Arthur and a scholarly study of The Chartist Land Company. Her last book was a biographical study of Charles Williams, finished with the help of her husband as her faculties were beginning to fail, and her last work was an edited edition of Williams's Outlines of romantic theology. Societies Hadfield and her husband founded two societies, the South Cerney Trust in 1963, and the Charles Williams Society in 1975. Death Hadfield died in Cirencester in 1989.South Cerney Trust.

After considerable research, scientists and engineers have identified dyes have proven suitable for use for liquid crystal displays. The dyes need adequate lightfastness, suitable wavelength bands, and sufficient order parameter in a liquid crystal host to function as display ingredients. Obtaining dyes with sufficient order parameter in the liquid crystal host has been one of the primary challenges to the adoption of dichroic dyes by industry. Although some dyes exhibit some dichroic qualities, most dyes do not have sufficient dichroic order parameter to function as display ingredients. In order to achieve dyes with sufficient order parameter, researchers have synthesized novel dyes which themselves are liquid crystalline in character to function as display ingredients. The challenges that researchers face are : (1) high purity (2) small quantities and (3) high efficiency. A few companies have overcome these challenges, such as Mitsui Toatsu in Japan and Merck in the U.K. In most cases novel dyes were engineered specifically for use with liquid crystals. The dyes were synthesized from common non-toxic dyes, and substituents with liquid crystalline characteristics were purposely attached to the dyes, not unlike tinker toys. Dichroic dyes differ from electrophoretic charged particle displays, commonly called E-ink. Suitable dyes are available across the visible spectrum, although there are few, if none, green colored dyes with sufficient order parameter for display use. Currently dichroic dyes are used in switchable windows and in some special purpose displays and consumer novelty goods.

Saudi Arabia is a very large country forming the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. It has several geographic regions, each with a diversity of plants and animals adapted to their own particular habitats. As well as high mountains and deserts, there is a coastal plain and long coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the west and a rather shorter coastline on the Persian Gulf to the east. Geography Mount Sawda of the Asir Mountains was thought to be the highest mountain in the country Saudi Arabia has a range of mountains, the Sarawat or Sarat Mountains, which run parallel with the Red Sea coast. These are low at the northern end, have a gap in the middle between Medina and Ta'if, and are higher at the southern end, where Mount Sawda in the Asir Mountains, at just over is the highest point in Saudi Arabia. Between these mountains and the Red Sea is a coastal plain known as Tihamah. The west side of this range is a steep escarpment but to the east is a wide plateau called the Najd which is bounded on the east by a series of mountain ridges, including the ·π¨uwayq Mountains, east of which the land descends gradually to the Persian Gulf. In the south of the country is the Rub' al Khali, or \\"Empty Quarter\\", the largest contiguous sand desert in the world. It slopes from about near the Yemeni border, northwestwards nearly to the Persian Gulf. Another sandy desert, the Nefud, lies in the north central part of Saudi Arabia, and it is connected to the Rub' al Khali by a broad swathe of sand dunes and gravel plains known as Dahna. Most of the country has very little precipitation, less than in many regions, and in the Rub' al Khali there may be no rain for a decade. The mountainous region of Asir in the southwest is wetter; it receives monsoon rains between May and October which may amount to . The northern Ha'il Region has the Shammar Mountains, further divisible into the Aja and Salma subranges. The Red Sea was formed when in the Eocene period, the Arabian Peninsula began to move away from the continent of Africa. This prevented further exchange of genes between African and Arabian species. Furthermore, the late Tertiary and the early Quaternary eras saw a period of climatic cooling that drove vegetation bands southwards, and the Arabian Peninsula received an influx of species from Eurasia. With increasing aridity, conditions became inimical for many of these and they retreated to the damper, southwestern mountainous regions, becoming relict populations. Flora Studying the flora of Saudi Arabia is a daunting task because of the vast size of the kingdom; the general pattern of vegetation is now known but the exact distribution of the many species of flowering plant is poorly understood. Almost 3,500 species of plant have been recorded in the country, with nearly 1,000 species known from the southwestern region of Asir with its higher rainfall. Plants in general are xerophytic and mostly dwarf shrubs or small herbs. There are few species of tree but date palms are abundant in places. Prosopis cineraria grows around the fringes of deserts. The east of Saudi Arabia often receives \\"Mediterranean depressions\\" from November onwards. The arrival of sufficient quantities of rain causes perennial plants to produce new shoots and the seeds of annual plants to germinate. These annuals grow with great rapidity and complete their life cycle within a few weeks. By April or May, the annuals will have flowered, set seeds and died, and the perennials returned to a state of dormancy. In desert areas, plant growth is mostly confined to depressions or wadis, though some plants with deep rooting-systems grow elsewhere. The Rub' al Khali desert has very little plant diversity, with about 37 species of flowering plant having been recorded here, 17 of which are only found around the periphery of the desert. There are virtually no trees, and the plants are adapted for desert life and include dwarf shrubs such as Calligonum crinitum and saltbush, and several species of sedge. Around the margins of this desert are open woodlands with Acacia and Prosopis cineraria. The Asir Mountains in the southwest of the country, and most of the western highlands of Yemen, support a distinct flora which has affinities with parts of East Africa. The highest parts are clothed with cloud forests, southwestern Arabian montane woodlands which includes, on north-facing slopes, Juniperus procera and Euryops arabicus, draped with the lichen Usnea articulata, and on south-facing slopes, dwarf shrubs such as Rubus petitianus, Rosa abyssinica, Alchemilla crytantha, Senecio and Helichrysum abyssinicum, with Aloe sabae and Euphorbia in the driest locations. Lower down, below about , there is evergreen woodland and scrub dominated by Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and Tarchonanthus camphoratus. Below about the vegetation is deciduous scrubland with Acacia, Commiphora, Grewia and succulent plants. In Ha'il Region is located Jabal Aja Protected Area, which is noted for its flora, is located in the area of the Aja Mountains. Fauna Hamadryas baboons in the Hijaz Mountains near Al Hada, Makkah Province, Hejaz The fauna of Saudi Arabia has been better studied than the flora, not least because of interest in the larger mammals for the purpose of hunting and shooting. Birds and butterflies have also been studied, but less is known about other parts of the animal kingdom. Some of the larger mammals found here include the Dromedary camel, the Arabian tahr, the Arabian wolf, the Arabian red fox and fennec, the caracal, the striped hyena, the sand cat, the rock hyrax, and the Cape hare. However habitat destruction, hunting, off-road driving and other human activities have led to the local extinction of the striped hyena, the golden jackal and the honey badger in some localities. The Asir Mountains in the southwest of the country is where the critically endangered Arabian leopard is still to be found, and the broader region is also home to the hamadryas baboon with colonies reaching as far north as Baha, Taif, and the suburbs south of Mecca. The Arabian oryx used to roam over Saudi Arabia's deserts and much of the Middle East but by 1970, it had been hunted to extinction in the wild. However, a captive breeding programme had been initiated at the Phoenix Zoo in the United States in the 1960s and the oryx has since been successfully reintroduced into the wild in the Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in Saudi Arabia, a fenced reserve of over . It is also now present in the 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid protected area, where the goitered gazelle and mountain gazelle are also to be found. The sand cat, which is the only member of the cat family to live exclusively in deserts, can be found in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Its paws are covered with thick hair to protect it from the hot ground, but it is chiefly nocturnal. However, in Najd and Tabuk, the Arabian wolf can be found. It is a solitary hunter and is persecuted by livestock ownerss. Only 2000 to 3000 animals are left in the wild, and accordingly they are considered as ‚Äúendangered‚Äù animals. Birds native to Saudi Arabia include sandgrouse, quails, eagles, buzzards and larks and on the coast, seabirds include pelicans and gulls. The country is also visited by migratory birds in spring and autumn including flamingoes, storks and swallows. MacQueen's bustard is a resident species that is dependent on good vegetation cover, often being found in areas with dense scrubby growth with shrubs such as Capparis spinosa. The cliff faces of the Asir Mountains provide habitat for the griffon vulture, the Verreaux's eagle and the small Barbary falcon, and the juniper woodlands are home to the Yemen linnet, the Yemen thrush, the Yemen warbler and the African paradise flycatcher. The hamerkop nests in the Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, the only place on the Arabian Peninsula at which it is found. =Extinct= The lion, cheetah, and Syrian wild ass used to occur here, as evidenced by Islamic texts. For example, there is a hadith in Muwatta‚Äô Imam Malik about Muslim Pilgrims having to beware of the asad (lion) and fahd (cheetah) in the land, besides other animals.Muwatta‚Äô Imam Malik, Book 20 (Hajj), Hadith 794 The country's last known cheetahs were killed near Ha'il in 1973. The lion reportedly became extinct in the middle of the 19th century. Later on, a 325,000-year-old tusk of an extinct type of elephants known as Palaeoloxodon was found in An Nafud desert in northwestern Saudi Arabia, in addition to remains of an extinct jaguar, oryx and a member of the horse family. In 2020, footprints of camels, buffalo, elephants and other species were found near a shallow lake in Tabuk Province, dated back 120,000 years ago.

They formed in 2013 with lead singer Shlomo Gaisin and guitarist Zachariah Goldschmiedt. The band, named after Zusha of Hanipol, combines traditional Hasidic niggunim with secular styles like jazz, folk, and reggae. Their self- titled debut EP, released on October 28, 2014, reached No. 9 on Billboard's World Albums chart, while their debut full-length album, Kavana (2016), reached No. 2. History =Origins (2013-2014)= Zusha was formed in 2013 by Shlomo Gaisin, Zachariah Goldschmiedt, and Elisha Mlotek. All three had prior music backgrounds: Gaisin was the lead singer of the Jewish rock band JudaBlue, Goldschmiedt was the lead singer and producer for the electro-funk band Ch!nch!lla, and Mlotek is the son of Folksbiene director Zalmen Mlotek and grandson of Yiddish musicologist Eleanor Mlotek. Gaisin and Mlotek met at a Chabad house in Bowery, and both were later introduced to Goldschmiedt through a mutual friend. They began rehearsing in friends' apartments, recording their sessions via iPhone, until Dani Bronstein, their current manager and Rabbi Avram Mlotek, Elisha Mlotek's brother, encouraged them to share their music more publicly. =Zusha EP (2014-2016)= Zusha's self- titled debut EP was recorded and produced by Mason Jar Music and released on October 28, 2014, two days after the band's first show at the Mercury Lounge with Levi Robin. The EP subsequently reached No. 9 on Billboard's World Albums chart. In December, they performed at the Knitting Factory and opened for Soulfarm at the Highline Ballroom. The EP features cover art by Hasidic expressionist artist, Chezi Gerin. In 2015, they gave a Purim concert with G-Nome Project at the Bowery Ballroom and a Havdalah concert at the Atlanta Jewish Academy. They also performed at the Kulturfest Yiddish Soul concert at Central Park's Rumsey Playfield, alongside Hasidic pop stars Avraham Fried and Lipa Schmeltzer, cantors Joseph Malovany and Yaakov Lemmer, and klezmer trumpeter Frank London. In May, they played at the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center as part of the Washington Jewish Music Festival. =Kavana (2016-present)= The band's first full-length album, Kavana, was released on January 5, 2016, and subsequently reached No. 2 on Billboard's World Albums chart. A music video was filmed for the song \\"Mashiach\\". The album's song \\"Pashut\\" was featured in the trailer for the 2017 film Menashe, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. = A Colorful World (2017) = A Colorful World, Zusha‚Äôs second full album, was released on September 4, 2017. Unlike their previous albums, most songs on A Colorful World feature Hebrew lyrics of some sort, whether biblical (such as Mizmor) or more modern (like Hatikva). = When the Sea Split (2019) = Zusha‚Äôs third full album, When the Sea Split, released on September 1, 2019. The album marked Elisha Mlotek‚Äôs departure from the band. Musical style Zusha's music combines the wordless vocals and improvised nature of traditional nigunim with elements folk, jazz, soul, reggae, and ska. Influences cited by the band include Shlomo Carlebach, Matisyahu, Bob Dylan, Damian Marley, and Yosi Piamenta. =Hasidic influence= The band is often associated with the Hasidic hipster and neo- Hasidism movements, although they have debated the latter term, arguing that they are merely rediscovering Hasidism rather than reinventing it. They have also rejected the label of being \\"Jewish music\\", with Mlotek saying, \\"The music is deeper than religion. It‚Äôs deeper than a faith. I‚Äôm Jewish, but I‚Äôm a person.

It has an elevation of above sea level. The hill has a flat plateau at the top, but steep slopes on its northern, western, and southern sides. The western and southern parts of the hill have some residential development, while the northern side is mostly forested. The views it provides of the surrounding area have been described as \\"striking\\" and \\"breathtaking\\". Geography Turkey Hill has an elevation of above sea level. It is mainly situated within Bloomsburg and Scott Township; its highest point is in Scott Township. The hill is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Bloomsburg. It has a topographic prominence of approximately . The hill is part of a larger geographic formation known as Montour Ridge, which begins as a moderately sized hill west of Berwick and runs west, eventually becoming a mountain. In Walter M. Brasch's 1982 book Columbia County Place Names, Turkey Hill is described as being a large hill. However, a number of housing developments and streets have been constructed on the hill, making parts of it difficult to recognize as a hill. The hill is bordered by Fishing Creek on two sides. Turkey Hill is topped by a relatively flat plateau. However, there are steep slopes on the southern, northern, and western sides of the hill. The Turkey Hill Anticline passes through Turkey Hill in a west-southwest to east-northeast direction, heading towards the Berwick area. There are areas with slopes of 25 percent or higher in the vicinity of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. The area in the vicinity of the oxbow contains the floodplain of the former course of Fishing Creek. Geology The bedrock geology in the highest elevations of Turkey Hill consists of the Upper Member of the Rose Hill Formation, which dates to the Middle Silurian. This rock formation consists of sandstone, limestone, and shale and ranges in color from a light olive gray to a medium gray. This formation is thick. The Center Member of the Rose Hill Formation occurs on a few lower-elevation areas in the vicinity of the hill. It also dates to the Middle Silurian and contains gray- red-purple to dusky red hematitic sandstone that is interbedded with silty clay shale. This formation is thick. The Lower Member of the Rose Hill Formation occurs on the westernmost extremity of the hill. The Keefer Formation and the Mifflintown Formation also common on the hill, but at lower elevations than the Lower Member of the Rose Hill Formation. They also date to the Middle Silurian. History Turkey Hill was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1189936. The earliest names by which Turkey Hill was referred to are no longer known. The hill probably received its current name in the late 19th century from a large turkey farm nearby. In the 19th century, a school/geographical district in the northwestern part of Scott Township was named Turkey Hill District after Turkey Hill. In the late 1960s, the Bloomsburg State College (now Bloomsburg University) constructed an upper campus on Turkey Hill. In addition to this, several farms, including a flower plantation, were in business on the hill as late as the 1970s. Housing developments have also been present on the southern and western parts of the hill since at least the 1970s. In a 1974 report, the plateau at the top of Turkey Hill was said to be one of the most developable area in Bloomsburg. Turkey Hill has been said to provide a \\"striking view\\" of part of the Susquehanna River valley. Views from hillside neighborhoods in the area have been described as \\"breathtaking\\". However, a 1974 report noted that the poor layout of streets in the area leads to accessibility and safety problems. Biology Turkey Hill possesses some forested slopes; nearly all of the northern side of the hill is forested. Between these forested slopes and Interstate 80 lies an oxbow lake of Fishing Creek, known as the Turkey Hill Oxbow. On the nearby slopes, there is a forest of hemlock and hardwood trees. There are also several skunk cabbage seeps on the slope. Near the oxbow, there are forested wetlands, shrub swamps, graminoid openings, and areas of open water.

History Heedoosh was founded by brothers Yaniv and Yahav Tsaidi, who were born in Israel but grew up in Detroit with Yemenite-Moroccan parents. Yaniv began his career as a Hasidic pop singer in Chicago, recording two solo albums and performing on the 2004 Am Yisrael Chai tour alongside Reva L'Sheva and Adi Ran; eventually, however, he decided to take his music in a rock direction. The Tsaidis formed Heedoosh in New York City in 2005, collaborating with Brooklyn-based producer/guitarist Eli Massias and drummer Ari Leichtberg. That same year, they performed at the Triad Theater, played the Jewish music festival Yidstock at Monticello Raceway, and opened for Badfish. Their debut album, Meumkah Delibah, was released on May 9, 2006. Ben Jacobson of The Jerusalem Post listed it as the number one Jewish album of the year, describing the songs \\"Etz Hayim,\\" \\"Lev Tahor,\\" \\"Bein Mayim L'Yayin\\" and \\"The Purim Song\\" as \\"among the greatest rock songs ever to focus on Jewish themes.\\" After a brief hiatus, the band returned in December and performed at New York's Lion's Den alongside Hamakor.

She was acknowledged as his collaborator when he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry and she published seven volumes of his works after his death. She was awarded the Grand Order of the Latvian Academy of Sciences Medal for her contributions to the furtherance of science. Biography Magda Voita (also shown as ()) was born on 17 August 1902 in Elva, Estonia to the Latvian physician Oskars Voits. As a child, she lived in Saint Petersburg, later traveled extensively throughout Germany, Hungary and Switzerland and gained fluency in English, French, German and Russian. She was also an accomplished pianist and violinist. She settled in Germany for her university studies at the University of Berlin. She studied plants under Gottlieb Haberlandt and obtained a degree in natural sciences in 1925. She then continued her studies at the University of Latvia in Riga under Nikolajs Malta until 1927, when she earned her PhD. That year, Voita married Hermann Staudinger, who would later win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and moved with him to take up a position at Freiburg University in Germany. She met Hermann after she had passed her Latvian state examination and was studying at the Biological Institute on Helgoland in the summer of 1927. Hermann had recently published results on cellulose models and Voita was working on algae cell membranes. From that point on, they began collaborating on macromolecules. Staudinger studied macromolecules and their chemical structure and collaborated with Hermann for many years. In the 1940s she returned to applying macromolecule studies to biology, conducting trials from 1945 forward on living cells. In 1946, Hermann founded a journal to focus on developments in macromolecular chemistry, Makromolekulare Chemie, and Staudinger served on the editorial board of the journal. When Hermann received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he acknowledged Staudinger's collaboration in his research. Between 1937 and 1956, she published 30 scientific papers on molecular mass and the microscopic evaluations of fiber morphology and colloids. Between 1969 and 1976, Staudinger edited and published seven volumes of the collected works of her husband. After Hermann's death in 1965, she became president of the International Federation of University Women, serving until 1968. She strove for more recognition of women in science and joined UNESCO to further those aims in the 1970s acting as president of the UNESCO German Science Commission from 1970 to 1975. She also was the first coordinator of the UNESCO Biosphere program. In 1990, she was made an honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences and in 1991 she established a fund to assist those studying biology, chemistry and medicine in Latvia. In 1995, Staudinger set up a trust, the Magda and Hermann Staudinger Fund, for the benefit of retired members of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, to be used at the discretion of the academy for scholarships or other compensation. In 1996, she was awarded the Grand Order of the Latvian Academy of Sciences Medal.

He was primarily responsible for negotiating the return payment by the US of its share of the Boxer Indemnity for the establishment of Tsinghua University and the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. Early life in the United States 1881 Phillips Academy baseball team. Liang is sitting in the front row on the far right. Liang was born in Panyu, Guangdong Province. At the age of 12, he was sent to study in the United States as part of the Chinese Educational Mission. He studied at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, but returned to China in 1881 when the program was canceled. One of the reasons for the cancellation of the mission was that the students were adopting too many American customs, and Liang was no exception. While at Phillips, he became a star baseball player for the school, most famously in a game against Phillips Exeter Academy in 1881, where he batted in three runs with two extra base hits. Diplomatic career =Early career= After returning to China, Liang joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Beginning in 1885, he followed Zhang Yinhuan and served in the Chinese embassy to the United States, Spain, and Peru (one embassy served all three countries). He, along with Zhang, also participated in the negotiations for the Treaty of Shimonoseki, following China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1897, again as part of Zhang's legation, he was in London for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee (60th anniversary of her accession to the British throne), and was named an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. It was at this time that he placed his courtesy name ahead of his given name and became knighted as Sir Chentung Liang Cheng. During the Boxer Rebellion, Liang accompanied Prince Chun to Germany where the latter was to personally apologize to Kaiser for the murder of Baron Clemens von Ketteler. The Kaiser wanted to have the Prince kowtow before him as a form of humiliation, but Liang was able to negotiate a compromise and the Prince merely bowed before the Kaiser in a private audience. =Ambassador to the United States= On July 19, 1902, Liang was appointed the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Spain, and Peru (this later was changed to ambassador to the United States and Mexico, and in late 1903, to just the United States), replacing Wu Tingfang. Shortly after assuming his post, Liang met with President Theodore Roosevelt, who asked him about his Phillips Academy days. As the story goes, Roosevelt asked who Liang thought was the best player on the team. Forgoing the usual Chinese cultural habit of modesty, Liang replied that he was. \\"From that moment the relations between President Roosevelt and myself became ten-fold stronger and closer,\\" said Liang. The Boxer Protocol signed at the conclusion of the Boxer Rebellion specified that China was to pay war reparations to the Eight-Nation Alliance in silver, but seven of the countries demanded payment in gold instead. The United States was amenable to silver, but changed its mind in order to preserve unanimity with the rest of the alliance. During those discussions in early 1905, US Secretary of State John Hay had mentioned to Liang that he felt the amount of the indemnity to be paid was too high, and Liang saw an opportunity to have the US return some of that money. Negotiations were initially successful, except that China did not want to reveal what it would do with the returned funds. The US was wary of political corruption and demanded that the funds would be used in \\"establishing educational institutions and financing foreign study\\". The Minister of Foreign Affairs Yuan Shikai put forth a counter-proposal that would allocate the money to building roads instead, but the Qing government did not want to present it for fear that the US would want to \\"interfere out of suspicion\\" later. However, the refund of the indemnity did not take place until two years later. Various hurdles, such as Hay's death, mistreatment of Chinese Americans, and the killing of the missionary Eleanor Chestnut in Lianzhou, all caused delays. Furthermore, public opinion in the US was against refunding, and Hay's successor Elihu Root, despite previously being \\"sympathetic\\" toward China, now reversed course. Liang decided to approach Commerce Secretary Oscar S. Straus and Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield. In April 1907 those two then asked Roosevelt to recheck the actual expenditures of the US Army in China. Thanks to Liang's friendly relationship with Roosevelt, the President agreed to the request. Meanwhile, Yuan had learned that his counter-proposal was never put forth to the US, and as a result, was displeased with Liang who had initiated and advocated the use of the funds towards education. In April or May, the Foreign Ministry recalled Liang to Beijing, but Liang was able to forestall this from happening. Finally on June 15, Liang was informed that the US would indeed repay a portion of its share of the indemnity (this was later increased to 50% of the final payment, and eventually in 1924 to 100%). His negotiations concluded, Liang returned to China; his replacement was the man he succeeded, Wu Tingfang. The monies that Liang negotiated were used to establish Tsinghua University in Beijing and to fund the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. =Later career= Upon his return to China, he served as the director of the Guangdong‚ÄìHankou Railway, President of the Board of Foreign Affairs, and Comptroller General of Maritime Customs at Beijing. In 1909, he accompanied Prince Rui as a member of the Chinese Imperial Naval Commission to study the navies of western nations. In 1910‚Äì11, he became the Chinese Minister to Berlin, and during that time was conferred the Order of the Red Eagle, 1st Class. His final assignment was as China's representative to the International Opium Convention at The Hague in 1912. When the Qing dynasty fell, he retired to Huangpu village in Guangdong, and then later to Hong Kong, where he died in 1917. Family Liang was married three times to women whose names are not recorded, except that one had the surname Huang (ÈªÑ). His first wife died before he became the ambassador to the United States, and bore him ten children. From his second marriage, he had another son, for a total of eleven children.

Founded in 2011, the label focused on printing and distributing Florida-based electronic and experimental music. It then became an artist cooperative. The cooperative structure accommodates a fluctuating number of member-owners: twenty to thirty individuals who operate the company's marketing, video, live production, A&R;, and sales departments. The label is known in the region for its live production consisting of site-specific art installations that serve as immersive performance environments for its artists.  History  = Formation = Elestial Sound began as an amalgamation of the many elements and people involved in the North Florida music scene. An art studio in Gainesville, FL called The Church of Holy Colors, run by Evan Galbicka and collaborators Joey Fillastre and Felici Asteinza, became a nexus for many of the future Elestial Sound members and served as a DIY venue space for the thriving experimental and electronic music scene in the region. The fusion of art installation and musical performance by the community of artists and musicians in the area helped shape the aesthetic and direction of the label in the following years. = Early years = Established in September 2011 by Gabriel Ortiz, the label celebrated its first two releases with an artist showcase in their hometown of Gainesville, FL. In December 2011, Ortiz partnered with Davis Hart, a native to the Florida music scene. As a result, the company expanded its vision to include comprehensive artist development and support, providing in-house marketing, video production, and tour support with waste vegetable oil-powered buses. Within the first three months of 2012, Hundred Waters‚Äô debut album was released and two touring buses were converted to run on vegetable oil, providing support to bands Jane Jane Pollock, Levek and Hundred Waters on nationwide tours. During these initial tours, Elestial Sound simultaneously curated showcases at South by Southwest and Florida-based festival Total Bummer 3D featuring headliners Prince Rama and Hundred Waters. In May 2012, Hart acquired a warehouse in Gainesville which served as a venue for the label and multipurpose workshop for stage construction and bus maintenance. The Elestial Sound Headquarters would go on to host a number of label showcases throughout 2013 and 2014, featuring Hundred Waters, Quintron and Miss Pussycat, Levek, Jane Jane Pollock, The Dewars, MSNRA, Ghost Fields, Euglossine and others. These early shows in their own space helped build a reputation for the label in Gainesville as a live production company capable of combining fine art and live music into a cohesive experience. = Transition to cooperative structure = In late 2013, Ortiz and Hart decided to restructure the company into a cooperative. Without any real precedent for a cooperative record label, Hart took ideas from producer and worker cooperatives in the grocery industry to write the company's bylaws. Since 2013, the cooperative has continued to release records, provide artist development and construct site-specific art installations around the Southeast. The cooperative consists of a fluctuating cast of worker and producer member-owners. A board of directors guides the label in its artist selection and financial decisions and its worker owners carry out the company's day-to-day logistics. The cooperative uses a dynamic equity split system in which the owners earn equity in the company based on their individual contributions to the cooperative. In July 2014, a new property was acquired in order to construct a recording studio and house the different departments of the company. Renovations began shortly after the acquisition and the facility is expected to be fully operational by 2017.

Parsons developed an interest in biochemistry and nutrition at the University of Wisconsin-Madision, where she was a graduate student under Elmer McCollum. Parsons spent most of her own scientific career at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in their Home Economics department. After her retirement, she was named a fellow of the American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) in 1959, one of only three women to be so honored. Parsons is well known for her early work on eggs, which was critical to the discovery of biotin and avidin in 1940. Her later work on thiamine depletion by live yeast was crucial in helping to stop the sale of raw yeast cocktails as a nutritional supplement. Early life and education Helen Tracy Parsons was born on March 26, 1886 in Arkansas City, Kansas. Her father was a physician who came from a pioneer family in Indiana and her mother was born at a mission house to Mohegan Native Americans in New England. Both her mother's and father's family believed in education and encouraged scholarly thinking for her and her sister. At five years old Parsons began attending the second ward school in Arkansas City, where her aunt was the principal. She moved with her aunt and uncle to Alabama, where she attended a co-ed military high school. Parsons returned to Arkansas City at age sixteen to teach at a country school. After several years of teaching, Parsons left the school to attend summer session at a teachers‚Äô college in Pittsburg, Kansas. It was here that she was first introduced to the budding field of home economics and decided to enroll at Kansas State Agricultural College in 1911. While in college, Parsons was introduced to chemistry and physiology through home economics classes. She described the \\"enriching [combination] of home economics with science\\" as \\"a very potent thing\\" and switched from wanting to become a Latin teacher to wanting to pursue both home economics and science.  Graduate education and early research  After another brief teaching job in Oklahoma, Parsons met Abby Marlatt, head of the Home Economics department at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, at a dinner party in 1913. Marlatt offered her an assistant job at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where Parsons was intended to be the ‚Äúbridge between science and home economics‚Äù. Parsons matriculated in the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1913 where she began taking biochemistry classes with Elmer McCollum, who at the time was doing original work on vitamins A and B. Parsons credits McCollum with teaching her how to do research, describing him as ‚Äúa very sympathetic teacher‚Äù and ‚Äúvery patient with [her] not knowing anything at all‚Äù. Parsons began pursuing her master's degree under McCollum and received one in 1916 at age 20. Published in 1918, her thesis helped show that the dietary properties of the potato closely resemble those of cereal grains. In 1917, McCollum moved to head the biochemistry department at the newly established Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, where Parsons chose to follow. Working in McCollum's lab, Parsons had access to the nation's first colony of white rats for use in nutrition experiments. At Johns Hopkins, Parsons worked with McCollum on many topics pertaining to vitamins, and published her own early study on vitamin C metabolism in rats. At the time, vitamin C had not yet been isolated or chemically identified. However, Parsons had noticed that humans and other primates required an anti-scurvy, or anti-scorbutic, supplement to their diet while rats did not. By putting rats on an anti-scorbutic diet and then feeding their livers to guinea pigs suffering from scurvy, Parsons found that the diet cured guinea pigs of their scurvy, suggesting that there was an anti-scorbutic substance, which we now know as vitamin C, that was synthesized in the rats‚Äô livers. After three years at Johns Hopkins, Parsons was offered a faculty position as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and she returned to the department of Home Economics in 1920. During this time and until after the late 1920s, the department of Home Economics was not allowed to have Ph.D. candidates. According to Parsons, the Home Economics department was seen as more of a trade school, one where \\"people did cooking and sewing\\", and the administration did not want the University \\"smirched with a trade school reproach\\". Accordingly, Parsons was forced to pursue her Ph.D. elsewhere.  Doctoral studies  Around 1927, Parsons went to obtain her Ph.D. under the direction of Lafayette Mendel, a biochemical nutritionist working out of the Yale Physiological Chemistry Laboratory. In Parsons‚Äô second year there, she was awarded the Mary Pemberton Nourse Fellowship from the American Association of University Women. Her thesis involved studying the effect of high protein diets on reproduction and kidney function in rats. She found that when fed powdered or raw egg white, rats developed dermatitis and neurological dysfunction. She would take these results back with her to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and continue her research on what she termed ‚Äúegg white injury‚Äù in her own lab. Her work on this topic later proved crucial in helping to identify biotin and avidin. Parsons‚Äô graduated with her doctoral degree from Yale in 1928 at the age of 42, after which she returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an associate professor.  University of Wisconsin-Madison  Parsons returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1928 as an associate professor with an annual salary of $3600 and research funding from the university for her own laboratory. There, she was able to expand work done during her doctoral period and perform experiments critical to the discovery of biotin and avidin, as well thiamine depletion by yeast. = Studies in egg white injury and biotin = Parsons had noticed during her time at Yale that rats fed only raw egg-white as their protein diet developed unfavorable physiological effects such as severe dermatitis and neurological dysfunction. If kept on the diet, the rats invariably died after a short period of time. Parsons hypothesized that there was an 'anti-vitamin' in the egg-white (later discovered to be avidin) that was abstracting and binding a key nutrient (later discovered to be biotin) in the rats digestive tract, giving rise to these adverse symptoms. A series of further experiments in 1933 proved that the anti-vitamin responsible for egg white injury was a protein that could be destroyed during peptic digestion or through exposure to hydrochloric acid. Parsons and her group then went on to look for foods that could counteract the symptoms of egg-white injury. They found that foods like cooked kidney, cooked liver, yeast, egg yolk, or dried milk contained a 'protective factor' (later found to be biotin) that cured the rats dermatitis and prevented the debilitating effects of egg-white consumption. They went on to partially purify the factor and showed that the amount needed to cure symptoms was proportional to the amount of egg-white fed. Although ultimately unable to chemically identify the protective factor, Parsons' early work on the subject was crucial to the later identification of biotin by Paul Gyorgy in 1940. In a 1959 letter to Parsons, Gyorgy wrote: > \\"It was you, my dear Doctor Parsons, who gave me the best stimulus to > unravel the difficult problem of egg-white toxicity and biotin deficiency. > Your excellent and classical experiments on the identification of bound > biotin in the feces of rats fed raw egg-white opened the way to solve the > puzzle of egg-white toxicity. I am still grateful to you for giving us the > light to see the things in proper perspective.\\" At the time, Parsons' egg-white results were controversial within the egg and poultry industry. She recalls being \\"insulted at the time any of [her] reports\\" were given at meetings and her results were often called into question by those involved with the industries. = Thiamine depletion by yeast = Parsons' later career revolved around thiamine depletion by live yeast. In the late 1930s and 1940s, it was popular to drink live yeast cocktails. Many yeast companies marketed the mixtures as a good source of nutrients and proteins. However, after talking with her colleagues, Parsons began to question validity of the cocktails. She began her own experiments into the matter after receiving funding from a yeast company in Milwaukee to try and prove the nutritional benefits of live yeast. She began feeding live yeast to human subjects on a diet rich in thiamine and found that live yeast cocktails sharply decreased the amount of urinary thiamine in subjects. In contrast, dead, boiled yeast had no effect on thiamine levels. Parsons' also found that live yeast recovered from subjects' feces had large amounts of stored thiamine, indicating that thiamine depletion was caused by a withholding process by the viable yeast and not from destruction within the digestive system. Thiamine stores were quickly regained by stopping the consumption of live yeast. Although the yeast company she was working for was not happy with the results, they allowed Parsons to publish her findings. Some of her colleagues were not as fortunate - in her oral history Parsons recalls some of their research being suppressed by the larger yeast companies and their papers cancelled for publication. During her work with yeast, Parsons had extensive communication with the companies involved in selling yeast, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorities who were responsible for the regulation in the sale of nutritional supplements. Her research sparked a fierce debate over nutrition and yeast, culminating in a threatened lawsuit by the FDA against the yeast companies and the banning of advertisements for yeast cocktails.  Later years  Parsons retired from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1956 at the age of 70. She remained active in the American Institute of Nutrition, the American Society of Biological Chemists, the American Dietetics Association, and the American Home Economics Association. She was 1 of 112 charter members of the American Institute of Nutrition (now known as the American Society for Nutrition), which was the first scientific society dedicated solely to the discipline of nutrition and in 1959, was one of three women to be named a fellow of the society.

It can be described as music that \\"takes the ecstatic drops of dubstep or trap, but provides a warm bounce rather than a lumbering bruteness. Basslines are provided by harsh, detuned synths that buzz and purr instead of gulp and whomp.\\" The genre was pioneered by producers such as Flume, Lido and Cashmere Cat, and it was popularised in the mid-2010s by artists such as Louis the Child, Marshmello and Mura Masa. 2016 was seen as the breakout year for the genre.  History  The genre was pioneered by Scottish producers Rustie and Hudson Mohawke and American producer RL Grime, who began producing future bass tracks in 2010. One of the first popularity-fueling releases in the genre was Rustie's album Glass Swords, released in 2011. Later, in 2013, the Flume remix for Disclosure's song You & Me brought the genre into the mainstream, and through the mid-2010s future bass became popular in the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China, Korea and Australia.  Characteristics  The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter), or the wave's amplitude, to adjust the waveform (to create a ‚Äòwobbly‚Äô effect on its parameters). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat \\"twinkly\\"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during \\"risers\\" (gradual pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops, or vocoders.  Subgenres  = Kawaii future bass = Kawaii future bass (also known simply as kawaii bass) is a subgenre of future bass, known for its happy and cute timbre and strong Japanese pop culture influences. Often, chiptune sounds, soft square waves, samples from anime or video games, percussion instruments, and door and bed squeaks are incorporated into such songs. Snail's House and other producers have produced tracks of this subgenre, with the former being credited as the genre pioneer after releasing an album in 2015.

Translated by Stefani Hoffman. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1979. Shortly after meeting, Nathan Sharansky's exit visa was denied, and he became an active refusenik. Natalia applied for a visa to Israel, and the couple began to discuss marriage. They married in 1974, one day and a half before Natalia's exit visa expired. The day after their wedding, Natalia left for Israel while Nathan remained in the Soviet Union. He was imprisoned in 1977 on charges of high treason. In Israel, Natalia changed her name to Avital and began to campaign for her husband's release. In the fall of 1975, she made her first trip to the United States and Canada with the help of activists from the Union of Councils. During this time, she met with members of Congress. In 1978, Nathan was sentenced to 13 years of forced labor. The reaction catapulted the Sharanskys into the spotlight as figures of the Soviet Jewry Movement.

The general of the Jodhpur army, Bhimraj Bakshi fled the battlefield with his horsemen before the battle started but the local Rathore chieftains refused to retreat without a fight.Fall of the Mughal Empire: 1789‚Äì1803, Jadunath Sarkar, p 26 Background After the Battle of Patan, Scindia had demanded Jodhpur to pay tribute and surrender the district of Ajmer, the raja of Jodhpur was ready to pay tribute but the surrender of Ajmer was something that he was reluctant to do as Ajmer was a strategic city located in the centre of Rajasthan. War became inevitable as Scindia was not ready to negotiate and sent his army under his trusted general Benoit De Boigne to invade Marwar and bring Vijay Singh to terms. The Jodhpur raja asked all of his Rathor warriors aged between 16-70 years to join him in the protection of Marwar. Unlike the other Rajput states, the Rathors of Marwar still fought with lances and swords and despised guns. The Jodhpur infantry was also ill equipped and had no discipline, the soldiers were mostly irregulars, few of them had matchlocks and the rest were armed with swords and spears. The Scindia army had reformed its infantry under the command of the savoyan adventurer Benoit de Boigne by raising the Campoos brigades. Benoit's Campoo infantry was made up of Rajputs and Muslims from north India, he had also equipped his soldiers with french muskets and artillery, making them a dominant force. The Scindia Cavalry was commanded by Gopal Bhau and he was assisted by the Holkar cavalry under the command of Bapu Rao, Kashi Rao and Ali Bahadur.Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 4, By Jadunath Sarkar pg23-25 The Maratha army under Boigne force marched towards Merta but their artillery got trapped in the river Luni. Some of the Jodhpur generals wanted to attack the Marathas at this point but Bakshi denied this proposal, this allowed the Marathas to dig their artillery out of the river. Unlike Bakshi, Boigne wanted to attack as soon as possible because of the limited supplies and the heat of the desert. There was a threat of reinforcements from the other Rajput states as well and Boigne wanted to make sure that he isolates the Jodhpur army. De Boigne silently led his men 2 hours before daybreak and made his attack on the Jodhpur infantry.Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 4, By Jadunath Sarkar pg26 Battle General Boigne took the Jodhpur army by surprise \\"some were brushing their teeth with chewed twigs, some bathing in tanks, and some still in bed\\" he attacked the right wing of the Jodhpur line and forced the Jodhpuri infantry to retreat after some gun fire on both sides. Boigne captured all of the Jodhpuri artillery through this skirmish and routed the enemy infantry. The Jodhpur general Bhimraj Bakshi upon seeing his men flee lost all hope and fled with his horsemen. The local Rathore chieftains however held their position and started rallying their clansmen. The Rathors charged at Boignes right wing which was commanded by Captain Rohan, who had become confident upon seeing the fleeing enemy. The Rathors killed nearly half of Rohan's men and went through the gap to attack Boignes main army. However Boigne formed a hollow square and repulsed all efforts of the Rathors. The Rathors upon finding it impossible to break through the square turned back and went around the square to attack Sindhia's cavalry that stood behind the Campoo infantry. The deccan cavalry which was stationary at that time was unable to face the charge of the Rathors and fled at first shock. Holkars cavalry however resisted the charge and a bloody hand to hand fight started between the two forces and lasted for almost 2 hours, by this time both the Sindhias and Boigne had rallied back and joined the Holkars, they slowly surrounded the Rathors and pushed them back. The Rathors were now spent, Boigne took this chance to direct his guns at the Rathors and shot them down in great numbers. The main bulk of the Rathor army had now retreated to the Merta fort but the Zard Kaprawalas, the Rathors who swear to fight to their last breath, now started preparing for a suicide charge to protect their clans honour. Boigne directed his guns and shot them at close range, killing most of the Rathors. The few who survived the cannon and musket fire charged Boignes' infantry and were killed after a short but brave fight. According to Jadunath Sarkar, \\"not a house of note among the Rathor clan but mourned the death of its head\\".Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 4, By Jadunath Sarkar pg.27-29 A French mercenary Beno√Æt de Boigne gives an eyewitness's account of a charge that took place: \\"it is impossible for me to describe the feats of bravery performed by the Zard-Kaprawalas or forlorn hope of the enemy. I have seen, after their line was broken, fifteen or twenty men only return to charge one thousand infantry, and advance within ten or fifteen paces of our line, before they were all shot.\\" \\"It is but just to the enemy to acknowledge that, considering the situation in which they were found, and the disorder consequent thereto, they behaved very valiantly, as they actually cut down some of our people at their guns, and two of them with a desperate fury and intrepidity, made at De Boigne himself and might possibly have killed him if they had not been hewn in pieces by his bodyguards.\\"Fall of the Mughal Empire: 1789‚Äì1803, Jadunath Sarkar, p 29 Aftermath Boigne besieged the Merta fort, the Rathors inside sued for peace when Boigne threatened to bombard it. Boigne allowed the Rathors to empty the fort and leave with their arms. Merta was then plundered for 3 days, the loot was ample although less than Patan, Opium worth rs. 50,000 was also found. After the battle, Vijay singh accepted the terms of Mahadji Scindia, he gave the Scindias the rich province of Ajmer and millions of rupees. The Rathors had been effectively weakened as most of their elite warriors and nobles had perished in battle. De Boigne was given a gun salute of hundreds of cannon shots and his pay and jagir (Land grant) were both increased.The State at War in South Asia, By Pradeep Barua pg 97 References Sources  Patan Patan 1790 in India Patan History of Rajasthan ","title":"Battle of Merta"},{"id":"48624650","text":"George Washington Burnap (November 30, 1802 in Merrimack, New Hampshire - September 8, 1859 in Philadelphia) was a Unitarian clergyman of the United States. Biography His father was a Congregational minister in Merrimack. His mother died when he was seven, and a sister took care of him. He graduated from Harvard College in 1824, and then studied for three years at Harvard Divinity School. His studies of the Bible in college convinced him to become a Unitarian. In 1828 he was ordained pastor of the First Independent Church in Baltimore, where Jared Sparks had preceded him, and which position he retained till his death. He married Nancy Williams in 1831. Without neglecting his pastoral duties, Burnap devoted much of his career to studies, mostly oriented toward explaining Unitarianism to the public and justifying its doctrines in the face of its critics. In 1849 he received the degree of D.D. from Harvard College. Works He was a voluminous writer, chiefly on theoloogical and controversial subjects. His principal works are: * Lectures on the Doctrines in Controversy between Unitarians and other Denominations of Christians (1835) * Lectures on the History of Christianity (1842) * Expository Lectures on the principal Texts of the Bible which relate to the Doctrine of the Trinity (1845) * Lectures to Young Men on the Cultivation of the Mind, &c.; (1848) * Lectures on the Sphere and Duties of Woman (1849) * Lectures on the Doctrines of Christianity (1850) * Christianity, its Essence and Evidence (1855) * a life of Leonard Calvert, the first governor of Maryland, in Sparks's American Biography.

The Tiger has a smaller companion, The Cub, who wears shorts, oversized sneakers, and a jersey numbered . History Clemson's athletic teams have been nicknamed the Tigers since 1896, when coach (and later university president) Walter Merritt Riggs brought the name from his alma mater, Auburn University. The school's first costumed mascot was the Southern Gentleman, a student dressed in a purple formal suit with a top hat and cane. The name came from a Greenville News editor's nickname for Clemson students, and was discontinued in 1972. The first costumed tiger mascot appeared in 1954. A smaller, ostensibly younger, companion named The Cub was introduced in 1993. The Tiger's wide, yellow eyes are perceived by some as frightening. In 2014, CBSSports.com named The Tiger #4 on its list of ten scariest college football mascots. Traditions In 1978, mascot Zach Mills began the tradition of doing a number push-ups after every score equal to the number of points Clemson had in the game. Mills performed 287 push-ups in that game, a record that was later eclipsed by Ricky Capps, who performed 465 push-ups(including help from the Wake Demon Deacon) in an 82‚Äì24 victory over Wake Forest during the 1981 national championship season.

It is the second instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the Battle of Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II and revolves around the United States Marine Corps' objective to secure the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army. The game is a turn-based strategy and focuses on the player using their units to attack Japanese forces in order to capture the island. The player assumes control of the Marine Corps and must eliminate all Japanese forces by ground, air, or naval combat. The game received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the game's value for money and easy difficulty for novice gamers; however, many criticised the graphics and mechanics. Gameplay A map showing the land battles on Iwo Jima. Red sprites represent Japanese forces while black sprites show American positions The game is a turn-based strategy focuses on the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands as part of the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits. At the beginning of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will be given the opportunity to shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game. Background Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry, England, by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981. The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts, such as Theatre Europe, Bismark and Falklands '82. The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique, and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom. In 1986, Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16-bit consoles, as he found that smaller 8-bit consoles such as the ZX Spectrum lacked the processing power for larger strategy games. The decision was falsely interpreted as \\"pulling out\\" from the Spectrum market by video game journalist Phillipa Irving. Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, in what Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that \\"he took his eye off the ball\\". The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987, and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt. Reception The game received mixed reviews form critics upon release. Both Gwyn Hughes of Your Sinclair and a reviewer of ZX Computing praised the game's value for money and heralded it as a \\"good introduction\\" to the wargaming genre, although Hughes believed that Iwo Jima was unlikely to provide established tacticians with a \\"major challenge\\" and the reviewer of ZX Computing was concerned that the game was \\"too easy\\". Sean Masterson of Crash criticised the graphics, stating that it was \\"let down by poor unit markers and terrain features\\". Gary Rook of Sinclair User asserted that the game was overall \\"competent\\", however he summarised it as \\"failing to excite\\". Rook also added that the game was well implemented and \\"inspiring\\". A reviewer of Computer and Video Games criticised the game for having an \\"awkward mechanism\\" due to the lack of a save feature and neglecting historic realism. However, he compared the historical accuracy of the Battle of Iwo Jima for being more accurate than Falklands '82s interpretation of the Falklands War. Mark Reed of Computer Gamer stated that the game is \\"ideal\\" for novice players and also praised the simplicity of the controls, despite suggesting that experienced gamers of the genre would prefer \\"something more complex\\". Masterson similarly criticised the game's suitability for experienced gamers, suggesting that any appeal for a more experienced player is likely to be \\"very limited\\". M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"While Iwo/Falklands may not be to the taste of the experienced wargamer, they may prove just the ticket to gaining another convert to computer conflict simulations.\\" References 1986 video games Commodore 64 games Single-player video games Turn-based strategy video games Video games developed in the United Kingdom World War II video games ZX Spectrum games Personal Software Services games ","title":"Iwo Jima (video game)"},{"id":"48624718","text":"235px Oswald Theodor Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene (born July 29, 1885 in Clarens, Switzerland; died on August 26, 1963 in Basel) was a German diplomat.

He studied Portuguese history and culture, and appealed to the nationalist sentiments of Salazar and other senior Portuguese personalities. He gave talks at the Universities of Lisbon and Coimbra on the past glories of the Portuguese Empire and positioned himself as a strong supporter of the culture and symbols of the Portuguese Estado Novo.

The performance was recorded at London's High Voltage Festival in 2010 by the Ronnie Lane Mobile Recording Unit. Originally released on Vinyl in 2012, the limited run of 1,000 copies quickly sold out, prompting a digital re-release in 2015 to cater for high demand for the album. The album was one of the first in the UK to be released on Neil Young's hi- fidelity digital format, PONO. Original Performance The original performance took place in Victoria Park, London, on Sunday 25 July 2010 as part of High Voltage Festival. Other acts on the bill included ZZ Top and Joe Bonamassa. Petit and his band played the Ace Cafe Stage. Petit's band consisted of Dick Taylor of The Pretty Things on bass, Jack Greenwood, also of The Pretty Things, on drums and Laurent Mouflier on harmonica. It was Taylor's first performance on bass guitar since leaving The Rolling Stones in 1962 and his bass playing on At High Voltage was described as \\"incredible\\". The 45 minute set (there are several tracks still unreleased from the concert) was recorded in analogue by The Ronnie Lane Mobile Studio (LMS), formerly owned by Ronnie Lane of The Faces and previously used to record the likes of Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Who. Blues Matters described Petit's performance at the festival as \\"one of two blues acts standing out like spicy scents against the pervading smell of mothballs\\" of the rest of the festival bill and suggested that the impact of Petit's set rivalled that of main stage blues act Joe Bonamassa. The performance itself has become part of British Blues folklore due to a failed attempt to shut the show down by Tower Hamlets Council Environmental Health officers for being too loud.

A thing is acceptable if it is sufficient to serve the purpose for which it is provided, even if it is far less usable for this purpose than the ideal example. A thing is unacceptable (or has the characteristic of unacceptability) if it deviates so far from the ideal that it is no longer sufficient to serve the desired purpose, or if it goes against that purpose. From a logical perspective, a thing can be said to be acceptable if it has no characteristics that make it unacceptable: Hungarian mathematician Imre Lakatos developed a concept of acceptability \\"taken as a measure of the approximation to the truth\\".W. Stegm√ºller, Collected Papers on Epistemology, Philosophy of Science and History of Philosophy, Volume 2 (2012), p. 104. This concept was criticized in its applicability to philosophy as requiring that better theories first be eliminated. Acceptability is also a key premise of negotiation, wherein opposing sides each begin from a point of seeking their ideal solution, and compromise until they reach a solution that both sides find acceptable: Where an unacceptable proposal has been made, \\"a counterproposal is generated if there are any acceptable ones that have had already been explored\\". Since the acceptability of proposition to a participant in a negotiation is only known to that participant, the participant may act as though a proposal that is actually acceptable to them is not, in order to obtain a more favorable proposal. Acceptable risk One concept of acceptability that has been widely studied is acceptable risk in situations affecting human health. The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy. It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk. Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially \\"acceptable\\" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk. Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals. In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity. Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives. There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no incineration is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator. Acceptable variance Acceptable variance is the range of variance in any direction from the ideal value that remains acceptable. In project management, variance can be defined as \\"the difference between what is planned and what is actually achieved\\".Guy L. De Furia, Project Management Recipes for Success (2008), p. 172. Degrees of variance \\"can be classified into negative variance, zero variance, acceptable variance, and unacceptable variance\\".Srinivasan Desikan, Software Testing: Principles and Practice (2006), p. 431. In software testing, for example, \\"[g]enerally 0-5% is considered as acceptable variance\\" from an ideal value. Acceptance testing is a practice used in chemical and engineering fields, intended to check ahead of time whether or not a thing will be acceptable.

It forms part of a countryside residence, which also includes a palace/farmhouse known as Ta' Torri Spero, and a garden between the palace and the tower. The tower was originally four stories high, with a balcony on its second floor, and it had a scarped base which made it somewhat similar to coastal watchtowers such as the De Redin towers. The tower had a coat of arms and an inscription commemorating its construction, but these are now lost. On 2 June 1941, during World War II, the British military requisitioned the tower from its owner Sir William John England, and used it as an Observation Post. It was prone to aerial bombardment due to its proximity to the RAF Luqa airfield. It was hit on 12 April 1942, and the bottom floor was damaged although the structure did not collapse. However, the Royal Air Force later decided to pull down the tower since it was deemed dangerous to the nearby airfield. The upper sections were pulled down, but the scarped ground floor and part of the first floor were retained.

The only stream running through this district is the Riedenbach, flowing in a northerly direction and almost completely canalised up to a short section between the Waldpark Sch√∂lerberg (Sch√∂lerberg Forest Park) and the Vila-Real-Platz. The following districts surround Sch√∂lerberg in a clockwise direction (starting from 12 o‚Äôclock): Innenstadt, Fledder, Voxtrup, Nahne, Kalkh√ºgel and W√ºste.  History  Sch√∂lerberg has been a popular local leisure area since the start of the 20th century. Numerous artifacts such as walls, steps and viewing platforms highlight the Sch√∂lerberg‚Äôs former usage as a forest park. In the early 1950s the restaurants aimed at day trippers and summer toboggan run made for attractive destinations for excursions. Quite early on the Sch√∂lerberg was connected to the Osnabr√ºck tramway network; tram line number two ran from the terminus station ‚ÄúSch√∂lerberg‚Äù along Iburger Stra√üe to Haste via Lutherkirche, Johannistor (Rosenplatz), Neumarkt, Nikolaiort and Hasetor.  Religion  The area‚Äôs largest churches are the Lutheran Lutherkirche (Luther Church) ‚Äì built in 1909 and retaining all its Jugendstil furnishings ‚Äì the Lutheran Lukaskirche (Luke Church) and the Catholic Kirche St. Joseph (St. Joseph‚Äôs Church), which was consecrated in 1917. The former Heilige Familie (Holy Family) Catholic parish church was converted into a columbarium church from 2009 to 2011. Furthermore the parish hall of the Reformed Evangelical Friedenskirche (Church of Peace) is located in the district; currently it is used as a youth church. In addition the district of Sch√∂lerberg is home to four Muslim places of worship (the Ditib, Aya-Sofia and Merkez mosques as well as one other).  Culture and places of interest  The Stadtpark Sch√∂lerberg (Sch√∂lerberg City Park) is situated on a limestone ridge (126m tall, with the same name and part of Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs mountainous region) and is home to a wide variety of natural species. Along with maple and beech trees there are also oaks, ashes, cherry trees and robinia present. Typical spring bloomers can also be found on the Sch√∂lerberg such as anemones, celandine, spotted arum and melic grass. The special location of the Sch√∂lerberg is also utilised by the nationally acclaimed Osnabr√ºcker Zoo which is situated in this area. After the opening of the Samburu Park, the Underirdische Zoo (Underground Zoo) was opened at the start of 2009, connecting the zoo to the neighbouring Natural History Museum (also known as the ‚ÄúMuseum am Sch√∂lerberg\\").Zoo Osnabr√ºck: Der \\"Unterirdische Zoo\\" wurde er√∂ffnet (Opening of the underground zoo (in German)) A planetarium and the Bodenpark Expo Project are situated in the immediate vicinity of the zoological gardens.  Sport  Two traditional sport clubs ‚Äì SC Sch√∂lerberg and SV Eintracht 08 Osnabr√ºck ‚Äì are located in the Sch√∂lerberg district, alongside football offering numerous other sports such as aerobics, badminton, basketball, women‚Äôs gymnastics, light athletics, sport shooting, tae-kwon-do, table tennis and regular tennis. The flagship sport club of the area, however ‚Äì known well beyond the boundaries of Osnabr√ºck ‚Äì is the Judo Crocodiles Osnabr√ºck. Founded in 1980 by J√ºrgen F√ºchtmeyer, it continues to produce judoka of national and international acclaim ‚Äì among them Julia Matijass, bronze medal winner at the 2004 Olympics, Oliver Gussenberg ‚Äì participant in the 2000 and 2004 games ‚Äì and most recently Martin Matijass, bronze medal winner at the European Under-17s Championships. The Crocodiles have also scored successes in team judo ‚Äì such as their 6 championship triumphs in the women‚Äôs First Bundesliga and, in 2012, victory at the male German Under-17s Team Championship. The sports centre on Iburger Stra√üe offers more than just judo, however ‚Äì the ju-jitsu department is also becoming more popular and, following on from gold and silver wins in German championships, had a runner-up European Champion in Axel Walter in 2013. The training centre with its 600m¬≤ judo hall is a mecca for judoka across the whole Osnabr√ºck region and its pull extends deep into North Rhine-Westphalia. However, fitness and sports rehabilitation can also be practiced in the 500m¬≤ fitness room.

Life Magee, or Eglinton, was an active participant in the discussion of the Irish Literary Revival, speaking in favour of more universal and cosmopolitan subjects, whereas the focus of several of his contemporaries was on Irish material and traditions. The ongoing debate between √Ü, Yeats, and Magee is the subject of a book Magee edited, Literary Ideals in Ireland (1898), which he published under his own name. As an author, Magee was mostly an essayist, with work appearing under the name of John Eglinton around the turn of the century in several publications, including the New Ireland Review, Shanachie, and the Unionist Daily Express of Dublin. In 1904 Magee launched a new literary magazine called Dana: an Irish Magazine of Independent Thought with Frederick Ryan and Oliver St John Gogarty among the contributors.James Carens, Surpassing Wit (New York: Columbia University Press, 1979), p. 22 He acted as joint editor until April 1905, and paid James Joyce one guinea for a poem.

Following its TV premiere it had a DVD release in several countries.  Plot  Sage Ryan, daughter of a demised garage owner, is a professional car thief. The police know her, but have always failed to convict her. Due to her aptitude to elude police she is notorious known as \\"The Banshee\\". One day everything changes when she steals a distinct vintage car (a 66 Dodge Charger) right before a date. Lacking in concentration, she drops her ID card at the crime scene and doesn't even realize the loss. After she has delivered the car to her fencer she returns home only to find a threatening letter. The owner of the stolen car has kidnapped her lover and demands his car back. Sage brings the car back to the parking area where she stole it and hopes that her lover will be released in exchange. Instead, she finds in her flat two police officers and her lover's corpse. The police consider her the number one suspect and try to arrest her. She barely escapes and starts an investigation of her own. Hunted by police and by her furious fencer, she tracks down the murderer, who turns out to be a serial killer. He has captured and is about to kill Sage's friend Brenna. She manages to save Brenna, only for the two to suddenly have to run for their lives.

These conditions include primary immunodeficiency, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Kawasaki disease, certain cases of HIV/AIDS and measles, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and certain other infections when a more specific immunoglobulin is not available. Depending on the formulation it can be given by injection into muscle, a vein, or under the skin. The effects last a few weeks. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection, muscle pain, and allergic reactions. Other severe side effects include kidney problems, anaphylaxis, blood clots, and red blood cell breakdown. Use is not recommended in people with some types of IgA deficiency. Use appears to be relatively safe during pregnancy. Human immunoglobulin is made from human blood plasma. It contains antibodies against many viruses. Human immunoglobulin therapy first occurred in the 1930s and a formulation for injection into a vein was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Each formulation of product is somewhat different. In the United Kingdom a dose cost the NHS between 11.20 and 1,200.00 pounds depending on the type and amount. A number of specific immunoglobulin formulations are also available including for hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, varicella infection, and Rh positive blood exposure.  Medical uses  Immunoglobulin therapy is used in a variety of conditions, many of which involve decreased or abolished antibody production capabilities, which range from a complete absence of multiple types of antibodies, to IgG subclass deficiencies (usually involving IgG2 or IgG3), to other disorders in which antibodies are within a normal quantitative range, but lacking in quality - unable to respond to antigens as they normally should ‚Äì resulting in an increased rate or increased severity of infections. In these situations, immunoglobulin infusions confer passive resistance to infection on their recipients by increasing the quantity/quality of IgG they possess. Immunoglobulin therapy is also used for a number of other conditions, including in many autoimmune disorders such as dermatomyositis in an attempt to decrease the severity of symptoms. Immunoglobulin therapy is also used in some treatment protocols for secondary immunodeficiencies such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), some autoimmune disorders (such as immune thrombocytopenia and Kawasaki disease), some neurological diseases (multifocal motor neuropathy, stiff person syndrome, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis) some acute infections and some complications of organ transplantation. Immunoglobulin therapy is especially useful in some acute infection cases such as pediatric HIV infection and is also considered the standard of treatment for some autoimmune disorders such as Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. The high demand which coupled with the difficulty of producing immunoglobulin in large quantities has resulted in increasing global shortages, usage limitations and rationing of immunoglobulin. Different national bodies and medical associations have established varying standards for the use of immunoglobulin therapy. = United Kingdom = The United Kingdom's National Health Service recommends the routine use of immunoglobulin for a variety of conditions including primary immunodeficiencies and a number of other conditions, but recommends against the use of immunoglobulin in sepsis (unless a specific toxin has been identified), multiple sclerosis, neonatal sepsis, and pediatric HIV. = United States = The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology most strongly supports the use of immunoglobulin for primary immunodeficiencies, while noting that such usage actually accounts for a minority of usage and acknowledging that immunoglobulin supplementation can be appropriately used for a number of other conditions, including neonatal sepsis (citing a sixfold decrease in mortality), considered in cases of HIV (including pediatric HIV), considered as a second line treatment in relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis, but recommending against its use in such conditions as chronic fatigue syndrome, PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) until further evidence to support its use is found (though noting that it may be useful in PANDAS patients with an autoimmune component), cystic fibrosis, and a number of other conditions. = Canada = The National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products of Canada (NAC) and Canadian Blood Services have also developed their own separate set of guidelines for the appropriate use of immunoglobulin therapy, which strongly support the use of immunoglobulin therapy in primary immunodeficiencies and some complications of HIV, while remaining silent on the issues of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome. = Australia= The Australian Red Cross Blood Service developed their own guidelines for the appropriate use of immunoglobulin therapy in 1997. Immunoglobulin is funded under the National Blood Supply and indications are classified as either an established or emerging therapeutic role or conditions for which immunoglobulin use is in exceptional circumstances only. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin access programs have been developed to facilitate hospital based programs. In Australia subcutaneous immunoglobulin is approved for primary immunodeficiency disease, specific antibody disease, acquired or secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. = European Union = Brands include HyQvia (human normal immunoglobulin), Privigen (human normal immunoglobulin (IVIg)), Hizentra (human normal immunoglobulin (SCIg)), Kiovig (human normal immunoglobulin), and Flebogamma DIF (human normal immunoglobulin). In the EU human normal immunoglobulin (SCIg) (Hizentra) is used in people whose blood does not contain enough antibodies (proteins that help the body to fight infections and other diseases), also known as immunoglobulins. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. It is used to treat the following conditions: * primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID, when people are born with an inability to produce enough antibodies); * low levels of antibodies in the blood in people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of a type of white blood cell) or myeloma (a cancer of another type of white blood cell) and who have frequent infections; * low levels of antibodies in the blood in people before or after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (a procedure where the patient's bone marrow is cleared of cells and replaced by stem cells from a donor); * chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this rare disease, the immune system (the body's defence system) works abnormally and destroys the protective covering over the nerves. It is indicated for replacement therapy in adults and children in primary immunodeficiency syndromes such as: * congenital agammaglobulinaemia and hypogammaglobulinaemia (low levels of antibodies); * common variable immunodeficiency; * severe combined immunodeficiency; * immunoglobulin-G-subclass deficiencies with recurrent infections; * replacement therapy in myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent infections.

Side effects  Although immunoglobulin is frequently used for long periods of time and is generally considered safe, immunoglobulin therapy can have severe adverse effects, both localized and systemic. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulin is associated with a lower risk of both systemic and localized risk when compared to intravenous administration (hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous administration is associated with a greater frequency of adverse effects than traditional subcutaneous administration but still a lower frequency of adverse effects when compared to intravenous administration). Patients who are receiving immunoglobulin and experience adverse events are sometimes recommended to take acetaminophen and diphenhydramine before their infusions to reduce the rate of adverse effects. Additional premedication may be required in some instances (especially when first getting accustomed to a new dosage), prednisone or another oral steroid. Local side effects of immunoglobulin infusions most frequently include an injection site reaction (reddening of the skin around the injection site), itching, rash, and hives. Less serious systemic side effects to immunoglobulin infusions include an increased heart rate, hyper or hypotension, an increased body temperature, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, arthralgia or myalgia, dizziness, headache, fatigue, fever, and pain. Serious side effects of immunoglobulin infusions include chest discomfort or pain, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, hyponatremia, hemolysis, hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, hepatitis, anaphylaxis, backache, aseptic meningitis, acute kidney injury, hypokalemic nephropathy, pulmonary embolism, and transfusion related acute lung injury. There is also a small chance that even given the precautions taken in preparing immunoglobulin preparations, an immunoglobulin infusion may pass a virus to its recipient. Some immunoglobulin solutions also contain isohemagglutinins, which in rare circumstances can cause hemolysis by the isohemagglutinins triggering phagocytosis. In the case of less serious side effects, a patient's infusion rate can be adjusted downwards until the side effects become tolerable, while in the case of more serious side effects, emergency medical attention should be sought. Immunoglobulin therapy also interferes with the ability of the body to produce a normal immune response to an attenuated live virus vaccine for up to a year, can result in falsely elevated blood glucose levels, and can interfere with many of the IgG-based assays often used to diagnose a patient with a particular infection. Routes of administration = 1950s ‚Äì intramuscular= After immunoglobulin therapy's discovery and description in Pediatrics in 1952, weekly intramuscular injections of immunoglobulin (IMIg) were the norm until intravenous formulations (IVIg) began to be introduced in the 1980s. During the mid and late 1950s, one-time IMIG injections were a common public health response to outbreaks of polio before the widespread availability of vaccines. Intramuscular injections were extremely poorly tolerated due to their extreme pain and poor efficacy ‚Äì rarely could intramuscular injections alone raise plasma immunoglobulin levels enough to make a clinically meaningful difference. = 1980s ‚Äì intravenous = Intravenous formulations began to be approved in the 1980s, which represented a significant improvement over intramuscular objections, as they allowed for a sufficient amount of immunoglobulin to be injected to reach clinical efficacy, although they still had a fairly high rate of adverse effects (though the addition of stabilizing agents reduced this further). = 1990s - subcutaneous = The first description of a subcutaneous route of administration for immunoglobulin therapy dates back to 1980, but for many years subcutaneous administration was considered to be a secondary choice, only to be considered when peripheral venous access was no longer possible or tolerable. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became obvious that for at least a subset of patients the systemic adverse events associated with intravenous therapy were still not easily tolerable, and more doctors began to experiment with subcutaneous immunoglobulin administration, culminating in an ad hoc clinical trial in Sweden of 3000 subcutaneous injections administered to 25 adults (most of whom had previously experienced systemic adverse effects with IMIg or IVIg), where no infusion in the ad hoc trial resulted in a severe systemic adverse reaction, and most subcutaneous injections were able to be administered in non-hospital settings, allowing for considerably more freedom for the people involved. In the later 1990s, large-scale trials began in Europe to test the feasibility of subcutaneous immunoglobulin administration, although it was not until 2006 that the first subcutaneous-specific preparation of immunoglobulin was approved by a major regulatory agency (Vivaglobin, which was voluntarily discontinued in 2011). A number of other trade names of subcutaneous immunoglobulin have since been approved, although some small-scale studies have indicated that a particular cohort of patients with Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) may suffer intolerable side effects with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) that they do not with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Although intravenous was the preferred route for immunoglobulin therapy for many years, in 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first preparation of immunoglobulin that was designed exclusively for subcutaneous use.  Mechanism of action  The precise mechanism by which immunoglobulin therapy suppresses harmful inflammation is likely multifactorial. For example, it has been reported that immunoglobulin therapy can block Fas-mediated cell death. Perhaps a more popular theory is that the immunosuppressive effects of immunoglobulin therapy are mediated through IgG's Fc glycosylation. By binding to receptors on antigen presenting cells, IVIG can increase the expression of the inhibitory Fc receptor, FcgRIIB, and shorten the half-life of auto-reactive antibodies. The ability of immunoglobulin therapy to suppress pathogenic immune responses by this mechanism is dependent on the presence of a sialylated glycan at position CH2-84.4 of IgG. Specifically, de-sialylated preparations of immunoglobulin lose their therapeutic activity and the anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG can be recapitulated by administration of recombinant sialylated IgG1 Fc. There are several other proposed mechanisms of action and the actual primary targets of immunoglobulin therapy in autoimmune disease are still being elucidated. Some believe that immunoglobulin therapy may work via a multi-step model where the injected immunoglobulin first forms a type of immune complex in the patient. Once these immune complexes are formed, they can interact with Fc receptors on dendritic cells, which then mediate anti-inflammatory effects helping to reduce the severity of the autoimmune disease or inflammatory state. Other proposed mechanisms include the possibility that donor antibodies may bind directly with the abnormal host antibodies, stimulating their removal; the possibility that IgG stimulates the host's complement system, leading to enhanced removal of all antibodies, including the harmful ones; and the ability of immunoglobulin to block the antibody receptors on immune cells (macrophages), leading to decreased damage by these cells, or regulation of macrophage phagocytosis. Indeed, it is becoming more clear that immunoglobulin can bind to a number of membrane receptors on T cells, B cells, and monocytes that are pertinent to autoreactivity and induction of tolerance to self. A recent report stated that immunoglobulin application to activated T cells leads to their decreased ability to engage microglia. As a result of immunoglobulin treatment of T cells, the findings showed reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 in T cell-microglia co-culture. The results add to the understanding of how immunoglobulin may affect inflammation of the central nervous system in autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Society and culture =Brand names= As biologicals, various trade names of immunoglobulin products are not necessarily interchangeable, and care must be exercised when changing between them. Trade names of intravenous immunoglobulin formulations include Flebogamma, Gamunex, Privigen, Octagam and Gammagard, while trade names of subcutaneous formulations include Cutaquig, Cuvitru, HyQvia, Hizentra, Gamunex-C, and Gammaked. = Supply issues = The United States is one of a handful of countries that allow plasma donors to be paid, meaning that the US supplies much of the plasma- derived medicinal products (including immunoglobulin) used across the world, including more than 50% of the European Union's supply. The Council of Europe has officially endorsed the idea of not paying for plasma donations for both ethical reasons and reasons of safety, but studies have found that relying on entirely voluntary plasma donation leads to shortages of immunoglobulin and forces member countries to import immunoglobulin from countries that do compensate donors. In Australia, blood donation is voluntary and therefore to cope with increasing demand and to reduce the shortages of locally produced immunoglobulin, several programs have been undertaken including adopting plasma for first time blood donors, better processes for donation, plasma donor centres and encouraging current blood donors to consider plasma only donation.

This drag reduces the relative velocity of pebbles as they pass by larger bodies, preventing some from escaping the body's gravity. These pebbles are then accreted by the body after spiraling or settling toward its surface. This process increases the cross section over which the large bodies can accrete material, accelerating their growth. The rapid growth of the planetesimals via pebble accretion allows for the formation of giant planet cores in the outer Solar System before the dispersal of the gas disk. A reduction in the size of pebbles as they lose water ice after crossing the ice line and a declining density of gas with distance from the sun slow the rates of pebble accretion in the inner Solar System resulting in smaller terrestrial planets, a small mass of Mars and a low mass asteroid belt. Description Pebbles ranging in size from centimeters up to a meter in size are accreted at an enhanced rate in a protoplanetary disk. A protoplanetary disk is made up of a mix of gas and solids including dust, pebbles, planetesimals, and protoplanets. Gas in a protoplanetary disk is pressure supported and as a result orbits at a velocity slower than large objects. The gas affects the motions of the solids in varying ways depending on their size, with dust moving with the gas and the largest planetesimals orbiting largely unaffected by the gas. Pebbles are an intermediate case, aerodynamic drag causes them to settle toward the central plane of the disk and to orbit at a sub-keplerian velocity resulting in radial drift toward the central star. The pebbles frequently encounter planetesimals as a result of their lower velocities and inward drift. If their motions were unaffected by the gas only a small fraction, determined by gravitational focusing and the cross-section of the planetesimals, would be accreted by the planetesimals. The remainder would follow hyperbolic paths, accelerating toward the planetesimal on their approach and decelerating as they recede. However, the drag the pebbles experience grows as their velocities increase, slowing some enough that they become gravitationally bound to the planetesimal. These pebbles continue to lose energy as they orbit the planetesimal causing them to spiral toward and be accreted by the planetesimal. Small planetesimals accrete pebbles that are drifting past them at the relative velocity of the gas. Those pebbles with stopping times similar to the planetesimal's Bondi time are accreted from within its Bondi radius. In this context the Bondi radius is defined as the distance at which an object approaching a planetesimal at the relative velocity of the gas is deflected by one radian; the stopping time is the exponential timescale for the deceleration of an object due to gas drag, and the Bondi time is the time required for an object to cross the Bondi radius. Since the Bondi radius and Bondi time increase with the size of the planetesimal, and the stopping time increases with the size of the pebble, the optimal pebble size increases with size of planetesimal. Smaller objects, with ratios of stopping times to Bondi times less than 0.1, are pulled from the flow past the planetesimal and accreted from a smaller radius which declines with the square root of this ratio. Larger, weakly coupled pebbles are also accreted less efficiently due to three body effects with the radius accreted from declining rapidly between ratios of 10 and 100. The Bondi radius is proportional to the mass of the planetesimal so the relative growth rate is proportional to mass squared resulting in runaway growth. The aerodynamic deflection of the gas around the planetesimal reduces the efficiency of pebble accretion resulting in a maximum growth timescale at 100 km. Larger planetesimals, above a transition mass of roughly Ceres mass in the inner solar system and Pluto mass in the outer solar system, accrete pebbles with Stoke's numbers near one from their Hill radii. The Stokes number in this context is the product of stopping time and the keplerian frequency. As with small planetesimals the radius from which pebbles accrete declines for smaller and larger pebble sizes. The optimal pebble size for large planetesimals measures in cm's due to a combination of the accretion radius and the radial drift rates of the pebbles. As objects grow their accretion changes from 3-D, with accretion from part of the thickness of the pebble disk, to 2D with accretion from full thickness of pebble disk. The relative growth rate in 2-D accretion is proportional to mass^{2/3} leading to oligarchical growth and the formation of similar sized bodies. Pebble accretion can result in doubling of mass of an Earth-massed core in as little as 5500 years, reducing the timescales for growth of the cores of giant planets by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude relative to planetesimal accretion. The gravitational influence of these massive bodies can create a partial gap in the gas disk altering the pressure gradient. The velocity of gas then becomes super-keplerian outside the gap stopping the inward drift of pebbles and ending pebble accretion. Outer Solar System If the formation of pebbles is slow, pebble accretion leads to the formation of a few gas giants in the outer Solar System. The formation of the gas giants is a long-standing problem in planetary science. The accretion of the cores of giant planets via the collision and mergers of planetesimals is slow and may be difficult to complete before the gas disk dissipates. (Although formation via planetesimal collisions can be accomplished within the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary disc.) The largest planetesimals can grow much faster via pebble accretion, but if the formation or delivery of pebbles is rapid numerous Earth-mass planets form instead of a few giant planet cores. As the largest objects approach Earth- mass the radius from which pebbles are accreted is limited by the Hill radius. This slows their growth relative to their neighbors and allows many objects to accrete similar masses of pebbles. However, if the formation or the delivery of pebbles is slow growth timescales becomes longer than the time required for gravitationally stirring. The largest planetesimals then excite the inclinations and eccentricities of the smaller planetesimals. Their inclined orbits keep small planetesimals outside of the narrow disk of pebbles during most of their orbits, limiting their growth. The period of runaway growth is then extended and the largest objects are able to accrete a sizable fraction of the pebbles and grow into giant planet cores. As the cores grow larger some reach masses sufficient to create partial gaps in the gas disk, altering its pressure gradient and blocking the inward drift of pebbles. Accretion of pebbles is then halted and the gas envelope surrounding the core cools and collapses allowing for the rapid accretion of gas and the formation of a gas giant. Cores that do not grow massive enough to clear gaps in the pebble disk are only able to accrete small gas envelopes and instead become ice giants. The rapid growth via pebble accretion allows the cores to grow large enough to accrete massive gas envelopes forming gas giants while avoiding migrating very close to the star. In simulations cold gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn can form via pebble accretion if their initial embryos began growing beyond 20 AU. This distant formation offers a potential explanation for Jupiter's enrichment in noble gases. However, dedicated formation models indicate that it is difficult to reconcile growth via pebble accretion with the final mass and composition of the solar system ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Inner Solar System The terrestrial planets may be much smaller than the giant planets due to the sublimation of water ice as pebbles crossed the ice line. The radial drift of pebbles causes them to cross the ice line where water ice sublimates releasing silicate grains. The silicate grains are less sticky than icy grains resulting in bouncing, or fragmentation during collisions and the formation of smaller pebbles. These smaller pebbles are dispersed into a thicker disk by the turbulence in the gas disk. The mass flow of solids drifting through the terrestrial region is also reduced by half by the loss of water ice. In combination these two factors significantly reduce the rate at which mass is accreted by planetesimals in the inner Solar System relative to the outer Solar System. As a result, lunar mass planetary embryos in the inner Solar System are able to grow only to around Mars-mass, whereas in the outer Solar System they are able to grow to more than 10x Earth-mass forming the cores of giant planets. Beginning instead with planetesimals formed via streaming instabilities yields similar results in the inner Solar System. In the asteroid belt the largest planetesimals grow into Mars-massed embryos. These embryos stir the smaller planetesimals, increasing their inclinations, causing them to leave the pebble disk. The growth of these smaller planetesimals is stalled at this point, freezing their size distribution near that of the current asteroid belt. The variation of accretion efficiency with pebble size during this process results in the size sorting of the chondrules observed in the primitive meteorites. In the terrestrial zone pebble accretion plays a smaller role. Here growth is due to a mix of pebble and planetesimal accretion until an oligarchical configuration of isolated lunar-massed embryos forms. Continued growth due to the accretion of inward drifting chondrules increases the mass of these embryos until their orbits are destabilized, leading to giant impacts between the embryos and the formation of Mars-sized embryos. The cutoff of the inward drift of icy pebbles by the formation of Jupiter before the ice line moved into the terrestrial region would limit the water fraction of the planets formed from these embryos. The small mass of Mars and the low mass asteroid belt may be the result of pebble accretion becoming less efficient as the density of gas in the protoplanetary disk decreases. The protoplanetary disk from which the Solar System formed is thought to have had a surface density that decreased with distance from the Sun and have been flared, with an increasing thickness with distance from the Sun. As a result, the density of the gas and the aerodynamic drag felt by pebbles embedded in the disk would have decreased significantly with distance. If the pebbles were large the efficiency of pebble accretion would decline with distance from the Sun as the aerodynamic drag becomes too weak for the pebbles to be captured during encounters with the largest objects. An object that grows rapidly at Earth's orbital distance would only grow slowly in Mars's orbit and very little in the asteroid belt. The formation of Jupiter's core could also reduce the mass of the asteroid belt by creating a gap in the pebble disk and halting the inward drift of pebbles from beyond the ice line. Objects in the asteroid belt would then be deprived of pebbles early while objects in the terrestrial region continued to accrete pebbles that drifted in from the asteroid region.

He is also the co-chair of the Campbell Collaboration's Crime and Justice Group. Career From 1986 to 2006, Killias was a professor of Criminal Law, Criminal Procedural Law and Criminology at the University of Lausanne and Director of that University‚Äôs Institute of Criminology and Criminal Law. From 1984 to 2008, he was also a part-time judge at the Swiss Federal Court. Research One study conducted by Killias looked at 18 different countries and found a moderate correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates across these countries, as well as a much stronger correlation between gun ownership rates and suicide rates. Another study by him found that gun ownership in Switzerland may have increased domestic crime rates in that country. Views on gun violence Killias has said that \\"the fewer guns there are in cellars, attics and armoires, then that would be helpful, because there is a strong correlation between guns kept in private homes and incidences occurring at home - like private disputes involving the husband shooting the wife and maybe the children, and then committing suicide.\\" He has also said that as the Swiss government reduced the size of its Army, gun violence rates in that country have dropped. In response to those who cite Switzerland as evidence that guns deter violence, Killias has said that in Switzerland, \\"We have guns at home, but they are kept for peaceful purposes. There is no point taking the gun out of your home in Switzerland because it is illegal to carry a gun in the street. To shoot someone who just looks at you in a funny way - this is not Swiss culture!\\" Honors and awards In 2001, Killias received the Sellin- Glueck Award from the American Society of Criminology. In 2008, he received the G.O.W. Mueller Award for outstanding research in international criminal law from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the Panteion University of Athens. In 2017, he received the Beccaria Medal in Gold from the Deutsche Kriminologische Gesellschaft. In 2020, Killias received the award for the Distinguished Services to the European Society of Criminology Award in recognition of outstanding service contributions to its effective functioning.

Tom  The action takes place in the years from 1924 all the way to the early 1950s in the Kurkureu village of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic, which is now Kyrgyzstan. The Russian Civil War ended not so long ago. Young Komsomol member and a former Red Army soldier Dyuyshen comes to the village as the new teacher of the village. His enthusiasm to bring new ideas immediately faces a centuries-old tradition of life in Central Asia. The former soldier tries to improve literacy to this far Moslem area while villagers didn't allow g·ªârls to attend school. He then met Altynai, a 15-year-old illiterate girl who has a burning desire to study, but her aunt sells her to a powerful and wealthy chieftain. The school is burned down. The film ends with the promise of it being rebuilt using a centuries-old tree which had been a source of pride to the local population.

The film stars Vijay as the titular character and Keerthy Suresh in the lead roles, while Jagapathi Babu, Daniel Balaji, Sathish, Thambi Ramaiah, Mime Gopi, Sija Rose, Harish Uthaman, and Aparna Vinod, amongst others, play supporting roles. The music is composed by Santhosh Narayanan, the editing is by Praveen K. L., production design by M. Prabhaharan and the cinematography is handled by M. Sukumar. After entering production in early 2016, the film progressed under the tentative title of Vijay 60, before being named as Bairavaa during September 2016. The film had a worldwide release on 12 January 2017.https://www.ibtimes.co.in/ilayathalapathy-vijays-bairavaa-censored-be- released-january-12-710876 The film completed a 50-day theatrical run and performed well financially. Plot Bairavaa (Vijay), a collection agent for ICCI Bank in Chennai, is a righteous person who is willing to employ even violent means to get back money from debtors. During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi (Keerthy Suresh), a medical student from Kallidaikurichi in Tirunelveli district, and immediately falls in love with her. When he goes to the Koyambedu bus station to propose his love to Malar before she leaves Chennai, he notices her cornered by a group of thugs who plan to kill her as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's (Sharath Lohitashwa) son Charan (Roshan Basheer). However, they back off after receiving a call from one Periyakannu alias PK (Jagapathi Babu) from Tirunelveli, who tells them not to harm her. Bairavaa confronts Malar, who tells him why PK spared her life. Malar studies in PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal don and politician who runs Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran (Daniel Balaji). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malar and her friend Vaishali (Aparna Vinod) lodged a complaint against the college to the MCI, who decided to blacklist the college after noting the poor facilities. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for them having sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali, who was the girl chosen by the officials, was found raped and killed the next morning. Malar's father (Aadukalam Naren), a sincere police officer, began an investigation into PK's involvement in Vaishali's death, but he too was killed by PK in retribution. After her father's death, Malar dragged PK to court, where the judge declared that Malar should not be expelled and must not be harmed till the case is resolved, even though she had filed the complaint against PK. Though PK respects the judge's decision, he harasses Malar indirectly through the college lecturers and by cutting power and water to her locality. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malar had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan, since, being a Union Minister's son, he would have access to the NIC where the video would be investigated. Charan was later attacked by PK's henchmen, who then took away the video evidence and put the blame on Malar. Bairavaa, on hearing Malar's story, decides to help her fight PK and get justice for Vaishali and leaves for Kallidaikurichi with her. Posing as an income tax officer, Bairavaa conducts a raid at PK's mansion, taking away all the evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. PK soon realizes that Bairavaa is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between Bairavaa and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them, leaving Bairavaa with no evidence to implicate PK, though he manages to get five more days time from the court to get the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife (Vishalini), who was terminally ill, passes away. Bairavaa decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to get him on his side and make him approver against PK. He switches PK's asthma inhaler with nitrous oxide. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before going to Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to laugh uncontrollably, even during the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bairavaa's offer of becoming approver. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death. Bairavaa decides to finish off PK once and for all as that is the only way he can now get justice for Malar and Vaishali. He frames PK for plotting to assassinate the Prime Minister of India while he is on the way to the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The news spreads all across India and soon it is ordered to shoot PK on sight. PK, realizing that he is cornered, tries to kill Bairavaa before he dies, but Bairavaa manages to dodge him. He then disguises himself as a NSG commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos who have arrived at the building, and kills PK. In the end, the verdict is declared in favor of Bairavaa and Malar. PK's henchmen are arrested, while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bairavaa, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges is honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education.

Irman Gusman began his political career in 1999 as member of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), representing West Sumatra. In 2004, he was elected member of the newly formed DPD, representing West Sumatra and became vice-chairman of the DPD with chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita its speaker.Irman Gusman Biography at Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia Irman was elected chairman of the DPD on 2 October 2009, having received 81 votes over his opponent Laode Ida's 46 votes.

The Supreme Court verdict also cancelled the Central Jakarta court's verdict as well as all the graft charges that had been slapped on him by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), the reason Irman Gusman was able to leave Sukamiskin prison in Bandung on Sept. 26 and he is now a free man.
