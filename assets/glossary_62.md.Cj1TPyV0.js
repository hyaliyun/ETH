By the end of the meeting, the structure of the new organisation, as well as a constitution, had been agreed. Stuart Henson drew up the constitution, which had been agreed, and the Borrowash Band Fund was opened at the Midland Bank. The opening balance of ¬£11 was the donation of ¬£1 from each of the Founder Members. To these people we are eternally grateful. At a committee meeting in January 1981, the name of the band was added to the constitution. The band may well have been called The Skyliners but after much debate the name, Ambassadors of Borrowash, was chosen. The band joined the CBSL (Carnival Band Secretaries League) in the fall of 1981 and the performing members were equipped with uniforms. The first public performance came on 10 July 1982 in a contest at Allestree where the band came third. Derby Regalia came first on this occasion. They continued to compete for the rest of the season as they gained confidence and experience. Whilst entertaining the public at various f√™tes, galas and shows, the band continued to improve in contests until on 25 June 1983 they achieved their first win in a competition. The contest at Duffield saw the Ambassadors secure first place with 77 out of 100 points beating the Rangers of Derby and the Derby Regalia who tied for second place with 76 points. The band was invited to take part in the 2005 Birmingham Tattoo. Alongside bands such as the band of the Coldstream Guards and many others.

It is found only in western and southwestern Thailand and the adjacent southeastern Myanmar. A specimen has been preserved in the British Natural History Museum, London since the early 20th century. Due to its resemblance to Wall's Bronzeback, the scientific name was formerly assigned under Dendrelaphis cyanochloris, the species name for Wall's bronzeback. It was formally described as a distinct species in 2012 by Gernot Vogel, Johan Van Rooijen and Sjon Hauser. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature report, it became one of the 367 important new species discovered in the Greater Mekong during 2012 and 2013. Analayses show its significant differences from the typical Wall's bronzeback, including colouration and scales on the neck. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of sawtooth-shaped scales on the back of its neck. This feature is unique among the bronzeback species, and the reason for its common name. In general, they are also larger, the largest specimen measuring 1.63 m in length. It is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species of 2014. Description Dendrelaphis nigroserratus is relatively large species among the bronzeback snakes. The holotype (QSMI 1282) is a juvenile female collected by Sjon Hauser in 2011 from Umphang District in Tak Province. It is 42.8 cm long, and its tail is 13.5 cm long, which is 31.5% of the total body length. Its eyes are conspicuous measuring 0.4 cm in diameter. The largest specimen is a dead female found on the road in Umphang District, and measures 1.63 m long. On average it is much longer than the closely related species such as Dendrelaphis cyanochloris and Dendrelaphis striatus. The general body colour is olive-brown. The head and back are greenish bronze, and the belly is yellowish or greyish green. It can be distinguished from other species from its thick black stripe behind the eye. The broad black streak is relatively broad on the head and runs from behind the eyes, continues as a broad bar on the neck where it breaks up incompletely. This splitting gives rise to a saw-toothed pattern, the reason for its common name as well as its specific epithet, nigroserratus (a Latin niger for \\"black\\", and serrare meaning \\"to saw\\"). Slightly posterior to this point, it splits completely into broad oblique bars that gradually disappear. This colour pattern in not seen in another species. It is a carnivore and is known to feed on frogs. Discovery The first specimen collected was from Myeik (then Mergui) in Myanmar (then Burma) in the early 20th century. It was preserved in the Natural History Museum, London. It was regarded as member of the species Dendrelaphis cyanochloris (Wall's bronzeback) because of their fundamental similarities, including similar habitats. A systematic study in 2003 supported this identification. However, the common sawtooth-necked bronzeback has slight differences from the typical Wall's bronzeback. This distinction was analysed by Gernot Vogel of the Society for Southeast Asian Herpetology in Germany, Johan Van Rooijen of Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis, and Sjon Hauser. They published their findings in 2012 in Zootaxa, reclassifying the snake as a new species. The holotype is deposited and maintained at the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (Bangkok Snake Farm on Rama IV Road) in Bangkok, Thailand. Distribution Other than Mergui region in Myanmar, Dendrelaphis nigroserratus is found in isolated areas around the Thailand-Myanmar border, such as Phetchaburi, Kanchanaburi and Tak provinces. It is most abundant in southern Tak Province, where a number of road kills occurs every year. They are found in the hill evergreen forests at elevations of over 800 metres, near streams and in bamboo thickets.

Career  Hannes Stockinger studied Biotechnology at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna and received his doctorate from this University in 1985. At the Medical University of Vienna, he is currently full professor for molecular immunology and Head of the Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology and of one of its subunits, the Institute for Hygiene and Applied Immunology. He is co-founder of the Competence Center for Biomolecular Therapeutics, a precompetitive platform at the Medical University of Vienna (who is the main shareholder of this institution) with the pharmaceutical industry which aimed to identify targets for the treatment of inflammatory and immunological diseases. His international scientific acceptance and recognition in immunology is reflected in the variety of functions in national and international scientific societies and organizations, in which he was elected or asked during his career: He was amongst others President of the Austrian Society for Allergology and Immunology (√ñGAI), board member of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and Treasurer of the European Association of Immunological Societies (EFIS). Furthermore, Hannes Stockinger is executive editor of the scientific journals Immunology Letters and BioMed Research International.  Research  Hannes Stockinger and his research team discovered and described for the first time a number of critical receptors on the surface of immune cells, which not only provide an insight into the regulation of the immune system, but are also potential targets for therapeutic purposes. In addition, his research on cell membrane structures called lipid rafts is of significant importance: Today, it is believed that these lipid-rafts are the first coordinating points of the cell, which process and control the signals from the environment.  Publications  His work on the first description of a number of cell surface receptors of human immune cells (such as CD31, CD147, etc.) and the contributions to the understanding of signal transduction across the plasma membrane by the lipid-rafts are highly regarded.

He lived and worked in Ljubljana.  Life  Gorazd Sotler was born on July 1, 1930 in ≈†entrupert na Dolenjskem. His family later moved to Ljubljana. As a child, he learned to play the violin and he showed great drawing talent from an early age, which was confirmed by one of the famous sculptors of that time Boris Kalin. He attended primary and secondary school (classics programme) in Ljubljana between 1937 and 1949. Afterwards, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Ljubljana where he studied with professors Boris and Zdenko Kalin. In 1953, he travelled to Zagreb and specialised in sculpture studies at the Academy of Fine Arts at the famous sculpture Antun Avgustinƒçiƒç. Gorazd Sotler graduated in 1954. During his studies in Zagreb, young Gorazd was greatly influenced by more lyrical sculpture Frano Kr≈°iniƒá who was making female nude sculptures at that time. A diary exists from this period which shows great idealism and sensitivity of the young artist. Even later, female nudes, self-portraits, portraits and drawings remained the main theme in Sotler's opus. After a short trip to Paris in 1954, Sotler finished his postgraduate studies at professor Boris Kalin in Ljubljana. Figurative influences, which brought so much inspiration for the young artist in Zagreb, were not well received in Ljubljana. The problem was that sculptures at home were much more in line with modernism so other artist and professionals did not pay much attention to Sotler's art. Furthermore, studying in Zagreb broke the continuum of sculpturing in his home town, which resulted in his lack of success to receive a public commission. He withdrew into the world of intimate plastic. He also shared his studio with a painter Marjan Dovjak for a couple of years and made an unusual portrait of the artist during that time. This portrait was later considered as one of the most astonishing portraits of the era. In May 1958, he married Sonja, n√©e Beretiƒç, from ≈†marjeta pri Novem mestu and in October of the same year they got a daughter Alenka Sottler, who has become one of the leading illustrators in the world. After the wedding, he took a job of a primary arts teacher in Ljubljana, where he was much loved and respected by his pupils. In the last years of his life, he left his job, got a divorce and married for the second time. His new wife was Aljo≈°a, n√©e Koser, and they moved to ≈†kofja Loka. Due to poor health, he almost stopped sculpturing and focused on ceramics and painting. His untimely death ended his creativity much too soon. He died on April 21, 1987 in ≈†kofja Loka, where he is also buried.  Work  Gorazd Sotler created sculptures from different materials, but most of his work was done in iron. He welded it to form various shapes, which in parts still reflect the real nature of things. His work contains rhythmic patterns, which he achieved by repeating details. His sculptures are created in relief and usually combined from two or more figures. While teaching at the primary school, he was commissioned to create various children's portraits, tomb sculptures, abstract sculptures in clay, wood, iron and stone. He studied female nude art and self-portrait. Many drawings and small statues were created every day, but most of them ended up in trash due to the artist's severe self-criticism. People still recount this anecdote: ‚ÄòOne day, his wife‚Äôs brother Marjan visited him in the studio. When Marjan was on his way back home, he thought he saw something in the trash. When he had a closer look, he realised there was a box full of small female nude statues. He quickly took them out and carried them home, where he washed and polished them. After a couple of months, Sotler returned his visit to Marjan. When he saw a small exhibition of the little female nude statues, he became very excited and asked him: ‚ÄòWhere on earth did you get such beautiful statues?!‚Äô Marjan told him: ‚ÄòAs a matter of fact in the trash behind your house.‚Äô Sotler could not believe his ears for he found these statues too beautiful to be his.‚Äô Sotler‚Äôs extreme self-criticism remains one of the main reasons why so little of his work has been preserved. In the last years of his life, Sotler created a beautiful collection of paintings and ceramic sculptures. He also received a public commission to create a ceramic sculpture for the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana. His drawing were accepted at the international biennial of drawing in Rijeka (Croatia).

Florence's father was born in 1843 in Gablonz, North Bohemia, a town in the Czech Republic known for glass and jewellery production. Florence's mother was Frances Lehmaier (b. 1852 New York, USA; d. 1893 London, England). Florence was the elder sister of Bernard Edwin Strauss (born 1874) and Lily Julia Strauss (1877-1955), who later married George May, 1st Baron May, and became Lady Lily Julia May, 1st Baroness of Weybridge. Early years 1881: Bleak House, Brixton In 1881, Florence (8) was living with her father (38) and mother (29) in Bleak House, 7 Elgin Gardens, Effra Road, Brixton, in the Borough of Lambeth, London.

[Note: Please do not add a hyperlink to this website] Marriage settlement On marriage, Florence Conybeare became the 'beneficial owner' of, among other properties, the Tregullow Offices, a small dwelling and former mine office The property was owned by, and lived in by, Sir William Robert Williams, 3rd Baronet of Tregullow, Cornwall, whose great grandfather was the mining mogul who built Scorrier House in 1778, built the Plymouth breakwater with the Fox family, controlled the copperbelt and copper smelting works in Swansea, developed the harbour at Portreath and linked it to the mineral tramway, which was used to deliver timber and supplies to mines and transported valuable minerals back down to the sea. in Scorrier in the County of Cornwall, as part of a marriage settlement which her husband, Charles A.V. Conybeare, arranged with various parties including the wealthy merchant banker Isaac Seligman. The marriage settlement was effected by means of a Deed of Trust signed by three moneylenders, two of whom had attended the same public school as Charles Conybeare: Tonbridge School, in Kent, and one family member (uncle). \\"In those days, a marriage settlement was settled upon the marriage.\\" Ian K. Nelson, conveyancing solicitor at the law firm of Nelson Nichols, Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK, 2009. Such settlements can be compared to prenuptials and should not be confused with financial settlements made on the dissolution of a marriage. In those days, it was a convenient way for a husband-to-be to make adequate financial provision for his wife-to-be. This prevented a wife from otherwise becoming destitute as a result of the husband deserting his wife, or from having to resort to prostitution in order to support herself.  1896 Deed of Trust _Background_ On 11 March 1891, Florence's husband Charles Conybeare conveyed various properties The 1901 Conveyance, which refers back to the Indenture (conveyance) of 1891, records the words inter alia, which indicates that several properties were involved in the original loan, not just the Tregullow Offices. by way of a mortgage to William Henry Luard Pattisson and to the parties referred to in Point 2 of the 1896 Deed of Trust. In this mortgage arrangement, Charles Conybeare was able to secure a loan of ‚Ç§3,000 from his moneylenders, using the properties as collateral for the loan and the repayment of interest on the outstanding loan. Transcription of first page of 1902 Conveyance between Conybeares & CRWilliams Deed of Trust On 14 October 1896, the day before Florence got married, Charles A. V. Conybeare placed those \\"various properties\\" including the Tregullow Offices (known together as \\"the estate\\") in trust‚Äîwhich properties were still subject to a mortgage‚Äîto Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (Charles's brother and JP) and merchant banker Isaac Seligman. As a result, Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the legal owners and trustees of the estate. This construction enabled Charles Conybeare to confer financial benefits to Florence Conybeare, so that when parts of the estate were sold, she would be entitled to a share of the proceeds. The Deed of Trust that was drawn up to make this possible, recognised four interested parties: 1\\\\. Charles A.V. Conybeare (husband and trustor). 2\\\\. Jacob Luard Pattisson (civil servant), James Jollie Pattisson (teacher) and Bixby Garnham Luard (vicar and uncle to the first two): the mortgagees (read: moneylenders). 3\\\\. Charles A.V. Conybeare and Florence Annie Conybeare (beneficial owners). 4\\\\. Isaac Seligman and Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (legal owners and trustees). \\"Although Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the owners of the legal estate the moment it was conveyed to them in 1896, they never actually owned the properties themselves. They simply held on to the properties in trust as part of a marriage settlement, and were only entitled to act on the couple's instructions\\", not independently of them. Florence sells property interest On 21 July 1902, Florence Conybeare was a co-signatory to the 1902 Deed of Conveyance (Indenture) which instructed Isaac Seligman and Henry Conybeare to sell her beneficial interest in _one_ of the estate's properties, namely, the Tregullow Offices. In doing so, she effectively sold that property with her husband, for ‚Ç§170, to a mining engineer called Charles Rule Williams, who had recently returned from Mexico after working 15 years in silver mines at Zimapan. The new owner changed the name of the property to Zimapan Villa. Marital homes Florence and Charles Conybeare lived the first part of their married life in the fashionable part of London at No. 3 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, in a flat overlooking the Thames. She lived very close to another Women's Rights campaigner, Sylvia Pankhurst, who lived down the road at No. 120 Cheyne Walk. In 1891, Florence and Charles Conybeare MP Camborne, Cornwall, moved to Tregullow House, Scorrier, Cornwall, a country pile owned by John Williams the 5th, a direct descendant of the Williams mining-moguls' dynasty. She remained there in Cornwall until at least 1902. The couple later moved to Oakfield Park in Dartford, Kent. Women's suffrage 1907: Women's Enfranchisement Bill NUWSS poster Florence Conybeare was an active organiser, supporter and voice within the Women's Suffrage movement. Yesterday's Town: Dartford, by Geoff Porteus, 1981. Florence Conybeare had supported Mr. W.H. Dickenson'sLiberal MP for St Pancras. Women's Enfranchisement Bill which received its first reading on 8 March 1907. Up till then, married women living in the same house were not regarded as 'joint owners' of that property in the eyes of the law. The Dickenson Bill proposed that husband and wife living under the same roof should both be considered as 'joint occupiers' of the property which, as a consequence, would give married women equal status with men and the right to vote. 1908: Women's Suffrage: A Liberal Principle In her ‚Äòtreatise‚Äô Some Objections Answered published in 1908, in which she claimed that \\"Women‚Äôs Suffrage is essentially a Liberal principle\\", Florence Conybeare (aka: Mrs C.A.V. Conybeare) wrote a reply to an article written by Edith Calkin,Edith Calkin's article \\"Votes for Women\\", published in The Commonwealth and Empire ReviewThe Commonwealth and Empire Review Vol. XIV, Sep. 1908. one of the women critics of Women's Suffrage. She rebuked Calkin for wanting to deny women political recognition and argued why women should be given the right to vote, and aired her objections to Edith Calkin's approach to women's rights. The inequities of legislation * Florence Conybeare referred to Mr Dickenson's 'Women's Suffrage Bill of 1907' [ed. Women‚Äôs Enfranchisement Bill], which, if passed, would treat married women as 'joint occupier' of a dwelling, and chided Calkin for ignoring recent legislative developments concerning Women's Suffrage. * Conybeare believed that all women should be eligible to vote, irrespective of any 'property qualification'. * It was not right that women who paid rates and taxes had no right to decide how money is spent; taxation and representation belonged together. * The Married Woman‚Äôs Property Act of 1882, she wrote, was \\"very unsatisfactory for women\\", especially given the fact that married woman typically ran 16-hour days multitasking for their husbands, and any savings a woman made while running a home were the property of her husband. * The Law of Divorce \\"treated men and women differently, making it far easier for a husband to divorce his wife than for a wife to rid herself of a bad husband\\". * She objected to married women being barred from voting in municipal elections. * Women should be allowed to vote so they can help run the country, and pointed to the \\"very active part\\" women have played in the country's political life, and said that the last General Election [ed. 1906] \\"had been fought as much by men as women\\", thanks to the Women's Liberal Associations and the Primrose League, whose work had been used by all the political parties. The plight of working women * Conybeare rebukes Calkin's claim that women's place is in the home, and for failing to address the issue of women's pay. * Conybeare defined 'sweated labour' as \\"a woman who is paid less than a man for the same work\\". * While highlighting the drudgery of working women, Conybeare asserted that \\"women of leisure have a duty to fight for the rights of the working woman\\". * She urged working women to unite and lobby for Women's Suffrage because it was not only for their own good, but also because it would \\"raise the status of working women\\", especially as \\"the status of the poorest class of male worker had vastly improved\\" once he had been granted the right to vote in 1884\\". 1913: Suffragist meeting at Dartford On 24 July 1913, a meeting of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was held in a meadow in Bullace Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss Muriel Matters, had been invited to address a gathering on the subject of votes for women. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction made it clear that they were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.Adapted from The Calm Before the Storm: Dartford 1900-1914, by Dr Mike Still, Curator of the Dartford Borough Museum, 2014, based on a newspaper article in the Dartford Chronicle & District Times, 1 August 1913. Speech: Australian vs. British suffragism Muriel Matters, who had been sentenced to a month in Holloway Prison for obstruction, having earlier chained herself to a grille in the House of Commons, arrived by car with her entourage, as part of a publicity tour around the area, termed a 'pilgrimage'. In her speech, she contrasted the situation in this country with that in Australia where women already had the vote [ed. in 1902, see Women's suffrage in Australia], pointing out that women in Britain were being treated in the same way as criminals, foreigners and lunatics, despite having to pay taxes. The journalist who reported on the event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any trouble if there was any. The only violence on the day of the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he felt ashamed that he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting. Civic work Voluntary Aid Detachment Florence Conybeare was actively engaged in Voluntary Aid Detachment work at Charing Cross Hospital, London. On 13 January 1916, when Lady Henry Grosvenor held a meeting at the new YMCA Hut at Dartford, Florence was present in VAD uniform. \\"Whatever she took up, Mrs Conybeare did thoroughly and with a will\\".Obituary in the Dartford Chronicle, March 1916. Fundraising for the Western Front Florence Conybeare was actively involved in fundraising in Dartford during the First World War. \\"As the grim reality developed in France, an appeal went out from Florence Conybeare, to 'all Florence's'. Her plan was to raise money to purchase and equip an ambulance which would be sent to the Western Front which would be used to move wounded British soldiers‚Äîreferred to as \\"the devoted sons of our Empire\\" on Florence's memorial stone‚Äîfrom the battlegrounds back to the field hospitals. Not only did she want this done, she wanted volunteers called \\"Florences\\" to \\"man\\" the ambulance in France! She managed to raise the money, but she never got her wish to man the ambulance with Florence's.Dartford and The Great War, Gethyn Rees, 1998, p. 18. Women's Liberal Association Florence was President of the Dartford Women's Liberal Association [ed. Federation], and had largely been responsible for the setting up and running of the Babies Club. Last days Florence Annie Conybeare's Memorial, 1916 Florence Conybeare died at her father's home in 2 West Bolton Gardens, Kensington, London, on 29 February 1916, aged 43.Florence's father, Gustave Strauss, died three months later on 5 June 1916. She left no issue. During the preceding 18 months, she had been in failing health, but no-one had anticipated her sudden demise from pneumonia. Her husband, Charles Conybeare, was unfortunately at Canterbury at the time.Death certificate, 29 February 1916, General Register Office, Southport, England. Florence was cremated and a memorial service was held for her in London. She was buried in the cemetery of St Mary the Virgin Church, Fryerning, Ingatestone, Essex, and lies close to Charles Conybeare's parents. Charles Conybeare had a large obelisk-shaped memorial erected in her memory, which is mounted upon a square stone plinth,Charles Conybeare followed Florence three years later, on 18 February 1919. His ashes lie in the same tomb as Florence's. and devised the following poignant inscription: Memorial Here rest the ashes of Florence Annie The beloved wife of Charles Augustus Vansittart Conybeare Late of 'Tregullow', Cornwall Who gave her life in devoted service to the gallant sons of our Empire She passed into immortality on February 29th 1916 aged 43 She is not dead Afterword On 18 August 1916, probate was granted on Florence Conybeare's will in London to her husband Charles A.V. Conybeare. Florence died a wealthy lady, leaving effects totalling ¬£5,392 6s 2d, which in today's money [2010] is equivalent to ¬£232,193.National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills & Administrations), 1861-1941.

Located at 7 Marqu√©s de Riscal St., the building (in Neo-Mud√©jar style) dates from 1893 and it was opened in 1894. The last game played in the fronton was played in 1919, after which it was used for several purposes. The venue is the last surviving 19th century Basque pelota fronton in Madrid. It was declared bien de inter√©s cultural on 27 January 2011., and it was fully renovated in 2019.  History  Beti Jai fronton, engraving from the 19th c. The fronton was begun to be built in 1893, with a budget of approximately 500 000 pesetas. It is due to a design by architect Joaqu√≠n Rucoba (1844-1919), author of the Plaza de toros de La Malagueta, the Mercado de Atarazanas and park in M√°laga, and the City Hall of Bilbao, among other works. It was the fourth infrastructure of these open features in Madrid at the end of the 19th century, in a time when the sport of Basque pelota reached a remarkable popularity in the Spanish capital.

She worked at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (1948‚Äì1964), Imperial College London (1964‚Äì1986) and the University of Buckingham (1986‚Äì1991). Her research focused on carbohydrate metabolism and the hormones involved in diabetes and obesity. Early life Anne Ethel Beloff was born in 1921 in Hampstead to Semion (Simon) Beloff (born Semion Rubinowicz) and Maria (Marie) Katzin. Her parents were of Russian‚ÄìJewish background, and her siblings included the historian Max Beloff, Baron Beloff, the psychologist John Beloff, the journalist Nora Beloff, and the politician Renee Soskin. She earned a degree in chemistry from University College London in 1942 before completing a PhD in the biochemistry of skin burns with Rudolph Peters at the University of Oxford. She visited Harvard Medical School in 1946 to perform research and returned to the UK in 1948. In the same year she married Ernst Boris Chain, a biochemist who had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945, and moved with him to Rome. Career Beloff- Chain worked at Italy's Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (National Institute of Health) with Chain from 1948 to 1964, and held the position of chief research scientist. Her research focused on carbohydrate metabolism and the mechanism of action of insulin in hormonal control of diabetes and obesity. One of her most significant discoveries was that levels of beta-cell-tropin, an insulin secretagogue hormone, were elevated in the blood of obese individuals. In 1964, Beloff-Chain and her husband were recruited by Imperial College London and her family returned to London, where she took up a biochemistry teaching post at Imperial College London. She was promoted to professor of biochemistry in 1983, but she decided to leave with her research team in 1985. A ¬£250,000 new laboratory was built and she became a professor at the University of Buckingham in 1986. At Buckingham, she received funding from the Clore Foundation to establish and head the Department of Biochemistry, where she worked until her death. Death and legacy She died on 2 December 1991 in Camden Town, in northwest London. She is best remembered for her significant discovery that levels of beta-cell-tropin, an insulin secretagogue hormone, were elevated in the blood of obese individuals.

Early life Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong was born in Kuala Lipis, a small town who had previously been an important location for the rubber industry, in the district of Lipis, Pahang state, Malaysia in 1954. In 1990, he secured an unprecedented license to develop 50 acres of land in Semenyih district near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, into a private garden-like, scenic memorial park. As a result, a new landmark called Nirvana Memorial Park, began to grace the landscape of Semenyih. The 797-acre memorial park has since become a prominent feature that gains a huge following and revolutionized the death care industry in Malaysia. With the ever-increasing demand for a graceful yet dignified final resting place, Nirvana Asia Group fledged into an unassailable leading position within a short span of time across the region, establishing a network of 12 local and 7 overseas branches. Business career He was first inspired to go into business when his father-in-law died in 1985. Tasked to choose a burial plot, he visited a cemetery managed by the local associations since at that time there were no private cemeteries in Malaysia. The awkwardness of having to walk around the overcrowded cemetery inspired him to do something about the lacklustre way of how the conventional cemeteries were managed.Triumphing Over The ‚ÄòImpossible‚Äô: Top 10 of Asia magazine.

He then continued his studies at the technical university in Brandenburg. Following his professor's recommendation, he started working at AEG as an engineer. In the development of electro-motors, he pioneered in the messing and testing of generators. In 1897, he began at Berliner Maschinenbau AG, where he developed the first rotor powered by electricity with cardanic suspension and with that the first external rotor motor.

Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839‚Äì1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross, is a description of the many plants discovered on the Ross expedition, which visited islands off the coast of the Antarctic continent, with a summary of the expedition itself, written by Joseph Dalton Hooker and published in parts between 1844 and 1859 by Reeve Brothers in London. Hooker sailed on HMS Erebus as assistant surgeon. The botanical findings of the Ross expedition were published in four parts, the last two in two volumes each, making six volumes in all: * Part I Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands (1843‚Äì45) * Part II Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc (1845‚Äì47) * Part III Flora of New Zealand (1851‚Äì53) (2 vols) * Part IV Flora of Tasmania (1853‚Äì59) (2 vols) All were \\"splendidly\\" illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch. The larger part of the plant specimens collected during this expedition are now part of the Kew Herbarium. Although Hooker professed not to have changed his views on Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, the Flora of Tasmania contains an introductory essay on biogeography written from a Darwinian point of view, making the book the first case study for the theory.  Context  The ships sailed through forests of Durvillea harveyi (now Durvillea antarctica) The British government fitted out an expedition led by James Clark Ross to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus on 29 September 1839 from Chatham. The ships docked at Madeira, Tenerife, the Cape Verde archipelago, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, Trinidad to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera was found off Marion Island, but no landfall could be made there or on the Crozet Islands due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all plants previously encountered by James Cook on the Kerguelen Islands were collected. On 20 July they sailed again to arrive on 16 August at the River Derwent, to remain in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at Lord Auckland's Islands and Campbell's Island for the spring months. Large floating forests of Macrocystis and Durvillaea were found until the ships run into the icebergs at latitude 61¬∞ S. Pack-ice was met at 68¬∞ S and longitude 175¬∞. During this part of the voyage Victoria Land, Mount Erebus and Mount Terror were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the Bay of Islands, and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect the plants. From 6 April 1842 a long stay in the Falklands began, where the flora was investigated to supplement the work of Admiral D‚ÄôUrville and of the crew of the Uranie. When visiting the Hermite Islands, seedlings of the deciduous Nothofagus antarctica and the evergreen Nothofagus betuloides were collected from this southernmost location of any tree. These were planted on the Falklands, and some were later brought to Kew. Other plants were also collected. On Cockburn‚Äôs Island twenty cryptogam species were found. The ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved. Reception Joseph Dalton Hooker gave Charles Darwin a copy of (a draft of) the Flora; Darwin thanked him, and agreed in November 1845 that the geographical distribution of organisms would be \\"the key which will unlock the mystery of species\\". The book remains important; for example, in 2013 W. H. Walton in his Antarctica: Global Science from a Frozen Continent describes it as \\"a major reference to this day\\", encompassing as it does \\"all the plants he found both in the Antarctic and on the sub-Antarctic islands\\", surviving better than Ross's deep-sea soundings which were made with \\"inadequate equipment\\".  Monograph  Fagus betuloides, now Nothofagus betuloides The four parts of the Flora Antarctica total 6 volumes, describe about 3000 species, and contain 530 plates which figure 1095 of the species.  Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands  Part I, published between 1843 and 1845, covers the Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands. It has 208 pages, 370 species, 80 plates and map, and figures 150 species.  Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc.  Part II, published between 1845 and 1847, covers the Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc. It has 366 pages, 1000 species, 120 plates, and figures 220 species. According to Hooker, the flora of New Zealand's Antarctic islands is so different from that of the remainder of the territories visited during the voyage, that it merits a separate description. An exemplary difference is the dominance of Asteraceae in New Zealand's islands, and absence of representatives of the Rubiaceae, while the reverse is true for those two plant families on the other Antarctic archipelagos. So the Flora Antarctica describes in its second part the plants of Tierra del Fuego and the south-western coast of Patagonia, the Falkland Islands, Palmer's Land, South Shetlands, South Georgia, Tristan da Cunha, and Kerguellen's Land. Flora Novae-Zelandiae Part III, the Flora of New Zealand or Flora Nova- Zelandiae, was published in two volumes between 1851 and 1853. * Volume 1 Phanerogams (355 pages, 730 species, 70 plates, 83 species figured) * Volume 2 Cryptogams (378 pages, 1037 species, 60 plates, 230 species figured)  Flora Tasmaniae  Part IV, the Flora of Tasmania or Flora Tasmaniae was published in two volumes between 1853 and 1859. * Volume 1 Dicotyledones (550 pages, 758 species, 100 plates, 138 species figured) * Volume 2 Monocotyledones and Acotyledones (422 pages, 1445 species, 100 plates, 274 species figured) Hooker dedicated this Part to the local naturalists Ronald Campbell Gunn and William Archer, noting that \\"This Flora of Tasmania .. owes so much to their indefatigable exertions\\". Although the book is sometimes stated to have been published in 1859, the dedication is dated January 1860. It made use of plants collected by the local naturalist Robert Lawrence as well as Gunn and Archer. The book begins with an \\"Introductory Essay\\" on biogeography. It is followed by a \\"Key to the Natural Orders of Tasmanian Flowering Plants\\" and a more detailed key to the genera. The Flora proper begins with the first order, the Ranunculaceae. Flora Tasmaniae was \\"the first published case study supporting Charles Darwin‚Äôs theory of natural selection\\". It contained a \\"milestone essay on biogeography\\", \\"one of the first major public endorsements of the theory [of evolution by natural selection]\\". Hooker gradually changed his mind on evolution as he wrote up his findings from the Ross expedition. While he asserted that \\"my own views on the subjects of the variability of existing species\\" remain \\"unaltered from those which I maintained in the 'Flora of New Zealand'\\", the Flora Tasmaniae is written from a Darwinian perspective that effectively assumes natural selection, or as Hooker named it, the \\"variation\\" theory, to be correct.

Apart from a strip of the north and west of the main island, where crops such as potatoes are grown with irrigation, the land is arid. With a very hot dry summer, a mild winter, and brackish groundwater, the plants need adaptations in order to survive. Nevertheless, 196 species of higher plant have been recorded here, as well as about seventeen species of terrestrial mammals, many birds and reptiles, and many migratory birds visit the islands in autumn and spring. Geography The Socotra cormorant breeds on the Hawar Islands Bahrain is a group of islands on the western side of the Persian Gulf, approximately halfway between Saudi Arabia, to the west and Qatar, to the east. Bahrain Island is the largest island and is long by wide. It consists of a low plain with a central hill, the Mountain of Smoke, the highest point of which is above sea level. There are five further small islands and many islets. To the north lies the Persian Gulf, and to the south and west lies the Gulf of Bahrain, which has two connections to the Persian Gulf, one either side of Bahrain. Also part of Bahrain are the Hawar Islands, which lie close to the coast of Qatar and are about southeast of the main islands. These were designated in 1997 as a Ramsar site, a wetland habitat of international importance for wildlife. The climate is very hot in summer and rather cooler in winter, with an average temperature of in August and in January. Precipitation averages and falls in small amounts in winter. The terrain is predominantly arid and agriculture is only possible on eight percent of the land area. Water is extracted from the Dammam Aquifer but this is becoming increasingly brackish and desalination plants are increasingly being used to provide fresh water. Environmental issues Environmental problems in Bahrain include droughts, dust storms, the degradation of arable land, the desertification of the coastline and rising sea levels associated with global warming. Flora and fauna 195 species of higher plant have been recorded on the islands. 17 species of terrestrial mammal are found here as well as 14 species of reptile, a single species of amphibian and 54 species of fish. Many migratory birds visit the islands and 14 species of breeding bird have been recorded, of which 6 species are classified as \\"threatened\\". The only protected area in the country is the Al Areen Wildlife Park in Sakhir, a nature reserve and zoo. It was established in 1976 and covers a total area of . Tree of Life The north and west of the main island is where date palms, citrus trees and alfalfa are cultivated. In this irrigated region, many species of plant grow that are not present in the arid conditions prevailing elsewhere, where vegetation is more sparse. The Tree of life is a lone Prosopis cineraria tree some 400 years old growing on the site of an ancient fort, surrounded by desert. The soils on the coast are home to salt-tolerant plants, many of which can secrete salt from glands on their surfaces. One of the commonest of these is the dwarf shrub Zygophyllum qatarense, which has many adaptations to suit the harsh environment. Further inland, perennial plants adapt to arid conditions by being dwarf or prostrate, being deciduous, having deep root systems, reducing their leaf surface area, and having thorns and hairs. Annual plants appear when rain falls, and pass through an accelerated life cycle to flower and set seed in a few weeks. The largest terrestrial mammal in Bahrain is the sand gazelle, over two hundred of which are resident on the privately owned island of Umm an Nasan, and others are present on Bahrain Island and the Hawar Islands. Other mammals include the Arabian hare, the desert hedgehog, the long-eared hedgehog and the Indian grey mongoose. The lesser Egyptian jerboa is a nocturnal desert resident, and bats living in Bahrain include the trident bat, naked-rumped tomb bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle and R√ºppell's pipistrelle, though the latter has not been recorded in Bahrain since 1984. In close proximity to human habitations are found the black rat, brown rat, house mouse and Asian house shrew. About 340 species of bird have been recorded in Bahrain, the majority being migrants on their way southwards in autumn and northwards in spring. There are a range of habitats to which they are attracted including cultivated areas, open countryside, marshes, mudflats and mangrove swamps. Visiting wetland birds include sandpipers, curlews and plovers, and the mangrove areas are favoured by egrets, herons, flamingoes, terns and gulls. By contrast, the Hawar Islands have fewer habitat types and only about 60 migratory species have been recorded here. Many of these are seabirds and after the spring migrants have departed northwards, the breeding birds start to arrive. The Hawar Islands have been designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International. The main trigger species are the western reef heron, Socotra cormorant, white-cheeked tern, Saunders's tern and the Sooty falcon. It is also an important wintering area for the great crested grebe and the greater flamingo. Goitered gazelle and Arabian oryx have been reintroduced to the Hawar Islands. The sea around the islands has extensive areas of seagrass and algae, and supports a variety of marine life including sea turtles and the largest aggregation of dugongs outside Australia. The extensive coral reefs around Bahrain are composed of coral species with a tolerance of high temperatures and high salinity levels. Nevertheless, some corals experienced bleaching in the summers of 1996 and 1998, and coral reefs in the area have been destroyed by dredging and by the increased level of sedimentation this causes.

Bourgeois became notable after her death for her relationship with the British businessman and politician Geoffrey Robinson, who was the recipient of a ¬£12.75 million trust fund established by Bourgeois. Early years Bourgeois's father was a diplomat who had become wealthy through importing jewels, carpets and furniture from Iran. Bourgeois had a sister, and their father gave them gifts of gold until they possessed their exact weight in gold on Bourgeois's 26th birthday. Differing accounts exist of Bourgeois's activities during World War II. Bourgeois was reported to have hidden British soldiers as a member of the Belgian resistance, or that she passed information about the Nazis to Belgian freedom fighters while working as a waitress in a cafe frequented by German officers. It has also been stated that Bourgeois drove an ambulance during the war, and was decorated for her bravery at the conclusion of the war. Bourgeois was at one point married to George Buydendyk, the former European chief executive of tyre manufacturers Goodyear. Jaguar and Toyota In 1947, Bourgeois met a Canadian soldier, and persuaded him to take her to England, where she went to the house of Jaguar Cars co-founder William Lyons. Bourgeois subsequently negotiated a five-year agreement to sell Jaguars in Belgium, under the auspices of her newly created Anglo-Belgian Motor Company, and would sell between 400-500 Jaguars annually for the next twenty years. In 1973, British Leyland, the owners of Jaguar, planned to end all contracts with foreign distributors of Jaguars without compensation, and Bourgeois went to Coventry to meet with executives from the company. Bourgeois met Geoffrey Robinson, an executive at Leyland, and he would subsequently help her negotiate distribution agreements with Toyota, who had replaced Jaguar as Bourgeois's primary income. By 1979 Bourgeois's International Motor Company owned the franchises to sell Toyota and Daihatsu cars and Bridgestone tyres in Belgium, and Robinson advised her during the negotiations over the sale of the company for ¬£14.6 million to Inchcape that year. Later years Bourgeois became a tax exile after the sale of her company, and never returned to her native Belgium, moving to Geneva in the tax haven of Switzerland. Bourgeois spent her summers in Cannes, on the Cote d'Azur in the south of France, where she owned a 400sq m penthouse apartment on the Avenue Hesperides. In 1993 Bourgeois bought Marshcourt, a Grade I listed Arts and Crafts style country house near Stockbridge, Hampshire, designed by Edwin Lutyens. Bourgeois bought Marshcourt for ¬£630,000, but allowed Robinson to appear as the owner of the house. Bourgeois provided the collateral to help Robinson gain a ¬£100,000 loan from Credit Suisse that he required to start the electronics company TransTec in 1981. Bourgeois's companion towards the end of her life was the Algerian Saad Boudamagh. Bourgeois invested ¬£500,000 in an Algerian sweet factory for Boudamagh. Bourgeois's jewellery collection, which she had estimated was worth $10 million, was donated to the Pasteur Institute after her death, and eventually sold at auction at Christie's in 1995 for $700,000. Bourgeois died in Cannes in 1994, and was worth an estimated ¬£35 million at her death. Her fortune was divided between Robinson and Boudamagh; Robinson also inherited all her property. Her funeral was held at the L'Eglise Saint-Lambert in Brussels. In November 1997 it was revealed by Chris Blackhurst in an article for the Independent on Sunday that Robinson had been a discretionary beneficiary of a ¬£12.75 million offshore trust for him and his family established by Bourgeois, called Orion, based in the tax haven of Guernsey. In 2000 the trust was reported have been worth ¬£38 million.

CEMO is a research unit and has its expertise within psychometrics, international large- scale assessments (ILSA) such as Programme for International Student Assessment and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, competency measurement and statistics. The aim of the centre is to produce high level of scientific research, as well as to advise the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research and the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training.  Mission  CEMO‚Äôs mission is, firstly, to move the field of educational measurement forward. This includes an orientation towards action such as the development of instruments that balance educational quality, equity, and effectiveness, but also towards reaction such as addressing concerns about unintended consequences and side-effects of assessments by examining these in-depth. A special objective of CEMO is to contextualize educational assessments in the societal and cultural characteristics of the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), with the intention to ‚Äúunpack‚Äù the Nordic model. Secondly, CEMO‚Äôs mission is to cover the full cycle of educational measurement including research on a theory- driven definition of how to assess constructs, on the development of appropriate instruments to observe these constructs, on ways to collect, code, and score observations, on how to model the data, and on reporting and communication of results. A special feature of CEMO is the combination of basic research in the field of educational measurement with applications of advanced measurement techniques to educational problems. CEMO‚Äôs third mission is to bring substantive and methodological experts together to work on an integrated approach to educational measurement. Measurement in education is inherently challenging given the complexity of constructs, diversity of populations, and the potential within- and between-population differences of the constructs that we attempt to measure. Interdisciplinary collaboration is therefore a fruitful way to overcome these challenges and, as such, is a goal of CEMO. Finally, CEMO strives to address research or methods biases by considering many different outcomes (cognitive, socio-emotional, long-term), taking quality and quantity of contexts and processes into account (opportunities to learn, student characteristics, and resources), using different types of instruments (paper- and pencil tests, performance assessments, technology-based assessments) and by covering a wide range of target populations (early childhood, primary and secondary education, higher education, adults).  Research  The CEMO researchers publish widely in international journals, including Journal of Educational Measurement, Intelligence, Journal of the American Medical Association, Psychometrica, Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research and others.  Activities  CEMO holds ongoing brown bag seminars that are open to the campus community. In addition the center holds a number of high-profile talks each semester from leading researchers from around the world.  Teaching  Members from CEMO teach course in statistics, research methods, assessment and educational policy.

It instructs users to add one of the blue packets of powdered material each month. Pit additives is a commercially-produced material that aims to reduce fecal sludge build-up and control odor in pit latrines, septic tanks and wastewater treatment plants. Manufacturers claim to use effective microorganisms (EM) in their products. Current scientific evidence does not back up most claims made by manufacturers about the benefits. Removing sludge continues to be a problem in pit latrines and septic tanks. Background Pit additives are advocated for use in sanitation systems like pit latrines and septic tanks. Additives consist of packages of micro-organisms or enzymes or both. More than 1,200 septic system additives were estimated to be available in the U.S. in 2011. However, very little peer-reviewed and replicated field research exists to confirm the efficacy of biological additives. Claimed benefits Pit additive claims include an increase in speed of the breakdown of sludge, which may also decrease odor. The claim is based on assertions that the additive contains nutrients or certain aerobic (oxygen-breathing) micro- organisms that will break down the sludge. Research, however, finds that these claims are unlikely to be true.Grolle, K. (2015) Laboratory investigations into solids solubilisation of black water and faecal matter: Effect of additives and internal physical chemical pit latrine aspects, Department of Environmental Technology and Research, University of Wageningen, Wageningen, The Netherlands The amount of bacteria introduced by pit additives is insignificant compared to the bacteria already present in the pit or septic tank.  Applications  Septic tanks  Researchers from the U.S. carried out field experiments in 2011 to assess the effect of additives on the performance of 20 septic tanks.S. Pradhan, Michael T. Hoover, G.H. Clark, M. Gumpertz, C. Cobb, J. Strock (2011) Impacts of biological additives; Part 2 Septic Tank Effluent Quality and Overall Additive Efficacy, Journal of Environmental Health, Volume 74, Number 5, p. 22-28 These septic tanks served residences at a mobile home park located in Orange County, North Carolina. The researchers distinguished between tanks that were well maintained, poorly maintained and maintained to an intermediate level. \\"Well maintained\\" was defined as \\"de-sludged in the last 2-3 years.: \\"Poorly maintained\\" had not been de-sludged for the last 15-20 years. Tanks put in the intermediate category fell somewhere in between. Only well-maintained septic tanks showed some reduction in sludge build-up. To determine if the reduction could be attributed to pit additives, a follow up-study investigated the impact of three additives on just the well-maintained septic tanks. Overall, the research concluded there was limited evidence of additive impact on the performance of septic tanks. It should be stressed that these field experiments used additives other than EM (effective microorganisms), leaving the results open to the argument that the more varied composition of EM could make such additives more effective than the three additives tested. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) produced a fact sheet on the use of pit additives to improve the performance of septic tank treatment systems.EPA 625/R-00/008 Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems Special Issues Fact Sheet 1 - Septic Tank Additives The fact sheet concludes that bacteria and extracellular enzymes do not appear to significantly enhance normal biological decomposition processes in septic tanks. They go on to say that ‚Äòsome biological additives have been found to degrade or dissipate septic tank scum and sludge. However, whether this relatively minor benefit is derived without compromising long-term viability of the soil infiltration system has not been demonstrated conclusively‚Äô. They noted that some studies suggest that material degraded by additives in the tank actually adds to the suspended solids and other contaminants in the otherwise clarified septic tank effluent. Wastewater treatment plants Proponents claim the additives in wastewater can facilitate reduction in organic load and pathogen removal, leading to significant improvements in effluent quality. They also claim benefits relating to the rate of sludge build-up and odor reduction. One source claims that septic tank additives can reduce hydrogen sulphide and ammonia production. Their reasoning is that additives contain natural‚Äô organisms that prevail over the rather less ‚Äònatural‚Äô organisms that would otherwise dominate conditions in the treatment unit, whether this be a septic tank or some form of aerobic treatment. They even claim that by overcoming the effects of ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô substances such as bleach and other disinfectants, the use of septic tank additives allows septic tanks and other treatment systems to function in conditions that would otherwise have resulted in their becoming ‚Äòdead‚Äô and non-functional. One short note claims that microorganisms in the additives contain various organic acids due to the presence of lactic acid bacteria. These secrete organic acids, enzymes antioxidants, and metallic chelates thus create an antioxidant environment, which assists in the enhancement of solid-liquid separation, which is the foundation for cleaning water.Higa, T. & Chinen, N. 1998, ‚ÄòEM Treatments of Odor, Waste Water, and Environmental Problems‚Äô, College of Agriculture, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. The authors of the note provide no explanation of how this works. However, the findings from various studies around the world indicate that: * There is no reliable evidence that addition of pit additives to wastewater prior to treatment has a significant effect on pathogen concentrations. * The evidence on the effect of pit additives on settleability of solids and reduction in effluent BOD and suspended solids is mixed. Under some circumstances, it appears that adding pit additives can have some effect on both BOD and SS concentrations but the effect is not large and is not proven. * The available evidence suggests that any lasting effect of pit additives is dependent on regular application of the microorganisms combined with good maintenance of the treatment technology. This will require (a) a reliable supply chain for the pit additive and (b) management systems that ensure that the pit additive is added regularly and on schedule. While pit additives can lead to some improvement in effluent quality, it is unlikely that the improvement would be enough to make a difference. Claims that pit additives can make otherwise ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô effluents ‚Äòsafe‚Äô is unlikely to be justified. Costs Based on the research conducted so far, spending money on pit additives is a waste of money. In 2011, one fifth of South African municipalities purchased various additives as part of their sanitation management programmes. Even at that time the Water Research Commission in South Africa advised against this practice. Instead they suggested spending that money on improved pit emptying methods and improved pit design, which might include use of low flush toilets with alternating leach pits.Still, D., O‚ÄôRiordan, M. (2012). Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines - Volume 3: The development of pit emptying technologies. WRC Report No. 1745/1/12, , Water Research Commission, South Africa The costs and health risks associated with manual pit emptying are significant. If an EM product could be developed to significantly reduce the filling rate of pits, this would be of enormous significance.  Examples   Australia  Australian scientists investigated the effect of additives in a wastewater treatment plant and a number of septic tanks. Their aim was to test the hypothesis that the additive reduces sludge volumes. They found significant reduction in pH levels at the wastewater treatment plant together with improved settlement of sludge but with a significant increase in organic matter (measured as biological oxygen demand). Their results for the septic tanks showed a homogenization of conditions in the tanks after application of septic tank additives, which they suggested was due to domination by a particular type of micro-organism. However, they found no reduction in suspended solids concentration in the effluent and concluded that there were not sufficient changes in sludge volume in the wastewater treatment plant or suspended solids in the septic tanks to indicate a clear benefit from the use of these kinds of additives in wastewater.  Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi, Pakistan  A project in Karachi, Pakistan called the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) has been making use of pit additives. The OPP promotes a treatment technology comprising a two- chamber tank. The first of these acts like the first compartment of a septic tank while the second is filled with gravel to provide filtration. It is not clear whether flow through the second compartment is upward or downward. This arrangement has some similarities to baffled reactor designs promoted by the German NGO BORDA, although standard BORDA designs provide more chambers, arranged in series and with all after the first chamber operating in an upward flow mode. The baffled reactor design is one of a number of ‚ÄòDEWATS‚Äô (decentralised wastewater treatment systems) wastewater treatment technologies promoted by BORDA. All operate anaerobically and are examples of what might be termed enhanced primary treatment. If maintained well, enhanced primary treatment modules should perform better than a well maintained conventional septic tank but will still produce an effluent with high pathogen levels and relatively high biological oxygen demand and suspended solids concentrations. The OPP is using the additives to improve the effluent produced at these small treatment plants, including the plant that treats effluent from a nursery in Karachi. It has also supported the installation of several small treatment plants using EM technology in rural Sindh and Punjab. Its partner organization Ali Hasan Mangi Memorial Trust (AHMMT) installed a small sewage treatment unit with additives to treat sewage from 300 houses in the village Khairodero in Larkana District. Another eleven are reported to be functioning and more are planned. During discussions at the Urban Resource Centre in Karachi in late 2011, the late Parveen Rehman of OPP stated that adding pit additives to the inlet chamber of these treatment facilities had resulted in improved effluent quality and a significant reduction in smell. However, it seems that OPP had not attempted to quantify the improvement and had not made any formal assessment of the effect of the pit additive on effluent quality.

The party elected a 5-member collective leadership (Andr√°s L√°nyi, agrarian engineer √âva √Åcs, architect Attila Ertsey, economist P√©ter Kajner and essayist Istv√°n Orosz).

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Events Numbers for 1976 were above average, however, the number of fatalities were significantly lower than normal. United States yearly total January 12 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. in January. February 36 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in February. March 180 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in March. The Chicago area received the most tornadoes ever recorded, including several F2 and F3 tornadoes. March 20‚Äì21 A major outbreak shifted into mainly Illinois and Indiana. The strongest tornadoes occurred in Illinois, including an F4 tornado in Sadorus, but one F4 tornado came very close to Lafayette, Indiana. More activity continued onto March 21 when the system moved across Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Overall, 66 tornadoes touched down, killing three and injuring 189. March 26 An F4 tornado killed one and injured four in Talihina, Oklahoma. An F5 tornado also caused extensive damage in Spiro, Oklahoma, killing two people and injuring 64. The rating of that tornado is disputed. The outbreak as a whole killed four and injured 89. April 113 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in April. April 11 Two weak tornadoes touched down in Tennessee and Arkansas. The Arkansas tornado on April 11, 1976 was investigated using regular 30 min interval GOES digital infrared data, rawinsonde observations, Doppler sounder records and radar summaries covering the 3 hour time period immediately preceding the touchdown of the tornado. Clouds associated with the tornado were compared to other clouds that were not associated with tornadoes. April 19 An F5 tornado hit Brownwood, Texas, injuring 11. The rating is disputed. The outbreak as a whole injured 13. May 155 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in May. June 169 tornadoes were reported in June in the U.S. June 13 One of the largest and most violent tornadoes ever recorded in Iowa moved in between the cities of Ames and Boone during the afternoon. The tornado began southwest of the small town of Luther, Iowa a little before 3:30 pm and moved north northeast. The tornado strengthened and grew larger (at some points, more than a mile wide) as it approached US 30 just east of the intersection of IA 17. The tornado turned toward the north with the small hamlet of Jordan, Iowa in the path. A small satellite F3 tornado formed on the southwest side of the main tornado and moved around the back side and to the east of the tornado around 3:40 pm before merging back with the parent storm north of Jordan by 3:50 pm. The small hamlet of Jordan was raked by the half-mile wide F5 tornado, destroying nearly everything in its wake. The parent tornado turned north-northwest before encountering outflow from a storm to its northwest and pushed the tornado to the east and a little south of east. An anticyclonic tornado (the second tornado image on post) formed to the east of the parent tornado and it went to the north following the parent storm about two miles to its east. It too felt the downburst winds from the northwest and was pushed to the east as well. The parent tornado began to shrink and weaken as it approached the Boone and Story County line northwest of Ames. The tornado lifted about four miles west of Gilbert, Iowa at 4:15 pm, but the storm was not through yet. The downburst winds that had pushed the tornado to the east were now rampaging the countryside in northern Story County around Gilbert northeastward to Story City, Iowa where more houses and farmsteads were damaged or destroyed by the strong straight line winds, although there were no deaths and only a few injuries. More than 60 homes, and over 300 farm buildings were hit and destroyed by the family of tornadoes and the downburst winds that followed. Theodore Fujita (creator of the Fujita Scale) said the damage was most likely the most severe and extreme he'd ever examined and also one of the most rare, referring to the anticyclonic F3 tornado that accompanied and mimicked the F5 tornado from the parent storm. At same time of the supercell that produced the Jordan tornado, another supercell formed, producing a mile-wide F4 wedge tornado near Lemont, Illinois and causing two fatalities and 23 injuries. The outbreak as a whole killed two and injured 35. June 29 An F4 tornado struck Alta, Illinois. There no casualties from this or any other tornado that day. July 84 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in July. August 38 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in August. September 35 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in September. October 11 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in October. November No tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in November, being a record low. November 13 (Australia) An estimated F3 tornado killed 2 people in Victoria, Australia. December 1 tornado was reported in the U.S. in December.

He was a prolific author and wrote many books on historical and other subjects. Life Early years Jean Guiraud was born in Quillan, Aude, on 24 June 1866, son of a teacher. His elder brother, Paul, became actively anti-clerical. Jean chose to support the Catholic church throughout his life. He studied at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. He obtained his agr√©gation in History and Geography in 1888, then spent three years in the French School in Rome, where he helped edit the Papal records of the 13th century. In 1892 he was appointed professor of history at the lyc√©e in Sens, Yonne. In 1895 he married Marguerite Petit de Julleville, who would give him ten children. In 1898 he was appointed professor at the University of Besan√ßon, taking the chair of History and Geography of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Journalism and politics In parallel to his teaching career Guiraud undertook historical research, and promoted free education. In 1903 he helped found the daily newspaper L‚Äô√âclair comtois. In 1905 he became chairman of the Doubs committee of Popular Liberal Action. From 1908 he was editor in chief of the Revue des questions historiques. In 1909 he founded his own newsletter, Dieu, patrie, Libert√© (God, Fatherland, Liberty). After two failures to be elected, Guiraud withdrew from politics and became chair of the Association of Family Heads of the departments of Doubs, Haute-Sa√¥ne and Territoire de Belfort. At the same time he organized a national union of family heads. Co-editor of La Croix At the end of 1916 Guiraud accepted the position of co-editor with father Georges Bertoye of the Assumptionist journal La Croix. He succeeded Jules Bouvattier, who had held this position since 1897. From 1921 he regularly wrote in the literary pages, where he criticized Fran√ßois Mauriac, Marcel Proust and Charles P√©guy, whom he detested. He had difficulty agreeing with the papal condemnation of the right-wing Action Fran√ßaise. As head of the Associations Catholiques de Chefs de Famille he supported the F√©d√©ration Nationale Catholique and advertised its meetings in his columns in La Croix. In the early 1920s there was heated debate between proponents of the repartition proportionelle scolaire, which would allow for state-supported religious schools, and the √©cole unique in which all state schools would be secular. The deputy Fran√ßois Albert became president of the Ligue de l'enseignement (Education League) shortly before being appointed Minister of Public Education in √âdouard Herriot's mainly Radical government in 1924. At the annual meeting of the Ligue de l'enseignement in Valence on 1 November 1924 Albert gave a speech in which he violently attacked the Jesuits. Guiraud described Albert as \\"uniting in his person the action of masonry and official action in national education\\". Guiraud said the √©cole unique was \\"a sectarian enterprise that aims at establishing the monopoly of the atheist state.\\" Guiraud avoided writing about the victory of the left-wing Popular Front in 1936. Eventually his disagreements with the Assumptionists were too great, and in November 1939 he resigned. Jean Guiraud died on 11 December 1953 in Saint- Martin-de-Br√©thencourt, Yvelines.

Because of this, he hides his identity, targets Babji, traps him with some comic tricks, introduces himself to Sailaja as a common man with Babji's help, and starts helping her and her family. In this process, they develop a bond, and Sailaja also starts loving him. However, Krishna's real agenda is completely different. He has been appointed by the commissioner (Murali Sharma) to catch Sailaja father Sastry. That is why he had made this entire plan. Meanwhile, Sailaja's grandmother collapses from a heart attack and wants to see her son Sastry, Krishna forces Sailaja to call her father. By giving an assurance, he makes her do so. However, his actual motive is to catch him. Sastry visits the hospital. When Krishna tries to arrest him, he listens to the good impression that Sailaja and her family are having on him, so he is not able to arrest him. Suddenly a CI (Brahmaji), who is an assistant to Krishna, enters the scene, surrounds Sastry, and reveals the entire truth regarding Krishna. Sastry escapes from there but is suddenly attacked by goons of Puchappa and Mallesh. He is seriously injured and goes into a coma. Krishna protects him and joins in the hospital, but when Sailaja comes to know Krishna's real motive, she starts hating him and asks him to never show his face. Things get upset between the couple, and they break up with each other. Soon after, Krishna starts a serious investigation to explore the hidden truth in which he comes to know that Sastry is an income tax officer. In a raid at Puchappa's house, he and his superior officer get a pendrive, which contains life secrets of Puchappa and Mallesh. The superior officer tries make a deal with Mallesh. Knowing this, Sastry keeps the pendrive under wrap. Because of this, Puchappa and Mallesh kill the superior officer, put the blame on Sastry, and they are after the pendrive and his family. The rest of the story is all about how Krishna protects Sailaja's family, proves her father's innocence, catches the culprits, and gets back his love.

The Dartmouth‚ÄìHarvard football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Dartmouth Big Green and Harvard Crimson. The series began in 1882 and is considered one of the fifteen oldest rivalries in College football. Since the formation of the Ivy League in 1954, the annual game has been a key decider in the crowning of the league's champion. Dartmouth has captured a league-record 19 Ivy League championships, while the Crimson have obtained 17 titles, tied for third-most. Furthermore, since the start of round-robin play, Harvard and Dartmouth have posted the first- and second-best league winning percentages at 0.628 and 0.606 respectively. The rivalry was initially dominated by Harvard, with the Crimson owning a spot among the predominant collegiate programs of the era, capturing 12 national championships (7 claimed) recognized by NCAA-designated major selectors, all won prior to 1920. As a result, the upstart Big Green were unable to score until 1900, or to win until 1903, which came at the dedication of Harvard Stadium. In 1908, Harvard's Johnny Cutler won the game in the last few minutes. Dartmouth entered its own dominant period beginning in 1934, winning 15 of 19 contests, including their first victory at home in Hanover in 1955. The two teams entered a hotly-contested few decades of games, before Harvard seized the advantage in the late 1990s, winning an unprecedented 20 of 21 games. However, Dartmouth's recent resurgence in 2010s have led to several league championships and victories over Harvard, including a dramatic finish in the 2019 contest. Trailing 6 to 3 and needing a victory to keep their championship hopes alive, the Big Green's Derek Kyler connected with Masaki Aerts on a game-concluding Hail Mary pass, sealing a 9-6 victory.

Consolidated and the six remaining firms, all headquartered in New York City, were located within a few blocks of one another. Consolidated and its six corporate sponsors were defendants named in a Sherman Antitrust suit filed August 3, 1920, by the US Justice Department in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff was represented by Henry Anderson Guiler (1877‚Äì1938), Assistant U.S. District Attorney.  Sherman Antitrust suit  United States v. Consolidated Music Corporation, et al. was the first Sherman Antitrust case involving the music publishing industry. The petition was a complaint about monopoly pricing of piano rolls. In particular, the complaint charged that Consolidated had fixed the price charged to piano roll manufacturers for the right to manufacture and sell copyrighted compositions, and also had fixed the price at which those player rolls were sold to the public. The complaint averred that the seven named defendants controlled 80% of copyrighted musical compositions and 95% of player word roll market in the United States. Word rolls, essentially, were piano rolls with the lyrics printed in the margins. Consolidated held the word rights from published music that were printed on word rolls, and imposed a fee for use of those words on the rolls. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border:0px solid white; color: black; background-color: white; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" |-valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" Consolidated Music Corporation 144 West 37th Street style=\\"text-align:left\\" between 6th & 7th Avenues |-valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" Edgar Franklin Bittner (1877‚Äì1939), president (executive at Leo Feist, Inc.) style=\\"text-align:left\\"-valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" Henry Waterson (1873‚Äì1933), secretary  |-valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" Jack Bliss, vice president & general manager  |-valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" |colspan=\\"3\\"\\\\---- |-valign=\\"center\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" 1.Irving Berlin, Inc. 1567 Broadway style=\\"text-align:left\\" between 46th & 47th Streets |-valign=\\"center\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" 2.Leo Feist, Inc. 231 West 40th Street style=\\"text-align:left\\" between 7th & 8th Avenues |-valign=\\"center\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" 3.T.B.

Within two weeks of opening in 1920, faced with the likelihood of defeat, Consolidated closed its doors, withdrew the contract, and quickly thereafter, dissolved the corporation. On March 29, 1922, U.S. District Judge Augustus Noble Hand (1869‚Äì1954) dismissed the case. The licensing of piano rolls was eventually assigned to the Music Publishers Protective Association. Still, the licensing strategy endured by individual companies, yet was not highly successful, namely because consumers didn't want to pay extra for the words. By the end of 1920, sales of melody rolls, minus the words, offered by competitors, had done well in comparison to word rolls, which had fallen noticeably. By contrast, in a subset market, there had been an inverse public response with respect to the sale of phonograph records. Recorded dance music, without vocal, sold well, mainly because the public preferred to pay an extra 20 or 25 cents to acquire a roll with the words, along with the melody, permitting its use for dancing (without the words) or vocalizing around the piano (with the words).  Selected personnel  Jack Bliss (n√© George Homer Bliss; 1887‚Äì1956), a pianist and founding vice-president and general manager of the Consolidated Music Corporation, resigned in April 1920, to work for the Aeolian Company. He resigned when Consolidated withdrew its proposed contract from the music roll manufacturers and turned back the word roll rights to the publications of six of the music publishing firms. In January 1920, Bliss had left QRS Records, as general manager for the East. to join Consolidated. According to the U.S. Census, Bliss was managing director a hotel in 1930 and 1940, while living in Larchmont, New York. By 1947, Bliss was manager of the Sarasota Terrace Hotel, Sarasota, Florida. Bliss' son-in-law, George Edward Trafton (1896‚Äì1971), married to his daughter Jacqueline (1917‚Äì1989), was a former pro football player.

She was awarded the Medal of Honor from the National Society of New England Women. Life and career Born in Wellfleet, Massachusetts to Captain Simeon and Martha Burtee Atwood, Atwood was part of a family with a long association with Seafaring and the Cape Cod community. She attended Lasell Seminary for Young Women (now Lasell College) before pursuing studies in Italy, France, and Belgium. She later became a pupil of Arthur Wilson in Boston. Atwood made her professional opera debut in Siena and was actively performing in opera houses in the Italian provinces prior to World War I. With the outbreak of World War I, she returned to the United States and began a career as a leading soprano in Boston, making her first appearance in that city at the Boston City Club. She went on to appear in concert with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and for performances at the Boston Opera House. On November 16, 1926 Atwood made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Liu in the United States premiere of Giacomo Puccini's Turandot, and was one of the earliest exponents of that role. She performed that role 9 times at the Met, and also performed the role for the work's Philadelphia debut at the Academy of Music. She continued at the Met through 1930 with her final performance there being Nedda in Pagliacci. In 1927 she portrayed the title role in Puccini's Tosca with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company. That same year she performed at the American Legion Convention in Paris. She was also active as a recitalist, performing in such venues as Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, and New York's Gallo Theater among others. In 1938 Atwood founded the Cape Cod Institute of Music which she continued to lead until 1943. She was married three times during her life. Her first marriage to Reuben Baker ended in divorce in 1927; as did her second to baritone Alessandro Alberini in 1935. Her third marriage to Manufacturers Trust Company Vice President George R Baker ended upon his death in 1944. Atwood died at Cape Cod Hospital in 1950 at the age of 63.

Believed to be connected to drug trafficking activity in the favela despite having no prior involvement in illegal activity, de Souza was brought in for questioning during Operation Armed Peace, during which roughly 300 officers from Rocinha's UPP force flooded the favela in order to arrest drug traffickers. It was during this two-day long raid that de Souza was brought to the police station and never seen again. According to police testimony, de Souza was released after questioning in the UPP base in Rocinha. Cameras show de Souza being taken into the base, yet all cameras and GPS systems belonging to the UPPs suspiciously malfunctioned upon his supposed release, providing no evidence as to his whereabouts after the questioning. A skeleton found in Resende, Brazil on September 27, 2013 was examined to determine if it was the body of de Souza, but the results were inconclusive. To date, de Souza's body has not been found. Investigation According to initial police reports, de Souza was released after questioning. De Souza was classified as ‚Äúmissing‚Äù for more than two months after his disappearance, but public outrage eventually grew to force authorities to respond to the suspicious circumstances of his disappearance. By October 2013, twenty-four policemen and UPP commander Edson Santos were accused of torture, concealing a body, procedural fraud, and conspiracy. Four officers had a direct role in de Souza's disappearance and subsequent torture, twelve stood guard, and eight were present but failed to help the victim. Major Santos was found to have bribed a Rocinha resident, Lucia Helena da Silva Batista, to lie in her eyewitness testimony of what happened to de Souza, linking the murder to a local drug trafficker rather than the military police. To date, de Souza's body has not been found. It was determined that de Souza was tortured with electric shocks and suffocated with plastic bags for more than two hours before he was drowned in a bucket. In June 2015, it was announced that investigations into de Souza's disappearance in response to new images from security cameras close to the UPP station in Rocinha. The goal of the reopened investigation is to determine why BOPE (Batalh√£o de Opera√ß√µes Policiais Especiais, a special unit of the military police trained extensively in urban warfare to combat drug gangs) entered Rocinha on the night of de Souza's disappearance. While initial analysis of the images obtained of the BOPE trucks was inconclusive, computer enhanced imaging determined that a volume compatible with that of a human corpse was sealed in a motorcycle cover and placed in one of the BOPE trucks. It was determined that de Souza was tortured with electric shocks and suffocated with plastic bags for more than two hours before he was drowned in a bucket. In the city of Rio, roughly 16% of all registered homicides between 2010 and 2015 took place by the hands of on-duty police officers. As of April 2015, 183 of 220 investigations into police killings were still open, and only one case led to the indictment of a police officer. In this context, de Souza's case became a symbol of the fight against police abuse. ‚ÄúWhere is Amarildo?‚Äù served as the rallying call of protesters, with #WhereIsAmarildo and #OndeEstaoAmarildo used extensively on social media. Controversy De Souza's case is controversial in that twenty-five UPP officers were charged with torture followed by death. The UPPs were first established in 2008 in Santa Marta as a method to increase security in anticipation of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games. They were created to wrest control of the favelas from gangs and militias back to the Brazilian government, effectively integrating favela residents into the formal city The design of the UPPs addresses the issue of rampant police brutality and corruption in Rio by using only fresh recruits recently graduated from police academy and giving special training in human rights issues. However, despite the successful pacification of favelas with UPPs installed, the relationship between favela residents and UPPs is often marked by mutual distrust. In one study, interviewed favela residents reported concern over the possibility that the UPPs would become the ‚Äúnew boss‚Äù of the favela, replacing the ousted gang leaders and controlling the favelas without integrating them into the city as promised by the government. Among the criticisms of the UPPs is the allegation that they possibly have a role in the rising number of missing persons in pacified favelas, a concern highlighted by de Souza's disappearance in 2013. The number of homicides per 100,000 people in Rio fell from 6122 in 2007 to 4030 in 2012, and the rate of resistance killings by police decreased by 51.5% in pacified favelas. At the same time, the number of missing persons in Rio's pacified favelas and its impoverished peripheral communities increased by 33 percent since 2007, one year before the creation of the UPPs. Proponents of the UPPs argue that the rise in non-lethal crimes ‚Äì including unsolved disappearances ‚Äì is a consequence of better reporting: it is possible that disappearances that occurred prior to pacification went unreported due to fear of revenge by gang members. On the other hand, critics of the program argue that Rio's police forces have an interest in not reporting ‚Äúresistance killings,‚Äù defined by Amnesty International as ‚Äúkillings by on-duty police which are legitimized on the grounds of self-defense‚Äù. Because the state gives monetary bonuses to UPPs for killing fewer people in an effort to reverse the culture of violence prevalent in Rio's police forces, it is possible that police dispose of evidence related to resistance killings before an official investigation can occur. Between 2005 and 2014, 8,466 cases of killings by police were recorded in the state of Rio de Janeiro. While this overall rate began to fall in 2010, there was a 39.4 percent increase in resistance killings in Rio de Janeiro state between 2013 and 2014. As global scrutiny is placed on Brazil's social maladies and the state's response to them in anticipation of the 2016 Olympic Games, critics of the UPPs purport that police forces are disguising resistance killings as disappearances in order to improve public perception.

The original material is housed by the Archives Services Center (ASC) of the library of the University of Pittsburgh with digitized material available at the Darlington Digital Library. The collection was inherited by Darlington's daughters Mary O'Hara Darlington and Edith Darlington. The donation of the collection was first given to the University of Pittsburgh in 1918. The rest of the collection was donated in 1925.  History  An engraving depicting the evening council of George Washington at Fort NecessityWilliam Darlington was an attorney from Pittsburgh and spent much of his life collecting maps, books, magazines, and manuscripts. Some of these date back to the 1500s. The earliest maps of the New World are also part of the collection Devoted much of his 74 years to collecting some of the earliest printed maps of the New World. Both William and Mary researched and published about the French and Indian War and to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley thereby acquiring a large amount of material on the subjects. Mr. Darlington died in 1889, his wife Mary, continued to acquire materials since she also had an interest in history and art. The Darlington's children, son O‚ÄôHara and daughters Mary and Edith, also added to the family collection. This family's interest in historical materials resulted in what was then believed to be the largest private library west of the Alleghenies. In 1918, they gave their initial donation of eleven thousand volumes to the University of Pittsburgh. The remainder of the family's library and a large part of the family's estate was bequeathed to the university in 1925. An endowment was given to the university of one million dollars to maintain the collection. The memorial entrance vestibule to the former library space that once housed the Darlington Collection and now serves as the university's Humanities Center From 1936 to 2009, the collection was housed in special library space on the sixth floor of the main building of the university, the Cathedral of Learning. This space was constructed and furnished with antiques that were bequeathed to the university by the Darlington family, and features moldings and green walls that are duplicated from the 18th mansion Graeme Park, a Pennsylvania colonial-era governor‚Äôs residence. The library was entered through a memorial vestibule and consisted of a central room with eight alcoves and contained, among other notable furnishings, a wrought iron entrance gate by Samuel Yellin. Beginning in 2006, the university began to digitize the materials of the collection and place them online at the Darlington Digital Library. The original, sometimes fragile, materials of the library were placed in storage for availability to researchers upon request. In 2009, following digitization and protective storage of the library's materials, the space was renovated by architect Rob Pfaffmann in order to house the university's Humanities Center which, while retaining much of the original character and furnishings, now includes office space for staff and visiting fellows.  Scope of the collection  The focus of the collection is on early American history and literature, and also includes rare maps and atlases, works on ornithology and natural history, and early travel narratives. O'Hara Darlington also contributed his collections of Victorian literature, sporting books, and works of illustrators and caricaturists. Since the Darlington's donation, the collection has been added to through gifts by other individuals and organizations, particularly its content on the history of Western Pennsylvania.  Photographs  Edith Darlington The photographic collection icontains 154 photographs taken by Edith Dennison Darlington Ammon and O'Hara Darlington taken around and in the family home in Guyasuta and the nearby community. The photographs span the years from 1885 through 1888. The photographs are bound in five albums. They recorded family, friends, and leisure activities. These photographs by Edith and O'Hara are noted for their artistic approach to photography. Edith and O'Hara were active members of the Pittsburgh Amateur Photographers‚Äô Society. The organization also was a social club and was established in May 1885.  Books  The Darlingtons assembled many scrapbooks of materials that they had collected.  Personal and business papers  Darlington collected personal letters authored by General James O'Hara to his wife and contemporaries that describe the conditions of Fort Pitt in the 1790s. One of these includes a description of the colonists' interactions with the surrounding Native American tribes. Some papers document the business dealings of James O'Hara's land from 1785. General James O'Hara's diary is part of the collection and documents his opinions on immigration and glassworks that he built.  Atlases and maps  1630 map by Hendrik Hondius I that is part of the Darlington Digital Library Included in the collection are thirty-six rare maps, eight of which show various iterations of the world, including Gerhard Mercator‚Äôs world view created in 1613. Some maps are large and unbound. Others are included in rare books. These maps were part of a June 12, 2015 exhibition at Hillman Library conducted to commemorate the 200th anniversary of William Darlington‚Äôs birth on May 1, 1815.  Lithographs  Historical lithographs illustrating buildings and people are part of the collection.  Art  The ASC presented content from the Darlington collection that consisted of original Audubon prints on November 16, 2013. These were not reproductions but some of the original sized and printed editions by John James Audubon. One of these has been an exhibition highlighting the ASC's holdings related to map makers and cartography. The collection houses some of the oldest maps known that document cartography in the New World. Other pieces of art collected are also archived. References Further reading  * Herbert, Anne Hemphill.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is located in the Karur - Pugalur Road. The legend of the temple is associated with Kamadhenu taking up the duties of Hindu god of creation Brahma and creating the hill of butter named Vennaimalai. Overview The temple has an elevated structure, a three-tiered gateway tower, the gopuram, leading to the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 12:00 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April), Thai Poosam during Thai (January - February) and Karthikai during November - December being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, Brahma, the Hindu god of creation was very proud about his profession and Shiva wanted to teach him a lesson. Brahma was overloaded at one point and could not continue his profession. He realised his mistake and prayed to Shiva seeking relief. Shiva directed him to Vanjimalai to perform penance praying to Muruga. Kamadenu, the divine cow, took up the role of Brahma to create beings in earth. It is believed that the cow created a hill made of butter (called vennai in Tamil and the sacred tank with its milk. A sage named Bhagvan was doing penance on the hill. He suddenly got the view of Muruga and informed the ruling king of Karur. The king immediately built a temple for Muruga, placed a Shamugha yantra and installed the images of Kasi Viswanathar and Visalakshi. Architecture The temple is located in Vennaimalai, in the outskirts of Karur in Karur district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Karur to Vennaimalai. The temple has an elevated structure climbed through a flight of steps. There is a three-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower leading to the sanctum. At the bottom of the hill there is a tall granite pillar which is axial to the sanctum. The sanctum houses the image of Balasubramaniyaswamy. In the north west shrine facing the sanctum, the images of Kasi Viswanathar and Visalakshi, the parents of Balasubramaniyaswamy are housed. There is a shrine of Vinayaga facing east in the foothills.

It was discovered in some of the subterranean vaults of the Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram the Indian state of Kerala, when five of its six vaults were opened on 27 June 2011. The vaults were opened on the orders of the Supreme Court of India, which was hearing a private petition seeking transparency in the running of the temple and against a 2007 claim by the Travancore royal family for the wealth in the Temple.https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/kerala-erstwhile-travancore- royal-family-vested-with-rights-to-manage-sree-padmanabhaswamy- temple/article32080957.ece The discovery of the treasure attracted widespread national and international media attention as it is considered to be one of the largest collection of items of gold and precious stones in the recorded history of the world. On the possibility of future inappropriation of the wealth, for the need of a new management and proper inventorisation of the articles in the vaults, a public interest petition was registered with Supreme court of India. In 2020, the royal family won the rights to manage the temple and its financial aspects despite not being the wards of the state. The Supreme court of India overruled Kerala High Courts legal jurisprudence based on the regional facts and recognition of nullified princely agreement based on \\"Ruler of Travancore.\\" It was done by siding to erstwhile pre-colonial customs of the temple management. Vaults The temple management authorities were aware of the existence of six vaults. They are situated very close to the sanctum-sanctorum of the temple on its western side. For documentation purposes, these vaults have been designated as vaults A, B, C, D, E and F. Subsequently, two more further subterranean vaults have been discovered since, and they have been designated as Vault G and Vault H. * Vault B has not been opened presumably for the last 3 centuries. The Supreme Court appointed committee members based on 2014 amicus curiae and audit reports citing several instances of irregularities and mismanagement in the affairs of the temple. They opened the metal-grille door to Vault B and discovered a sturdy wooden door just behind it. They opened this door as well, and encountered a third door made of iron, which was jammed shut. The observers considered forcing their way in, but deemed this improper; they decided to hire a locksmith or a professional to remove the door gently. Then in mid-July, before the locksmith came, the royal family got an injunction from the Supreme Court against opening vault B. Apparently, this was promulgated after a 4 day private decision making process (not publicized for transparency) based on astrology (Ashtamangala Devaprasnam) in 2011. Later in 2017 and 2018 opening of the door was promoted and upheld by related personnel's as a faith affecting issue for making the issue a taboo. * As of May 2016, Vaults G and H are considered forgotten ones that remains closed for approximately two centuries. * Four of the vaults, namely those designated as C, D, E, and F, are in the custody of the temple priests. Over recent years, they have been opened at least eight times every year and some of the contents stored in them are routinely taken out for use on special ceremonial occasions such as temple festivals, and are deposited back after use. * Following the orders of the Supreme Court of India, a court-appointed committee opened the vaults on 30 June 2011 and entered vault A. They unlocked an iron grille and a heavy wooden door, then removed a granite slab from the floor. Beneath, a few steps led to a dark room which stored the treasure. The various items found scattered everywhere seemed to be not arranged systematically. There were baskets, earthen pots, copper pots, all containing valuable objects. Inventory The Supreme Court of India had ordered an amicus curiae appointed by it to prepare an inventory of the treasure. Full details of the inventory have not been revealed. However, newspaper reports gave an indication of some of the possible contents of the vaults. About 40 groups of objects were retrieved from Vault E and Vault F. Another 1469 groups of objects found in Vault C and 617 in Vault D. Over 1.02 lakh (102,000) groups of objects (referred to as articles collectively) were recovered from Vault A alone. According to confirmed news reports some of the items found include: * A high and wide solid pure-golden idol of Mahavishnu studded with diamonds and other fully precious stones. * A solid pure-golden throne, studded with hundreds of diamonds and precious stones, meant for the idol of deity * Ceremonial attire for adorning the deity in the form of 16-part gold anki weighing almost * An long pure-gold chain among thousands of pure-gold chains * A pure-gold sheaf weighing * A golden veil * 1200 'Sarappalli' pure-gold coin-chains encrusted with precious stones weighing between 3.5 kg and 10.5 kg * Several sacks filled with golden artifacts, necklaces, diadems, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, gemstones, and objects made of other precious metals * Gold coconut shells studded with rubies and emeralds * Several 18th-century Napoleonic-era coins * Hundreds of thousands of gold coins of the Roman Empire * An hoard of gold coins dating to the medieval period * According to varying reports, at least three if not many more, solid gold crowns all studded with diamonds and other precious stones and pots of gold. While the above list is on the basis of news reports describing the July 2011 opening (and later) of Vaults A, C, D, E and F, a 1930s report from The Hindu mentions a granary-sized structure (within either Vault C or Vault D or Vault E or Vault F) almost filled with mostly gold and some silver coins. Source of wealth The valuables are believed to have been accumulated in the temple over several thousands of years, having been donated to the Deity, and subsequently stored in the Temple, by various Dynasties, such as the Cheras, the Pandyas, the Kolathiris, the Pallavas, the Cholas, the Travancore Royal Family and many other Kings in the recorded history of both South India and beyond, and from the rulers and traders of Mesopotamia, Jerusalem, Greece, Rome, and later from the various colonial powers from Europe, and other countries. Most scholars believe that this was accumulated over thousands of years, given the mention of the Deity and the Temple in several extant Hindu Texts, the Sangam literature (500 BC to 300 AD wherein it was referred to as the \\"Golden Temple\\" on account of its then unimaginable wealth), and the treasures consist of countless artifacts dating back to the Chera, Pandya, and Greek and Roman epochs. The ancient epic Silappatikaram (circa 100 AD to 300 AD) speaks of the then Chera King Cenkuttuvan receiving gifts of gold and precious stones from a certain 'Golden Temple' (Arituyil-Amardon) which is believed to be the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Gold had been mined as well as panned from rivers in Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Wayanad, Kollam, Palakkad and Malappuram districts for thousands of years. The Malabar region had several centers of trade and commerce since the Sumerian Period ranging from Vizhinjam in the South to Mangalore in the North. Also, at times like the invasion by Mysore, the other royal families like the Kolathiris (a branch of the Thiruvithamkur Royal Family - both originating in the Thiruvananthapuram area) in the then Kerala and the Far-South took refuge in Thiruvananthapuram, and stored their temple-wealth there for safekeeping in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Also, much of the treasures housed in the much larger and as-yet-unopened vaults, as well as in the much smaller cellars that have been opened, date back to long before the institution of the so-called Travancore Kingdom, e.g. the 800-kg hoard of gold coins from 200 B.C that was mentioned by Vinod Rai. Noted archaeologist and historian R. Nagaswamy has also stated that several records exist in Kerala, of offerings made to the Deity, from several parts of Kerala. During the reign of Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, hundreds of temples that were mismanaged in the Kerala region, were brought under the Government. The excess ornaments in these temples were also transferred to the Vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Instead the funds of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple were utilised for the daily upkeep of these temples. From 1766 until 1792, Travancore also provided refuge to around a dozen other Hindu rulers who had fled their own princely states along the Malabar Coast, due to fears of possible military defeat by Tipu Sultan. They came with whatever valuables they had in their temples and donated them to Lord Padmanabha. Many of these rulers, and their extended family members, also left their wealth with Lord Padmanabha when they finally returned home following Tipu Sultan's military defeat by British forces in 1792. There are over 3000 surviving bundles of 'Cadjan' leaves (records) in Archaic Malayalam and Tamil, each bundle consisting of a hundred-thousand leaves, which relate to donations of gold and precious stones made exclusively to the temple over the millennia. Most of these are yet to have been studied and very few have even been glanced at yet. As these pertain exclusively to the donations made over millennia they would throw a lot of light on the story of the treasure. Lastly, it has to be remembered that in the Travancore Kingdom, a distinction was always made between the Government (or State) Treasury (Karuvoolam), the Royal Family Treasury (Chellam), and the Temple Treasury (Thiruvara Bhandaram or Sri Bhandaram).

Shortly after Italy's entry into World War II in June 1940, she was sunk by British torpedo bomber in Augusta, but was later refloated and repaired. She was briefly used in fast troop transport missions to Tunisia until her second and final sinking by Allied aircraft in April 1943.

The turbines were designed to produce and a speed of in service, although the ships reached speeds of during their sea trials while lightly loaded.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 299 They carried enough fuel oil that was intended to give them a range of at a speed of .Ando, p. 16 Their main battery consisted of six guns in three twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the third amidships.Fraccaroli, p. 49 Anti-aircraft (AA) defense for the Navigatori- class ships was provided by a pair of AA guns in single mounts abreast the forward funnel and a pair of twin-gun mounts for machine guns. They were equipped with six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships. The Navigatoris could carry 86‚Äì104 mines. Construction and career Leone Pancaldo was laid down by Cantieri Navali Riuniti at their shipyard in Riva Trigoso on 7 July 1927, launched on 5 February 1929 and completed on 30 November 1929. Between May and September 1930 she underwent modification work aimed at improving stability and seaworthiness. During the 1930s, Pancaldo largely operated with the Italian fleet, participating in exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. Between December 1930 and January 1931 she and seven sisterships were deployed in the Atlantic Ocean in support of Italo Balbo's transatlantic flight from Italy to Brazil.http://www.marinaiditalia.com/public/uploads/2011_05_13.pdf Between 1936 and 1938, Pancaldo also participated in the Spanish Civil War, that saw heavy Italian naval involvement in support of Francisco Franco's forces. Originally classified as an esploratore (flotilla leader/scout cruiser), Pancaldo was re-rated as a destroyer in 1938. After being briefly used for training in Pola, between 1939 and January 1940 she underwent further modification work to her bow in the Muggiano shipyard in La Spezia.  World War II  When Italy entered World War II, on 10 June 1940, Pancaldo was part of the 14th Destroyer Division, together with sisterships Ugolino Vivaldi, Antonio Da Noli and Lanzerotto Malocello. On 9 July 1940 Pancaldo, together with Vivaldi and Da Noli (the latter was however forced to go back before the start of the battle by an engine breakdown), took part in the Battle of Calabria.Gianni Rocca, Fucilate gli ammiragli. La tragedia della Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale, p. 28. After the battle was over, Pancaldo and most of the fleet reached Augusta, Sicily, where they refuelled; they were spotted there by a British reconnaissance plane, and on the following day Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier Eagle attacked Augusta with the aim of striking the Italian fleet during its stop there. Radio intercepts, however, had alerted the Italian commands of the danger, and most of the fleet was transferred to other bases; only Pancaldo and Vivaldi, that had not yet completed refuelling, were left in the harbour when the Swordfish attacked. Both destroyers opened fire with their anti- aircraft guns, but one of the torpedoes dropped by the planes hit Pancaldo, causing her to sink in a few minutes on a 30-meter bottom, with the loss of sixteen men. Inspection of the wreck by divers revealed that the hull was not irreparably damaged, and a decision was made to raise the ship and repair her. To lighten the ship before the salvage, many parts were removed, including her artillery and torpedo tubes; on 26 July 1941, a year after her sinking, Pancaldo was brought to the surface, and on 1 August she entered drydock. After provisional repairs that enabled her to withstand a voyage at sea, on 27 October 1941 Pancaldo left Augusta heading for Genoa, where she underwent extensive reconstruction work in the Ansaldo shipyard, lasting till 17 November 1942. She was also fitted with a Gufo radar, and re-entered service on 12 December 1942, nearly two and a half years after her sinking. Pancaldo was assigned to the 15th Destroyer Division, based in Trapani, but she only became fully operational in March 1943. For a month she was used in fast troop transport missions to Tunisia, in company with other destroyers. On 29 April 1943 Pancaldo sailed from Pozzuoli for one such mission, together with German destroyer ZG3 Hermes; the two ships were carrying 247 and 215 German soldiers, respectively. During the trip, the destroyers were repeatedly attacked by Allied aircraft; after fending off the first two attacks, Pancaldo succumbed at about 12:30 to another attack by 50 USAAF Curtiss P-40s, and sank off Cape Bon.Gianni Rocca, Fucilate gli ammiragli. La tragedia della Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale, p. 276. Of the 527 troops and crew aboard, 199 perished, mostly Italian crew members.

In the winter of 1599-1600, a lull in the campaigning season, troops from the Army of Flanders garrisoned in 's-Hertogenbosch brought in a French prisoner, a cavalry lieutenant in the service of the Republic. When the prisoner wrote to his captain, Pierre de Br√©aut√©, asking that money be sent to ransom him, Br√©aut√© replied that he should be ashamed at having been captured, since any one of his men should be worth two of the enemy. Dutch cavalry lieutenant Gerard Abrahams, hearing of the letter's content, challenged Br√©aut√© to meet him on Vught Heath with equal numbers to put his boast to the test. The two officers obtained permission from their commanders, and the combat took place on 5 February 1600. Abrahams was the first casualty, being shot through the neck by Br√©aut√© in the first charge, and his brother also died in the encounter.

He was a deputy from 1910 to 1927, then a senator from 1927 to 1941. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he served as an aviator, then as under secretary of state for Aviation. He tried to make the aircraft industry more effective in delivering planes of sufficient quality and numbers. As Minister of Labor in 1921‚Äì22 he introduced France's first social insurance bill. He also served in various cabinets as Minister of Education, Minister of Commerce and Minister of Public Works. Early years (1874‚Äì1914) Charles Augustin Daniel Vincent was born on 31 March 1874 in Bettrechies, Nord. Daniel-Vincent studied at the √©cole normale primaire sup√©rieure in Saint-Cloud, the University of Lille and the Sorbonne. In 1901 he became a teacher at the √©cole normale of Douai. In 1904 he transferred to the √©cole normale of Paris. He continued to study, and in 1909 became a Doctor of Letters at Lille. Daniel-Vincent was elected deputy for the 3rd district of Avesnes, Nord, on the second ballot on 8 May 1910. He sat with the Radical Socialists. He was reelected as candidate of the Unified Radical Party on 26 April 1914. World War I (1914‚Äì18) With the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18) Vincent was mobilized and at his request assigned to the airforce. He served as a reconnaissance observer. He became second lieutenant and then lieutenant in a bomber squadron, and was decorated for his performance. He returned to the Chamber and joined the Finance committee, where he was rapporteur of the aviation budget. Due to his knowledge of conditions in the aviation arm Vincent was appointed under-secretary of state for military aviation in the fifth cabinet of Alexandre Ribot, from 20 March 1917 to 12 September 1917. When he was appointed most French planes were inferior to the German fighters, but for contractual reasons inferior planes continued to be delivered. Vincent ordered the Service Technique de l'A√©ronautique (STA√©) to stop designing aircraft and return to supporting existing manufacturers. He tried to speed up production by subcontracting manufacture of airframes and engines, and threatened that if manufacturers did not cooperate he would assign their workers to combat duty. Vincent was Minister of Education and Fine Arts in the cabinet of Paul Painlev√© from 12 September 1917 to 16 November 1917. Later career (1919‚Äì46) Vincent was reelected to the legislature in November 1919 on the Republican Federation list. He also became municipal councilor and mayor of Le Quesnoy in 1919, holding this office until 1940. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Assurance in the seventh cabinet of Aristide Briand, holding office from 16 January 1921 to 15 January 1922. In March 1921 he presented France's first social insurance bill, largely the work of his predecessor Paul Jourdain. The \\"Vincent bill\\", as it was called, proposed insurance that covered risks of illness, maternity, death, disability and old age, and that would be obligatory for all workers in commerce, industry and agriculture, and voluntary for small business owners, artisans and peasant smallholders. The bill was not passed, but provided the basis for future proposals. On 16 October 1921 Vincent was elected to the general council of Nord representing Berlaimont. He was reelected in 1922 and 1928, but was defeated in 1934. He was Minister of Labor and Hygiene in the third cabinet of Raymond Poincar√© from 29 March 1924 to 9 June 1924. Vincent was reelected in the elections of 11 May 1924. On 29 October 1925 he was appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry in the third Painlev√© cabinet. He retained this post until 23 June 1926 in the eight and ninth Briand cabinets. In the tenth Briand cabinet he was Minister of Public Works from 23 June 1929 to 19 July 1926. Vincent was elected senator in a byelection on 29 May 1927, and was reelected on 16 October 1932. In the senate he sat with the Radical Democratic Left and Radical Socialist group. During World War II (1939‚Äì45), on 10 July 1940 Daniel-Vincent voted for the constitutional change that gave full power to the government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain.

Some members of the FKGP, Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MI√âP) and the entire Hungarian Entrepreneurs' Unity Party (MAVEP), the Pensioners' Party (NYUP), the Renewed Independent Smallholders' Party (MFKGP), the Party for a Healthy Hungary (EMP) and many civil organizations also joined the electoral coalition. The cooperation negotiations with the Social Democratic Party (SZDP) remained unsuccessful. In its programme, the MNSZ emphasized the protection of Hungarian soil, the granting dual citizenship to the ethnic Hungarians in the neighboring countries and preventing the privatization of hospitals. The MNSZ was able to gather the required number of signatures to the participation in the EP election. On 13 June 2004, the MNSZ received 20,226 votes (0.66%) and gained no seats. Two days before the election, alliance leader Gyula Balogh turned to the National Election Committee (OVB), because, according to him, the national broadcasters violated the principle of equality of opportunity, but his petition has been rejected.

In 1904 she designed the Springhaven Country Club golf course in Wallingford, an unincorporated community in Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Dixon was the first female golf course architect in the United States, and perhaps in the world. Early life Dixon (left) in 1890 strolling on the south lawn of The Gables Mansion Ida Elizabeth Gilbert was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1854. She was married to the Quaker businessman and Pennsylvania Railroad executive Henry P. Dixon. In addition to his position at the railroad, Henry Dixon was also the owner of the Henry P. Dixon Company, a manufacturer of grates, fireplaces, and furnaces, and was a dealer in tiles for hearths, halls, and mantel facades. The couple resided part-time in a large mansion called \\"The Gables\\" in Wallingford which was designed and custom built by architect Theophilus P. Chandler Jr. in 1889 as a summer home. Designing Springhaven Club In 1904, Dixon designed an 18-hole golf course for the Springhaven Club, where she and her husband were enthusiastic players. They both served on the Club's governing committee. Co-authors Geoffrey S. Cornish and Ronald E. Whitten, in their book The Architects of Golf, credit Dixon as the first female golf architect in America and perhaps in the world. In addition to her architectural work, she served as president of the Women's Golf Association of Philadelphia from 1911‚Äì16. Course redesign In 1910, changes were made to the course by Horace Rawlins and Herbert Barker. Today the course plays 6,518 yards at par 70 from the back tees with a course rating of 71.1 and a slope rating of 130. Death Dixon died at her Wallingford home on November 22, 1916, following a three-month illness. She was survived by her husband and son, Clayton G. Dixon. Her husband, who died on June 21, 1917, is buried alongside Ida at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. A special train departing Broad Street Station in Philadelphia was made available for people wishing to travel to her funeral, which was held in the Dixon home on November 24, 1916. Legacy The Ida E. Dixon Cup golf tournament‚Äîestablished on September 25, 1917‚Äîhas been held every year since 1917 with the exception of 1943 during World War II, and 1975, when the event was cancelled due to rain. The winner of the golf tournament is awarded the Ida E. Dixon Memorial Cup, which is named in her honor. Dixon is best remembered for being the first female golf course architect in the United States.

An easily removable cabin top was available and dual controls could be fitted. The AF-2 had a high, parallel chord, two part wing with straight edges, semi-elliptical tips and about 6¬∞ of sweep. It had a largely wooden structure with twin box spars and was fabric covered. The wing was braced on each side with a pair of parallel, backward leaning, faired struts from the tips of the sponsons to the wing spars. A pusher configuration engine was mounted on the rear wing spar within a central rectangular wing cut-out, with its propeller disk immediately behind the wing trailing edge. The AF-2 fitted was an Walter Vega five-cylinder radial engine, though there were plans to install other types in the power range. Its fuel tank was between the spars, immediately ahead of the gravity fed engine. The empennage was conventional, with a straight edged, blunt topped fin and rudder. The tailplane, semi- elliptical in plan, was mounted halfway up the fin, braced on each side with a pair of struts from the lower fuselage. The elevators had a small cut-out for rudder movement. These tail control surfaces were fabric covered steel structures. For use on land the AF-2 had independently mounted wheels, each between a pair of legs fitted with a shock absorber and hinged on a tube in the leading edge of the sponson. This arrangement enabled them to be raised by rotation, though still exposed, or lowered in fifteen seconds through a worm gear drive. There was a laminated tailskid. The AF-2 probably first flew in late 1930 or early in 1931, though the exact date is not known and there are no further contemporary reports of its development in Flugsport or the major French and English journals.

The song was between the final three finalists, but eventually was defeated by \\"Ghost\\", performed by Jamie-Lee Kriewitz.  Composing and recording  Tobias Sammet, the project's leader and songwriter, described the song as \\"sumptuous\\" and similar to \\"Meat Loaf around 1979 or at most 1990\\". He also said: Indeed, the choirs took a total 14 hours to record. Meat Loaf was initially set to sing on the song, and his management was already in the process of approving it. However, they ultimately decided to decline for unknown reasons. The song was still no more than a single chorus when the idea of having him sing on it was first raised, but a more complete version of it was sent to him. Commenting on the reasons he chose the song as the single, he said it was either it or \\"Draconian Love\\", since both are \\"very catchy\\" and \\"had a solid playtime to release them as a single\\". The label favored the opening track, which Sammet liked as the song was more \\"daring\\" due to its \\"timelessness\\" and \\"old-fashioned\\" tone.

Sammet said it could be a great promotional opportunity and commented: When asked if he was afraid conservative fans would dislike Avantasia's participation due to the pop, commercial nature of Eurovision, Sammet replied: He remarked it will be \\"weird\\" to compete with other people in art, which he sees as \\"subjective\\". The song was between the three songs competing in the final of \\"Unser Lied f√ºr Stockholm\\". In the final round, \\"Mystery of a Blood Red Rose\\" received 21.6% of the public vote, finishing in third place.

Johnson. The short was made independently from the Disney Studios and is notable for being the only animated cartoon made in this manner by one of Disney's core animators, the \\"Nine Old Men.\\" Kimball showed it at film festivals, college campuses during the US presidential elections year in 1968, and personally gave away copies of the film to whoever was interested. In a 2000 interview shortly before his death, Kimball said that he thought that Escalation had not received the mainstream attention it deserved. In 2007, relatives of Kimball put the film online on YouTube. Plot The animation begins with a countdown from 10 and a drumbeat, skipping over the number 7 and with each numeral getting larger in size as the countdown progresses. A dove of peace flies upside down and backwards, with X marks over its eyes as if it were dead. Then a giant statue of the head of Lyndon B. Johnson is slowly wheeled into view, while the melody of the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" plays. One of the statue's ears is shaped as a dollar sign. An actor imitates Johnson's voice reading the lyrics, later joined by a choir, with each instance of the word \\"truth\\" being bleeped out with a cuckoo sound. As the song goes on, Johnson's nose slowly starts to rise in phallic fashion. When fully erect, the nose begins to shake and then violently explodes as images of the Playboy Bunny, bare breasts, hot dogs, copious amounts of meat, Billy Graham, John Wayne, Doris Day, Coca-Cola, beer, Aunt Jemima, Lassie, Superman, Little Orphan Annie, S&H; Green Stamps and cigarettes flash on the screen in rapid succession amidst images and sounds of explosions, followed by a similarly rapid succession of military decoration, ending on the Purple Heart (the medal for those wounded or killed in combat) as a single clock chime is heard. The cartoon fades out by having the statue crack into pieces. The gradual enlargement of Johnson's nose brings up images of Pinocchio, whose nose grew longer whenever he lied.

The cleanup was completed in 1993, and the site was removed from the NPL in 1997, but remains subject to review at 5-year intervals. History The parcel of land in which the landfill was established was purchased by John M. Bowers, a local dental surgeon, in 1957. The following year Bowers began a sand and gravel quarrying operation on the eastern edge of the land adjacent to Island Road. Shortly afterwards, the portion of land between the quarry and the Scioto River was utilized as a landfill, with soil from the quarry used to cover the refuse.

The game was held on April 1, 1985 at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. The Georgetown Hoyas, the tournament's top seed from the East region, faced the Villanova Wildcats, the eighth seed from the Southeast region. The teams came from the same conference, the Big East, and the championship game was the third meeting between them in 1984‚Äì85, after two regular season contests. Villanova won the title game by a score of 66‚Äì64, in what is considered by analysts to be one of the biggest upsets in an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament game. The Wildcats had the highest field goal percentage in Final Four history, over 78 percent (22-of-28) in the game, winning their first national championship in men's basketball. Background Georgetown The Hoyas entered the 1984‚Äì85 season as the defending national champion, having won the title in 1984. Coached by John Thompson, the Hoyas featured center Patrick Ewing, who was named to the 1985 All-American team. The Hoyas held the number one ranking in the Associated Press Poll at the start of the season, and won their first 14 games against Division I clubs. The team alternated the position with fellow Big East team St. John's. Georgetown lost only two games in the regular season, consecutive matchups with St. John's and Syracuse, before an 11-game winning streak prior to the NCAA Tournament that included a Big East Tournament championship. After losing their number one ranking after their pair of losses, Georgetown regained the position in the March 5 rankings and held it at the end of the regular season. The team was thought of at the time as one of the best college clubs in years. Their wins included a pair over Villanova in conference play. In the first game, held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Villanova's home arena, the teams battled into overtime before the Hoyas claimed a two-point victory. The repeat contest, in Washington, D.C., was also closely contested, but Georgetown again prevailed, 57‚Äì50. Georgetown received the top seed in the East regional bracket of the 1985 NCAA Tournament, the first with 64 teams in the field, and faced Lehigh in the first round. A 68‚Äì43 victory set up a second-round matchup with eighth-seeded Temple, which the Hoyas won 63‚Äì46 to advance to the regional semifinals. There, Georgetown was matched with number four seed Loyola University Chicago; the Hoyas prevailed by 12 points and moved on to the East region's final. Against Georgia Tech, the Hoyas played in their closest game of the tournament to that point, winning 60‚Äì54 to advance to the Final Four. In an all-Big East game, Georgetown defeated St. John's 77‚Äì59, behind 20 points by Reggie Williams and 16 by Ewing, to clinch a spot in the national championship game. Villanova Coached by Rollie Massimino, the Wildcats were coming off of a season in which they had lost to Illinois in the second round of the 1984 NCAA Tournament. The team's regular starting lineup included seniors Ed Pinckney, Dwayne McClain, and Gary McLain, along with juniors Harold Pressley and Dwight Wilbur. Villanova began the season 13‚Äì3, before a January 1985 loss at Maryland. The defeat started a slump that lasted throughout the rest of the regular season; the Wildcats had a 5‚Äì5 record in their final 10 regular season games, capped by a 23-point loss at Pittsburgh. After peaking at number 14 in the January 22 rankings, the team fell out of the Associated Press Poll by mid-February. With an 18‚Äì9 record overall entering the 1985 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament, Villanova was not assured of receiving an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. In a rematch against Pittsburgh, the team won by eight points to effectively secure their tournament berth. In the semifinals of the Big East Tournament, the Wildcats suffered a 15-point loss to St. John's, leaving their record at 19‚Äì10 going into the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats received the Southeast regional bracket's eighth seed and were matched in the first round against ninth-seeded Dayton, with the game held in Dayton's home arena. Despite the disadvantage of playing in what amounted to a road game, Villanova advanced after a closely contested contest; a go-ahead layup by Pressley gave the Wildcats a late lead that they held until the end. The Wildcats then won their second-round game, 59‚Äì55, over the region's top seed, Michigan, before a 46‚Äì43 victory in a rematch against Maryland (the fifth seed) that sent them to the regional final. North Carolina, their opponent, held a five-point lead at halftime before a strong performance in the second half led to a 12-point Villanova win and a spot in the Final Four. In their game against Memphis State, the Wildcats won by a 52‚Äì45 final score to gain their title game berth. Game summary The game was played at Rupp Arena, in front of a crowd of 23,124 spectators. Georgetown was listed as a nine-point favorite entering the contest. The Wildcats opened the scoring early in the first half. After Villanova narrowly avoided a turnover twice, Ed Pinckney passed the ball to Harold Pressley; under pressure from Ewing on defense, Pressley scored on a reverse layup to give the Wildcats a 2‚Äì0 lead. The Hoyas' David Wingate evened the score with a successful jump shot. The teams then traded baskets; a slam dunk by McClain was followed by another jump shot by Wingate. Villanova made their first four field goal attempts, but fell behind 10‚Äì8 as they committed four turnovers during the period. Georgetown played a 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 defense focused on trapping and pressuring the Wildcats' players, while Villanova used a match-up zone defense.Fitzpatrick, pp. 240‚Äì242. With about 16 minutes elapsed in the first half, the Hoyas held a one-point advantage. Ewing responded by scoring on dunks on each of Georgetown's following three possessions. The Hoyas were unable to extend their lead, however, because Villanova found success on long field goal attempts. Three Wildcats players scored on long-range jumpers, including a shot by Pressley that fell after hitting the rim multiple times. The Wildcats employed a \\"patient\\" offensive strategy during the game, which was in evidence during the last two minutes of the first half as Pinckney, with two personal fouls, was not on the floor. The team employed what author Frank Fitzpatrick called \\"the last successful stall in college basketball history.\\"Fitzpatrick, pp. 245. After obtaining ball possession with 1:58 left, the Wildcats went into a four corners offense and held the ball until the closing seconds of the half, a tactic that was legal because a shot clock was not instituted in college basketball until the 1985‚Äì86 season. Georgetown was playing a 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 zone defense, allowing the Wildcats to execute their strategy. In one of four times during the game that Villanova maintained possession for over 45 seconds, Pressley made a shot to put his team up 29‚Äì28. A long- distance shot by Wingate missed as time ran out in the first half, and the arm of Georgetown forward Williams made contact with the face and neck of Villanova reserve Chuck Everson; no foul was called, but Villanova assistant coach Marty Marback credited the encounter with giving his team energy going into the halftime break. After an opening period that announcer Brent Musburger called \\"as good a half of college basketball as I've ever seen,\\" the second half began with a successful jump shot by Ewing; Thompson had told the Hoyas to feature him in their offense.Fitzpatrick, pp. 247‚Äì248. The Wildcats reclaimed the lead on a field goal by Harold Jensen, his third of the game, before Pinckney made a shot while being fouled by Ewing. His ensuing free throw attempt was good, and Villanova extended their lead to 34‚Äì30. The play began a stretch of about a minute in which Ewing committed three personal fouls and had to be removed from the Hoyas lineup; with Williams suffering from an ankle injury, Georgetown's two leading players on offense were out of the game. The Wildcats began taking more time on their possessions, and took a 38‚Äì32 advantage in the first four minutes of the half.Fitzpatrick, p. 248. Ewing re-entered the game, but Villanova maintained their lead; three points by McClain brought the score to 41‚Äì36. McLain was injured while running into Hoyas player Horace Broadnax and was temporarily forced to the bench. With 10 minutes left in regulation, the Wildcats held a one-point lead, even though they had attempted only five field goals so far in the second half.Fitzpatrick, pp. 249‚Äì250. Over the next few minutes of play, Villanova went up 53‚Äì48; after a field goal by Pinckney, the Hoyas called a timeout.Fitzpatrick, p. 250. The closing six minutes started with a Georgetown scoring run; the Hoyas took a 54‚Äì53 lead and gained ball possession off of a turnover by Villanova with about four minutes left. At this time, the Hoyas borrowed a page from Villanova's offensive strategy and started running the four corners offense, with the hopes of causing the Wildcats to abandon their regular defense and shift to man-to-man coverage. The team's plan was foiled when a pass by Bill Martin deflected out of bounds off the shin of Broadnax. Under 30 seconds had gone off the clock when the Wildcats regained the ball. Villanova resumed their ball-control offense, and took the lead with 2:37 remaining on a made shot by Jensen; the Wildcats had taken 62 seconds to run the play. Jensen's shot was the last attempted by Villanova in the game; all of the team's remaining points came on free throws. The Wildcats scored the next four points and were up 59‚Äì54 going into the final 84 seconds. Although the team was unsuccessful on multiple one-and-one free throw attempts, they added seven more points in the final portion of the game. The last made free throw, on the second of two attempts by Pressley, gave the Wildcats a 66‚Äì62 advantage with approximately 10 seconds on the clock. A shot by Michael Jackson brought the Hoyas to within two points in the closing seconds. Wingate stopped the clock from expiring by hitting the ball out of play with two seconds left. Jensen inbounded the ball to McClain, who had gone to the floor, and McClain kept possession until time expired and the Wildcats won the game and the Division I national championship, 66‚Äì64. Statistical summary The top scorer in the game was McClain, who had 17 points; just behind him on the Wildcats was Pinckney, who had a 16-point performance. Jensen had a perfect shooting night, going 5-for-5 and finishing with 14 points. The Hoyas' leading scorer was Wingate, who posted 17 points. Ewing had 14 points in the game, but was both out-scored and outrebounded by the Wildcats' Pinckney; he had five rebounds, one fewer than Pinckney. Martin had 10 points in the game and matched Ewing's total of five rebounds. The top assist provider for either team was Georgetown's Jackson, who had nine assists and added eight points. The Wildcats were successful on 22 of 28 field goal attempts in the game, for a shooting percentage of 78.6 percent. The team made all but one of their 10 shot attempts in the second half. The Wildcats set NCAA Tournament championship game records for the highest shooting percentage and the fewest shot attempts; both figures are also records for any Final Four game as of 2019. Villanova made most of their free throw attempts, converting on 22 of 27 attempts. Georgetown made more than 50 percent of their shots as well, with 54 percent shooting (29 for 53). The Hoyas had 19 fewer free throw attempts than Villanova, although they were successful on six of their eight tries. The Wildcats committed 12 fouls in the game, and held Ewing without a free throw attempt. Georgetown had 11 turnovers in the contest, six fewer than the 17 by Villanova; that total included six by Jensen. Sportswriter Tim Layden commented on the Wildcats' statistics, \\"Part of what is so fascinating about the game is that Villanova, when it did not turn the ball over, almost always scored.\\" Each team had 17 rebounds, the fewest in any Final Four contest as of 2019. Aftermath and legacy The Wildcats lost multiple assistant coaches to other college positions in the years following the 1985 NCAA championship game. In the seven seasons Massimino spent as head coach at Villanova before leaving the program after the 1991‚Äì92 season, the team made it to the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament only once. The Wildcats did not return to the Final Four until 2009, and did not reach the championship game again until 2016, when they won to become NCAA champions for the second time. The 1985‚Äì86 Georgetown team had an overall record of 24‚Äì8, and were eliminated in the second round of the 1986 NCAA Tournament by Michigan State. Georgetown's lone Final Four appearance since 1985 came in 2007, when the Hoyas were coached by Thompson's son, John Thompson III. The 1985 NCAA Tournament championship has been described as one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history by numerous writers, including Jack Carey of USA Today and Matt Bonesteel of The Washington Post. As of 2018, the 1984‚Äì85 Villanova team is the lowest-seeded NCAA championship squad.

His friends and fans affectionately called him Chino, a moniker that he proudly used throughout his life. (Spanish). Venezuela Tuya website. Daniel Can√≥nico is best known as the man who anchored the pitching staff for the Venezuela national baseball team which captured the Baseball World Cup in 1941. A short, stocky sort of pitcher with a wicked curveball, Can√≥nico became an instant celebrity in his country, as he was undefeated through five games in the tournament, including the series-tying and deciding games, both against host country Cuba, while placing Venezuela for the very first time among the world baseball elite. But plagued by shoulder and elbow ailments for most of his career, he was solid yet unspectacular over almost two decades in Venezuelan baseball.Guti√©rrez, Daniel; Alvarez, Efraim; Guti√©rrez (h), Daniel (2006). La Enciclopedia del B√©isbol en Venezuela. LVBP, Caracas. After retiring, he became a successful manager and coach in amateur baseball. Early life Can√≥nico was born in Guarenas, Miranda and was raised in Caracas. He was one of two sons of Agostino Can√≥nico, an Italian musician and composer. Mr. Can√≥nico taught his sons music theory at an early age and encouraged them to experiment with diverse instruments. As a young man, Daniel was leading his own little group playing popular tunes and then tried to pursue a professional career as a drummer, but he was not destined to be one of them, as he grew up playing sandlot ball and his passion for baseball led him to neglect his musical education. in contrast, his brother Benito became a notable composer, musician, orchestrator and teacher. Career At age 18, the determined Can√≥nico approached a talent scout of the Liga Nacional de B√©isbol, which had stabilized the first national championship of first division in Venezuela since its inauguration in 1930. Can√≥nico then received an invitation to a tryout in 1934 and was offered a contract to play with the Senadores BBC, where he pitched and played some outfield. By then the league had established itself as an integral part of Venezuelan popular culture through the baseball, as it had a good blend of local and foreign players that included future Venezuelan big leaguers as Alex Carrasquel and Chucho Ramos, as well as several Negro League stars such as Leon Day, Josh Gibson, Monte Irvin, Bertrum Hunter and Leroy Matlock, among other renowned players. This was a great chance for the young Can√≥nico to prove himself. If he could do this, he knew he would be capable of much more if he was given the opportunity. In his rookie year, Can√≥nico posted a 3-3 record with a 1.56 earned run average in 52 innings pitched. He then played briefly for the Gavilanes de Maracaibo in 1935 and returned to the Senadores the next year, playing exclusively as an outfielder/infielder, committing only one error in 55 chances at second base, good enough for a .982 fielding percentage. After that, he focused entirely on pitching. Can√≥nico was aware that his first step should be to set priorities. He then intimidated the batters, even without being a power pitcher. Besides his curve, he developed an unpredictable sinkerball that moved away from hitters, while his average fastball and changeup were secondary pitches. Nevertheless, he was unable to pitch regularly due to arm issues. In 1937 Can√≥nico moved to the Patriotas de Venezuela, playing for them four years before joining the Vargas (1941), Magallanes (1942‚Äì43) Victoria (1943‚Äì44) and Los Sapos (1945) squads. His most productive season came in 1945, when he amassed a mark of 11-1. Overall, he posted a 40-18 record with a 2.62 earned run average (ERA) during his seven seasons in the league. 1941 Baseball World Cup By 1941, Can√≥nico joined the Venezuelan pre-selection baseball team, then was added to the National Team roster for the Fourth Amateur World Series to be played in the month of October. The AWSB featured a nine-team tournament, which was held at La Tropical Stadium in the city of Havana. This was the fourth edition of the tournament, which was won by the Cuban squad in 1939 and 1940. As a result, the local team became a huge favorite before the tournament started. The Venezuelan team prevailed in six of its seven games, with its only defeat coming to the Dominican Republic, and had to face the undefeated Cuban team in the last game of the schedule. Can√≥nico, who had won three of the six victories of his team, was slated to pitch that game and ended up throwing a five-hit, 4‚Äì1 victory against Cuba, a disappointing final for more than 30,000 people gathered at La Tropical. With both clubs tied at 7‚Äì1 after more than two weeks of play, the visitors to settle proudly for the result. Nevertheless, the overconfidents Cubans insisted on an extra playoff game in order to decide an only winner and even allowed a three-day break, which permitted Can√≥nico to rest his arm for one final showdown encounter. Significantly, Can√≥nico had claimed all four of his starts in the preliminary round and posted a very solid 1.69 ERA across 32 innings of work. As a result, the decisive game was played on October 22, 1941, and Can√≥nico won a pitching duel against legendary star Conrado Marrero as Venezuela beat Cuba, 3‚Äì1, which originated great consequences for baseball pride in both countries. Shortly after the victory, the then Venezuelan President Isa√≠as Medina Angarita issued an official decree instituting October 22 as National Sports Day in the country.Los H√©roes del 41 (Spanish).

The series featured a rematch between Marrero and Venezuela's Can√≥nico. This time the Cubans won 8‚Äì0, and the Cuban team regained the Cup. Venezuelan winter baseball Furthermore, Can√≥nico was one of the founding members of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in 1946, playing the dual role of pitcher and manager for the Sabios de Vargas club that won the championship title in the league's inaugural season. Can√≥nico formed a battery with catcher Roy Campanella, who also managed some Vargas games on an interim basis early in the season.Sabios de Vargas history. Pura Pelota. Retrieved on November 27, 2015. But soon thereafter his arm problems re-emerged and Can√≥nico never regained his form. Consequently, when he was able to pitch was ineffective and suffered from bouts of wildness and elbow tendinitis. Can√≥nico later pitched for the Cervecer√≠a Caracas, Patriotas de Venezuela and Leones del Caracas, for whom he worked as a reliever and spot starter before retiring in 1953. Overall, he gathered a record of 4-9 with a 3.76 ERA in 60 pitching appearances, including 20 starts and seven complete games in 218 innings. In between, Can√≥nico pitched for Cervecer√≠a in the Game 8 of the 1949 Caribbean Series and was credited with a loss to the Almendares Cuban team. He later managed the Indios de Oriente in the 1957-58 and 1961-62 VPBL seasons. Late life After retiring, Can√≥nico moved to Barquisimeto, the capital city of Lara state. In his new environment, he worked as an instructor and manager of several amateur baseball teams, including the state's representing team that won three national consecutive titles from 1955 through 1957. His merits began to be recognized widely when he gained induction into the Venezuela Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. Can√≥nico had four children from his marriage with Marta Dort. He died in Barquisimeto in 1975 at the age of 59. Honors and awards For many years Can√≥nico has remained a considerably homegrown icon, even becoming the subject of celebratory songs, while a Caracas sports center was named in his honor in 2013 after his once- in-a-lifetime achievement.Gobierno Nacional inaugur√≥ Polideportivo Daniel 'Chino' Can√≥nico en la parroquia Macarao (Spanish).

However, if one takes a look at the history of the country's music in the 20th century, one can identify a variety of stimuli, ranging from the politically grounded ideology of Mexican national music, to the vision of an authentic Latin American acoustic world and the influences of European musical culture. Jos√© Rol√≥n Alcaraz, who was born on 22 July 1876 in Zapotl√°n in the state of Jalisco and died on 3 February 1945 in Mexico City, is a Mexican composer who has had a strong influence on his country's musical history in the 20th century. He began his studies with Francisco Godinez in Guadalajara and soon became interested in European music. From 1903 till1907, he studied the piano in Paris with the Polish pianist Moritz Moszkowski, and fugues and harmony with the important music pedagogue Andr√© Gedalge, whose pupils included such well-known composers as Ch. Koechlin, Fl. Schmitt, Ravel, Ibert, Honegger and Milhaud. It was probably during this visit to Paris that Rol√≥n discerned the Ô¨Årst discrepancies between the late romantic musical tradition and the rising opposition movements of the early 20th century. Between 1907 and 1927, he lived in Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, founded the municipal symphony orchestra in 1915 and, in 1916, the music academy. During this period, Rol√≥n took every possible opportunity to perform the works of French composers, such as Darius Milhaud and Edgar Var√®se, in Mexico. From 1927 till 1929, he revisited Paris, where his studies of harmony with the influential teacher Nadia Boulanger and composition with Paul Dukas led to a radical change in his musical aesthetics and a new orientation in his compositions. These now took on an increasing slant towards modern music. Back in Mexico, where he worked intensively to improve the Mexican music scene and the musical education (he taught harmony, counterpoint and composition at the 'Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica' in Mexico City and was appointed director in 1938), he began to integrate Mexican elements in his works, which had become dominated by his European way of thinking. His musical vision was to blend formal, harmonic and melodic elements of European music with the idioms of Mexican folklore, so as to enrich both styles. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, Rol√≥n avoided an all too trivial use of folklore, in the sense of character pieces from the Romantic era or as the facade of an ostentatious pseudo 'Mexican' style. However, this was precisely what the Mexican government approved of: after the chaos of the revolutionary years, it demanded identity-establishing works of nationalistic music, based on the cultural tradition of the indigenous people. It was thus unavoidable that Rol√≥n's aesthetic point of view, should be in opposition to the prevailing cultural politics after 1920.

The history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Japan begins after a number of mentions by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who showed a particular interest in introducing Islam to the Japanese people. The first Ahmadi Muslim missionary to be sent to Japan was Sufi Abdul Qadeer, who was sent by the second Caliph. He arrived in Japan on June 4, 1935. Today there is one purpose-built mosque, the largest in the country, representing an estimated 300 Ahmadi Muslims. History Early mentions The history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Japan begins after a number of mentions by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who showed a particular interest in introducing Islam to the Japanese people. He states in 1905, that, He further states that \\"If God commands, I would go to Japan today without learning [the Japanese] language\\". In response to Ahmad‚Äôs desire, a number of his companions, including Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, are known to have written letters to individual Japanese. In 1945, the Second Caliph, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad is stated to have seen a dream that the, On September 8, 1951, Zafarullah Khan, a companion of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was also at that time Pakistan‚Äôs foreign minister and the country‚Äôs delegate to the United Nations Security Council, spoke at the Treaty of San Francisco with Japan. Citing Muhammad‚Äôs example of forgiveness and peace at the Victory of Mecca, Khan spoke in favour of a more humane treatment towards Japan, following the conclusion of the Second World War. At that time, Pakistan was the only country to hold this position. Early efforts Third Caliph to propagate Ahmadiyya teachings The first Ahmadi Muslim missionary to be sent to Japan was Sufi Abdul Qadeer who was sent during the Second Caliphate. He arrived in Japan, on June 4, 1935. Based in Kobe, Qadeer was later joined by another companion, Abdul Ghafoor. However, due to the escalating war, the mission had to be abandoned, and the two missionaries had to return to their country in 1941. Efforts were revived during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Mirza Mubarak Ahmad, a prominent Ahmadi Muslim and later Major Abdul Majeed, a retired soldier and a missionary of the Community was sent by the Third Caliph. During this period, missionary activity was centered in Tokyo. From 1975 to 1983, Ataul Mujeeb Rashed served as a missionary in Japan. Methods adopted by Rashed included flier distribution, such as at the Hachiko exit of the Shibuya Station, and preaching over a loudspeaker, whilst driving a car printed with religious slogans. As advised by the caliph, and recommended by Rashed, the headquarters shifted to Nagoya, when a mission house was bought in the city in 1981. In 1989, a Japanese translation of the Quran was published. The Quran was translated by Atsushi Kobayashi, a 1957 convert, who adopted the name, Muhammad Uwais Kobayashi. Journeys by caliphs The first caliph to visit Japan was Mirza Tahir Ahmad, whose visit in 1989 coincided with the publication of a translation of the Quran into Japanese, published by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The Japan Mosque, the largest in the country, was opened in 2015 by the caliph The current caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad visited the country in 2006, 2013 and also in 2015 to inaugurate the first purpose- built Ahmadiyya mosque in Japan. The opening ceremony, which was held on November 21, 2015, was attended by local residents, religious leaders, monks, and Ahmadi Muslim representatives from over 27 countries. Demographics Today, there are an estimated 300 Ahmadi Muslims in Japan. The majority consist of foreigners from Pakistan, India and Nepal, many of whom arrived after the 1980s. Roughly 20 are Japanese, the majority of which are women married to foreign men. The Community is primarily centered around Nagoya and Tokyo. There is one mission house, first bought in 1981, and located in Meit≈ç- ku, a north-eastern ward of Nagoya, and one purpose-built mosque in Tsushima, a city which lies to the west of Nagoya. The mosque, constructed in 2015, and identified as The Japan Mosque, is the largest in the country. It has a capacity of over 500 people.

Kamal Yousuf, an Ahmadi Muslim missionary, who was appointed for disseminating Ahmadiyya teachings in Scandinavia, first toured Denmark in 1956. The earliest Danes to have converted to the movement were from the 1950s and the Community was first established in 1959, during the last few years of the Second Caliphate. Today, there are two Ahmadi mosques, of which one is purpose-built mosque, the oldest in the country. There are an estimated 600 Ahmadi Muslims in the country. History Recognition Ahmadiyya efforts in Scandinavia began in the 1950s, when an Ahmadi Muslim missionary, Kamal Yousuf, originally from Pakistan, was appointed to open Ahmadiyya missions in the region. Although Yousuf was primarily based in Sweden, he first toured Denmark in 1956. Some of the earliest Danes to have converted to the Islamic faith were also from the 1950s and the 1960s, and who predominantly converted to the Ahmadiyya movement. Among the converts of that period, estimated at almost 30, was Svend Aage Madsen, a teacher who adopted the name Abdus Salam Madsen. Despite Yousuf‚Äôs initial engagement, Islam was introduced in Denmark by converts as opposed to, by foreigners. In other European countries it was foreign missionaries who were chiefly responsible for introducing the religion. In 1961, led by Madsen, the then national vice- president of Community, Ahmadi Muslims applied for recognition as a religious community in Denmark by a royal decree. The Community requested for the civil recognition of Islamic marriage ceremonies and funeral services. However, the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs rejected the application on the basis of the size of the congregation. In 1973, once again led by Madsen, reported that of the 12,000 Muslims in the country, 3,000 to 4,000 of them were associated to the new mosque. However, by this period, royal decree, as form of recognition had been abolished. Nevertheless, a year later, in 1974, the Community was recognized as the first Muslim community of Denmark. Early efforts The Nusrat Djahan Mosque in Hvidore, on the outskirts of Copenhagen is the oldest mosque in Denmark In 1967, Ahmadi Muslims built Denmark‚Äôs first mosque, in Hvidovre, on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Named after Nusrat Jahan Begum, the second wife of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the Nusrat Djahan Mosque was financed solely by female members of the Community. This move was perhaps motivated by the country‚Äôs push for gender equality and female empowerment. In 1966, roughly five days prior to construction, the Hvidovre Municipality revoked its initial permission to construct the mosque. On the other hand, the third caliph of the Community, Mirza Nasir Ahmad was due to arrive in the region, to lay its foundation. The mosque‚Äôs architect, John Zachariassen, reported the situation to the then Prime Minister of Denmark, Jens Otto Krag. Krag gave a notice to ignore the municipal decision and to continue with the construction work. The foundation stone was finally laid on May 6, 1966 and the mosque, the construction of which gained widespread media attention, was inaugurated a year later by the caliph on July 21, 1967. The opening ceremony was attended by representatives of the Danish government. Islam was properly introduced in Denmark by converts to the Ahmadiyya movement, as opposed to, by foreigners. Some converts attempted to publish Danish literature in order to gain more converts. Aktiv Islam, translated as \\"Active Islam\\" was one magazine started by the Community, which primarily featured Danish translations of articles published in English magazines. In 1967, the Community published the first translation of the Quran in Danish. The main translator was Abdus Salam Madsen himself, whose publication was the sole translation available to the Danish public for over four decades. Until the late 1980s, Madsen was seen as the leading public figure of Islam in Denmark. Demographics During the period of the 1950s and the 1960s there were an estimated 30 Danes who converted to the movement. The Community has not been able to attract similar numbers since then. Today, besides a number of converts, the majority of the members consist of immigrant populations from Pakistan. There are roughly 600 Ahmadi Muslims in the country. There are two Ahmadi Muslim mosques, of which one is purpose built. The Nusrat Djahan Mosque, which lies on the outskirts of Copenhagen, in Hvidovre, is the oldest in the country. The Baitul Hamd Mosque is in Nakskov, a small town in southern Denmark.

Racing only as a two-year-old in 1977, she won three times and finished second twice, from five races. After winning on her debut and finishing second on her next appearance, she recorded her first major success when defeating male opponents in the Chesham Stakes. She returned from a late summer break and finished second in the Moyglare Stud Stakes before winning the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes. Sookera never ran again but became a very successful broodmare. She produced several winners including So Factual and is the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Dansili, Leroidesanimaux, Banks Hill and Intercontinental. Background Sookera was a \\"strong, good-quartered\\" brown mare with a white blaze bred in Kentucky by the British businessman Robert Sangster in association with the British Bloodstock Agency. She was sired by Roberto, an American-bred horse who won the Epsom Derby and the inaugural Benson and Hedges Gold Cup as a three-year-old in 1972. At stud, Roberto sired many important winners including Sunshine Forever, Touching Wood, Real Shadai, At Talaq, Lear Fan, Kris S. and Dynaformer. Her dam, Irule, was a granddaughter of Itsabet, an American broodmare whose other descendants have included the dam of Giant's Causeway As a yearling, Sookera was offered for sale at Saratoga but failed to make her reserve price of $20,000. She was sent to race in Europe where she was trained by Dermot Weld. Racing career 1977: two-year-old season Sookera made her racing debut on 17 March, the opening day of the 1977 Irish flat racing season, when she won the Castrol Stakes over five furlongs on soft ground at Phoenix Park Racecourse. At the time she was still two months away from her actual second birthday. On her next appearance over six furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse in May she was beaten a length by the Vincent O'Brien- trained Turkish Treasure, to whom she was conceding seven pounds in weight. The winner went on to take the Cherry Hinton Stakes and the Park Stakes. In June the filly was sent to England and was matched against male opposition in the Chesham Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. She recorded her first major win as took the lead a furlong out and won decisively by one and a half lengths from Tumbledownwind, a colt who went on to win the Gimcrack Stakes. After a break of almost ten weeks, Sookera returned for the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh in late August and was made the even money favourite. She appeared slightly short of full fitness in the pre-race paddock and finished second, beaten one and three quarter lengths by the winner Ridaness. On her final appearance of the season, Sookera was sent back to England for the Cheveley Park Stakes (then the only Group One race in Britain restricted to juvenile fillies) at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Ridden by Wally Swinburn, she started at odds of 3/1 in a field which also included Noiritza (National Stakes), Fair Salinia, Petty Purse (Star Stakes), Shapina (runner-up in the Cherry Hinton Stakes) and Smarten Up. Sookera took the lead a furlong out and looked likely to win easily but had to be pushed out by Swinburn in the closing stages to hold off Petty Purse and Fair Salinia by three quarters of a length and a head. Sookera was expected to be a contender for the British Classic Races in 1978 but never ran competitively again after her win at Newmarket. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1977: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the Irish Free Handicap Sookera was the top-rated filly, equal with Fairy Bridge. In the British Free Handicap she was rated second, five pounds behind Cherry Hinton. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 117, eight pounds behind their top-rated juvenile filly Cherry Hinton. Breeding record Sookera was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Sangster before being sold to Juddmonte Farms. She produced at least 11 foals and 8 winners between 1980 and 1996. The best of her offspring on the track was the sprinter So Factual but her most enduring influence has come through the descendants of her daughter Kerali. * Resooka, a brown filly, foaled in 1980, sired by Godswalk.

She has written and published the following novels: Peque√±os hombres blancos (Adriana Hidalgo, 2006), Nudos (Adriana Hidalgo, 2008), and Trasfondo (Adriana Hidalgo, 2012). Writing Peque√±os hombres blancos is the tale of a provincial teacher, set during the Argentine dictatorship of the 1970s.\\"Peque√±os hombres blancos.\\" La naci√≥n (October 9, 2006). The heroine of Nudos is a social worker whose job opens onto a whole set of stories from figures on the margins of Argentine society. Tandil's El Eco described it as \\"exceed[ing] all expectations.\\"Carolina Cordi, \\"Nudos, la segunda novela de Patricia Ratto redobla la apuesta y desaf√≠a al lector atento.\\" El eco (August 13, 2008). But Ratto is probably best known for Trasfondo, a fictional reconstruction of the submarine the ARA San Luis's contribution to the Falklands War. For many weeks, after the sinking of the General Belgrano and the subsequent return of the Argentine fleet to port, the San Luis was the only Argentine ship at sea in the war zone. Ratto portrays the isolation of the submarine and its crew, who are almost perpetually submerged and see little more than fog on the few occasions they surface. Ultimately it is revealed that the novel's narrator, a sailor who seems to interact little with his crewmates, has died before the submarine even sets sail. As he ponders as one point in the narrative: \\"Can one really die and not know it?\\" Writing in La Naci√≥n, Osvaldo Quiroga commends Ratto's prose style for its \\"rare beauty and admirable precision.\\"Osvaldo Quiroga, \\"Malvinas y sus fantasmas\\". La Naci√≥n (April 7, 2012) The critic Mart√≠n Kohan, meanwhile, compares Trasfondo to Fogwill's celebrated Malvinas Requiem (Los pichiciegos), observing that while \\"Fogwill's pichiciegos [. . .] see ghosts briefly, Ratto's sailors, in their submarine war, are ghosts throughout.\\" List of works * . * . * .

He was born in Clowne, Derbyshire, the only son of Samuel Sykes, the local greengrocer and was educated at the Netherthorpe Grammar School and Sheffield University, where he gained a BSc in physics in 1925. He stayed on there to do a PhD course in physics but after one year accepted an invitation by Metropolitan-Vickers of Manchester to complete an unfinished project on the alloys of zirconium. The results of that study earned him a PhD in metallurgy and a position in the research department of Metropolitan-Vickers. Based on his work on alloys at Metropolitan-Vickers he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943, his application citation referring to his original investigations into the order-disorder transformation in alloys, the use of x-rays for analysis and his developments of X-ray tubes, continuously evacuated valves and diffusion pumps, and his work on production of hard metals. During the Second World War he carried out work on armour piercing shells at the National Physical Laboratory and headed the Armament Research Laboratory at the Projectile Development Establishment at Fort Halstead, Kent. In 1944 he was appointed director of the Brown‚ÄìFirth research department in Sheffield, contributing his large knowledge of special materials and alloys to the development of high temperature gas turbines. In 1951 he was made managing director of Thomas Firth and John Brown Ltd, becoming deputy chairman in 1962 and chairman in 1964. He retired in 1967.

The school is part of the Near North District School Board and is responsible for the education of students in grades 9-12 in the east side of the Parry Sound District (also known as the \\"Almaguin Highlands\\"), the school serves 19 small communities and townships. Students and Athletes at AHSS are known as Highlanders, the schools colours are dark green, black, & gold. Almaguin Highlands Secondary School was founded in 1959, the new and currently used school building was founded in September 2011.  History   The Old School  The Old AHSS, July 2012 AHSS (known then as Sundridge- South River Secondary School) was originally built to replace Sundridge High School, Sundridge and South River High School, South River. In the early 1960s the building underwent a giant expansion (bigger addition then the size of the original school) to become Almaguin Highlands Secondary School, this new school also eliminated the need of Burk's Falls High School, Burk's Falls and Powassan High School, Powassan. This new school had a reach from Nipissing in the north to Magnetawan in the West and Novar in the south, including all area between. The New School  In the mid 2000s (Around the school's 50th Anniversary) planning for a replacement high school for the area arose. This was cause to the old school having problems with asbestos as well as the building becoming dated with many repairs and upgrades needed. With the help of a government grant the new building began construction in early 2010. The new school was finished construction in September 2011, causing students to be delayed by one week starting the new school year. The new school is significantly smaller in size then the old school was (New buildings capacity around 850 where the old school could hold 2000+) When it opened the school was missing bleachers in the gym, slide out auditorium seats in the cafetorium (a combination room of the cafeteria and an auditorium), a soccer field, a running track, track & field jumping pits, and only a plywood deck on the stage. During the 2011-2012 school year fundraising allowed the building of the bleachers and auditorium seats. Due to having no field students during gym classes, home soccer games, and track & field still took place at the old school, leaving the students to be bused over to the old site. During the 2014-2015 school year the soccer field was constructed, ready for use in fall 2015. Over the 2015 summer break the stage deck was also replaced to proper decking. As of right now the school is still lacking a functioning running track and jumping pits, but students are no longer bused to the old school.

It later became a battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment in the Territorial Army, serving as infantry on the Western Front in World War I and as an air defence unit during and after World War II. Origin An invasion scare in 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs).Beckett. The services of a corps at Huddersfield were accepted by the Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 3 November 1859, when it was assigned the number 10, but by July 1860 it had become the 6th Yorkshire West Riding Rifle Volunteer Corps, with four companies. The title 'The Huddersfield' was added in 1868. It became the senior unit of the 5th Administrative Battalion of West Yorkshire RVCs when that was formed at Huddersfield on 18 September 1862 with the following organisation (dates are for first officers' commissions):Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 95.Westlake, pp. 260‚Äì7. * 6th (The Huddersfield) Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Huddersfield 24 February 1860 * 32nd Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Holmfirth 2 June 1860 * 34th (Saddleworth) Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Saddleworth 10 September 1860, joined 5th Admin Bn in 1877 * 41st Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Mirfield 15 March 1869 * 44th Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Meltham 29 August 1868, disbanded 1875. The annual inspection of the battalion was a major social event: two or three thousand people attended the 1869 parade, when the Huddersfield Rifles, Holmfirth Volunteers, and Mirfield and Meltham Companies were inspected, and the Saddleworth Volunteers 'kept the ground' with the police.Leeds Mercury, 12 July 1869. Later, the Huddersfield Rifles had a prizewinning brass band.Huddersfield Rifles at Brass Band Results On 1 June 1880 the 5th Admin Bn was consolidated as a new 6th Yorkshire West Riding RVC with the following organisation:Leeds Mercury, 20 June 1880. * A, B, C & D Companies at Huddersfield (ex-6th RVC) * E Company at Holmfirth (ex-32nd RVC) * F, G, H & J Companies at Saddleworth (ex-34th RVC) * K Company at Mirfield (ex-41st RVC) * An additional company was formed in Huddersfield in 1900. Duke of Wellington's Regiment Cap badge of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment On 1 July 1881, as part of the Childers Reforms, the corps became a Volunteer Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment and on 1 February 1883 was designated as the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the regiment. At this time, battalion headquarters was at The Armoury in Ramsden Street, Huddersfield. The uniform had been scarlet with sky blue facing, but the facings were changed to the standard white by 1887. Under the mobilisation scheme introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 the units of the Volunteer Force were assigned to either garrisons or mobile brigades. The Volunteer Battalions of the Duke of Wellington's were assigned to the West Yorkshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade in Northern Command and in the event of war were expected to mobilise at Leeds.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6. Boer War Volunteers from the battalion served in the 2nd Boer War, gaining the unit its first Battle Honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. Territorial Force When the Territorial Force (TF) was formed under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, Volunteer Battalions were renumbered as battalions of their parent regiments. The 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's formed two new battalions: the 5th Battalion at Huddersfield, and the 7th Battalion at Milnsbridge.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. The former West Yorkshire Brigade was split in two, and all four TF battalions of the battalions of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment composed the new 2nd West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 85‚Äì91.James, p. 76. World War I Mobilisation At the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left for their annual training camps, but on 3‚Äì4 August the 2nd West Riding Brigade was ordered to its war stations, guarding coastal defences near Hull and Grimsby.Duke of Wellington's at Long, Long Trail On 5 November they were relieved and moved to billets in Doncaster, where the division formed part of Central Force of Home Defence, and began to train for active service. Meanwhile, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units for each existing TF unit had been authorised on 31 August 1914. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, together with the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. These battalions were distinguished by the prefix '2/' being added to their title, while the parent battalions took '1/'; later, 3rd Line battalions were organised as well.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. 1/5th Battalion On 31 March the West Riding Division was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force, and the infantry embarked at Folkestone, the 1/5th Bn landing at Boulogne on 14 April 1915. On 15 May, the division officially became the 49th (West Riding) Division, and the 2nd Brigade became 147th (2nd West Riding) Brigade. The battalion now underwent more than a year of trench warfare with few notable events except a peripheral part in the Battle of Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915) and sustaining the First German phosgene attack on British troops (19 December 1915).Edmonds, pp. 158‚Äì62. Somme For the attack on the first day of the Battle of the Somme (the Battle of Albert, 1 July 1916), 49th was the reserve division for X Corps, which was tasked with capturing the Thiepval plateau. 147th Brigade was moved up in the late morning, crossing the swampy River Ancre, and then occupying dug-outs previously occupied by the attacking divisions. The brigade thus escaped the casualties suffered by the rest of the 49th Division as it renewed the fruitless attacks on Thiepval.Edmonds, p. 412. However, the 49th Division was thrown into action repeatedly during the long Battle of the Somme: * Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14‚Äì17 July) * Battle of Pozi√®res Ridge (23 July‚Äì18 August and again 27 August‚Äì3 September) * Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette (15‚Äì22 September) Ypres During the Third Ypres Offensive the 49th Division was engaged in peripheral activities along the Flanders Coast from 12 July to 23 September 1917, which came to nothing as the main Ypres attacks failed to break through the German lines. 49th Division made one attack at Ypres, at the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October. The division started from its assembly area during the previous night. Ground conditions were atrocious, the approach routes were under enemy shellfire, and the men only just reached their jumping-off line before Zero hour. Much of the supporting artillery was unable to get into position. Consequently, the attack bogged down virtually on the start line. Casualties were heavy, and many of them could not be evacuated until the exhausted 49th Division was relieved by the New Zealand Division.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì37.Pugsley, pp. 281‚Äì3. Disbandment By the beginning of 1918 the British manpower crisis was so bad that one battalion in each brigade was broken up to provide reinforcements. At the end of January 1918 the 1/5th Duke of Wellingtons was disbanded. Some men were drafted to other battalions of 147 Bde, the remainder were transferred to the 62nd Division where they amalgamated with 2/5th Bn, which became simply the 5th Bn. 2/5th Battalion The 2/5th Duke of Wellington's was raised at Huddersfield on 9 October 1914, forming part of 2/2nd West Riding Bde in 2nd West Riding Division, later numbered 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade and 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division respectively. The division began to assemble for training in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire in March 1915. The 2nd Line battalions were already supplying reinforcements to the 1st Line; once they left their regimental stations in March, new 3rd Line or Reserve battalions were formed to take over this role.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 41‚Äì8. Arms and equipment were slow to reach the units. A few drill and service rifles were received in April 1915, but these were soon withdrawn and replaced by .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train. These were not replaced with Lee-Enfield service rifles until January 1916. Meanwhile, the troops trained in the Dukeries area of Nottinghamshire and in south and east Yorkshire until November 1915, when it moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where it dug an entrenched defence line. Finally, it moved to Salisbury Plain for battle training at the beginning of 1916. However, recruitment in the West Riding was unable to keep up with the demands of the units already raised there, and orders were issued on 14 March 1916 that for each draft reaching the units of the 62nd Division an equal number had to be returned to the 3rd Line for drafting to the 1st Line battalions in France. This arrangement considerably delayed the despatch of 62nd Division on active service. It was only after spending the summer of 1916 training in East Anglia (with 2/5th Bn stationed at Halesworth, Suffolk in June) and then moving into winter quarters in the East Midlands (with 2/5th Bn at Bedford) that orders were issued on 23 December for the division to be ready to embark for France on 5 January 1917. 1917 By 18 January the division had crossed from Southampton to Le Havre and concentrated around Authie. It served in the operations on the River Ancre in February and March, and later in March it followed up the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. On 11 April it was engaged in the First Battle of Bullecourt, and on 15 April 186th Bde was involved in repelling the German attack at Lagnicourt. 62nd Division attacked again at the Second Battle of Bullecourt in early May, and was engaged in further actions along the Hindbenburg Line later in the month. The division was not involved in the great Ypres offensive of 1917, and was therefore fresh when it was selected to take part in the tank attack at Cambrai on 20 November. The division attacked towards Havrincourt, where the Germans put up most resistance. 186th Brigade was in divisional reserve, and after the village had been cleared, it moved on towards the second objective, the village of Graincourt. Men of the Duke's were reported to have advanced firing Lewis guns from the hip during street fighting in Anneaux.Cooper, pp. 97‚Äì9, 109‚Äì10.Griffiths, p. 134. On the second day of the battle, 186th Bde attacked towards Bourlon with 2/5th Duke of Wellington's as the reserve battalion. The last attack on Bourlon village was made on 27 November, when 2/5th Bn was checked by heavy machine-gun fire and was unable to link up with the flanking division. The division was then relieved.Cooper, pp. 129‚Äì31, 170. 1918 At the end of January 1918 the battalion absorbed part of the 1/5th Bn (see above) and was redesignated simply 5th Bn; at the same time the 2/6th Duke of Wellingtons in 186 Bde was also broken up, and some of the men were drafted into the 5th Bn. During the German Spring Offensive, 62nd Division came up from support and was involved in the Battles of Bapaume (25 March) and Arras (28 March). After some four days' hard fighting the German advance was halted in the division's sector.Blaxland, pp. 75, 84‚Äì5. In June 1918, the 2/7th Duke of Wellingtons in 186 Bde was broken up, and some of the men were drafted into the 5th Bn. Similarly, the battalion received some men from the 12th Bn Green Howards when that was broken up in July 1918.Becke. Pt 3b, pp. 102‚Äì4.Johnson, p. 87. From 20 to 30 July the 62nd Division counter-attacked under French command in the Battle of Tardenois.Blaxland, p. 153. It then reverted to British command for the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, beginning with the Second Battle of Bapaume, when the division effectively exploited a pre-dawn attack by 2nd Division on 25 August, and then attacked again in the afternoon of 29 August, when the 5th Bn was recorded as having followed the Creeping barrage and achieving a great success 'with the bayonet'.Blaxland, p. 208.Griffiths, Table 9, p. 146. It continued with the Battle of the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line (2 September) and then advanced to the Hindenburg Line to participate in the battles of Havrincourt (12 September) and Canal du Nord (27‚Äì30 September).Blaxland, p. 223. At the Canal du Nord, 186th Bde was tasked with passing through the first wave of attackers to seize the canal crossings at Marcoing to form a bridgehead on 28 September. The canal here was 50 foot (15 m) wide, and the water had run out of the damaged locks, resulting in thick mud. However, 5th Duke's crossed the damaged bridge in single file and by 11.00 was aligned along the railway embankment beyond. From here any further advance was stopped by heavy fire. A fresh barrage at 18.00 allowed the battalion to renew its advance to the final objective, the support trench of the German Marcoing Line. At this point the centre and left companies were heavily counter-attacked, and were fired at from the rear where insufficiently guarded prisoners had picked up weapons and returned to the fight. The two centre companies succeeded in retiring to the railway embankment but the left company was almost surrounded and had to fight its way out. The right company, however, maintained its position in the Marcoing Line. The following day 2/4th Duke's passed through the battalion's position and continued the advance.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 49‚Äì50, 199. Private Henry Tandey, VC, DCM, MM. Private Henry Tandey, a pre-war Regular soldier, had joined the battalion from 12th Bn Green Howards on 26 July. In a single month he won a Distinguished Conduct Medal at Vaulx Vraucourt on 28 August, a Military Medal at Havrincourt on 12 September and finally a Victoria Cross at Marcoing on 28 September (when he was wounded), making him the most highly decorated private soldier of the British Army in the war.Johnson. On 20 October, during the Battle of the Selle, a company of 5th Duke's waded across the River Selle unopposed at St Python even before Zero hour and the rest of the battalion crossed by bridges erected by the sappers in the dark. After some hard fighting they pushed on to their objective, forming a defensive flank to cover the capture of Solesmes by the rest of the brigade.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 340. At the opening of the Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, 186th Bde led off, but the start was hampered by German counter-bombardment and mist. Resistance was slight at first, but stiffened as the advance continued. However, they pushed on again in the afternoon, the brigade taking hundreds of prisoners.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 486. Afterwards, the division remained in the front line and fought its way toward Maubeuge, passing through the southern outskirts and crossing the River Sambre on 9 November. When the Armistice came into force on 11 November there was no sign of the rapidly retreating enemy in front of the division's outposts. The division was selected to move into Germany and occupy bridgeheads on the Rhine, taking up its positions on 25 December. It was the only TF division to cross the frontier into Germany. From 21 February 1919 the infantry battalions were progressively relieved by other units and returned to England for demobilisation. The battalion was formally disembodied on 26 May 1919. 3/5th Battalion This battalion was formed at Huddersfield on 25 March 1915 to provide drafts to the 1st and 2nd Line. In April 1916 it was designated the 5th Reserve Bn, and went with the other reserve battalions of the regiment to Clipstone Camp, Nottinghamshire. On 1 September 1916 it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn. Interwar When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 (renamed the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921) the 5th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment was reformed at Huddersfield, once again in 147th (2nd West Riding) Brigade of 49th (West Riding) Division.5th DWR at Regiments.org.Titles and Designations, 1927. In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into searchlight battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The 5th Duke of Wellington's was one unit selected for this role, becoming 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE on 10 December 1936, retaining its Duke of Wellington's cap badge. Consisting of HQ and four AA companies (370‚Äì373) at the Drill Hall, Huddersfield, the unit was subordinated to 31st (North Midland) AA Group (later Brigade) in 2nd AA Division.Frederick, pp. 859, 867.Litchfield, p. 268.Monthly Army List.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 113. With the continued expansion of Britain's AA Defences, new formations were created under AA Command, and in June 1939 the 31st AA Bde transferred to a new 7th AA Division in time for mobilisation just before the outbreak of World War IIAA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LX, p. 378. World War II  Mobilisation  The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. On 1 August 1940, all the AA battalions of the Royal Engineers were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA), where they were termed searchlight regiments, the Huddersfield unit becoming the 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's) Searchlight Regiment, RA.43 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Blitz In November 1940, during the Blitz, the brigade transferred again to 10th AA Division, responsible for the air defence of Yorkshire and the Humber Estuary, with 31st AA Bde concentrating on defending the industrial cities of West Yorkshire. It remained with this formation for the next two years.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.10 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45. Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 260. Mid-war The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 238th S/L Training Rgt at Buxton where it provided the basis for a new 544 S/L Bty formed on 16 January 1941. This battery later joined a newly-forming 91st S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 862. From 12 May 1941, 370 S/L Bty came under command of 30th (Surrey) S/L Rgt in 39 AA Bde,39 AA Bde War Diary 1939‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/2272. then in the summer of 1941, the battery came under 84th S/L Rgt in 39 AA Bde.39 AA Bde War Diary June‚ÄìDecember 1941, TNA file WO 166/2273.

Early in 1943 the regiment transferred to 32 (Midland) AA Bde (both brigades being in what was now 5 AA Group).Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83. By August 1943 the regiment was in 50 AA Bde.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84. By early 1944 AA Command was being forced to release manpower for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), and all Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced by one battery. On 1 June E Troop of 372 Bty left and joined 58th (Middlesex) S/L Rgt as E/425 Trp.Routledge, p. 409. Operation Overlord In the planning for Operation Overlord, No. 85 Group RAF was to be responsible for Night-fighter cover of the beachhead and bases in Normandy after D-Day, and was keen to have searchlight assistance in the same way as Fighter Command had in the UK. 50 AA Brigade (now often referred to as 50 S/L Bde) joined 21st Army Group's GHQ AA Troops for this purpose, although it retained responsibilities under AA Command. A detailed plan was drawn up for a belt of S/L positions deployed from Caen to the Cherbourg peninsula. This required nine S/L batteries of 24 lights, spaced at 6000 yard intervals, six rows deep. Each battery area was to have an orbit beacon, around which up to four fighters would be positioned at varying heights. These would be allocated by fighter controllers, and the S/Ls would assist by illuminating targets and indicating raid approaches, while area boundaries would be marked by vertical S/Ls. 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's) S/L Rgt was one of the regiments specially trained for this work.Routledge, p. 304, Table XLIX, p. 319.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. For example, 370 S/L Bty spent September 1944 undergoing battle training in Devonshire.370 S/L Bty War Diary, September 1944, TNA file WO 171/1212. In practice, most of this plan was never implemented, liaison with the US Army units around Cherbourg having proved problematical once they were on the ground. 50 S/L Brigade therefore remained in AA Command, waiting to cross to Normandy until long after D-Day.Routledge, p. 316. 600 Regiment, RA By the autumn of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted. At the same time 21st Army Group was experiencing a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry. The War Office began to reorganise surplus AA regiments in the UK into infantry units, primarily for duties in the rear areas, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2.Routledge, p. 421. On 1 October 1944, 43rd S/L Rgt was converted into 43rd (5th Bn Duke of Wellingtons) Garrison Regiment, RA.Garrison Regiments RA at RA 39‚Äì45. Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. A month later, it was reorganised as an infantry battalion and redesignated 600th Regiment RA (5th Bn Duke of Wellingtons). It was the first such RA infantry regiment formed, and was sent to join Second Army in NW Europe for line of communication duties.600 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Joslen, p. 463. The unit was placed in 'suspended animation' in February 1945 and its personnel drafted to other units. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment was initially reformed at Huddersfield as 578th (5th Bn Duke of Wellington's) Searchlight Regiment, RA. However, shortly afterwards it was re-roled as a mobile AA artillery unit under the designation 578th (5th Bn, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RAFrederick, p. 1023.564‚Äì591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. It formed part of 69 AA Bde based in Leeds.Litchfield, Appendix 5.AA Bdes 67‚Äì106 at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. On 10 March 1955, AA Command was disbanded and there was a major reduction in the number of TA air defence units. 578 HAA Rgt was amalgamated with 382 Medium Regiment, RA and 673 Light AA Regiment, RA, which had formerly been the 4th and 6th Battalions respectively of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. The amalgamated regiment continued as 382 Medium Regiment, with the 578th providing one battery (sources differ as to whether this was designated 'P' or 'Q' Bty).Litchfield, pp. 267‚Äì9.Frederick, p. 1009.372‚Äì413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.638‚Äì677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. In 1957, some personnel of the 5th Duke of Wellington's battery transferred to the 7th Bn Duke of Wellington's (originally the other half of the 2nd Volunteer Bn split up in 1908, see above), which was redesignated 5th/7th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment. Finally, in 1961, the rest of 382 Medium Regiment RA converted to infantry and merged with the 5th/7th Bn, bringing together all four Territorial battalions of the regiment. It was designated the West Riding Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's and in 1967 merged into the all- Territorial Yorkshire Volunteers.7th DWR at Regiments.org. Honorary Colonels * Sir Hildred Carlile, 1st Baronet, CBE, TD, was appointed Honorary Colonel on 23 June 1906, and retained the position until World War II. Battle Honours The regiment was awarded the Battle Honour South Africa 1900‚Äì02 for the participation of its volunteer detachment in the 2nd Boer War. The TF battalions contributed to the honours awarded to the parent regiment after World War I. The Royal Artillery does not carry battle honours, so none were awarded for the battalion's service during World War II. Insignia The battalion retained its Duke of Wellington's Regiment cap badge when converted to the searchlight role. 578th HAA Regiment wore it on a red backing, together with a red lanyard for sergeants and above.

It is part of the second fortified belt of forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  During The Annexation, Metz, will oscillate between a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of periodRen√© Bour, Histoire de Metz, 1950, p. 227. and will exceed 25,000 men just before the First World War,L‚ÄôExpress, no 2937, du 18 au 24 octobre 2007, dossier ¬´ Metz en 1900 ¬ª, Philippe Martin. gradually becoming the first stronghold of German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth : Metz annex√©e √† l‚ÄôEmpire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Privat, Toulouse, 1986, (p.350). The ' completes the Second fortified belt of Metz composed of Festen Wagner (1904-1912), Crown Prince (1899 - 1905), Leipzig (1907‚Äì1912), empress (1899-1905), Lorraine (1899-1905), Freiherr von der Goltz (1907‚Äì1916), Haeseler (1899-1905), Prince Regent Luitpold (1907-1914) and Infantry-Werk Belle-Croix (1908-1914). The Group Fortification Yser, or Feste Prince Regent Luitpold, was part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\", encompassing fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the valley Moselle. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack to take back Alsace-Lorraine and Moselle from the German Empire. The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of XIXth century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the fortified group was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces.  Overall design  The protection of the perimeter of Group Fortification Yser is provided by a set of infantry positions, fortified barracks and artillery batteries scattered over a wide area and concealed by the natural topography. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville to be like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®res developed by the French. It later inspired the engineers of the Maginot Line.  Construction and facilities  Covering an area of 83 ha, the Feste Prince Regent Luitpold is constructed from 1907 to 1914. The group fortification has 2 fortified barracks and can accommodate a total of 560 men. It has 8 pieces of artillery, 6 of them 100mm and 2 of them 77mm. It has eight domes and twenty observation points and lookouts. The various items are connected by 1,700m of underground galleries. In its water tanks, it has 2,640 m3 of water. The energy required for its operation is ensured by seven diesel engines of 27 hp each.  Successive assignments  During The Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, the fort receives a garrison of gunners belonging to the XVIth Army Corps. From 1914-1918, it served as a relay for the German soldiers at the front post. Its equipment and weapons are then at the forefront of military technology. In 1919, the fort was occupied by the French army. After the departure of French troops in June 1940, the German army reinvests the fort. In early September 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz, the German command integrates the fort into the defensive system set up around Metz.  Second World War  On September 2, 1944, Metz is declared fortress Reich by Hitler. The fortress must be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 132. The next day, September 3, 1944, General Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz, established his High Command with the main command post in the barracks of fort Alvensleben. Fort Plappeville is indeed located on the side of the US attack in the west, just 4 km from downtown Metz. The same day, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing west of Metz by Chambley, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal, on 6 September 1944, the German lines now rely solidly on the western sector of the forts of Metz, especially on forts Lorraine, Jeanne D'Arc and Driant. The US offensive launched September 7, 1944, is cut short. Troops must stop on the Moselle, despite gaining two bridgeheads south of Metz. The forts are better defended against US attack than expected, so US troops are now out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending further plans of the General Staff of the 90 Infantry Division.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 176-183. While the troops of the Third US Army sit listening to Marlene Dietrich,Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 190. German troops are taking advantage of the lull in fighting to reorganize. Reserve troops of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division fill in with, into the forts of the sector, the elite troops of SS Colonel Siegroth.For his commitment during the Battle of Metz, Siegroth obtained the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes, October 18, 1944. When hostilities resume in November 1944 after a rainy month, the soldiers of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division still hold firmly the forts of Metz, though supplies are more difficult under the artillery and the frequent bombings.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 256. On November 9, 1944, the Air Force sends no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, to drop 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20 000 feet, miss their military objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs, destined to strike the fort Joan of Arc and six other forts designated as priority targets, merely cause collateral damage. At Thionville and to Saarbr√ºcken, the result is inconclusive, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424. By mid-November 1944, the XIIth and XXth US Army corps are trying to take the fortifications of Metz in a pincer movement. 95th Infantry Division must focus its efforts on the western front of Metz, while 5th division must outflank the German lines north and south. The encircling attack on the US military finally succeeds, after three days of uncertainty. On the evening of November 17, 1944, the situation of the German defenders has become critical. The able- bodied men of 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division are mostly surrounded in the forts of Metz. The remaining troops, fragmented in the extreme, hold key positions on the outskirts of the city.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 446. On 22 November 1944, the city falls to the Americans, but certain forts still resist for two long weeks. On December 6, 1944, the fort Saint-Quentin surrenders with its large garrison. The Fort Plappeville disarms the next day. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc, probably because it was controlled by the staff of the 462th Volks-Grenadier- Division and defended by a battalion of fusiliers, is the last of the forts of Metz to disarm, on December 13, 1944. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, is largely achieved.

Between 1936 and 1943 he won six national outdoor championship titles in the triple jump and three in the long jump. He was the long jump world leader in 1941 and held the American record in the triple jump from 1941 to 1956. He competed in the triple jump at the 1936 Summer Olympics, placing 17th. Early life Brown was born in Baker, Louisiana on August 3, 1918. He studied at Baker High School and led the school's track and field team; additionally, he was a good scholastic basketball player. He set long-standing Louisiana state high school records in both the long jump (then known as the broad jump) and the triple jump (then hop, step and jump); his triple jump mark was a national high school record. Brown won his first national (AAU) senior championship title in the triple jump as a high school junior in 1936; he jumped 49 ft 2 in (14.98 m), defeating both defending champion Rolland Romero and 1934 champion Dudley Wilkins. He also won the AAU junior championship that year. At the 1936 United States Olympic Trials, held separately a week after the AAU meet, Brown placed third behind Romero and Wilkins with a jump of 49 ft 1 in (14.96 m); the top three qualified for the Olympic Games in Berlin. The 17-year-old Brown was the youngest athlete on the men's Olympic track squad. In Berlin he was not at his best and placed 17th, reaching 14.36 m (47 ft in) on his best attempt. Collegiate career Brown repeated as AAU triple jump champion in 1937, jumping 49 ft in (15.11 m). After graduating from high school he went to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he was coached by Bernie Moore; Moore's coaching emphasized the sprints and the long jump rather than the triple jump, which before 1959 was not contested at the NCAA championship meet in non-Olympic years. Brown lost the AAU triple jump title in 1938, when he placed third. During his collegiate career Brown set LSU school records in the long jump, the triple jump, the 100-yard dash and the 220-yard dash. In April 1939 Brown set his personal long jump best (25 ft in / 7.74 m) in a triangular meet against Rice University and Texas, but was then sidelined by injuries. He recovered to place second with 24 ft in (7.53 m) at the 1939 NCAA championships. At the 1940 NCAA meet Brown was again second in the long jump (behind Jackie Robinson), also second in the 220 yards, and third in the 100 yards; he was the top scorer of the meet. Brown regained the AAU triple jump title in 1940, jumping 50 ft in (15.30 m) for a then personal best; he also won his first AAU long jump title that year. Brown won his only NCAA title in 1941, winning the long jump with a jump of 24 ft in (7.50 m); in addition, he was second in the 100 yards and third in the 220 yards, and was the leading scorer of the meet for the second consecutive year. At the 1941 AAU championships he repeated as triple jump champion with 50 ft in (15.53 m); the jump was his lifetime best, and broke Dan Ahearn's old American record from 1911 by half an inch. He also repeated as AAU long jump champion, just missing his personal best with a leap of 25 ft in (7.73 m). Brown finished 1941 as world leader in the long jump (with his AAU jump) and joint world leader in the 100-yard dash at 9.5; his triple jump mark ranked him third in the world. Later life Brown graduated from LSU in 1941 and joined the United States Navy, but continued his track career. He won his last national titles as a Navy athlete; he successfully defended both the long jump and triple jump AAU titles in 1942, and won his final national title in the triple jump in 1943. After receiving his discharge from the Navy Brown had a long business career with Kaiser Aluminum, eventually becoming the company's vice president; he retired in 1983.

It belongs to the Diocese of V√§xj√∂. History and architecture Interior view towards the apse Egby Church is the smallest church on √ñland. The present stone church was probably preceded by a wooden church. The oldest parts of the present building are the apse, parts of the choir and the southern wall of the nave, dating from the 12th century. The church was rebuilt during the late 12th and early 13th century into a fortified church. At the middle of the 13th century, the church porch was probably also added. The sacristy is furthermore medieval. The church was quite heavily rebuilt during a renovation which began in 1817 and which wasn't finished until the 1830s. During this time the church tower was added (1818) and the interior redecorated. The church was renovated in 1959. Easily visible from sea, the church is a known landmark for mariners. The church contains a medieval altar and a baptismal font dating from the 12th century in the style of Hegvald. The altarpiece and pulpit are from the mid-18th century and made by master carpenter Nils Lindman.

Its habitat is small ditches and streams, and its larvae are aquatic. Taxonomy This species was described by Victor Motschulsky in 1854. The type locality is Japan, but it was incorrectly given as Java. Its Japanese name, \\"genji-botaru\\", may derive from The Tale of Genji, an 11th- century Japanese novel, or it may derive from the Genji clan, which won the 12th-century Genpei War. (Another, smaller firefly species, Aquatica lateralis, has the Japanese common name \\"heike-botaru\\", a possible reference to the Heike clan, the losers in the Genpei War). Description The male is long and wide. The female is larger, long and wide. The pronotum is reddish pink, with a central marking. The black elytra are elongate. In the male, the venter is brown and pale yellow, and in the female, it is brown, yellow and reddish pink. The male's luminous organ occupies its sixth ventrite. The antennae, about long, are between the eyes, which are well developed. The larva's body is soft, with gills. It has defensive organs that are eversible (can be turned inside out). Distribution and habitat This species occurs throughout Japan, except Hokkaido and Okinawa. There is one unconfirmed record from Korea. Its habitat is small ditches and streams, with mud or pebbles at the bottom. Adults are found from May to July. Behaviour and ecology Larvae of Luciola cruciata are aquatic; unable to swim, they crawl at the bottom. They prey on Semisulcospira libertina snails. Moriya S., Yamauchi T. & Nakagoshi N. (2010). \\"Sex ratios in the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) at emergence\\". Japanese Journal of Limnology 69(3): 255‚Äì258. . They have six to seven instars. The fireflies emerge from underground pupae around June. Maturity is reached in more than one year. Adults live for less than three weeks, and they do not eat anything. Their flash communication system is known as the \\"complex system\\". The flying males flash synchronously; the females do not fly while flashing, and their flashes are not synchronized. The male's flash pattern changes when it perches near a female, which emits single pulses. The male then approaches the female, and they copulate. In western Japan, there are two seconds between the male's flashes, and in northern Japan, there are four seconds. Intervals of three seconds occur between these two populations. The female lays 500‚Äì1000 eggs. In western Japan, females lay eggs in groups, but they are solitary in eastern Japan.

Early life De la Rive was born in Geneva, and originally studied law. During the Geneva revolution of 1794, he was a freedom fighter and later fled to Scotland with the physician Alexander Marcet. In 1797, he attained a doctorate of medicine from the University of Edinburgh while working with his teacher John Allen on the work Tentamen physiologicum inaugurale, de calore animali .... According to De la Rive, Allen believed that the body heat of animals is based on the combustion of food particles in the blood. After practising for a few years in London, where he visited several asylums, he returned to Geneva. Physician After his return, he became professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at the Geneva Academy in 1802 and of general chemistry in 1819, becoming rector in 1823. He was a physician in the hospice of the mentally ill as early as 1811, and he fought for the construction of an asylum adapted to advances in the science of mental illness, which was completed in 1838. He also worked at the British Library, writing on electricity and chemistry. Physicist In the summer of 1814 he was visited by Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday, and later Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re. In 1821 he sent Faraday a small apparatus with a floating wire loop that sensitively reacted to the approach of a magnet, which played an important role in Faraday's research. He also had the idea of a galvanometer based on the electrolytic decomposition of water, which was used by Amp√®re for determining the state of his voltaic piles. He wrote articles on electricity and chemistry for the magazine Biblioth√®que Britannique. He also supported Humphry Davy's views on electrochemistry, John Dalton's atomic theory and J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius's idea of definite proportions. In addition, De la Rive was politically active. He was a member of the Provisional Council (1813) and a Councillor of State (1814‚Äì1818), becoming the premier syndic of Geneva (1817‚Äì1818).

She was an influential female African American director and children's librarian of the Louisville Free Public Library, Western Colored Branch, one of the first segregated libraries built in the southern United States. She promoted library outreach to youths and equitable access to library services in the black community during the Jim Crow era. Early years Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Rachel Jewell Davis was the daughter of Susan Davis (later Susan Johnson). She was a graduate of Central High School in 1885. In Louisville, the illiteracy rate for blacks was very high in comparison to whites: 18.7% for blacks, 1.7% for whites. With a high school degree, Harris became a member of the upper echelon of the black Louisville community. Upon graduating, she began her career as a teacher from 1885 to 1903. During this time, Davis married the Rev. E.G. Harris, pastor of the black Plymouth Congregational Church, and they had one son. Career The Louisville Free Public Library opened the Western Colored Branch as a result of investment made by Carnegie funds. Alongside her mentor, Thomas Fountain Blue, Harris was hired as assistant librarian of the branch in 1905. Blue's passion for providing library services to the local black community influenced Harris to also push for more outreach, as well. The two librarians were Louisville's first black public librarians, acting as pioneers in creating a new municipal service for the black community in Louisville. Both were avid leaders in southern librarianship, actively writing and publishing articles locally and nationally. Working at the Colored Branch in Louisville, Harris gravitated toward working with youths in outreach programs. She established story times on a weekly basis, boys' and girls' clubs, and school visits to promote the library to school children. Harris also worked with school faculty in Louisville to develop classroom book collections that supported the curriculum being taught, culling on her years working as a teacher. Her early years taught her the importance of the availability of having access to reading material outside the classroom that was both entertaining and educational along with the need for classroom collections of books. In five years, Harris' outreach project was deemed a success. Harris' efforts had increased book circulations from 18,000 to 55,000 in her five-year tenure, allowing her to conclude: Harris' prominence in the African American community continued to rise throughout her years working at the Colored Branch. In September 1913, she was named senior assistant in charge of the newly opened Eastern Colored Branch, constructed with Carnegie funds. Alongside Blue, Harris began conducting an apprenticeship training program for individuals interested in working in libraries around the state. Many of the apprentices went on to work at the Western and Eastern Colored Branches. By 1924, 37 local black women had participated and received training from Harris and Blue. The program's success continued to reaffirm Harris' status in the Louisville African American and library communities. Her fame allowed her to open new branches for African Americans in Roanoke, Virginia and Georgetown, Kentucky. Harris continued to work with schools to expand collections and services in Louisville and Jefferson County. By 1923, 58 classroom collections had been established in 30 school buildings with Harris' influence. Blue died in 1935, allowing Harris to take his seat as head librarian of the Colored Branch. As head of the division, she worked with members of a Louisville community named Parkland to establish a sub-branch situated in a rented space of a private residence. In 1954, this library was replaced by a full branch in the new Cotter Homes Project. The building was named after Harris in recognition of her outreach efforts to Louisville's African American youth. Despite her retirement in 1942, Harris continued to be an avid supporter of library services in the black community in Louisville. Her knowledge encouraged many young black female librarians to be just as passionate regarding social issues and activism for local communities. Legacy Harris had a lasting impact on children's librarianship in Louisville and across the South. Her encouragement in the Western Branch to increase youth services marked her as one of the so- called \\"matriarchal profession\\" of librarians that introduced youths to folklore, fairy tales, and stories. Harris also followed in the pattern of the librarian as an educated, middle-class woman that served her community via encouraging development by focusing on the needs of children and their education. In this way, Harris assisted in the Civil Rights Movement that spread across the nation.

In June 1868, Hostlot finished at St. Francis Xavier College in Manhattan with highest honors. Desiring to enter the priesthood, he applied to the American College in Rome as a student of philosophy. Arrival in Rome Hostlot arrived in Rome and formally enrolled in the American College there on October 27, 1868. Hostlot was ordained to the priesthood early, on June 7, 1873. Afterward, while he was working on his doctorate, he was selected by the College's rector, Silas Chatard, to be his assistant. The prior vice-rector, Father Michael Mahoney, had died unexpectedly of a heart ailment at the young age of 25 in April 1874. Hostlot assumed the role of vice-rector on October 15, 1875. Two years later, his good work was evidenced by Chatard's praise of him to the Archbishop of New York, Michael Corrigan: \\"[he is] benemeritus for his labours, in that most thankless of all works, economizing.\\" Rector of the North American College In 1878, Silas Chatard was appointed as Bishop of Vincennes. Upon the departure of Chartard as the College's rector, Hostlot became pro-rector (that is, temporary administrator) of the American College. Although he was only 30 years of age, the officials of the Sacred Congregation considered him an able administrator and recommended him to the Pope for the rectorate. He was therefore formally appointed rector by Pope Leo XIII on December 9, 1878. He was subsequently made a supernumerary papal chamberlain in the beginning of 1879. During his term as rector, he was further promoted to the rank of domestic prelate with the title monsignor on December 17, 1883. According to American College historian Robert McNamara, Hostlot did not depart dramatically from Chatard's policies as rector. He also found the College's finances in good condition, helped in part by a steady rise in student registration. Given the increase in available funds, he was able to undertake several projects to expand and improve the College's property holdings. The first was the construction of a mortuary chapel in Rome's Campo Verano cemetery. Chartard had obtained the plot in 1874, but it is unclear whether the structure was completed by the time that the matter fell into Hostlot's hands. What is known is that the debt was paid by March 1879, during Hostlot's tenure. Secondly, repairs and enhancements were completed in the College itself, redecorating the interior and opening arches into the garden, and appointing a new sacristy for the chapel. In addition to those substantial tasks, Hostlot also succeeded in freeing up space in the building for accommodations to house 30 additional students. Finally, he purchased a villa for the use of the American seminarians in 1882. That property, located in Grottaferrata a few miles outside of the city, would be used for the lodging and recreation of the students during the hot summer months in Rome. The extent of his duties is adequately summed up by Hostlot himself, who wrote in a letter to his friend Father John Farley of New York in 1883: The North American College's mausoleum in the Campo Verano, which was constructed by the behest of Msgr. Hostlot's brother and sister in 1913. Despite his accomplishments, students at the time generally judged that Monsignor Hostlot was rather harsh in his governance of the school. It was remembered by students that he had a somewhat idiosyncratic practice of singing to his own accompaniment in the College's drawing room. If the music was cheerful, he could be approached and asked for favors; if not, \\"we would not dare look toward the Sala windows.\\" William Henry O'Connell, a student under Hostlot who would later go on to become rector of the College himself and eventually Cardinal Archbishop of Boston, remarked on the subject that \\"Poor Monsignor Hostlot meant well, but I know myself that he at the end regretted that he had held us off too far and was too much a martinet for a place like this.\\" The result of that ill will from the student body reached a head in Hostlot's attempted dismissal of the College's vice-rector, Father Francis Wall, in 1880. The attempted move broke the College into both pro- and anti-Hostlot camps, leaving a division that persisted even beyond Hostlot's subsequent appointment a new vice-rector. When Wall's successor, Father Hugh McDevitt, refused to continue on as Hostlot's assistant, the College's board was forced to investigate the issue. The list of charges against Hostlot has not survived, but the outcome was in his favor: the rumors of professional or personal malpractice were found to be either untrue or insubstantial, and he was kept on as the College's rector. In 1883, he chose as his vice-rector Augustine J. Schulte, a student priest from Philadelphia. Death and legacy By late 1883, however, Monsignor Hostlot's health took a turn for the worse. He became ill with a cold, which became so severe that by the day after Christmas 1883, he went to bed immediately after celebrating morning Mass. His ailment was probably influenza, which at that time was becoming epidemic in Rome. His doctors could not agree on a prognosis, with one suggesting that it was the green wallpaper of his bedroom that was causing his sickness. On January 31, 1884, he suffered a relapse that effectively eliminated any hope of recovery. That evening, he received Viaticum with devotion from the hands of the College's spiritual director, Ubaldo Ubaldi. At daybreak on February 1, 1884, Hostlot died at the age of 35. Despite his somewhat tumultuous term as rector, his good character and generosity were remembered by the \\"relatively large crowd of mourners\\" that came to view his body laid in state in the College's church of Santa Maria dell'Umilt√†. Afterwards, his remains were carried in procession to the nearby Basilica of the Holy Apostles. The celebrant of the funeral Mass was Domenico Jacobini, who was at that time Secretary of the Propaganda Fide. Hostlot was then buried at the College's new mortuary chapel in the Campo Verano. Hostlot was very generous in his will to the American College. He had set aside $5,000 for the foundation of a new student scholarship, which was to be accredited specifically to the Archdiocese of New York. Moreover, he directed that the 12,000 lira debt owed to him by the College should be forgiven and used to pay off the remaining balance on the villa in Grottaferrata. Soon after his death, his family established another scholarship in his memory. Nearly twenty years after Hostlot's death, his brother, John Hasslocher, contributed $500 towards the College's purchase of a new wing to expand their campus near Piazza della Pilotta. Finally, in 1913, John Hasslocher and his sister, Anna Ehret, financed the construction and adornment of the American College's current Romanesque mausoleum in Campo Verano. Upon the completion of that structure the remains of Monsignor Hostlot and most of the other deceased of the College were transferred to the new mausoleum, where they rest today.

A police officer and two civilians were killed; five police officers and four civilians were injured. After a standoff that lasted five hours, police SWAT teams crashed armored vehicles into the lobby and the attacker surrendered. The attacker, Robert Lewis Dear Jr., was arrested, charged in state court with first-degree murder, and ordered held without bond. At court appearances, Dear repeatedly interrupted proceedings, made statements affirming his guilt (although he did not enter a formal plea), and expressed anti-abortion and anti-Planned Parenthood views, calling himself \\"a warrior for the babies.\\" He also asserted his desire to act as his own attorney in the criminal case against him. Subsequent mental competency evaluations ordered by the state court determined Dear to be delusional. The judge presiding over the state case ruled in May 2016 that Dear was incompetent to stand trial and ordered him indefinitely confined to a Colorado state mental hospital, where he has remained ever since. In 2018, the court ruled that Dear remains incompetent to stand trial. In December 2019, separate federal charges were brought against Dear. The incident drew comments from the anti-abortion and abortion-rights movements, as well as political leaders.  Event   Shooting  Law enforcement responded to a report of an active shooter inside the Planned Parenthood clinic at approximately 11:38 a.m. MST. Staff inside the clinic said they heard the gunfire outside and then moved people out of the waiting room and locked a security door. As responding officers approached the building, the suspect fired at them, hitting several and killing one. Police returned fire and a five-hour standoff then ensued. Initial reports described the gunman as being armed with a long gun and wearing hunting gear. Authorities later identified the weapon as a semi- automatic rifle. An eyewitness in the parking lot described a man with a \\"cold, stone face\\" as he began firing and pursued a crawling man through the parking lot and into the clinic. Another described a man with \\"holes in his chest\\" stagger into a nearby grocery store a few minutes later, saying he had been shot in the parking lot between Planned Parenthood and the store. As many as twenty gunshots were fired within five minutes. Police swarmed the area, and nearby stores were put on lockdown.  Standoff and arrest  During the standoff, officers who made it inside the clinic traded fire with the suspect. Police SWAT teams crashed a Bear armored vehicle into the lobby, smashing two sets of doors and rescuing some of those trapped inside. The gunman subsequently surrendered and was taken into custody at 4:52 p.m. Following the apprehension of the gunman, law enforcement began searching the building, as well as the gunman's car, for possible explosives. Multiple propane tanks were found near the suspect's car, and authorities said they believed that he planned to fire on the tanks to trigger an explosion. At 9:10 p.m. the gunman was identified as Robert Lewis Dear Jr., a 57-year-old man from North Carolina. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were called to assist in the investigation, and President Barack Obama was briefed on the incident. As a precautionary response to the shooting, additional law enforcement personnel were assigned to Planned Parenthood clinics in New York City and Denver.  Victims  Three individuals were killed in the shooting: University of Colorado Colorado Springs police officer Garrett Swasey, 44, who responded to the shooting; Ke'Arre M. Stewart, 29, who ran back to the clinic to warn others after being shot; and Jennifer Markovsky, 35, who was accompanying a friend to the clinic. Nine other victims‚Äîfive police officers and four civilians‚Äîwere shot and admitted to local hospitals.  Perpetrator  Robert Lewis Dear Jr. (born April 16, 1958), aged 57 at the time of his arrest, was born in Charleston, South Carolina and grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. Dear spent most of his life in the Carolinas. He worked as an independent art dealer and lived in a succession of trailers and cabins before moving to Colorado in 2014. He was living in a trailer in Hartsel at the time of the shooting. In May 1991, Dear was arrested and convicted in Charleston, for the unlawful carrying of a \\"long blade knife\\" and illegal possession of a loaded gun. A woman who was married to Dear from 1985 to 1993 told NBC News that Dear had targeted a Planned Parenthood clinic before, by putting glue on its locks, and had a history of violent behavior. In the court document for their 1993 divorce, his ex-wife said, \\"He claims to be a Christian and is extremely evangelistic, but does not follow the Bible in his actions. He says that as long as he believes he will be saved, he can do whatever he pleases. He is obsessed with the world coming to an end.\\" Dear wrote on a marijuana Internet forum: \\"Turn to JESUS or burn in hell [...] WAKE UP SINNERS U CANT SAVE YOURSELF U WILL DIE AN WORMS SHALL EAT YOUR FLESH, NOW YOUR SOUL IS GOING SOMEWHERE.\\" He also posted notes on the same forum describing his own marijuana usage and stating that he was looking for women to \\"party\\" with. The New York Times also reported that \\"[a] number of people who knew Mr. Dear said he was a staunch abortion opponent\\", that \\"[o]ne person who spoke with him extensively about his religious views said [that] Mr. Dear [...] had praised people who attacked abortion providers, saying they were doing 'God's work'\\", and that \\"[i]n 2009, [...] Mr. Dear described as 'heroes' members of the Army of God, a loosely organized group of anti-abortion extremists that has claimed responsibility for a number of killings and bombings.\\" Dear's former wife said he was deeply religious, but conflicted, and that he likely targeted the clinic because of its abortion- related activities.  Investigation  Police said on November 29 that the warrants related to the case against Dear have been sealed because the investigation was active, and that consequently information about the timeline of events, the suspect's motive, and the weapon used would not be released \\"at this time.\\" According to an unnamed senior law enforcement official, first quoted by NBC News, Dear gave a \\"rambling\\" interview after his arrest in which he said at one point, \\"No more baby parts\\"‚Äîa statement that has been seen as a reference to the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. The unnamed official added that Dear \\"said a lot of things\\" in his police interview indicating that the shootings were \\"definitely politically motivated,\\" and that in the interview Dear had expressed anti-abortion and anti-government views. Dear is also alleged to have made statements about President Barack Obama in the course of events, prompting the U.S. Secret Service to dispatch agents to evaluate the remarks and interview him. According to an official close to the investigation, Dear asked at least one person for directions to the Planned Parenthood facility before the shooting, which, according to NBC News offered \\"the clearest suggestion yet that he was targeting the reproductive health organization.\\"  Legal proceedings  State charges On November 30, 2015, Dear was charged with first-degree murder and appeared in court (via video from the El Paso County Jail) and was ordered held without bond. If convicted, he would face either life in prison or the death penalty (although Colorado abolished the death penalty in 2020, the legislation was not retroactive). Dear was appointed a public defender: Daniel King, the same attorney who represented James Eagan Holmes, the convicted perpetrator of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. At the request of prosecutors, the judge ordered the sealing of court documents related to the investigation. The case was brought in Colorado's Fourth Judicial District before Judge Gilbert Anthony Martinez. Appearing in court on December 9 to be formally charged with 179 felony counts, including first-degree murder, Dear interrupted proceedings more than a dozen times, yelling: \\"I am guilty, there's no trial. I'm a warrior for the babies,\\" later adding \\"Protect the babies!\\" Dear stated \\"Kill the babies, that's what Planned Parenthood does\\" and accused his public defenders of conspiring with Planned Parenthood against him. The New York Times reported that Dear's \\"angry outbursts, declarations of guilt and expressions of anti-abortion politics ... seemed to remove any doubt about his motivation.\\" At the hearing, Dear also said: \\"You're not my lawyer\\" and \\"I will not meet with him again\\" and said \\"I'm not going to agree to mental health evaluations so they can't put me on psychotropic drugs so I can't talk like the Batman guy\\"‚Äîa reference to Holmes. At a hearing in December 2015, Dear attempted to fire his public defender, telling the court: \\"I invoke my constitutional right to defend myself.\\" Judge Martinez ordered Dear to undergo a mental competency evaluation at a state mental hospital to determine whether he is sufficiently competent to make the decision to represent himself. At a hearing in March 2016, Judge Martinez set a competency hearing for the following month, and Dear's counsel the judge to send his client to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo, the state mental hospital where the evaluation was done. In May 2016, Judge Martinez ruled that Dear was incompetent to stand trial, citing experts' finding that Dear suffers from \\"delusional disorder, persecutory type.\\" Martinez ordered Dear to be indefinitely confined to a Colorado state mental hospital. In February 2018, following further evaluations by state psychiatrists, the judge ruled that Dear remains incompetent to stand trial, meaning that the prosecution remains on hold indefinitely. Federal charges In early December 2019, a federal grand jury issued a 68-count indictment against Dear: 65 counts of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act) and three counts of using a firearm to murder. Dear was taken into custody Monday at the Colorado State Mental Health Institute in Pueblo, Colorado, where he has been detained since a state court declared him mentally incompetent to face trial on state charges in May 2016. At a plea hearing, Dear, who has admitted to being the shooter, again made several outbursts, again insisted that he was competent to stand trial, and complained about being held \\"at the nuthouse for four years.\\" Federal prosecutors requested that Dear undergo a new competency evaluation.  Reaction  Vicki Cowart, president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, decried the incident as a form of domestic terrorism. While the shooting was still ongoing, Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger demanded that Cowart apologize if the perpetrator was not anti-abortion. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the shooting \\"...not only a crime against the Colorado Springs community, but a crime against women receiving healthcare services at Planned Parenthood, law enforcement seeking to protect and serve, and other innocent people.\\" President Barack Obama released a statement on November 28, 2015 that stressed stricter gun control legislation. Some U.S. politicians and groups described the shooting as domestic terrorism, including Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, and former Republican Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said the shooting was \\"a form of terrorism\\" and said that it and other violent incidents may be the result of the \\"inflammatory rhetoric we see on all levels\\"‚Äîreferring to heated debate over abortion in the U.S. Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, drew particular attention to the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, two of which were shot at a clinic in Denver, 75 miles north of Colorado Springs; these videos resulted in a number of threats against one doctor featured in the videos. The FBI issued a statement to law enforcement agencies in September 2015 warning that Planned Parenthood facilities may require protection from arson attacks from \\"the pro-life extremist movement.\\" After the shooting, some police departments placed emergency response vehicles in the vicinity of Planned Parenthood clinics.

He was famous for his hymns and sermons, and also for missionary work with Catherine Pennefather. Catherine founded several projects in his name in the twenty years after his death. Early life He was born in Dublin, youngest son of the highly respected High Court judge Richard Pennefather, and his wife Jane Bennet. His father came from a long established family of landowners in County Tipperary, while his mother was the daughter of another High Court judge, John Bennett. One of his uncles was Edward Pennefather, a distinguished barrister and judge. Among his cousins was General Sir John Pennefather. He went to school first in Dublin, then to a private school at Westbury on Trym near Bristol, where he was nicknamed \\"the saintly boy\\". Due to his chronic ill-health he was then placed with a private tutor, Mr Stephens, at Levens near Kendal, Cumbria. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1834 but due to his constant health problems he did not matriculate until 1840. Early career Christ Church, Barnet- William was vicar here from 1852 to 1864. He entered holy orders in 1842. He became curate of Ballymacash, near Lisburn, in 1843 and of Mellifont the following year. During the Great Irish Famine he was noted for his charity to all those who lived in his parish, regardless of whether they were Catholics or Protestants. He then left Ireland, and spent the rest of his life working in England, mostly in or near London. In 1848 he was appointed vicar of Holy Trinity, Walton, near Aylesbury. This was a very difficult parish to work in as he had no vicarage and the income was small, but he is said to have gained the trust and respect of his parishioners. In 1852 he was transferred to Christ Church, Barnet, where he rapidly built up a considerable influence. For example, his parishioner Emma Robarts founded the Prayer Union, which decades later merged into the YWCA. His house in Barnet became a meeting place for evangelicals of all social classes and walks of life \\"from noblemen to farmers\\", and he began in 1856 a famous series of conferences on inter-denominational missionary work. Shortly before his arrival, the ancient village had been linked to central London by the opening of its railway station, making it easy to make and receive visits. There in 1860 he and his wife began to train deaconesses, a role similar to a nurse (not then a fully respectable occupation) and a social worker (then unknown). This became the Deaconess Institution, the first in the English-speaking world. When Florence Nightingale decided on a nursing career, she had to travel to Kaiserswerth to train with the deaconesses. Mildmay Mildmay Park railway station In 1864 the Pennefathers were transferred to St. Jude's Church, Mildmay Park; the annual assemblies became known as the Mildmay Conferences. Islington was undergoing great changes as Victorian housing sprawled over the ancient villages, and what had been built as desirable residences soon became overcrowded Dickensian slums. The Pennefathers rose to the occasion of the cholera epidemic of 1866, seeing it as an opportunity for domestic mission. The organisation he and his wife founded was the Mildmay Mission, judged \\"one of most influential home and overseas missionary organizations\\" in the country, \\"which led to founding of many other bodies\\".A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Islington: Undenominational missions', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8, Islington and Stoke Newington Parishes, ed. T F T Baker and C R Elrington (London, 1985), pp. 115-117. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol8/pp115-117 [accessed 20 July 2018]. The Deaconess Institution trained well-educated young women in theory and practice for two years at Mildmay, before sending them to full-time careers in outlying missions in London or further afield. There were \\"About 200 deaconesses at any one time; [their] distinctive uniform allowed them to work in roughest areas unmolested.\\" In 1869 the Pennefathers built a large hall at Mildmay, to host the annual conferences and to serve as the centre for several missionary organisations. The Conference Hall, abutting the south side of Newington Green, had three stories and sat up to 3000 people. It was used throughout the week by 20 organisations, and on Sunday the services were led by different denominations. Up to 600 men attended its night school. Mildmay founded or nurtured organisations such as the Dorcas Society, a charitable sewing circle; Caroline Hanbury's initiative to distribute flowers to hospitals; an orphanage training girls for domestic service; Mildmay Lads' Institute, to keep boys out of trouble; Metropolitan Free Dormitory Association, a homeless shelter involving Lord Shaftesbury; children's services, stimulated by a visit from American evangelist Edward Payson Hammond. The Railway Mission and the Young Women's Christian Association were for a time headquartered at Mildmay Mission. Mrs Pennefather brought together the Working Girls' Institute (founded 1855) to form the YWCA. Later life and legacy Mildmay Hospital He continued to hold conferences on missionary work until his sudden death on 30 April 1873. This interdenominational initiative, and his evident piety, were precursors of the Keswick Convention. The leader of the Church Mission Society, Eugene Stock, called him \\"the George Mueller of the Church of England\\". He was remembered as one of the most influential mission preachers of his time. He was the author of numerous hymns, of which probably the best-known is \\"Jesus, Stand Among Us\\". He also published several books of sermons. The Mildmay Conference Hall was demolished in the 1940s; council housing was built on its site. Mildmay is an HIV charity which traces its roots back to Pennefather and his Church-sponsored hospital.

In the United States, blacks are less likely than other ethnic groups to be religiously unaffiliated, let alone identifying as atheist. The demographics are similar in the United Kingdom. Atheists are individuals who do not hold a belief in a god or in a plurality of gods. Atheism is not a disbelief in gods or a denial of gods; it is a lack of belief in gods. Some, but not all, atheists identify as secular humanists, who are individuals who believe that life has meaning and joy without the need for the supernatural or religion and that all individuals should live ethical lives which can provide for the greater good of humanity. Black atheists and secular humanists exist today and in history, though many were not always vocal in their beliefs or lack of belief. Issues that face black atheists include the fact that they are \\"racially different\\" from the larger and more visible atheist movement and \\"religiously different\\" from the black community. Black atheists are often a minority group in their own countries and locations and then are an even smaller minority in the atheist group, which is itself often a minority. Sometimes, atheism is seen as a whites-only club by black people and in the United States, African American history, slavery and the civil rights movement are all closely tied to Christianity. Religion has very much become part of the tradition of black history and culture. Even when there is a strong atheist or secular humanist movement in the African Diaspora, it has been ignored. In surveys of history, black expressions of humanism and secularism have been ignored by historians.  Black atheism and religion  During the Harlem Renaissance, several prominent black authors in America wrote or discussed their criticisms of the Christian church in various forms. Anthony Pinn called Christianity a tool for keeping the status quo and historically, for supporting slavery. Michael Lackey sees African American atheism as a way to celebrate a \\"revolutionary victory\\" over what he perceives as an oppressive and violent god-concept. Many African American atheists see hope in a secular world view and find \\"religious culture a reason for melancholic mourning.\\" Similar views have been expressed by black atheists in the UK, some of which have roots in countries like Nigeria. These atheists are sorry to see religion having a deleterious effect on their homeland. African-American communities tend to believe that the church is the center of morality and often turn to the church to solve various social problems that the government is not being perceived to solve or care about. As writer Cord Jefferson put it, \\"For a long time, black houses of worship doubled as war rooms to plan protest actions and galvanize people made weary by centuries of racist violence and legislation.\\" Many black people have turned to religion to find the answers to their own suffering. In addition to the historic component of church and black life, many social problems are solved by churches who run local food banks, provide day care or job training. Many atheist African Americans see it as important to work with religious leaders and organizations to solve various social justice issues facing the community. African-Americans who come out as atheist may face a \\"prohibitive\\" social cost. Journalist Jamila Bey wrote, \\"It's difficult - if not impossible - to divorce religion from black culture.\\" This social cost is not unique to blacks who leave Christianity, but also occurs among black Muslims who leave the religion. Some atheists who have left Islam have been disowned by family or received death threats. Black atheists in the United Kingdom face similar problems, where coming out as an atheist is associated with the fear of being \\"ostracised and demonised.\\" For this reason London Black Atheists was formed in the United Kingdom by Clive Aruede and Lola Tinubu. At an atheist conference which took place next to a Christian conference in 2015, one of the black atheist attendees found herself attacked and accused by a black Christian woman for having a \\"slave mentality\\" and being \\"demon possessed.\\" However, when individuals stereotype African Americans as \\"religious\\" it ignores the \\"diversity of thought that actually exists within the black community.\\" In order to combat feelings of isolation, many black atheists turn to the internet or social media to become part of online atheist groups. As atheist groups which welcome black individuals grow and are more prominent, their number are also growing, suggesting that there has been a \\"silent stratum of America's black population quietly doubting.\\"  Atheism and racism  The overall atheist movement can be seen as \\"tacitly racist\\" in that \\"the movement is not generally interested in the issues that affect people of color\\" and racism becomes \\"invisible\\" and therefore difficult to talk about. Sikivu Hutchinson has written that there is a \\"staggering lack of interest\\" about issues facing black people from the atheist community. Some atheist groups see no reason to have separate organizations for black people and do not see or understand the different kinds of issues that black atheists face. Mandisa Thomas wrote that her own experiences \\"ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated, even ignored.\\" Atheism is also seen as racist by those outside of the movement. Debbie Goddard, director of the African Americans for Humanism recalls being told by fellow students in African-American studies that atheism and humanism were \\"harmful Eurocentric ideologies.\\" Goddard describes how atheism is seen by many black people as \\"not just a threat to religious beliefs and tradition, but also a threat to black identity and black history.\\" Christian apologist, Ray Comfort, said that atheism is \\"an insult to black heritage.\\" Sikivu Hutchinson has critiqued the Eurocentric and often \\"white supremacist\\" orientation of the mainstream atheist movement with regard to its predominantly white leadership and its obsession with church-state separation to the exclusion of racial justice, gender justice and redress of segregation. Hutchinson, Sikivu (26 November 2013) \\"Secularism and Social Justice,\\" Psychology Today, https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-humanity- naturally/201311/secularism-and-social-justice (Retrieved 24 February 2018)Anthony B. Pinn reminds readers of The Humanist that it's important to let black people set their own \\"racial justice agenda.\\" Black atheists face different issues than white atheists do and black atheists want their issues to be addressed. Sometimes the problem is just that individuals in atheist groups don't understand racism in general. As one black woman describes, she is often asked about her page which is called \\"Black Atheists.\\" She describes why calling titling the page isn't racist and that having a similar \\"White Atheists\\" page isn't equivalent because white people are not part of a marginalized group in the United States. Goddard has also experienced individuals who believed that it was racist to create special groups within atheism to appeal to African Americans.  Black women and atheism  Black women risk their own social status and reputation when they are active atheists. Hutchinson, Sikivu (1 October 2013) \\"Black Woman on the Atheist Tip,\\" For Harriet, http://www.forharriet.com/2013/10/black-woman-on-atheist- tip.html They are more likely to become estranged from their religious families, due to openly expressing their atheism. Within an already religious group, African American women make up \\"the most religious demographic\\" in the United States and when black women leave their religion, they also leave \\"an entire social system.\\" Women, in particular, are expected to be active in the church and feel the burden more strongly to be engaged in church life. In many black communities and churches, women are the binding force that holds it together. Sikivu Hutchinson notes that black women are expected to adhere to paradigms of moral and social \\"respectability\\" that make them more predisposed to being religious. Hutchinson, Sikivu (1 September 2018) \\"Respectability Among Heathens,\\" Humanism and the Challenge of Difference (New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2018)/ Women are the people who organize, arrange, fundraise, and make up the greatest number of attendees. A black woman's social position can be tied to the church. It is also thought that because women are the main parents in many households and play a large part in passing on culture and socializing children, they are expected to fulfill that role. Hutchinson, Sikivu, (1 February 2018) Moral Combat: Black Atheists, Gender Politics, and the Values Wars (Infidel Books: Los Angeles, 2011) By turning away from religion, it could be seen as turning away from their duties, their culture, and the religious reproduction of future generations. The atheist, non- religious and humanist movements continues to be dominated by white men in America. Greta Christina believes that much of atheist movement is still largely white because the movement itself has been subject to unconscious bias against diversity. Black atheist women are less visible than black atheist men. A piece in Salon, written in 2015, discusses how there are more women and people of color in the atheist movement than the \\"media would let on.\\" Despite the challenges facing black atheist women in the United States, many have stepped into leadership roles, creating atheist groups which are friendly to black participants. Mandisa Thomas has seen an increase in groups that are both secular and have more inclusive practices which welcome people of color and women. Hutchinson maintains that black feminist atheist and humanist activism challenges both Christian religious orthodoxy and white-dominated atheist/humanist orthodoxy. Black feminist atheist and humanist belief and praxis focus on changing the sexist, racist, classist and heterosexist institutional and systemic inequities that disenfranchise communities of color and women of color. Hutchinson, \\"Respectability Among Heathens\\" In response to black women's concerns about the \\"whiteness\\" of organized atheism and humanism, five black women atheists (Bridgette Crutchfield, Candace Gorham, Sikivu Hutchinson and Mandisa Thomas) were featured on the cover of the Humanist magazine in 2018 for the first time in the publication's history. Hutchinson, Sikivu (19 June 2018) \\"Why Five Fierce Humanists? A Comment on White Supremacy in the Movement,\\" The Humanist https://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2018/commentary/five-fierce- humanists (Retrieved 1 October 2019) In 2019, the first conference focusing on secular, humanist, agnostic, atheist and freethinking women of color was held in Chicago.Hutchinson, Sikivu (19 July 2019) \\"Still We Rise: The First Women of Color Beyond Belief Conference,\\" The Humanist, https://thehumanist.com/commentary/still-we-rise-the-first-women-of-color- beyond-belief-conference (Retrieved September 2019)  LGBT black atheists  Black atheists who identify as LGBT report that they have faced a large amount of \\"hate\\" coming from the \\"black community itself.\\" This may be due to the large sense of religiosity or other factors, according to The Huffington Post. Some criticize the lack of response some black churches have had with the current social issues black communities are facing. For example, gay acceptance is traditionally lower in black churches, as they tend to be more conservative. Many black churches openly oppose homosexuality, or they are completely silent on the matter. Some feel that strict church beliefs interfere with greater social issues affecting black communities. Many black churches have been slow to react to the HIV/AIDS issues affecting black communities. And some say that by stigmatizing homosexuality and HIV/AIDS, it could be making the issue worse for the communities affected. These critics think that since the black church is an integral part of many black communities, the church should be one of the leaders in affecting social justice and change. These and other factors can drive people away from the church and religion.  De-stigmatizing atheism  While many African Americans once used faith in religion to organize and galvanize people, there are more and more people seeing religion as part of the past. Sikivu Hutchinson believes that it is important to offer support structures for people leaving religion. Mercedes Diane Griffin thinks the atheist community should be more understanding and more \\"visible in communities of color.\\" In 2010, Jamila Bey called for black atheists to be proud of their atheism or agnosticism. Many new organizations and ways to recognize black atheists have been created. African Americans for Humanism (AAH), founded in 1989, has grown to become a transnational organization reflecting black humanist concerns around the world. In the United Kingdom, London Black Atheists was established to reach out to atheist members of the black community around London. The British Humanist Association has also reached out to support Black Pride Events. Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers (DoS) was started by Donald Wright in 2010. DoS is normally celebrated on the last Sunday of February. In order to increase awareness for black atheists, AAH ran a series of ads depicting free-thinking African Americans and contemporary atheists together with the tagline, \\"Doubts about religion? You're one of many.\\" Debbie Goddard said that the billboards were designed to help people see that there was a tradition of atheism and freethinking in the black community. In 2013 Black Skeptics Los Angeles created a college scholarship called \\"First in the Family\\" which helps children who grew up in difficult situations afford college.

Launched in Gothenburg she was delivered in April 1913. Coal fired, her bunkers had capacity for 16 days sailing at 10.6 tons a day. Four hatches, each with a steam winch, with a maximum capacity of a 3-ton lift. Early years Under the command of her first Captain, John Borg, she ran the route to D√ºsseldorf which required the ship to have a telescopic smoke stack and folding masts. The Captain changed in September 1914 to Captain G. Flygare. After World War I she sailed the Baltic/North Sea routes. On 16 September 1939 Vega, en route from Finland to Hull was captured, along with SS Suomen Poika by German submarine U-41 on her first patrol, at position 58N 04E. Taken to Cuxhaven where, found to be carrying goods to an enemy of Germany, her general cargo and timber was confiscated and unloaded. Being a neutral ship she was released on 4 October 1939. International Committee of the Red Cross The emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross (French: Comit√© international de la croix-rouge) Vega was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross in late 1939 for ‚Äúrelief activities‚Äù, to be based at Lisbon, Portugal, where it would work with the Cruz Vermelha Portuguesa. During the war period, Vega made 44 voyages for the Red Cross under Captain Wideberg. Thirty seven voyages from Lisbon to Marseilles between May 1941 to April 1944. Delivering supplies to the Croix-Rouge fran√ßaise in Vichy France in the Zone libre until November 1942, when following Case Anton, the German invasion of Southern France, Red Cross supplies were then delivered into Occupied France. Voyage No 38 was Lisbon to Toulon in November 1944 to a liberated France. Once in France, they were loaded onto railway cars and shipped to Geneva, Switzerland. Here, the International Committee of the Red Cross arranged for their shipment to PoW camps and other detention centers throughout Europe.British Red Cross: Food Parcels. Retrieved on 2010-09-26. Voyages 39 to 44, between December 1944 and June 1945, were made from Lisbon to the Channel Islands where the ship was met by the \\"Joint War Organisation\\" (the British Red Cross who had joined with St. John). Voyage 39 Permission was obtained to sail no earlier than 20 December 1944. German artillery observers on Guernsey spotted the ship at 10.40am 27 December 1944. Escorted by a minesweeper, M 4613 and with her radio transmitter disabled, she docked at Saint Peter Port Harbour at 17:50pm watched by a crowd of locals. The unloading by the Kriegsmarine was watched by a large crowd who lined the route from the harbour to the store where Red Cross Parcels would be stored prior to distribution. The parcels, donated by Canada and New Zealand, being transported on hand pushed rail trolleys to a storage depot in St George's Hall. Unloading was almost completed on 29 December and she sailed for Jersey next day. Unloading by German sailors and marines at Saint Helier harbour was completed on 3 January 1945. Vega then returned to Lisbon. The Honourable Herbert Morrison MP, speaking as Home Secretary in the British House of Commons on 18 January 1945 stated that ‚ÄúThe ship had sustained damage at the harbor at Guernsey,‚Äù which would require repairs, so delaying the second visit until around 25 January. The damage was to her bottom as she grounded at low tide, having been put in a berth designed for ships of up to 400 tons. She went into dry dock in Lisbon for repairs. Cargo comprised: 119,792 Red Cross food parcels, 4,200 invalid parcels, 4 tons soap, 5.2 tons salt, 37cwt medical supplies, cigarettes and some children's clothing. Voyage 40 Problems arose with the proposal to transport two members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as there was only one cabin available and only one space available in a lifeboat, should it be necessary. The extra person was given space in the Captain's cabin and the Captain agreed to breach the safety rules on crew numbers of 21. Sailed 1 February 1945, arrived Guernsey 7 February, departed 11 February, arrived Jersey 13 February, sailed for Lisbon 16 February, arriving on 21 February. Cargo comprised: 134,656 Red Cross food parcels, 4,200 invalid parcels, 5,465 kilos of tobacco and cigarettes, hearing aids, 20 tons of medical supplies, 200 kg seeds, shoe leather and salt. Voyages 41-44 The first three arrived in the Islands whilst they were still occupied, the last one was after liberation on 9 May 1945. These voyages each brought at least 500 tons of flour, with less food parcels. On voyage 43, the ship was docked alongside the Albert Pier in St Helier, Jersey when the Island was liberated from the occupying forces on 9 May. Presentations and gifts were made by the authorities in Jersey to Captain Wideberg and the crew, thanking them for bringing relief to the Islands. The work undertaken by Vega for the Red Cross, bringing parcels from Canada and New Zealand, saved many lives. After the war After voyage No 44, her work with the International Red Cross was finished and she sailed on 11 June 1945 to London where her Red Cross markings were painted out. In 1946 modifications were carried out by Middle Docks & Engineering Co Ltd in England to improve crew accommodation, which resulted in a raised bridge and more portholes. The gross tonnage changed to 1156. By 1954, the ship had reached the end of her working life and sailed across the Baltic to be scrapped at Travem√ºnde, in Germany. Commemoration In 1994 two plaques, one in the shape of a Red Cross overlapped with a ‚ÄúV‚Äù was unveiled at the berth where Vega had berthed in St Helier harbour, with a second small granite plaque at the Jersey Maritime Museum. A set of stamps was issued by Guernsey in December 2004 to commemorate memories of World War II. These included a picture of Vega. In 2013, to mark the 150th anniversary of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Jersey issued a set of postage stamps featuring Vega. Floats depicting Vega regularly appear at the Guernsey and Jersey Battle of Flowers, as well as Liberation Day celebrations with TV programs regularly mentioning the Red Cross work of Vega.

Northern Sweden has a cold climate with year-round snow, while the more southern parts have a more temperate climate. The country has an abundance of forests and mountains. It holds the largest population, as well as the largest area within the Scandinavian countries. Due to this, it has a strong influence over the rest of Norden. Sweden, in turn, serves as the fashion capital of Scandinavia. Sweden's capital, Stockholm, is the host of the country's biannual fashion week. As is the attitude surrounding most consumer products throughout Northern Europe, Swedish fashion embraces usefulness. Clothing is made to be practical and purposeful. This is largely due to the country's long history of harsh climatic conditions and its strong Lutheran background. Simplicity is also a common theme among the lines of Swedish fashion designers, meaning clothes tend to be more neutral toned with less intricate details. Clothes are not necessarily designed for the individual to stand out. There is a strong cultural influence that plays a role in this.  Swedish style  A Swedish fashion image from 1943. The long trench coat and hat provide protection from the outside climate, while still offering an aesthetic quality. Its use of neutral colour palettes, straight lines, and moveable designs supposedly differs from the other fashion capitals of the world that often showcase impractical luxury items made to stand out. Sweden embraces a region-wide mindset of owning and creating products that are just as functional as they are aesthetically pleasing, and clothing is not exempt from that criterion. Brands and designers Gudrun Sj√∂d√©n is a Swedish fashion designer known for a colorful line of clothes. Acne Studios is centered in Stockholm, Sweden and was created in 1996. It is the most recognized and universal brand from Scandinavia and an indulgent clothing line with styles for both men and women. They sell shoes, accessories, and clothing, with their denim being the item that got the business booming. Acne stores have expanded worldwide in a variety of countries, and they showcase their collections, as well as other art and design culture in the Acne Paper magazine that is published twice yearly. This high fashion label sells some of the bolder, more fashion-forward pieces in the Swedish fashion design world, though it still emphasizes simplicity. Rodebjer is a line designed by the Swedish person Carin Rodebjer that started in New York while she attended the Fashion Institute of Technology, though the original pieces were also sold to stores in Sweden. Rodebjer's clothes are now sold in twenty different countries. This brand sells adaptable clothing. J. Lindeberg is a collection that began in 1996 in Stockholm and New York. Created by Johan Lindeberg, this brand produces high fashion activewear with a prominence in golfing and skiing attire. Only the men's line sells non-sporty clothing, such as denim, knitwear, and suits. Both the menswear and womenswear collections have golfing and skiing specific items. H&M; (Hennes & Mauritz), possibly the most well-known Scandinavian fashion brand, is a Swedish based clothing line which began in 1947 in V√§ster√•s, Sweden, that has expanded worldwide. Starting out with only women's clothing, the company now sells men's, women's, and children's apparel, as well as home design products. Whyred was created by Sven ‚ÄúX:et‚Äù Erixon in 1999. The brand is known for its signature parka, a useful piece for the harsh winters of the Scandinavian region. The brand features purposeful items with added unexpected twists, to keep their designs moving forward. Elegance and modernism are the guiding forces behind this brand. Men's and women's everyday wear, outerwear, and more formal pieces are all part of the Whyred collection.  Fashion Week in Sweden  Fashion week in Sweden began in 2005, and is where roughly thirty designers biannually display their new collections in a series of fashion shows. It takes place in the city of Stockholm at Berns and Bukowskis. Designers put on their own shows to showcase their lines for the upcoming season. A show typically displays the spring/summer line or the fall/winter line. Fashion Week gives buyers a chance to give publicity to and talk about the designers' pieces and the general public a preview of what to expect come the change of season. Fashion week in Sweden was called off in 2019, due to increasing demands in sustainability.

She is best known for works featuring her character Ariadne, who is composed of a self-portrait and an appropriated portion of an illustration from Alice in Wonderland. Ramos currently lives in Miami, Florida, and serves as an artist in residence at Bakehouse Art Complex and a contracted exhibition artist at The Foutain Head Art Studios. She is also a renowned curator in Cuba, and she won a national award for her curatorial work on the exhibition La Huella M√∫ltiple (Multiple Fingerprint) in 2003 from the Consejo Nacional de las Artes Pl√°sticas (CNAP) in Havana, Cuba. Early life and education Sandra Ramos Lorenzo was born in Havana, Cuba, to two native Cuban parents, and she now lives in Miami, Florida. Although Ramos doesn't come from a family of artists, she was nonetheless still heavily inspired by painter Gloria Gonz√°lez who was a close friend of Ramos‚Äô grandmother. Ramos has two siblings still living in their family home in Miramar, Havana. Her sister Liane, who has degrees in curatorial work, gives tour of Ramos‚Äô Havana studio and runs small xylographic workshops as her assistant. Ramos' brother Ruben also helps to run printmaking workshop at the studio. From 1984 to 1988, Ramos pursued a high school diploma at the prestigious Elemental School of Visual Arts 20 de Octubre at San Alejandro Art Academy, which was famously attended by Fidel Castro and Jose Mart√≠, and from 1988 to 1993 she worked on attaining a degree in printmaking the Superior Institute of Art in Havana where she was instructed by notable artists like Jos√© Bedia, Leandro Soto and Carlos C√°rdenas, among others.Santiago, Fabiola. \\"For Cuban Artist, Her Nation Drowns in Rain, the Ocean and Tears.\\" Knight Ridder Tribune News Service: 1.

Ramos' career as an artist began during Cuba's \\"Special Period.\\" This period began in 1990 and was a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union (USRR) and the embargo that the United States imposed on Cuba.Marseglia, Paul. \\"Cuban Artist Opens Exhibit at Arts on Douglas.\\" Daytona Beach News - Journal, The Jul 17 2014. ProQuest. Web. 25 Oct. 2015. Cuba's ‚ÄúSpecial Period‚Äù was marked by a declining economy that negatively affected the quality of life of all Cubans. During this period of time, many people left Cuba, including her then-husband who left in 1992. In reference to this experience, Ramos stated, \\"It was a very hard time for me‚Ä¶ I had to decide whether I was going to follow him or not.\\" . Ramos decided to stay. The personal experiences that derived from these hardships are what propelled the content of her work, which communicated a sense of isolation, grief, and loss. In 2003, the artist hinted at the way in which her experiences of living in Cuba affected her art by saying, \\"My work is too related to my life there and my life would change a lot if I left.\\" In 1993 Sandra Ramos became a teacher at the ISA - Higher Institute of Art, a job that she held up until 1998. Since then, she has continued her involvement in the art world. According to her website, ‚Äú‚Ä¶she has being Curator of the 7 editions of La Huella M√∫ltiple event and other Cuban Contemporary Art exhibitions. She imparted conferences and workshops in International Institutions and Universities as the CUNY Graduate Center of New York, the Wake Forest University of Winston-Salem, the George Mason University of Fairface County, the University of Havana, the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts of Paris, the Barbican Center of London, the School of the Fine Arts Museum in Boston, Lowe Art Museum and University of Florida in Miami, Fuchu Art Museum, Tokyo, among others.. Ramos‚Äô first attempt to enter the United States was in 2004 for her first solo gallery exhibition in the U.S. at the Fraser Gallery Georgetown. However, her visit was forbidden by the U.S. department of state because ‚Äúin a bid to increase pressure for democratic change in Cuba by drying up the flow of hard currency to the Castro regime, the U.S. government had tightened restrictions on travel by Cuban artists to the United States.‚Äù‚ÄúSandra Ramos sees ‚ÄòSorrows‚Äô.‚Äù The Washington Times. May 28, 2004 In February of 2014, following much of her family and friends, Ramos moved to Miami, Florida to work as an artist in residence at The Fountain Head Art Studios, and, in September of 2016, she began a second residency at the Bakehouse Art Complex also located in Miami, both of which she still maintains.‚ÄúSandra Ramos.

Ramos‚Äô works have been incorporated into the permanent collections of many museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Fuchu Art Museum in Japan. Ramos' work is also a part of the Rodr√≠guez Collection at the Kendall Art Center in Miami, Florida.Kendall Art Center The Rodr√≠guez Collection, POEMS: Sandra Ramos, BEING, March 10, 2017. Ramos‚Äô works featuring her character Ariadne have sold for as much as 833% above their estimated value. Style and technique Ramos uses a variety of mediums for her art, which include, paintings, etchings, collage, installations, and digital animation. However, the medium for which she is most renowned is woodblock printing. Ramos first learned engraving techniques at her high school and still uses some of the same techniques. Most commonly Ramos produces images using aquatint, an etching technique that only produces areas of tone rather than lines. When speaking about what artistic medium she prefers, Ramos stated: \\"While engraving (woodblock) continues to be my favorite medium, I wanted to expand the expressive and communicative potential of my work through a new digital medium. Digital animation allows me to elevate my storytelling capabilities by creating a temporal continuity for my small vignettes\\". Themes Ramos has been explicit about how her art, not only intersects with social, political, and global issues, but also is made with intent of making a critical statement about the future. She does this by using a paradox of contradictions of idealism. In her art, she expresses deep feelings of loss and mourning that are associated with choices of her family, friends, and her partner in life. She explores the trauma that came with the break of all of these ties and the consequent feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that ensued. In addition, she is known for the visual expression of her relationship to Cuba's political and social realities, especially those that relate to the Cuban diaspora. Throughout her body of work, the artist uses familiar characters from literature, history, and folklore that not only creates context for her work, but also voices her political or social opinions.‚ÄúSandra Ramos - Newsletter 2014.\\" Sandra Ramos -Newsletter 2014 (n.d.): n. pag. Sandra Ramos Art. Sept. 2014. Web. 25 Oct. 2015. One common motif in her work is using a character named Ariadne. The artist presents Ariadne as a young girl whose visage seems innocent, guiltless, and unaware of life's struggles.Dawson, Jessica. \\"Framed by Politics; in the Art of Max Beckmann and Sandra Ramos, Context is Everything.\\" The Washington PostJun 10 2004. ProQuest. Web. 25 Oct. 2015. The character's face is a self-portrait of the artist that is utilized in a surreal context similar to that of the protagonist from Alice in Wonderland. The artist appropriates this fictional context to make commentary on life in contemporary Cuba. Her work lends itself to be a narrative that plays on the adventures of Alice in Wonderland, but instead her character is a childlike explorer of Cuba under the Fidel Castro regime. By choosing to name her character Ariadne, Ramos alludes at Greek mythology. Ariadne is the name of goddess who is the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his wife Pasiphae. In her story, she falls in love with Athenian hero, Theseus, and plays a crucial role in helping him slay the Minotaur. In return, she expects him to marry her and to take her back to Athens. However, Theseus abandons Ariadne on the island of Naxos (Connor). Another common theme in Ramos‚Äô piece is the use of water that emphasizes a physical separation to express a sense of isolation and to, as well as demonstrating the fluidity in her life.

Critical reception When speaking about the artist, Cuban art critic and curator Gerardo Mosquera, Ramos is ‚Äú.. an artist who surrenders her biography, her most intimate feelings and her own body to discuss social, political and cultural problems, has said of her work‚Ä¶She uses her portrait to personify the Cuban flag, the island, establishing a parallel between her personal situation and the suffering of her own country.\\" Mayer Fine Art Gallery in Norfolk, Virginia, calls Ramos's work ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù and says she is ‚Äúamongst the first to challenge and expose the harsh realities of Cuban life. By addressing forbidden issues such as mass migration, the plight of Cuba‚Äôs raft people, racism in Cuban society and the inequalities of Cuban life, Ramos found a voice through her art that has brought her worldwide fame.‚Äù In 2017, an exhibition featuring Ramos‚Äô work, ‚ÄúOn the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art,‚Äù at the Perez Art Museum Miami received criticism from Miami's Cuban exile community for its inclusion works by artists who depict the island fondly before it even opened.

As a fourteen year old, Adamic immigrated to the United States in 1913 from Carniola (Kranjska), at that time a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In Adamic‚Äôs words, Laughing in the Jungle was an attempt to explain his experiences as an immigrant to America.Louis Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle. The Autobiography of an American Immigrant (New York and London: Harper&Brothers;, 1932), ix. The title of the book, Laughing in the Jungle, was inspired by Upton Sinclair‚Äôs 1906 book The Jungle. Adamic for the first time learned about the book from his Carniolan neighbor, Peter Molek, who said to him that ‚Äúthe whole of America is a jungle‚Ä¶ [that] swallows many people who go there to work.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 17. At first, Adamic did not understand Molek‚Äôs point, but after sixteen years in America, he came to believe that the United States ‚Äúis more a jungle than civilization‚Äù where one can survive only with ‚Äúknowledge and understanding of the scene, with a sense of humor.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, ix, 220.  Summary  Laughing in the Jungle is divided into five parts and 24 chapters. Adamic‚Äôs book generally adhered to the chronological order of events, beginning with his arrival in 1913 until 1929 when his story ends. However, his narrative is centered on several individuals that he encountered in the United States. Each of his acquaintances, according to Adamic, symbolized certain characteristics of American life. ‚ÄúHaphazardness, chaos, violence, and accident had ruled their lives.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 324. The book begins with an Adamic's explanation why he came to America. His small village provided a steady stream of immigrants to the United States. Adamic recalled how these men symbolized affluence and success. Their stories depicted America as a fantastic place, geographically vast, and in constant motion. Under the influence of these images, Adamic wrote that he ‚Äúplayed with the idea of going to America‚Äù when he was already eight or nine years old. However, his neighbor Molek, one of those who returned from the United States, sick and broken, told him stories about exploitation, work accidents, slums, and misery of immigrant life. Molek said that the immigrants were the ‚Äúdung‚Äù that fertilizes the roots of America‚Äôs greatness. ‚ÄúAll of which, on top of what I had previously heard and thought of America, tended to bewilder me,‚Äù admitted Adamic.Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 20. While in high school in Ljubljana, Adamic became associated with the Yugoslav Nationalist Movement. Their demonstrations provoked a violent response by Habsburg authorities that left his best friend dead and led to his arrest and expulsion from high school in 1913. Since Adamic was banned from all educational institutions in the Empire, a family member offered to get him into the Jesuit School. To avoid the school, Adamic decided to go to America. On board the ship Niagara, Adamic arrived in New York on December 30, 1913. His participation in anti-Austrian demonstrations allegedly earned him a certain fame in Slovene immigrant circles in New York.John L. Modic, \\"Laughing in the Jungle: The Writer as Hero,\\" Slovene Studies Journal, vol. 4 no. 2 (1982): 113-122. Available at https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/ssj/article/viewFile/3516/2929. Modic clarifies that the episode of Adamic's participation to the riot of 1913 in Ljubjana is completely fictional, as other episodes of his autobiography. Soon after he arrived, Adamic obtained a job on a Slovene newspaper, Narodni Glas (Peoples' Voice). Life in New York caused him ‚Äúa deep and heavy sense of bewilderment.‚Äù He realized that ‚Äúto know and understand‚Äù America he first had to learn the language. Adamic briefly attended an evening school, but soon realized ‚Äúso far as my understanding of America was concerned, I was left almost entirely to myself.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 77. He was a voracious reader and at the age of sixteen, he read Sinclair‚Äôs Jungle which profoundly influenced his thinking about America. ‚ÄúFor a few days I felt a sharp hatred for the whole country.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 79. Laughing in the Jungle describes Adamic‚Äôs visits to South Slav and Central European immigrant communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio. He characterized his trip as ‚Äúa depressing one.‚Äù He was appalled by his compatriots‚Äô inability and unwillingness to assimilate, but even more by sordid living conditions in which these people lived. When Narodni Glas closed, he was forced to work manual jobs where he learned about ‚Äúthe harsh actualities of American industrial life.‚Äù Adamic was disgusted by his fellow workers, mostly European immigrants, who he described as ‚Äúhopeless,‚Äù ‚Äúselfish,‚Äù and ‚Äúuninspiring.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey did not belong in America. They knew nothing of the country, nor had the ability or desire to learn about it,‚Äù Adamic wrote.Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 114. Yet, Adamic cautioned, one could not ‚Äúafford to plunge too far into the economic and social issues of American life.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 239. The next portion of Laughing in the Jungle describes how Adamic quit his industrial job in 1917 and joined the US Army. While stationed in Panama, he learned what the actual jungle was, and thought of it as the appropriate analogy of America, ‚Äúwhere everything strives to grow, to get better of the next thing.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 167. Adamic spent a short time on the Western Front, and after he was discharged from the Army in 1921, he found himself again doing menial jobs. In a search of work, he moved to Los Angeles in 1922. Adamic believed that Los Angeles was the essence of the United States. ‚ÄúLos Angeles is America. A jungle.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 219. He settled in San Pedro, a suburb with a large South Slav community that earned it the moniker ‚ÄúBalkan States.‚Äù On the bulletin board of the San Pedro Library, Adamic saw an ad for an examination for the position of port pilots‚Äô clerk. He felt that he ‚Äúwas just the fellow for it.‚Äù Adamic passed the exam and in 1924 he received the appointment. ‚ÄúThus began four very pleasant and peaceful years in my life. The position of municipal port pilots‚Äô clerk was ideal for me,‚Äù Adamic wrote.Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 261. After he got a comfortable white-collar job, Adamic dedicated his time to writing. ‚ÄúAfter my stories appeared in the Mercury or elsewhere, I received letters of commendation from F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Stevens, Carey McWilliams‚Ä¶ people whose judgment I respected.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 327. He attributed his success to his personal policy toward the United States ‚Äúof a bystander and onlooker.‚Äù ‚ÄúI ‚Äòplayed safe‚Äô,‚Äù as a sensible adventurer should do in a jungle,‚Äù cautioned Adamic his readers.Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 327. Laughing in the Jungle revolves around three motifs. Adamic in his book often used metaphors of ‚Äújungle‚Äù and ‚Äúdung,‚Äù but also the theme of laughter as a form of resistance and survival. For Adamic, America was the jungle that grew ‚Äúplanlessly‚Äù[sic] and provided an opportunity for ‚Äúinferior‚Äù and ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù plants to flourish before they inevitably succumb to chaos and decay.Adamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 219. The growth was provided by an abundant supply of ‚Äúdung‚Äù made of invisible masses, both immigrant, and native, who were ‚Äúfertilizing the roots of America‚Äôs material greatness.‚ÄùAdamic, Laughing in the Jungle, 324.  Reception  Laughing in the Jungle received mostly positive reviews. Eda Lou Walton noted that Adamic‚Äôs book was more interesting for ‚Äúits material than for its style.‚ÄùEda Lou Walton, Review of Laughing in the Jungle, by Louis Adamic, The Bookman (March 1932): 688-689. Available at http://www.unz.org/Pub/Bookman-1932mar-00688a02 She criticized his writing as unsensational and not ‚Äúparticularly fine,‚Äù and without purpose. Yet, Walton noted that Adamic‚Äôs observations of ‚Äúalmost every phase of the American scene‚Äù and book‚Äôs ‚Äúutter realism‚Äù were the main force of the book. According to the Saturday Review of Literature, Laughing in the Jungle ‚Äúleaves out much of America.‚Äù Yet, the book, as Harry Laidler wrote, was ‚Äúa most welcome addition to our social literature‚Äù because of its ‚Äúlively, refreshingly frank and accurate description‚Ä¶[and] it portrays a side of the country which many smug native sons are utterly unaware of.‚Äù Harry Laidler, \\"The American Scene,\\" review of Laughing in the Jungle, by Louis Adamic, The Saturday Review of Literature, March 28, 1932, p. 755. Available at http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1932may28-00755a02 John R. Adams from the San Diego Union noted that Laughing in the Jungle is ‚Äúexcellently written autobiography‚Ä¶ [that] is more than a stimulating record of how one immigrant made good.‚ÄùJohn R. Adams, Review of Laughing in the Jungle, by Louis Adamic, The San Diego Union, April 3, 1932, p. 6. He noted that the book should be particularly interesting to Californians because Adamic spent his best years in San Pedro. Adams recommended the book because ‚Äúthere was comparatively little theorizing‚Äù in it. The only relatively negative review came from the New Republic‚Äôs Robert Cantwell. He wrote that Laughing in the Jungle is ‚Äúdisheartening book, a book containing a wealth of material left like raw ore because of some faulty process of selection.‚Äù Robert Cantwell, ‚ÄúBronx Cheers,‚Äù review of Laughing in the Jungle, by Louis Adamic, The New Republic, no. 912, vol. 71, May 25, 1932, p. 51. Cantwell criticized Adamic‚Äôs accounts of America as distorted and inauthentic because Adamic saw America through the eyes of H. L. Mencken. He wrote that the Laughing in the Jungle was a tribute to the ‚ÄúSage of Baltimore,‚Äù because Adamic simply reiterated many Mencken‚Äôs thoughts about capitalism and democracy. Cantwell saw this as the main shortcoming of the book, at the same time he accused Adamic for the lack of ingenuity.  Importance  Adamic's book is a good source for the history of South Slav and Eastern and Central European immigrants (‚ÄúBohunks‚Äù) in the United States. Louis Adamic‚Äôs immigrant fate was uncommon, but his observations about his compatriots and their life in America provide a window to observe ordinary ‚ÄúBohunks‚Äù who ‚Äúlived hectic, uncertain lives.‚Äù Laughing in the Jungle is more than a good ethnographic record of their lives. Adamic‚Äôs descriptions of the Slavic communities addressed some larger issues of American immigration history.

It is rounded with bright green foliage as a young shrub and roughly fissured, dark grey bark when mature. Sugarwood is endemic to the southern half of continental Australia. Description Sugarwood is a rounded shrub or small tree growing to a height of with foliage and branches that are glabrous but often covered with small raised, wart-like tubercles. The bark on mature specimens is rough, dark grey, flaky bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are usually long, wide, linear to elliptic in shape and usually have small teeth or serrations in the outer half. The leaves are often curved or have a hook on the end and both surfaces are deep green in colour. The flowers are borne in groups of about 5 to 8 (sometimes more or fewer) on a stalk long. The flowers have five triangular sepals and five petals, joined at their bases to form a tube. The petals are white or very pale pink to purple sometimes spotted orange or yellow. The tube is about long and the lobes are spreading, blunt and long. The inside of the tube and part of the lobes are hairy. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. The main flowering season is from August to November and the fruits that follow are green and fleshy at first but dry when mature. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum platycarpum was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae in 1810. There are two subspecies: * Myoporum platycarpum R.Br. subsp. platycarpum has petal lobes that are shorter than the petal tube and as a mature tree has curved or bending branches; * Myoporum platycarpum subsp. perbellum Chinnock has petal lobes that are equal to or longer than the petal tube and as a mature tree has straight branches. The specific epithet platycarpum is derived from the ancient Greek platys (œÄŒªŒ±œÑœçœÇ), broad, flat; karpos (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ), fruit.Backer, C.A. (1936). Verklarend woordenboek der wetenschappelijke namen van de in Nederland en Nederlandsch-Indi√´ in het wild groeiende en in tuinen en parken gekweekte varens en hoogere planten (Edition Nicoline van der Sijs). The epithet perbellum is from the \\"Latin, perbellum very beautiful\\". Distribution and habitat Both subspecies of M. platycarpum occur in inland areas of New South Wales, north-western Victoria and the southern half of South Australia. Only subspecies platycarpum occurs in south-eastern Western Australia and in the far south east of Queensland. It often grows in mallee or Belah woodland.

He was born in Morpeth, New South Wales and died at South Littleton, Worcestershire. Background and family Waddy came from a family of cricketers: his brothers Edgar Lloyd Waddy (Gar) and Percival Stacy Waddy (Stacy) both played first-class cricket. He was educated at the King's School, Parramatta and at the University of Sydney, and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England, serving in the 1900s as the curate in the parish of Singleton, New South Wales, where his brother Stacy was the vicar. Australian cricketer As a cricketer, Waddy was a right-handed batsman sometimes used as an opener, though his highest score was made batting at No 7; he also bowled right-arm medium-pace, but took no wickets in his three overs in first-class cricket. After a single unsuccessful appearance in first-class cricket for New South Wales in 1902‚Äì03, he returned to the team in 1904‚Äì05 and was immediately successful, scoring an unbeaten 129 in his first match of the season, the game against South Australia, this being the highest score of his career. He retained his place in the New South Wales team for the major Sheffield Shield matches for the next four seasons, though he was not always successful: in 1906‚Äì07, he managed just 46 runs in five innings across the four matches in which he played. He returned to form in 1907‚Äì08, however, when he averaged 63 runs per innings and hit two centuries. In the New South Wales match against the touring England team he scored an unbeaten 107 and a second innings 57. After this, he was added as emergency cover twelfth man to the Australian team for the fifth Test match, though he was not required to play. And at the start of the 1908‚Äì09 season, there was newspaper speculation that he could be in line for the 1909 Australian Test tour to England. But Waddy then had a mediocre season and his cricket career in Australia declined to the point where he played his last first-class match there only two seasons later. Waddy also had a career change, though remaining alongside his elder brother: the newspaper report of his marriage in December 1908 to Margaret Helen Christie, matron of the Croydon Cottage Hospital, states that he was employed as a schoolmaster at the King's School, Parramatta, where his brother Stacy had become headmaster. After he ceased from playing, Waddy remained influential in New South Wales cricket, acting as a selector. In the 1913‚Äì14 season, he organised and captained a tour of Ceylon by a New South Wales side that included several former players, among them Test cricketers Roy Minnett and Gerry Hazlitt. The team won eight of its nine matches, and the tour was a considerable success both on and off the field in improving the relations between Ceylon and Australia. In January 1914 Waddy made a splendid century against the Planters at Kandy. In England In 1915, Waddy moved to England, taking up a post as a mathematics master at Rugby School; he remained there, becoming a house master, until 1940. When first-class cricket resumed in England in 1919 after the First World War, Waddy, qualified by residence, played in the school holidays for Warwickshire. He had some success in the first three years, scoring a final century, an unbeaten 109 made out of a total of 229, in the 1921 match against Middlesex at Lord's. He was unsuccessful in 1922 and did not appear in first-class cricket after that season, though he continued in club cricket into the 1930s. On retirement from Rugby School, Waddy became the vicar of South Littleton in Worcestershire where he died in 1958.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and is a contributing property to the Cherryfield Historic District. The property is owned by Gordon and Cynthia Kelley. Description and history The Nash House is set at the junction of River Road and School Street on the west side of the Narraguagus River, opposite the central portion of Cherryfield village. It is a large and rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full third floor. Its front facade is three bays wide, with a three-story hip- roofed tower projecting from the center. A single-story porch extends across the front, with turned posts and a modillioned entablature. A balcony projects from the front of the tower on the second level. The earliest date of construction of surviving portions of this house are not known. It was originally a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, which was converted by James Moore into a Greek Revival structure with a classical temple front. Moore son-in- law, William Nash, inherited that house, and retained local architect William Allen to update it in 1888 to the Second Empire style. It is not known if any portion of the original Cape survived both transformations of the house. Of Allen's works (which are predominantly to be seen elsewhere in Cherryfield), it is the most elaborate known.

When the parade season ended in 2014, the New Orleans city government spent $1.5 million to pick up about 1,500 tons of Mardi Gras- induced waste, consisting mostly of beads. This is a recurring problem every year for the city. In addition, the city must also deal with the environmental repercussions endured after Mardi Gras. Because they are not biodegradable and contain high amounts of heavy metals, Mardi Gras beads put the local environment and health of southern Louisianians at risk. Bead composition Polyethylene and polystyrene are popular plastics used in beads. Polystyrene is very stable and can last for many decades as the beads lay in landfills. Eventually, it will begin to slowly oxidize via UV light from the sun. In contrast, polystyrene cannot decompose with UV radiation and biodegrades extremely slowly. Lead, cadmium, and other elements have been detected in beads in extremely high amounts through various analytical techniques. Many of these elements exceed the suggested safety limits set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. For example, the safe amount of lead in a product is 100 ppm; however, there have been findings where the amount of lead in a bead surpassed the limit 300 times over. This threatens parade-goers with exposure to high amounts of lead, especially younger children that could potentially put the beads in their mouths. History Plastic beads weren't always a part of Mardi Gras; they were introduced only in the late 1970s.  Entry into the environment  Beads can accidentally enter storm drains, which empty into Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, which drains into the Gulf of Mexico. The metals in the beads put fish and other marine lifeforms at risk for lead and cadmium poisoning. Exposure to these metals in water causes high mortality rates and increased biomass of these metals among fish species within a month of exposure. Seafood is prevalent in the south Louisiana diet, most of which is harvested from the Gulf. Eating seafood contaminated with lead and cadmium puts people at risk for poisoning. Beads also can get tangled in trees during parades. Here, the lead in the beads can get washed off via rain water and find its way into leaves and soil. Lead has been shown to be an inhibitor of cell division, water uptake, and photosynthesis, eventually causing death to the plant.  Impact on humans  Lead exposure has been evidenced to significantly inhibit neurological function. One study examined identical twins who worked together as painters using lead-based paint. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, it was discovered that they both had lead levels in their bones about 5-10 times more than the average adult. One twin put himself at a higher risk of lead exposure because he was the only one that removed paint on the job. His lead concentration was 2.5 times higher than his twin‚Äôs; and after further testing, his memory was shown to be much worse than his twin‚Äôs. Cadmium has been shown to be carcinogenic due to interactions with DNA topoisomerase IIŒ±. This enzyme helps facilitate cell division and DNA repair, specifically with double strand breaks. Cadmium cations react with the topoisomerase in the following manner: 8 Cd2+ \\\\+ topoisomerase IIŒ± ‚Äì 8H --> topoisomerase IIŒ± ‚Äì 8 Cd2+ Here, the cadmium ions react with sulfur-containing thiol groups in cysteine residues, effectively ruining the structure and function of the topoisomerase.  Solutions  Polylactic acid monomer Mardi Gras will unlikely be cancelled due to its popularity, cultural significance, and economic importance, but a concerted effort can still be made to curb the negative environmental effects of the beads. One suggested avenue is to replace currently used plastics with polylactic acid (PLA), an environmentally much more friendly material. This polymer can be degraded naturally into lactic acid via hydrolysis or self-hydrolysis, which decomposes whole PLA products in as quickly as a month. A second way is to ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù by purchasing used beads rather than buying new ones, which can also translate into cost savings for individual purchasers or re-sellers who buy the beads in large quantities; recycling also provides an environmentally friendly method of \\"disposal\\" for those who initially purchased Mardi Gras beads. Another alternative that has an exponentially reduced environmental impact is to impose restrictions on the presence of the current Mardi Gras beads, such as banning them altogether but permitting non-toxic, eco-friendly alternatives such as beads made from paste, paper, clay, wood, or even vegetables (peas painted with a water-based, non-toxic paint, for example). Some cities and communities in the United States have successfully banned plastic bags, so this would not be an impossible goal. To support and enforce the restriction on toxic beads and ensure implementation of the non-toxic alternatives, the City of New Orleans could also begin imposing a substantial tax or fee on vendors, entertainers, attendees, and other individuals and businesses associated with Mardi Gras to alleviate the hefty financial cost of clean-up that the city itself must bear every year.

He was born in Enfield Highway, Middlesex and died at Small Heath, Birmingham. Cricket career Whitehead was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm bowler who could bowl both off-breaks and medium-pace. He was a professional cricketer and had playing and coaching engagements at Oxford, Malvern and Rugby at the time of his death, and was also playing for Stratford-on-Avon Cricket Club. He played for Warwickshire from 1886, but the county's matches were not regarded as first-class until 1894. Among his non-first-class matches for Warwickshire was the first match at the Bristol County Ground at Ashley Down, Bristol against Gloucestershire in which he ended W. G. Grace's first innings on the new ground by bowling him. His first first-class games were for the Liverpool and District side in 1891 and 1892, in matches against Yorkshire which the Liverpool side won in both years. From 1894, Warwickshire's games against other first-class sides were also considered to be first-class, though the team did not join the County Championship until 1895. In 1894, Whitehead, alongside Henry Pallett, formed part of an extremely successful bowling line- up, and he took five wickets in an innings five times, on four occasions going on to take 10 or more wickets in a match. His best bowling performance came in Warwickshire's first first-class match when he took eight Nottinghamshire wickets for 47 runs; this was the best bowling of his career. He almost equalled that return in the very next game by taking eight Surrey wickets for 49 in the first innings. Whitehead's success brought him selection for one of the representative sides in a non-Test cricket season: he played for A. J. Webbe's XI alongside notables such as Lord Hawke and F. S. Jackson against Cambridge University and took eight wickets in the game. He was, however, unable to sustain this level of performance, though he finished the 1894 season with 73 wickets at the respectable bowling average of 17.17 runs per wicket. Whitehead was still a front-line bowler for Warwickshire in the inaugural County Championship season for 1895, but was less effective than he had been, and his 42 wickets that season cost an average of 26.61. Thereafter, he played a few matches each season through to 1900, managing at least one decent return in each season, but never taking more than 20 wickets in any one season. Death In 1904, Whitehead was awarded a joint benefit match by Warwickshire with Walter Richards, another player whose county career straddled the transition to first-class status; the match selected was the three-day game against Essex, starting on Monday 6 June. Whitehead attended the match and, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, was \\"apparently in his usual health\\". A newspaper report later that week, however, states that at the end of the match on the Wednesday evening, \\"he complained of feeling unwell, but his colleagues thought he was suffering from the effects of excitement\\". The following day, the newspaper reported, a doctor was called and pronounced that Whitehead had \\"English cholera\\", now called dysentery; he died the same evening. Further explanation came from an inquest held the following week: Whitehead, the inquest heard, had drunk some \\"stale beer\\" while playing for Stratford Cricket Club on the Saturday preceding his benefit match and that, combined with consumption (tuberculosis), had produced \\"acute gastro enteritis\\" which was cited as the cause of death.

The first draft of NSAM-273, completed before Kennedy's death, was approved with minor changes by President Johnson. As the initial statement ‚Äì top secret at the time ‚Äì of U.S. policy in the Vietnam War of the Johnson presidency, NSAM-273 has been studied carefully to determine if it changed policies toward Vietnam from those of the Kennedy presidency.

The strategy outlined in NSAM-273 was quickly overtaken by events and more realistic appraisals of the situation in South Vietnam.

The advisers concurred with plans, as stated in National Security Action Memorandum 263 of October 11, 1963 to withdraw 1,000 U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam by the end of 1963, and most American soldiers by the end of 1965.Pentagon Papers, IV:B Evolution of the War, Counterinsurgency, The Kennedy Commitments, 1961‚Äì1963, 4.

There are no indications that Kennedy saw the draft before his assassination on November 22.Newman, John M. (1992), JFK and Vietnam: Deception, Intrigue, and the Struggle for Power, New York: Warner Books, p. 438-442 NSAM-273 NSAM-273 consists of 10 paragraphs of which 8 are identical with the Bundy draft of November 21. Paragraph 4 and 7 had been changed. Paragraph 4 is more emphatic than Bundy's draft. It exhorts \\"unity of support for established U.S. policy in South Vietnam\\" and places \\"particular importance\\" on avoiding criticism of other U.S. government officials and agencies. This was an attempt by Johnson to stifle policy disputes in Washington among his chief advisers and in Saigon between Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins. The changes in Paragraph 7 of Bundy's draft are related to prosecution of the war. Bundy had said that there should be a detailed plan by South Vietnam for taking action against North Vietnam. NSAM-273 as adopted is more specific, detailing the purposes of planning ‚Äì but not confining such planning to action by South Vietnam, implying that the U.S. would assist and participate in covert action in North Vietnam.NSAM 273 Presidential Guidance Stemming from Honolulu Conference re US Policy in South Vietnam\\" http://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsam-lbj/nsam-273.htm; \\"National Security Action Memorandum: NSAM 273\\", https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v04/d331, accessed Nov. 27, 2015 The strengthening of this paragraph seems to have been at the behest of the U.S. military which believed that many of South Vietnam's problems originated in North Vietnam and that action should be taken against the North.Kaiser, David (2000), American Tragedy: Kennedy, Johnson, and the Origins of the Vietnam War, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 282 The most discussed part of NSAM 273 is Paragraph 2 which affirmed the withdrawal called for in NSAM 263. stating \\"The objectives of the United States with respect to the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel remain as stated in the White House statement of October 2, 1963.\\" (The White House statement of 2 October, among other things, declared the intention to withdraw 1,000 soldiers from Vietnam by end of the 1963.)National Security Action Memorandums (NSAMs) http://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsam-lbj/nsam-273.htm, accessed Nov. 26, 2015 Paragraph 5 reflects that long-standing U.S. opinion that the military and pacification efforts of South Vietnam should be focused on the Mekong Delta where the situation is \\"critical.\\" Paragraph 6 says that aid to the new South Vietnamese government should be maintained at least at levels provided to the previous Diem government.

Phased Withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, 1962‚Äì1964, p. 30 Robert McNamara Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had made decisions on the Vietnam War based on optimistic reports from the American Embassy and MACV in Saigon and from frequent assessment missions by U.S. policy makers. (The dissenters included some lower-level employees in the Department of State, CIA, the U.S. military, and U.S. journalists in South Vietnam.)Asprey, Robert B. (1994) War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History, New York: William Morrow, pp. 757‚Äì761 The ink was barely dry on NSAM 273 when those optimistic assessments turned pessimistic. With dissention increasing among U.S. policy makers (Ambassador Lodge vs General Harkins in Saigon; Presidential advisor General Maxwell D. Taylor vs other military leaders in Washington) and reports of Viet Cong successes, Johnson sent Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Taylor back to Vietnam for another assessment. McNamara's report of December 20, 1963, was far more pessimistic that his previous assessments. He said, \\"The situation is very disturbing. Current trends, unless reversed in the next 2‚Äì3 months, will lead to neutralization at best and most likely to a Communist-controlled state.\\" McNamara also criticized the ineffectiveness of the new South Vietnamese government, formed after the assassination of President Diem.Kaiser, p. 292-293 The immediate response of the U.S. government to its sudden realization that the political and military situation in South Vietnam was not good was to expand the U.S.'s role in the Vietnam War. NSAM 273 had defined the \\"central object\\" of the U.S. \\"to assist the people and Government [of South Vietnam] to win their contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy.\\" Escalating the U.S. objectives, on January 22, 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent McNamara a memo declaring \\"victory\\" to be the U.S. objective and recommending that the U.S. \\"put aside many of the self-imposed restrictions which now limit our efforts and undertake bolder actions which may embody greater risks.\\" On 30 January another coup d'etat in Saigon emphasized to the U.S. policy makers the instability of the South Vietnamese government. Disarray in Saigon was accompanied by policy wars in Washington between the Departments of State and Defense and within the Department of Defense. A series of decisions on Mar. 8, 1965 to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam was the end result.McMaster, H. R.

He was born at Cape Town and died in the southern suburb of Mowbray. He was known, in English cricket at least, as \\"George Whitehead\\". Whitehead was a protege of Walter Richards, the old Warwickshire cricketer who coached in South Africa, and returned with Richards with a view to joining the Warwickshire staff when qualified through residence. He was described as \\"a left-handed medium-paced bowler [who] makes the ball get up very quickly from the pitch\\" and a left-handed \\"promising\\" batsman, and had played for the Cape Town Cricket Club. In the event, as he was not qualified for County Championship games, he played only one first-class match for Warwickshire, the match against London County in 1902, scored just one run in his only innings and failed to take a wicket. Whitehead returned to South Africa and from the 1904‚Äì05 season he played fairly regularly for Western Province as an opening bowler and lower-order batsman through to 1910‚Äì11, then for a couple of seasons with Griqualand West, returning to Western Province after the First World War. His bowling was often effective, and against Natal in 1908 he took seven second-innings wickets for 58 runs and 10 for 83 in the match, in which he bowled unchanged throughout. In a career of only 30 first-class matches, he took five or more wickets in an innings seven times.

The character is played by Michael B. Jordan, in the original movie as well as in the sequel Creed II (2018). In the fictional setting of the films, Donnie is the illegitimate son of the late and former world champion Apollo Creed, the result of an affair by the former heavyweight champion and a woman with the surname Johnson who died sometime in the 1990s. Donnie spends the first several years of his life in foster care and juvenile hall, until he is subsequently adopted by Mary Anne Creed, Apollo's widow. He lives a life of luxury and maintains a stable white collar job, only to abandon it to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a professional boxer. He goes to Philadelphia and convinces his late father's friend Rocky Balboa to train and mentor him. In film Creed In 1998, Adonis \\"Donnie\\" Johnson is spending time at a juvenile detention center in Los Angeles and frequently getting into fights with other children. As a result, he is sent to solitary confinement. Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), Apollo's widow, meets with Donnie and adopts him; informing him that he is Apollo Creed's son (sired from an extramarital affair). Seventeen years later, in 2015, Donnie (using his biological mother's last name Johnson) is a wealthy young college graduate working as a securities firm at the Smith Boardley Financial Group. However, on weekends, he sneaks out to Tijuana to fight professional boxing matches against unheralded opponents, and maintains an undefeated 15‚Äì0 record. Soon, Donnie resigns from his securities firm job to pursue his dream of becoming a boxer. Mary Anne vehemently opposes Donnie's plot of becoming a boxer, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring during a match against Ivan Drago thirty years ago and how Rocky Balboa was forced into retirement after suffering brain damage. Donnie finds it hard to get anyone in Los Angeles to train him due to his father's death in the ring, particularly after he suffers an embarrassing loss in a sparring match to light heavyweight contender Danny \\"Stuntman\\" Wheeler (Andre Ward). Undaunted, Donnie moves out of his mother's residence and travels to Philadelphia in hopes of seeking out his father's best friend and former rival, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone). Once in Philadelphia, Donnie meets Rocky at Adrian's Restaurant and tries to convince him to be his trainer. Having given up boxing, and believing Apollo wouldn't want his son to be a fighter, Rocky rejects his offer. However, Donnie's persistence eventually wins Rocky over. He forms a strong bond with Rocky and regards him as an uncle, even going so far as to call him \\"Unc\\" and introduce him to people as such. Meanwhile, Donnie forms a relationship with his downstairs neighbor, Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson), a singer-songwriter with progressive hearing loss. Donnie gets a match with Leo \\"The Lion\\" Sporino (Gabriel Rosado), the son of a trainer, who originally wanted Rocky to coach his son. He moves in with Rocky to train for the upcoming match. Rocky takes Donnie‚Äînow known as \\"Hollywood\\"‚Äîto the Front Street Gym to prepare with the help of several of Rocky's longtime friends, where Donnie markedly improves his hand speed, stamina, and defense. Prior to the fight, Sporino's father learns that Donnie is in fact Apollo Creed's son. After Donnie wins the fight in a 2nd- round KO, Sporino's father alerts the media of Donnie' parentage. Meanwhile, World light heavyweight champion \\"Pretty\\" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) is being forced into retirement due to an upcoming prison sentence and is gearing up for his final fight against Danny \\"Stuntman\\" Wheeler. After Conlan breaks Wheeler's jaw at the weigh-in for their title fight, Conlan's manager, Tommy Holiday (Graham McTavish), decides that the best way to end his career would be against the son of Apollo Creed. Conlan is against it, but reluctantly agrees. Holiday meets with Rocky and Donnie, demanding that he should use the name Creed if he wants a shot at the light heavyweight title. Donnie is reluctant due to his desire to forge his own legacy. He only consents after Bianca persuades him to use Apollo's surname. During one intense night of training, Rocky becomes ill and is taken to the hospital. He is diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but refuses to undergo chemotherapy, remembering that it wasn't enough to save his wife, Adrian. Donnie discovers pamphlets about the disease in Rocky's coat pocket after another late night training session, where Rocky tells Donnie that they are not family, and that he has nothing to live for now that Adrian, his best friend and brother-in-law Paulie, Apollo and his old coach Mickey, have died, and his son, Robert Jr., has moved away to Vancouver. Later on, a frustrated Donnie is about to attend a concert, where Bianca is about to perform. However, after a stranger insults him and his father, Donnie becomes irate, and attacks the stranger in a fit of rage, prompting security to restrain him. Donnie is then arrested for assault and sent to jail. When Rocky comes to bail him out, Donnie is still upset, and tells off the former heavyweight champion, accusing him of getting Apollo killed in the ring. Later, Donnie goes to Bianca's apartment to apologize and explain the situation. However, Bianca deems it best for she and Donnie to focus on their individual careers. She then closes the door and removes her hearing aids as Donnie continues to plead for forgiveness on the other side of the door. Donnie then meets up with Rocky, explaining that he is going to use the name Creed and fight against Conlan, but only if Rocky gets treatment for his illness. While Rocky is still sick, he still trains Donnie in the hospital room and back in his house. The match takes place in Conlan's hometown of Liverpool, England, where Donnie is antagonized by Conlan who refers to him as a ‚Äúfalse Creed‚Äù at the press conference. Before the match, Bianca comes to their hotel at Rocky's behest, and the two reconcile. Mary Anne sends Donnie his father's iconic American flag boxing shorts; the back of the shorts bearing the name Johnson and the front bearing the name Creed. After some early struggles, Donnie shocks the world by giving Conlan all he can handle. He ultimately goes the distance, even managing to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career as Bianca and the once-antagonistic crowd begin to cheer him on. Although he loses by split decision, Donnie gains the respect and admiration of Conlan and everyone watching. Back in Philadelphia, Donnie and a frail but rather improving Rocky go up the Rocky Steps, representing a victory for both Rocky and Donnie in fighting their respective battles. Creed II Three years later, Donnie goes on to win six fights, all by knockout. At the beginning of Creed II, Donnie defeats Wheeler for the WBC World Heavyweight Championship by KO in the 4th round. Now that he's the champion, he proposes marriage to Bianca who accepts. When they are getting dinner one night in Philadelphia, they see that Ivan Drago's son Viktor has publicly challenged Donnie to a fight. Donnie talks with Rocky, who doesn't want Donnie to take the fight because of what happened thirty-three years earlier. Donnie gives Rocky an ultimatum that he will take the fight with or without Rocky, who declines. Donnie and Bianca settle in Los Angeles to be closer with Mary Anne, where Bianca learns that she's pregnant. Donnie recruits Tony \\"Little Duke\\" Evers, the son of his father's trainer, to train him. Donnie, overwhelmed, rushes into the fight and gets seriously injured, but wins when Viktor is disqualified for punching Donnie when he is down. Donnie, with broken ribs, a ruptured kidney, and a concussion, becomes increasingly distant from Bianca and Mary Anne. Mary Anne eventually reaches out to Rocky, who comes out west to pay a visit with Donnie. Bianca goes into labor and gives birth to a healthy baby girl, Amara. However, Donnie and Bianca's fears are realized when the child is born deaf. With Amara now in his life, Donnie comes to terms with the fact that he needs to be more open with the people closest to him. He also comes to terms that he has to fight Viktor again, and win. He promises to be there for his family, but asks them to be there for him. Rocky and Little Duke take Donnie to the desert to rigorously train his body from within to prepare for the fight, while Mary Anne, Bianca, and Amara provide a stable support system. In the second match, Donnie is more accustomed to Viktor by fighting more comfortably in close range. Viktor has never had to fight past the 4th round, and while Viktor is winning on points, Donnie uses his stamina to his advantage later in the fight, despite having his ribs broken again. After a knockdown in the 10th round, Donnie unleashes a furious rage on Viktor, knocking him down twice and prompting Ivan Drago to throw in the towel to protect his son. Donnie, having retained the title, visits Apollo's grave with Bianca and Amara, where he makes peace with his dad for carrying on his legacy while also building his own. Casting and creation Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler had previously worked on Fruitvale Station together in 2013. Coogler contacted Jordan and presented him with the role of Apollo Creed's son. Jordan didn't use a body double in his scenes. Of his experience, Jordan stated, \\"I didn't get knocked out or anything like that, but yeah there were definitely some slips, some jabs, some body punches.\\" Jordan had a strict diet in preparation for the role:\\"I stripped down my diet completely. Grilled chicken, brown rice, broccoli and a lot of water. I worked out two to three times a day, six days a week. And ... if you do that consistently for about 10 months your body will change.\\" Ryan Coogler stated that \\"That was [Jordan] taking real punches\\" and became \\"routinely bloodied, bruised and dizzy\\" from his fight scenes with Andre Ward, Gabriel Rosado, and Tony Bellew, all of whom are professional boxers. Gabriel Rosado stated of Jordan's boxing skills, \\"Michael can throw down man. If you sleep on him in the street he might put you to sleep.\\" Ryan Coogler was inspired to make Creed from his experiences with his own father: \\"He used to play Rocky before I had football games to pump me up, and he would get really emotional watching the movies. He used to watch Rocky II with his mom while she was sick and dying of cancer. She died when he was 18 years old. And so when he got sick he was losing his strength because he had a muscular condition. He was having trouble getting around, having trouble carrying stuff. I started thinking about this idea of my dad‚Äôs mortality. For me he was kind of like this mythical figure, my father, similar to what Rocky was for him. Going through it inspired me to make a film that told a story about his hero going through something similar to kind of motivate him and cheer him up. That‚Äôs how I came up with the idea for this movie.\\" Although Sylvester Stallone was initially reluctant to help out with the film, he changed his mind upon meeting with Coogler and Jordan. In discussing Stallone's advice to him, Jordan said that he \\"taught me how to throw punches and hit me in my chest a couple times.\\". Personality Donnie is torn between trying to preserve his father's legacy and build his own. A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that, \\"Donnie is a complex character with a complex fate. He is at once a rich kid and a street kid, the proud carrier of an illustrious heritage and an invisible man. His relationship with Rocky is complicated, too. The older fighter is a mentor and a father figure, to be sure, but he also needs someone to take care of him, especially when illness adds a melodramatic twist to the plot. Donnie has been described as \\"arrogant\\",. Although Donnie' circumstances change after he is adopted by Mary Anne Creed, his late father's widow, he retains his fiery personality. Short-tempered and impulsive, but good-natured, it is Donnie' tenacity that convinces Rocky to train him. Michael O' Sullivan of The Washington Post analyzed that Donnie' \\"struggles with his temper\\" are \\"a coping mechanism that helps him deal with the fear of not living up to the name Creed.\\" Jordan states of Donnie, \\"My character is living in the shadow of his dad, who is arguably the greatest fighter that ever lived, and he really has to embrace that to move forward. I could understand wanting to have your own legacy and trying to find your own lane\\". Donnie' hubris initially causes him to refuse to embrace the name Creed, instead using his mother's surname, Johnson. Only with his girlfriend Bianca's encouragement does Donnie eventually come to accept the name. When Donnie meets Rocky and reveals to him that he is Apollo's son and that he wants the elder former boxer to train him, Rocky questions, \\"Why would you pick a fighter's life when you don't need to?\\" He immediately notes that Donnie is well-educated and comes from a wealthy background, which contrasts Rocky's own upbringing. However, Rocky sees in Donnie the drive and determination in himself and Apollo when he was younger, and concedes in training him. After Rocky is diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphona, it is Donnie who motivates him and teaches him to fight again: \\"Donnie is there to push [Rocky] the same way Rocky pushes him in the gym and in the ring.\\" Donnie pays tribute to Rocky, his father, and his country by wearing the classic American flag shorts in his debut professional match that Apollo and Balboa sported in their bouts against Ivan Drago. However, Donnie' shorts have the name Johnson on the back and Creed on the front, symbolizing that he can both preserve his father's legacy and still make his own. Reception The character of Donnie and Jordan's portrayal of the character have received critical acclaim. Aisha Harris of Slate stated, \\"I feared signing on to Creed might derail Coogler‚Äôs and Jordan‚Äôs careers. Instead, this revitalizing crowd-pleaser solidifies my belief that these two have the potential to create really great art.\\" \\"In a performance that should help his fans forget Fantastic Four, Jordan is flat- out terrific\\", said reviewer Calvin Wilson. A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that \\"Mr. Jordan‚Äôs limitations...have yet to be discovered. With every role, he seems to delight in the unfolding of his talent, and to pass his excitement along to the audience.\\" David Sims of The Atlantic said, \\"Coogler and Jordan...create a protagonist of color who avoids the stereotypes of many of Hollywood‚Äôs black heroes while still being celebrated as one. Donnie is an easy hero for everyone to cheer for, but he‚Äôs not thinly painted. Scenes where he runs through Philadelphia followed by cheering kids on bikes are especially memorable‚Äîthey celebrate the film‚Äôs myth-making without putting the hero on an unreachable pedestal.\\" Reviewers praised Donnie's relationship with Bianca; Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated that, \\"the romance Donnie has with his own Adrian, R&B; singer Bianca (a terrific Tessa Thompson), feels sexually frisky and freshly conceived.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time says, \\"Jordan‚Äôs face, in particular, is the kind you feel protective of. He‚Äôs charismatic in a totally carefree way‚Äîyou never catch him trying too hard, and his scenes with Thompson have a lovely, bantering lyricism.\\" References Black characters in films Fictional African-American people Fictional boxers Film characters introduced in 2015 Fictional characters from Los Angeles Fictional male sportspeople Rocky characters ","title":"Adonis Creed"},{"id":"48668185","text":"The 1989‚Äì90 Eintracht Frankfurt season was the 90th season in the club's football history.

[Monastic Living and American Specialties] have a very similar relationship in that they are very different sounding than anything else the band has done.

The Hialeah Public Library has one central library, John F. Kennedy Library, and five neighborhood e-libraries.  History  In 1924, the Hialeah Woman's Club set their first goal as an organization to open a local library for soon to be incorporated City of Hialeah, and with the backing of Ms. Lua Adams Curtiss, they reached out to the community for donated books. After a book tea, hosted by the Woman's Club in 1924, fifty books were acquired, and the Woman's Club was able to open Hialeah's first \\"library\\"; a single room in Ms. J Sommers Garwood's home. Garwood was the President of the Woman's Club during that time. The next year, the Woman's Club received a large donation from a benefactor after her death, and needed to find a larger location for the library. The Hialeah School Board decided to help by donating the use of a portable classroom at South Hialeah Elementary. The library was housed in this location until the hurricane of 1926 severely damaged the building and some of the collection. After the Hurricane of 1926, the library moved to a room within city hall. The Hialeah Woman's Club was also able to reach out to the community and request more donations to make up for the lost titles. The library was housed in this temporary location for about 20 years. During that time, it was staffed by volunteers and acquired titles only through donation. In the early 1950s, the library moved to its first permanent location, the two-story water tower adjoining the City of Hialeah's fire station. When the library moved to this location, the City of Hialeah began to pay for the utilities, and hired the first part-time librarian. In 1958, the City of Hialeah had increased to a population of 40,000 and in order to meet the needs of the community, the library moved into a newer and larger location, The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library. At this time, the library hired its first full-time librarian. The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library was named after one of the first members of the Hialeah Woman's Club who championed the creation of Hialeah's local library. It is a single story, one room building that, at its opening, housed 14,000 items to be borrowed. In 1965, the Hialeah Public Library grew to include the John F. Kennedy Library, which is currently the main branch of the system. Starting in 2001, Hialeah added five e-library locations throughout the city. These sites serve heavily populated, underprivileged areas that may not have internet access at home or may not have the transportation available to visit a more distant library branch. The e-libraries share space with a police substation or a community center and are staffed by library paraprofessionals. The e-library locations provide computers for internet access. Customers may request items for interlibrary loan, pick up reserved items or return material. There is a revolving book collection at each e-library, and programs such as children's story time are offered.  Branches  * John F. Kennedy Library, established 1965.

It is a station of the ZM network, and is owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. History Early Years The ZM station in Wellington has a history dating back to 1937 as local station 2YD which originally broadcast on 1130AM. The station was started by the New Zealand government owned Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Board). In 1969 the call sign was changed to 2ZM and in 1973 2ZM was joined with 1YD and 3ZM in Christchurch to form to youth orientated ZM network, 1YD then became 1ZM. The first 2ZM breakfast DJ (6 am to 9 am) was Stewart Macpherson, who had just returned from broadcasting in the UK with both the BBC and Radio Luxembourg. Using the show title 'Macphersonland', his innovations included introducing News Bulletins onto the station (despite management opposition), and a weekly published Top 40 chart available at leading music stores. In 1978 2ZM moved to 1161 kHz after the AM band spacing in New Zealand was adjusted from 10 kHz to 9 kHz. FM Broadcasting Wellington's 2ZM was the first ZM station to broadcast on FM from 21 December 1985 as ZMFM 91 (90.9). As the Mount Kaukau transmitter couldn't cover parts of the Hutt Valley effectively, the station continued to broadcast on AM until 1986, when a second transmitter at Towai (on the Wainuiomata Hill between Seaview and Wainuiomata) was commissioned broadcasting on 93.5 to cover the Hutt Valley. Its AM frequency (1161 kHz) was reallocated to Maori station Te Upoko o Te Ika. During the late eighties ZMFM relocated its studio from Broadcasting House to Alder House (on the corner of Vivian and Victoria streets in Wellington). Slogans used by ZMFM included Hit Radio, ZMFM The Music Leader, Rock of the Nineties ZMFM. In 1994 ZMFM Wellington became known as 91ZM sharing the same name that had been used in Christchurch since 1989, and the studios were relocated their current location on the corner of Taranaki and Abel Smith streets in Wellington. Privatisation In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. 90.6ZM Manawatu Station ZM originally commenced transmission to Manawatu on 9 March 1987 on 90.6 MHz. The program was a relay of the Wellington ZMFM station with local commercial breaks and station identification. ZMFM Manawatu also ran its own breakfast show ‚Äì \\"Jackson and The Morning Crew\\" featuring Pete Jackson. In 1989, 90.6 ZMFM re- branded as 2 Double Q, subsequently dropping the relay of ZMFM Wellington and beginning a seven-year absence of the ZM name in Manawatu. The ZM brand did not return to the Manawatu market until 1997 when Classic Rock Q91FM (formerly 2 Double Q) reverted to ZM (as 91ZM). The new ZM programme created in 1997 used a computerised automation system to provide a local programme recorded minutes before from the Wellington studio. 96ZM in Dunedin and Invercargill used a similar system to receive their programming from 91ZM Christchurch. In 2000 ZM switched to a single network feed with all networked ZM stations now receiving their programming from Auckland, as a result 91ZM Manawatu now contained the same programming as 91ZM Auckland instead of Wellington. 91.1ZM Kapiti Station ZM began broadcasting on its own frequency in the Kapiti region in 2004 with localised advertisement breaks for the Kapiti region. While ZM in Wellington did contain some local programming at this point the Kapiti station took all network programming from Auckland despite the 'Top of the Hour Station id' mentioning the Wellington 90.9FM frequency. In March 2007, ZM altered its Hutt Valley frequency from 93.5 to 90.9, to form a synchronous transmission with the signal from Mt Kaukau, also on 90.9. This meant that commuters no longer had to switch their radio dials between the two frequencies when driving between Wellington and the Hutt Valley. In June 2008, Easy Mix was networked on ZM's old 93.5 frequency. In March 2012 ZM in Wellington celebrated 40 years on the air since the station was first. Despite 1973 being the year ZM was started in Auckland and Christchurch, ZM was started in 1972 in Wellington as 2ZM making 2012 40 years. Past and Present Local Announcers During the 1980s announcers Pauline Gillespie, Grant Kereama and Nick Tansley all joined ZMFM Wellington, all three announcers were teamed up in the late eighties to present the breakfast show. This show was very successful and has been a number 1 rating show in Wellington since the nineties. In 2001 the Wellington breakfast show became the new nationwide breakfast, originally Wellington ran their own local news breaks on the half- hour while the rest of the country used the Auckland-based ZM Newsbeat Service. For the first year the ZM Morning Crew show ran from 6am to 10am in Wellington but finished an hour earlier in the rest of New Zealand this was so Polly, Nick and Grant could present the final hour of their show to a Wellington only audience. Outside breakfast programming remained local but between 2003 and 2009 local content was reduced to a point where from 2009 the breakfast show was the only show to come out of Wellington. Wellington did run their own local news service until 2006 when this was replaced with the networked Newsbeat. In April 2014 Polly and Grant moved to The Hits (formally known as Classic Hits) and ZM launched their new breakfast show produced by Fletch, Vaughan and Megan. Today Polly and Grant present their nationwide breakfast show on The Hits from Wellington and the ZM Wellington studios are no longer used. *Breakfast 6am10am: **19691972: Stewart Macpherson (show ran 6am9am) **19821984: JR (James Ring) & Anne Marie (St Ledger-Higgens) **19851987: Mark MacLeod, Sue Bergin **late 1980s2003: Nick Tansley - Breakfast co-host on Polly and Grants show **late 1980s2014: Pauline Gillespie (Polly), and Grant Kereama **20042014: Mark Peard (show producer) **2014 onwards: Networked from Auckland *Daytime 10am3pm: ** 19961999: Justin Rae ** 19992003: Aroha Hathaway ** 20032008: Simon O'neil ** 2008 onwards: Networked from Auckland *Drive 3pm7pm: ** 19921996: Sandy Antipas ** 19982003: Julian Burn ** 2003 onwards: Networked from Auckland *Nights 7pmmidnight: ** 19961998: Dallas Gurney ** 1998 onwards: Networked from Auckland References Wellington, ZM Radio stations in Wellington ","title":"ZM Wellington"},{"id":"48668290","text":"Turatia foeldvarii is a moth in the family Autostichidae.

It is a station of the ZM network, and is owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. History Early years The ZM station in Christchurch has a history dating back to 1963 as local station 3ZM which originally broadcast on 1400AM. The station was started by the New Zealand government owned Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation). In 1973 3ZM was joined with 1YD Auckland and 2ZM in Wellington to form to youth orientated ZM network, 1YD became 1ZM. In 1978, in a bid to compete against local Christchurch station Radio Avon 3ZM was rebranded as Radio Nova (coincidentally 'Avon' spelt backwards) playing an Easy Listening format similar to that of Radio i in Auckland. Listener interest was strong at first but later ratings dropped and the station was reverted to 3ZM playing the same music format as that of 1ZM and 2ZM.New Zealand Radio Dial 1978 Commentary 3ZM later moved to 1323 kHz in 1978 after the AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing. FM broadcasting 3ZM switched to FM in 1986 and was relaunched as ZMFM using similar branding to ZMFM Wellington which had switched to FM in 1985. Originally when ZM in Christchurch was switching to FM they believed they would be broadcasting on 92.9 MHz and printed stickers with this frequency on it. Test transmissions took place on this frequency but when the station finally launched on FM the frequency 91.3 MHz was used instead with 92.9 MHz being allocated to C93FM. Following the switch to FM, ZMFM ceased broadcasting on AM several months later. The 1323 kHz frequency was used for Maori broadcasting by Aotearoa Radio in the early 1990s, then by Radio Liberty in the mid-1990s. It is no longer in use by any station in the region. Since the main Sugarloaf transmitter in the Port Hills couldn't serve the Sumner area, a second transmitter and frequency for 91ZM Christchurch was established there on 89.2 MHz; in 2009 this was adjusted to 90.9 MHz. Today the station is referred to as Canterbury's 91-3ZM. In 1989 ZMFM Christchurch was rebranded as 91 Stereo ZM and later 91ZM. ZMFM Wellington retained its branding as ZMFM. In 1994 ZMFM Wellington was rebranded as 91ZM with both stations now using the same slogan 91ZM. Nationally most listeners knew the ZM brand as 91ZM during the 1990s. Dunedin and Invercargill 96ZM stations 96ZM Dunedin was the very first networked ZM station, the station began broadcasting on 95.8 MHz in June 1996. An automated computer system allowed an announcer in the 91ZM Christchurch studio to produce two separate voice breaks, one for listeners on 91ZM Christchurch and a second voice break for listeners on 96ZM Dunedin. In June 1997 96ZM Invercargill was launched with its programming also originating from 91ZM Christchurch. The announcer now produced 3 separate voice breaks, programming between the 3 stations was not in-sync with each other due to varied lengths of voice breaks and advertising, often the final song heard each hour was cut short as the 3 stations synced together at the top of the hour. With the high amount of talk on the breakfast show breakfast was kept to a single show mostly tailored to the Christchurch audience, at this time the announcers would call the station ZM. 91ZM Manawatu used a similar system to receive its programming from 91ZM Wellington. In 2000 ZM switched to a single network feed with all networked ZM stations now receiving their programming from Auckland, as a result 96ZM Dunedin and Invercargill now contained the same programming as 91ZM Auckland instead of Christchurch. Closure of 91ZM Christchurch studio In 2000 ZM created a nationwide network with all networked ZM stations receiving their content from Auckland, Christchurch remained a local station for the following year using the tagline \\"Today's Hit Music for Christchurch\\". In 2001 more changes were made to ZM which resulted in the closure of the Christchurch studio. The drive show announcer Jason Royal and his producer Jason Wistanley were moved to Auckland to present a nationwide drive show on the ZM network. Local programming was reintroduced in 2005 but was limited to a local daytime show between 10 am and 3 pm and the show was dropped again in 2009. With the advent of network programming, from 2001 the station was known simply as ZM and localized station id's used the name 91-3ZM. Past announcers James Daniels and Ken Ellis were the breakfast hosts for much of the late eighties and until 1992. James and Ken's replacement were Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford (Si and Phil). Si and Phil grew the breakfast audience - ultimately becoming Christchurch's number one rating breakfast show. Si and Phil eventually departed to 92 More FM in 1997. Their replacement was Rik Van Dijk, Katrina Smith and Chuckie Shearer. Unfortunately this show did not rate well enough for the management at ZM to justify keeping on the air when in 2001 a decision was made to close down the Christchurch studios and replace all local programming with networked shows. *Breakfast 6 am‚Äì10 am: **1984‚Äì1992: Ken Ellis and James Daniels **1992‚Äì1992: Mark Kennedy and Danny Watson (MAD in the Morning) **1992‚Äì1997: Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford **1997‚Äì1998: Rick Van Dijk, Katrina Smith and Chuckie Shearer **1998‚Äì2001: Rick Van Dijk and Katrina Smith **2001 onwards: Networked from Auckland/Wellington *Daytime 10 am‚Äì2 pm: **1990s‚Äì1998: Val Robinson **1998‚Äì2001: Breffni O'Rourke **2001‚Äì2005: Networked from Auckland **2005‚Äì2009: Bridget Howard (10 am‚Äì3 pm) **2009 onwards: Networked from Auckland *Drive 2 pm‚Äì7 pm: **1993‚Äì1997: Mark Fahey **1997‚Äì1998: Jason Royal **1998: Dallas Gurney **1999‚Äì2000: Jason Royal **2001 onwards: Networked from Auckland *Nights: ** 1990s: Christian Boston **1990s‚Äì1998: Willy Macalister **1998 onwards: Networked from Auckland Studio location Prior the sale of Radio New Zealand's Commercial stations to The Radio Network in 1996, 91ZM, Newstalk ZB and Classic Hits (along with Radio New Zealand and the NZ Sound Archives) were located at Kent House on the corner of Chester Street West and Durham Street North (51 Chester Street West). The original 3ZM studios were located at 205 Gloucester Street, the building was also used for other Radio New Zealand stations such as National Radio and 3ZB. Following the arrival of television in New Zealand the National Broadcasting Service converted their existing radio studio buildings for television, the building was used as studios for CHTV3 which eventually became TVNZ 1. In the 1980s TVNZ and Radio New Zealand used a building on Worcester Street located behind the Gloucester Street building to produce many of their TV and radio shows. From the 1990s onwards The Radio Network Christchurch stations were housed in the Worcester Street building. While ZM Christchurch has not produced any local shows since 2009 this building was used for Newstalk ZB Christchurch and Classic Hits 97.7 Christchurch up until the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011. The Radio Network Christchurch never returned to their Worcester Street premises and eventually set up in a new location. The Worcester Street building was taken down in August 2012, in New Zealand's first ever controlled building demolition with explosives.

His Mukhtarnameh poem is one of the longest and earliest epics in Albanian literature. Life and work Shahin (Shahinin) Kaso Frash√´ri was born in Frash√´r, today's P√´rmet District, back then part of the Janina Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He was the younger brother of the other poet Dalip Frash√´ri, and uncle of the Albanian poets and National Awakening activists Naim, Sami, and Abdyl Frash√´ri.World Bektashi Headquarters Teqeja e Frash√´rit - Vat√´r e zjarrt√´ (in Albanian) Not much is known on his life. He left his name in the Albanian literature with his poem Mukhtarnameh (Book of Mukhtar), , an epic poem of around 12,000 verses. It describes the events post Battle of Karbala of 680 AD where Husayn ibn Ali got killed, an important event in the chronology of Islam. Frash√´ri describes the rebellion of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi of 66 AH (corresponding to 685-6 AD), and the Alid movement in vengeance for the death of Husayn ibn Ali. Frash√´ri finished his work in 1868. He used a Turkish version as base or intermediary model, though the original is in Persian. It is one of the latest major Bektashi-Shia work written in Albanian using the Arabic script. By that time, the National Awakening had started and Bektashis of Albania switched to the new Albanian scripts. According to the Jordanian professor Muhammad Mufaku al-Arna'ut, who has studied in detail the early Arabic script based Albanian poetry, the Mukhtarnameh together with the Garden of the martyrs (Alb: Kopshti i te mirevet) of Frash√´ri's brother Dalip, established a subgenre of its own within the Albanian poetry. They served as base model for the later work of the Albanian nationalist poet Naim Frash√´ri named Qerbelaja (Karbala), and also for the epic Istori' e Skenderbeut (History of Scanderbeg), published in Bucharest in 1898. Very short excerpts of Muktarnameh have been published so far.

The locomotive is a Tasmanian Government Railways M Class from 1952. The carriages consist of Articulated Country Saloon (ACS) carriage #1, an SS class suburban carriage, and a TGR DP Class railmotor.

Contrary to some tourist information, the steam engine never hauled the Tasman Limited service, but ACS carriage #1 was purpose-built for this task which operated until 1978.

It was led by Prime Minister Chris Watson of the Australian Labor Party from 27 April 1904 to 18 August 1904. The Watson Government was the first Labor Party national government in both Australia and in the world.Australia's Prime Ministers ‚Äì Watson ‚Äì In Office; primeministers.naa.gov.au Watson was aged just 37 when he became Prime Minister of Australia, and remains the youngest person to have held the post. Background The Australian Federal Parliament had come into being with the Federation of Britain's Australian colonies in 1901. Edmund Barton's Protectionists held power in coalition with Labour, until Barton was succeeded by Alfred Deakin. The short-lived first Deakin Government failed to pass any legislation in the fledgling Australian Federal Parliament, and its shaky coalition with the Labour Party did not long survive the December 1903 Election. By the resumption of Parliament in March 1904, the Deakin Government had fallen, amid a dispute over a Labour Party amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.Australia's Prime Ministers ‚Äì Deakin ‚Äì In Office; primeministers.naa.gov.au Under Watson, Labour had adopted a policy of support for the Barton and Deakin Governments in return for concessions. However, the response of the conservative Victorian Government to a railway strike led Federal Labour to stridently pursue inclusion of state public servants within the ambit of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which Deakin was reluctant to accept. Labour made gains at the 1903 Election, and when Deakin sought to reintroduce his Bill following the election, the Labour amendment was again carried, leading Deakin to resign.McMullin, p.58 Chris Watson John Christian (Chris) Watson (1867‚Äì1941) was a trade unionist, company director, and politician who led Australia's‚Äîand the world's‚Äîfirst Labor national government.Nairn, Bede; Watson, John Christian (Chris) (1867‚Äì1941); Australian Dictionary of Biography Watson left school aged ten, worked as an assistant railway construction worker, farm hand, stable hand and compositor before becoming heavily involved in trade union politics. He was elected to the Trades and Labour Council in 1890, and the following year became involved with the newly formed Labor Party, entering the NSW Parliament as a Labour MP in 1894.McMullin, p.56 He was active in arguing the Labour case for Federation, and joined Labor's opposition to the Australian Constitution put to referendum in the 1890s, though accepted the majority vote once obtained. Watson entered the new Federal Parliament as Member for Bland, and at the first meeting of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in May 1901, he was elected leader. Through the first decade of Federation, Labour, the Protectionists and Free Traders were unable to secure majorities and were forced to govern in coalitions. Watson was aged just 37 when he became Prime Minister of Australia, and remains the youngest person to hold the post. McMullin wrote of Watson that \\"in that era of intractable parliamentary unwieldiness, his party had to pursue its objectives in concert with non-Labor MPs, and Watson's amiable personality was an important factor in Labor's capacity to negotiate desirable outcomes.\\" Ministry 1901 election, including Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, Billy Hughes, and Frank Tudor. The Watson Ministry was the third Australian Commonwealth ministry, and ran from 27 April 1904 to 17 August 1904. It was the first federal ministry formed by the Australian Labor Party. Watson became Treasurer, and gave External Affairs to Billy Hughes. Home Affairs went to Egerton Batchelor, and Trade and Customs to Andrew Fisher. Anderson Dawson became Minister for Defence and Hugh Mahon was appointed Postmaster-General. The portfolio of Attorney General went to H. B. Higgins, who was not a Labour member. Term of office Watson commanded a majority in neither the House of Representatives, nor the Senate. Many Australian conservatives greeted the arrival of a Labour Government with fear. Deakin promised \\"the utmost fair play\\" to allow the new government to operate, but his Protectionist Party was too divided to agree to serve in a Labour led alliance. Watson soon admitted to \\"despair\\", and when his government lost a vote on an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill regarding unionists, Watson resigned.McMullin, p.59 Amid the volatile environment of early Federation Australian politics, the Watson Government passed just six bills. Other than an amended Acts Interpretation Act 1904, these were all money bills, however, Watson advanced the landmark Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, passed later in 1904 by the Reid Government. Aftermath George Reid of the Free Trade Party was sworn in as Prime Minister on 18 August, and Watson returned to negotiations with the liberal wing of the Protectionists. Reid governed in shaky coalition with the Protectionists, and his government lasted until July 1905. Reid denounced Labour as the \\"Socialist tiger\\". Watson encouraged Deakin to abandon the Free Traders, saying: \\"We, and especially me, don't want office, but I have the utmost anxiety to stop the retrogressive movement which Reid is heading.\\" Deakin commenced his second term as Prime Minister in July 1905, with Labour's support.McMullin, p.59‚Äì60 Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines ‚Äì prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionists in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.Fusion: The Party System We Had To Have? ‚Äì by Charles Richardson CIS 25 January 2009 See also *History of Australia *History of Australia (1901‚Äì45) References *McMullin, Ross; Australian Prime Ministers Revised and Updated Edition; Edited by Michelle Grattan; New Holland; 2013 Watson 1904 in Australia Democratic socialism Labour parties ","title":"Watson Government"},{"id":"48668611","text":"Augustine Joseph Schulte (1856‚Äì1937) was an American Catholic priest who served as the interim rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome from 1884 to 1885. Early life Augustine Joseph Schulte was born on May 5, 1856 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Augustine and Louise Bille Schulte. He was educated at the parochial school of St. Peter Church in Philadelphia from 1863 until 1869 before entering St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook. He studied there from 1874 to 1879. Education and service in Rome He entered the North American College in Rome as a student on August 23, 1879. He completed the course of study and was ordained a priest by Raffaele Cardinal Monaco La Valletta on June 3, 1882 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. He served as assistant to the American College's rector, Louis Hostlot, starting on June 1, 1883. When Hostlot died at the age of 35 on February 1, 1884, Schulte was still serving in the role as his assistant. The College's executive committee of bishops met in New York on March 12, 1884 at the residence of Cardinal McCloskey to consider names for the vacant rectorship; at that time, three names were put forward, including that of Denis J. O'Connell, who would later be selected for the position. Yet, because Father Schulte's service \\"gave such great satisfaction to his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome,\\" Cardinal Simeoni, the College's Cardinal Protector, did not accept any of the candidates at that time. Instead, he suggested that Schulte continue to serve as the administrator of the College on a trial basis. Although the committee was a bit surprised at the suggestion, they agreed and the Cardinal was notified of the decision on May 9, 1884. Schulte was not the most likely candidate for rector, as he was only 28 years old at the time, and of a \\"fair complexion and slight, wiry build which made him look even younger.\\" Even so, Schulte served as a provisionary rector from 1884 to 1885. In the parlance of the seminary system of the time, he was styled pro- rector. While Schulte himself reckoned that his duties began on February 1, 1884 and precisely a year later in 1885, the technical term of service for which he was commissioned by the executive committee was from May 30, 1884 until June 15, 1885. College historian Robert McNamara notes that Schulte seems to have had little problem in commanding the respect of the students, despite his youth and lack of experience. He was quickly shouldered with responsibilities, of which a notable one was the College's silver jubilee in December 1884. To commemorate the occasion, Schulte was able to successfully arrange that the seminarians attend Pope Leo XIII's own private Mass in the Vatican and be received in a special audience afterwards. Frederick Frelinghuysen, saved the College from confiscation during Schulte's pro- rectorate and led to its canonical establishment in 1884 Much more significant, however, was the Kingdom of Italy's attempted confiscation of the American College's property in 1884. The Italian Supreme Court of Cassation ruled on January 29, 1884 that all of the Propaganda Fide's properties were to be confiscated and subject to conversion. The protest from the American Catholic hierarchy and laity was immediate and denunciations of the Italian government continued throughout the winter and spring of 1884. Indeed, the fear seemed to be well founded, as on February 27, Father Schulte learned that the sale of Propaganda real estate was about to begin, and the American College was first on the list. Schulte informed Cardinal Simeoni, who immediately cabled New York for assistance, while Schulte hung up an American flag over the College's doors in defiance. The Archbishop of New York, Michael Corrigan, quickly sprung into action at the news. He was able to show the cablegram to his friend George Bliss, a prominent New York lawyer. A string of contacts over the following day succeeded in placing the matter before the President of the United States, Chester A. Arthur. That led to Secretary of State Frederick Frelinghuysen requesting that the Italian government halt proceedings against the College. Although the College did not, in fact, hold title to the structure, a loophole in the 1873 legislation that permitted the seizure‚Äîplus the pressure of the United States government‚Äîallowed the College to escape confiscation. With the College saved, Schulte was \\"justly proud of having been the first to raise the hue and cry.\\" The incident, however, led the College's board of governors to request that the College be incorporated as an institution foundationally distinct from the Propaganda's Urban College, of which until that point it had functioned as a sort of subsidiary. Pope Leo XIII replied with the Apostolic Brief Ubi primum of October 25, 1884, which decreed the canonical institution of the North American College and gave it the rank and title of a \\"pontifical\\" college. In the end, the new canonical status of the College focused the attention of Cardinal Simeoni and the board of governors on finding a permanent rector. While Father Schulte had performed admirably in his provisionary role, he was ultimately deemed too young for the task, and his qualifications insufficient. Instead, Father Denis J. O'Connell was selected for the job and became the College's fourth rector by election of the Propaganda on June 8, 1885. Papal confirmation followed a few days later, and Schulte's brief but important term as pro-rector came to an end. Unfortunately, however, the appointment of a new rector came as a shock to Schulte. He had been assured by Cardinal Gibbons at the beginning of his service: \\"You will in all probability, continue to act as Rector, and every day will be removing the youth, the only objection which exists against you.\\" That promise, however, proved imprudent. He would later lament to Gibbons concerning his departure: \\"It is possibly providential, at least I should view it as such, but your Grace, knowing my love and affection for the College, will easily understand that it was by no means very agreeable.\\" Later life After leaving Rome in June 1885, Schulte was named professor of liturgy, Latin, and French at his alma mater, St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook. He began that assignment on September 8, 1885. He served as master of discipline there from September 1886 until February 1898, and in addition to that responsibility, bursar of the seminary from 1886 to 1908. On November 10, 1885 he enrolled as a charter member of the North American College's alumni association. Schulte was incapacitated by illness from 1927 onwards, and died at the age of 81 on May 23, 1937 while still in residence at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, which today is located in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. Scholarship Schulte was the author of two works on liturgy: Benedicenda (New York, 1907), and Consecranda (New York, 1907), which have been reprinted several times. He also wrote numerous articles on liturgical subjects for the Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907‚Äì1914) and wrote for the American Ecclesiastical Review (Washington, D.C.) under the pseudonyms \\"S.L.E.\\" and \\"S.L.T.\\" References and notes References Works cited  Further reading * 1856 births 1937 deaths 19th-century Roman Catholic priests 20th-century Roman Catholic priests American people of German descent Clergy from Philadelphia St. Charles Borromeo Seminary faculty Pontifical North American College alumni Pontifical North American College rectors ","title":"Augustine Schulte"},{"id":"48668615","text":"Panweichi Kaleopa is an American Samoan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Leone Lions and the American Samoa national football team.

Assisted by accomplice Jimmy Lee \\"Youngblood\\" Smith, Powell took the officers to an onion field near Bakersfield, California, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot. page 747 Infamously known as the \\"Onion Field\\" Killer, Powell's story was depicted in Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 non-fiction book, The Onion Field. The book was later made into a 1979 film adaptation of the same name in which Powell was portrayed by James Woods. page 222 Biography Early life Powell was raised in Michigan by a dysfunctional family. His father was a musician who was often absent during his childhood and his mother had health problems, leaving Powell to take care of his three younger siblings. At age 15, Powell ran away from his home and hitchhiked to Florida, where he met a Catholic priest and they had a brief sexual relationship. page 49 At age 16, he stole money and a car from his sister; he stole another car when he was 18. page 85 Powell served time in Michigan for car theft. When he was 20, Powell was released from prison. At one point in his life, after he and his family moved to California, Powell underwent a craniectomy or a craniotomy at Vacaville Medical Facility to remove a brain tumor. Powell was frequently in and out of prison; by the time he was 29 years old, ten of the last 13 years of his life were spent behind bars. He was officially paroled in May 1962. Powell worked as a thief and had often robbed liquor stores. He also worked as a gay hustler. As of January 1963, Powell had been responsible for a series of armed robberies in Las Vegas. At the time of the kidnapping, Powell was residing in Boulder City, Nevada. Kidnapping of Campbell and Hettinger At about 10:00 p.m. on March 9, 1963, in Hollywood, Officers Campbell and Hettinger pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe with Nevada license plates at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street for an illegal U-turn. Present in the vehicle were Powell and his accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith. According to Powell, \\"...when the officers stopped our car, we had our guns ready.\\" After Powell was ordered to get out of the car, he disarmed Campbell by pointing a gun at his head and threatened to kill him. Hettinger did not put down his gun until Campbell told him to. page 96 With Smith's help, Powell abducted both of the officers and forced Campbell to drive them to an onion field in Bakersfield. Murder of Campbell and arrest When they arrived at the onion field, the officers were forced out of the car and ordered to stand with their hands above their heads. Powell asked Campbell, \\"Have you ever heard of the Little Lindbergh Law?\\" After Campbell replied, \\"Yes\\", he was shot in the face, specifically the mouth. According to Hettinger, it was Powell who shot Campbell on the face; he then told the Los Angeles Times, \\"I knew I was next. I turned away and ran down the road. When I looked back, they fired at me....\\" Hettinger successfully managed to escape from Powell and Smith, running to a farmhouse. page 489 It is believed that the four other bullets that hit Campbell's chest were fired by both Smith and Powell. However, Powell claimed that Smith fired the four other shots whereas the latter claimed the former fired them. Powell was arrested a few hours later by a CHP officer after attempting to escape via a stolen car. Although Powell was armed at the time of his arrest, he showed no resistance. Smith was arrested the next day. Conviction and imprisonment On September 4, 1963, Powell was convicted of the kidnapping of Campbell and Hettinger and of the murder of the former. He was sentenced to death in November that same year. Retrial and escape attempts In July 1967, Powell was granted a second trial; once again, he was convicted and sentenced to death. Later that year, Powell unsuccessfully attempted to escape from San Quentin State Prison with three other inmates. In 1968, he attempted to smuggle guns into the Los Angeles County Jail, and in 1969, he attempted to escape its recreation room. Commutation By 1972, his sentence was commuted to life in prison when the state of California declared the death penalty unconstitutional. Parole denied Powell was originally scheduled for parole on June 13, 1982. A petition submitted by the group Citizens for Truth in Justice garnered 31,500 signatures protesting against parole, which led to the rescission of Powell's parole date. The group was assisted in its effort by Powell's victim's daughter, Valerie Campbell. Powell was able to obtain an order of release from Solano County Superior Court Judge Ellis Randall. However, John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, was able to submit a legal brief to the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco ordering Powell to remain in prison. The case then went to the California Supreme Court, where Mancino and his group prevailed. California Governors George Deukmejian and Jerry Brown were against Powell being released. Powell's lawyer, Dennis Riordan, blamed it on a February 1982 TV airing of The Onion Field. Between 1982 page 9 and 2010, Powell had been denied parole 11 times. Powell had worked as a clerk in the law library at the Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California. By 1994, Powell was incarcerated at Deuel Vocational Institution. In 2011, Powell had also been denied compassionate release despite a diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. Reaction to The Onion Field Joseph Wambaugh, author of The Onion Field, interviewed Powell while he was in prison. According to Wambaugh, Powell had only one complaint about the book, \\"that he [Powell] thought he was more physically attractive than I portrayed him to be.\\" Wambaugh also confirmed that one of Powell's lawyers claimed Powell would have been released from prison had it not been for the book or its film adaptation. Media portrayal Powell was portrayed by actor James Woods in the 1979 film The Onion Field. Woods did not meet with Powell when preparing for his role. Woods was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in the film. Death On August 12, 2012, Powell died of prostate cancer at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California. He was 79 years old. His death occurred two days after a Hollywood intersection was dedicated in Officer Ian Campbell's name. Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, issued a statement: \\"Gregory Powell was a cold-blooded murderer who avoided the death penalty, but he won't escape God's judgment. While Officer Ian Campbell can never be brought back, nor the damage and heartache caused by Powell and Smith be undone, justice was upheld when the parole board denied Powell's request for compassionate release and ensured he drew his last breath while confined behind prison bars.\\" References External links * 1933 births 2012 deaths American robbers American kidnappers American people convicted of murder People convicted of murder by California People from Michigan People from Boulder City, Nevada Deaths from cancer in California Deaths from prostate cancer 1963 murders in the United States ","title":"Gregory Powell (murderer)"},{"id":"48668647","text":"Aprominta marthae is a moth in the family Autostichidae.

Lengnau as seen from the L√§gern chain Tegerfelden towards Leibstadt Ehrendingen and Lengnau towards Leibstadt  Geography  The Surbtal (literally Surb valley) is situated parallel to the Limmat Valley (Limmattal) in the Baden and Zurzach districts of the Canton of Aargau in Switzerland. The valley is bounded by moraines of the Linth glacier; and in the east it passes over to the border of the Canton of Z√ºrich respectively the drainage basin of the Wehn Valley (native German name: Wehntal). Surbtal comprises the area of the municipalities: * D√∂ttingen * Endingen * Ehrendingen * Freienwil * Lengnau * Schneisingen * Tegerfelden  Surb  The Surb is a long river in the Swiss cantons of Aargau and Z√ºrich, where she rises on an altitude of MAMSL at the municipality of Sch√∂fflisdorf. The river drains the northern Wehntal, passing the municipalities of Ehrendingen, Lengnau, Endingen, Unterendingen and Tegerfelden in the Surbtal. South of the village center of D√∂ttingen, the Surb joins the Aare.  History  About 185,000 years ago, a side lobe of the Walensee/Reinglacier overlapped on the threshold at the present Pfannenstiel eastern slope from Hombrechtikon into the Glatttal towards Niederweningen, and eroded the overdeepened rock rut of the present Wehntal area. After another glacial maximum about 140,000 years ago, the ice melted in the last Eemian (interglacial) period back far into the alpine valleys, and great lakes with border union fens filled the former glacial basin. Following the W√ºrm glaciation, during the last glacial maximum about 24,000 years ago, the glaciers pushed again to the lower Glatt Valley. With the increasing warming period about 20,000 years ago, the glaciers melted away in stages to Z√ºrich, later Hurden and formed the Seedamm at the Obersee lake shore respectively the Ufenau, L√ºtzelau and Heilig H√ºsli islands on Z√ºrichsee, and finally the glaciers retreated into the alpine mountains. The oldest settlement findings date back to the Neolithic period. From Roman times there are finds at various locations, including a villa rustica in Lengnau. In the Early and High Middle Ages the monasteries of St. Gallen and Einsiedeln had possessions in the Surbtal, later particularly the St. Blasien Abbey. Ulrich I von Regensberg at the Regensberg CastleThe grave stone of Ulrich I von Regensberg in later centuries was misused as a loophole cornice of the Oebenbach bulwark on the Sihlb√ºhl hill in Z√ºrich. The heartland of the possessions of the medieval House of Regensberg was in the Furt and Wehn valleys besides the L√§gern chain, where around 1050 AD the family built its ancestral seat Altburg near Z√ºrich- Affoltern, and two centuries later Neu-Regensberg on the eastern L√§gern slope. In the 13th century the upper Surbtal (Lengnau) was controlled by the Counts of Regensberg, the lower valley by the families von Tegerfelden and later von Klingen. In 1269 Walther von Klingen sold his rights along with the town of Klingnau to the Bishop of Constance. The Regensberg family was ousted by the Habsburg family and the city of Z√ºrich in the second half of the 13th century. In 1415 the valley came, as part of the Grafschaft Baden (bailiwicks of Siggen and Ehrendingen), to the Old Swiss Confederancy. In 1528, during the Reformation in Z√ºrich, Niederweningen remained Roman Catholic; in Endingen, Tegerfelden and Unterendingen still lived Reformed minorities. In 1803 the Surbtal came as part of the county of Baden to the present Canton of Aargau.  Surbtaler Juden  Two separate doors (one for Jews and one for Christians) on a house in Endingen 1754 drawing of the Endingen cemetery by Johann Caspar Ulrich Jewish cemetery in Endingen Synagoge in Lengnau Synagoge Z√ºrich- L√∂wenstrasse The Surbtal was significantly influenced by the so-called Surbtaler Juden (literally Surbtal Jews). After the 1250s pogroms in Switzerland, between 1623 and 1633 the Jewish population in Switzerland was expelled from all Swiss municipalities and settled in Oberlengnau ‚Äì finally, they were 'allowed' to settle only in Lengnau and Endingen, in accordance with a resolution of the Tagsatzung in 1678. Their vernacular, the Surbtaler Jiddisch (literally Surbtal Yiddish), was one of the last spoken dialects of the Western Yiddish language in the late 20th century. Today there are only a few, mostly elderly Jews who know the dialect, and in the 1970s the sound archives began recording what is left of the dialect. In 1976 Florence Guggenheim-Gr√ºnberg, a Swiss linguist and historian, published a dictionary of the Surbtal Yiddish. Because of the proximity to the fairs/markets in Zurzach, as from the 17th century also settled Jewish merchants in Lengnau and Endingen, as the Jewish citizens were not allowed to operate agriculture or exercise a craft. Livelihood they earned mainly on the internationally important Zurzach fair and the market in Baden. From 1696 all Jewish inhabitants had to buy all 16 years expensive protective shield letters from the Landvogt of Baden. From 1776 the right of residence of all Jews in Switzerland was definitely limited to Endingen and Lengnau. Since they were allowed to stay during the night only in the two villages, their radius of action was strongly limited. At the same time, the Jews of the Surbtal formed a Beth din or rabbinical court with Tiengen. The Jewish citizens built two large synagogues, in 1765 in Endingen (rebuilt in 1852) and in Lengnau in 1750 (rebuilt 1847). Beginning in 1603, the deceased Jews of the Surbtal communities were buried on a small Rhein river island, the so-called Juden√§ule (\\"Jew's island\\") which was leased by the Jewish community. As the island was repeatedly flooded and devastated, in 1750 the Surbtal Jews asked the Tagsatzung to establish a cemetery in the vicinity of their communities in the Surb valley. Once a year, the communal chevra kadisha (hevra kadishah, Aramaic: ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ê ◊ß◊ì◊ô◊©◊ê, ·∏§ebh'ra Qaddisha, meaning \\"holy society\\") visited the graves on the island. In 1750 the Tagsatzung 'allowed' the Jewish communities of Endingen and Lengnau to acquire woodland on a small hill between Endingen and Lengnau to establish the Endingen cemetery. The cemetery has been expanded several times; based on an 1859 agreement, two-fifths of the cemetery belong to the Israelite community of Lengnau, and three-fifths to the Israelite community of Endingen. However, the Jewish residents were only allowed to enter a few professions, such as trade, particularly as livestock dealers and so on. Houses were built with two separate entrances, one for Jews and one for Christians. They were under the high and low courts of the Baden bailiff. In general, the Jewish population was fairly well tolerated (except for the Zwetschgenkrieg or \\"plum war\\"), self-managed and maintained its own school. In March 1798 the French revolutionary troops overturned the Swiss regime and proclaimed the Helvetic Republic; the Surb region now belonged to the short- lived Canton of Baden from 1798 to 1803. The new state was soon hated in large parts of the population. This hatred erupted on 21 September 1802 during the so-called Zwetschgenkrieg against the Jewish fellow citizens, who were considered supporters of the new liberal government. A horde of over 800 residents from neighboring villages fell over Endingen and Lengnau, and enriched themselves from the belongings of those defenseless Jews, while the Christian inhabitants were largely unmolested. The first Swiss Federal Constitution of 12 September 1848 provided for the cantons' sovereignty, as long as this did not impinge on the Federal Constitution. Among others, Jewish citizens from Endingen and Lengnau, 80 Jewish women, children and men in all, were allowed by the authorities to settle in the whole territory of the Canton of Zurich in 1850, in 1862 about 175 people, including 100 in the Z√ºrich district. The first Jewish community in the city of Z√ºrich within the past 438 years, exceptionally appreciated the support by the city authorities. In 1866 the Swiss Federal Constitution granted freedom of establishment and in 1874 freedom of worship, whereupon to about 1920, most of the Jewish citizens left the Surbtal. After the repeal of the majority of the legal restrictions on Jewish citizens on 3 March 1862, on 29 March 1862 the Israelitischer Kultusverein (Jewish society) was founded by 12 members in Z√ºrich, and in 1880 its name was changed in the present Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Z√ºrich (ICZ). On 16 September 1884 their first synagogue, Synagoge Z√ºrich L√∂wenstrasse was inaugurated. In 1879 the Jewish village of Neu-Endingen was built which remained mostly independent until 1983 when it merged back into the village of Endingen.  Transportation  After the Wehntalbahn railway was not continued towards the Surbtal in 1891, in 1921 a Postauto bus line was opened. Until 1954 the completion of the cantonal Surbtalstrasse road was carried out. From the 1960s trade, industrial arts and light industry companies settled in the still rural Surbtal region.

Built about 1835, it has served as a school, fire station, Masonic hall, tin shop, undertaker's shop, and as the clubhouse of a local brass band. Despite some alteration, it is a well-preserved example of a mid-19th century Greek Revival schoolhouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Graftion District Schoolhouse No. 2 is located on the east side of Grafton village, on the north side of Main Street (Vermont Route 121), just west of its junction with Chester Road (Vermont Route 35). It stands east of the Grafton Post Office, and across the street from the public library, both individually listed on the National Register. The schoolhouse is a two-story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a fieldstone foundation. The building corners are pilasters, supporting an entablature that encircles the building, and the gable is fully pedimented. The front facade is symmetrical, with two 20th-century overhead doors on the ground floor, and two sash windows above. The side elevations are four bays deep, and there is a pedestrian entrance in the leftmost bay on the right side. The building's construction date is unknown, and is assumed to be in the 1830s or 1840s based on its Greek Revival character. It is possible that the building's second story is in fact an older (c. 1811) structure, based on architectural evidence. It was used as a school until 1867, after which time it saw a variety of commercial and civic uses, notably as a Masonic lodge, undertaker's shop, and tin shop. In 1922 the Grafton Cornet Band took over the upper level, which it continues to use today. The ground floor was converted into a fire station in 1939, at which time most of the original interior was lost, as were the original entry doors on the main facade. It housed the town's main fire station until 1992, and the ground floor is again used as a retail space. The building is owned and maintained by a local preservation group.

It is representative of areas with dark taiga tree cover (92% of the park is forested). With an area of , the park covers over a third of Tashtagolsky District at the southern end of Kemerovo Oblast, about south of the city of Kemerovo. The area is the home of the Shors people, and has historically been associated with mining and logging industries before being established as a protected area in 1989. Topography Most of the park is of medium-sized mountains, with deep river valleys. The mountains average in height above sea level, with a maximum of on Kubez Mountain. On the west it is bordered by a spur of the higher Altai mountain range, and to the east by the Abakan Range. The Mrassu River (meaning \\"Siberian Pine River\\" in the Shor language), is the main river through the park, running from north to south through its middle. The park stretches 110 km north to south, and 90 km east to west. Much of the geology is karst landscape, with soluble rocks such as limestone creating the conditions for springs, caves, and unusual rock formations. Shor, Tashtogal District The park provides paths and access to particular land-forms of interest. These include the \\"Saga Waterfall\\", a multi-tier cascade over rocks to a calm pool and grotto from a height of 15 meters; the \\"Tsar's Gate\\" rocks, a large formation with a hole through it on a rise over the Mrassu river; the \\"Moonlight\\" cave, 200 meters long and covered inside with stalactites and stalagmites; the \\"Azasskoy\\" cave, which boasts a large gallery; and over 60 other named caves and outcrops. Climate The climate of Shorsky is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The area as unusual characteristics due to the distance from ocean, the topography of the surrounding area, and the local westerly winds ‚Äì the park is an area of local high temperatures and high precipitation (rainfall averages 950 mm/year, and average snow cover is 70 cm). Plants The park is in the Altai-Sayan montane coniferous forest ecoregion. The forested area is southern Siberian tiaga, with Siberian pine and Siberian fir being the most common trees. Less common are spruce, pine and aspen; willows are found along low floodplains. The diversity of plants in Shorksy reflects the park's position as a forested transition zone between the Altair mountains and the lower Siberian lands. The park has recorded 51 species of tree and bush, over 600 vascular plants, 300 species of moss, and over 200 species of mushrooms. Animals Large mammals in the park include brown bear, red deer, roe deer, mink, and sable (for which is the area is particularly known). There are 61 recorded mammal species, 183 bird species, and 14 species of fish. Other predatory mammals include wolf, fox, wolverine, weasel, ermine, mink, otter, badger, and lynx. There are relatively few species associated with steppe and forest-steppe landscapes. History The indigenous Shor people have traditionally considered this area their home. Historically, they have been known in Russia for their iron-smelting skills, and for their practice of Shamanism. Today, there are small Shor villages in the park along the river banks. Active logging in the area ceased after creation of the park, and the mature forest is now growing. Tourism Visitors are welcome; hiking, horseback riding, climbing, and caving are popular. Tickets to the protected area can be obtained at the park headquarters in the town of Tashtagol. Tour guides in the area provided guided hikes, rafting tours on the Mrassu River, and facilities outside the park. There are three shelters in the park in which visitors can stay in wooden huts in all seasons.

As usual the chassis was also available to coach builders. The 16hp Two- litre was supplemented by then later replaced by the much more expensive better equipped 2-litre Rover Meteor 16 announced in February 1930.  Overview  Announced in September 1927 the Rover Two-litre was one of the Rover cars manufactured when Spencer and Maurice Wilks, who joined Rover's team in 1929 and 1930, introduced new management practices and engineering techniques to Rover. Engine The Two-litre was powered by a watercooled 2 L straight-6 OHV engine with an output of 45 bhp at 3600 rpm designed by Peter Poppe, which allowed a maximum speed of 60 mph (97 km/h). The bore of 65 mm put the engine into the 16 hp taxation class. Poppe's new engine became the basis for all but one of the Rover engines until the new design introduced with Rover's P3 in 1948. The car was supplied with a three-speed gearbox controlled by a lever in the centre of the car. The lever was flexible, operated in a gate and had a stop to avoid engaging reverse. The engine clutch and gearbox assembly is mounted and supported at three points, the single one in front, the rear pair by horizontally U-shaped leaf spring attachments. Brakes suspension steering The suspension was conventional for the time with half elliptic leaf springs all round mounted above the axles. The pedal brakes work shoes in enclosed drums on all four wheels by rods but the handbrake uses those on the back wheels and operates them by chain. There are shock absorbers fore and aft. Body As with its predecessors standard bodies were very light weight rattle free fabric bodywork built by Rover under licence from Weymann. The standard 2/3-seater or 5-seater open tourer 2-litre was introduced at a price of ¬£410. A short wheelbase two-door \\"Sportsman's Saloon\\" version became available during the last two years of production for ¬£335. All cars became available with a 4-speed gearbox as an optional extra for ¬£7, it was a standard fitting to the limousine. The clutch pedal is adjustable for travel and the front seat can be adjusted over a range of six inches using wing nuts in the cushion. The short-wheelbase narrow track sportsman's saloon variant of this Two-litre car, the Rover Light Six won attention when it was the first successful participant in the Blue Train Races, a series of record-breaking attempts between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race against the Le Train Bleu, a train that ran between Calais and the French Riviera.

(The book's title appears in truncated form on this page.) Katharine Murray Lyell (1817‚Äì1915) was a British botanist, author of an early book on the worldwide distribution of ferns, and editor of volumes of the correspondence of several of the era's notable scientists. Biography Katharine Murray Horner was one of six daughters of the Scottish merchant and geologist Leonard Horner. Leonard Horner educated his daughters well and took them with him to meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Katharine Horner's older sister Mary was a geologist and conchologist who married the geologist Charles Lyell. Katharine Horner subsequently married Charles Lyell's younger brother, Henry. Their oldest son, Leonard, became a member of Parliament. As a botanist, Katharine Lyell specialized in ferns and in 1870 published a volume on the geographic distribution of ferns worldwide. In her preface, she acknowledges a debt to William Jackson Hooker's unfinished compendium of ferns, Synopsis Filicum (posthumously published in 1868), but Lyell's book was the first to be organized around the geography of ferns rather than more usual taxonomic categories. She traveled to India with Henry, where she collected plants in several regions including the Ganges delta, and she corresponded with such eminent Victorians of her day as the scientists Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin and the missionary Harriette Colenso (who collected ferns for her). Her fern collection is shared between Kew Gardens and The University of Reading Herbarium (RNG), while her other plants went to the British Museum. Lyell undertook the editorship of volumes of correspondence and memoirs of three of her era's outstanding scientists. When her brother-in-law Charles died in 1875, she became the compiler and editor of a two-volume edition of his life, letters, and journals. A decade later, following her father's death, she edited two volumes of his letters. She also edited the life and letters of another of her brothers-in-law, Charles Bunbury, a noted paleobotanist. All are still being cited by scholars researching the period. Publications *Katharine Lyell. A Geographical Handbook of All the Known Ferns: With Tables to Show Their Distribution.

Wolfe was born in Raleigh, NC, and moved to Texas when she was 8 years old. She started playing guitar at the age of 5 and also started to play drums at an early age. In her college years at St. Edward's University she began to perform live. Her debut EP, Roulette, self-released in 2014, was produced by Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Patty Griffin, and And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead). That same year she toured with Allen Stone, performed at Austin City Limits, BottleRock Napa, and South by Southwest, and toured the west coast. In 2016, Wolfe was featured in Uproxx's \\"Uncharted Series\\" and returned for live dates on the west coast, as well as toured and performed with Gary Clark Jr., The Toadies, Heart, The Pretenders, and performed at Sound on Sound Fest in Texas. In 2017, she began production for her first full-length album, with Alabama Shakes keyboardist Ben Tanner (St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Dylan LeBlanc) producing. The album was recorded at Portside Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, and features Evan Nicholson on bass and Clellan Hyatt on drums. In attempting to bring to life Wolfe's dream of mixing Demi Lovato and Queens of the Stone Age, she has said, \\"I wanted to explore weird combinations that seem bizarre. I noticed that in pop music, whenever the chorus hits, they put this airy synth in the back of every single pop hit - I‚Äôm like, Okay, we‚Äôve got to figure out how to make that happen. That seems to lift the chorus out of the song, making it a monster on its own. I also had a massive folder of just samples ‚Äì I asked Ben to pick the coolest ones to see if we could use them on the record.‚Äù The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ in February 2020 Of striving to incorporate this idea with Wolfe's live-show energy, Tanner has said, \\"The way pop music works - when the chorus hits or the solo hits - things get really tall, and changes in the high end and low end make it feel huge. It‚Äôs more produced than just these three people playing together in a room, but you don‚Äôt want it to be so overly produced or overly polished that it loses the flow of who Emily is an artist. A lot of it‚Äôs in the moment - if we can make it elicit an emotional response in ourselves, then hopefully it will in somebody else, too.‚Äù That self-titled, self-released album was released February 15, 2019. A co-billed tour with Black Pistol Fire followed through the east coast and midwest, followed by multiple headline dates through the east coast, midwest, and west coast, including 3rd & Lindsley in Nashville, WTMD‚Äôs First Thursday concert series in Baltimore, Baby‚Äôs All Right in Brooklyn, Lincoln Calling Festival in Nebraska, The Mint in Los Angeles, The Independent in San Francisco, and the Empty Bottle in Chicago. In May 2019, the single ‚ÄúHoly Roller‚Äù was serviced to AAA radio, with support from 20+ stations, and remained on that format's charts for four-plus months. An extensive radio promotional tour included visits to stations in Nashville, Baltimore, Albany, Woodstock, Pittsburgh, and Columbus, Ohio. The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ in February 2020 Wolfe's work has received praise from NPR, The Wall Street Journal, MTV, and numerous online and regional press outlets.

B6. The teams have met nine times, between November 1906 and November 2017. They have faced off twice in bowl games, first in the 2003 Independence Bowl and second in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic. The rivalry was formally introduced in 2014, and the Battle Line trophy was first awarded in 2015. History Pre-SEC era The first meeting between the Razorbacks and Tigers was in 1906. Missouri won 11‚Äì0 in Columbia, Missouri. The two teams played each other in out of conference, regular season games in 1906, 1944, and 1963. They have met in bowl games twice. SEC era Missouri leads the series 4‚Äì1 since the schools began playing as SEC foes in 2014. The teams did not play in 2012 and 2013, the first two years Missouri was a member of the conference. Starting in 2015, the winner of the game received a silver trophy outlining the states of Missouri and Arkansas with the words \\"Battle Line\\" on the border between the states. In 2014, Missouri's victory gave them a spot in the SEC Championship. The series has been played on Black Friday since 2014. The location of the games changes every year between Fayetteville, Arkansas in Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium and Columbia, Missouri on Faurot Field. Missouri won the first meeting as SEC opponents 21‚Äì14 in Columbia. In the first game that the trophy was on the line, the Razorbacks won 28‚Äì3. The Tigers captured the trophy for the first time in 2016, overcoming a 24‚Äì7 halftime deficit to win 28‚Äì24 in Columbia. In 2017 the Tigers kept the trophy winning 48‚Äì45 on a last second 19-yard field goal by kicker Tucker Mccann. Prior to 2014, Arkansas played LSU in the Battle for the Golden Boot in its regular season finale every year since joining the SEC in 1992. LSU now plays Texas A&M; in its regular season finale. Missouri faced the Aggies to close the 2012 and 2013 regular seasons in a continuation of the former Big 12 Conference series. Arkansas will bring game back to War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock in alternating years when the Razorbacks are hosting the Tigers, from 2019 to 2024. A year later, Missouri and the Kansas City Chiefs agreed to move the rivalry game in 2020 to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 game was moved back to Columbia, instead of Kansas City.

First seen in 2008, it was formally described in 2012. It is found only in Vietnam, and only at two places, C√°t B√† Island in northern Vietnam, and Ch∆∞ Mom Ray National Park. It is generally similar to the species complex of the great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger), with which it shares the habitat, but has distinguishing characters. It is relatively smaller and its sound navigation, echolocation, is different. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature report, it became one of the 367 important new species discovered in the Greater Mekong during 2012 and 2013. Etymology Griffin's leaf-nosed bat is named after Donald Redfield Griffin, a professor of zoology at Rockefeller University in New York, who discovered animal echolocation. Discovery Griffin's leaf-nosed bat was first noticed by Vu Dinh Thong in Ch∆∞ Mom Ray National Park in 2008, during a three-year survey of bats in Vietnam. His research team was supported by the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP), the Harrison Institute, the University of T√ºbingen, and the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources. He collected the first museum specimen, now the holotype, on 20 August 2009. It is an adult male found in the C√°t B√† National Park, C√°t B√† Island, in Ha Long Bay. Vu Dinh Thong initially thought that it was a species of Hipposideros armiger but soon realised that its behaviour was different. The new bat remained calm when captured, while other species are always aggressive. Studies of the echolocation pattern and DNA analyses (cytochrome-b gene and partial D-loop sequences) revealed that it was a different species. The formal scientific description was published in the 16 February 2012 issue of the Journal of Mammalogy. Description Griffin's leaf-nosed bat is similar to the species complex of Hipposideros armiger, but with distinct acoustics, size, and DNA sequence. The sound frequencies for echolocation ranges from 76.6 to 79.2 kHz, which is higher than the frequencies produced by H. armiger subspecies, which range from 64.7 to 71.4 kHz. Its wing is 8.3‚Äì9 cm long. Its head measures 2.8‚Äì3. cm. Its nose is like a layer of leaves, and the anterior leaf has 4 supplementary leaflets of which the 2nd is the widest and longest, while the outermost is narrow and short. The tip of the ear, pinnais 2.35‚Äì2.65 cm wide and 2.75‚Äì3 cm high. The body colour varies from brown to gray.

Gupta (; born 1949) is an Indian-American philosopher who works primarily in logic, epistemology, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. Gupta is the Alan Ross Anderson Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.List of the Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (PDF) His most recent book, Conscious Experience: A Logical Inquiry, was published by Harvard University Press in 2019.  Biography  Gupta earned his B.Sc. with first class honours from the University of London in 1969. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh where he received his M.A. (1973) and Ph.D. (1977). Gupta has taught at several universities: McGill University (1975-1982), University of Illinois at Chicago (1982-1989), Indiana University (1989-2000).Biographical information from Gupta's CV (PDF) In 2001 Gupta joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh where he served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and, since 2013, as Alan Ross Anderson Chair.Gupta's profile at the University of Pittsburgh Revision theory Gupta developed an early version of the revision theory of truth.Gupta (1982). Later he generalized this to a theory of circular and interdependent definitions.Gupta (1988). This work was further developed, resulting in the book, The Revision Theory of Truth, co-written with Nuel Belnap. The revision theory is a semantic theory of truth that combines an unrestricted truth predicate with classical logic.See Gupta and Belnap (1993) for details. Revision theory takes truth to be a circular concept, defined by the Tarski biconditionals, :'A' is true if and only if A, and interprets it in a new way. Rather than interpret the truth predicate via a single extension, as is done with non-circular predicates, revision theory interprets it via a revision process. The revision process is a collection of revision sequences that result when arbitrary hypotheses concerning the interpretation of truth are revised using a rule provided by the Tarski biconditionals. In the revision process, problematic sentences such as the Liar (‚Äúthis very sentence is not true‚Äù) do not settle on a definite truth value. Remarkably, however, ordinary unproblematic sentences do receive a definite truth value. If problematic types of cross-reference are eliminated from the language, then the revision process converges to a fixed point. Gupta has applied revision theory to rational choice in game theory, building on the work of Andr√© Chapuis.See chapter 4 of Gupta (2011). Gupta has recently applied the informal ideas of revision theory to problems arising in the philosophy of perception.See Gupta (2006). Experience and Reformed Empiricism In Empiricism and Experience, Gupta proposes a novel empiricist account of the logical relation between perceptual experience and knowledge.Gupta (2006)Book Symposium on Empiricism and ExperienceNotre Dame Philosophical Reviews entry on Empiricism and Experience The problem Gupta addresses is that of explaining the role of experience in making our views and, in particular, perceptual judgments rational. Gupta's proposal is that the given in experience is hypothetical.Berker (2011) Rather than providing perceptual judgments with categorical rationality, experience confers on these judgments a conditional rationality. A perceptual experience, according to Gupta, makes a subject's judgment rational if the subject's antecedent view is rational.Gupta (2009) An antecedent view is the collection of beliefs, conceptions, and concepts that the subject of an experience brings to bear on the experience. Gupta uses the notion of the hypothetical given to build a reformed empiricism. He argues that this empiricism has significant advantages over the traditional versions of the view.Berker (2011) Among other features, Gupta's empiricism does not require the acceptance of an anti-realism about commonsense and theoretical objects, and it does not rely on the analytic-synthetic distinction to do any substantive work. Finally, Gupta argues that his reformed empiricism incorporates plausible components of both foundationalism and coherentism.Gupta (2006)  Honors and awards  * A.C.L.S.

He and Johnny (The Elder) Kelley share the record (17) for the most Boston Marathons run in under 2 hours and 40 minutes. Kelley finished 58 Boston Marathons between 1933 and 1992 but not consecutively. Beach, who has completed 76 26-mile races including 16 Marine Corps Marathons, is the only person to have run every Cherry Blossom Ten-Mile Race, which was established in 1973. Running Beach grew up in Mount Kisco, New York and began running at 16. After listening to a live radio broadcast of the Boston Marathon when he was a senior at Governor Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts, he decided to enter the race in 1968 when he was a Harvard freshman and had reached the event's minimum age of 18. At the time the race, which numbered just over 1,000 participants, was limited to males and had no qualifying standards. \\"I remember I was completely unprepared,\\" said Beach. \\"I really didn't have any idea how you prepare for one of those things.\\" Beach finished his debut marathon in 3 hours, 23 minutes and 50 seconds and has raced in Boston every year since. \\"I didn't embark on this with any sense that I would do this for the rest of my life,\\" said Beach, whose top placement was 34th in 1985 and best time was 2:27:26 in 1981. Beach, whose fastest clocking at the distance is 2:26:29 at the 1981 New York City Marathon, won the Midnight Sun Marathon in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1976 and the Gettysburg Marathon in 1978. Beach reached the top of the list of what Boston Marathon organizers call 'streakers' in 2013 after longtime leader Neil Weygandt opted not to enter. His bid to break the record of 45 in a row was aborted that year when the twin terrorist bombings near the finish line on Boylston Street prompted officials to halt the race. Though Beach was prevented from continuing just before he reached Kenmore Square, approximately a mile from the finish, the Boston Athletic Association later ruled that runners who had reached the midway point when the event was stopped would be considered to have finished. While his times have slowed significantly due to dystonia, a movement disorder that began to damage his stride in 2002, Beach perennially has been able to finish before the official six-hour cutoff. \\"It's a part of me at this point,\\" he said. \\"And it's something to challenge me.

It is located along the eastern shore of Lake Abert on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the Oregon Department of Transportation. The site includes stone-walled house pits and prehistoric rock art made by ancient Native Americans who occupied the site for approximately 11,000 years. Because of its unique archaeological and cultural significance, the East Lake Abert Archaeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  Prehistoric environment  Following the last Ice Age, melt water accumulated in the closed basins of what is now south-central Oregon. As a result, pluvial lakes covered much of Oregon's high desert country. This included the area around what is now Lake Abert. During this period, the area was home to mammoths, bison, horses, camels, and mountain sheep. The abundant wildlife drew prehistoric hunters to the area as well.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 21‚Äì23.Cressman, Luther S., The Sandal and the Cave, Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Beaver Books, Portland, Oregon, 1964, pp. 40‚Äì41.Richard, Terry, \\"Paisley Caves added to U.S. list of most important archaeological sites\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 5 October 2014. About 7,500 years ago, the climate changed and the great pluvial lakes began to recede. As the lakes shrank, the mammoths, horses, and camels disappeared. Nevertheless, the area around Lake Abert and the marshes and meadows along the Chewaucan River, south and west of the lake, remained ideal habitat for wildlife including numerous small mammal species and many varieties of waterfowl. As a result, ancient people continued to occupy the area around Lake Abert.Aikens, C. Melvin, \\"Lake Abert\\" (PDF), Archaeology of Oregon, Lake Abert, Bureau of Land Management, Oregon Office, United States Department of the Interior, Portland, Oregon, 1993, pp. 38‚Äì39. Little is known about the people who occupied the land, except that they lived and hunted near ancient Lake Abert.Cressman, Luther S., The Sandal and the Cave, Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Beaver Books, Portland, Oregon, 1964, pp. 21‚Äì22. Early inhabitants camped, built villages, and carved petroglyphs on boulders along the east shore of Lake Abert for approximately 11,000 years. Over that long period of time, the area had one of the highest human occupation densities found anywhere in the northern region of the Great Basin.Beauchamp, Douglas, \\"Introduction‚Äù (PDF), Material and Remembrance: Three Fractured Petroglyph Boulders, Lake County, Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, January 2013, p. 7.  Archeological surveys  There have been two major archeological surveys conducted along the eastern shore of Lake Abert. The first survey was conducted between 1932 and 1935 by Luther Cressman. In 1975 and 1976, David L. Cole and Richard M. Pettigrew of the University of Oregon conducted a second survey prior to a highway project to realign a section of U.S. Route 395, which runs along the eastern shore of Lake Abert. The two archeological surveys identified a significant number of important cultural assets including house pits, domestic artifacts, petroglyphs, and pictographs. In 1985, a team from the University of Oregon published a comprehensive summary of known archeological sites around Lake Abert.Cressman, L. S., Petroglyphs of Oregon, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, June 1937, p. 27.Gilsen, Leland, \\"Prehistoric Architecture of Oregon\\", Prehistoric Architecture of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 13 April 2014. The Lake Abert sites represent at least 11,000 years of human occupation. Archeologists have divided the occupation timeline into six periods. The oldest is the Initial Archaic period from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. This period is identified by the Great Basin stemmed projectile points found at the Initial Archaic sites. The second period is the Early Archaic which stretched from 7,000 to 4,000 years ago. This period is identified by the northern side-notched points found at Early Archaic locations. The Middle Archaic period covers 4,000 to 2,000 years ago and is divided into two sub-periods. The earlier sub-period is identified by the Gatecliff split-stem points found at its sites, and the more recent sub-period is identified by its Elko series points. The Late Archaic period, which lasted from 2,000 years ago until the mid-18th century, also has two sub-periods. The earlier sub-period is identified by a mix of Elko and Rosegate series points found at its locations, and the last period has only Rosegate points. Because the prehistoric house pits and petroglyphs along the eastern shore of Lake Abert have great archeological value and are located on federal lands, they have been identified for protection. Like most government- owned prehistoric cultural and rock art sites, the Lake Abert location is officially designated as an \\"Area of Critical Environmental Concern\\". This ensures that these valuable cultural resources are preserved and protected.\\"Cultural Resources\\" (PDF), Summary of the Analysis of the Management Situation for the Lakeview Resource Area ‚Äì Resource Management Plan, Lakeview Field Office, Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of the Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, July 2000, pp. 2.28‚Äì2.29.Beauchamp, Douglas, \\"Introduction‚Äù, Material and Remembrance: Three Fractured Petroglyph Boulders, Lake County, Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, January 2013, p. 5. Because of its cultural significance and unique archaeological value, the East Lake Abert Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 29 November 1978. The Bureau of Land Management has mapped and documented the Lake Abert archeological sites to record its condition. Photographs are used to compare site conditions over time. Volunteers from the Archaeological Society of Central Oregon help Bureau of Land Management cultural and law enforcement specialists monitor the site.Preserve America Report (PDF), Cultural Resource Management Program, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., September 2004, p. 18.  House pits  The original archeological surveys located 32 prehistoric sites along a section of the eastern shore of Lake Abert. These sites include 21 village areas with at least 371 house pits; 51 of these are round stonewall house pits. Five additional sites have cultural debris, but no house pits. The remaining six sites are clusters of petroglyphs. By 1990, an additional 280 sites were identified. Today, over 580 house pits and 70 rock rings have been identified at the Lake Abert sites. Many of these sites also have fire hearths, grinding stones, and flaked stone debris. There are very few house pits from the Initial or Early Archaic periods. Most of the villages were built during the Middle Archaic period, so their use period is within the past 4,000 years.  Petroglyphs  The East Lake Abert Archeological District has six rock art groupings plus a number of stand-alone petroglyphs and pictographs located throughout the district. All of the rock art is found on loose boulders that have rolled down from Abert Rim. During the two archeological site surveys, numerous petroglyphs were recorded along with 92 pictographs. There are also some combined or overlapping designs that include both petroglyph and pictograph features. The rock art designs include both creatures and geometric designs. Among the animal figures are snakes, lizards, and horned toads. Some of the snakes are obviously rattlesnakes, with rattles clearly visible as part of the design. The geometric designs include circles, loops, wavy lines, and some more complex patterns.  Location  The East Lake Abert Archeological District is in Lake County, Oregon. The district covers approximately of Bureau of Land Management and Oregon Department of Transportation land along a section of U.S. Route 395. This section of highway is located between the small unincorporated community of Valley Falls and the north end of Lake Abert. While some of the house pits and petroglyphs are close to the highway, there are no signs or markers to identify the historic district. This helps to protect the fragile archeological sites within the district.

In late 2017, Davie proposed extending the project through the conversion of a second ship to ensure full capability for both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.  Background  , one of the previous s The Royal Canadian Navy intended to replace its aging s with new Joint Support Ships in 2008. However that program was cancelled shortly before the 2008 federal election by the Conservatives after those bids that were entered by interested shipyards came in too high. The program to replace the Protecteur class was revived as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. The new s were intended to enter service in 2020. was intended to be in service until 2017 and until 2016, however a catastrophic fire aboard Protecteur in 2014 led to her early decommissioning and an engineering survey discovered high levels of corrosion in Preserver that led to her being kept alongside in Halifax. This left a significant operational gap for the RCN. The Navy set about trying to fill the gap, renting the replenishment services of other navies, specifically the Chilean on the Pacific coast and for the Atlantic coast, inquiring into renting a ship from Spain. In 2014 Chantier Davie pitched an unsolicited plan for an interim supply ship to the Conservative government. Following that, Seaspan and Irving Shipbuilding also submitted proposals that were ultimately unsuccessful. Chantier Davie's plan was chosen and the Conservative government began exploring their proposal.  Awarding of contract  In June 2015, the Conservative government changed a line in contracting regulations that govern Cabinet spending that allowed them to award a sole-sourced contract when operationally necessary and fulfills an interim need. It was announced shortly thereafter that the government had entered into discussions with Chantier Davie Canada on whether it could provide an interim supply ship until the new Protecteur-class vessels were ready. This led the Conservative government signing a letter of intent with Chantier Davie to explore a plan to convert a civilian cargo ship into an interim auxiliary vessel. A second converted ship was offered to the RCN, but was declined. Chantier Davie moved ahead with the project, purchasing the container ship from Capital Ship Management of Greece for a reported $20 million. Initially the plan was for the ship to be brought to the Aecon Yard in Pictou, and then completed at Davie's yard in Quebec. However, Asterix instead went directly to Davie's yard at L√©vis, Quebec, arriving in October. On 10 August 2015, Chantier Davie signed an agreement for work on the conversion with Hepburn Engineering of Ontario who specializes in maritime underway replenishment equipment. In September, it was announced that L-3 MAPPS (a subsidiary of L-3 Communications), was selected as partner in the conversion for its Integrated Platform Management System. It is also planned to re-utilise the resupply equipment from Protecteur by installing it aboard Asterix. OSI Maritime Systems was chosen by Davie Shipyards to install their integrated navigation and tactical system aboard the converted ship. In October 2015, the Conservative government finalized that plan, which would cost $700 million over seven years including $300 million for the conversion itself, but left final authorization until after the election. The RCN also would have the option of buying the ship after completion.  Delay and completion  In November 2015, following the reception of a letter from James D. Irving, co-chief executive officer of Irving Shipbuilding, the Liberal Trudeau government postponed the final authorization of the project for two months. This decision provoked a response from Philippe Couillard, Premier of Quebec, the location of the Davie shipyard. Couillard stated that he would not accept Ottawa halting or any alterations to the project going forward. Other political leaders within Quebec were equally vocal against any changes. Should the contract not be signed, the Government of Canada is obliged to pay Chantier Davie $89 million according to the Letter of Intent signed earlier in the year. On 30 November 2015, the Liberal government gave final approval for the project, allowing the conversion to go ahead. , the conversion was ahead of schedule. with 60% of the conversion completed. The ship was planned to be available for sea trials in September 2017. On 20 July 2017 Davie Shipbuilding unveiled Asterix in a public ceremony with the traditional breaking of a bottle of champagne. This honour was performed by Pauline Th√©berge, spouse of J. Michel Doyon, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. The vessel was re-launched on 15 October 2017 at Quebec City. Sea trials were scheduled to begin on 16 November in Gasp√© Bay. The ship was accepted by the Royal Canadian Navy on 6 March 2018 at Halifax, Nova Scotia. A second ship, to be named Obelix was offered to the Canadian government but the offer was refused in December 2017. The government claimed that the Canadian military had performed an assessment and found no need for a second supply ship. Federal Fleet Services attempted to sell the government the second ship again in December 2018, this time at a reduced price of $500 million.  Conversion features  A Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone Asterix is used for at sea fuel replenishing for both liquid and solids using NATO-standardised methods and two cranes for loading and unloading purposes. The ship is able to deliver 400 tons of fresh water per day and carry 7,000 tons of fuel oil. The vessel has a container bay for protection of the containers while in transit. The ship has a double hull, a feature that the previous Protecteur class did not have and prevented them from operating outside of international waters. For mission purposes the ship has rooms for crew and medical/hospital facilities for humanitarian missions, along with humanitarian and disaster relief capabilities. There is an area to treat and process evacuees and survivors, a large medical ward divided into two areas capable of treating up to 60. The ship also provides room for 350 in emergency situations. Asterix, post-conversion, is able to operate up to eight smaller boats with quick launch and recovery capability. Asterix has two aircraft hangars capable of embarking two CH-148 Cyclones, and a landing deck capable of handling some of the largest helicopters, including the CH-147F Chinook.  Other bids  Two other Canadian shipbuilders submitted proposals to the government to convert a civilian cargo vessel into a naval replenishment vessel. Both proposals, one by Irving Shipbuilding, the other by Seaspan, were initially rejected at the time by the Conservative government. Irving Shipbuilding sent a letter to the new Trudeau government, asking them to review the project, stating that they could provide a cheaper option than what Davie proposed. Irving criticised the Davie plan, claiming that a container ship is \\"wrong\\" and that it would require \\"too much conversion...too risky, too expensive and doesn't provide the large interior payload.\\" Irving instead submitted a design based on a roll-on/roll-off vessel that \\"would be capable of refueling two ships simultaneously, as well as landing helicopters and allowing large trucks and emergency response vehicles to drive on and off.\\" Seaspan's Victoria Shipyards reaffirmed their proposal in November, claiming to do it at a lower cost than that provided by Davie Shipyards. They presented two options to the government, one a \\"fuel supply only and another for a supply and support option.\\" Federal Fleet and Chantier Davie have begun campaigning for the construction of additional Resolve-class auxiliary oiler replenishment (AOR) ships. Davie notes that the Resolve class has performance and capability characteristics that match or exceed the characteristics of the Joint Support Ships (Protecteur class) for only 25% the cost of one of the Joint Support Ships. Davie Shipbuilding's actual cost for the Resolve-class AOR is less than $500 million per ship, compared to the Joint Support Ships' cost estimate of $2 billion per ship.

He and Miladin Popoviƒá were the Yugoslav delegates that helped unite the Albanian communist groups in 1941. The two had been sent to Albania on the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CK KPJ), chosen for their revolutionary experience and political knowledge, to be available to the Albanian communists; they were the most active regarding Yugoslav‚ÄìAlbanian alliance.

After having persuaded the disunited Albanian communists to pursue a common fight for \\"liberation from capitalistic exploitations and Imperial slavery\\", the work culminated in the meeting of 8 November 1941, with over twenty representatives, that ended in the official establishment of the Albanian Communist Party. While in Tirana, after the freeing of Popoviƒá, Krsto Filipoviƒá and others from prison camps, the OK KPJ Kosmet decided that Mugo≈°a and Popoviƒá stay in Albania. Boro Vukmiroviƒá requested that Mugo≈°a be returned to Kosovo. On 25 May 1942, Mugo≈°a began his trip crossing Montenegro, joining up with Todor Vojvodiƒá and Spasoje ƒêakoviƒá in Andrijevica. As the secretary of OK KPJ of Kosmet, he announced the annexation of Kosovo and Metohija to Serbia. He left Albania on 12 April 1944. The three most influential in the decision of uniting Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija to NR Serbia were Jovan Veselinov, Du≈°an Mugo≈°a, and Mehmed Hoxha, who represented the provinces on the extraordinary session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the National Liberation of Serbia on 6 April 1945.

He was one of the organizers of the partisan fighting in Kosovo. He was posthumously given the Hero of Yugoslavia award. Life An active communist in Kosovo, he was arrested on 18 July 1941 near Ro≈æaje, and sent to a concentration camp near Peqin in Albania. He managed to escape with the support of the Albanian communists a few months later. He and Du≈°an Mugo≈°a were the Yugoslav delegates that in 1941 helped the Albanian communist groups unite and create the Communist Party of Albania.

Mugo≈°a and Popoviƒá were members of the Regional Committee KPJ (OK KPJ) of Kosmet (Kosovo). Popoviƒá left Albania in September 1944. He was killed on 13 March 1945 in Pristina by two Kosovar Albanians, Haki Taha and Qazim Vula, both members of the anticommunist Albanian National Democratic Movement. Taha killed himself right after murdering Popoviƒá, whereas Vula was arrested and given a life sentence, but managed to escape from the prison of Ni≈°, and fled to Albania, where he was again arrested. Vula died in 1987. Sources disagree about the motives of Taha and Vula: while the Yugoslavian regime said that the two killers were motivated by anti-Serbian sentiments, communist Albania's version was that they were used as kamikaze by the Yugoslav secret police (UDBA), who wanted to eliminate Popoviƒá for his pro-Albanian sentiments. Inside the CPA and the CPY relationship, Popoviƒá always took a pro- Internationalism and pro-Albanian stance. In a party meeting of 1946 in Mitrovica, Kosovo, as a delegate of the Central Committee, he stated: \\"Albanians during the old Yugoslavia were oppressed, robbed economically, spiritually negated or even physically exterminated, and [you] don't need to wonder why they had eagerly welcomed the Germans, as they were for them the liberators from the former government\\". The Albanian side vaguely supported the Yugoslav version at the time regarding his assassination, but after the Yugoslav-Albanian split in 1948 they accused the OZNA of having set it all up.
