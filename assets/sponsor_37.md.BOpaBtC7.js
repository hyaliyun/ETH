Waight, served from 1969 until 1986. He was born in Belize City and was the Surveyor General of Belize. His dedication to the Belize Audubon Society is honored by an annual award for services to conservation in Belize called the James A. Waight Award. The Belize Audubon Society aims at conserving and protecting wildlife in Belize for the benefit of humanity and the earth's biological diversity. In 1973 the society's first launched conservation project, the Jabiru Stork, was added to Belize's list of protected species. Board of directors The responsibilities of the Board of Directors of the Belize Audubon Society include policy setting, fiscal guidance, and governance of the society.

History  North Red Deer was established as a hamlet in 1894 upon completion of the C&E; rail line, including the bridge over the Red Deer River. It incorporated as the Village of North Red Deer on February 17, 1911, with the ministerial order being signed on June 18, 1911. Walter Webb became the village's first mayor on March 13, 1911. After a previously unratified attempt in 1946, the Village of North Red Deer amalgamated with the City of Red Deer on January 1, 1948. The last village council meeting occurred on December 24, 1947. Over the course of its incorporation, North Red Deer grew from a population of 304 in 1911 to a population of 698 in 1946. In 1999, the City of Red Deer renamed the area of the former village to Riverside Meadows. In 2000, the city adopted the Riverside Meadows Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP), which was replaced by a new ARP in 2009.

The village is only accessible by motor vehicles over a secondary road from Rothes√ºtte or from the B 81 federal road between Hasselfelde and Ilfeld. In addition, several walking trails run from surrounding villages to Sophienhof. Sophienhof has a halt on the Harz Railway, which is located in the forest to the west outside the village. There is also a Harzer Wandernadel hiking checkpoint (no. 97) in the village by the Ziegenalm cafe.  History  The village was probably established in the 17th century from a collection of foresters' huts and was first mentioned in 1645 (under another name). In 1710, Count Christian Ernest of Stolberg-Wernigerode inherited the County of Wernigerode and Hohnstein Forest. In 1712, he married Sophie Charlotte Countess zu Leiningen-Westerburg, after whom the village was renamed in 1720, having previously been called Schmerplatz. After a preaching sites had been established in 1734 in Rothes√ºtte and Sophienhof, a small church was built in Sophienhof which, like the church in neighbouring Rothes√ºtte fell into ruins due to its proximity to the Inner German Border and was torn down in the 1960s. Its bell, cast in 1742, has survived and is located in a bell cradle on the cemetery. In 1747, Hans Dietrich von Zanthier was appointed as the comital Master Forester and Master Hunter with his work residence in Sophienhof. He is commemorated by a memorial rock. Sophienhof was incorporated in 1972 into the municipality of Ilfeld. Since 1 January 2012, Ilfeld has been part of the newly formed Harztor municipality.

History  Arrival of a steam loco at the station Schierke Station The station, which is located at a height of 687 metres above sea level, was opened on 20 June 1898 and has been in continuous use as a railway station ever since. On the completion of the line up to the Brocken on 4 October 1898, trains to the highest mountain in North Germany, which were predominantly used by tourists, called at Schierke station. Because Brocken station was not served in winter due to heavy snowfalls, trains always terminated in Schierke from 16 October to 29 April. Not until the German Winter Sports Championships in spring 1950 did trains run to the Brocken in winter as well.

The solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, which is stored in the batteries and can be used to power portable electronic appliances like mobile phones and mp3 players.  Features  The solar backpack usually contains a flexible monocrystalline solar panel, battery, charge controller, plugs, cords and light bulbs. It provides users with power up to 120 watt-hours/day, capable of powering electronic equipment rated up to 300 W. It can also be utilized in international aid, disaster relief, emergency power and field research.  Applications  Solar backpack * A solar backpack system known as Rucksack Enhanced Portable Power System (REPPS), developed by the United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, features a 62-watt solar panel blanket in a backpack for use by the US army based in Afghanistan. The US Air Force had previously employed solar panels on shipping containers, developed by Lockheed Martin, while the Marines developed suitcase units of foldable solar panels which can also be carried as a backpack. As military equipment like radios and GPS units require much energy, these portable solar power systems were designed to minimize dependence of troops on fossil fuels in combat zones. The REPPS is currently utilized by the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team in Logar, Afghanistan. It is used to power electronic devices with a charging time of just six hours. As it weighs at around ten pounds, it can be carried as a backpack easily.

About  Rift Valley Resources, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Rift Valley Resources (Tanzania) Limited, focuses on acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral deposits. It holds interests in 9 granted licenses and 7 licenses under application covering a total of approximately 1,183 square kilometers within geological provinces of Tanzania containing known deposits of gold, nickel, copper, and platinum group elements. The company was incorporated in 2010 and is based in Perth, Australia.  Projects  Rift Valley Resources Ltd (RVR) holds interests within geological provinces of known gold, and nickel, copper, and platinum group element (PGE) endowment in Tanzania. These properties have potential for the discovery of commercial minerals; principally gold and nickel, in a number of geologic settings.  Gold Overview  The Nyanzian Supergroup rocks host the majority of known gold deposits in Tanzania and contain most of the greenstone belts found in the Tanzanian Craton. Granite rocks surrounding these greenstone belts are also known to host gold mineralisation and previous exploration and mining has been centred on these rocks. The Tanzanian Craton has many similarities to other globally-significant gold-producing cratons such as the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia, the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Cratons in Southern Africa, and the Superior Craton of the Canadian Shield. RVR's gold projects are located within three geological regions which contain both greenstone and granite rocks. The first region is termed the ‚ÄúLake Victoria domain‚Äù. It comprises the granite-greenstone belts immediately to the south of Lake Victoria. The second is termed the ‚Äúnorthern domain‚Äù. It comprises the granite-greenstone belts to the east of Lake Victoria and north of the town of Mwanza. The third gold region is termed the ‚ÄúSouthern domain‚Äù and is located over granite terrane south of the Kahama District. Lake Victoria Domain  Kasubuya Project  The Kasubuya tenement is located within the central Lake Victorian goldfields region of Tanzania some 45 km EW of the Geita town site. It extends 3.7 km to the east and 7 km to the south for a total area of about 26 km¬≤. The Kasubuya Project is hosted dominantly within granite directly south of the regionally and historically significant gold producing greenstone belt of the Geita goldfield south of Lake Victoria. The property is located at the eastern end of the Geita greenstone where it starts to trend to the south and then southeast due to doming of the greenstone sequence over the granitic intrusive. The most northeastern tip of the Kasubuya license encompasses some Upper Nyanzian Formation comprising well-exposed banded iron formation and felsic tuffs and poorly-exposed pillowed tholeiitic basalt lava and mafic tuffs typical of the Geita greenstone belt.  Chibango Project  The Chibango tenement is located within the central Lake Victorian goldfields region of Tanzania 10 km SW of the Geita town site and 6 km south of the Ridge 8 or Nyamulilima Hill gold deposit owned by AngloGold Ashanti. Access is via a sealed road that runs WSW from the town of Geita and crosses the extreme NW corner of the property at a distance of about 25 km. Topography is very hilly with thick native forests covering much of the property. The Chibango Project is hosted wholly within granite directly south of the regionally- and historically-significant gold- producing greenstone belt of the Geita goldfield south of Lake Victoria. Despite strong topography, actual outcropping granite is rare and largely obscured by the dense vegetation. Significant fracturing consistent with regional structures known to control the mineralisation at Geita and other prospects of the greenstone belt can be identified from the interpretation of regional aerial magnetic images.  Northern Domain   Nyasiri Project  The Nyasiri tenement is located in northeast Tanzania within the historically productive Mara-Musoma Goldfield some 20 km SE of North Mara (Nyabirama) mine owned by Barrick Gold. The area is accessible by Tarime airstrip then a rough road going towards the Serengeti District; the tenement straddles the western border of the Serengeti National Park. The Nyasiri Project is hosted dominantly within granite that contains two small inliers of greenstone rocks (1 to 2 km and 2 to 3 km in area) presumably of Nyanzian origin. The western quarter of the property is covered with Bukoban Proterozoic-age sediments which unconformably overlie the Archean granite/greenstone beneath. Intrusive Proterozoic-age ultrabasic rocks occur along the southern margin of the property. Their sub-surface distribution is likely to be extensive as a gravity anomaly associated with the ultrabasic lopolith intrusion covers a large portion of the Nyasiri property. The Keserya Hills Cr-Ni-PGE prospect occurs immediately south of the Nyasiri property and the ultramafic rocks which host this prospect trend into the Nyasiri tenement. These ultramafic rocks are considered prospective for massive or disseminated Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralisation or strataform Ni-Cr-PGE mineralisation.  Buhemba South East Project  The Buhemba South tenement is located in north east Tanzania within the historically productive Mara-Musoma Goldfield some 9 km due southeast of its namesake township, . Access is to the Sarama property along a local inter-village vehicular track. There is a track leading more directly to the town of Buhemba but it is in poor repair and difficult to follow. Local access on the property is generally poor and via village tracks and trails. The tenement straddles the contact between granites and greenstone belt of the Mara-Musoma goldfield. Approximately two-thirds of the tenement is underlain by granitic rock types while the north western third comprises sub- cropping volcanics of mainly mafic to intermediate composition of the Nyanzian System. Twof granite occur in the southern third of the property but most of the granite is covered by extensive mbugu plains. The volcanic rocks outcrop as a NE-SW trending range of hills and about half of the 4 km of strike length is exposed within the property boundary. Structural interpretation of the magnetic and gravity geophysical data also confirms the location and strike of the Nyanzian System rocks. \\\\-  Sarama Project  The Sarama tenement is located in north east Tanzania within the Mara-Musoma Goldfield, 10 km due south of the township of Buhemba and 20 km east of the Suguti Project. Access is via the sealed Mwanza to Musoma highway up to the small township of Butiama, then via graded roads to the township of Buhemba and on to Sarama village located close to the northern boundary of the property. Internal access is good as the land is relatively flat with drainage typically towards the south. Sarama extends approximately 4.5 km to the east and 4 km to the south for a total area of about 18 km¬≤. The tenement straddles the southern boundary of the Mara-Musoma greenstone belt with granites but the geology is largely covered by thin soils overlying sub-cropping residual laterites. The greenstones are most likely part of the Nyanzian System and the southern portion of the tenement is covered extensively by mbugu soils which are interpreted to overlie granite. At least 4 km of ESE striking granite- greenstone contact has been identified from reconnaissance mapping. Structural interpretation of the magnetic and gravity geophysical data indicates a series of easterly trending structures parallel the main contact into the greenstone sequences. Mapping of artisanal workings within the northwest quadrant of the tenement identified a quartz vein up to 1m wide within an easterly striking shear zone dipping to the north at 40¬∞. The vein is hosted by sheared mafic volcanics and had been excavated over an estimated distance of 100m.  Suguti Project  The Suguti tenement application is located in northeast Tanzania within the historically productive Mara-Musoma Goldfield 40 km south of the township of Musoma and 25 km west southwest from the township of Buhemba. Access is gained from the sealed Mwanza to Musoma highway which passes through the western edge of the property. Internal access to the project is good with a graded access road traversing the property from east to west. The southern portion of the property is mostly soil-covered cultivated- ground that drains to the southwest into the Suguti River and then into Lake Victoria. The northern half of the property comprises steep hills and ranges with moderate to strong rock outcrop and has very little human habitation or cultivation. General land use is seasonal crop farming and no landholder access issues have been identified that will prevent exploration activities. The prospecting license extends approximately 9.3 km to the east and 8.3 km to the south for a total area of about 77 km¬≤. The Suguti property is located within the prospective greenstone belt of the Mara‚ÄìMusoma goldfield. The outcropping geology comprises an area of mafic to intermediate volcanics that form a large easterly trending range of hills in the northern portion of the property. This range is dominated by a prominent and strongly magnetic BIF extending for at least 8 km across the property. Smaller BIF units occur elsewhere within the volcanic succession and these are typically 5 to 10m wide representing thin interflow sediments to the volcanics. The greenstones are most likely part of the Upper Nyanzian System. The south west corner of the project is covered by mbugu clays which have filled a topographic depression formed by the regionally significant northwest-trending Suguti shear. The primary shear extends in excess of 50 km and has displacements of several kilometres interpreted from the geology either side of the fault contact. The shear is also readily identified from the aerial magnetic data as zones of demagnetisation. A secondary cross cutting northeast trending fault terminates the eastern end of the prominent BIF horizon. This 0600 orientation is an important control on mineralisation which is known to host gold resources elsewhere in the Mara-Musoma goldfield.  Nickel Overview  Rocks of the Karagwe‚ÄìAnkolean Supergroup host most of the known nickel, copper, PGE, and tin mineralisation in Tanzania. This Supergroup forms part of the north trending Kibaran Fold Belt that extends from Zambia, through the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and NW Tanzania, into Uganda and to the west of Lake Victoria. Rift Valley has secured properties along the fold belt. The properties have received very little known modern exploration but have the key components needed to host accumulations of magmatic nickel sulfides such as for the Kabanga-style mineralisation. The targets are typically greenfields and highly conceptual in nature but are well-founded on the concepts and nickel mineralisation models which have evolved over the past 40 years of exploration in Tanzania. These mobile belts are increasingly recognized for their potential to host significant nickel, copper and platinum group element (Ni-Cu-PGE) deposits like the Kabanga Deposit and the Kagera prospect, which are situated near the border with Burundi.

Early life Richard Craig was the son of William Craig (1772‚Äì1828) and was born in Ireland. When he was aged eight his father was sentenced to seven years transportation. Although contrary to the rules governing convict transportation, Richard sailed with his father to New South Wales as a free person. He arrived in Sydney, aged nine, on 9 January 1821, on the Prince Regent. In 1825, William Craig was convicted of cattle stealing and was sentenced to serve three years in the penal settlement of Port Macquarie, about north of Sydney. During this time, Richard came to know the surrounding countryside, made friends with the Aborigines and learned their language. Conviction Richard and his father were carrying on the trade of butchers in Sydney on 2 July 1828 when both were charged with stealing five head of cattle from a herd at Richmond. On 15 September 1828, William was sentenced to 14 years on Norfolk Island and Richard, at the age of 16, was sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to seven years hard labour in chains at Moreton Bay under Captain Patrick Logan, where he arrived on 24 January 1829, one of 137 felons aboard the Edinburgh. Escape He escaped and was recaptured twice in 1829, being absent for 12 days in March and again from 20 September to 10 November. He again escaped on 17 December 1830, and made an astonishing journey south through the bush to what is now the Queensland‚ÄìNew South Wales border, and then through the New England area towards Port Macquarie. He spent almost 12 months living with Aborigines around the Clarence River, where he became familiar with the country and rivers. Gradually he moved south and arrived at Port Macquarie in late November 1831. Upon arrival, he gave an account of the rivers and rich grazing flats in northern New South Wales and also the sighting of escaped cattle. As reward for this information, he was allowed to remain at Port Macquarie instead of being returned to Moreton Bay and was allowed to go into private service. Freedom By 1836 he had been pardoned and was living and working as a free man. He travelled to Maclean (on the Clarence River) to cut cedar and for many years made a good living as a guide in the Clarence River area, travelling and blazing trails through previously inaccessible country. In what may have been his first job as a guide, he was employed by a Thomas Small of Sydney who, inspired by Craig's reports, sent on 5 May 1838 his brother and two dozen sawyers on board the schooner Susan to the \\"Big River\\" (4.9 MB) (later named the Clarence by Governor Gipps). It was the first European vessel to enter the river. During his 12-month journey from Moreton Bay to Port Macquarie in 1831 Craig had explored the upper reaches of the Clarence River, including the western section of what was then known as Guy Fawkes Plateau (now Dorrigo Plateau). After he was pardoned he returned and used his unique knowledge of the area to blaze a trail from Guy Fawkes (Ebor) to The Settlement (South Grafton). This track was known as Craig's Line and pioneered the traffic link between Grafton and Armidale, allowing the movement of large parties of new settlers from the New England Tableland into the Clarence Valley. In 1843 he was superintendent of a property, Eatonsville (on the Clarence River) but by 1855 was again a butcher. He married Anne Baker and had six sons and one daughter. He died on 14 July 1855 in Grafton from complications arising from a fall from a horse.

Anthropologist Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala says the myth is a potential factor in infant rape by HIV-positive men in South Africa. In addition to young girls, who are presumed to be virgins because of their age, people who are \\"blind, deaf, physically impaired, intellectually disabled, or who have mental-health disabilities\\" are sometimes raped under the erroneous presumption that individuals with disabilities are sexually inactive and therefore virgins. History The myth was first reported in 16th-century Europe and gained prominence in 19th-century Victorian England as a cure for syphilis and gonorrhea among other sexually transmitted diseases. The origin is unknown, but historian Hanne Blank writes that the idea may have evolved from Christian legends of virgin‚Äìmartyrs, whose purity served as a form of protection in battling demons.  Prevalence  People all over the world have heard this myth, including in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. A survey by the University of South Africa (UNISA) in South Africa found that 18 percent of laborers thought that having sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS. An earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in Gauteng reported that 32 percent of the survey participants believed the myth. According to Betty Makoni of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, the myth is perpetuated by traditional healers advising HIV-positive men to cure their disease by having sex with virgin girls. In Zimbabwe, some people also believe that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the infected person's blood of the disease. In 2002, psychologist Mike Earl-Taylor wrote that the virgin cure myth may explain the staggering rise in child or infant rapes in South Africa, which is facing an HIV/AIDS epidemic. UNICEF has attributed the rape of hundreds of girls to the virgin cleansing myth. However, it is unknown exactly how common the myth is and to what degree rapes happen because of the belief in it. The claim that the myth drives either HIV infection or child sexual abuse in Africa is disputed by researchers Rachel Jewkes and Helen Epstein, \\"In the current South African case, this claim is predicated on racist assumptions about the amorality of African men...\\" as well as by research on convicted sex offenders in Malawi, where no evidence was found to support the idea that the virgin cleansing myth prompted any rapes. Importance of education Ignorance with regards to HIV and AIDS infection serves as a barrier to prevention in numerous African nations. Education has helped women such as Betty Makoni speak out against the myth and attempt to dissuade people from believing the virgin cleansing myth. According to UNICEF, culture-based gender roles that prize innocence and ignorance in girls and that accept sexual licentiousness in men promote this myth. Girls may be forced to marry older men, which can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission to girls. The stigma attached to AIDS also stops many people from seeking information or health services to shield their status, contributing to further transmission. In popular culture The virgin cleansing myth is referenced in the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon. The minor character Mattumbo is stopped from raping a baby based on the belief that sex with a virgin will cure his AIDS. During the song \\"Making Things Up Again\\", Elder Cunningham tells Mattumbo that raping babies is against God's will, and invents a passage in the Book of Mormon in which God tells Joseph Smith to instead have sex with a frog to cure his AIDS.

JG 302 was formed on 1 November 1943 in Stade, Germany with a theoretical establishment of Stab and three Gruppen (groups) known as a \\"Wilde Sau\\" (wild boar) single-seat night fighter unit. After re-equipping with the Focke-Wulf 190 A-8, I./JG 302 was redesignated III./JG 301 on 30 September. JG 302 made a known total of at least 348 air victory claimshttp://www.military- art.com/mall/squadroninfo.php?SquadronID=256  Operations 1944  The unit's primary mission, when formed in late 1943, was to intercept Royal Air Force (RAF) heavy bombers at night, flying modified single-engined day fighters. Eventually JG 302 also engaged United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers by day. Initially, the pilots recruited were a mix of former bomber pilots and instructors, experienced in night and instrument flying. During the night of 22 November, Hauptmann Heinrich Wurzer (26 victories, 24 by day, all with JG 302) shot down a RAF Lancaster bomber for his first victory and on 14 January 1944 was appointed Staffelkapit√§n of 1./JG 302. On 6/7 February 1944 the Soviet Long-Range Bomber Force (ADD) launched a series of large scale air raids against Helsinki. Thus, early in 1944 elements of I./JG 302 were temporarily transferred North to Nachtjagd-Kommando Helsinki to assist in the city's defence. On 12 February 1944, 12 Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6/R6 night- fighters of I. Gruppe arrived at Malmi airfield from J√ºterbog in Germany. Using the \\"Wilde Sau\\" method, I./JG 302 shot down two Soviet aircraft on 16/17 February. On 26/27 February the unit shot down another four bombers. In April 1944 I./JG 302 lost three planes in flying accidents and had had just seven fighters operational. The unit returned to Germany for Reich defence duties on 15 May 1944. On 16 April 18 Bf 109G-6s of I gruppe intercepted USAAF bombers over Plattensee. Some six bombers, two P-51s and a P-38 were claimed for three JG 302 fighters downed. On 2 July I./ JG 302, led by Hptm. Richard Lewens, attacked 603 B-24 Liberators of the 15th Air Force, attacking targets near Budapest; they were escorted by 270 fighters. Combats ranged from Budapest into Southern Slovakia. I./ JG 302 claimed 19 B-24s and two P-51s, but lost 12 Bf 109s and 10 crewmen killed in the battle. Unteroffizier Willi Reschke was JG 302's most prolific ace, scoring 14 of his eventual 26 combat claims with JG 302. He achieved his first success when he shot down two B-24s over Budapest on 2 July. Reschke rammed a B-24 on 7 July when his guns malfunctioned, successfully baling out of his stricken fighter. On 8 July 1944 I./JG 302 took off from G√∂tzendorf under Hpt. Heinrich W√ºrzer to intercept 15th Air Force heavy bombers over Bratislava and Vienna. The unit claimed nine B-24s and three B-17s, with I./ JG 302 losing one pilot killed and four wounded. On this day Hpt. Wurzer shot down two B-24s. However, he was wounded in the right arm during this combat and had to make an emergency landing with his Bf 109 G-6 near the G√∂tzendorft airfield. On 25 July 1944 420 B-17s and B-24s bombed the tank factories in Linz while other bombers hit the Villach marshalling yards. Nearly 200 Luftwaffe fighters opposed the attacks, drawn from II./ JG 27, Stab, I. and II./JG 300 and I./ JG 302. 16 bombers were downed, while the USAAF bombers and escort fighters claimed over 60 fighters shot down. I./ JG 302 lost four killed, two wounded, and 12 planes lost for six bombers claimed destroyed. On 24 August, Reschke claimed a further B-24 but shortly afterwards, during an attack on a second, his aircraft was hit by return fire, and he baled out when P-51 fighters attacked his Bf 109. Hpt. Wurzer was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 302 on 28 August 1944. In September I./JG 302 was reformed as III./JG 301 and re-equipped with the Fw 190 A-8. A new commander, Ritterkreuz holder Hpt.

History  SPSTL (firstly State Scientific Library (SSL) of the Presidium of Highest Council of national economy, Moscow) was established in 1918. Its first directors and organizers were L.A. Schlossberg, A.I. Yakovlev, D.I. Ulyanov. In 1927 SSL became the Central Library for Industry. In 1946 according to the Government decision the Library was transferred to the Ministry of Higher Education of USSR for servicing research workers and engineers, working in different ministries, institutions and enterprises of the country. In 1948 the Library got the right to get free obligatory copy of all printed production of USSR from the All-Union Book Chamber.  SPSTL as part of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR  In 1958 according to the order of the USSR Soviet of Ministers the Library was transferred to the just formed Siberian Branch of the Academy of Science of the USSR and received its current name.  Building construction  The construction of the Library building began in 1961. The project was designed by the group of architects ‚Äì A. A. Volovik, E.V. Amosov and the consultant architect from Moscow F.N. Paschenko. The building got the form of monolithic block with the symmetric decision of its fa√ßade.

In between, the Lateral Road runs directly through Wangdue Phodrang, Trongsa, and other population centers. The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital Thimphu and other major population centers such as Paro and Punakha. The Lateral Road traverses are a number of high passes, including Tremo La and Dochu La. The highest pass on the road is at Chele La; the second-highest pass is at Trumshing La in central Bhutan at an altitude of over . The Lateral Road and society The works that formed the Lateral Road, among other development projects, were fruits of mostly Indian and Nepali laborers. Their contributions were necessary to bolster Bhutanese national security and to connect populations. As the Lateral Road has led to increased infrastructure development, it has added to a sense of national unity, connecting various pockets of ethnic groups. Most freight in Bhutan is moved along the highway on eight-ton Tata trucks, which are often overloaded and which stress road conditions. There is a network of passenger buses, and the most common vehicle in government and private use is the four-wheel-drive pickup. Road safety Road construction in Bhutan Because much of the geology is unstable, there are frequent slips and landslides, which are aggravated by both summer monsoon and winter snowstorm and frost heave conditions. Teams of Indian labourers are housed at work camps in the mountain passes to be dispatched to clear the roads in the event of road blockage. The conditions in the work camps are poor, with the workers reduced to breaking rock into gravel on a piece-rate basis when not clearing the roads. An international aid project is under way to stabilise the worst sections of the road. A major Japanese aid project seeks to replace most of the narrow single track bridges with two-way girder spans capable of carrying heavier traffic. There are no stoplights. Mountain passes are often closed during winter due to heavy snowfall, shutting off land communication along the Lateral Road. During road closures, commercial and public vehicles are prohibited from attempting passes such as Thrumshing La, however private vehicles may proceed at their own risk. Blockages at high altitudes must be cleared by both heavy equipment and manual labour. At times, clearing crews have considerable difficulty even reaching the pass. Along the Lateral Road, there are many sheer drops of thousands of feet at the roadside, notably around Thrumshing La. Because of the many hazards and frequently dangerous conditions, the Government of Bhutan has approved and begun constructing a bypass to the Lateral Road around Thrumshing La as part of its Tenth Five Year Plan. The bypass will cut travel time, distance, and danger by avoiding Thrumshing La. The new route is expected to shorten travel time between Shingkhar village (Ura Gewog, Bumthang) and Gorgan (Menbi Gewog, Lhuntse) by 100 km and 3 hours. The new road construction met with fierce opposition by environmentalists; the government has chosen to proceed with construction nonetheless.

Joseph Boyd, OMI. Hence, in July 1941, Notre Dame Academy, now known as Notre Dame of Midsayap College, in Midsayap opened its doors. It was the first Notre Dame school, which grew to over 190 and form the Notre Dame Educational Association.http://www.ndmc.edu.ph/index.php/about/61-history-of-notre-dame- of-midsayap-college After the war, communities of migrants from elsewhere in the Philippines, mainly the Ilocos region and the Visayan islands, settled in various parts of the empire province. The national government then was only able to provide elementary education opportunities for such communities, but the migrants saw the need for more schooling for their young ones beyond the elementary level. The Oblate Fathers and the other religious congregations, who came to the empire province to minister mainly to the spiritual needs of the migrants who were mostly Catholic, responded by opening secondary schools and, where feasible, colleges in these communities. This was also done in the Sulu Archipelago as the native populace began to realize the value of formal education. In all instances, the name given to the schools so founded was also Notre Dame. Further emphasizing this early spirit of oneness was the use of a common school uniform for the students and the same school hymn. Thus begun the commitment to serve the educational needs of the region and its younger educational needs of the region and its younger generations under the banner and inspiration of Notre Dame. In the 1950s they worked together to hold annual athletic competitions, the Notre Dame Meets, which was at that time one of the biggest event in the region. In 1962 the Superintendent of Catholic schools in the diocese (which then included both the empire province of Cotabato and the Sulu archipelago) directed the heads of the various Notre Dame schools to have a series of meetings to discuss common needs and problems and ways in which they can cooperatively meet these.http://ndeacot.org/ The most popular Notre Dame schools are Notre Dame of Dadiangas University, Notre Dame of Marbel University, Notre Dame University and Notre Dame of Greater Manila.

It caused 19 deaths and an unknown number of injuries. Earthquake The main shock came a few hours before dawn, at 4.10 a.m. with its epicenter on the Cansiglio plateau, near the towns of Fiaschetti, Steven√† and Villa di Villa. It was preceded a few hours earlier by a small foreshock. The earthquake was moderate in magnitude (5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale) but was rated as IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The towns near the epicenter received extensive damage, most of their buildings were made uninhabitable or destroyed. The Cansiglio plateau is an agricultural high plain, where buildings were mostly made of poor materials using traditional construction techniques. The earthquake was felt in the whole of northern and central Italy, as well as in Slovenia, Austria and Switzerland. While some sources report no casualties, other official sources list 19 dead.IISEE website Aftershocks came frequently for a few days, and lasted until March 1937. The hypocenter was estimated as 15‚Äì18 km, much shallower than the 37‚Äì51 km range for other earthquakes in the area. The estimate is disputed, and a revised estimate of 43 km was calculated in 1946 using a macroseismic approach. Later studies have generally supported the initial depth estimate. The region north of Cansiglio, called Conca d'Alpago, also experienced severe damage. Fifty to seventy percent of the buildings in the towns of Puos d'Alpago and Cornei received critical damage and became unfit for use. The quake caused damage in Sacile, Vittorio Veneto and in the valleys of Livenza and Meschio rivers, with most of the residential buildings receiving some degree of damage. Belluno, Conegliano and San Vito al Tagliamento, along with other 40 minor towns, reported some damage and a few collapsed buildings. The cities of Bolzano and Venice showed minor affects, mostly collapsed plaster and chimneys. In Vittorio Veneto the Ceneda district was badly hit, four building collapsed, 40 critically damaged and over 300 in need of restoration works. The Seminary received so much damage it had to be partially demolished. Severe damage was sustained by many public buildings, including the Cathedral, the Carabinieri headquarter, the Tax Office and the town hall. Total damage was assessed at 4 million lire. Due to the high damage sustained, Vittorio Veneto was later added, along with some nearby comuni to the list of town subject to seismic risk. The rebuilding, overseen by the city prefect Aldo Marinotti, was slow, and took over two years to start. Previous events On June 29, 1873 an earthquake struck the area, its epicenter on the Alpago basin, damaging many towns and cities including Belluno and its province, where 40 people died. 54 other casualties were reported, including 38 people killed by the collapse of a church in San Pietro di Feletto during the morning mass.

Life He was born in Peterborough of Roman Catholic parents, and studied art in London as a pupil of the Genoese refugee Alessandro Maria Grimaldi (1659‚àí1732). He painted portraits of his master Grimaldi and his master's wife about 1720. He married Grimaldi's daughter, and remained on close terms with Alexander Grimaldi, his master's son. Subsequently, he received instruction from Louis Peter Boitard. About 1736 Worlidge and the younger Grimaldi are said to have visited Birmingham, where Worlidge reintroduced the art of painting on glass. For a time, too, he seems to have practised portrait painting at Bath, Somerset. About 1740 Worlidge settled in London in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden, where he remained for the rest of his life. At one time Worlidge's address was ‚Äòat the Piazza, Covent Garden.‚Äô He afterwards resided in Bedford Street and King Street in the same neighbourhood. In 1763 he settled in Great Queen Street in a large house built by Inigo Jones, adjoining the later site of the Freemasons' Tavern. Worlidge became obese and a drinker in later life, and suffered from gout. In his last years he spent much of his leisure in a country house situated in Messrs. Kennedy & Leigh's nursery-ground at Hammersmith. There he died on 23 September 1766, and was buried in Hammersmith church. A plain marble slab, inscribed with verses by William Kenrick, was placed on the wall of the church; it is now at the east end of the south aisle. Works His portraits in oil and pastel enjoyed some vogue, his first reputation was made by his miniature portraits. In middle life his most popular work consisted of heads in blacklead pencil, for which he charged two guineas; leaders of fashionable society employed him to make these drawing. Later he concentrated his energies on etching in the style of Rembrandt, using a dry-needle with triangular point. He copied some of Rembrandt's prints, among them the artist's portrait of himself and the hundred-guelder plate. An etching after Rembrandt's portrait of Sir John Astley was described by Horace Walpole as Worlidge's ‚Äòbest piece.‚Äô Worlidge drew a pencil portrait of himself, which is reproduced in Walpole's Anecdotes (edition by Ralph Nicholson Wornum). Examples of Worlidge's drawings and etchings are in the British Museum print-room. There is also there a priced catalogue of a selection of his etchings. Portrait of King George II, c.1753, by or after Worlidge. One of Worlidge's most popular plates depicted the installation of John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland as chancellor of the university at the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford in 1761. Worlidge represents himself in the gallery on the right in the act of drawing the scene with his second wife beside him. In the corresponding place on the left-hand side of the plate is a portrait of his brother-in-law, Alexander Grimaldi. Most of the numerous heads and figures are portraits. A plate of the bust of Cicero at Oxford (known as the Pomfret bust) also enjoyed a wide vogue. David Garrick in character as Tancred from James Thomson's Tancred and Sigismunda, 1752. In April 1754 Worlidge had a large collection of his works to be sold by public auction. The printed catalogue bore the title, ‚ÄòA Collection of Pictures painted by Mr. Worlidge of Covent Garden, consisting‚Äô ‚Äòof Histories, Heads, Landscapes, and Dead Game, and also some Drawings.‚Äô The highest price fetched was ¬£51 15s. 6d., which was given for a ‚Äòfine head‚Äô after Rembrandt. More than sixteen hundred prints and more than thirteen hundred drawings by Worlidge were sold by Abraham Langford in March 1767 by order of his widow. Worlidge's last work was his Antique Gems, a series of 182 etchings of gems from the antique (three are in duplicate). The series was published in parts, some of which seem to have been issued as early as 1754; but Worlidge died before the work was completed. It was finished by his pupils William Grimaldi and George Powle, and, printed on satin, was published by his widow in 1768 at the price of eighteen guineas a copy.In its original form the volume bore the title, A select Collection of Drawings from curious antique Gems, most of them in the possession of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom, etched after the manner of Rembrandt by T. Worlidge, printed by Dryden Leach for M. Worlidge, Great Queen Street, Lincolns Inn Fields; and M. Wicksteed, Seal-engraver at Bath, MD.CCLXVIII. The frontispiece, dated 1754, shows Worlidge drawing the Pomfret bust of Cicero; behind on an easel is a portrait of his second wife, Mary. No letterpress was included originally in the volume, but between 1768 and 1780 a few copies were issued with letterpress. After 1780 a new edition, but bearing the original date of 1768, appeared with letterpress in two volumes at five guineas each. The title-page omits mention of ‚ÄòM. Wicksteed's‚Äô name, but is otherwise a replica of the first. Some of the old copper plates (108 in all) were reproduced in ‚ÄòAntique Gems, etched by T. Worlidge on Copper Plates, in the Possession of Sheffield Grace, Esq.,‚Äô London, 1823, (privately printed). Charles William King in his Antique Gems (1872, i. 469) thought Worlidge's plates often inferior to those of Jonathan Spilsbury, and that the descriptions placed below contained some blunders. Family Worlidge was three times married: first, to Arabella (b. 1709), daughter of Alessandro Grimaldi (d. 1732); she died before 1749. The name of his second wife was Mary. He married in 1763 his third wife, Elizabeth Wicksteed, daughter of a toyman of Bath, and apparently sister of the well-known seal engraver there. She assisted Worlidge in his artistic work, and gained a reputation for herself by her skill in copying paintings in needlework. After Worlidge's death she carried on the sale of his etchings at his house in Great Queen Street; but she let the mansion to Hester Darby and her daughter, Mary Robinson ('Perdita'), on her marriage to a wine and spirit merchant named Ashley, who had been one of Worlidge's friends. Worlidge is said to have had thirty-two children by his three marriages, but only Thomas, a son by his third wife, survived him. This son married, in 1787, Phoebe, daughter of Alexander Grimaldi (1714‚àí1800); she was buried in Bunhill Fields on 14 January 1829. Her husband migrated to the West Indies in 1792. In March 1826 he was again in London, and while employed as compositor in the office of the Morning Advertiser was sent to prison for an assault. His father drew a portrait of him, which bore the title ‚ÄòA Boy's Head.‚Äô References * Notes ;Attribution Category:1700 births Category:1766 deaths Category:18th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:English engravers ","title":"Thomas Worlidge"},{"id":"32525884","text":"The is a concrete gravity dam on the Kanna River in Ginoza, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

For more than twenty years his economic analyses and reviews have been widely read in the press and on the Internet. He is the author of numerous books, the most recent being Bankocracy (2015); co-authored with Pierre Gottiniaux, Daniel Munevar and Antonio Sanabria (2015); and The Life and Crimes of an Exemplary Man (2014). Several of his books have been published in more than a dozen languages and have become reference works on questions of debt and International Financial Institutions: Debt, the IMF, and the World Bank: Sixty Questions, Sixty Answers (2010); and The World Bank: A Critical Primer (2008). He has taken part in producing two manuals for conducting citizens‚Äô audits. Biography  Born in Namur in 1954, √âric Toussaint lived in the mining village of Retinne, near Li√®ge (Belgium), where his parents were teachers. Retinne had a population of 2,500 people of more than thirty different nationalities. At the age of thirteen, already present in the struggles of that time (opposition to the war in Vietnam and racism, and supporting workers‚Äô struggles and the Prague Spring among others), he joined the students‚Äô union branch of the FGTB. In 1968 he took part in launching a pupils‚Äô movement that spread to several schools. It was the start of many struggles. In 1970 √âric joined the IVth International and helped to create the \\"Workers Revolutionary League\\" (Ligue r√©volutionnaire des travailleurs ‚Äì LRT) in May 1970 and became a member of the Politburo alongside Ernest Mandel. Since 1980 he has been a member of the 4th International's United Secretariat and International Committee.  Professional and political work  √âric Toussaint held senior positions in the public service union CGSP ‚Äì teaching branch. Between 1975 and 1994, he actively participated in numerous popular mobilizations (teachers, steelworkers, municipal workers ...). The 1980s were marked by numerous strikes, either to improve public services (including public education), or for structural anti-capitalist reforms, or again to resist the neoliberal offensive. He was particularly active in strikes and workers‚Äô movements in Li√®ge (where he was a teacher) where the population was overwhelmed by the burden of the city's public debt throughout the 1980s. The notion of international solidarity has had an ever growing influence in his activities and reflections: solidarity with the strikers in Poland in 1980, the British miners in 1984-1985, support for revolutionary experiences by organizing voluntary work brigades to help the farmers in Nicaragua between 1979 and 1989, solidarity against the repression used to quell the \\"Tiananmen square demonstration\\" in 1989, opposition to the blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States government, support for the Palestinian struggle and many other struggles around the world. In 1990 he contributed to the creation of the Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt (CADTM - Henceforth 'Committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt') and became its president. This committee is now an international network that operates in thirty countries on four continents. In 1999 he participated in the creation of ATTAC Belgium and the World Social Forum in Brazil and its international council in 2001, the European Social Forum in 2002 and the Alter Summit in 2012. Since 2000 he has been involved with leftist governments and popular movements in Latin American and elsewhere on the themes of debt, the Bank of the South and other alternatives. In 2003 he advised the new Timor-Leste government on relations with the IMF and the World Bank. In 2005 and in 2008 he was invited by the Economic Commission of the African Union to present propositions on the abolition of illegitimate debts demanded from African countries. In 2005 he took part, with left wing Argentine economists, in the creation of the International Debt Observatory. With the North in the throes of a debt crisis since 2007-2008, Toussaint has worked for the launching and strengthening of citizens‚Äô debt audits in Europe. Toussaint took part in Ecuador‚Äôs Debt Audit Commission (Comisi√≥n para la Auditoria Integral de la Deuda P√∫blica -CAIC), created by the Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, that sat in 2007. In the same year he advised the President and the Minister of Finance of Ecuador on the creation of a \\"Bank of the South\\". The following year he was consulted as an expert on the same matter by the UN. Also in 2008 the Paraguayan President, Fernando Lugo, called on his experience to launch a debt audit for Paraguay. In 2008 he also advised the Venezuelan Minister for Economic Development and Planning. In September 2010 Toussaint spoke in New York at a UN Special Assembly to assess progress on the Millennium Development Goals. Since 2010 he has been involved in citizens‚Äô debt audit initiatives in Europe, in Greece, Portugal, Spain, France and Belgiums. He was consulted by the Brazilian Parliamentary Congress on the debt in 2011 and by the Brazilian Economic Commission in 2013. In 2012 and in 2013, he was invited by Alexis Tsipras, the President of SYRIZA to discuss the Greek debt situation. In October 2014 he was invited by the majority Members of Parliament of the Argentine National Congress, working to establish the debt audit commission mentioned in the Argentine \\"Sovereign payment law\\" passed in September 2014, to speak in a debate on \\"Debt and National Sovereignty in Latin America\\". Between April and November 2015, √âric Toussaint was the Scientific coordinator of the Truth Committee on the Greek Public Debt set up and terminated by the President of the Hellenic Parliament. Teaching career Between 1975 and 1994, Toussaint taught several subjects in many public institutions of technical and vocational education of the city of Liege, including history. Between 1980 and 1984, he also taught economics at the Andr√© Renard Foundation, the training school for FGTB (General Federation of Labour of Belgium, biggest union in Wallonia and Brussels) activists, in Li√®ge. Between 1994 and 2014, his trade union, the General Confederation of public services - education branch (affiliated to the FGTB), released him to focus entirely on CADTM activities. Meanwhile, he resumed university studies in political science and was awarded a doctorate from the Universities of Li√®ge and Paris VIII in 2004. Since 1998, he has taught at the Belgian Technical Cooperation on the subject of alternatives to debt and global financial flows. During the academic years 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, he taught a course at the University of Li√®ge on North/South relations. He is also a fellow of the politically progressive International Institute for Research and Education.

History This fort is believed to be built by Shilahar kings and subsequently used by the Nizam of Ahmednagar. The great Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji is also believed to have reconstructed this fort. The work was carried out in a hurry and hence the name 'Avchit' (hurry) 'gad' (fort).

The previous parliamentary election was only held in October 2010. The elections resulted in Harmony Centre winning the most seats, up two to 31. This was the first time a pro-Russian party had won the most seats in a Latvian election. Unity, previously the largest party, fell to third, with 20 seats, behind the newly formed Zatlers' Reform Party, led by ex-President Valdis Zatlers, who had triggered the dissolution referendum in May. The right-wing National Alliance gained six seats to 14. Both the Union of Greens and Farmers and Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way lost heavily, with the latter falling out of the Saeima altogether. Zatlers and incumbent Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis soon agreed to form a coalition. Needing nine further seats to give them a majority allowed three possible coalitions ‚Äì with Harmony Centre, the National Alliance, or the Union of Greens and Farmers. The Greens and Farmers were quickly ruled out by Zatlers, who judged it to be an \\"oligarch's party\\". After initial talks with the National Alliance, the two briefly discussed a grand coalition with Harmony Centre. However, Zatlers and Unity returned to the National Alliance, and the three signed a coalition agreement on 11 October, with Dombrovskis as Prime Minister. The new government was confirmed by the Saeima on 25 October. A few days before the government formation, six MPs split from Zatlers' Reform Party; they still supported the new government, however. Background Prior to the elections, a number of changes in Latvia's party system occurred: * The Social Democratic Party \\"Harmony\\" absorbed Daugavpils City Party. * The People's Party dissolved itself amid high debts and quickly sinking popularity.Nolemj likvidƒìt Tautas partiju * For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and All For Latvia! turned their election alliance National Alliance into a joint party. * The New Era Party, Civic Union and Society for Other Politics turned their election alliance Unity into a joint party.Apollo ‚Äì Zi≈Üas: Izveidota partija ¬´Vienotƒ´ba¬ª . Apollo.lv. Retrieved on 19 September 2011. * Former president Valdis Zatlers (responsible for the referendum) founded Zatlers' Reform Party, which is enjoying great popularity in election polls. Zatlers' stated goal is to remove the influence of oligarchs on Latvian politics; with the dissolution of the People's Party, the parties Zatlers considers to represent oligarchs are the Union of Greens and Farmers and Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way. Results The Harmony Centre party, led by Nils U≈°akovs, finished with about 29% of the vote, followed by Zatlers' Reform Party with 21% and the Unity party with 18%. The National Alliance and the Union of Greens and Farmers were the only other parties to enter Parliament, with fourteen and twelve percent of the vote, respectively. Harmony Centre's victory was the first for a pro-Russian party since Latvia's independence; the party has ties to United Russia. Government formation Despite winning the most seats, Harmony Centre, was unable to come to an agreement to form a coalition that would hold a majority in parliament immediately after the election. Usakovs entered talks with Zatlers Reform Party and Unity following the election with the aim of forming a coalition, though political analysts said that a potential stumbling block in the talks could be the opposition of other parties to Harmony Centre's connection to Latvia's Russian-speaking population. The most likely potential coalition was predicted to be Zatlers' Reform Party, Unity and National Alliance.Maktl√∂sa vinnare i Lettland. Dagens Nyheter. 2011-09-18. Valdis Dombrovskis was believed to remain Prime Minister, despite his party finishing behind the Reform Party. Zatlers stated on 1 October 2011 that he preferred a coalition with Dombrovskis as PM and including Harmony Centre. However, on 10 October 2011, reports indicated a coalition with the National Alliance was all but certain. Eventually a Unity-Reform Party-National Alliance coalition was formed.

Romeo Monteiro, at Kala Academy (Panjim-Goa), in April 2008 The Santa Cecilia Choir (Coro di Santa Cecilia) is a polyphonic male choir composed of seminarians of the Rachol Seminary of the Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman in Goa, India. History In compliance with the wishes of Dom Antonio Sebasti√£o Valente, the Archbishop of Goa and the first Prelate to be conferred the title of Patriarch of the East Indies, the seminarians organised themselves into a choral society. It was on 11 April 1897, that the first meeting of the choir was held in the hall of Dom Sebasti√£o at the Rachol Seminary and was attended by the founder members: Msgr. Matheus d‚Äô Oliveira (Rector), Fr. Agostinho da Rocha (Professor of Music) Sem. Pedro Antonio Lopes (Choir Master), Fr. Luis Bruno Menezes and twelve other seminarians. The newly born Choir was baptised Orpheon Palestriniano do Semin√°rio (Palestrianian Orpheon of the Seminary) or simply Coro Palestriniano. From the name, it is evident that the initial aim of the Choir was to promote sacred polyphonic chant, according to the method of the famous Italian Composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, who lived during the late 16th century, and was a pioneer in the sacred music of his age. On 23 March 1905, the same Archbishop-Patriarch gave new statutes to this association and determined that in future it should be named simply Coro de Santa Cecilia (Santa Cecilia Choir). The change was perhaps to place the Choir under the patronage of St. Cecilia, the patroness of music and musicians, and to allow the Choir to venture into other forms of music rather than restrict itself to the Palestrinian form only. It is with this name that the Seminary Choir went down in history and is known even today. Today, this male TTBB Choir, presided over by the Rector of the Seminary, continues to function and dedicates itself to promoting the sacred heritage of music of the Catholic Church. Seminarians (ordinary members of the choir) singing under the baton of Rev. Romeo Monteiro, Professor of Music at the Seminary (2010) The Professor of Music in the Seminary is the Vice-President and Conductor of the Choir. The other \\"ordinary\\" members (about sixteen in number) are chosen at the beginning of the academic by the Professor of Music. Formerly, these members were called membros efectivos (effective members) and were elected by secret ballot, from among the general members of the choir. They were also granted certain privileges in the Seminary; this is no longer the case. Besides, as the need suggest or the occasion demands, others (seminarians and laity) are invited to join in the singing as \\"extra-ordinary members\\" of the Choir. From among the ordinary members, one is chosen to perform the task of Chorus Master and Secretary. His main responsibility is to look into the day to day functioning of the Choir and rehearse for the approaching programs. Past directors The Santa Cecilia Choir has sung uninterrupted under the direction of renowned musicians who were appointed Professors of Music at the Seminary. Here is a list of the Directors of the Santa Cecilia Choir: * Rev. Agostinho de Rocha (founder Director) * Rev. Luis Bruno Menezes * Rev. Francisco Domingos Luis * Rev. Sebasti√£o Luis * Rev. Lellis de Vitoria e Souza (1945‚Äì1951) * Maestro Rev. Camilo Ant√≥nio da Conceic√£o Xavier (1951‚Äì1983) * Maestro Rev. Dr. Lourdino Paulo Barreto (1983‚Äì1984) * Rev. Tom√© Bernardo Cota (1984‚Äì2007) * Rev. Romeo Monteiro (2007‚Äì2013) Significance For over a century, this characteristic male Choir of young seminarians from India has proved its calibre and excellence in polyphony of different genres, secular as well as religious. Following the directives given by the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, the Santa Cecilia Choir has stood out in preserving and developing the rich musical patrimony of the Catholic Church. The Choir is proud of a rich repertoire of religious and secular music in Latin, English and the vernaculars: Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Verdi, Schubert, Palestrina, Praglia, Rossini, Liberto, Martins, Xavier, Barreto, Paranjoti, etc. In recent years, it has also performed pop-polyphonic music. Traditionally, every year, the Choir sings a solemn polyphonic mass in Latin, interspaced with Gregorian chant, on the occasion of the feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola, Patron of the Seminary Church. Perhaps, today, it is the only exponent of Gregorian chant in India. Various choral recitals, featuring religious and secular music are held in the seminary on different occasions. On 31 July 1997, the Choir celebrated the centenary of its inception, with a solemn Eucharist presided by Archbishop-Patriarch Raul Nicolau Gonsalves. The Cecilians, under the baton of Rev. Bernardo Cota, rendered Messe in G dur by Franz Schubert, besides the hymns of the mass in Konkani. Te Deum in A by Arnold Furlotti was also sung by the young seminarians. The Choir was ably supported by a string quintet, composed of seminarians. Concerts From 2007 onwards, the Choir, under the baton of Rev. Romeo Monteiro, and in association with ex-members and other music lovers, has given several well-appreciated performances of sacred and secular music, in the cities of Panjim, Margao, Old Goa. The first performance in this series was held in Old Goa, as a tribute to the great music legend of Goa, the late Maestro Rev. Lourdino Barreto, ex-member and ex-director of the Choir, on the occasion of his tenth death anniversary. The following year, the Cecilian choir presented the secular repertoire of Maestro Barreto at a gala concert held at the Kala Academy, Panjim, where Barreto had served as Director of the Western Music School. The Santa Cecilia Choir also featured at the Monte Festival of Music, Old Goa, in Feb. 2010 and the World Konkani Cultural Convention in Mangalore, in Dec. 2010.http://www.daijiworld.com/news/wkcc/default.asp?col_id=68http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=210836&newstype;=local It was a privilege for the Choir which was invited by the Apostolic Nuncio to India, His Excellency Most Rev. Salvatore Pennacchio, on 19‚Äì20 April 2012, to New Delhi, to animate the singing at the solemn Eucharist and to present a Programme in honour of Pope Benedict XVI, on the 7th anniversary of His Pontificate. The Gregorian Chants and other soul-lifting liturgical hymns were greatly appreciated by the Apostolic Nuncio and by the Prelates and laity who participated in the Eucharist. Concert at the Apostolic Nunciature, New Delhi, in April 2012 The Programme of Sacred Music on the following day, which consisted in Latin, English, Hindi, Sanskrit and Konkani repertoire, was a spectacular performance. Fourth centenary celebrations On 1 November 2010, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Fourth Centenary Celebrations of the Seminary, the Choir led the congregation with soul-elevating renderings in Latin and Konkani. There were in all 80 singers (seminarians and laity), accompanied by the restored 19th century pipe organ and an ensemble of 15 musicians. It was a celestial moment when the Choir led the congregation in sing the Gloria taken from the sublime Missa De Angelis in Gregorian chant, with polyphonic choral responses composed by Msgr. Giuseppe Liberto. Maestro Liberto was at that time Director of the Sistine Choir in Rome. He had lent his work, originally composed for the Installation Ceremony of Benedict XVI, to be utilized on for the Jubilee of the Rachol Seminary. The brilliant performance of Sacred Music, at the Basilica of Bom Jesus, on 11 April 2011, was something rare in the musical annals of Goa. This program, with the participation of about 150 singers and musicians, brought the Fourth Centenary celebrations of Rachol Seminary to a close. The program for the evening comprised: Gloria (RV 588) by Antonio Vivaldi, hymns to St. Francis Xavier and Bl. Joseph Vaz and compositions by ex-Directors of the Choir. The Te Deum, sung in a polyphonic setting with the traditional Gregorian melody as refrain, proved to be a fitting finale of praise to the Most Holy Trinity for the 400 years of Rachol Seminary. The Archbishop-Patriarch, Most Rev. Filipe Neri Ferr√£o graced the occasion in the midst of a packed Basilica. Concert in memory of Rev. Crist√≥v√£o Caldeira On 2 April 2012, a Concert of Sacred Music was held in memory of late Fr. Crist√≥v√£o Caldeira, former Rector of the Patriarchal Seminary of Rachol and the president of the Choir from 1993 to 2000. This programme held in the renovated Church of Santana-Talaulim, Ilhas, enthralled the audience that overflowed the grand Church with magnificent acoustics. Setting off with Pater Noster in plain chant, the Cecilians rendered excerpts from famous Requiem works by renowned composers, ranging from the 18th to the 21st century: Introit and Kyrie (by Gabriel Faur√©), Dies irae (by Franz von Supp√©), Lacrimosa (by W. A. Mozart), Pie Iesu (by Luigi Cherubini), Lux aeterna (by Maurice Durufl√©) and The Lord is my shepherd (by John Rutter). The director, Fr. Monteiro, also inserted his composition in Latin and Konkani \\"Dev-dut tuka voinkunttant gheun vhorum\\". Set to orchestra and choir in four voices, this composition was comparable to those of the masters, and unveiled the deep riches of the text which otherwise goes unnoticed and even unheard in the din of activity of funeral services when it is recited. Besides the choir also sang a traditional Goan motet (Khorench sangtam) and some well known chorales: Were you there? (by Raymond Haan) and Since by Man ‚Äì Worthy is the Lamb (from the Messiah, by G. F. Handel).http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/classical-lenten-concert-santana- talaulim On the occasion, an audio CD album, entitled 'TE DEUM' was released by the Archbishop. This album, produced by the Santa Cecilia Choir, showcases sacred music of several genres and styles, sung in Goa, during various periods of history. The compositions are by various composers, world-renowned and local, and are sung in various languages: Konkani, Latin, English, Hindi and Sanskrit. Concert to celebrate the \\"Year of Faith 2012-2013\\" On 19 April 2013, the Choir, presented a concert of sacred music in the [S√© Catedral] Cathedral Church at Old Goa, to commemorate the \\"Year of Faith 2012‚Äì2013\\", proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI and celebrated by Catholics worldworld. Concert of Sacred Music to celebrate the Year of Faith, held at the See Cathedral, Old Goa, in April 2013 This solemn concert of Sacred Catholic music was presented by 140 dedicated artists (88 singers and 51 musicians), mostly youngsters. The evening began with the rendition of the Pontifical Anthem (by Gounod), in honour of the See of Peter. After introductory words by the Parish Priest of the Cathedral, Fr. Leonardo Correia, the Choir sang some simple Catholic prayer-formulas, viz. \\"Santa Khursachi Kuru\\" (the Sign of the Cross, in Konkani), \\"Abun d'bashmayo\\" (the Our Father as believed by the Catholic Church to have been actually prayed by Jesus in the original Aramaic-Syrian chant), \\"Namaste Mary'yame\\" (the Hail Mary, in Sanskrit Vedic chant), all composed and arranged by Rev. Romeo Monteiro. \\"Mhoima Bapak\\", a Konkani doxology to the Holy Trinity, composed by Rev. Bernardo Cota, ended the first part of the Concert. The second part of the performance consisted of a rendition of different versions of the Creed that encapsulates the faith of the Catholic Church. Three models of creeds were chosen for the evening: the traditional Latin Credo (in Gregorian chant), \\"Credo\\" from the famous Coronation Mass (by W. A. Mozart), and finally \\"Sot'mantam\\" in Konkani (by Fr. Monteiro). The third part of the Musical Concert contained the Easter proclamation through the work of the reputed German composer L. van Beethoven - \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" from Christus am √ñlberge (Christ on the Mount of Olives). This was followed by a Goan version of the Easter invocation to Mary, Regina caeli (arranged by Maestro Rev. Lourdino Barreto and orchestrated by Fr. Monteiro). The traditional Goan \\"Exultemos com alegria\\", in Portuguese (arranged by Fr. Monteiro), ended the evening bringing nostalgic memories of this hymn which used to be sung at Litanies in Goa.

Senecio franciscanus) is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name San Francisco Peaks groundsel, or San Francisco Peaks ragwort. It is endemic to Arizona in the United States, where it is known only from the San Francisco Peaks in Coconino County. It is threatened by recreational activities in its habitat. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. Description Packera franciscana is a small rhizomatous perennial herb growing just a few centimeters tall. The purple or purple-tinged stems have woolly or cobwebby fibers. The basal leaves have lyre-shaped to somewhat oval blades measuring up to 2 centimeters long by 5 wide. They have ruffled edges and purple undersides.Packera franciscana. Center for Plant Conservation. Retrieved July 26, 2011. Leaves higher on the stems are smaller and sometimes divided into lobes. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head or a few heads clustered together atop the woolly stem. The flower head is enclosed in hairy purple phyllaries and contains 8 or 13 yellow ray florets up to a centimeter long. The fruit is an achene tipped with a pappus half a centimeter in length. Blooming occurs in August through October.Packera franciscana. Flora of North America. Retrieved July 26, 2011. The plant reproduces sexually via seed, but more often vegetatively by resprouting from its rhizome.

It grows in alpine tundra habitat in the volcanic talus of the mountain slopes, an area with little vegetation located above the tree line. This is the only alpine zone in Arizona. The elevation is between 3200 and 3800 meters, with most of the plants occurring between 3525 and 3605 meters.Fowler, J. F. and C. H. Sieg. (2011). Density and elevational distribution of the San Francisco Peaks ragwort, Packera franciscana (Asteraceae), a threatened single-mountain endemic. Madro√±o 57(4) 213-19. The plant is apparently adapted to a fellfield habitat made up of unstable talus, as evidenced by its long rhizome and adventitious roots which may not be anchored to any stable surface. As rocks tumble, the root may break, and pieces of the root can generate new plants through cloning. Despite its being limited to a small area, the plant is common locally. Habitat threats Threats to this species include recreational activities such as mountaineering, hiking, and skiing. Expansion of the Arizona Snowbowl was likely to disturb the habitat, but construction was put on hold after a legal challenge. Conservation efforts have included the installation of trails away from spots where the plants are growing and the closing of alpine habitat to recreation except by permit. This mountaintop-dwelling plant may suffer during climate change, because it cannot move to higher or colder habitat as warming occurs.

The Gili Eco Trust has extended its activities to many Eco projects to regenerate coral reefs and fish abundance, weekly beach clean ups, educating in the local and international schools, organize recycling and garbage collection schemes, universities' research and studies, set up sustainable Eco tourism with green energies, give animal care and free welfare clinics and much more.  History  Dead coral In 1998, SATGAS was funded by local people on the Gili islands to protect coral. Between 1997-1998 and because of many degradation causes corals were in such a bad shape that local people decided to react and started patrolling around the islands. They entered into an agreement with fishermen to define fishing areas and lawful fishing practices. Fishermen were indeed fishing with dynamite and cyanide. This destructive method was one of the main causes of coral degradation. The Gili Eco Trust was founded in 2000 by the dive shops on the Gili islands to financially support the SATGAS. An eco donation of 50,000IDR (‚Ç¨4, US$5) is encouraged from every diver to mitigate their impact to the island upon visiting. Manta ray Biorock reef In 2004, Delphine Robbe, part-time coordinator of Gili Eco Trust, imported the Biorock technology in Gili islands to launch a Coral Reefs Restoration Program. Since then 63 Biorock structures have been installed all around the Gili islands to regenerate their reefs. Since 2006 the Gili Eco Trust has been organizing Biorock workshops every two years. In November 2006 took place the 4th international Biorock workshop. Two other workshops took place in November 2008 and November 2010 with always more participants from all around the world. Delphine Robbe, Gili Eco Trust manager, teaching about Vetiver grass 2009 was a turning point: the Gili Eco Trust extended its projects to land environment protection. To support all these projects, Delphine Robbe became full-time coordinator. 2016 saw more than 110 Biorock structures installed in areas where coral reefs were previously destroyed due to illegal anchoring, overfishing and storm damages followed by an unprecedented Il Nino event causing warmer sea temperatures and little or no rainfall in the wet season between November to March. Following this, more than 80% of the Gili Islands coral reefs were deemed bleached or severely bleached as sea temperatures exceeded 32'c for more than 2 months. The Biorock's increased resilience to climate change helped more than 75% corals survive on the structures whereas natural reefs lost up to 40% of coral cover. Now the Gili Eco Trust leads many various projects to ensure Gili islands' sustainable development and promote eco-tourism.  Projects  The Gili Eco Trust has implemented projects to protect and regenerate corals, and to preserve land environment on the Gili islands.  Coral Protection  Gili Eco Trust's mooring buoys The Gili Eco Trust cooperates with the SATGAS (and more recently the marine authorities of North Lombok BKKPN) to protect coral reefs. 20 days per month and on call, members of the SATGAS patrol to be sure that no one destructs coral and that fishermen respect the agreement on fishing areas and lawful fishing practices. The Gili Eco Trust is installing mooring buoys to avoid anchoring on coral reefs. Mooring buoys also help to mark the boundaries of fishing areas. To gain further students and undergrads to learn more about coral and how to protect it, the Gili Eco Trust has developed a partnership with Mataram University, Lombok. Students in PhD, specialized in marine biology, come to Gili Trawangan to do studies on coral and to learn about Biorock technology. \\"Coral Watch\\" dives are also available in every dive shop. Data collected during the dive help Project Aware scientists in their studies on coral reefs.  Coral Restoration  Attaching coral to a Biorock structure Coral is facing so many factors of degradation that the Gili Eco Trust decided not only to protect coral reefs but to restore them too. A Biorock Coral Reef Restoration Program has been implemented since 2006. Biorock method consists in installing new artificial coral reefs on the ocean floor. These reefs can have two positive roles: being ideal habitats for corals, fish, shellfish, mollusks, seaweed, etc. and being efficient wave breakers which protect beaches from erosion. Now the Gili Eco Trust wants to develop a Biorock structure which would be provided with electricity by a turbine thanks to sea current. Thus, Biorock method would be more sustainable. Today, 63 Biorock structures regenerate the Gili islands' coral reefs. In the same time, the Gili Eco Trust organizes Biorock workshops every two years to teach people from all around the world about Biorock so that they can replicate it in other damaged coral areas. In 2006 the workshop received 31 participants, 52 in 2008 and 80 in 2010. These workshops are supported by PADI, Project Aware, the Global Coral Reef Alliance, Mataram University, the Lombok government and many businesses on Gili Trawangan.  Land Eco-Projects  The Gili Eco Trust has various activities on the Gili islands. Children participating at the clean up day ;Waste Management Gili Eco Trust's main project on land is improving waste management. Waste is a permanent issue for Gili islands, especially because of their tourism. The Gili Eco Trust works with the FMPL (the waste collection and treatment company on Gili Trawangan) which collects waste every day. The waste dump has been rebuilt and an elevated road has been built to reach it even during rainy season. Local people are used to burning their waste. This method is extremely polluting. The Gili Eco Trust tries to raise awareness about it and to change local habits and encourages recycling. General compost has been created, more than a thousand coloured bins have been installed, reusable bags are distributed. Tetra briks are sent to Eco Bali, a partner of the Gili Eco Trust. Glass, cardboard, aluminium cans and plastic are recycled in building materials. Finally the Gili Eco Trust organizes clean up days every first Friday of the month. Tourists can join children from the local school, volunteers from businesses, the Gili Eco Trust and the FMPL and get a free dive in exchange of their participation. *Glass: Almost one third of the volume of the rubbish dump on Gili T. consists of glass bottles. Only Bintang bottles are consistently being sent back to the supplier to be refilled, which is the most environmentally efficient way of dealing with empty glass bottles. Although this would also be an option for all other beer bottles, for many small businesses, the cost of collecting and shipping them to the mainland is not economically viable. These bottles, along with all the ones which don't have a deposit on them end up in the overflowing dump in the center of the island or on Lombok as there is no local glass recycling factory. *Glass workshop: One of the solutions for using all the unrecycled glass was to ‚Äúturn trash to treasures‚Äù and make drinking glasses, ashtrays, lampshades and earrings out of the empty bottles. After a few weeks of research, volunteers set up the glass upcycling workshop on Gili T using locally available tools and a local worker can create products out of discarded bottles. These environmentally friendly wares have already been purchased and put into use by some of Gili T's businesses. Prices range Rp 15,000 to Rp 60,000 per item. *Bottle walls: Discarded bottles were used as bricks to create a Smirnoff Ice bottle wall next to Intan Inn Hostel and within Sama Sama bungalows. Plastic waste of different colors was stored within the bottles, thus creating patterns in the wall, and offering a more environmentally friendly solution to plastic waste than burning or dumping it. Broken Compass Hostel used all sorts of bottles as internal windows, sources of natural light and lampshades. *Sand and gravel: As a further solution to the huge amounts of unrecycled glass on the island, the GET invested in two glass crushing machines which produce sand and gravel for use in building projects. *Deposit bottle collection: The GET aims to centralize the collection of bottles which have a deposit on them and group their shipping so that it becomes economically viable to send them back to Lombok for refill. Children gardening at the school Animal care Horses' treatment ;Horses On Gili islands, horses suffer from poor treatment. Whereas horses normally live about 25 years, they do not live more than a few years on Gili islands because of the amount of work they are demanded and the lack of care from their owners who ignore what they need. Pulling carts around the island wouldn't be a problem for their health if they could drink fresh water and rest regularly, and be treated when they need to. Gili Eco Trust operates free to the islands' horses three times every year, in association with the Animal Aid Abroad Australia and encourages businesses to install in front of their shop a fresh water bucket for the horses. ;Cats Special free clinics are organized to sterilize stray and pet cats by the Cats Of Gili in partnership with Gili Eco Trust, helped by voluntary western veterinary surgeons to help control the population of cats on the island and to improve their livelihoods and welfare. ;Turtles The Gili Eco Trust supports turtle conservation and to preserve our famous populations of Green and Hawksbill turtles. There is no longer any head starting programmes on Gili Trawangan as it is more beneficial for the turtle eggs to be left untouched in the sand and to hatch naturally before immediately entering the ocean. The Gili Eco Trust creates sturdy protection cages to guard the nests for the 30-60 days they are in the sand. When a nest has been reported then the Gili Eco Trust will respond by recording nest size, species and protecting and keeping watch over the eggs.  Raising awareness  10 recommendations for an eco-behavior To make things and behaviors really evolve, the Gili Eco Trust raises awareness amongst local inhabitants and tourists. Every week, Delphine Robbe, Gili Eco Trust manager, teaches the three local school's classes about ecology and English. During 45 minutes, children from six to twelve years old think about solutions to preserve natural richness of Indonesia. They are taught at school on how to cultivate tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, aloe vera and vetiver grass. But the Gili Eco Trust does not only target children. To make every person on Gili islands improve his/her behavior, posters and notice boards have been put up. Gili Eco Trust offers to come to businesses to train their staff in eco-behavior. In the same way, boats owners can be explained why coral is important and how to behave to not damage it.  Biorock  Biorock technology has been invented by Professor Wolf Hilbertz and Doctor Thomas J. Goreau at the end of the 1970s.  Principle  Zoom on a Biorock structure Biorock structures are made with crisscrossed metal stems which are crossed by a low-voltage current of 1,2 Volts. These structures are installed on the ocean floor and pieces of corals are attached to them. These corals come from reefs in the neighborhood and were broken for various reasons such as unaware divers and strong waves. The electric current, which is totally harmless for any organism, leads to electrolysis, causing a calcareous precipitation on the whole structure. This will not only avoid the unwanted appearance of rust which would weaken the structure, but, as coral's skeleton is made of calcareous, the structure will, thanks to this reaction, become the best place for coral to develop. Thus Biorock technology relies on a very simple principle: reproduction by electrolysis of the natural reaction occurring between coral, sea water, sun and dissolve minerals.  Results  Two Biorock reefs Biorock technology's electrolysis is catalysis of the natural reaction and not only a simple reproduction, as this electrolysis enables a coral's development 2 to 6 times faster than in usual conditions. Normally coral grows from only some centimeters per year. And so getting its growth quicker is an efficient way to restore reefs. Moreover, coral on Biorock structures grows stronger and is more resistant to hazards it faces. Hard corals are not the only ones to grow on Biorock structures: tunicates, bivalves, sponges and soft corals also come to develop at speeds higher than the average. On a Biorock structure, their survival and resistance rate is 20 to 50 times higher than in natural environment. Finally, because Biorock technology relies on electrolysis, its impact benefits all corals and ecosystems around the metal structure in a perimeter with a wingspan of about thirty meters. These already studied and proved by W. Hilbertz and T. Goreau facts are born out since the 1980s by the efficiency of Biorock structures installed all around the world. These structures contributed to damaged coral reefs‚Äô restoration, enlargement of beaches touched by erosion, repopulation of marine areas with many species of fishes and other sea organisms.

Sources seem to be uniform in their identification of Washer as \\"Ensign\\" and only one source has been found which states that his name was \\"Thos\\" (Thomas).One source lists \\"Wisher\\" in parenthesis after his name, signifying that Washer is a possible erroneous rendering of Wisher, although every source consulted actually lists the colonist's name as Washer. Even if this is true and can be verified, the colonist is shown as Ensign Washer here because that is how he is shown in sources which identify him as a member of the first session of the House of Burgesses. Before 1619, Ensign Washer, Captain Nathaniel Basse and Giles Jones received patents for land along the Pagan River. Captain Christopher Lawne then settled near the mouth of Lawne's Creek in the same vicinity. Although the area was known as Lawne's Plantation and its representatives were listed as representatives from the plantation, the colonists also had named the area \\"Warresqueak County\\"Variations of this spelling may be found in some sources. after the Native American tribe who lived there. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619.Stanard, William G. and Mary Newton Stanard.

He joined the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in 2010 but failed to qualify for any of the television majors. Hudson earned a full PDC Pro Tour card for the 2011 and 2012 seasons via the PDC's Qualifying School. Career In 2011, Hudson qualified for the 2011 UK Open. He made an appearance on the TV stage, coming back from 3‚Äì0 down to defeat Magnus Caris 4‚Äì3 in the last 96 stage, winning the decider with a ten-dart leg. However, he then lost to Peter Wright in the last 64 in an untelevised match. Also in 2011, Hudson came within one leg of qualifying for the PDC Grand Slam of Darts. He defeated Nathan Davies, Barrie Webb, Kevin McDine, Keegan Brown and Mark Jones before losing his final qualifying match 4‚Äì3 against Ian White. Hudson's best result in 2012 was at the seventh Players Championship of the year, where he beat the likes of Mervyn King and Robert Thornton, before losing to Ronnie Baxter 6‚Äì1 in the quarter-finals. Hudson beat Jamie Lewis to reach the last 64 of the UK Open for the second successive year. There he played Kim Huybrechts and lost 9‚Äì4. He qualified for three of the five new European Tour events, losing in the first round in two of them. In the other, the German Darts Masters he saw off Alan Tabern 6‚Äì4, before being defeated by reigning world champion Adrian Lewis 6‚Äì1 in the second round. It was these results which largely contributed to Hudson qualifying for the World Championship by finishing 44th on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, claiming the 13th of 16 spots that were awarded to non-qualified players. In his first appearance at the World Championship he lost to James Wade 3‚Äì0 in sets in the first round, as he took just two legs during the match. Hudson was ranked world number 55 after the event. At the 2013 UK Open, Hudson lost 5‚Äì4 to Mark Lawrence in the second round. He qualified for three European Tour events during the year but lost in the first round on each occasion. His best results came in the second half of the season in the eighth and fifteenth Players Championship where he lost in the last 16 6‚Äì1 to Paul Nicholson and 6‚Äì3 to Michael Smith respectively. Hudson advanced to the third round of the UK Open for the third time in 2014, but narrowly lost 9‚Äì8 against Ian White. At the penultimate Players Championship of 2014 he saw off Dan Russell, Peter Wright, Benito van de Pas and Kim Huybrechts to make the quarter-finals of a PDC event for the first time, which he lost 6‚Äì4 to White. He finished 2014 outside of the top 64 on the Order of Merit and did not enter Q School. Hudson qualified for the 2015 UK Open by winning the Riley's Sheffield qualifier, but lost 5‚Äì4 to Rob Smith in the first round. He claimed the first title of his career at the 14th Challenge Tour event by beating Ryan Palmer 5‚Äì4. At the second UK Open Qualifier of 2016, Hudson advanced to his second ever PDC quarter-final and lost 6‚Äì3 to Phil Taylor. He was knocked out 6‚Äì4 in the second round of the UK Open by Dirk van Duijvenbode. Six wins saw him reach the final of the fourth Challenge Tour event, where he lost 5‚Äì4 to Bryan de Hoog. A second last 16 appearance in a main tour event this year came at the 11th Players Championship and he was beaten 6‚Äì2 by Robbie Green.

Vol.IV. Novelets and Stories, 1912‚Äì1917. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. 1965. Commentaries, pp. 483‚Äì488. Translated into English by D. H. Lawrence (with Samuil Koteliansky), the story is one of Bunin's best known and regarded as classic.  Background  Bunin recollected the circumstances that led to the story's inception in a brochure called \\"The Origins of My Stories\\", compiled and published by P. Vyacheslavov. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice book sleeve, which had caught Bunin's eye in one of the Moscow book shops, served as a starting point for the story's associative chain. Some time later in Oryol Governorate it came back to him again, this time linked to the sudden death of a certain American citizen which occurred on the island of Capri. \\"Almost instantly the idea of a story [called initially] \\"Death on Capri\\" came to me and in four days I finished the piece. Everything else, San Francisco included, was pure fantasy. Nothing in it was real apart from the fact that once a certain American had really died after dinner in Quisisana hotel\\", Bunin wrote.Literatura I Zhizn, Moscow, 1960, August 5. The rough copies and alternative versions of the story show the dynamics of its ever-changing history. Over the years Bunin, driven (in Chekhov's words) by the \\"brevity mania\\", was methodically cutting the text down in size (the last bout of such activity lasted from 1951 to the early 1953). Among the fragments cut were one lengthy description of a \\"Belshazzar feast\\" on board the Atlantida ship and a Tolstoyan monologue which the author deemed, apparently, too straightforward in its condemnation of the main character's way of life.  Synopsis  A 58-year-old American from San Francisco, having acquired a great fortune, sets off with his wife and daughter on a world tour. After a luxurious cruise, they arrive in Naples, where he is dismayed by the unusually bad winter weather and finds that the city does not meet his expectations. They then go to Capri, where he abruptly dies in the lobby of his fancy hotel, causing a stir among the rich clientele. The second half of the story is concerned with the change in the once-deferential staff's attitude towards the gentleman, and in the dehumanizing way in which his body is treated as it makes its journey out of Italy.  Critical reception  Upon its release the story was widely discussed and generally praised in the Russian press. According to critic Abram Derman, after Chekhov and Tolstoy's respective deaths nothing worthy of notice appeared in the Russian literature at all, up until \\"The Gentleman from San Francisco\\" release. \\"Bunin has developed greatly as an artist over the last few years, mainly by widening enormously his emotional scope. There is not a shade of irritation in his dislike of the American gentleman; his antipathy is embracingly wide, to a huge creative effect. With solemn, saintly sadness the author created one massive portrait of the global evil; the vast landscape of general sinfulness in which a proud modern man with an old heart habitates. And for the reader ‚Äì the author's coldness towards his character feels not only well justified and logical, but very beautiful,\\" Derman wrote in 1916. He found most remarkable the style of the story too, speaking of \\"rhythmic metallic beat of flawless, loaded phrases reminding... rhythms of resonating bells; richness and chastity of language where there's not a single word that would be either missing or superfluous.\\"Derman, –ê. The Triumph of an Artist // –ü–æ–±–µ–¥–∞ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∞. Russkaya Mysl. Moscow. 1916. Book 5, pp.26-27. More cautious was the Russkoye Bogatstvo magazine review. \\"The story is strong but it suffers from what the French call \\"its own virtues\\". The counterpoint between the outward gloss of the modern culture and its trifle insignificance in the face of death is exploited with gripping power, but the author drains the potential of this conflict down to the bottom, what with the image of the main character ‚Äì an old American millionaire ‚Äì being consciously confined to contours of a common stereotype. One cannot indulge with juggling symbols infinitely and get away with it. Symbols, when they are that recognizable, easily turn into schemes. ‚Ä¶Both in \\"Aglaya\\" and \\"The Gentleman from San Francisco\\" a thesis runs at the forefront, psychology's being lost in the rear,\\" wrote the reviewer.Russkoys Bogatstvo.

This act was intended to prevent the sovereign default that could have resulted from the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis. The objective of the committee was to develop a deficit reduction plan over 10 years in addition to the $917 billion of cuts and initial debt limit increase of $900 billion in the Budget Control Act of 2011 that avoided a U.S. sovereign default. The committee recommendation was to have been subject to a simple vote by the full legislative bodies without amendment; this extraordinary provision was included to limit partisan gridlock. The goal outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011 was to cut at least $1.5 trillion over the coming 10 years (avoiding much larger \\"sequestration\\" across-the- board cuts which would be equal to the debt ceiling increase of $1.2 trillion incurred by Congress through a failure to produce a deficit reduction bill), therefore bypassing Congressional debate and resulting in a passed bill by December 23, 2011. On November 21, the committee concluded its work, issuing a statement that began with the following: \\"After months of hard work and intense deliberations, we have come to the conclusion today that it will not be possible to make any bipartisan agreement available to the public before the committee's deadline.\\" The committee was formally terminated on January 31, 2012.Section 401(d) of the Budget Control Act of 2011, Historical precedents In both form and process, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was an unusual construct in the American federal legislative system. The Base Realignment and Closure process provides a partial precedent. Senate historian Donald Ritchie found inexact parallels between the Joint Select Committee and various historical joint committees. The only precedent for the committee's power to write and report legislation is the 1946‚Äì1977 Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Structure and membership The committee comprised twelve members of Congress, six from the House of Representatives and six from the Senate, with each delegation evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Three members each were appointed by the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House and by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate. Two of the members were designated as co-chairs, one each by the Senate Majority Leader and by the Speaker of the House. The law made no requirement that either chair be from a specific house or a specific party. The Los Angeles Times predicted before the committee was constituted that the \\"most important players\\" in the process would be the four leaders selecting the twelve committee members. Commentators noted that the plan would advance with a seven-member majority if any single member deviated from party lines. Members On August 9, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, announced the Senate's Democratic members of the committee. Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Republican appointments to the committee from both houses on August 10, 2011. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced her choices on the following day. {|class=wikitable |- ! ! Democrats ! Republicans |- valign=top !

Hensarling was vice-chair of the House Committee on Financial Services, chairman emeritus of the Republican Study Committee, and House Republican Conference Chair. Kerry and Baucus were each chairing standing Senate committees (Foreign Relations and Finance, respectively), members of the Senate Finance Committee and were among the ten most senior members of the U.S. Senate. Kyl was Senate Minority Whip. Toomey was a member of the Joint Economic Committee. Portman was a former Director of the Office of Management and Budget and a former U.S. Trade Representative. Camp was chairing the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Upton was chairing the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Clyburn was the third- ranking House Democrat. Becerra was the ranking member of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee and was Vice-Chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Van Hollen was the ranking member of the House Budget Committee and had formerly chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Baucus, Becerra, Camp, and Hensarling had served on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform; all four had voted against the Simpson-Bowles plan that emerged from that committee. Operation The Budget Control Act increased the debt ceiling by $400 billion in August 2011. Concurrently, it required the federal government to make $917 billion in spending cuts over a ten-year period as a first installment. This was based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office using current-law economic baseline, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Under the Act, government revenues were projected to rise after 2012.  Recommendation  The committee was charged with issuing a recommendation by November 23, 2011 for at least $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reduction steps to be undertaken over a ten‚Äêyear period. This would have been the second installment of deficit reduction measures. Possible areas to be examined by the committee included: revenue increases, including raising taxes; tax reforms, such as simplifying the tax code and eliminating some tax breaks and loopholes; military spending cuts; and measures to reform and slow the growth of entitlement programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. According to White House economics adviser Gene Sperling, \\"everything is on the table.\\"  Congressional vote  The committee's recommendations were to have been put to a simple up or down vote by Congress by December 23, 2011. The vote would not have been subject to amendments, House \\"majority of the majority\\" blocks, or Senate filibusters, guaranteeing a pure majority vote in both chambers. A \\"trigger mechanism\\" was included in the bill to enact $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts in the event that the committee could not agree on a recommendation or the full Congress failed to pass it. The bill stipulated that this automatic second installment of deficit reduction measures be split between the national security and domestic arenas, with the biggest entitlement programs excluded. The targeting of the automatic cuts was intended to provide incentives to both sides to compromise.  Hearings and meetings  While the majority of the committee's business was conducted through private negotiations, five hearings and meetings are public record. * September 8, 2011: Organizational Meeting * September 13, 2011: Hearing on The History and Drivers of Our Nation's Debt and Its Threats * September 22, 2011: Hearing - Overview: Revenue Options and Reforming the Tax Code * October 26, 2011: Hearing - Overview: Discretionary Outlays, Security and Non-Security * November 1, 2011: Hearing - Overview of Previous Debt Proposals Debate over merit Support Supporters believed that the prospect of imminent across‚Äìthe‚Äìboard spending cuts if the committee's measures were not adopted would be sufficiently \\"distasteful to lawmakers\\" to prompt them to act and to impart a \\"strong incentive for bipartisan agreement.\\" Representative Rob Andrews of New Jersey supported the idea as a way to \\"avoid a default\\" although he expressed concerns that it would take too long for lawmakers to learn the \\"nuances of Medicare and Medicaid\\" with respect to intricate reimbursement formulas. Criticism Criticism of the committee arrangement included comments from lawmakers concerned by how rapidly the Budget Control Act legislation was put together; they objected to having little time to review the rules by which the committee would operate, and to the lack of input on the mechanism from public hearings or debate. Legislators from both major parties expressed concern that the arrangement would \\"usurp their authority to write and revise legislation.\\" Presidential candidate Representative Ron Paul suggested that members of Congress might be under \\"tremendous pressure\\" to vote for the committee's recommendation regardless of its merit. Huffington Post critic R. W. Sanders described the committee as \\"unelected\\" with power to \\"effectively run our country\\" and possibly issue budget cuts that would \\"basically go unchallenged.\\" Senator Bob Menendez predicted that the committee would become deadlocked with a \\"stacked deck\\" of members opposed to new revenues. An analysis in the New York Times described the committee as similar to other \\"blue-ribbon panels\\" established during the past seventy years as a way to \\"give political cover to policy makers to make unpopular changes\\"; in most past cases Congress has ignored the panel proposals or procrastinated enacting them. A future Congress could override any decisions made, since one Congress cannot \\"bind another.\\" A variety of watchdog groups, including Public Campaign and MoveOn.org, were concerned that lobbyists would influence the proceedings, and asked that lawmakers disclose meetings with lobbyists and refrain from political fundraising during the selection process. Standard & Poor's was pessimistic at the outset regarding the chance for serious fiscal reform; the agency downgraded the nation's credit rating from AAA to AA+, writing: Analyst Fareed Zakaria predicted the committee would deadlock without a majority favoring a specific plan, writing:  Impasse and failure  The initial proposal from the Democrats on the committee offered 3 trillion in deficit reduction, including 1.3 trillion in new revenue and 400 billion in Medicare savings, but was rejected on partisan lines for the level of tax increases. The Republican Toomey plan proposed 1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, including 300 billion in new revenue, but was rejected because it lowered the top marginal tax rate from 35% to 28%. The final agreement would have needed to undergo a 48-hour vetting period by the Congressional Budget Office before being presented to Congress. After financial markets closed on Monday November 21, 2011, the committee issued a statement that it had failed to reach agreement. This failure despite the extraordinary conditions under which the committee operated was viewed by both sides as a missed opportunity and a triumph of political ideology over genuine leadership. An ORC International poll conducted November 11‚Äì13 reports that 19% of respondents would hold both parties responsible for failure to reach an agreement; 32% of respondents thought Democrats would have a greater responsibility, and 42% Republicans (¬±3%). A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted November 14‚Äì20 indicates that voters blamed the looming impasse on Congressional Republicans 44% to 38% (¬±1.9%) over President Obama and Congressional Democrats. A Gallup poll conducted on November 21 after the announcement finds that 55% apportioned blame equally to the Republicans and the Democrats on the committee, with 24% blaming the Republican members more and 15% blaming the Democratic members more (¬±4%). Committee co-chair Jeb Hensarling blamed Democratic committee members for insisting on \\"a minimum of $1 trillion in higher taxes\\" and unwillingness to agree to \\"structural reforms\\" to health-care entitlement programs. Jon Kyl framed the failure as a question of the scope and size of the government and whether the deficit could best be dealt with by increased taxes or by increased economic growth. Pat Toomey called his proposal a \\"genuine compromise\\" that included increased tax revenues by reforming and simplifying the tax code, as well as spending reductions. The Republican presidential candidates have each stated that deficit reduction should not include any tax increases. Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity celebrated the impasse as preventing a \\"poorly-timed tax hike\\". Republicans have also criticized Obama for his hands-off approach; the president was out of the country during the final week of negotiations. Committee co-chair Patty Murray blamed Republican committee members for insisting that the \\"wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations be protected from paying a penny more\\" at the expense of the middle class. John Kerry put the blame on \\"the Republican insistence on making tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans permanent\\", referring to the Bush tax cuts due to expire in 2013. Nancy Pelosi blamed Republican rejection of a \\"balanced approach\\", and Harry Reid put the point of no compromise on the Republican proposal to privatize Medicare. Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen outlined the likely consequences of sequester to the defense budget, calling on Congressional Republicans to choose between \\"rigid antitax ideology\\" and national defense.  Aftermath  Deficit reduction and the automatic cuts scheduled to take effect in January 2013 were viewed as likely to figure in the 2012 presidential election. President Obama stated that he would veto any attempt by Congress to cancel the $1.2 trillion sequester. These sequestrations figured prominently in the United States fiscal cliff discussions starting in 2012. US financial markets largely anticipated the failure of the committee, leaving little room to fall following the announcement. The Dow was down 2.1% on the day of the announcement, and the NASDAQ and S&P; 500 were each down 1.9%. Yield on ten year treasuries fell to 1.96% on increased demand for stable investments. Credit rating agencies maintained their projections for US sovereign debt. Standard & Poor's affirmed their AA+ rating; the agency had downgraded the country's credit rating in August 2011, citing Congressional resistance to new revenue measures and fears that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 might not be allowed to expire. Moody's affirmed a rating of AAA with a negative outlook. Fitch Ratings affirmed its AAA rating but revised their outlook to negative, citing \\"declining confidence that timely fiscal measures necessary to place U.S. public finances on a sustainable path ... will be forthcoming.\\" Following the announcement that the committee had failed to reach agreement, a group of government watchdog organizations posted an open letter to President Obama and ranking members of Congress calling for the release of committee working documents. It argues that the proposals could serve the public interest by providing a basis for public debate going forward. The group comprised Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Project On Government Oversight, the Sunlight Foundation, the Center for Responsive Politics, Citizens Against Government Waste, The Heartland Institute, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Except for the five public hearings, the committee proceedings comprising the majority of the negotiations and counter-offers will remain sealed for 20 years under current rules.

The ambush was conducted by the Israel Defense Forces' 162nd Division, against the 25th Brigade of the Egyptian army. The Israelis' goal was the destruction of the brigade, which attempted to disrupt the Israeli crossing of the Suez Canal.Elyashiv 2006, p. 166; Elyashiv 2007, p. 134Adan, p. 221. Battle After a string of counterattacks by Egyptian ground forces during the Israeli offensive in the Yom-Kippur War, Israeli Defense Forces were ambitious to put an end to said counterattacks. On October 17, 1973, Israeli forces conducted an ambush against Egyptian tank divisions commanded by Ahmad Halalmi Hassan, whose force consisted of 94 Soviet made T-62's and 40 other armored APC's, as they were advancing towards Israeli occupied territories in the Sinai. The Israeli forces consisted of 14 M60 Patton Tanks, they conducted the ambush by creating an \\"L\\" formation and attacking from a location in which the Egyptian Tank Brigade had not anticipated a hostile presence. Because the Israeli forces were outnumbered in the battle, they used tactics wherein their tanks peeked out over the hill, fired one shot, then descended to take cover from enemy fire, this process would be repeated by every tank in Avraham's contingent. In the end the Egyptian advance was halted suffering heavy losses, whilst the Israeli forces only withstood the loss of three tanks. Outcome In the end the battle was a victory for the Israel Defense Forces, because they had caused heavy losses to the Egyptian Forces and pushed them onto the defensive. This battle is a key turning point in the war.

A rice pounder is an agricultural tool, a simple machine that is commonly used in Southeast Asia to dehull rice or to turn rice into rice flour. The device has similar functionality to a mortar and pestle, but with more mechanical advantage to conserve labor. Rice is dehulled by continually raising and then dropping the heavy head or pestle of the pounder into a block or mortar. Some rice pounders are foot-operated; the head is raised by standing on the handle of the device past its fulcrum (similar to a see-saw). Once raised, the user quickly steps off of the handle, allowing the heavy head to fall into the mortar and pulverize its contents.http://www.thefickeadventure.com/WorldTrip/Thailand/ChiangMai/Day2RicePounder.html In Bengal (West Bengal, India and Bangladesh), this is called Dhenki, and is still used traditionally in the villages for personal use.

Until 1999, it was formerly known as IKIP Surabaya (English: Surabaya Institute of Teaching and Education Sciences) and was established for graduating teachers, qualified for preschool, elementary, junior high, and senior high school. UNESA has seven faculties and one graduate school, 47 undergraduate programs, 12 diploma programs, and 15 postgraduate and doctorate programs. It has approximately 24,986 students and 834 lecturers (244 undergraduates, 470 postgraduates, 76 doctoral, and 27 professors). History In 1950, UNESA was founded from B-I and B-II courses majoring in Chemical Sciences and Exact Sciences to ensure the availability of junior and senior high school teachers.. It used classrooms and laboratories belonging to the Dutch Hogere burgerschool (HBS). In 1957, these B-I courses were grouped into General B-I Courses and Special B-I Courses. The General B-I Courses included English and German languages, while the Special B-I Courses included Chemical Sciences, Exact Sciences, Economics, Technical, Sports, and Aeronautical Sciences. In 1960, the B-I and B-II courses were integrated into Faculty of Education and Teacher Training (Indonesian: Fakultas Keguruan dan Ilmu Pendidikan or FKIP) to graduate advanced school teachers. In 1961, this was absorbed into FKIP Universitas Airlangga Cabang Malang and named FKIP Universitas Airlangga Cabang Surabaya. January 3, 1963, FKIP and the Institute of Teacher Training (founded in 1962) was merged with IKIP Malang Cabang Surabaya. December 19, 1964, IKIP Surabaya was officially established with five faculties: Education, Social Teaching, Language Art Teaching, Exact Science Teaching, and Engineering Sciences Teaching. In 1977, the Faculty of Sports Science Teaching became the sixth. That year, five of the six faculties changed their names to the Faculty of Languages and Art, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Social Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Sport Sciences. Through a Presidential Regulation dated August 4, 1999, IKIP Surabaya changed its name to Universitas Negeri Surabaya. In 2006, UNESA opened a new Faculty of Economics as a separate entity from its parent faculty, Social Sciences. In 2014, UNESA opened two departments, Communication Sciences under the Faculty of Social Sciences, and Islamic Economics under the Faculty of Economics. UNESA has two main campuses in Ketintang and Lidah Wetan, a supporting campus for Department of Extraordinary Education in Gedangan, Sidoarjo, two language centers in Ketintang Campus and Dr. Moestopo, and laboratory schools for education-based programs, including a kindergarten, an elementary school and two middle schools. UNESA is known as an inclusive campus, which means disabled students can study along with the able-bodied students. It has a study and service center for disabled people, and provides assistance for disabled people in Surabaya, especially in the campus.

It is broken down in the body to dapsone, which is the therapeutic form. History The first synthesis of Promin is sometimes credited to Edward Tillitson and B.F. Tuller of Parke, Davis, & Co. pharmaceuticals in August 1937. However, although Parke-Davis did in fact synthesize the compound, it seems certain that they were not the first; in cooperation with J. Wittmann, Emil Fromm synthesised various sulfone compounds in 1908, including both dapsone and some of its derivatives, such as promin. Fromm and Wittmann however were engaged on chemical rather than medical work, and no-one investigated the medical value of such compounds until some decades afterwards. The medical evaluation of sulfones was inspired by the discovery of the unprecedented value of synthetic compounds such as sulfonamides in treating microbial diseases. Early investigations yielded disappointing results, but subsequently promin and dapsone proved valuable in treating mycobacterial diseases. They were the first treatments to show more than a glimmer of hope of controlling such infections.< Initially, Promin appeared to be safer than dapsone, so it was further investigated at the Mayo Clinic as a treatment for tuberculosis in a guinea pig model. Because it was already known that leprosy and tuberculosis were both caused by mycobacteria (Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively), Guy Henry Faget of the National Leprosarium in Carville, Louisiana, requested information about the drug from Parke-Davis. They, in turn, informed him of the work being done on leprosy in rats by Edmund Cowdry at the Washington University School of Medicine. His successful results, published in 1941, convinced Faget to begin human studies, both with promin and sulfoxone sodium, a related compound from Abbott Laboratories. The initial trials were on six volunteers, and were then expanded and replicated in different locations. Despite severe side effects that caused the initial tests to be suspended temporarily, the drug was shown to be effective. This breakthrough was reported worldwide, and led to a reduction in the stigma attached to leprosy, and consequent better treatment of patients, at the time still referred to as \\"inmates\\", and forbidden from using public transport. Pharmacology Promin is heat-stable and water-soluble, and can therefore be heat-sterilized. It can be injected intravenously, and is available in ampules. Beyond its solubility, however, promin was later found to have no real advantages over the simpler compound dapsone (which is administered in tablet form). Promin and other sulfones can also not be used as substitutes for dapsone when intolerance develops, as this is a general reaction to sulfones, and not specific to dapsone. Today, the drugs of choice for treating leprosy are dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine.

His works first appeared in Dzie≈Ñ Akademicki and Civitas Academica. He specialized in medieval German law, taught by professor Stanis≈Çaw Estreicher. In 1929 he was deputy assistant to Estreicher. He travelled all over Europe contributing articles to the leading Polish papers. He joined the editorial board of the newspaper Czas from Krak√≥w, first as a proofreader, then surveying the foreign press, and from 1930, author of a series of reports from Hungary. In 1932 he published his debut book, Sarajewo 1914, Szanghaj 1932, Gda≈Ñsk 193? (Sarajevo 1914, Shanghai 1932, Gda≈Ñsk 193?) about Gda≈Ñsk. In the 1930s he published in the magazine Bunt M≈Çodych (Youth Revolt) and was a member of the young conservatives. He travelled in Palestine in 1933 reporting for the Vilnius weekly S≈Çowo. His book on Palestine was published in October 1933, Palestyna po raz trzeci (Palestine for the Third Time). During the Spanish Civil War in 1936 he was a correspondent in Madrid and supported the Spanish Republican Army, staying at the famous Hotel Florida (Madrid), then also inhabited by the likes of Ernest Hemingway. He wrote about Spain in the book W czerwonej Hiszpanii (In the Red Spain), published in 1937 (translated to Spanish as En la Espa√±a roja in 2007). Before September 1939 he reported from Gda≈Ñsk. His article was published in July 1939 on the first page in the special issue of Wiadomo≈õci Literackie dedicated to Gda≈Ñsk. After September 1939 he fought in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, and served in the Battle of Narvik (Norway 1940), and Battle of Falaise (France 1944). He wrote about Scotland and Poles who came there in the book Polish Invasion, published in October 1941 in London. He was a member of the Polish Embassy staff in Russia (1941‚Äì42). After this experience he wrote the book Russian Year: A Notebook of an Amateur Diplomat, published in May 1944 in New York. During his stay in Russia he experienced such contrasts as a stay in a humble peasant's hut and a dinner in state with Stalin at the Kremlin. The New York Times wrote that Pruszy≈Ñski \\"possesses a knowledge of Russian language, culture and history shared by very few recent foreign visitors to the Soviet Union. Add to this a keenly observant eye, a style that is always readable and sometimes brilliant, and one has the ingredients of one of the most informative books that have appeared on the Soviet Union at war.\\". He wrote about Gda≈Ñsk in 1946 after its destruction and reminisce about pro-war attitude of the citizens of Gda≈Ñsk in 1939. Between 1948-1950 he was a diplomatic representative (pose≈Ç) of PRL in the Netherlands. At that time, he was associated with a Polish poet Julia Hartwig. He died in unexplained circumstances on 13 June 1950 in a car accident in Rhynern, south of Hamm, about 50 miles northeast of D√ºsseldorf. He was buried at Rakowicki Cemetery in Krakow. Married to Maria Meysztowicz, he had three children: Aleksander, Maria and Stanis≈Çaw (Stash). Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski said of Pruszy≈Ñski that thanks to him reportage has become not only the product of the eye, but also of the mind.

It is a Grade II listed building primarily noted for its historical associations. It hosted many mainstream and fringe political and artistic events and after the Second World War was the most popular register office used by high society and celebrities who required a civil marriage. History of the structure Following a design competition set by the parishes of St Margaret and St John, the chosen design was a proposal by William Lee and F.J. Smith in an ornate Francois I style using red brick and pink sandstone, with slate roofs. The foundation stone was laid by the philanthropist, Baroness Burdett-Coutts, on 29 March 1882. The facility, which contained two public halls known as the Great and York Halls, was opened as \\"Westminster Town Hall\\" in 1883.GLA planning report PDU/0583/01 2003 The building ceased to be the local seat of government after the creation of the enlarged City of Westminster in 1900. It was renamed Caxton Hall at that time to commemorate the printer, William Caxton, who had worked almonry of Westminster Abbey. However the halls continued to be used for a variety of purposes including public meetings and musical concerts. A central entrance porch and canopy were added in the mid-20th century, now removed. From 1933 on it was used as a Central London register office and was the venue for many celebrity weddings. This function closed in 1979 and the building stood empty for years getting a place on the Buildings at Risk Register. It was listed as a building of Special Architectural or Historic Interest on 15 March 1984. It was redeveloped as apartments and offices in 2006. The facade and former register office at the front of the building facing Caxton Street were restored and retained being converted into luxury flats (see Facadism). The rear of the building, containing the halls, was demolished and a circular office building, named the Asticus Building, was built on the site.  History of its social and political use  The building was the location of the First Pan-African Conference in 1900. Suffragette meeting at Caxton Hall in 1908, view of the platform. The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), part of the British Suffragette movement, held a ‚ÄòWomen's Parliament‚Äô at Caxton Hall at the beginning of each parliamentary session from 1907, with a subsequent procession to the Houses of Parliament and an attempt (always unsuccessful) to deliver a petition to the prime minister in person. Caxton Hall's central role in the militant suffrage movement is now commemorated by a bronzed scroll sculpture that stands nearby in Christchurch Gardens open space. In 1910 the occultist Aleister Crowley staged his Rites of Eleusis at Caxton Hall. The series of performances took place over six weeks, and received mixed reviews. On 10 October 1925, Harry Pollitt, founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain was married here to Marjorie Brewer. Their best man and witness was Percy Glading, who would later be imprisoned for spying for the OGPU. Suffragette meeting at Caxton Hall in 1908, view of the hall interior. During the Second World War it was used by the Ministry of Information as a venue for press conferences held by Winston Churchill and his ministers. This wartime role is marked by a commemorative plaque unveiled in 1991. In 1940 it was the site of the assassination of Michael O'Dwyer, former Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab in India by Indian nationalist Udham Singh, as an act of revenge for the 1919 Amritsar massacre. It was the location of the press conference that the Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto was released in 1955 in response to the threat of nuclear war and humanity destroying itself. On 12 May 1960, over 1,000 people attended the first public meeting of the Homosexual Law Reform Society. The National Front was formed at a meeting in Caxton Hall, Westminster on 7 February 1967. It was also used as a central London register office for weddings from October 1933 to 1978. Notable people who were married there include; Donald Campbell (two marriages), Harrison Marks, Billy Butlin, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Dors, Peter Sellers, Bernard Bresslaw, Roger Moore, Orson Welles, Joan Collins, Adam Faith, Barry Gibb and Ringo Starr.MoLAS 2004 Report Museum of London Archaeology, Caxton Hall, March 2004 .

The nucleus of the collection was formed out of the collection moved from their college in Tarnopol. It was further expanded with the volumes the Jesuits managed to recover from many locations after the re-establishment of the Order in Europe, and by new purchases and donations. The collection included medieval manuscripts, incunabula, old music prints, collections of the 18th-century maps, rare scholarly and scientific works, academic and school manuals from Jesuit colleges (the oldest from the Jesuit College in Polotsk), from missions (e.g. Minsk) and from Jesuit houses before the suppression of the Society of Jesus.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmoreland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Anne, Thwaites, Holy Trinity, Millom, and St Luke, Haverigg. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is a prominent landmark in the town. History The church was built between 1874 and 1877 to serve the growing town of Millom. It was designed by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. The church cost about ¬£12,000 (), of which ¬£7,186 was given by the Millom Ironworks. The site for the church was given by the Earl of Lonsdale. Architecture Exterior St George's is constructed in red sandstone with ashlar dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan is \\"markedly asymmetrical\\", and consists of a four-bay nave with a north aisle, a central tower with a transept to the north, a south vestry, and a chancel. The nave and the aisle have two-light windows on the sides and three-light windows at the east ends. At the west end, the nave has a five-light window, and the aisle a two-light window. All the windows contain Geometrical-type tracery.

The membership of the Institute is elected on the basis of their academic and professional achievements with Members and Fellows entitled to the postnominal MNEIMME and FNEIMME. The Institutes‚Äô membership is predominately from local industry and from academics at Durham and Newcastle Universities, though members are also located further afield across the UK. The Institute was founded in 1852 in Newcastle upon Tyne, and was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in 1876. The Institute developed one of the largest collections of mining information in the world. Its library, named after the first President Nicholas Wood contains more than twenty thousand volumes of technical literature,North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers The Mining Institute Renaissance - Anniversary Celebrations 1852‚Äì2002. 2002. in the fields of mining, geology, mechanical engineering, government blue books, mine rescue, mineralogy, mineral chemistry, mining statistics, mining law, seismology and other related topics. In 2019 the assets of the Institute - building, library and archive collections and staff - were transferred to a new charity The Common Room of the Great North which intends to 'celebrate the region's engineering history through education and engagement, with a vision to inspire the next generation of innovators and engineers'. The Institute building is closed for refurbishment until Autumn 2020. History Origins and Formation John Buddle The origins of the Institute stem from William Turner, minister of the Hanover Square Chapel,'Protestant Dissent: Chapels and meeting-houses', Historical Account of Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Including the Borough of Gateshead (1827), pp. 370-414. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43362 Date accessed: 07 February 2014 just behind the position of Newcastle railway station. He began Newcastle's first Sunday School, 'a focus of light and learning' for the town. One of his students, John Buddle, became a viewer (mining engineer) and wealthy mine owner, and member of the Literary and Philosophical Society and the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne (now the Natural History Society of Northumbria). Buddle became a major influence on the Durham and Northumberland Coalfield, \\"the King of the Coal Trade\\". In 1816, Buddle devised a system of diverting underground ventilating currents that is in use today. He did not live to see the impact of his legacy, as he died in 1843, nine years before the founding of the Institute.Hiskey, C.E. John Buddle (1773‚Äì1843): agent and entrepreneur on the North-East coal trade. MLitt thesis, University of Durham, 1978.

The committee secured the services of Sir Humphry Davy, inventor of the safety lamp, in 1815. Despite changes, explosions continued, culminating in a devastating explosion at St Hilda Colliery in which 52 persons were killed. The South Shields Committee recommended the introduction of government inspections of mines the education of mechanical engineers, leading to the first Government Inspection Act of 1850., Extracts from the North and South Shields Gazette A coroner's court held at the Mill Inn at Seaham in 1852 suggested it would be advantageous to form a society to consider the prevention of accidents in coal mines. Nicholas Wood statue in the Wood Memorial Hall At a meeting of ‚Äúcolliery owners, viewers, and others interested in the Coal Trade‚Äù on 3 July 1852, it was proposed to form a society to discuss the ventilation of coalmines, prevention of accidents and other items connected with the general working of coalmines. It was to be called \\"The North of England Society for the Prevention of Accidents and for other purposes connected with mining\\", and Nicholas Wood would be chairman.Anderson, Wm. Meeting of Colliery Owners, Viewers, &c; Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining Engineers 1 1852-3,1-2 The title actually adopted was the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, changed in 1870 to North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers.Report of the Rules Committee Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 19 1869-70, 99-100 A committee was appointed to draw up rules and the inaugural meeting was held on 3 September 1852 at which Wood delivered the inaugural address at the lecture theatre of the Literary and Philosophical Society. In this address he gave the aims of the Institute: Wood was president from the Institute's inauguration in 1852 until 19 December 1865 when he died aged 70. A Royal Charter was awarded by Queen Victoria incorporating the Institute in the 28th of November 1876. A School of Medicine founded in 1834, a predecessor of Newcastle University, occupied the site the Institute was built on. It was in this building part of the 1838 British Association meeting was held. The College of Physical Science in Newcastle, linked to Durham University, was founded in 1871 following some years of discussion and promotion by the Institute. Its classes were taught in the Institute's lecture theatre. It was renamed Armstrong College and was for many decades part of the University of Durham, later to become Kings College and then Newcastle University. Similar institutions to the Institute were set up in other parts of Britain and informal collaboration led to the creation in 1889 of the Federated Institution of Mining Engineers, comprising NEIMME; Chesterfield and Midland Counties Institution of Engineers; Midland Institute of Mining, Civil and Mechanical Engineers; South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire Institute of Mining Engineers and later the North Staffordshire Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, the Mining Institute of Scotland and the Manchester Geological and Mining Society. The name was changed to the Institution of Mining Engineers in 1898. The constituent societies kept their identity within the national Institution and many, like NEIMME, exist today as local societies of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. 20th Century Historically the Institute was concerned not just with measures to reduce accidents, but with the theory, art and practice of mining in general. So through meetings, presentation, discussion and publication of research papers, investigations, experimental work, and so on, the Institute tried to fulfil these aims. Working groups were set up, for example on tail ropes;North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers On the haulage of coal: being the report of the committee appointed by the Mining Institute to investigate the subject. 1869 flameless explosives;Kayll, A.C Report of the proceedings of the flameless explosives committee of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers NEIMME, 1896 mechanical ventilators Brown, M Walton Mechanical ventilators: report of the Committee of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers and the Midland Institute of Mining, Civil and Mechanical Engineers Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers 48 1898-99, 171-266; Transactions - Institution of Mining Engineers 17 1898-99, 482-576 and mechanical coal cutting.North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers Report of the committee upon mechanical coal cutting.

Its finances became precarious and by the beginning of the 21st Century its continued existence was in doubt. A working group of the Institute concluded that a widening of its role was needed and suggested it used its heritage and collections as a basis for a programme of training, conference, debates, etc about the future engineering, cultural, infrastructure and so on of the North East.

Institute building Inside the Wood Memorial Hall In early years meetings of the Institute were held in the Literary and Philosophical Society and other local premises, but the need for its own building became apparent. Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson, a colleague and contemporary of Nicholas Wood, was his pupil at Killingworth CollieryDoubleday T. Memoir of the late Nicholas Wood, Esq. Transactions - North of England Institute of Mining Engineers 15 1866, 49‚Äì59. and when Robert Stephenson died in October 1859 he left ¬£2000 to the Institute which started a fund to build its permanent home. In 1867 plans were made and the building constructed in 1869-72 in Grainger's new town on the site of the medical school on land traditionally held by the Dukes of Westmorland, the Nevilles. It comprises the Wood Memorial Hall containing the Library, lecture theatre and other small rooms and Neville Hall which was primarily office space that from the beginning until recently was let to various mining and other organisations, such as the Coal Trade Association, Blyth and Tyne Railway, Freemasons and the Law Society. The architect was Archibald Matthias Dunn, whose father, mining engineer and Mines Inspector Matthias Dunn, had been present at the Institute's inaugural meeting. It was built at the height of the English Gothic Revival and shows a mixture of gothic and Tyneside Classical themes. The Library has high windows and a sky lit barrel-vaulted ceiling - the highest point 39 ft above the floor - with stained glass windows by Cooke of London. It includes a monumental statue of Nicholas Wood mounted on a throne in the setting of an iconstasis. There are other works of art including marble busts of John Buddle and Thomas Forster, the Institute's second president and a carving of the River God Tyne including the Institute motto Moneo et munio - I advise and I protect. The original lecture theatre was replaced by the current one in 1902 designed by local architects Cackett and Burns Dick, and modelled on that at the Royal Institution in London. It features a steep rake of seating constructed from Cuban mahogany and the walls display portraits of all the Institute's Presidents since 1852. Activities Membership and Postnominals The Institute is a Royal Chartered membership organisation with members drawn from local industry and academia. The Institute has particularly good links with Durham and Newcastle Universities and with the local geotechnical industry. The Institutes' higher membership grades are judged upon academic and professional achievements, with unqualified but interested members of the public able to join in the lower category. The membership grades are: * Student * Affiliate * Associate * Member (MNEIMME) * Fellow (FNIEMME) Professional and Public Lectures The Institute has a monthly series of public lectures public lectures on developments in science and technology. These lectures range in topic from current and historical mining projects, active industrial developments with speakers from high-tec manufacturing industries, and cutting-edge research talks given by local PhD students. The Institutes' Younger Members Group arranges lectures and events for under-35s. The Institute also arranges field trips to sites of geological and industrial interest for its members. Many of the Institutes' members have conducted research into the North Pennine Orefield with trips to mines and geological outcrops recorded in its Transactions since the late 1800s to the present day. Partnerships with other Organisations The Institute works with other learned and professional organisations to provide its members and the wider public with lectures and events across a range of disciplines. The Institute is a 'local society' of the IOM3 and runs events promoting the study and research of materials science. The Institute holds an annual joint-lecture with the Geological Society of London on strategic geological topics, and has had links with the Society dating back to the 1800s when the British Association meeting was held in Newcastle. The Institute also holds joint events with the Stephenson Locomotive Society on industrial heritage and transport topics. Library collections and Publishing The collections include books, statistical compendia, Mines Inspectors reports, journals, Government committee reports, archives, tracts, maps, photographs, technical reports, artworks and there is a searchable catalogue.North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers Collections Accessed 30 August 2016. In recent years library material has been transferred to the Institute following the closure of institutions such as the NCB Coal Research Establishment at Stoke Orchard, the NCB Mining Research and Development Establishment at Bretby, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association and the Centre for Lifelong Learning at the University of Newcastle. The Institute regularly publishes articles in its online Transactions on topics ranging from mining engineering and industrial heritage, to materials science and industrial policy. Governance The Institute is governed by a Council - as dictated by the Royal Charter - comprising the President, two Vice Presidents, the Honorary Secretary, the Honorary Treasurer, the immediate fifteen Past Presidents, and members elected from the membership. The current Council is composed of representatives from the local geotechnical industry, academics from Durham University, industrial historians, active exploration geologists, as well as former coal miners from the North East collieries. Other uses of the building In recent years the main hall of the Institute has also been used as a 100-capacity music venue, predominantly by local bands. The space has been described as \\"brilliantly atmospheric\\", and \\"an intimate setting for live music\\". The Mining Institute has also been used as a venue for Home Gathering Festival and is also available for conferences and weddings. The Institute building is currently closed for refurbishment until Autumn 2020.

The once continuous double track main line railway is now operated as a single track east of Ottbergen. It runs through the Egge ridge and along the northern edge of the Solling hills. The section in North Rhine-Westphalia up to and including Holzminden is also known as the Egge Railway (). History  Northern side of Altenbeken station. Brakel station H√∂xter-Ottbergen station The line from Altenbeken to Godelheim was opened on 1 October 1864 by the Royal Westphalian Railway Company and extended on 10 October 1865 to Holzminden. It connected with the Brunswick Southern Railway, which was opened by the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway between Holzminden and Kreiensen on 10 October 1865, creating a link with Brunswick (Braunschweig). To connect with the Brunswick area the line bypassed the town of Einbeck with two tunnels and a long climb. Originally the route was considered a long distance line from the Ruhr to Brunswick and Berlin. The section east of Ottbergen remained a secondary line because after Prussia‚Äôs annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1866 a bypass of Hanover was no longer necessary. The section from Altenbeken to Ottbergen connected with the Solling Railway (Sollingbahn), opened in 1873, and the South Harz Railway (S√ºdharzstrecke), opened 1868‚Äì69, creating an important west-east connection to G√∂ttingen, Halle and Leipzig. The line lost importance because more traffic shifted to the north-south direction over the decades after 1945 as a result of the division of Germany. The most striking construction on the Egge Railway is the 1,631 m long Rehberg Tunnel at Altenbeken. As late as the 1980s there had been for years a continuous long distance express (\\"D-train\\", D-Zug, short for Durchgangszug, literally ‚Äúcorridor train‚Äù) with through carriages that were separated in Altenbeken and continued towards H√∂xter. In the 1990s through trains also ran on the line from Ottbergen to Nordhausen in Thuringia. The Paderborn‚ÄìHolzminden‚ÄìKreiensen service ended with the handover of passenger operations between Paderborn and Holzminden on the line to NordWestBahn in December 2003. The line is now double track between Altenbeken and Ottbergen and between Stadtoldendorf and Vorwohle. Since October 2008 it has been controlled by an electronic interlocking operating from G√∂ttingen. Operations RB Ottbergen‚ÄìKreiensen: BR 614 in the 1990s in Ottbergen station Train to Holzminden in Kreiensen Between December 2003 and December 2013, passengers operations on the line was divided into two sections at Holzminden. The Regionalbahn service RB 84 (Egge-Bahn) ran hourly throughout every day of the week. In Paderborn it became RB 74 Senne-Bahn running to Bielefeld on the Senne Railway. The eastern section was operated every two hours by Deutsche Bahn with Alstom Coradia LINT diesel single-units. Most services continued over the Kreiensen‚ÄìBrunswick line to Bad Harzburg. With the timetable change on 15 December 2013, both services were combined as RB 84 (Paderborn‚ÄìH√∂xter-Ottbergen‚ÄìKreiensen) in the OWL diesel network and operated by NordWestBahn. The service continued over the Paderborn‚ÄìHolzminden section each hour. The section east of Holzminden was only operated every the two hours. The service was operated with Bombardier Talent DMUs able to run at 120 km/h. The route east of Altenbeken is mostly able to be run at 100 km/h. The average speed is 66 km/h. In December 2015, portion working was introduced Ottbergen with an RB 84 service (Kreiensen‚ÄìHolzminden‚ÄìPaderborn) and a RB 85 service (Ottbergen‚ÄìG√∂ttingen). Passengers can now travel from both G√∂ttingen and Kreiensen to Paderborn. To implement the measure H√∂xter-Ottbergen station had to be rebuilt with a storage track and track connections. The implementation of these measures began in September 2014 within the \\"Modernisation Initiative 2\\" (Modernisierungsoffensive 2).

The club was founded in 2010. They play in the Scottish National League and have won the league on four occasions. Home games are played at the Woodside Sports Complex, also known as the Hazlehead Academy.  History  Founded in the summer of 2010 as an U15 team going by the name Bon Accord Bulls, the venture was such a great success that a first team was set up the following February now called the Aberdeen Warriors. The club was formed by Craig Parslow (a former professional rugby league footballer), Thomas Lee and Ray Hall. In their debut season in 2011 the U15 reached their Grand Final while the first team went through their campaign unbeaten eventually beating Moray Titans in the Division 2 final 72-4 earning the club promotion. The following season the club initiated the North player development centre for under-age player groups which was created to coach and aid players in the region. On the field the club ran two domestic teams in the Scottish League, the first team having finished second in Division 1 were beaten in the Grand Final by defending champions Edinburgh Eagles 10-36 while their second team won the North League. 2013 was the year of the Warriors having finished top of the Northern Division they then went and beat the dominant Edinburgh Eagles for the first team 22-20 in the play-off semi-final and in the Grand Final they beat Easterhouse Panthers 30-28 to lift their first major title. 2014 began with a first appearance in the Challenge Cup, as Scottish champions, but they were defeated 4-46 by Pilkington Recs. By the end of that campaign they had retained their title remaining unbeaten after beating Edinburgh Eagles in the final 30-20.http://www.aberdeenwarriors.com/challenge-cup/history.html The following season brought another first round defeat in the Challenge Cup this time against Skirlaugh Bulls but by only 20-27 and a third successive title. In 2016 the title was clinched again this time against Strathmore Silverbacks 48-32 the season had begun with defeat again in the first round of the Challenge Cup against Northumbria University 16-42. 2017 started badly with a heavy defeat in the first round of the Challenge Cup 8-62 against Pilkington Recs.http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/15056279.Challenge_cup_lives_up_to_its_name_for_hosts_at_tournament_kick_off_in_Aberdeen/?ref=ar.html  Challenge Cup  Following on from their win in the Scottish Grand final in 2013, the club were invited to take part in the Challenge Cup for the first time. Drawn away in the first round of the 2014 Challenge Cup against Pilkington Recs, the Warriors lost 4-46. The following years also brought first round exits. In 2015 they were beaten at Skirlaugh Bulls 20-27, by far their best performance, in 2016 they lost at home to Northumbria University 16-42 played at Rubislaw and in 2017 they were heavily beaten at home against Pilkington Recs 8-62.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/challenge- cup/results.html  Honours  * Scottish National League (4): 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 * Scottish Division 2 (1): 2012  See also  * Rugby league in Scotland * List of rugby league competitions  References  External links Aberdeen Warriors on Scotland Rugby League Category:Rugby League Conference teams Category:Rugby League Conference Category:Rugby league in Scotland Category:Sport in Aberdeen Category:Rugby clubs established in 2010 Category:Scottish rugby league teams Category:Defunct rugby league teams Category:2010 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Aberdeen Warriors"},{"id":"32527061","text":"The 1922 LFF Lyga was the 1st season of the LFF Lyga football competition in Lithuania.

Diggers family Gina Diggers Archaeologist, super- scientist, and adventurer; lover of all things Monty Python, Roddenberry and Lucas. After many years exploring the bizarre and inexplicable all over the Earth and off it, she now teaches archaeology at a local university in her home in Atlanta, Georgia, preparing the next generation of adventurers. Her current project is Earth's Age of Wonders. Britanny \\"Gia\\" Diggers  Gina's \\"baby sister\\" and Earth's last full-blooded were-cheetah. Adopted as an infant by Gina's father, Brit has accompanied Gina on most of her adventures as an assistant and bodyguard, even if (most times) she would rather have been exploring high-end clothing stores at the mall. Brittany has also settled down (some) to be a doting wife, loving mother, and kick-ass martial arts instructor. Brianna Diggers Part Gina, part Brittany, and all trouble. Brianna blends Gina's technical brilliance and Brit's physical prowess with an unsettling helping of weapons mania. Her innate, semi-instinctive talent for magic can be a mixed blessing, but it sure comes in handy when she runs out of ammo. Brianna has started to learn aura magic under her father, and helps to design equipment for her friends in the Vaultron Force on the side. She marries Zan after learning she is pregnant with his child. Theodore Diggers Gina's arch-mage father. Theodore adopted Brittany after he failed to stop the slaughter of the were-cheetah clan. While his attempts to teach his daughter Gina his own magic arts resulted in failure, he helped her start into her discovery of science and technology where she excelled. Since then, he has watched both his daughters grow up, though not without occasionally terrifying their potential boyfriends. Julia Diggers Gina's mother, and a master martial artist, but Julia was under a spell which made her unable to visit Earth, or interact with her family during most of Gina's childhood. Gina and Brianna eventually removed the curse, and since then she has re-earned her title of Armsmaster of Jade, as well as becoming a master of the Shun-Leep style of martial arts, starting her own school on Earth. Stryyp'Gia Brittany's husband, and the crown prince of the alien Kryn species, who arrived on Earth and founded El Dorado long ago. Due to a misunderstanding, El Dorado and Atlantis had been locked in a cold war for centuries. After an Atlantean sorcerer enslaved the inhabitants, Stryyp (also called Stripe, as his name sounds like stripe, and his pelt is striped) freed his people with the help of Gina and Brittany. He and Brittany have a daughter, Tiffany, and Stryyp himself works for Agency Zero, an undercover organization manned by former superheroes who now perform their good deeds discreetly and anonymously for better efficiency, and to make themselves into less of an open target. Tiffany 'Gia Tiffany inherited her mother's were-cheetah powers and new symbiots replicated from her father's. She also spent her early life being educated by a living world-computer, and has developed into a genuine prodigy. Though mature for her age, she is still very much a little girl. Her symbiots help her process information and protect her from harm. Her recently manifested were-cheetah abilities are likely to make her more powerful than her mother some day. Peebos Cute, goofy, childlike, self-aware, technomage bombs, without common sense, invented by Brianna Diggers by unconsciously combining golem magic with advanced artificial intelligence. Brianna eventually adopted the three most advanced models as children. Peebri, Peegi, Peebrit, are each modeled after Brianna, Gina, and Brittany, respectively, so by raising them, Brianna can picture what it would have been like if she grew up with her sisters. As such they have a relatively free rein and are encouraged to learn for themselves, but unfortunately Peebri's antics are often destructive and/or silly, although highly amusing. The Peebos have starred in their own spin-of miniseries, where the less advanced series models occasionally guest star.  Zan  A wild man and Ebenezer Sleake's assistant. He entered a relationship with Brianna ad married her after discovering she was pregnant with his child. Friends and allies Penny Pincer Gina's one-time rival and sometime partner, Penny is one of the few people who can go head-to-head with Gina on matters academic and archaeological. Both are equally intelligent, though with some different specialties. She's quite territorial over her relationship with Kevin \\"Ace\\" Koss, Gina's longtime friend and transport provider. She married Ace and is pregnant with his child. Kevin \\"Ace\\" Koss Gina's longtime friend, transport provider, and fellow adventurer, Ace is capable of piloting just about anything that flies. He is also boyfriend/fianc√© to Gina's ex-rival, Penny Pincer. He knows Penny is right for him, but had difficulty facing the commitment level of marriage, but they eventually wed. Charlotte A harpy, originally bioengineered as a mindless slave to the villainous Alfred Peachbody, Charlotte was quickly freed from his influence and adopted by Penny to train as her bodyguard. Penny has come to care for Charlotte as a surrogate mother, and her protege has advanced and proven herself several times over. Charlotte has progressed to an early teenager mentality, is constantly learning new advanced science at school, is best friends with Brittany's daughter Tiffany, and the two have many fun adventures together. Seance Theodore's apprentice and one of Gina's common adventuring partners. Seance is able to see the daydreams and mental visualizations of others, and to communicated and channel the spirits of the dead. Though he originally was interested in Gina, he eventually initiated a relationship with Genn. Gennadrid A half-djinni-half-rakshasa, and daughter of Madrid (although in practice a much less harmful form of succubus), Genn can mimic the form and abilities of anyone she has encountered, and originally used it for seduction purposes, as she needed to feed on ethereal energy to survive. She is one of Brianna's best friends, and former lover, but grew attracted to Seance due to his high magical ether levels, and fell in love with his kind personality. As Seance is heterosexual, she removed her ability to assume male forms to accommodate him, and the two are currently married Madrid Formerly the spoiled princess of the Djinni, Madrid once sought the power to grant her own wishes. To get it, she disguised herself as Gina and tried to kill off the real one. The disguise was too perfect; Madrid was now mortal and gradually came to resemble Gina more and more in body and mind. A traumatic experience caused what was left of Madrid's personality to give up and die, leaving only a copy of Gina's mind with Madrid's memories. Now she seeks to explore other worlds and work out her new life. Ancient One A Nomad Artificer who is a possible future version of Madrid, who was thrown into the distant past before the formation of the present universe. She has been manipulating events in order to save the universe from the threat that banished her into the past, and reunite with her family, the Diggers. Dao Madrid's fellow Djinn and ex-husband. Ever since Gina's group found his focus (an iron pot) and brought it home, he has put his natural intelligence and creativity to work as Gina's lab assistant. He has also become smitten with her, both physically and mentally, gradually assuming a form that blend elements of the men to whom Gina responds most positively. He and Madrid have reconciled and are dating. Gar Silvear A were-jaguar from the magical world of Jade, Gar apprenticed under Gina's mother, Julia when he was a young teen, becoming like a son to her. She even tried to hook him up with Gina's sister Brittany. When Julia became a Shun-Leep master, Gar left the Northern Edge-Guard to be her student on Earth, and he is her most advanced pupil. Gar retained some infatuation with Brit‚Äô even after she married, but has slowly been developing a relationship with his fellow student Luan Geas. His full name is Garfield. Sheila Silvear A were-jaguar who is the younger sister of Gar and also a member of the Northern Edge-Guard. Sheila has a defect where all the size, power and measurements commonly associated with the hybrid form is present in her human form, while her hybrid form is short and underdeveloped. This has led her to occasionally be mistaken for a child, which her tendency to refer to any kind of physical punishment as a 'kapowie' doesn't help with. Luan Geas A former spy/assassin from Jade, whose parents were murdered by the undead knight Rook, Luan trained with her friend Carla at the Shun-Leep school, where they founded a fan club for its most famous graduate, Julia Diggers. Luan began falling in love with Gar when they had to work together to help Julia regain her title and honor. During that adventure, she and Carla were assigned to study under Julia on Earth. She is almost as skilled as Gar, but has less control. Carla Deltoya Another Shun-Leep student from Jade, who is very baffled by the technological wonders that most take for granted, the prudish Carla is currently testing her skills in Earth's Universal Fighter Federation circuit alongside Ayane \\"Mistress\\" Anno, under the circuit alias of \\"Desire\\". Vaultron Force A group of five leprechauns, with code names based on the shapes seen in General Mills Lucky Charms cereal. They pilot cybernetic shoes, which together form the robot Vaultron. The squad is led by McKeith and Princess O'Lura, who designed the robots. O'Lura also designed Plasma Ballerina and Nemesis Shamrock, which can combine with Vaultron to form even more powerful 'giant' (to a leprechaun, anyway) robots; such as the full combination, Super King Kamehameha Vaultron. The Vaultron Force has clashed with the Uompa-Luompan prince Lowtor and his Snacktekons, his chocolate golem Dupity-Doom (a parody of the original Megatron), and even the Ninja-Pirate Leprechauns, and their Gaolion ship. The similarity of these names to Voltron, Keith, Princess Allura, and the Oompa-Loompas is undeniable. Subtracto Subtracto is a Nomad Artificer, a race of machine-intelligences predating the universe, although he seems to believe that he is a mere Artificer construct. Found in the Astral Rifts by Empress Lynn of Shangri-La, he befriended and helped her get back to Earth. After a reformed Madrid was rescued and brought to Shangri-La to recover, he befriended her as well, and now explores the Astral Rifts with her. KIA Kia is the artificial intelligence guiding a fortress-ship of the Dynasty of Stars, a race that terrorized much of the galaxy ages ago. Kia was left behind in quasi-space, the \\"ocean\\" between dimensions, when the Dynasty departed there. After Kia befriended Gina and her sister Brit‚Äô, he transported them back to Earth. He then settled into a parking orbit over the dark side of the Moon to sort things out. D'Bra D'Bra, or Debra as she is sometimes called, is the princess of the dragon race, and the daughter of Dreadwing. A fact no one holds against her. She is a member of Agency Zero. Enemies Dreadwing Gina's first and deadliest major foe, Dreadwing is an ancient and superhumanly intelligent iron dragon driven by calculating malice and ambition. To stop his conquest of time, Gina rigged his Time Raft artifact to explode, and he was blown into the time stream. Pulled back to Earth's ancient past by another of her enemies, Dreadwing embarked on the construction of a model of the Universe, with which he could manipulate reality and gain revenge. Summoner A living magic artifact, Summoner can create an infinite number of living spells which all share a mental link. For a time Summoner believed that she was a human supervillain (the 'multiple-woman' Array), during which time she fell in love with the hero-turned-villain, Tyrant. When her love was killed during a rescue gone bad, a grieving Summoner unleashed her full power to destroy the one who killed him, but she was subdued and left behind in a collapsing pocket dimension. Dreadwing commandeered her after everyone else left, and she currently serves as the lynch pin of his assembled forces. She is rather bitter about her current service, as Dreadwing shows her little respect, a fact that could come back to haunt him soon... Rio Patriarch of the Dynasty Of Stars, a family that turned against the rest of their kind (the peaceful Gardener race) over a horrible misunderstanding and resulting, equally horrible overreaction. He led a crusade that resulted in the virtual extinction of the rest of his species, as well as the conquest of most of the known universe until trickery caused the Dynasty to flee into Quasi-Space, billions of years ago. Rio is highly intelligent, immensely powerful, and experienced. He views 'lesser' species as fodder for the Soul Furnaces to make the armies of warrior-drones that serve his Dynasty, but species that possess a certain level of prowess can earn a sort of respect, though he will still enslave them. Stryyp's people, the Kryn, were one such species, whom Rio regarded as \\"the Heroes' Tribe.\\" Roxy \\"Dark Bird\\" Rabinowitz The hardbitten leader of Night Flight, the world's premiere mercenary team. Dark Bird's hated Ace ever since he blithely proved himself a better pilot than her or any of her team, and routinely foiled both their missions and her attempts to bring him down. Dark Bird speaks with a distinctive New York accent (referring to herself as 'Dark Boid' for instance) and is a highly aggressive pilot, willing to go to rather petty lengths over a grudge such as the one she holds against Ace. She has led Night Flight from their aerial aircraft carriers, Gull Base (essentially a massive jumbo jet) and later, Gull Wing (similar to an even-larger-than-Gull-Base stealth fighter/bomber in shape), though she will also take to the skies in her own jet to lead from the front. Skipper Von Richthofen Chirpy and helpful, Skippy hardly seems like an air mercenary, but it apparently runs in the family. She has had a crush on Ace since she first saw him, and Dark Bird has convinced her that the only way to win Ace's heart is to beat him in air combat. Skippy may just have the skills to do it, too. She's a better pilot than Dark Bird, and at least Ace's equal. Natasha Volstov The Queen of the Vampires, Natasha rules most of the Realm of the Undead. Her first encounter with Gina involved unseating Gina's grandfather, then the Lich King, who had taken over Natasha's throne. Proud, selfish, and hedonistic, Natasha very much enjoys her power and position and sorely resents any threat to them.  Alfred Peachbody  A supersmart dog from an alternate future. He created Charlotte and attempted to sterilize Theodore and Julia in the past, but was foiled by Brianna. He eventually merged with Dreadwing. Pirate-Ninja Leprechauns *Captain McMorgan: The Leprechaun McMorgan was a Harward-educated idealist until he took the fall for a billion-dollar swindle pulled by the Leprechauns‚Äô arch- enemy, Prince Lowtor. When he was exiled, the King's elder daughter, O‚ÄôMommah, went with him. They and a trio of disaffected ninjas formed a pirate band to earn back the lost gold and get vengeance on Lowtor. McMorgan captains the Gaollion, a four-mode robot designed by O‚ÄôMommah. *O‚ÄôMommah: Elder daughter of the Leprechauns‚Äô King Shamus, O‚ÄôMommah is a brilliant technomagical engineer. She frequently clashed with her father over freedom to create vs. the potential harm her creations might cause. Fond of her father's financial advisor, McMorgan, she abandoned her throne to go with him when he was framed for embezzlement and exiled. She became the first mate of his pirate-ninja crew. *Platinus: Platinus is a magend, a living spell, unwittingly created by the living Enigma known as Summoner. Bonded to the dragon Fauntleroy, she is extremely powerful and loyal, but is also highly perverted, readily distracted by masculine physiques. Unknown to her master and his wives, Platinus developed full sentience. Were they to learn of this, she fears they would take it from her. As much as she adores her master, she will not sacrifice her soul for him. *Lulubell: A former Hair Loss Fairy (easier work than a Tooth Fairy, but less pleasant and totally thankless), Lulubell was finally motivated to do more with her life when she hooked up with a musical mage named Spellvis. Her one big caper with him landed her a spell of singing Jailhouse Rock. She keeps hoping her spellcraft and knowledge of magical items will make him her hunka burnin‚Äô love, but as far as Spellvis is concerned, she can take a walk down Lonely Street.

Until 1968 Rhynern was the administrative center of Amt Rhynern. Overview It has 18,578 inhabitants. The town is predominantly rural-agrarian and lies off the Bundesautobahn 2 on European route E34, south of the town of Westt√ºnnen. The L669 road connects it to villages Wambeln and Scheidingen in the south and the K10 road connects it to the village of Ostt√ºnnen two miles to the northeast. It lies on the Hamm- Soest Railway. Rhynern is located in the heart of Westphalia. Its coordinates based on the old village church are 51¬∞ 37' 47.8\\" N, 7¬∞ 51' 29.2\\" E, it is calibrated to 92.96 m above sea level. The oldest written reference is found in approximately the year 1000 in a manuscript, which is located in the State Archives of M√ºnster. In 1302 it fell into possession of the Bishops of Munster. During the French occupation in the 19th Century the office was created in 1808 named Rhynern Mairie. After restoration of the Prussian province of Westphalia, it remained in place.

He was born in Tipperary, the son of Richard Prendergast Vowell, was educated there and served in the Irish militia from 1858 to 1860. In 1862, he came to British Columbia, travelling to Cariboo, where he tried his hand at mining to little avail. Vowell then moved to Victoria, staying there until 1866 and subsequently moving to Big Bend. He was named chief constable there, serving in that post until 1872, when he was named gold commissioner and stipendiary magistrate for the Kootenay district. In 1873, he was transferred to Omineca in the same position; then, in 1874, he was sent to Cassiar. He resigned his post in autumn of that year. Vowell resigned his seat in the assembly after he was named gold commissioner and stipendiary magistrate for Cassiar. In 1884, he was transferred to Kootenay. Vowell resigned these posts in 1889 after being named superintendent of Indian Affairs for British Columbia, a federal position. In 1898, he was also assigned the duties of Indian Reserve Commissioner after the retirement of Peter O'Reilly. During Vowell's tenure, in 1907, British Columbia rejected the allocation of any additional land to native reserves. Vowell resigned his federal positions in March 1910. He died in Victoria at the age of 79.

Patel had his first blogging gig at Gapers Block, a Chicago-centric blog. He was offered a full-time job at Engadget in 2008. After serving at Engadget, he left in 2011 and went on to work for The Verge. In 2014 he left The Verge to join sister site Vox, but later returned to The Verge to become its new editor-in-chief, replacing Joshua Topolsky. Education In 2003, Patel obtained a degree in Political Science from the University of Chicago and in 2006 received his J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School. Career Patel spent four years at Engadget where he was responsible for blogging. SAY Media named Patel one of the 10 \\"Voices that matter\\" in technology journalism. Throughout his career, he has appeared on NHK, G4TV, and TWiT, among many others. Patel is also a co- host for The Vergecast.

It lies in the South Ayrshire Council Area, lying on the hill above Joppa, between Gallowhill and Lochend Farm. History The loch The main outflow drainage pipe. Lochend Loch was a post-glacial 'Kettle Hole' lying within a substantial depression and fed by the relatively minor flow of the Joppa Burn, field runoff and rainfall, its outflow running into the Water of Coyle as the Barwhey or Barquey Burn. A small islet is indicated on the early OS maps, no longer shown when the loch level was lowered in the late 1890s or early 1900s. Roy's map of 1747 shows the then sizeable loch with a roughly circular islandBlaeu Map Retrieved : 2011-07-25 near the centre of the loch; the outflow joined the Water of Coyle near Coyle bridge. Armstrong's map of 1775 shows the loch. The OS maps suggest that the water flow could be controlled so as to set the level of the loch. OS maps also show that the size has been greatly reduced and in 2011 only a small area of open water survives, surrounded by wetland with no significant outflow remaining. The main drain sets the present water level and the previous ditch is now infilled for part of its length with a pipe within it. The height differential between the present outflow and the presumed natural overflow is illustrated by the 'fossilised' loch shore features. A quoted depth of 4.3 m or 14 ft for the early 19th century is reflected by this evidence.The New Statistical Account, p. 662 Although the old lochs outflow passes close to the site of the now demolished Bridgend Cottages, no evidence of a watermill survives. Natural history of the site Reed canary grass, wild angelica, and sedge dominated habitat at the loch margin. The loch is eutrophic and is surrounded by a wide wetland margin that dries out progressively towards the surrounding pastures. Animals found at the site include willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) are present, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), meadow brown, (Maniola jurtina), and small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae). Plants found include typical wetland species such as sedges, willows, and rushes. Hedge woundwort is plentiful, as are wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris) is plentiful, as are Hedge woundwort (Stachys sylvatica), yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), and reed canary grass, (Phalaris arundinacea). The open water area exhibits yellow pond-lily (Nuphar lutea). Wild angelica, reedmace (bullrush), yellow meadow vetchling, Yorkshire fog grass, tussock grass, and meadowsweet were also noted and Brooklime speedwell grows within the ditch of the Joppa Burn inflow. Sundrum Castle The loch was not an ornamental feature of the grounds in the immediate vicinity of Sundrum Castle, however it lies quite close by. Duncan Wallace, son of Sir Robert Wallace and related to Sir William Wallace, commissioned the building of the present castle in the 1360s. The castle passed to Sir Alan de Cathcart before 1384 as Sir Duncan died without an heir. The estate remained in the hands of the Cathcart family seat until 1753, when it was sold by the 9th Lord Cathcart to John Murray of Broughton. The Hamilton family purchased it within a year, and it remained with them until 1917, when it was sold to Mr. Earnest Coats, a director of the Paisley firm of thread manufacturers. In 1936, Sundrum was sold to a hotel syndicate and later the castle fell into disrepair before being restored again in recent times.Sundrum Castle Retrieved : 2011-07-25 Uses Wildfowl shooting hide or butt In the 19th century Lochend Loch was used for curling and probably ice skating. St. Quivox v Coylton is recorded for 20 January 1820 and again on 9 January 1862, both times playing for the Coylton medal.Curling Retrieved : 2011-07-23 The presence of a small island is indicative of its use for breeding and hunting wildfowl and it is likely to have been used for fishing as fish were present.Ayrshire Roots Retrieved : 2011-07-25 The site in 2011 had waterfowl shooting hides and feeding areas for pheasants. Light grazing was noticeable up to the fence around the open water. Areas of old lochshore - northern end. Micro history The loch lay on the lands of Gallowhill Farm, part of the Sundrum Castle estate. The term gallowhill may refer to the site of the feudal barony gallows. The death sentence was hanging for men; women were drowned.

It was based on a blue passenger carriage, Eit 23018, which was fitted with two diesel engines taken from HKL buses 601 and 608. The train had 80 no-smoking seats and had the driver selling tickets, which was unusual for Finnish conditions. During testing, it was run under the nomenclature KOEMV 9991 (from the Finnish koemoottorivaunu, experimental multiple unit), transporting Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in Savonia in May 1994. First accounts were positive, citing that the ride was silent and comfortable. During the summer of 1995 the Dm10 was branded Ilja Repin Express. It was used as an art train, bringing customers to an exhibition of Repin's art at Retretti Art Centre from Punkaharju and Savonlinna. It was also driven on select Saturdays to Rantasalmi. The unit was finally used in regular service for only three years, 1994 to 1997, mostly in regional traffic in Eastern Finland before being withdrawn. The train had problems with its brakes and VR expected it to be cheaper to buy new DMUs instead of converting old carriages for an expected service time of only 15 years. The train was scrapped in 2006 by Kuusakoski Oy. The nickname of the Dm10 is Junttilan Salama (Finnish for \\"Redneck land lightning\\").

Whitworth was instrumental in the founding of the National Theatre, and served the committee lobbying for this as its secretary. Though not an actor, he was praised by George Bernard Shaw as one of the most important figures in the history of British theatre. The library he assembled is a large and important collection, now held at the Theatre Museum at Covent Garden. From 1919 until 1948, Whitworth edited the League's magazine, Drama.

The album features eight tracks, with lyrics penned by Vaali, Gangai Amaran, and Niranjan Bharathi. Following a number of postponements, it was finally released on 10 August 2011 by Sony Music India. The soundtrack was described as a \\"m√©lange of techno, melody, a couple of duets and a mass song\\". The album features eight tracks, including one Theme music track and one club mix. The first track of the album, \\"Vilaiyaadu Mankatha\\" was launched as a single release in mid-May 2011, three months prior to the soundtrack release. Production In mid-October 2010, during Navratri, Yuvan Shankar Raja started composing the first tunes for the film. The \\"introduction song\\" of Ajith Kumar, \\"Vilaiyaadu Mankatha\\", for which he had taken \\"special care\\", and the item number song \\"Machi Open The Bottle...\\", labelled as a \\"mass song\\", were recorded first. In March 2011, sources claimed that a song titled \\"Vaada Bin Lada\\" was recorded with Krish and Suchitra, which was called a \\"funky techno duet\\" and referred to as the \\"present day version\\" of the song \\"Sorgame Endralum\\", while Yuvan Shankar Raja described it as a \\"futuristic duet\\". The song's basic tune was based on the Carnatic raaga Madhuvanti. Later that month, Venkat Prabhu made an announcement via Twitter, disclosing that the soundtrack album would consist of nine tracks, including one promotional track, one theme music track and one club mix, further adding that six songs had been composed and three out of them recorded already.https://twitter.com/dirvenkatprabhu/status/47194915934978048 The remaining songs were recorded from mid-June only, with Yuvan Shankar Raja informing the following month, that he had scrapped one of the songs, since he was not satisfied with its tune, and composed a new song, starting from scratch. Reports in July 2011 revealed that the album would feature two more duets; \\"Nee Naan\\", which was sung by S. P. B. Charan and Yuvan Shankar Raja's sister, Bhavatharini, while Madhushree and Yuvan Shankar himself had sung the other one titled \\"Nanbane\\". The song \\"Nee Naan\\" was revealed to be the replacement for the scrapped song, which Yuvan Shankar Raja had composed within ten minutes of time, with the composer going to pick that song as his favorite from the album. Karthik and Vijay Yesudas had performed another song in the album, titled \\"Balle Lakka\\", which also features vocals of Anusha Dhayanidhi, wife of producer Dayanidhi Azhagiri, debuting as a playback singer. She was persuaded into playback singing by Venkat Prabhu who had seen her performing on her wedding reception and was impressed by her voice. The planned promotional track was excluded from the album in last minute. Earlier reports suggesting that one of the song would feature Yuvan Shankar along with his father Ilaiyaraaja's vocals, and that Andrea Jeremiah had sung another song, turned out to be false. Further Venkat Prabhu disclosed that S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Shankar Mahadevan were approached to render one number in vain, with the former declining, explaining that the song was too high-pitched for his voice, and the latter being unavailable. The \\"Machi Open The Bottle...\\" song and the club mix of \\"Vilaiyaadu Mankatha\\" were notably orchestrated by Venkat Prabhu's brother Premji Amaran. The theme music was revealed to be inspired from a song by 50 Cent, with Prabhu and Yuvan Shankar adding that due credits had been given in the film. Besides, Vaali and Gangai Amaran, who usually write lyrics for Venkat Prabhu's films, renowned poet Subramanya Bharathi's great great grandson, Niranjan Bharathi had penned one song (\\"Nee Naan\\"), becoming his first work in a feature film. The music rights were sold to Sony Music Entertainment who had reportedly offered 1 crores. Release The release of the soundtrack album was initially scheduled for 1 May 2011, coinciding with Ajith Kumar's birthday, but had to be postponed to mid-May, which too was missed, with the launch being pushed back to June. With the filming getting further delayed and the recording of the remaining songs not being completed yet, the projected release date of June had to be changed as well and Venkat Prabhu announced the new date as 18 July, which however was not approved by producer Dhayanidhi. The master CD was eventually handed over to Sony Music on 22 July 2011,https://twitter.com/dirvenkatprabhu/status/94104319502204929 which fixed the release date for 10 August 2011. Since Ajith Kumar informed that he wouldn't attend any promotional events of his films, producer Dhayanidhi Azhagiri dropped the idea of a grand release function. The album was eventually released in a \\"soft launch\\" at the Chennai station of Radio Mirchi during the breakfast show Hello Chennai, with Venkat Prabhu, Yuvan Shankar Raja, Vaibhav, Mahat and Ashwin being present. All the tracks from the album were premiered on the channel and played repeatedly, with the event being simultaneously aired across Radio Mirchi's stations in Coimbatore and Madurai. Two days later, a press meet was arranged at a preview theatre in Saligramam, Chennai and a special screening of two songs and the trailer was held. Response The album received overwhelming response, as did the release function itself, with reportedly over 7 lakh listeners having tuned into Radio Mirchi during the premiere. While the single track, \\"Vilaiyaadu Mankatha\\", had been declared a \\"smash hit\\" even before, the full album had achieved record breaking sales, with the associate director of Sony Music India South, Ashok Parwani, noting in a press release that Sony Music had registered a pre- booking of 60%.

It was written by Tom MacRae and was directed by Nick Hurran. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) takes his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) to the planet Apalapucia for a holiday, but they find that the planet is on quarantine as the two-hearted natives are susceptible to a deadly plague. Amy accidentally gets separated from the Doctor and Rory but when they try to rescue her they arrive 36 years later in her timeline. The older Amy does not trust the Doctor, who is forced to remain on the TARDIS as he also has two hearts, and will not allow the Doctor and Rory to leave and rescue her at the correct point in her timeline. Gillan played the older version of herself and prosthetics were applied to make her appear older. The episode was filmed on a lower budget, and MacRae decided to make the main sets all white in colour. \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" was seen by 7.6 million viewers in the UK and received positive reviews from critics. Plot The Eleventh Doctor takes Amy and Rory on a holiday to the planet Appalapachia, unaware that the planet is suffering from a fatal plague that affects beings with two hearts including the Doctor and can kill them within a day. The population has created \\"kindness facilities\\", where those infected by the plague are placed in one of several thousand accelerated time streams, allowing them to live out their lives whilst in communication with their loved ones through a large glass lens in the waiting room. On their arrival, Amy is separated from the Doctor and Rory, and becomes stuck in an accelerated time stream. As the Doctor and Rory discover Amy's location, they are approached by one of the facility's \\"Handbot\\" robots. The Handbot explains the plague, and failing to recognise the Doctor or Rory as alien, attempts to administer medicine that is fatal to them. The Doctor uses the glass lens to warn Amy of this, and tells her to wait for him in the facility, promising to rescue her. The Doctor locks onto Amy's time stream. The Handbots, as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience The Doctor, unable to leave the TARDIS due to the plague, gives Rory the lens, his sonic screwdriver, and a pair of glasses through which the Doctor can see and communicate with Rory. Rory explores the complex, and finds an older and bitter Amy, who has been waiting to be rescued for 36 years while hiding from the Handbots. The Doctor realises they have mistakenly latched onto the wrong time stream, and urges the older Amy to help find her younger self. She refuses, knowing that if the younger Amy is rescued, she will cease to exist. The Doctor warns him that by taking the older Amy aboard the TARDIS, they will forgo any chance of rescuing the younger Amy. The younger Amy convinces the older Amy to change her mind by asking her to consider Rory. The older Amy agrees to help if the Doctor would take her too. The Doctor temporarily brings the two Amys into the same time stream. Rory takes the younger Amy into the TARDIS. Once they are inside, the Doctor slams the door before the older Amy can enter and admits that it is impossible for both Amys to exist in the same time stream. Rory and the older Amy say goodbye at the TARDIS door before the older Amy tells him to move on without her. Continuity The episode title \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" is a reference to Amy having waited 12 years (and later 2 more years) for the Doctor to return to her in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". When describing the facilities in the Two Streams Facility, the interface says they have a replica of the amusement park at Disneyland on Clom. The planet Clom was first mentioned in \\"Love and Monsters\\" as the home planet of the Abzorbaloff and the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius. Production Karen Gillan volunteered to portray the older version of her character Amy Pond. Tom MacRae, the writer of the episode, had previously written the two-parter \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\"/\\"The Age of Steel\\" for the second series, which featured the return of the Cybermen. As bringing back the Cybermen had limited plot opportunities and put MacRae in the \\"second seat\\" as a writer, he was pleased that he had the opportunity to do whatever he wanted. MacRae was proud of the finished script, calling it his \\"most accomplished piece of plotting ever\\". The original title of the episode was \\"The Visitors' Room\\". This was changed to \\"Visiting Hour\\" and then \\"Kindness\\". The episode, contrary to some reports, was never at any point titled \\"The Green Anchor\\". \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" is a title that has been used to refer to Amy after she waited 12 years for the Doctor to return in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". Executive producer Beth Willis insisted that Amy's speech about how Rory was the most beautiful man she had ever met make it into the final version. \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" is designed as an episode in which the actor playing the Doctor is not required for much of the shooting ‚Äî these have become known as \\"Doctor Lite\\" episodes. Established with the second series episode \\"Love & Monsters\\" because of the production schedule, it has become a tradition that continued with episodes such as \\"Blink\\". MacRae enjoyed exploring Amy and Rory's characters and their past, as the Doctor was \\"always to a certain extent mythic\\" which limited what could be explored with his character. In one draft of the script, the scene near the end in which Rory and the two Amys race to the TARDIS did not include Rory in person; he was watching the scene from the lens. It also included a sequence that featured a Handbot's hand being cut and continuing to walk by itself. With \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" being a lower-budget episode, MacRae wrote for the sets to be entirely white, and described the sets as \\"big white boxes\\". He was pleased with the way it turned out, feeling that the all-white added a \\"really interesting visual sense to it\\". The original idea was to have an older actress play the older Amy, but Karen Gillan volunteered to play the older version of her character with the aid of prosthetics. It was also decided that having Gillan play both characters would be more believable. Gillan developed different body-language, vocal range and attitude for the new individual, whose character has changed after being left behind and in danger. To achieve this, Gillan studied with a voice coach and movement coach. Gillan also wore padding which affected her movement, and stated she spent \\"hours in make-up\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 10 September 2011 and on the same date in the United States on BBC America. Overnight viewing figures showed that it was watched by six million viewers on BBC One, which was an improvement of 0.5 million from the previous episode. The episode was also at the number one spot on BBC's iPlayer, as reported the day after it aired. The episode later topped the iPlayer chart for September. Final consolidated ratings showed a time- shift increase of 1.6 million, bringing the total up to 7.6 million viewers, up 530,000 viewers on the previous episode, \\"Night Terrors\\". The episode received an Appreciation Index of 85, placing it in the \\"excellent\\" category. Critical reception The episode has received critical acclaim. Dan Martin of The Guardian said that it contained \\"the series' most tearjerking suckerpunch so far\\" and the \\"psychedelic premise [gave] the characters the chance to shine\\". He praised Karen Gillan's difference in performance as the old Amy and her improvement in performance since the previous series. Martin later called it a \\"damn near perfect episode\\", rating it the best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode four out of five stars, praising MacRae's ability to overcome budget issues and deliver \\"quite a powerful and moving drama, with an ending that although inevitable still delivered a well of sadness\\". He thought the older Amy's \\"technical wizardry seemed a tad unlikely\\" (she manages to scrounge up a sonic screwdriver while waiting for the Doctor) but \\"the power of Gillan's performance skated over any minor quibbles\\". In a review for The Independent, Neela Debnath said that \\"critics of the constant tampering with time will not like this episode\\" but \\"it is a cracker in terms of time paradoxes and the hypothetical moral dilemmas caused by said paradoxes\\". She praised the character development of Rory and the dynamic between the trio that had not been seen with previous characters in the show, as well as \\"some great moments of comedy\\". She also called it a \\"sumptuous visual delight\\" in the sets of the garden and the centre. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, praising MacRae for straying away from a complicated time travel narrative and instead give \\"a simple yet refreshingly new examination of Amy Pond\\". He also praised Karen Gillan's climactic performance and director Nick Hurran. However, he criticised the \\"iffy time travel rules\\" and \\"talkiness\\" that ensured a slower pace. SFX magazine reviewer Nick Setchfield awarded \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" five out of five stars, praising Hurran as well as the performance of the three leads. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised MacRae's dialogue because \\"it works so beautifully and is delivered to perfection by Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill\\". He also commented on Gillan's make-up job for the older Amy, which \\"is brilliant in its subtlety\\" but wished her hair could have been \\"chopped or grey\\". Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club was less positive about the episode, grading it as a B-. He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the \\"zingy dialogue\\" but found himself \\"enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really buying into it\\". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin to carry out the whole episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left \\"[didn't] pull it off\\". He thought that the two Amys seen in the mini episodes \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" were more fun to watch and the episode did not reveal anything new about Amy and Rory. However, he praised how the decision the Doctor had to make was portrayed. The episode was nominated for the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), though it lost to Neil Gaiman's episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\".

The first release from Devolution, entitled \\"Cerebrequiem\\", was in the genre of death metal and was released in 1996, featuring session musicians assembled from Mykill's previous band, Astaroth. Singer Larry Sapp (also a member of Brutality) performed vocals, and Tony Laureano (also a member of Malevolent Creation, Dimmu Borgir, and Angelcorpse, and several other death metal bands) recorded the drums for the CD. Another death metal album was written, but technical difficulties and Laureano's touring schedule with Nile prevented this album from being released. The next release was written and recorded in 1999, entitled, Self-Made Monster. This release was in the vein of the industrial metal genre, and was more well-received than the previous release. \\"Death's Shadow\\" was the first single to be promoted, and charted at number 1 on mp3.com for two months for the industrial genre from January 2000 to March 2000, with the second single, \\"Crack Rocks In The Engine Block\\" charting at number 2 in industrial charts, and the third single, \\"Flesh\\", charting in the top 10 in industrial charts on mp3.com, simultaneously. \\"Death's Shadow\\" hit number 1 as well on the CMJ loud music charts in 2000, and on mpulse.com in early 2001 (in their gothic/industrial category), both times with \\"Death's Shadow\\". Mpulse.com did a dual promotion with Hot Topic at that time, and \\"Death's Shadow\\" was also chosen as one of the first tracks to be streaming on Hot Topic radio online. The next release, Grave Matters, in 2001, saw the track \\"Suck It\\" hit number 1 on Mpulse.com in the Gothic/Industrial category as well in March 2001. Mykill joined the band Sister Kill Cycle shortly thereafter, and did not release as Devolution again until 2007 with United Slaves of Amerika, demonstrating Mykill's research into, and growing concern for, the loss of civil liberties in the US following the tragedy of 9/11. The single \\"DCOG (District of Columbia Original Gangsters)\\" from the United Slaves of Amerika release hit number 1 on Myspace.com in the Florida Industrial charts in early 2008. In 2012, Mykill left Sister Kill Cycle, and decided to rename Devolution to United Slaves of Amerika, releasing four new singles since that time. \\"Killing Is Sexy\\" and \\"How To Speak Amerikan\\" were released simultaneously in July 2012, pushing the 'new' musical project into the top slot for the rock category in Tampa on reverbnation.com. After the songs, and daily articles and graphics were posted on the project's Facebook page, and the release of the singles \\"Kill The President\\" and \\"Just Defy,\\" the fast- growing presence on Facebook catapulted United Slaves of Amerika to the number 12 spot on the overall rock charts on reverbnation.com in September 2013.

C. Tway, was a business, agricultural and political icon in the Louisville, Kentucky area. His activities provided a long-lasting footprint in Kentucky as his farm (named Plainview Farms) evolved into a large subdivision and business center located off Hurstbourne Lane, and his former Kentucky Trailer Company continues to manufacture trailers in Jefferson Riverport International.Louisville Courier-Journal, July 3, 2008, Section D, Page 1 He is the namesake of Tway, Kentucky, where he owned a coal mining company for over forty years. Business career Tway was involved in various activities as a businessman, livestock cattle and horse breeder and political leader in Louisville, Kentucky area. His contributions included the ownership of a 975-acre Jersey Cattle dairy and American Saddlebred farm in Jeffersontown, Kentucky. The dairy and horse farm was named Plainview Farms. Other contributions included the ownership and operation of a coal mining company (named R.C. Tway Coal Company) located in Harlan County, Kentucky, a trailer manufacturing company (named Kentucky Trailer or Kentucky Manufacturing Company), and participation in various Kentucky political activities. He was instrumental in formulating the first American Saddlebred Horse Museum to be located in Lexington, Kentucky.Louisville Courier-Journal, May 13, 1964, p. 1 Kentucky Trailer In 1936 Tway purchased Kentucky Wagon Manufacturing Company. With a name change (Kentucky Manufacturing Company under the name of Kentucky Trailers), Tway revolutionized the mode of the transportation industry by building large trailers for the road rather than the more common railway system. The company was located in Louisville, Kentucky near the University of Louisville campus. In 2008, the University of Louisville Foundation agreed to purchase the 33-acre manufacturing tract. Kentucky Trailer relocated to southwestern Jefferson County (Jefferson Riverport International). Kentucky Trailer (known also as Kentucky Manufacturing Company) is currently owned by several fourth generation members of R.C. Tway. Plainview Farms Tway lived or recreationed most of his entire life on a former potato farm, formerly known as the Garr Farm, which located in Jeffersontown, Kentucky. Tway inherited the farm from his mother (Harriet Amelia Garr).Middletown's Days and Deeds, (Founders, Settlers and Family), Page 87 Tway developed the 970-acre farm into a very successful livestock breeding form specializing in American Jersey Dairy cattle and American Saddlebred horses. The dairy farm utilized over 100 head of Jersey Cattle delivering jersey creamline milk and other dairy products in the Louisville area and would serve customers as far away as the University of Kentucky. He raised a national prize-winning American Champion Jersey Cow and owned a winner of the 1939 Grand Champion Kentucky Jersey Cattle Club Trophy -Best Female (Mighty Patsy). In 1941, Kentucky Governor Keen Johnson presented Tway with the Tattersall Trophy having the two best Jersey cattle bred by an exhibitor at the Kentucky State Fair. Plainview Farms was considered the largest dairy in the region. Tway was a very successful breeder and exhibitor of American Saddlebred Horses. On his Plainview Farm, over 50 horses would be annually stalled under his direction. He was most famous for his ownership of Plainview's Julia, the 1959 and 1960 World's Grand Champion Five-gaited American Saddlebred and Plainview's Sophia Van Cleve, the 1960 World's Reserve Champion Three-Year-old Five-gaited American Saddlebred. He was a former director of the National Saddle Horse Breeders Association. The name of the farm is credited to his wife, Mrs. R.C. (Estelle S. Bennett) Tway. When Estelle was asked to name the farm, she noted the farm simply had a plain view, thus \\"Plainview\\" became the name for the former potato farm. R.C. Tway Coal Company Tway was founded in 1912 as Tway operated a coal company from 1914 to 1948 which employed 250 miners and staff in Harlan County, Kentucky. The coal company formed a nearby coal camp named Tway, Kentucky roughly 1 mile south of Harlan. An additional coal camp, also called Tway, was located in Southern Knox County, between Kay-Jay and Anchor. He was also a former owner of the James Coal Company. He served as a member of the Southern Appalachian Coal Operators Association and the Harlan County Coal Operators Association president for sixteen years.Coal Men of America, edited by Arthur M. Hull, Sydney A. Hale, Page 131 Awards Tway was named to the 1964 World's Championship Horse Show Hall of Fame. Personal Tway was raised on his mother's Plainview Farm (formerly Garr farm) home. In 1923, Tway built a Greek Revival home and remained there until his death. He was married to the former Estelle S. Bennett. R.C. Tway, Sr. and Estelle had three children: Robert C. Tway, Jr who inherited the oversight of Kentucky Trailer, William T. Tway (married the daughter of Churchill Downs CEO/Board Chair \\"Willam H. Veeneman\\") who inherited oversight of the Plainview Farms, and Helen Harriet Tway (Robertson). Tway is a 1902 graduate of the Louisville Male High School and attended Kentucky Military Institute for college studies. He was a member and benefactor of Middletown Methodist Church. Tway served on the Kentucky Board of Agriculture and as a University of Kentucky trustee from 1941 to 1949, along with being a former director of the American Jersey Cattle Club. Tway's home, a Greek Revival structure, became a clubhouse to the Plainview subdivision. It is currently owned by the City of Jeffersontown. The \\"Tway House\\" is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He was actively involved in Kentucky and Jefferson County politics, primarily participating in Republican Party activities. Tway was a 1940 alternate delegate and a 1944, 1948, 1952 and 1956 delegate to the Republican National Convention representing Kentucky. He was a member of the Louisville-Jefferson County Republican Party Committee and Vice-Chair of the GOP State Central Committee. Tway is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in eastern Louisville, Kentucky with wife Estelle S (Bennett) Tway, his mother Harriet Amelia (Garr) Tway, and his daughter Helen Harriet (Tway) Robertson.

The great majority of them were included into his 1900s collections: Poems (1887‚Äì1891), Under the Open Skies (1898), Falling Leaves (1901), Flowers of the Field (1901), Poems (1903), Poems (1903‚Äì1906) and Poems of 1907 (1908). Some appeared in short stories' collections (Poems and stories, 1900, Flowers of the Field, 1901, etc.). Volumes 1 and 3 of 1915's The Works by I.A. Bunin were compilations of poems; some were included also into Volume 6. The Adolf Marks' edition represented the whole of Bunin's poetic legacy (as of 1915), starting with the Falling Leaves book's material. Since then Bunin's poems were appearing in his collections of short stories: Chalice of Life (1915), The Gentleman from San Francisco (1916) and Temple of the Sun (1917). Many of his poems (some revised) featured in three books published in emigration: Primal Love (1921), Chalice of Love (1922), Rose of Jerico (1924), Mitya's Love (1925). In 1929 the Selected Poems (1929) came out in Paris.

Popular in the U.K. with much argued regional variations in naming, such as \\"bacon sarnie\\", \\"bacon butty/buttie\\" \\"bacon bap\\", \\"bacon barm\\" or \\"bacon cob\\". Most often served with brown sauce or tomato ketchup. Angels on horseback Angels on horseback Angels on horseback is a hot appetizer made of oysters wrapped with bacon. In the United Kingdom they can also be a savoury, the final course of a traditional British formal meal. They are somewhat similar to Devils on horseback and the Midwestern version of pigs in a blanket, a traditional dish of the American Midwest. Scallops wrapped in bacon appears to be a variation on this dish. Strictly speaking angels on horseback (and the original UK form of pigs in a blanket) are an hors d'≈ìuvre, unlike the US variant of pigs in a blanket, which are canap√©s, since the latter always involve a bread base or wrapping, and angels on horseback are not by necessity served on toast. Bacon sandwich brown bread, butter and a larger-than-typical amount of bacon, assembled to form a bacon sandwich. A bacon sandwich (also known in the UK as a bacon sarnie, bacon butty/buttie, bacon bap, bacon barm, bacon batch or bacon cob and as a bacon sanger or piece 'n bacon in Scotland) is a form of sandwich made from cooked bacon between two slices of bread, usually buttered. Often some form of sauce, such as mayonnaise, tomato ketchup or brown sauce, is included. Cheese & Bacon roll A Cheese and Bacon Roll is a common snack popular in Australia which usually consists of a hamburger bun topped with cheese and bacon. Devils on horseback Bacon wrapped, almond-stuffed dates Devils on horseback are a hot appetizer or savoury. Recipes vary but in general they are a variation on angels on horseback, made by replacing oysters with dried fruit. The majority of recipes contain a pitted prune (though dates are sometimes used) stuffed with mango chutney and wrapped in bacon. This is then baked in the oven and quite often served on toast, with watercress. Other recipes stuff the prune with cheese, almonds, smoked oysters or other things in place of the mango chutney. Other versions again use liver pieces in place of the prunes. Devils on horseback are commonly served as part of a Christmas feast. Double Down KFC \\"Double Down\\" A Double Down is a sandwich offered by Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). The Double Down contains \\"bacon, two different kinds of melted cheese, the Colonel‚Äôs 'secret' sauce... pinched in between two pieces of Original Recipe chicken fillets.\\"Katelin Paiz Breadless sandwiches go to extremes September 17, 2009 Daily Titan (Cal State Fullerton) It is also available with grilled chicken fillets instead of the Original Recipe fried fillets.

Fool's Gold Loaf Fool's Gold Loaf is a sandwich made by the Colorado Mine Company,Often erroneously referred to as the Colorado Gold Mine Company a five-star restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The name of the sandwich is derived from its price of $49.95. In later years, it was priced closer to $100 for the sandwich and a bottle of Dom P√©rignon. Hangtown fry A \\"hangtown burger\\" made using a hangtown fry, a ‚Öì-pound chuck steak, sriracha sauce of roasted red peppers, and baby arugula Hangtown fry is a type of omelette made famous during the California Gold Rush in the 1850s. The most common version includes bacon and oysters combined with eggs, and fried together. The dish was invented in Placerville, California, then known as Hangtown. According to most accounts, the dish was invented when a gold prospector struck it rich, headed to the Cary House Hotel, and demanded the most expensive dish that the kitchen could provide. The most expensive ingredients available were eggs, which were delicate and had to be carefully brought to the mining town; bacon, which was shipped from the East Coast, and oysters, which had to be brought on ice from San Francisco, over 100 miles away. Baconator The Baconator The Baconator sandwich is a hamburger sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Wendy's. It is one of their late-teen‚Äìto‚Äìyoung-adult oriented products. When it was introduced, the hamburger consisted of two 4oz. beef patties, two slices of American cheese, six strips of bacon, mayonnaise, and ketchup on a bun. The sandwich was layered so that there were three strips of bacon on top of each patty. In 2009, Wendy's began offering three different varieties of the Baconator- the Baconator Single (one patty), the Baconator Double (the same as the original), and the Baconator Triple (three patties). At various times Wendy's has offered special limited-time only Baconators such as the Spicy Baconator, which added pepper jack cheese, jalape√±os, and \\"Chipotle Ranch\\" sauce.

Biography Flint was born in London in 1911 and reached the peak of his fame from the 1930s to the 1960s. He was famous for claiming to contact the spirits of dead celebrities, and would often record his sessions. He claimed his familiar, Mickey, was the spirit of a child who had been killed in 1910. Flint claimed to have seen his first spirit at the age of seven when his dead uncle appeared to him in his home.Theresa Cheung. (2006). The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World. Harper Element. pp. 214‚Äì116. He conducted his first s√©ance at the age of 17. In his early life, he worked as a cinema usher and a cemetery gardener. Flint was a conscientious objector in World War II, serving in the Non-Combatant Corps before being seconded to coal-mining. The first public s√©ance performed by Flint was in 1955, just after he formed an association called the Temple of Light. Flint was an avid fan of Rudolph Valentino and acquired the only known copy of footage from The Young Rajah. Flint was wealthy and lived in a mansion house at Westbourne Terrace near London Paddington station. The mansion had been formerly occupied by the actor George Arliss.Anthony Slide. (2002). Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film. The University Press of Kentucky. During pre-production for the 1973 film Don't Look Now, director Nicolas Roeg and actress Julie Christie were invited by Flint to a s√©ance he was holding for some American parapsychologists who were coming to observe him. Roeg and Christie attended and sat in a circle in the pitch dark and joined hands. Flint instructed his guests to \\"uncross\\" their legs, which Roeg subsequently incorporated into the film. Style of mediumship When taking part in s√©ances with Flint, participants would report hearing the voices of the dead surrounding them in the room.Uri Gellar. (13 May 1998). Lend an Ear to the Dead. The Times. Flint would perform bound and gagged in an attempt to prove that he was not throwing his voice. He claimed that he was able to conjure ectoplasm from which he could then reconstruct vocal cords. However, Flint always insisted on performing in the dark, so s√©ance-goers were unable to see him during the performances. He would sometimes even perform in a cupboard.

West examined the cabinet before the s√©ance and personally attached a tape to Flint's mouth. After the s√©ance he examined the tape covering Flint's mouth and it was no longer in line with the indelible marking that he had made. West asked Flint for further testing but Flint refused.Peter H. Aykroyd, Angela Narth and Dan Aykroyd. (2009). A History of Ghosts: The True Story of S√©ances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters. Rodale Books. pp. 80‚Äì81. Gladys Lorrimore who attended a s√©ance denied that the supposed \\"spirit voice\\" from Flint's direct-voice mediumship was her husband as the voice did not sound anything like her husband. Another of Flint's spirit voices was supposed to be from Helena Blavatsky, however the voice had no Russian accent. Flint accused of using prerecorded tapes to produce voices, as well as live accomplices providing a two-way voice channels. Parapsychologists from the Society for Psychical Research who attended s√©ances with Flint also claimed he was using ventriloquism to produce the voices that they had heard. Researcher Melvin Harris examined the tapes of Flint's direct-voice mediumship and wrote \\"I have to conclude that his spirits are awfully mixed up. His Valentino speaks with a stage French accent ‚Äì shades of Charles Boyer ‚Äì while his George Bernard Shaw sounds like an irascible English colonel, with no trace of his precise and memorable soft Irish brogue.\\" Harris believed Flint to be a fraud and compared his mediumship to the fraudulent medium William Roy. In 1970 William Rauscher and Allen Spraggett attended a sitting with Flint in New York and said that Flint's mediumship was a disaster as the spirit voices sounded exactly like Flint.M. Lamar Keene. (1997). The Psychic Mafia. Prometheus Books. p 122. \\"A medium still riding high in England is Leslie Flint, famed as an exponent of direct voice. William Rauscher and Allen Spraggett, who attended a sitting Flint held in 1970 in New York, said that it was the most abysmal flop of any seance they had endured. All the spirit voices sounded exactly like the medium and displayed an incredible ignorance of nearly everything pertaining to the sitters. The \\"mediumship \\" was second-rate ventriloquism.\\" Flint once gave an interview live for the BBC radio.

The vision of the charity is ‚Äòa world where lives are no longer limited by primary bone cancer‚Äô and regularly uses the slogan ‚Äòuntil there's a cure.‚Äô The charity is the global authoritative voice on primary bone cancer. Fundraising events for the charity are accompanied by the hashtag ‚Äò#TeamBones.‚Äô The charity‚Äôs aim is to improve outcomes for people with primary bone cancer through research, awareness, information and support. History The Bone Cancer Research Trust was initially a parents‚Äô group started in September 2004. Five families who had lost children to osteosarcoma and who all wanted to see more research carried out into this rare cancer to hopefully improve the outcome for future sufferers were brought together. The parents' group increased with the addition of families, including one from Ireland, whose children had battled against another primary bone cancer, Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma. Expanding the group helped to unite skills and enthusiasm as well as funds already raised. The families pooled money totalling ¬£176,000, to start the charity and fund the first pieces of research. The Bone Cancer Research Trust became a registered charity in March 2006 and by September 2006, the first two successful applications for research grants had been accepted. Growth In just two years, the meeting of a small group of bereaved parents grew into a significant and credible international charity with a turnover of around ¬£1,000,000 per annum, which is driving research into the causes and treatment of primary bone cancer and in particular of osteosarcoma, Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Website The Bone Cancer Research Trust's website, provides information about the charity‚Äôs activities, including details of past and present research being funded by the charity; primary bone cancer information, information for Health Care Professionals, a patient‚Äôs forum, stories of people‚Äôs bone cancer journeys, links to BCRT's Twitter and Facebook pages, and YouTube Channel. Research funding The charity normally puts out two research calls per year. To date the charity has funded 83 projects totalling ¬£3.9 million resulting in numerous peer reviewed publications. Research proposals are peer reviewed and externally assessed by the Independent Scientific Advisory Panel. The current panel chair is Professor Pamela Kearns, a research active clinical paediatric oncologist. Present day activities and future direction The families who formed the charity had major concerns regarding the lack of reliable information available. Little detailed information resources were available in the UK or the internet as a whole. Alongside research funding, information provision is now one of the charities activities. The Bone Cancer Research Trust provides information (online and printed) on primary bone cancers for patients, their families, the general public, media and Health Care Professionals. Currently there is detailed information on osteosarcoma, Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma and chondrosarcoma and a glossary/ medical dictionary. BCRT produce information specifically aimed at children, teenagers and adults. In addition, information on other primary bone cancers such as chordoma, spindle cell sarcomas, angiosarcoma and a list of open and recruiting clinical trials are available. The charity also provides support for patients and their families and friends, and in the longer term, specialist counselling services may be made available for them. Raising awareness The Bone Cancer Research Trust has an annual \\"Awareness Week\\" during which the charity concentrates on gaining as much local and national media coverage as possible in order to inform and educate people about primary bone cancer symptoms.Be aware of the symptoms of bone cancer: http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/8441824.Be_aware_of_the_symptoms_of_bone_cancer/BCRT Awareness Week: http://www.bonecancerresearch.org.uk/aw_awareness_week_2010.php Cancer victim's family praises charity website: http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest- news/cancer_victim_s_family_praises_charity_website_1_3012852Son's life saved thanks to parents persistence: http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Son- s-life-saved-thanks-parents-persistence/article-2764839-detail/article.html The Bone Cancer Research Trust website information about symptoms of bone cancers is more complete than all other sources of information. This is important for medical practitioners when they are diagnosing as well as for young people and their parents when they need to be aware that some symptoms really do need to be checked by a doctor. During Awareness Week various activities are carried out by the charity‚Äôs supporters, with the main campaign being \\"Bake a Cake for Bone Cancer\\". Another highlight is the annual Patients‚Äô and Supporters‚Äô Conference, which brings together patients and parents with the many different professionals whose work affects the lives of those who find themselves with a diagnosis of bone cancer.Callum bakes for bone cancer fund: http://www.leighjournal.co.uk/news/8469631.Callum_bakes_for_bone_cancer_fund/Bake a Cake: http://www.bonecancerresearch.org.uk/f_bake_a_cake_2010.php Fundraising The work of the Bone Cancer Research Trust is almost entirely funded by the public. The charity raises money through donations, community fundraising events, retail and legacies. Fundraising events are commonly tagged on social media using ‚Äò#TeamBones.‚Äô Publications The Bone Cancer Research Trust produces a twice yearly newsletter entitled \\"United\\". Partnerships The Bone Cancer Research Trust has National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Partner status. The charity also works closely with Sarcoma UK, The Teenage Cancer Trust and the Information Standard. Board of Trustees BCRT governance is provided by a Board of Trustees. The current chairman is Andrew Lewis (patient parent). The deputy chairman is Roger Paul (patient parent). The remaining Board consists of Gill Johnstone (founder and patient parent), Sarah Dawson (patient parent), Mr Jonathan Stevenson (consultant orthopaedic surgeon), Malcolm Matthews (patient parent), Professor Bernadette Brennan (consultant paediatric oncologist), Hannah Millington (former patient), Arlene Eves (former patient), Dr Darrell Green (research active molecular biologist and geneticist), Professor Alison Gartland (research active molecular and cell biologist) and Damian Harper (former patient).

It was named after Isaac Puente and was n¬∫ 3 of the Milicias Antifascistas de la CNT and n¬∫ 11 of the Euzko Gudarostea. The battalion participated in the Villarreal Offensive, the Vizcaya Campaign, the Battle of Santander, the Asturias Campaign and the Battle of El Mazuco. Origins The battalion was named in memory of Isaac Puente, an anarchist theorist who had been shot by the nationalists on September 1, 1936. The Isaac Puente Battalion was formed in September 1936, in the barracks of the Casilla de Bilbao. On September 25, in this same barracks, the battalion withstood their first aerial bombardment by nationalist forces.  History   Villarreal offense  The battalion first saw combat during the Villarreal Offensive in the Chavalopea del Monte pine forest, in the first days of November 1936. Although it defended its position and its commander was congratulated by the General Staff, the subsequent defeat was terrible and the battalion suffered more than 200 casualties, including about 100 dead.  In the siege of Oviedo  On February 13 the battalion left Basauri to fight in Asturias, within the 1st Basque Expeditionary Brigade. Between February and March, it participated in the Siege of Oviedo, in the San Claudio sector. The battalion achieved its objective but had to fall back before the failure of other republican units. The battalion then returned from Asturias to stop the enemy offensive, acting from the top of Barazar.  Vizcaya Campaign  In March 1937 there were various disagreements between the Basque Government and the CNT, and the Isaac Puente Battalion had a strong confrontation with two PNV battalions that came out in Galdakao, but finally everything was solved without armed confrontation. The Biscay Campaign began at the end of March, the battalion fought in the Barazar port area. At the end of April it helped in the definitive withdrawal from the Gipuzkoan fronts, and at the beginning of May the battalion returned to the area of mount Sollube, on the coast of Vizcaya. In May 1937, the battalion fought in the Bizkargi mountains alongside Asturian troops.  The withdrawal to Cantabria and Asturias  After the fall of Bizkaia into Francoist hands, the \\"Isaac Puente\\" battalion marched towards Cantabria. After the Pact of Santo√±a and the surrender of the PNV, the \\"Isaac Puente\\" battalion continued fighting, becoming the 1st Battalion of the 156th Mixed Brigade (former 3rd Basque Brigade) within the 1st Basque Division. After visiting Solares and Torrelavega, the battalion withdrew to Asturias, where it fought in September and October, standing out in the Battle of El Mazuco. In this battle, the battalion was decorated with the Medal of Freedom (highest distinction of the Second Spanish Republic) awarded by Belarmino Tom√°s, president of the Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le√≥n, to the commander of the battalion, Antonio Teresa de Miguel. After fighting until the end in Asturias and before the imminent final collapse of the Northern Front, part of its men evacuated by sea, managing to escape the siege and reach the coast of France to fight again in Catalunya in different units.  Tributes  In July 2006 several members of the battalion participated in a tribute to the Euzko Gudarostea, including F√©lix Pad√≠n Gallo, Marcelino Bilbao and Francisco Alonso Uriarte.

It employs the fanned-fret system started by Novax Guitars for manufacturing basses, increasing the scale length of the strings on the bass side of the guitar compared to the treble side. This design is more akin to a piano or harp, giving the bass strings length that increases the sustain. Dingwall produces 9 different models of bass guitars: 7 of them are produced out of their main shop in Saskatoon, while the remaining 2 models are manufactured in China using North American sourced materials and set-up again in Canada. The model names of the Dingwall bass guitar line-up are the Prima Artist, Z, Lee Sklar Signature, Super J, Super P, Afterburner I, Afterburner II, D-Bird series, Combustion, and NG. The company was founded in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, by Sheldon Dingwall in 1987, and its headquarters are still located there. Dingwall is a privately held corporation, with Sheldon Dingwall serving as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Origins Sheldon Dingwall played music from a young age, starting with piano at the age of 5, drums at the age of 10, and guitar at the age of 12. He built his first guitar in his uncle's workshop, when he couldn't find the Floyd Rose guitar he wanted to buy, and decided to built it himself instead. His uncle mentored Sheldon with notions of woodworking, metalworking and finishing, after which he built 3 guitars, which he toured with for 3 years. He modified those guitars during his tours, in his hotel rooms, after which Sheldon decided to go back to Saskatoon to start a guitar neck manufacturing business.. He got a job at a local music store, doing guitar repairs. After some time the store offered Sheldon to set up a shop in their store, first making necks, later making also bodies, and later on to entire instrument builds. Some time later he started making bass guitars, which eventually led to using fanned-frets, which have since become Dingwall Guitar's most distinguishing feature. Instruments Basses All Dingwall bass guitars are constructed using fanned frets. This extends the scale length of the 5th string on most of their models to 37\\", rather than the more common 34\\" achieved using traditional parallel fret bass designs. Reviews for Dingwall basses have mostly been positive. In a review for the Afterburner series of basses, Bass Player Magazine concluded that the Afterburner was \\"an exceptional bass. The extra scale length clearly improves low-note focus and pitch definition, and Dingwall's uncompromising workmanship is world class\\". Another review for Vintage Guitar Magazine also complimented Dingwall's tone and craftsmanship in a review of the Super J bass: \\"Every component, from the pickups and electronics to the selection of tone woods, and the hardware, are all well-conceived and executed, and the craftsmanship is superb.\\"Feser, Phil, \\"Dingwall Super J\\": Jammin J-Style\\". Vintage Guitar Magazine, January 26, 2010 Other reviews have noted, though, that the fanned-fret design can make Dingwall basses more challenging to play. In an early review, Bass Player Magazine concluded that the fanned-fret design \\"isn't as difficult to play as you might think...but you will have to spend some time adapting your technique to get the most out of this innovative design\\". The review also noted the need for special strings to optimize the tone achieved from the basses, as the strings are longer than standard guitar strings.Malandrone, Scott, Bass Player Magazine, January 1996 Guitars In 2010, Dingwall reintroduced electric guitars to the instrument lineup. While only a few have been produced so far, early models have been well received. The music community Harmony Central reviewed a Dingwall Custom I, stating \\"the look of the Dingwall Custom I is pure Rock‚Äôn Roll...the bridge pickup nails the crunchy yet warm classic rock tone with a distinct almost cello-like character. Models Basses *Prima Artist: The Prima Artist is Dingwall's most premium model. The body is built out of walnut on the bass side and soft figured maple on the treble side, and features a neck laminated from 5 to 7 pieces of exotic wood and dual carbon-fiber truss rods. The custom pickups have matching wood covers and a Glockenklang pre-amp. *Z: The Z model has the same body and headstock shape to the Prima Artist's, but it's made of high density swamp ash on both bass and treble side of the body and features a 5-piece laminated maple neck. It has 2 or 3 Super-Fatty Dingwall pickups, and an optional Darkglass Tone Capsule pre- amp. *Lee Sklar II Signature: The prominent American bassist Leland Sklar has been a Dingwall endorsing artist for over 10 yearshttps://www.dingwallguitars.com/lee-sklar-signature and they are his main touring basses and one of his most used recording basses. This bass model's body is build out of Northern ash on the bass side and alder on the treble side, and features a 5-piece laminated maple neck. The electronics include 2 Super-Fatty II pickups, and a modified Glockenklang 3-band pre-amp. The finish is shiny polyester. *Super J: The Super J is Dingwall's re-design of the classic jazz-style bass in a scale 2‚Äù shorter than the Dingwall standard scale range. The Super J model body is a 2 or 3 piece alder and the neck is a 5-piece laminated maple. It has, like the Super P model, a distinctive special headstock design. This model is passive, and has 2 or 3 passive FDV pickups. *Super P: The Super P model, like the Super J, is Dingwall's reinterpretation of the classic Precision Bass. It has a 2 or 3 piece alder body and the neck is a 5-piece laminated maple. Like the Super J model, the body is slightly thinner than the regular Dingwall bodies to reduce weight, and also features the same Super J distinctive headstock design. The electronics are an FD3 pickup in the neck position, and an FDV (and optional Super-Fatty II) in the bridge position. *Afterburner: the Afterburner series consists of 3 models, the Afterburner I (a lightweight, passive bass with alder body and maple neck and passive FDV pickups), the Afterburner II (a semi-hollow walnut body with an exhibition grade walnut top, maple neck and passive FDV pickups), and the ABZ (the lightest bass among all Dingwall models, with a satin finished swamp ash body, maple neck and wenge fretboard, featuring also passive FDV pickups). *D-Bird: Dingwall's reinterpretation of the classic Gibson Thunderbird body shape is made of Fijian Mahogany with a wenge neck and fingerboard. The electronics feature 3 passive FD3n pickups. The D-Bird sports its own unique headstock design. *Combustion: Dingwall ships North American parts to be further processed and assembled in China, making the Combustion and the NG models the lowest priced models in the company's portfolio. Final setup and inspection is done in the Dingwall facilities in Canada, and feature a swamp ash body, 5-piece maple necks and fingerboard, FD-3N pickups and an EMG 3-band pre-amp. *NG: Adam \\"Nolly\\" Getgood Signature range, also assembled in China. It is based on the Combustion design, but it has an alder body, maple neck and fretboard and a custom Darkglass Tone Capsule pre-amp. It also features a carbon fiber print pickguard and racing/tuner inspired finishes.

After heavy combats the Nationalist forces with a crushing material superiority managed to occupy the city of Bilbao and the Biscay province. Background By late October 1936, all Gipuzkoa was occupied by the rightist rebel forces. The western front settled at the foot of Intxorta (Elgeta). However, Mola did not hide his plans to use air force against Basque territory loyal to the Republic. Despite Basque nationalist attempts at guaranteeing no shelling on civilians, Spanish Nationalist aircraft raided Bilbao on September 25 and 26, an indiscriminate attack on its starving population that spread a blaze of outrage across the city. Oblivious to foreseeable consequences, the Nationalists resumed ferocious air strikes against the city on 4 January 1937, prompting yet another outcry of indignation and an assault on the prison-ships where right-wingers were being held. It resulted in a death toll of 224. On 22 March 1937, Franco decided to halt his offensive against Madrid and start an offensive against the northern Republican held zone. The northern zone was politically divided and isolated from the central Republican zone. Furthermore, there was most of Spanish iron and coal and the chemical plants of Biscay. The Nationalists decided to start the occupation of the northern Republican zone with the conquest of the Biscay province. Opposing forces The Nationalists had the Emilio Mola's Army of the North (55,000 men). The Nationalist attack started with the Navarrese Division, led by the General Jos√© Solchaga. This division had four brigades led by the Colonels Garcia Vali√±o, Alonso Vega, Cayuela and Latorre (18,000 men) and the Black Arrow division (8,000 men with Italian officers). This force was established between Vergara and Villareal, on the border of the Biscay province. The Nationalist had also 200 guns, 120 aircraft, the battleship Espa√±a, the cruisers Canarias and Almirante Cervera and the destroyer Velasco. Opposing them, the Republicans had General Francisco Llano de la Encomienda's Army of the North, theoretically numbered 150,000, but there were no unity between the Basque Nationalists, the Asturians and the Santaderinos. The Basque Army in Biscay had 30,000 men (most of them Basque Nationalists and also Asturians). The Republicans also had 140 guns, 25-30 aircraft, two destroyers and three submarines. The offensive The Nationalist offensive started on 31 March and Mola threatened to bomb the Basque cities and industries:\\"I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war.\\". The same day the Aviazione Legionaria bombed the town of Durango, resulting in 250 civilian deaths. On 1 April the Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega captured the mountains of Maroto, Albertia and Jarindo, and the Navarrase troops attacked the town of Ochandiano and encircled the Basque troops in it. The Navarrese occupied the town on 4 April, after heavy combats and aerial bombardment. The Basque troops left 400 deaths and 600 prisoners. Then Mola, decided to stop the advance due bad weather. On 6 April the Nationalist government in Burgos announced the blockade of the Basque ports. The British government said that the blockade was effective and warned British ships not to go to Bilbao. Nevertheless, British merchants broke the blockade and entered in Basque ports. On 20 April the Nationalists continued their offensive after a heavy artillery bombardment. The Basque troops led by Major Pablo Belderra√≠n tried to resist but the 1st Navarrese Brigade led by Colonel Garcia Vali√±o broke the front and occupied Elgeta. The same day the Legion Condor bombed Guernica. The Basques retreated to the Iron Belt line and the Legion Condor bombed the roads and woods with incendiary bombs. Then, the Lendakari, J√≥s√© Antonio Aguirre, decided to assume the command of the Basque troops, due to the incompetence of Llano de la Encomienda. On 30 April the Italians occupied Bermeo, but the Republican battleship Jaime I, was damaged by a mine. As the Nationalist troops approached Bilbao, the autonomous Basque government made an international plea to save the children of war flocking to the city. More than 20,000 were evacuated to 'temporary' safety on chartered boats, most of them to permanent exile. The fall of Bilbao The Republican government tried to send fighters to the Basque country across France, but the French government returned the aircraft after confiscating its machine guns. The commander of the Spanish Republican Air Force, Hidalgo de Cisneros, decided to send 50 fighters and bombers to the Basque Country, across the Nationalist held territory, 45 reached Bilbao. Meantime, the bad weather stopped again the Nationalist offensive, a new shipment of weapons (55 antiaircraft guns, 30 cannons and two squadrons of Chatos), reached Bilbao, and the General G√°mir was sent to Biscay in order to organize the defense of Bilbao and to replace Llano de la Encomienda. The Republican government launched two offensives in Segovia and Huesca to halt the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao but both failed. Mola died on 3 June and was replaced by General Davila. On 11 June the Nationalist troops reached the Iron Belt and on 12 June after a heavy aerial and artillery bombing (150 guns and 70 bombers) the Nationalist troops assaulted it. A Basque deserter, Major Goicoechea, gave the plans of the Iron Belt to the Nationalists. The Nationalists attacked Mount Urcullu and broke the Basque lines. On 14 June the Basque government left Bilbao, on 18 June the Basque troops was ordered to leave the city and by 19 June the Nationalists conquered the city. 200 thousand people were evacuated westwards to Santander, on trawlers first and cars, horse carts, lorries and on foot later. They were bombed over by Condor Legion aircraft along the way. Aftermath The Basque army temporarily stabilized the front on a line that runs south from the village of Ont√≥n on the coast. Biscay had the only factory in Spain capable of the manufacture of artillery shells and half of the Spanish production of explosives. Virtually all manufacturing and shipbuilding industry remained untarnished, since the Basque nationalist authorities' opposed its destruction. The arrival of the rebels to the city was followed by ransacking, murder, and pseudo-trials. 8,000 thousand were imprisoned for their Basque nationalist leanings, and many of them sent to forced 'work battalions'. In December, executions by fire- squad and garrote vil started to be conducted. The number of executions during and after the fall of Biscay is estimated at 916. The Basque autonomy was abolished and the Basque tongue forbidden.

Background After the failed Republican offensive against Zaragoza, the Nationalists decided to redeploy their forces and continued their offensive against the last piece of Republican-held territory in the North, Asturias. On 29 August, the Sovereign Council of Asturias, led by Belarmino Tomas, assumed all military and civil powers and appointed Colonel Prada as commander of the Republican Army of the North.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. p. 301 Opposing forces The Nationalist offensive was launched by General D√°vila's Army of the North, with 80,000 men. This force included Jos√© Solchaga's four Navarrese brigades, Aranda's three divisions and the Italian CTV. The Nationalists also had 250 cannons and 250 aircraft.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. p. 301. Opposing them, the Republicans had the Army of the North, led by Colonel Prada, with the XIV Army Corps led by Francisco Gal√°n (8,000‚Äì10,000 men) and Colonel Linares's XVII Army corps (35,000). Prada's chief of staff was Francisco Ciutat. The Republicans had 180 cannons,Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p. 707 one squadron of Chatos and two flights of Moscas, around 35 aircraft.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. p. 301. The Nationalist Offensive The destroyer C√≠scar, sank at Gij√≥n's harbour on 20 October. The Nationalist offensive started on 1 September, with Solchaga advancing from the East and Aranda from the southwest, but despite their crushing numerical and air superiority their advance was painfully slow (less than a kilometre a day). The Republicans fought fiercely, and the difficult terrain of the Cordillera Cantabrica provided excellent defensive positions. Solchaga's troops (33,000 men) occupied Llanes on September 5 and in the Battle of El Mazuco attacked the heights, held by the CNT workers from La Felguera (5,000 men).http://www.speleogroup.org/files/ElMazuco-impossible-defence.html The Navarrese eventually took the valley and surrounding mountains, but only after 33 days of bloody combat. On September 18, the Nationalists occupied Ribadesella, and on 1 October Covadonga, but by 14 October the Republicans still held several high passes of the Leonese Mountains.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. p. 302 The main goal of the Republicans was to delay the Nationalist advance until winter came. Nevertheless, the Legion Condor returned from the Aragon front and started to bomb the Republican positions. The German squadrons used cans of petrol attached to incendiary bombs and tested the idea of carpet bombing. On 14 October Arriondas fell, and Colonel Mu√±oz Grandes managed to break the Republican front, entering Tama and advancing to Campo de Caso.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. London. p. 302 The Republican troops retreated to Gij√≥n, and on 15 October Solchaga's troops joined up with Aranda's troops.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.708 The Republican government then ordered a general evacuation.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. London. p. 302 On 17 October the Sovereign Council of Asturias decided to start the evacuation, but the Legion Condor sank the Republican destroyer Ciscar, and the Nationalist fleet blocked the Asturian harbours. Only the senior officers managed to escape on gunboats and fishing vessels (Prada, Gal√°n, Segundo Blanco, Belarmino Tomas). On 20 October, twenty-two Republican battalions surrendered, and Colonel Jos√© Franco handed over the town of Trubia to the Nationalists. On October 21, the Nationalists entered Gij√≥n, ending the occupation of Asturias. Nevertheless, thousands of Republican soldiers fled to the nearby mountains and started a guerrilla campaign against the Nationalist troops.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.708‚Äì710 Aftermath The Nationalist reprisals were harsh. In Oviedo alone, 1,000 republican prisoners were shot.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p. 710 The Republican prisoners were sent to labour battalions or were forced to join the Nationalist army (around 100,000).Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. London. pp. 302-303. Furthermore, with the conquest of the North, the Nationalists now controlled 36 per cent of Spanish industrial production, 60 per cent of the coal, and all of the steel-production.Thomas, Hugh.

The silhouette of the mountain range takes the shape of a reclining woman with when seen from certain angles, hence its name which means \\"dead woman\\" in the Spanish language. The highest point is La Pinareja (2197 m). Aerial view of La Mujer Muerta  Legends  There are many legends that try to explain the name, La Mujer Muerta, with the mountains La Pinareja, Pe√±a el Oso, and Pico de Pasap√°n that form, when viewed from the city, the body of a woman that is dead or sleeping. One story is that the woman's husband went off to war and failed to keep his promise that he would return and marry her. She died of a broken heart and that is her body in the mountain.

He was the son of Hofmarschall Nathanael Truhn and the grandfather of Selma Erdmann-Jesnitzer, born Bethge-Truhn, father of Clara and Anna Marie Elizabeth Truhn. He was a very special person and a talented composer of numerous songs, several stage works, and also a key organizer in the field of men's choirs. Life Friedrich as a boy attracted by his singing abilities, so just as soon he was developing himself as a flute player, and shortly thereafter as a violinist, he was sent to the orchestra of his native town, although his parents did not admitted that he had chosen the music as a career. Only in 1831 they allowed him to go to Berlin as a student of theorist Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn, of Carl Friedrich Zelter and Bernhard Klein. He briefly studied orchestration with Mendelssohn to be properly trained as musician. He worked at the city theater in Gdansk as conductor and music teacher in the years 1835-37 and back in Berlin, he became one of the chief contributors to Schumann's paper, the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, Hamburger Correspondenten and the feature pages of the Neue Berliner Musikzeitung. In 1840 Friedrich lived in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia, and there held great performances of his own and others musicians' compositions. In 1843 he accompanied the pianist Theodor D√∂hler on an art trip to Sweden, where he acted as composer and conductor. In 1848 he returned to his birthplace, founded a choral society and organized many public performances. There he worked until 1852 as a music teacher and conductor. In the meantime he again worked as a freelancer in Berlin, founded the Berliner Liedertafel, a choral society on the conceptual model of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In 1854 he traveled with Mr. von B√ºlow, and then he settled in Riga, where he worked as vocal and music theory teacher until 1858. After that he settled permanently in Berlin. His printed compositions, summoning up to well over 100 opus, were almost consistently received in critical acclaim, but in no way they became universally popular pieces. They were played, sung and then set aside. Truhn was welcome in all social circles, both as a guest and also as a music teacher. His death put an end not only to his life, but also to the viability of his compositions as the newspapers of the time published obituaries often appreciative of his person and talent as a classical composer.

The two buildings comprise nearly 1.2 million square feet of leasable space, about 40 percent of the office space leasing market in Rockland County, with approximately 1,800 people employed by tenants ranging from smaller startups to large offices of well-known corporations such as Blue Hill Data Services, Verizon, Orange & Rockland Utilities, Active International, Fujitsu and Hunter Douglas.  History  Originally planned as the first two buildings of a four building complex at the northwest end of Lake Tappan, Blue Hill Plaza was designed by notable modernist architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Completed in 1972, it was one of the last projects built by Uris Buildings Corporation of New York City. Blue Hill Plaza was acquired in 1996 by Glorious Sun Robert Martin LLC, partnership of Westchester County-based Robert Martin Company and Hong Kong- and Manhattan- based real estate company, Glorious Sun. It is leased and managed by CBRE Blue Hill Plaza Contact- Blue Hill Plaza  Features  Blue Hill Plaza's main lobbies and concourse feature full-height mahogany wall panels, satin aluminum reveals, acoustical tile ceilings with architectural energy-efficient pendant lighting, zolatone-finished columns, and a touch screen directory. The concourse also features regular art exhibits displaying works from local and national artists. Building amenities include a health club, childcare center, atrium caf√©, approximately 3,000 parking spaces, hair salon, postal services, banking and 24/7 building access with on-site security.  Location  Blue Hill Plaza is located in Pearl River, NY, Rockland County, approximately 20 miles north of the George Washington Bridge to Manhattan. It is directly across from the Hilton Pearl River and the Blue Hill Golf Course, off Veterans Memorial Drive between the Tappan Zee and George Washington bridges, with nearby access to I-80, I-87, I-95, I-287, and the Garden State and Palisades parkways. It borders Bergen County, NJ, a NYC suburb and home to numerous corporate headquarters.  Sustainability  In 2008, Blue Hill Plaza received the Rockland Recycles Award, and the Rockland County Distinguished Service Award for its recycling strategies that reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, while also reducing costs. The recycling program has 100 percent tenant participation, and has reduced solid waste disposed by the complex by 40 percent since inception, with an estimated accumulated savings of $250,000. Blue Hill Plaza has diverted over 9,300 tons of cardboard, over 2,100 tons of mixed papers, and over 40 tons of bottles, cans and plastics.  Telecom and Power  Blue Hill Plaza features redundant fiber optic. There is fiber available from two central offices, entering two separate telephone equipment rooms within the site. There are two (2) 69,000-volt underground feeders from a substation located in Montvale, NJ to an Orange & Rockland substation, dedicated solely to Blue Hill Plaza, located on-site in the parking lot. The two transmission lines from Montvale are encased separately in concrete. From Blue Hill Plaza's on-site substation, which is maintained by Orange & Rockland, there are two (2) 13,200-volt underground feeders that power the substations within the building. In both cases one feeder can carry the building load. (This does not include the data center power) There are two (2) 20 MW (Megawatt) transformers.

The d'Estaing family was one of the most notable noble families of the Rouergue and Auvergne regions of France. They originated from Estaing, in the modern Aveyron department where their ch√¢telain has been traced to the start of the 11th century.First mentioned in 1028. The house of d'Estaing became extinct in France with the death of Admiral Charles Henri d'Estaing (in 1794), who had no son as heir. The genealogy of the d'Estaing family has not documented any connection to the family of Giscard d'Estaing, which permitted in 1922 to take the name.  History  In 1214, at the Battle of Bouvines, D√©odat, known as Tristan, was said to have saved the life of King Philippe Auguste and given him his horse. In recognition, the king gave D√©odat the right to adopt the arms of France, keeping the golden chef that covered his former arms.Merveilles des ch√¢teaux d'Auvergne et du Limousin (R√©alit√©s Hachette, 1971, p.23) Recent historians have not been able to confirm the veracity of this legend. The family produced prelates, officers, Knights of Malta and numerous notable figures. It received the Honneurs de la Cour (a prestigious honour granted only to the families of ancient nobility and allowing them to approach the King and the Queen) in 1750.  Principal figures * Guillaume I d‚ÄôEstaing was a companion of Richard the Lionheart during the Third Crusade. * Tristan Dieudonn√© d‚ÄôEstaing saved the life of King Philippe Auguste at Bouvines in 1214. In recognition of this event, he received the right to place three fleurs de lys on his shield. This fact is today contested. * Guillaume d'Estaing, lord of Estaing, married in 1319 Ermengarde de Peyre, lady of Valentines, daughter of Astorg IX of Peyre and de Maguerire of Murat, lady of Cheylade who gave him eight children, including : ** Raymond d'Estaing married in 1350 Baranne de Castelnau; ** Flore d'Estaing, married Aymeric d'Aurillac, lord of Conros; ** Cardinal Pierre d‚ÄôEstaing made part of the Pontifical Court at Avignon. He was pontifical legate for Gregory XI to the pontifical states in Italy; ** Richarde d'Estaing, married in 1345 G√©raud de Murat, lord of Lugarde, Allagnat and S√©gur; ** Marguerite d'Estaing, married Pierre IV, lord of Brezons * Dieudonn√© d'Estaing, nephew of the cardinal, dean of Laon then bishop of Tricastin (1388‚Äì1411) * Guillaume d'Estaing distinguished himself in the fight against infidels (?). * Jean d'Estaing ( -1495), chamarier of Lyon from 1480 to 1494, was named in 1484 governor of the county of Rodez and Montagnes de Rouergue. * Fran√ßois d'Estaing, rector of Comtat Venaissin, from 1505 to 1509, bishop of Rodez from 1504 to 1529, built the bell tower at the Rodez Cathedral. * Antoine d'Estaing (1455 - ‚Ä†28 February 1523), member of the grand council of Louis XII (1495), bishop of Angoul√™me (1506‚Äì1523), dean of the chapter of Lyon (1514). * L'Abb√© Charles d'Estaing (ca1595-1661), lord of Cheylade and Marchastel, Knight of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. Violent, debauched and greedy, he tried to reestablish taxes that fallen out of use for more than a century, provoking a revolt. Tried in his absence and sentenced to death by the Court of Grands Jours d'Auvergne, his property was confiscated and his title removed. His sentence was commuted to service in a regiment serving in Germany, where he distinguished himself by his courage and died rehabilitated in 1661, without having married. In his will, he mentioned a daughter, Marguerite, as his natural child (illegitimate). He was regarded by the Giscard d'Estaing family as the first of the d'Estaing family of Puy-de-D√¥me; they took their name from him. * Admiral d'Estaing (Ravel 1729 - Paris 1794), son of Charles-Fran√ßois and Marie-Henrielle de Colbert, played a significant part in the naval wars of the 18th century and in the American Revolutionary War. He was named an admiral in 1792 by the Legislative Assembly, but was guillotined in 1794 during the French Revolution. Having lost his only son, he legitimised his half-sister Lucie-Madeleine and, on 25 February 1768, made her heir to his property, in particular the Ch√¢teau de Ravel. Known under the title Comte d'Estaing, he commanded the National Guard of Versailles during the October March in 1789.  The last d'Estaings  At the end of the 18th century, all the branches of the d'Estaing family were descended from a single couple: Jean d'Estaing (¬∞/1540-1621), lord of Val, married in 1580 Gilberte de la Rochefoucauld (1560‚Äì1623), lady Ravel, they had four sons : * 1¬∞ Fran√ßois II d'Estaing, founded the comtes de Ravel branch for three generations to : ** Fran√ßois IV d'Estaing (Ravel 1693 - Paris 1729), count of Estaing, who died without heir and was succeeded by Admiral d'Estaing below ; * 2¬∞ P√®re Louis d'Estaing, grand aum√¥nier de France; * 3¬∞ Jacques d'Estaing (+1657), lord of Terrisse, married Catherine du Bourg, lady of Saillant, fromm whom were descended after four generations : ** Admiral d'Estaing and his half-sister ** Lucie Madeleine d'Estaing (Paris 1743 - Clermont-Ferrand 1826), viscounts of Ravel in Auvergne, illegitimate half-sister of the admiral, mistress of Louis XV; married, she had numerous descendants, including two daughters by Louis XV. * 4¬∞ L'Abb√© Charles d'Estaing (ca1595-1661), lord of Cheylade, Knight of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He died in 1661 with a debauched reputation, having made two wills in which he recognised a natural daughter but no son. However, the Giscard d'Estaing genealogy attributes their paternity to Joachim d'Estaing, lord of R√©quistat. No birth record or other document exists for Charles' daughter.Christian du Passage, Histoire et g√©n√©alogie, 160-266, October 2001  Other Destaing or d'Estaing families   Destaing of Cantal  Notable legal family, established in the Carlad√®s, with noble connections from the start of the 16th century, ending with : * Zacharie Destaing (Aurillac 1764 - Paris 1802), general, son of Pierre Destaing and Marie-Gabrielle Delzons, seventh generation descendant of : ** Jehan Destaing, lord of Labouygues, royal notary in Marcol√®s, in the Cantal d√©partement, and Souveraine de Chivialle. It could be a small branch of the d'Estaing family.  Destaing of R√©quistat  Following a request, the Giscard family was authorised in 1922 to add to its name \\"d'Estaing\\". In effect : * Edmond Giscard (1894‚Äì1982) is a descendant: ** fourth generation of Lucie Madeleine d'Estaing (Saint-Babel 1769-1844); ** ninth generation of Joseph Destaing (Jabrun 1648 - Jabrun 1711]), son of Joachim Destaing and Suzanne Paulet, self-styled noble, lord of R√©quistat and of Boissi√®re, with no known kinship with Jean d'Estaing who bought the Ch√¢teau de R√©quistat around 1669 to give to his daughter Marie-Claire in 1772. This Joachim was condemned as a usurper of nobility by a judgement of 5 May 1667. He is the ancestor from whom the Giscard d'Estaings took their name.

He asserted that an accidentally-appearing profitable variety cannot be preserved by natural selection in the population, but should be 'swamped' with ordinary traits. Population genetics helped to overcome this logical difficulty. Jenkin‚Äôs article was published anonymously in the North British Review in June 1867. It took Darwin a year and a half to discover that the author was Fleeming Jenkin, Regius Professor of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. The critical article was most valuable to Darwin. In 1869 he wrote to Alfred Russell Wallace: \\"Fleming Jenkyn‚Äôs arguments have convinced me\\". Darwin's son Francis said that Jenkin‚Äôs critique was the most valuable ever made on his father's views. Jenkin‚Äôs article was a critique intended to be based entirely on science, unlike most other critiques which were based on religion. Jenkin humorously said in his article \\"we are asked to believe\\", suggesting he opposed the theory because it was too much like a religion. In his article Jenkin stated that organisms could obtain adaptations through natural selection, but would never gain whole new organs for smell, hearing or sight if they had never possessed them. Jenkin further asserted that once selective pressure was removed, the population would revert to its original condition. He then introduced the 'swamping argument' to deny the possibility that an occasional monstrous individual, a saltation, could supply an escape from this state of affairs and give rise to a permanent adaptation. Jenkin made a mathematical calculation for his argument Jenkin made a mistake in his calculation stating the chances are ‚Äúfifty to one‚Äù where it should have been ‚Äúten thousand to one‚Äù. He continued his essay with a melodramatic story to elaborate on his calculation Darwin agreed that a variation originating in a single individual would not spread across a population, and would invariably be lost. Darwin stated to his colleagues that he was always aware that ‚Äúswamping‚Äù would stamp out saltations. In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species he responded: Darwin concluded that natural selection must instead act upon the normal small variations in any given characteristic across all the individuals in the population. Apart from the swamping argument Jenkin also questioned Darwin‚Äôs calculation of the earth‚Äôs age. This calculation was more worrisome for Darwin as he himself agreed that in the timespan given there would not have been enough time for natural selection to take place. Darwin needed a solution to both the swamping argument for non-saltation‚Äôs and the earths age. Darwin theorized that ‚Äònegative selection‚Äô by the increased destruction of non-adapted specimens would further speed up the process of natural selection. Darwin added this to the fifth edition of ‚ÄúOn the Origin of species‚Äù. This solved for him the problem of swamping in large numbers and would shorten the evolutionary process to fit his own calculated age of the earth. Because the ‚Äòswamping argument‚Äô was mostly anchored in the ‚Äòblending inheritance‚Äô theory. When the ‚Äòblending inheritance‚Äô theory was replaced by mendelian inheritance in the early 1900s the ‚Äòswamping argument‚Äô also became obsolete. Notes Susan W.

Stacy Taus-Bolstad mentioned Burgess and some of his career highlights in her 2005 book Koreans in America alongside comedian Margaret Cho under \\"Famous Korean Americans\\".Taus-Bolstad, Stacy. \\"Koreans in America\\". \\"Lerner Pub Group.\\" March, 2005. https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0822548747/ref=sr_1_4?p=S01U&keywords;=dana+tai+soon+burgess&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1322446908#reader_0822548747\\" In 2006 he retired from dancing due to a bad back. But in 2008 he returned to the stage as a stand-in for one of his dancers, which resulted in a Washington Post review by critic Sarah Kaufman called \\"Retired Burgess Hasn't Lost A Step\\" that said \\"Burgess has emerged as the area's leading dance artist, consistently following his own path and producing distinctive, well-considered works.\\" The performance included the premiere of Hyphen, a surrealist dance work featuring video images by Nam June Paik from the 1960s. In May, 2014 he was quoted in Smithsonian magazine as saying his artistic focus had shifted to exploring the idea of cultural \\"confluence\\".\\"Museums and How the Arts are Presenting Identity So That It Unites, Not Divides\\".

Burgess's choreography has also been commissioned by Ballet Memphis and the Kennedy Center. His work \\"The Nightingale\\" toured to over 70 American cities. Burgess' work has focused on the immigrant experience and cultural divides, which has resulted in several of his performances being showcased on prominent State Department sponsored tours around the world. He has taught, lectured, performed and toured around the world in countries such as Surinam, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Venezuela, Germany, Latvia, Ecuador, Panama, Mexico, Peru, and Cambodia, among others.

In May 2014 he told Smithsonian magazine that his work Confluence, created as part of DTSBDC's residency at National Portrait Gallery, explored ‚Äúan underlying inter-connectedness\\" of all people. When asked if this work was \\"influenced by America‚Äôs increasingly diverse population\\", he said, ‚ÄúYes, I think the cultural terrain is changing as is my company‚Äôs focus.

The work received favorable reviews and significant press attention. In May 2016 Burgess was named the Smithsonian's first-ever choreographer in residence at the National Portrait Gallery.  Youth programs  At the time he founded his dance company, Burgess also established the Moving Forward: Asian American Youth Program, which was a summer program for Asian American youth. The program still operates under the name DTSB Asian American Youth Program, and is a year-round mentoring program for high school students. Feeling \\"caught between different cultural worlds\\" as a child, Burgess has said he created the program as a way for young people to explore identity, artistic self-expression, and their Asian American heritage.Bale, Eric. \\"A Whale of an Effort\\".

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Career Hinshaw graduated from Centennial High School (Compton, California) and was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 11th round of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft out of the University of La Verne. In his second pro season, with the 1981 Reno Silver Sox of the High Class A California League, Hinshaw led the league in runs batted in (131) and hits (189), belted 25 home runs, and batted .371. He was runner-up to Kent Hrbek (.379) for the batting title, and was elected the Cal League's Rookie of the Year.

He appeared in six games, starting five, and collected four hits in 15 at bats, adding three bases on balls. But he did not make the 1983 Padres' roster out of spring training and spent the year at the Triple-A level as the third baseman of the Las Vegas Stars.

Plot Eschewing the traditional rockumentary methods of archival performance and interviews, director Gorman Bechard instead relies on fans to tell the story of the Replacements. Some of these fans are more well known than others, as members of H√ºsker D√º, the Goo Goo Dolls, the Hold Steady, the Decemberists, the Gaslight Anthem, Babes in Toyland, and many other famous musicians retrace the band's story from their humble beginnings in Minneapolis to their legendary onstage breakup on July 4, 1991. The heart of the story, though, comes from \\"ordinary\\" fans. Some saw the band hundreds of times during their tenure; others only saw a show or two.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Lecce. History The cathedral was first built in 1144, but underwent repairs in 1230. It was rebuilt in 1659 by the architect Giuseppe Zimbalo by order of bishop Luigi Pappacoda, whose remains are kept in the altar dedicated to Saint Orontius of Lecce, the patron saint of the city.  Description   Location and Exterior  The northern facade The cathedral is located in the center of the city of Lecce and sits on the southeast corner of the Piazza del Duomo. It is accessible from the piazza through two entrances, one on the north side of the building and another on the west side. The cathedral shares the piazza with other buildings, including the bell tower, the bishop's residence, and the seminary. The principal entrance is found on the northern fa√ßade, which is considered to be a masterpiece of Baroque art. At the center is the portal, accessible by a cascading staircase. Flanking the portal are two massive columns on square bases, outside of which are niches containing statues of Saint Giusto (on the right) and Saint Fortunato (on the left). The entablature, sitting directly above the portal, is crowned by a high balustrade alternating with columns and pilasters, above which, in the center and standing within a grand and highly decorated arch, is a statue of Saint Orontius. The western entrance, found directly across from the archbishop's residence, is divided by fluted pilasters into three vertical sections corresponding to the three naves of the interior. Statues of Peter and Paul flank the entrance. Part of the right side of the fa√ßade is covered by an adjacent diocesan building.  Interior  The cathedral has a Latin cross plan with three naves divided by pilasters and columns, and the main altar is placed at the eastern end of the church. The central nave and the transepts are covered by a wooden ceiling with coffers created in 1685 along with paintings by Giuseppe da Brindisi which show: the Preaching of Saint Orontius, the Protection from the Plague, the Martyrdom of Saint Orontius, and the Last Supper. The central nave The cathedral contains twelve side chapels, each with its own altar. The side chapels are dedicated to (starting on the left side of the nave): * John the Baptist (1682) * Nativity of Jesus which contains a 16th-century creche * the martyrdom of Saint Giusto (1674) * Saint Anthony of Padua (also from 1674) * the Immaculate Conception (1689) * Saint Philip Romolo Neri (1690) * the Crucifixion of Jesus and the Blessed Sacrament (1780) * Saint Orontius of Lecce (1671) * Our Lady of Sorrows * Saint Giusto (1656) * Saint Charles Borromeo * Saint Andrew the Apostle (1687) They are pictorally rich with images by talented artists including Giuseppe da Brindisi, Oronzo Tiso, Gianserio Strafella, G. Domenico Catalano and G. A. Coppola. The main altar is made of marble and gold-plated bronze, and was constructed by bishop Sersale. It was consecrated in 1757 by bishop Sozi Carafa, who also commissioned the large central painting, the Assumption of Mary by Oronzo Tiso (1757) as well as the two lateral images of the Sacrifice of the Prophet Elias and the Sacrifice of Noah after the Flood (1758). The choir stalls and bishop's chair, made of walnut, were designed by Emanuele Manieri and were commissioned by bishop Fabrizio Pignatelli in 1797. The 12th century cathedral crypt underwent Baroque modifications in the 16th century. It has a longitudinal space that contains two Baroque chapels with paintings that is crossed by a long corridor consisting of ninety-two columns with capitals decorated with human figures.  Bell tower  The cathedral's belltower The cathedral at night The bell tower was constructed in 1661-1662 by Lecce architect Giuseppe Zimbalo at the request of bishop Luigi Pappacoda. It was built to replace the previous Norman bell tower, erected by Goffredo d'Altavilla, which crumbled at the beginning of the 17th century. It has a square shape and appears to be made up of five tapered levels, the last of which is surmounted by an octagonal majolica dome, on which there is an iron statue of Sant'Oronzo. The top four floors have a single window on each side, and each has a balustrade going completely around its perimeter. Engraved on plaques located over the mullioned windows are Latin inscriptions taken from the writings of Giovanni Lecce Camillo Palma. At a height of 72 meters,Cattedrale di Lecce the bell tower offers views of the Adriatic Sea, and on clear days even the mountains of Albania are visible. It leans slightly due to a partly sunken foundation.

Plot The story is told as a flashback of the adult Mary (Irina Brook) returning to Misselthwaite Manor after World War I, during which she worked as a nurse in a hospital. She looks for the key to the secret garden, but doesn't find it, so she sits down and remembers her childhood. The main story begins in colonial India with the young, neglected, and selfish Mary Lennox (Gennie James) waking in the night to find her servants not answering and her parents having a late dinner party. The dinner guests discuss a cholera epidemic that is infesting the region, but Mary's vain shallow mother cares only about attending another party. Only moments later, Colonel Lennox collapses. The following morning, Mary wakes to find her parents dying and all their servants either dead or fled. She is discovered by English officers and is soon sent to live with a friend of the family named Mr. Craven (Derek Jacobi), even though the two of them have never before met. Mary is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated home on the moors of Yorkshire. She is shocked and disappointed when the servants do not defer to her as they did in India. While adjusting to life in England, Mary meets the maid Martha (Cassie Stuart) who tells her the story of a secret walled garden that was locked up, with the key thrown away, after the late Mrs. Craven died there. Mary distracts herself from her loneliness and boredom by searching for the door to this garden. Eventually, she finds both door and key, only to learn that the garden has fallen to ruin. With the help of Martha's brother Dickon (Barret Oliver), Mary works to revive the garden. Meanwhile, inside Misselthwaite Manor, Mary frequently wakes in the night to the ghostly sounds of sobbing. The servants insist that the sound is the wind, but one night Mary goes exploring and discovers Mr. Craven's bed-bound son Colin (Jadrien Steele), who weeps incessantly because he is convinced he is going to die. Everyone in the house hates him and hopes he will finally die because of his bad temper. The two gradually become friends as Mary tells him about his mother's garden and how she and Dickon have been restoring it. At last Colin is curious enough that he demands to see this garden. With Dickon's help, Mary take Colin in his wheelchair to visit the garden in secret. Soon Colin declares that the garden must be magic, which inspires him to take his first steps unassisted. The house gardener Ben Weatherstaff (Michael Hordern), who has been spying on the children, witnesses this and is amazed. Ben offers to help revive the garden as well, and Colin tries to learn to stand and walk by himself. Far away in London, Mr. Craven receives a letter from Dickon's mother Susan insisting he return to Misselthwaite Manor at once.

It was first built in the Middle Ages, and was strengthened by Charles V in 1539, to a design by the architect Gian Giacomo dell‚ÄôAcaya. To build this fortress two constructions were pulled down: the Chapel of the Trinity and the Monastery of the Benedictine Order of the Saint Cross. The castle did not have only defensive functions, in the 18th century one of its rooms was used as a theatre. From 1870 to 1979 it was used as military district. Nowadays it is the seat of the Cultural Affairs of the township of Lecce, a backdrop for many cultural initiatives. Visitors can remain charmed with the delicate ornaments of the interiors: the capitals and the decorated big room, with imposing big stained glass windows. The rooms of the upstairs are sustained by imposing stone columns. There is a legend linked with this castle: it tells that the family which owned this castle in the 14th century, the Orsini del Balzo family, kept a white bear in the moat of the castle. This animal was a status symbol and, at the same time, it scared prowlers.

Biography  Pollard was born during The Blitz in 1942 and brought up a Londoner. After working in the furniture trade and serving his articles in accountancy, he escaped to the University of Sussex where he was given his three degrees in English Literature, the History of Ideas, and Philosophy. The last of these, a doctorate, was awarded on his fortieth birthday and was published as 'The Poetry of Keats: Language and Experience' and is a Heideggerian approach to the poet. Heidegger's late critiques of the German poets H√∂lderlin, M√∂rike and Rilke are applied here for the first time to an English poet. Pollard has worked at the Universities of Essex and Sussex and spent a year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as a Lady Davis Scholar. He edited the KWIC Concordance to Keats' Letters based on the Rider K. Rollins edition published by Harvard University Press. He has also published on Blake and Nietzsche, his latest being a novel, 'Nietzsche's Footfalls', a meditation on the philosopher and his times, his relation to his sister and Nazism and especially to Wagner. Pollard has published five volumes of poetry, 'patricides', 'Risk of Skin', 'Self-Portraits' (Waterloo Press), 'bedbound' (Perdika Press) and 'Finis-terre' (Agenda Editions), a Poetry Book Society recommendation and 'Three Artists (Lapwing Press).

It was written by Jason Pebworth, Jon Shave, George Astasio, Kyle Abrahams, Peter Ighile, Mariah Young-Jones and Rowan Martin, and produced by The Invisible Men in collaboration with Parker & James. The song premiered in May 2011 during a music festival in Morocco, and was promoted with various snippets and teasers in addition to an advertisement for the Nokia N8. It is an electropop song with elements of dubstep. It is the final song this lineup released following them disbanding and the original lineup reforming. \\"Freedom\\" was due for release as the lead single from their anticipated eighth studio album, although the song was cancelled as an official single and instead made a free digital download via Amazon. Despite the controversy surrounding its release, the song received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its sound and the use of dubstep. The music video, which was directed by Sean De Sparigo and filmed in July 2011, features the Sugababes in an underground club. The trio performed \\"Freedom\\" at the T4 on the Beach festival on 10 July 2011. Background Following the release of their seventh studio album Sweet 7, which was met with poor reviews and low sales, it was confirmed that the Sugababes had begun work on their eighth studio album. In February 2011, group member Heidi Range stated that the Sugababes were aiming to finish the album in time for a summer 2011 release. She revealed that the group completed a song which they believed could be the album's lead single. The Sugababes confirmed in May 2011 that they would premiere \\"Freedom\\" at the Mawazine Festival in Morocco. In July 2011, the group's management confirmed that the group had left their longtime record company Island Records and signed a three-album deal with Sony's RCA label. The artwork for \\"Freedom\\" was revealed in August 2011; it features the Sugababes on a sofa wearing deep green clothing. Composition and lyrics \\"Freedom\\" was written by Jason Pebworth, Jon Shave, George Astasio, Kyle Abrahams, Peter Ighile, Mariah Young-Jones and Rowan Martin. Pebworth, Shave and Astasio produced the song under their stage name The Invisible Men, in collaboration with Parker & James, consisting of Abrahams and Ighile. \\"Freedom\\" is an electropop song with elements of dubstep. It is backed by synthesizers with a \\"moody\\" arrangement. According to the British website Orange, \\"Freedom\\" is a \\"controlled, steady anthem\\" with a \\"darker, deeper and more soulful\\" sound. During the pre-chorus, the group chants the lines \\"So raise your hands / One fist in the air / For free-ee-ee- ee dom-dom-dom\\" over a prominent dubstep beat. Sugababes member Amelle Berrabah interpreted the track as about \\"being free, liberated and being powerful\\". Release and reception Heidi Range stated in February 2011 that the Sugababes completed a potential lead single for the album. A snippet of \\"Freedom\\" appeared online on 1 June 2011 as part of an advertising campaign for the Nokia N8. In July 2011, the Sugababes released a teaser of the song online, while the full version premiered online in August 2011. \\"Freedom\\" was due to be officially released on 5 September 2011, although the date was pushed back to 25 September. The song was made available to pre-order on the iTunes Store, however, four days before its release date, the pre-order link was removed and \\"Freedom\\" was cancelled as an official single. Instead, the song was released as a free digital download via Amazon. The decision was clarified in a statement posted on the Sugababes' official Facebook page: \\"As a thank you to their fans, the Sugababes are offering their new single, 'Freedom' as a free download via Amazon.\\" Several media outlets reported that the single's release was cancelled due to major radio stations' reluctance to play the song, as well as the presumption that it would underperform in the charts. Despite the controversy surrounding its release, \\"Freedom\\" received positive reviews from critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it a four out of five star rating, and wrote: \\"Truth be told, by the time the head-spinning dubstep moment kicks in, we're too busy throwing our finest shapes to care who's in the band anyway.\\" A journalist from Orange regarded \\"Freedom\\" as an \\"unusual club track\\", and praised it as a \\"fine addition\\" to the Sugababes' collection of songs. Promotion The music video for \\"Freedom\\" was directed by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single \\"Freak like Me\\". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: \\"One of the interesting things for the concept for this video is that we knew we had to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were at the top of their game.\\" The video made its premiere in August 2011. A behind the scenes clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video. The Sugababes performed \\"Freedom\\" on 10 July 2011 at the T4 on the Beach festival. It was the first performance of the song on television, in which group member Jade Ewen told 4Music that they were \\"really excited about it.\\" The group performed an acoustic version of the song in September 2011 on the TV series Super Saturday. In September 2011, the trio performed \\"Freedom\\" on Sam and Mark's television series Big Friday Wind Up, and at London's nightclub G-A-Y, where they wore coordinating rubber outfits.

It is set in a fictional seaside town called Sugartown, credited as the home of rock and still the site of the struggling Burr's rock factory. Plot Jason Burr (Shaun Dooley) owns the Burr's rock factory and it trying to keep it afloat. His brother, Max Burr (Tom Ellis), has plans to redevelop Sugartown as a modern leisure resort. These plans do not include the factory. Opposing these plans, local residents Carmen (Georgia King) and Travis (Rob Kendrick) hit upon Sugartown's history of dance as a possible way to restore the town's fortunes. Tensions between the brothers are not helped by the fact that both are in love with Emily (Miranda Raison) and the drama begins on the evening of Jason's proposal to her. Broadcast and reception Broadcast during the 22:35 slot on BBC1, the first episode rated below average with 2.00 million viewers (13.72% audience share) in the provisional BARB overnight ratings. It was beaten in the ratings by The Lovely Bones on Channel 4 and fell below the slot average of 2.39m (15.4% audience share) for BBC1 for the year to date. The second episode broadcast was watched by 1.5 million instead. Once again, this failed to reach the slot average of 2.39 million, but unlike the first episode, missed the average by just under one million viewers. The opening episode received poor reviews from The Guardian's Sam Wollaston who branded it \\"lame, tired, predictable and uninteresting\\"; Christopher Hooton, of the Metro, who described it as a \\"3-part disaster-piece\\" and \\"pretty much beyond repair\\"; and Paddy Shennan, in the Liverpool Echo, who described the actors as \\"playing cardboard cutouts acting out a painful, pitiful pathetic and patronising plot\\". Writing in The Stage, Harry Venning praised the first ten minutes before adding that the goodwill they generated \\"was squandered in the truly dreadful 50 minutes that followed\\". Tom Sutcliffe, in The Independent described it as a mis-scheduled children's programme, writing, \\"it's hard to see Sugartown as anything else, so guileless is its plotting and so jauntily empty of threat are its characterisations.\\" Sutcliffe conceded that it was not a bad show of its type but doubted it would appeal to many, summarizing it as \\"cocoa for the mind\\". Writing in The Herald, Alan Morrison judged that \\"cliche is the stuff that Sugartown is made of\\" but that its feel good simplicity was of a piece with Sunday night TV and that \\"Sugartown is ready to wrap itself around viewers for the next two weeks like a snuggly blanket on the living- room sofa\\". In conclusion he stated that Sugartown \\"won‚Äôt (and needn‚Äôt) do a whole lot more than satisfy the sweet tooth of a Sunday-night audience.\\" In The Scotsman, Paul Whitelaw, was scathing about the general type of cosy northern comedy dramas and Sugatown in particular. He compared it unfavourably with Victoria Wood and Ealing Comedy and finished by saying, \\"Pastel-coloured in sugary shades of CBBC, it should be studiously avoided if you're lactose intolerant or simply intolerant of vacuous entertainment.\\" Jane Murphy, for Orange, disagreed with the late airing time, saying that \\"surely this is the kind of please-everyone programme that would fit neatly into the just-past- Sunday-teatime slot.\\" For CultBox, David Lewis gave a three star review, saying that the balance between comedy and drama \\"doesn't quite work\\" and \\"while the dialogue sparkles, the action does not.\\" In the Radio Times, Alison Graham was extremely negative, stating \\"After ten minutes of this gormless show you‚Äôll feel as if you‚Äôre caught up in a dreadful theme-park ride that hurls you through dank tunnels of clich√©.\\" She later summarized her feelings on her Radio Times blog with the simple statement, \\"It made me want to die.\\" The Daily Telegraph listed all three episodes in their \\"TV Highlights\\" section for the day. However, they did not give it wholehearted support, describing episode one as a type of comedy that \\"has seen better days\\" but was \\"not without charm\\". Episode two received the comment \\"Admittedly it isn't often very funny, but it's warm and entertaining enough.\\" Finally, episode three gained this assessment, \\"It's not groundbreaking, but Sue Johnston is as reliable as ever, and at least it doesn't have a laughter track.\\" Episodes Sugartown was released on region 2 DVD on 5 September 2011. { width=\\"100%\\" ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"# ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"Total ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"Title ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"Directed by ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"Written by ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"Original air date ! style=\\"background:#FFA700;\\"UK viewers (audience share) |} References External links  Sugartown on the Shed Media Scotland website Category:BBC Television shows Category:2011 British television series debuts Category:Television shows set in Yorkshire Category:Filey ","title":"Sugartown (TV series)"},{"id":"32529634","text":"Vulcan/Kirkcaldy Aerodrome, , is located southwest of Vulcan, Alberta, Canada.

In 1958, with approximately 3,000 vehicles manufactured, production ended. Georges had inherited the business from his father, Charles Mochet (1880‚Äì1934) under whose leadership it had, after the First World War, produced children's‚Äô pedal cars and, between 1924 and 1934, the 'V√©locar' lightweight, pedal-powered, cycle- car. In 1934, the firm's revolutionary 'V√©lo-V√©locar' recumbent bicycles, ridden to record-breaking speeds by Francis Faure, were banned from cycling competitions by the Union Cycliste Internationale. Charles Mochet died soon after. The continuation of recumbent cycle production and of the cycle-cars, popular in occupied, no-petrol France, and the subsequent switch to micro-cars under Georges after the Second World War was therefore a direct evolution from the pre-war business built up by his father. Under Georges Mochet the cars were powered by small single cylinder two stroke Ydral engines initially of 100 cc installed at the back and driving the rear wheels. By the time manufacturing ended, the engine size had increased to 175 cc. During this time the body work also evolved, with improved weather protection a welcome aspect of later models. There is a Mochet three-wheeler cycle car in a museum dating from 1947, described by one commentator as ‚Äúvery rustic‚Äù, but regular production dates from approximately 1950 which some sources take as marking the birth of the Mochet autobusiness. 1949 or 1950 saw the arrival of the ‚ÄúType K‚Äù cycle-car with its 100 cc engine. This was replaced in 1952 by the ‚ÄúType CM Luxe‚Äù, the engine size now increased to 125 cc. The ‚ÄúType CM Grand luxe‚Äù for 1953 retained the 125 cc and added a new ‚Äúponton‚Äù format body, with headlights set into the front wings. The Mochet now looked like a normal car, but smaller, at just 2550 mm long and 1130 mm wide, recalling the pedal cars produced under the patron‚Äôs father before the First World War. Despite the modern body-work the 1953 ‚ÄúCM Grand Luxe‚Äù retained the same 1700 mm wheelbase and 980 mm front-track of the original ‚ÄúType K‚Äù cycle-car. In October 1953, at the Paris Motor Show, Mochet exhibited a modern looking small cabriolet bodied car closer in size to a (small) normal car. The car was powered by a twin cylinder 748cc unit providing a claimed 40 hp of output. The unit was based on the engines used by the BMW motor bikes used by the police. However, this Mochet 750 never progressed beyond the prototype stage.  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography * Harald H.

This one describes his conduction of a service-event that resulted in Truman's decision to enter the Korean War. When Fields began his tenure at the White House in 1931, senators from the U.S. South frequently addressed him with the racially condescending term \\"boy\\", and an obvious racial hierarchy existed between white and black White House house staff, with whites dominating. While the attitudes of most southern U.S. senators would not begin to change until the advent of the Civil Rights Movement, Roosevelt took it upon himself to remove racial tensions among the house staff by making it all black.Fields, Alonzo.

After his retirement in 1960, Fields published My 21 Years in the White House, in which he wove together his private papers and cryptic journals, written while serving, with his recollections. Although restrained, his memoir nonetheless provides a uniquely intimate primary source account of the U.S. presidents he served, several who came to trust Fields as a close personal friend. Fields reports, for example, that he was present when Roosevelt was first informed of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and that Roosevelt \\"broke down completely\\" during that moment, and also emoted racial slurs against the Japanese before gaining control. Truman was especially close with Fields and even related with him as an emotional confidant at times, and the two at one point sat together for a portrait.

Organized in mid-1918 at Camp Sheridan, the regiment was preparing to go overseas with the 9th Division when the war ended. It was demobilized shortly thereafter.  History  The 67th Infantry Regiment was constituted on 5 July 1918 in the Regular Army and organized during the same month with the new 9th Division at Camp Sheridan from a cadre of the 45th Infantry Regiment. The new unit was commanded by Major Byard Sneed, who was replaced by Colonel Moor N. Falls from mid-August. Among the officers from the cadre was future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, who became a first lieutenant in the regiment. Assigned to the 17th Infantry Brigade together with the 45th, the regiment was brought up to strength with draftees. The division began systematic training in August and on 28 October its advance detachment moved to Camp Mills to prepare for overseas departure, delayed by a curtailment of training activities during September and October due to Spanish flu. Four soldiers of the division were among those who died of the disease on one of the deadliest days in terms of influenza deaths at Camp Sheridan, 22 October. When the Armistice was signed on 11 November, all overseas movements were suspended and the advance detachment returned to Camp Sheridan. In December, the regiment was split up, with the 1st Battalion moving to Camp McClellan and the 3rd Battalion to Camp Shelby for garrison duty. Demobilization was ordered on 17 January 1919 and completed on 15 February.

They are primarily known for racing Minis in the UK MINI Challenge, and being successful in their endeavours. They also competed in the 2010 BTCC season in a pair of BMW 320si racing cars. MINI Challenge The team was formed in 2002 to allow Arthur Forster to race in the UK MINI Challenge. His previous experience racing Ford Fiestas in the 1994 Ford Fiesta Challenge stood him in good stead and he was instantly challenging for race wins, and indeed took a few top place finishes in his maiden season. In 2004, Arthur finished the season on level points, but missed out on the title on countback. He rectified this by becoming the Challenge Champion in 2005. Also during the 2005 season Martin Depper joined the team, initially competing in the Cooper Class, and moving up to the Club Class the following season (in which he finished third in class). After a tough 2007 season, in which Arthur had moved to take a team manager role, Martin emulated Arthur's success during 2008 and took the Challenge Championship. Arthur‚Äôs return to the race seat in the 2008 season was not as successful with some expensive repair bills and broken bones being his reward. However, with both having tasted success in the MINI Challenge, the team began to look at other race series, and Martin, being a (in his own words) \\"let's take a big step\\" person, made the suggestion of the BTCC. Knowing that such a big leap would require time to prepare for, the team continued competing in the MINI challenge for their 8th consecutive season whilst preparing for the BTCC in the background. Move to BTCC In October 2009 Forster Motorsport announced their intentions to join the next season of the British Touring Car Championship, a statement they reiterated on their own website in January 2010. The team entered two BMW 320si race cars, the cars having previously been campaigned by Mat Jackson. Martin raced in car number 30, whilst Arthur took car number 37. Both had been upgraded to that season‚Äôs specification for the BMW touring cars. The cars debuted at the BTCC‚Äôs 2010 Media Day at Brands Hatch, however only one car was able to compete at their first round of the 2010 season at Rockingham Circuit. The team had decided that their pre-season preparations had only been \\"satisfactory\\" and so postponed their start to the season until Round 2 at Rockingham to allow further time for testing and preparation. However, despite both cars being ready, only Arthur was able to compete as Martin became stranded in the US due to the travel disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud over Europe. Arthur had a successful weekend at Rockingham, finishing all three races. However, as the season progressed the team quickly became back markers during the races. Neither driver scored any championship points, and as a result the team also finished on 0 points, one of three teams to finish in such a position (the other two being Central Racing Group and AmD MIlltek Racing.com). Martin's record for the series was nine rounds not attended (Thruxton, Rockingham, and Knockhill), three Did Not Starts (all at Donnington), six retirements, a 12th place, a 13th place, four 14th places, three 15th places, a 16th place, and a 20th place. Arthur's record for the series was two rounds not attended (Thruxton and Knockhill), four retirements, one Not Classified, two 13th places, two 14th places, three 15th places, four 16th places, four 17th places, one 18th place, one 19th place, and two 20th places. Return to the MINI Challenge After a disappointing season in the BTCC, and having made comments that they would be competing in the 2011 BTCC season, Forster reappeared in the MINI Challenge. Both drivers are competing in the JCW Class, Martin in car number 30 and Arthur in car number 3. By the end of round 9 of the series the team had suffered a number of Did Not Start (DNS) and Did Not Finish (DNF) results for both drivers. This meant that approaching the half way mark in the season Martin was sat in 11th position on 60 points and Arthur in 20th position with 33 points. However, neither driver had appeared at rounds 8 or 9.

The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan (1st ed, 2004), p. 218, It was also released as the lead single from the album and reached #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 The song later appeared on several Dylan compilation albums including Biograph, in 1985, and Dylan (three-disc version), in 2007. Lyrics and music According to Dylan, \\"On a Night Like This\\" was not a typical song for him to write, saying that it \\"comes off as sort of like a drunk man who's temporarily sober.\\" Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin found the song a disappointing start to Planet Waves. However, he did acknowledge some positive features: that \\"playing swings\\" and that Dylan is in good voice. He also acknowledges some clever lyrics. For example, he sees in the lines: :Build a fire, throw on logs :And listen to it hiss :And let it burn, burn, burn, burn a clever take on Jack Kerouac's use of the phrase \\"burn, burn, burn\\" in On the Road in which Dylan's meaning is the opposite of Kerouac'S. He also finds amusement in Dylan's reference to Fats Domino and Dylan's own \\"The Man in Me\\" in the lines: :Let the four winds blow :Around this old cabin door Author Oliver Trager noted the \\"rustic\\" feel resulting from the \\"twangy, loose musicianship\\" and that song produces visceral effects in allowing the listener to feel the window frost and smell the burning wood described in the song. Trager particularly praises Dylan's harmonica and Garth Hudson's accordion playing. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine rates the song's \\"unassuming nature\\" as a \\"virtue.\\" Billboard described the song as \\"a spunky tune about reminiscences and things that sure feel right\\" and stated that Dylan's vocal performance sounded strained. Cover versions Los Lobos recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of the 2003 film Masked and Anonymous. Buckwheat Zydeco covered the song on his 1987 album On a Night Like This.

He was born in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland and is a graduate of the University of Ulster having also attended Harvard for a two-week course and the University of North Carolina. During his time on The Apprentice, he gained the nickname \\"Jedi Jim\\" due to his persuasive abilities and use of mind games. Eastwood is also a former all-Ireland cycling champion.  The Apprentice  In 2011, Eastwood appeared on the seventh series of The Apprentice. He started out well, shining individually despite being on the losing team for three of the first four tasks. He came to prominence on the show after persuading his team leader Leon Doyle to select a different person to bring back into the boardroom after he had already decided Jim would be one of the two candidates. Eastwood then drifted for the next few tasks, only just avoiding being fired in week 5 after a poor product naming decision. From then on he was branded \\"evil\\" and was branded by Lord Sugar's aide at the time Nick Hewer as \\"spooky\\" http://metro.co.uk/2011/06/21/nick-hewer-slams-the- apprentices-manipulative-jim-eastwood-52254/ because of his apparent decision to use his abilities of persuasion more aggressively, having another narrow escape in week 7 as Project Manager, when his mistake in negotiation over advertising space in the Hip Replacement magazine cost the team victory. However, Eastwood had a return to form in week 9, when he not only designed a well-received luxury biscuit called Special Stars, but also helped secure the biggest victory ever seen in the UK Apprentice, by delivering a pitch to Asda that persuaded them to place an order of 800,000 units. Eastwood once again shone in the reinvestment task with huge sales of umbrellas, although his performance, and that of Susan Ma, was overshadowed by the bizarre decisions of his project manager Natasha Scribbins, who failed to understand the point of the task and refused to reinvest on the second day in any substantial quantity. Eastwood reached the final despite a second disastrous loss as project manager, in which Venture's concept for a Mexican restaurant lost in every single category to Logic, made worse by the failure to produce any financial plan for the pitch. Jim's survival was mostly a result of Natasha taking a total backseat on the task, despite possessing a degree in hospitality, but he was nonetheless tipped for victory by previous candidates. Though he was dubbed \\"The World's Greatest Salesman\\" by Lord Sugar, he failed to win as the interviewers considered his business plan an attempt to ingratiate himself with Lord Sugar.  After The Apprentice  After The Apprentice, Eastwood set up his own business as a public speaker. His nickname has also been featured on a t-shirt, one of which was given by Eastwood to host Dara √ì Briain on The Apprentice: You're Hired!.

It is a tributary of the Ega River, corresponding to the Ebro basin, that runs entirely through the province of √Ålava crossing the region of Monta√±a Alavesa. The river begins in the Izki Natural Park and it heads east passing through the towns Corres and Bujanda to flow into the Ega River near Santa Cruz de Campezo after obtaining water from the Berr√≥n River. The Izki river forms part of the ZEC (Zona de Especial Conservaci√≥n-The Zone of Special Conservation) Ega-Berr√≥n (previously named LIC Ega-Berr√≥n ES2110020) and in terms of fauna species of interest, the presence of the European mink (Mustela lutreola), a cataloged mammal \\"in danger of extinction\\", stands out . Also present in its waters is another mustelid who in the past years has seen an increase in its populations: The nutria (Lutra lutra), for which it has been classified as an Area of Special Interest for the Species Management Plan drawn up by Diputaci√≥n Foral de √Ålava, the Provincial Council of √Ålava.  The river's course  The Izki River has a length of 15.74 km and it constitutes the central hydrologic axis of the National Park of Izki, its basin occupying about 60 % of its surface. Practically all of its basin is located in an extensive forested area occupied by sands, forming a valley characterized by the existence of a large number of short-distance water courses. Upon arriving at an abrupt area dominated by calcarenite near Corres, the valley is encased in the Corres ravine, a beautiful gorge located between the Soila mountains (990 m) and the Muela (1056 m) that opens up to reach a wide alluvial plain at its convergence with the Berr√≥n River. At that point its average annual flow is 610 L/s. In the summer, the dry season can be very marked, suffering strong drops in continuous dry periods, becoming dull in some sections. Regarding hydraulic uses, it is worth highlighting the hydraulic infrastructure installed in the Izki River ravine which consists of a dam (Aranbaltza dam) from which a surface channel starts that transports an average of 200-300 L/s. Another similar channel starts from the Berr√≥n river, north of the town of Atauri. Both canals join in a surface deposit located near Bujanda, whose altitude (with an elevation difference of about 70m) is used by a small hydroelectric plant in Anto√±ana, built in 1905 and which was put into operation again in 2014.

Stackpole featuring Robert E. Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero of the same name, a novelization of the feature film of the same name. It was first published in paperback by Berkley Books in 2011. An earlier novel of the same name by L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter and Catherine Crook de Camp, based on the original film of which the 2011 version was a remake, was published by Bantam Books in 1982. Plot summary Chapters 1-11 retell the story of the hero's youth from his birth through the murder of his father and destruction of his village by raiders to the eve of the Battle of Venarium. Stackpole's version of these events is compatible with the account established in the original tales by Howard, the character's creator, references to which he incorporates into his text. In the wake of Venarium Conan ventures into an unforgiving world where he survives as a thief, pirate, and warrior on a path of wanton adventure and women. Chapters 12-33, set years later in the wake of his piratical career on the Black Coast and subsequent sojourn in the Black Kingdoms, relate how Conan chances upon the warlord responsible for his tribe's destruction. As he tracks Khalar Zym, Conan battles monsters, Zym's henchmen, and Marique, a powerful witch. Reception Reviewer Don D'Ammassa, noting the book's status as a \\"[n]ovelization of the really awful third Conan movie,\\" feels \\"[t]he dialogue is flat and uninteresting\\" and \\"[t]he story is not much better. The book is still an improvement on the movie, which I could barely watch, but given the limitations of the source material, there was no way that the author was going to turn this into an interesting story.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" (review on Critical Mass).

In 1948, she graduated from Macon‚Äôs Hudson High School and married James Otis Mobley. Mobley and her husband moved to California three years later. Over the course of her life, she served on the boards of over 20 organizations, in fields including education, healthcare, water ratemaking, and services for the elderly. She is particularly known for her involvement in the establishment of Martin Luther King Hospital. The McCone Commission convened after the 1965 Watts riots identified deficiencies in health services available in South Los Angeles and made recommendations for improvements in these services. As part of implementing these recommendations, Mobley, along with Mary Henry, Caffie Green, Johnnie Taylor, and Nola Carter, pushed for the establishment of a major hospital in South Los Angeles. Their effort culminated in the opening of Martin Luther King Hospital in 1972. The same activists were a driving force behind the 1966 establishment of the Charles R.

The AFCI represents trained, experienced and professional Film Commissioners and their offices and staff, sets standards and provides professional education, offers training and business services in the field of Film Commissioning, and provides regular marketing and network opportunities in Hollywood and around the world for Film Commissions. History The AFCI was founded in 1975 to serve the growing needs of on-location film and television production. Originally, the AFCI was formed by a small group of film commissioners who wanted to share information and learn from one another‚Äôs experiences. The AFCI incorporated in Washington, D.C. in 1983. Since then, the AFCI has expanded into a worldwide network of more than 360 commissions from 40 countries on every continent except Antarctica. Members Members of the AFCI are Film Commissions from around the world. A film commission is a purpose-built organization or department set up by an interested city, county, state / province or federal government with the specific mandate of promoting and developing filming activity within the jurisdiction. The primary goal of any film commission is to attract film and video production to an area in order to accrue locally-realized benefits from hiring local crews and talent, renting local equipment, using hotel rooms, rental cars, catering services, or any number of goods and services supplied on location. In other words, Film Offices attract Film & TV productions to their locations, and then ensure that the location capitalizes on that production activity. Member Film Commissions have typically been established by cities, counties, states / provinces or federal governments, and are generally operated and funded by various agencies of government, such as the governor‚Äôs office, the mayor‚Äôs office, chambers of commerce, convention and visitors‚Äô bureaus, tourism offices and business and economic development departments.

AFCI Locations Show In 1985, the AFCI partnered with the American Film Marketing Association to host Location Expo, the first on-location trade show for film and television production. Film Commissions from around the world gathered to promote their locations and services to American producers. The first Location Expo attracted 60 film commissioners and some 1,200 people from the film industry to a Los Angeles exhibition site. During the next four years, the Expo‚Äôs space demands increased so that by 1990 the show had to be held at a site different from the AFM conference. Attendance tripled. Then in 1991, Expo relocated with the AFM to Santa Monica. The annual trade show, now an AFCI-sponsored event and known as the AFCI Global Finance and Locations Show, soon became too large to be held in conjunction with AFM, moved its event to early spring, and welcomes over 200+ film commissions and commercial affiliates exhibiting their services to more than 3,000 delegates. The AFCI has been a sponsor of the Location Managers Guild Awards since their inaugural event in 2014, which is currently scheduled to coincide with the AFCI Location Show to take advantage of the number of film commissioners and international location professionals attending the show. A representative of the AFCI has typically been the presenter for the award for best film commission. Cineposium Cineposium is an educational and networking event for film commissions first held in 1976. A program of educational seminars, it is designed to teach film commissioners about the management and processes of the film commission business. The event rotates among its active members, with recent locations including Jecheon (2013), New York (2014), Barcelona (2015), Atlanta (2016), and Los Angeles (2017). The AFCI also participates in a number of other film festivals and markets, sponsoring panels and events at the American Film Market, Berlinale, Busan Film Festival, Festival de Cannes, and Sundance Film Festival. AFCI Training AFCI offers multiple levels of training to members and non-members. From the entry level Film Commission Fundamentals online class to Master Classes and the Certified Film Commissioner program, AFCI members are the best trained in the world. AFCI also provides a variety of networking opportunities so members can market their local jurisdictions, educate themselves and their staff on cutting-edge production trends that impact filming on location.

Built in the Gothic Revival style at a cost of ¬£160,000 (¬£ in ), it was inaugurated for the governance of the Municipal Borough of Rochdale on 27 September 1871. The architect, William Henry Crossland, was the winner of a competition held in 1864 to design a new Town Hall. It had a clock tower topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of Saint George and the Dragon, both of which were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883, leaving the building without a spire for four years. A new stone clock tower and spire in the style of Manchester Town Hall was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, and erected in 1887. Art critic Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as possessing a \\"rare picturesque beauty\\". Its stained glass windows are credited as \\"the finest modern examples of their kind\\". The building came to the attention of Adolf Hitler, who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had the United Kingdom been defeated in the Second World War. History Rochdale had developed into an increasingly large, populous, and prosperous urban mill town since the Industrial Revolution. Its newly built rail and canal network, and numerous factories, resulted in the town being \\"remarkable for many wealthy merchants\\".. In January 1856 the electorate of the Rochdale constituency petitioned the Privy Council for the grant of a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, to constitute the town as a municipal borough. This would give it limited political autonomy via an elected town council, comprising a mayor, aldermen, and councillors, to oversee local affairs. The petition was successful and the charter was granted in September 1856. The newly formed Rochdale Corporation‚Äîthe local authority for the Municipal Borough of Rochdale‚Äîsuggested plans to build a town hall in which to conduct its business in May 1858. The site of an abandoned 17th century house known as the Wood was proposed. Six months later, in April 1860, Rochdale Corporation arranged to buy the site on the outskirts of the town centre for ¬£4,730 (¬£ in ). However, plans were shelved due to lengthy negotiations and increasing land prices. In January 1864 the scheme resumed with a new budget of ¬£20,000 (¬£ in ). The wood and surrounding area were cleared, but it is unknown what became of the dispossessed; there was no legal requirement for the authorities to rehouse the former inhabitants.. A design competition to find a \\"neat and elegant building\\" was held by the Rochdale Corporation,. who offered the winning architect a prize of ¬£100 (¬£ in ), and a Maltese cross souvenir. From the 27 entries received, William Henry Crossland's was chosen. The Rochdale-born Radical and Liberal statesman John Bright laid the foundation stone on 31 March 1866. Construction was complete by 1871 although the cost had, by then, increased beyond expectations from the projected ¬£40,000 to ¬£160,000 (¬£ in ). The Town Hall was one of several built in the textile towns of North West England following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but is one of only two in Greater Manchester built in the Gothic style. Between the setting of the foundation stone and the building's completion, revisions and additions were made to the original design. Money was \\"lavished\\" upon the decor and inventory, and the extra expenditure did not escape the ire of its critics. The cost of the building increased year-on-year through a combination of mismanagement, overspending and \\"unauthorised work\\". Public criticism of the high cost was aimed at Crossland and the Mayor of Rochdale, George Leach Ashworth, who oversaw the work. Nevertheless, Rochdale Town Hall was ultimately celebrated as \\"a source of pride\\", and its completion prompted celebration and rejoicing; it transformed a \\"derelict and marshy riverbank in to a huge romantic Gothic plaza\\". The opening ceremony on 27 September 1871 was performed by Mayor Ashworth, who had been instrumental in the changes made to the building's design. In 1882 or 1883 gives the year as 1882 whereas states 1883. dry rot was found in the high spire. On the recommendation of Rochdale's Borough Surveyor, contractors were engaged to rebuild it. The spire was to be demolished to clear the way for a replacement. It was rumoured that the workmen who were dismantling the top section of the wooden spire may have tried to speed up the dismantling process with matches and, at 9:20 am on 10 April 1883, a blaze was discovered. Despite the efforts of volunteers and the local fire brigade, 100 minutes after the discovery of the fire the entire spire, including a statue of Saint George and the Dragon, had been destroyed. The cause of the fire was never established, but Rochdale's fire service was criticised for taking longer to respond to the blaze than Oldham's (based south), despite the Rochdale Fire Brigade being based in the Town Hall. Alfred Waterhouse was given the task of designing a stone replacement. His work on the clock tower, which was built between 1885 and 1887 about further to the east than the original, shows many similarities to Manchester Town Hall, which he also designed. The tower was opened in 1887; an inscribed plaque commemorates the fire of 1883. On 15 January 1931, at the height of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the Territorial Army was called to guard the Town Hall during a protest against unemployment and hunger.. In May 1938, Rochdale-born actress, singer and comedian Gracie Fields was granted Honorary Freedom of the Borough for her contribution to entertainment. \\"When the ceremony was over, Gracie went onto the town hall balcony to receive the cheers and good wishes of the thousands of people who were packing the streets below.\\". Although it is not fully understood how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912‚Äì13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture so much that it is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German- occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War. Features Location At OS Grid Reference (53.6156¬∞, ‚àí2.1594¬∞), Rochdale Town Hall is the centerpiece of Rochdale, located in Town Hall Square to the south of The Esplanade and the River Roch. The Parish Church of St Chad is situated by the wooded hillside behind the Town Hall.. In Town Hall Square, opposite the Town Hall, is a statue of John Bright, dated 1891, and the Rochdale War Memorial. Bright was a Rochdale-born orator, pacifist and Member of Parliament for Birmingham known for his campaigns to repeal the Corn Laws as well as his opposition to slavery in the United States and the Crimean War. Touchstones Rochdale art gallery and local studies centre is across The Esplanade. Exterior and layout Rochdale Town Hall in 1909 The frontage and principal entrance of the Town Hall face the River Roch, and comprises a portico of three arches intersected by buttresses. Decorating the main entrance are stone crockets, gargoyles, and finials. Four gilded lions above a parapet around three sides of the portico bear shields carrying the coats of arms of Rochdale Council and the hundred of Salford. Rochdale Town Hall is wide, deep, and is faced with millstone grit quarried from Blackstone Edge and Todmorden. Although now blackened by industrial pollution, the building has been described as a \\"rich example of domestic Gothic architecture\\". Naturalistic carved foliage on the exterior recalls the style of Southwell Minster, and the architecture is influenced by Perpendicular Period and medieval town halls of continental Europe. The building has been likened to Manchester Town Hall, Manchester Assize Courts, the Royal Courts of Justice, and St Pancras railway station, all products of the Gothic Revival architectural movement. The stained glass windows, some of which were designed by William Morris, have been described as \\"the finest modern examples of their kind\\". At each end of the frontage is an octagonal staircase. In the words of Nikolaus Pevsner, Rochdale Town Hall has \\"a splendidly craggy exterior of blackened stone\\". The building has a roughly symmetrical E-shaped plan, and is broken down into three self-contained segments: a central Great Hall and transverse wings at each end, which have variously been used as debating chambers, corporation-rooms, trade and a public hall. The south-east wing used to house the magistrates' courts, and the north-west wing the mayor's rooms. In the north-east is a tower. Access to the main entrance is through a central porte cochere. The fa√ßade extends across 14 bays, of which the Great Hall accounts for seven. On both sides, the outermost bays rise to three storeys. They flank asymmetric round-headed arcades‚Äîtwo to the left and three to the right, all of single-storey height‚Äîwhich sit below plain mullioned windows, balconies and ornately decorated gables. The clock tower was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the architect of Manchester Town Hall. Clock tower The present clock tower, which has a stone spire, was built to replace the one destroyed in the 1883 fire. It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a similar style to one of his earlier works, the clock tower of Manchester Town Hall. The first stone was laid by Thomas Schofield JP, Alderman and Rochdale Borough Councillor, on 19 October 1885 and the tower was declared complete on 20 June 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It contains five bells which ring on the hour and at 15-minute intervals. The design of the original tower was more elaborate and higher than its successor, which is tall. The tower rises from a plinth and has four stages including the gable-headed clock stage, which is also decorated with pinnacles. A small stone spire completes the composition. Interior Entrance Hall Etching of the Grand staircase by William Henry Crossland, 1871 Murals in the former council chamber depict the inventions that drove the Industrial Revolution, and the Great Hall is adorned with a large fresco of the signing of Magna Carta by artist Henry Holiday, although the painting is dirty. Responsibility for the decoration of the interior was given to Heaton, Butler and Bayne, who incorporated floor tiles that were manufactured by Mintons and decorated with the local insignia and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.. The stone Grand Staircase, which leads from the vestibule to the Great Hall, is decorated with stained glass; such glass windows decorate most of the Town Hall and are considered to be the finest example of the work of Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The medieval style Great Hall, described by Pevsner as a room of \\"great splendour and simplicity\\", has a hammerbeam roof flanked by statues of angels, in a design that resembles Westminster Hall. Heritage status and function winter of 2009‚Äì2010 The Town Hall was listed at Grade I on 25 October 1951. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". In February 2001, it was one of 39 Grade I listed buildings, and 3,701 listed buildings of all grades, in Greater Manchester. Within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, it is one of only three Grade I listed buildings, and 312 listed buildings of all grades. Although the majority of local government functions take place in Rochdale's Municipal Offices building, Rochdale Town Hall continues to be used for cultural and ceremonial functions. For instance it is used for the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale's mayoralty, civil registry, and for formal naturalisation in British Citizenship ceremonies.

Kashmiri society was organised somewhat differently from other areas of India in which Hinduism flourished, this being due to the influence that Buddhism came to have from the time of the reign of Asoka around the third century BC. The more common social and economic demarcation lines of varna - a ritual ranking system comprising Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra - became blurred, with the exception of that between the Brahmins and all other Hindus. Instead, it was occupation that formed the primary differentiator and of the occupations it was that of agriculture which was most important. As landholders and agriculturalists, the damaras were the most important of the occupational classes and their power could be considerable.

Each summer since 1992, they have sponsored archaeological fieldwork at the ancient Maya site of Blue Creek in northwestern Belize. The Program's goal is, first and foremost, to conduct research that adds to the body of scholarly knowledge and helps to better understand the past of the complex ancient societies of the Americas. Many affiliated scholars are internationally recognized as leaders in their fields. Recent support has come from the National Geographic Society, the National Science Foundation, the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, the Heinz Foundation, and the American Council of Learned Societies. In addition, the Blue Creek field school has been certified by the Registry of Professional Archaeologists.  Current Excavations   Understanding the Classic Collapse  What happened to Classic Maya civilization? Why did the entire society collapse‚Äîregion wide‚Äîduring a short crisis in the mid-ninth century A.D.? Was it persistent warfare? Agricultural or environmental collapse? Overpopulation? Drought? Or some combination . . . of some other factors altogether? Because of the extent of the Blue Creek site (from Middle Preclassic to the Terminal Classic collapse) and because of the length of time and extent of our studies, MRP is in a unique position to analyze a wealth of data that may provide critical insights into this mystery. This is an overarching focus of research over the coming years, into which all of our new projects will feed. This is at the vanguard of scholarship, impacting the debate about the Classic Maya collapse among scholars and institutions around the world.  Nojol Nah  Equally exciting is a newly discovered center of monumental architecture in our survey area. This may represent a suburban center connected to an allied polity of Blue Creek or even an entirely separate city-state. There is much to be learned from this new, major discovery in the context of a well-studied site like Blue Creek, and it will be a focus of MRP's work at the Blue Creek Field Station for years to come. Mapping of the new site by Blue Creek staff and volunteers began in the 2008 excavation season and will continue in 2011.  Chum Balam-Nal  Current efforts at Blue Creek are focused on excavation of the Chum Balam-Nal, and elite residential zone on the Bravo Escarpment, just south of Blue Creek‚Äôs main plaza. This effort began in 2009 and will continue for several years and is revealing a great deal about the relationships among the elites living in the city center and the \\"sub-elites\\" living some distance away. What was going on here as the Classic period drew to a close and Maya civilization began to collapse?  Wetlands Agriculture  Led by Sheryl & Tim Beach, continues long term investigations of ancient wetlands agricultural systems at Blue Creek and elsewhere in northern Belize.  Bedrock  In 2008, a wonderfully preserved, deeply buried Early Classic midden was discovered at the Bedrock site. Excavations of this group will continue in 2011.  The Site of Blue Creek  A map of the ancient Maya ruins of Blue Creek, Belize.  A Middle Preclassic through Terminal Classic Sequence  The earliest deposits discovered so far at Blue Creek come from a complex midden in front of and beneath the Temple of the Masks. During the 1995, 1996 and 1997 seasons, a large portion of the midden was excavated. By the Middle Preclassic period, Blue Creek was apparently a nucleated village engaged in complex communal ritual. No structural remains have yet been found from this period. The ceramics from the period exhibit a close affinity in the Middle Preclassic to those of coastal Belize rather than the Belize Valley. The midden deposits at the Temple of the Masks also include a rich record of Late Preclassic activity. Moreover, it now appears that, by no later than the end of the Late Preclassic, the fundamental form of the Main Plaza was in place. Early phases of Structures 1, 4 and 6 were erected. An early phase of Str. 5 also probably existed (Pastrana 1995). However, it is believed that this building was raised at a later date. While most of these buildings were unimposing at this time, Structure 1 rose 8 meters above the plaza. As at many sites, Cerros for example, this period saw the instatement of a royal lineage at Blue Creek. Overt indications of complex society include the creation of public and sacred space at Blue Creek marked by a major bloodletting cache which dedicates the Late Preclassic version of Structure 4. This cache was placed immediately in front of the basal step of Structure 4 and consisted of seven chert (Colha) bifaces, fragments of jade and coral, two jade earflares, five jade beads, a number of marine shells, 425 obsidian blades and flakes, and 27 obsidian cores. These were all compactly located and a fragment of preserved cloth found underneath them. This cache is the result of a ceremony which included large scale bloodletting and placement of a cotton bag of bloodletting paraphernalia and other offerings in front of the building. This ceremony marked the dedication of Structure 4 and the establishment of central authority at Blue Creek. Once established, the centralized authority at Blue Creek grew rapidly and grew wealthy. Buildings on the Main Plaza were greatly expanded in the Early Classic. Structure 4, for example, was remodeled to an order of magnitude larger than its Late Preclassic counterpart. The final version of Structure 5 was built. This 50 meter long, six meter tall range building defined the west side of the Main Plaza. Structure 6 was converted from a low platform to a small, but significant range building, immediately west of the towering Structure 1.  Structure 1  The special nature of Structure 1 is clear not only from its Early Classic expansion, but from the nature of its superstructure. On top of this tall temple was not a typical southern lowlands temple, but an open colonnaded building (Driver 1995, 1996). The facade consisted of 16 round, masonry and marl columns and each end was open. The only similar structure in the region which may date from this period is Structure V at Kohunlich (Andrews 1987), but even this is uncertain. The existence of these structures indicates that the origin of columned buildings may be a southern lowlands innovation which was incorporated into later northern lowlands architecture, rather than an indicator of Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic interaction, as some have argued.  Structures 2 & 3  These two buildings define the east side of the Main Plaza at Blue Creek. They are virtually identical and were placed on a north-south line. It is believed that this is a regional variant of a E-Group Complex which is an astronomical observatory named after Group E at Uaxactun. From a point near the middle of the plaza, an observer would see the sun rise over the top of Structure 2 on the morning of the Summer Solstice and over the top of Structure 3 on the morning of the Winter Solstice. Of course, at the Spring and Fall Equinox, the sun would rise exactly at the midpoint between the two buildings. There are no accurate construction dates for these buildings, but they were probably built during the Early Classic period.  Structure 4  = The Ritual Event = At about AD 500, a major ritual act occurred at Structure 4 on the south end of the Main Plaza. Not only does this event underscore the wealth of Blue Creek, but it marked a turning point in the history of the community. Much of the data regarding this deposit comes from the work of Pamela Weiss, who excavated the material (Guderjan and Weiss 1995; Weiss 1995) In preparation for the ritual, a large part of the center of the penultimate stage of Structure 4 was removed to accommodate the construction of a masonry lined shaft, where later the sacrificial deposits would be made. Since the construction fill of Structure 4 is composed of loosely laid, large boulders, a large excavation was necessary to safely construct the shaft. This preparatory excavation was dug immediately outside of the superstructural building of Structure 4-2nd and reached a depth of 4.3 meters with a north- south dimension of 4.6 meters. On the eastern side a retaining wall was built to secure the excavation from wall collapse. The western limit of the prehistoric excavation is still being investigated. After the initial excavation, the shaft was constructed, probably a few courses at a time, and the excavation refilled around the shaft. The shaft was stone lined, with a diameter of approximately 50 cm. and a depth of more than 3 meters. During the refilling around the shaft, numerous caches of pottery vessels were placed around the shaft. In total, more than 100 vessels were cached. Nearly all of them were of the type called \\"Blue Creek Orange\\". Blue Creek Orange is similar to but yet distinctive from types such as Garbut Creek Red. The caches were placed both in nested arrangements of three inverted vessels or laid down as rim-to-rim caches. All of the caches from this area were surrounded with small irregular disks of burned limestone, often called \\"hamburger stones\\". These are largely associated with Late Preclassic Termination Rituals at Cerros (Garber 1989:34). In addition to the pottery, fractured and complete jade beads, a stingray spine, and a bird leg bone was recovered from these caches (Guderjan and Weiss 1995). The majority of the pottery vessels are low, outflaring-sided vessels with a matte orange slipped surface (Aquilla Orange). Some darkening occurring from firing is evident. Also, a blotchy post-fire darkening is apparent on some of the vessels. It appears that artifacts were placed in the bottom of the vessels. The vessels placed in, rather than around, the shaft were covered with incense which was burnt long enough to darken the vessels before their deposition. Also, several cylindrical censers were recovered which are similar to those later placed in the shaft. The ritual which occurred after the shaft was constructed included a complex placement of individual caches. However, the ritual seems to have occurred over a short period of time, probably during a single day. This is evidenced by sherds from partially reconstructable vessels scattered throughout the fill of the shaft. Three distinct deposits were sequentially placed in the shaft during the event. The lower portion of the shaft contained the bulk of the artifacts in caches 9A, 9B, 9C, 10 and 11. Included in this area were worked jades, ceramics, shells, a chert eccentric, and human finger bone. The second segment was separated from the first by a marl \\"cap\\" and contained ceramic sherds from a number of partially reconstructable vessels. The upper segment of the shaft contained only burnt organic material. The first cache placed in the lowest portion of the shaft was Cache 12. This consisted of a large, cruciform, chert eccentric (Figure 4) and a small, unslipped, pinch pot. The chert eccentric was oriented to the cardinal directions and its north and south tips were broken off. The chert eccentric normally could be considered to be a symbol of creation and the world tree. However, its broken tips may negate its life-giving aspect (Weiss 1995). The complexity and planning involved in the entire process is seen in the placement of two other caches immediately outside of the shaft at this level. Each consisted of two vessels (Blue Creek Orange) placed rim-to-rim. Cache 13, containing an offering of mollusks, was placed on the north side, and Cache 14, containing a food residue, was placed on the south side of the shaft, so that the broken tips of the eccentric were pointing to these caches. About a meter above Cache 12 within the shaft was Cache 11, which held multiple vessels of Blue Creek Orange. While the number of vessels has not been determined, the minimum number of vessels is 21. Cache 10 was another rim-to-rim placement containing 46 shells of 3 freshwater and terrestrial species. It was placed only a few centimeters above Cache 11. About a meter above Cache 10, the shaft fill was capped with marl. The shaft fill in this area included diverse ceramic sherds and partially burnt wood and the remains of what was probably burning incense. While no intact vessels are present, multiple sherds from a number of vessels were recovered. Cache 9B, placed on top of this marl surface, was the most dramatic of the individual caches found. It consisted of a rim-to-rim placement of two pottery vessels containing 356 artifacts, mostly jade beads (Figure 5). Cache 9C was another rim-to-rim placement containing four artifacts: a 10 x 4 cm, anthropomorphic, tubular bead, an anthropomorphic head pendant with an extended tongue and two other beads (Figure 6). This was placed directly south of Cache 9B on the same marl surface. The climax of the ritual event was to cap the entire deposit with the massive limestone bannerstone, 74 centimeters in diameter with a central opening fashioned by grinding and exhibiting polish from use, and an uncarved stela, 1.48 meters in length, that laid prone over the northern portion of the bannerstone. The smoke of the burning incense wafted out of the deposit and around the prone stela (Figure 7). The ritual event was ended by the snuffing of the incense when additional construction material was used to bury the shaft opening. = Dating the Event = The dating of this ritual event is based upon ceramic comparative analysis, two radiocarbon samples from within the shaft and two radiocarbon samples from the area around the shaft which was excavated to accommodate the shaft and then refilled. Dos Arroyos Orange-Polychromes associated with the shaft and other Manik ceramic complex (Tikal) material fix a date of approximately AD 250-550. In addition, a few Teotihuacan sherds were found in the shaft. Radiocarbon dates from within the shaft were selected from quite different elevations. One was retrieved from the uppermost carbonized organic deposit and was separated from the rest of the ritual by a marl cap. The other sample came from the lowest level of the shaft. The corrected dates are 10 years from one another: 1440 +/- 110 BP (Beta-75432) and 1450 +/- 100 BP (Beta-76278). When the samples were cleaned in preparation for analysis, a large amount of wood was extracted from the completely organic sample indicating that the fire had been quickly extinguished. The radiocarbon dates from caches in the fill around the shaft generally corroborate this date. One corrected date from Cache 21 was 1870 +/- 50 (Beta-82949) and a corrected AMS date from Cache 14 was 1950 +/- 50. These Late Preclassic dates are clearly much too early, as the building itself is definitively Early Classic in style with supporting ceramic evidence. However, the dated material could have come from recycled fill from the earlier version of Str. 4. Consequently, the information has been interpreted to indicate that the ritual filling of the shaft occurred about 1450 BP (500 AD). However, it is possible that the shaft was in place somewhat earlier. One piece of information which makes this dubious is the relative placement of Caches 12, 13, and 14. The chert eccentric in Cache 12 was clearly placed with full knowledge of the precise location (outside of tmjmhe shaft) of Caches 13 and 14. It seems unlikely that their locations could be that precisely known if such a substantial period of time had elapsed since their placement.  Structure 5  This is a long \\"Range Building\\" which was excavated by Dale Pastrana in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The top or superstructure of the building consists of a single, 75-meter-long, vaulted (stone-roofed) room with 7 doors and open ends. This room is accessed via a 13-step central staircase. Built in the Early Classic period, Pastrana argues that it functioned as a viewing gallery for events in the Main Plaza.  Structure 6  It was originally believed that this small Range Building was a late addition to the Main Plaza architecture. However, excavations by Dale Pastrana in 1995 showed that this was originally built during the Late Preclassic period with much of the other architecture at the site. A carved stela stood in front of Structure 6 until the 1970s when looting occurred at the site.  Structure 7 - Ballcourt  The Ballcourt was built at the same time as the very large platform underneath it. However, it is not yet known when this occurred. The presence of a ballcourt at Blue Creek may reflect the community's status as an independent polity. The rest of the Ballcourt Platform may have been used for specialized craft activities in support of the royalty.  Structure 9  At the southern end of Area B is the Temple of the Masks (Structure 9), another dramatic statement as to the nature of Blue Creek in the Early Classic period (Haines 1995). The earliest phase of the building (Str. 9-I) dates to the Late Preclassic and is built on top of Middle and Late Preclassic midden deposits. However, by the mid-Early Classic, architecture of the temple is typical of Petan temples, with a single room superstructure on top of a steeply inclined substructure. Access to the superstructure was gained by a broad central staircase. Unlike most such buildings in the Peten, though, the Temple of the Masks has a large staircase outset, near the top of the stairs. Similar outsets are seen are Altun Ha (Pendergast 1979, 1982) and Kakabish (Guderjan 1996). The facade of the outset is adorned with a complex five paneled, deep relief stucco frieze which included at least two and probably three anthropomorphic masks. Two of these are in excellent condition but the left face has been destroyed. Despite their Early Classic style, these were originally dated these to the Late Classic based on confusing ceramics from an associated cache and argued that this was an archaizing trait (Grube, et al. 1995). However, after the 1995 season, it was recognized that this was not correct and that these masks actually date to the Early Classic period. Both faces have chin straps or bib motifs. The center image has closed eyes, hollowed cheeks, a slack jaw and a protruding tongue. The face is wearing an elaborate head-dress decorated with volutes shaped like an Ahaw glyph. The volutes represent smoke or foliation and may be the Early Classic form of the phonetic symbol ya (Thompson's T126) Grube (1990) has shown the Ahaw sign, when not used as a day sign, is a logogram for the word nik or \\"flower\\". This was interpreted as marking the building as a nikteil na or \\"flower house\\" (Grube, et al. 1995). These are specific houses for dancing and counsels (Freidel, et al. 1993: 257-263) and may have also served as accession houses for rulers. Another element of the stucco facade supports this interpretation as well. A single glyph is located above the recessed panel between the two masks. This is interpreted as representing a sky or earth band with the phonetic value ki, meaning \\"heart\\" or \\"center\\" (Grube, et al. 1995). This glyph may represent the axis mundi (Grube et al. 1995), which Freidel (1992:127) associates with Ahaw (kingship) and political authority. The presence of a nikteil na at Blue Creek is strong evidence that the community was ruled by an independent, local royal lineage. This is distinctly contrary to Adams' interpretation that the region was subsumed under a macro-state based at Tikal at the time (Adams 1995). Instead, Blue Creek and probably other medium-sized sites are fundamentally independent and self-governing. At Blue Creek, it would appear that an independent royal lineage was established in the latter part of the Late Preclassic Period which then flourished economically and politically in the Early Classic period. However, all of this came to an abrupt end sometime during the first half of the sixth century.  Structure 13  Dramatically reflecting the changes which occurred in the Late Classic is the Str. 13 Courtyard (Gilgan 1996). In the Early Classic, this courtyard was a small plaza consisting of Structures 10, 12 and 13. Normally, such sacred space could not be converted to other uses by the same population. Nevertheless, the addition of Structures 11 and 14 did exactly that in the Late Classic. Structure 14 was a large vaulted, single room and Structure 11 was partially vaulted and partially a ramada-type room. The construction of these structures violated the normal rules of sacredness of plaza space by enclosing part of the plaza and secularizing it into elite residential space. This act underscores the transition of Blue Creek from a regional power to what was probably an outpost of another kingdom.  Structure 15  Structure 15 is a low set of vaulted rooms. Excavations by Bob Baker and David Bianco show that building was constructed in the Late Classic Period and that the back wall of the building fell off the steep platform edge. This building may have been constructed when the Str. 13 Courtyard was converted from sacred, open space to a secular, elite residence.  Structure 19 Courtyard.  The Str. 19 Courtyard is a Yucatecan style, patio-quad residence. Built in the Early Classic period, the courtyard underwent repeated remodellings for several hundred years. Excavations by Bob Lichtenstein have shown that the residents buried at least six individuals ate different times in a bench in a small east side room of the complex. It is not known who these individuals were. However, this was, arguably, the residence of the king of Blue Creek. So, these may be family members.  Structure 24, The Temple of the Obsidian Warrior.  We have done almost no work at this building. However, in the 1970s, the building was very badly looted. Mary Neivens was working at another site at the time and came to visit Blue Creek. She documented several hundred flakes of obsidian, probably associated with a tomb which was destroyed by looters.

The village starts as soon as Uktad (last delimited ward in Chiplun town) ends. The first landmark of Mirjoli seen is Kabrastan on left side of the road which houses a dargah of revered saint Mira Hussain. An annual Urs is held here every year. As we move forward, we come across first human habitation with houses mainly perched on left side of the road on the mountain. There are some houses which have now been built along the road side too, but, mainly most of the houses are located on the slope of the mountain. This area is known as Sakharwadi. Although dominated by locals (Dalwais) previously, this area has now grown to be a true \\"cosmopolitan\\" area of Mirjoli and houses people from all religions and castes now. Sakharwadi has a beautifully built Mosque as its major landmark. It also has a Kabrastan belonging to Buddhists. As we move forward and enter the main village area of Mirjoli, we see a small but nevertheless frequented Sai Mandir. Image of newly built and ever growing huge building of National English Medium School looms large in the background. Its one of the major contribution of Dalwais among many, that this community has given to Chiplun Taluka. A small shady country road (ridden with potholes and ignored for repairs for a long time now) emerges at this junction. This small road meanders to the left side away from the main Guhagar road towards ethnically divided localities (Wadis in Marathi/Kokani) of Mirjoli village, finally culminating at the historic and much revelry followed Mahalaxmi Temple. As we move a little forward on this small internal road, we come to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar chowk. This chowk is a significant landmark in the village due to its location. On its right is the newly built National English Medium School (Formerly, Dalwai Highschool), and on the left is Marathi Primary School. Both these schools, have in the past, seen glory in their heyday, as almost all of the villagers received their education here. This trend has now dwindled as the erstwhile Dalwai Highschool shifted from here to the new campus in Paanval area, many new English medium schools emerging in Chiplun, due to which parents opted for them to induct their children, shabby management of Marathi primary school and last but not the least, coming up of National English Medium School in the same place where Dalwai Highschool, once stood. As we move forward on this road, we pass through Boudhhawadis. Boudhhawadis because, there are two of them. One is called Boudhhawadi-1 and the other Boudhhawadi-2. As mentioned earlier, these are ethnically divided localities. Boudhhwadi consists of only Buddhist people. Boudhhawadi-1 boasts of a Boudhha Temple on left of the road on mountain slope, overlooking much of the Mirjoli village. Further on this road is Pawarwadi (also called Marathwadi). As the name suggests, only people belonging to Maratha caste live here. Pawarwadi is the last of human habituated areas of the village on this road. This road further meanders over the mountain to \\"Maal Raan\\" area of village, where the historic Mahalaxmi Temple is located. A village fair is organized here every year besides the temple, which is frequented by people of different villages. A major attraction of this fair is the coveted \\"Bull Cart Race\\". This event is widely followed around Chiplun and attracts a major crowd every year. Other localities (or wadis) in the village which are situated in the mountain and are inaccessible by road largely include Nhaviwadi, inhabited by only people belonging to Barber's profession, Kunbiwadi inhabited by people belonging to Kunbi caste and Brahminwadi with people belonging to Brahmin caste. Brahmins have always been intellectually strong community, though very few remain in the village now. Most of them have settled in Pune and Mumbai areas. Although Nhaviwadi has a small population, Kunbiwadi has a relatively larger population of 600 -750 people. Both these localities are located on the mountain, above Muslim Mohalla which is located further on the main Guhagar road. As we move further from ambedkar chowk. This, by far, is the most prosperous area of Mirjoli village dotted by beautifully constructed bungalows on both sides of the main Guhagar road, as well as other exquisitely built houses. This locality belongs to Muslims (almost all of them being Dalwais). Mohalla has an important Maulana Azad chowk at the centre of the mohalla, where Tri-colour is unfurled twice a year on 15 August and 26 January. Many imminent personalities have graced Maharashtra's political and social circle from the Dalwai community. Namely Samir Hasan Dalwai, Hamid Umar Dalwai, AbuBakkar (Abuseth) Dalwai, HasanKhan Mohammed Khan Dalwai, Hussain Umar Dalwai (Minister in Govt of Maharashtra, MP Rajya sabha), Hussain Dalwai (MP RajyaSabha) and many others. Financially speaking, Muslims (Dalwais) are most stable of all other communities residing in Mirjoli. Many of the youngsters belonging to this community, work in abroad in gulf countries. Many other families (also from other communities of the village) are settled in Mumbai, Nasik and Pune. As we move further on the main Guhagar road, area located is Paanval. Newly located Dalwai Highschool is situated here. This area consists of largely immigrant population from other villages settled here. This is the last frontier of Mirjoli village. The village of Kondhe-Shiral starts after this. Major land holdings in Mirjoli are still used for farming. As we move towards Guhagar on the main road, the landscape that mainly attracts us is that most houses are located on the left side of the road and the right side of the road is almost entirely fields used for farming. These fields stretch out till the village's border with Gowalkot area of Chiplun Municipal Council. A tributary river of Vashishthi river flows through these fields, which accounts for water requirement to farming as well as daily consumption for people in the village. The river flowing besides the village makes Mirjoli village a perfect idealistic village situated in the nature's lap.

She composes with a machine to create electronic loops built around her vocalizing. She self-released her debut EP, Sanguine, in 2006. The songs are wordless with vocal overdubs, vocal percussion, and improvisation. On the EP Florine, she uses a loop station and pedals to create minimalist repetition accompanied by layers of vocals and synthesizers. In 2010, Barwick was commissioned to remix \\"Reckoner\\" by Radiohead. During the next year, she released an album of improvisational music with Ikue Mori. She recorded her first full-length album The Magic Place on a rehearsal stage because it was sound proof and because it had a piano. The title of the album refers to a tree on her family's farm that was big enough to crawl into, as though the tree contained rooms shaped by the trunk and branches. In 2012, she formed the duo Ombre with Helado Negro and recorded the album Believe You Me. The title of her second album, Nepenthe, was inspired by the death of a relative.

Since 1983,\\"The Standby Program,\\" by Jason Guerrasio, The Independent, November 2003. Standby has provided editorial services to independent film and video producers on a wide range of projects, including documentaries, video art, installations, sound mixes, film-to-tape transfers and video preservation. History Alex Roshuk and Rick Feist, film students at Princeton University, started the program at Matrix, a large video studio on Eleventh Avenue and West 52nd Street. Feist began working there as a tape operator and suggested to the owners that they offer online editing to artists on the weekends and late at night at reduced rates on a standby basis (hence the name). Matrix had three large video studios with blue screen, three online video suites, a tape library and production office space. (Today it is home to Comedy Central's The Daily Show.) Roshuk's 185 Corporation became the non-profit umbrella for Standby. The program became a model in the 1980s for the way artists could interface with corporations for effective use of technical and financial resources. Artists' using Standby paid upfront, which benefited two-fold. Such an arrangement ensured Matrix that they would be paid on time and that all the projects edited were vetted as bonafide, independent productions. Juan Downey's Information Withheld was the first artist project to be edited at Standby. Downey began a long relationship with Feist and edited all his tapes from The Thinking Eye project there, as well as one of the first interactive art videos, BachDisk. In less than a year, demand for the program began to outpace its resources. It attracted interest from other artists, including Dara Birnbaum, Nam June Paik, Mary Lucier, Gary Hill, Gretchen Bender, Edin Velez, and Jem Cohen, among others. Standby rapidly grew, adding new editors, tape operators, and administrators. Matrix donated the second floor of the tape library to house all the artists' master tapes. Standby started to receive funding as a media arts center from the New York State Council for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the Andy Warhol Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. By the end of the 1980s, the staff of the Standby program included Tom Crawford, Joe DePierro, Rick Feist, Nora Fisch, Eleanor Goldsmith, Lisa Guido, Steve Guiliano, and Kathy High. The Raindance Foundation served as its umbrella organization. With the closing of Matrix in 1990, Standby relocated to a number of other post-production facilities, primarily working out of Editel NY, until that facility closed in 1995. Maria Venuto became executive director that same year, and integrated the operation of Media Alliance's Online Program, a similar post-production service that also started in 1983 with Standby's help. Under the leadership of Executive Director Maria Venuto, Standby's services have expanded to include a magnetic media preservation program.\\"Maria Venuto, Executive Director, The Standby Program,\\"NAMAC Newsletter, May 2011.

He was the President of the Chamber of Advisors from 16 August 2005 until 25 January 2011.  Biography  Coming from a modest family of five (his father is a farmer and his stay-at-home mom), he joined the first class of the National School of Administration (ENA) after a master's degree in economics from the Faculty of Law and Economics of Tunis. During the presidency of Habib Bourguiba, he was successively attached cabinet to the Ministry of the Interior and Equipment (1972), chief of staff of Defense Ministers Abdallah Farhat and Rachid Sfar. Terminated in 1980, he taught for thirteen months at ENA then became CEO of a company specializing in building. On 11 April 1988, he became Minister of Defense before replacing General Abdelhamid Escheikh at the head of the Ministry of the Interior from 17 February 1991 to 24 January 1995, in a context of struggle against Islamism. Became an adviser to President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, he found the Ministry of Defense from June 13, 1996 to January 22, 1997, moved to the Ministry of Justice in 1997-1999 before becoming Minister of the Interior for the second time November 17, 1999. On January 23, 2001, following the filing of a complaint of torture against him, President Ben Ali decided to temporarily remove him from politics. Three years later, he was appointed in January 2004 as President of the Economic and Social Council. After the creation of the House of Councilors and its installation, he was elected on August 16. Treasurer of the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD) from 1988, he is a member of his political bureau and its central committee [1] until his removal from the party on January 18, 2011. On February 14, 2001, he was at the Cantonal Hospital of Geneva where he underwent a triple coronary bypass after having a discomfort. While Hatem Ben Salem is seen by an employee of the hospital, he calls Abdennacer Nait-Liman, a Tunisian political refugee living in Geneva since 1995 and president of an association of victims of torture in Tunisia. He informed √âric Sottas, director of the World Organization against Torture in Geneva, and lawyer Fran√ßois Fran√ßoisz, and lodged a complaint against Kallel for \\"grievous bodily harm, kidnapping, insults, endangering the health, constraints and abuse of authority \\"; Na√Øt-Liman was indeed tortured in the premises of the Ministry of the Interior between April 22 and June 1, 1992. If he had testified eight months earlier in the book Torture in Tunisia. 1987‚Äì2000. Plea for abolition and against impunity, the name of Kallel was not mentioned. The complaint is dismissed in February 2001 and then appealed on May 22, 2007. This initiative is a first for the Swiss prosecutor's office but Kallel leaves the territory in time thanks to the diplomatic passport that confers on him his rank of minister. Sottas accuses him of being \\"responsible for the torture of thousands of people\\". On January 23, 2011, after the revolution, he was placed under house arrest [5] before resigning from the presidency of the House of Councilors two days later. He was arrested on 12 March, following a complaint filed by a group of 24 lawyers for a charge of embezzlement within the RCD. On the 14th of March his property is seized by decree; he is then interrogated on May 14, concluded by a warrant of committal. On 21 May, the State Litigation Officer lodged an urgent complaint for the freezing of the assets of Kallel's properties; his property is sequestrated three days later. Abdallah Kallel is hospitalized on July 22 at the military hospital of Tunis, in a state considered quite serious by his family, following a cardiac malaise; this one points out its conditions of detention to explain the deterioration of its state of health. On 29 November, the Criminal Chamber of the Tunisian Permanent Military Court of First Instance sentences him to four years in prison in the case of Barraket Essahel [13], reduced to two years in prison on appeal on 7 April 2012. On July 10, 2013, he is released at the end of his sentence.

His contributions include studies on the Agaricales (gilled mushrooms), especially the genus Russula, about which he wrote a monograph in 1933. Later, he revised the genus in the series Die Pilze Mitteleuropas (1926‚Äì1967); his notes were published posthumously by his wife Liesel in 1952 with the help of other mycologists. The work was considered the \\"authoritative treatment of the group for Central Europe\\". One of the Russula species that was first described in this publication was R. laeta. Sch√§ffer developed a chemical test to help with the identification of Agaricus species. A positive reaction of Schaeffer's test, which uses the reaction of aniline and nitric acid on the surface of the mushroom, is indicated by an orange to red color; it is characteristic of species in the section Flavescentes. The compounds responsible for the reaction were named schaefferal A and B to honor Sch√§ffer. Sch√§ffer is the only mycologist of modern times known to have died from consuming poisonous mushrooms, in this case, Paxillus involutus. About an hour after he and his wife ate a meal prepared with the mushrooms, Sch√§ffer developed vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. His condition worsened to the point where he was admitted to hospital the following day, and subsequently developed renal failure, perishing after 17 days.

It covers an area of 315.83 km¬≤ with a population of 11,360 people (2010). The capital lies at Laguardia. It is part of a notable wine growing region. Its northern boundary is formed by the Sierra de Cantabria and Sierra de Tolo√±o, two mountain ranges that separate it from the rest of √Ålava. To the south, its geographical limit is marked by the Ebro River, its border with the neighboring autonomous community of La Rioja. A view of vineyards in Rioja Alavesa Covered in winter snow The Sonsierra of La Rioja includes the municipalities of √Åbalos and San Vicente de la Sonsierra, located north of the Ebro River. Although geographically part of the river's left bank, these municipalities form a wedge of land technically belonging to the autonomous community of La Rioja. It thus divides the Rioja Alavesa in two: Labastida, located to the west, and the remaining Rioja Alavesa municipalities to the east, with Laguardia and Oion at its main towns. The border with Navarre to the east are not based on clearly defined geographical features like the aforementioned boundaries. The rivers within the area are all tributaries of the Ebro. There are some dolmens and other archaeological remnants of the prehistoric La Hoya people. The Romans established themselves in the area due to its climate and mountainous landscape. During the Middle Ages, this region belonged to the Kingdom of Navarre, the Sonsierra, which was eventually occupied and annexed to the Crown of Castile in 1463 as a result of Castile's intervention in the Kingdom of Navarre. The region possesses 11,500 hectares of vineyards - the local economy being based primarily on viticulture and the production of La Rioja wine. La Rioja DOCa (Denominaci√≥n de Origen Calificada, akin to AVA in US wine-growing regions) is separated into three subregions, of which La Rioja Alavesa is one.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development After Haufe's earlier Buzzer was deemed less than successful, due to the insufficiently reliable Nelson Aircraft engine, Haufe retired that design and designed a new aircraft, which became the Buzzer 2. Intended to be a cross between a conventional sailplane and a light aircraft the aircraft was built with a wing span and has a 16:1 glide ratio. The Buzzer 2 is constructed with a welded steel tube fuselage and a wooden wing, all covered with doped aircraft fabric covering. The relatively low 8:1 aspect ratio wing uses a single spar and is supported by a single lift strut. The wing employs a modified NACA 2412 airfoil. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel and two wing-mounted outrigger wheels that support the wing during taxiing. The engine is a Curtiss snowmobile engine that turns at a maximum rpm of 6000, powering the propeller through an oil- immersed 2:1 chain reduction drive, giving a propeller speed of 3000 rpm. Only one Buzzer 2 was constructed. Operational history Haufe reported that the aircraft uses to take-off and climbs at about 500 feet per minute (2.5 m/s). The aircraft was still on the US Federal Aviation Administration registry in July 2011, registered in the Experimental - Amateur-built category.

She has conducted extensive research on early detection, brain development, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and collaborated on studies of genetic risk factors in autism. Dawson is William Cleland Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, Director, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences and Director of the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development at Duke University Medical Center. Dawson is Past-President of the International Society for Autism Research, a scientific and professional organization devoted to advancing knowledge about autism spectrum disorders. From 2008‚Äì2013, Dawson was Research Professor of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was Chief Science Officer for Autism Speaks. Dawson also held the position of Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University and is Professor Emerita of Psychology at University of Washington. She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Society, American Psychological Association, and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. Education Dawson received her Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from the University of Washington in 1974 and her Ph.D. in developmental psychology and child clinical psychology from the University of Washington in 1979. In 1980, she was a postdoctoral fellow and clinical intern at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, where she specialized in neurodevelopmental disorders. She became a licensed practicing child clinical psychologist in 1980. Career Dawson has had a career as a scientist and practicing clinical psychologist focusing on autism spectrum disorders and child psychopathology. She has published extensively in peer-reviewed scientific journals on autism and the effects of early experience on the developing brain. Dawson is currently William Cleland Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry, Director of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, and Founding Director of the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development. Early in her career, Dawson was an assistant professor of child clinical psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and affiliate of the TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-handicapped Children) program from 1980‚Äì1985. In 1985, she returned to her alma mater to join the psychology department faculty, where she directed the University of Washington Child Clinical Psychology Program (1985‚Äì1991; 1999‚Äì2004). From 1996‚Äì2008, Dawson was Founding Director of the University of Washington Autism Center, which worked with Microsoft Corporation to set a precedent for companies to provide insurance coverage for autism early intervention. At the UW Autism Center, she was director of three NIH Autism Center of Excellence Awards, which provided funding for a multimillion-dollar multi-disciplinary autism research program focusing on genetics, neuroimaging, early diagnosis, and treatment. Dawson also founded and oversaw an endowed treatment center for autistic children and adolescents at the UW Autism Center, which provided multi-disciplinary diagnostic and treatment services for autistic children from infancy through late adolescence. Dawson has served as Associate Editor or Editorial Board Member for seven scientific journals: Clinical Psychological Science, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, Development and Psychopathology, Psychophysiology, Autism Research, Autism Research and Treatment, and the Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Dawson's research has focused on early detection and intervention, brain dysfunction (using electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging), and genetic studies. Her key scientific discoveries include demonstrating that maternal depression can influence early brain activity and stress responses of infants and children, the detection of autism symptoms in infants, empirical validation of autistic regression, and elucidation of the nature of early brain dysfunction in autism. Dawson pioneered the use of home videotapes to study early symptoms of autism and the use of electrophysiological techniques to study brain function in very young children with autism. Dawson's lab at the University of Washington discovered differences in brain circuitry related to face processing in autism, apparent even before symptom onset, and defined a lifelong brain characteristic (delayed N170 face-sensitive ERP) that was accepted in the FDA's Biomarker Qualification Program. In collaboration with Dr. Sally J. Rogers, Dawson developed and empirically validated the Early Start Denver Model, the first comprehensive early intervention program for very young children with autism. Autism Speaks Dawson received continuous NIH funding for her research from 1980‚Äì2008 when she left her tenured faculty position at the University of Washington to become Autism Speaks' first chief science officer. At Autism Speaks, Dawson oversaw $20‚Äì30 million in annual research funding, including funding for the Autism Treatment Network, the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, the Autism Genome Project, and the Autism Tissue Program. Under her leadership at Autism Speaks, several new initiatives were launched, including the Translational Medicine Research Initiative, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, the Trailblazer Award, the Autism 10K Genome Project, the Early Access to Care Initiative, the Global Autism Public Health Initiative, and DELSIA (Delivering Scientific Innovation for Autism), a not-for-profit affiliate of Autism Speaks focused on accelerating scientific breakthroughs through partnerships with industry. In 2008, Dawson was featured in the journal, Science, when she began her new role at Autism Speaks. Media and popular press coverage Dawson's work has been featured frequently in the media, including programs such as the Jim Lehrer Newshour, PBS Scientific American Frontiers with Alan Alda, The New York Times, among many others. Her research demonstrating that early intervention can normalize brain activity in children with autism was recognized by TIME magazine as one of the top 10 medical breakthroughs of 2012. The Early Start Denver Model is described in the January 2014 issue of Scientific American Mind. Dawson's scientific research was recognized by the National Institutes of Health as a Top Advance in Autism Research in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The cross was inscribed with the following Basque passage: The cross avoided any significant damage for 50 years and was largely unscathed by the Spanish Civil War and the Spanish Republic, though sometime between the raising of the cross and 1937 the inscription was damaged.

Biography Born in 1612, little is known about Hingston's early life. A pupil of Orlando Gibbons, Hingston became a composer and viol player. Hingston first served Charles I as a viol player and as a member of the court band. Hingston was also teacher for the composer and organist John Blow. When Cromwell assumed power, he appointed Hingston as him court organist and keeper of instruments. He transported a Dallam organ from Magdalen College, Oxford, to his court so that Hingston could play it for him. Hingston also tutored Cromwell's daughters in music. After the Restoration in 1660, Charles II kept Hingston at the royal court. He continued to play viol for the king, and also served as an organ-builder, tuner and keeper of wind instruments. In 1673 Henry Purcell, then a young chorister, was assigned as Hingston's apprentice after his voice broke. The royal warrant read \\"...to swear and admit Henry Purcell in the place of keeper, mender, maker, repairer and tuner of the regals, organs, virginals, flutes and recorders and all other kind of wind instruments whatsoever, in ordinary, without fee, to his Majesty, and assistant to John Hingston, and upon the death or other avoidance of the latter, to come into ordinary with fee.\\" Hingston continued working for Charles II until his death in 1683. Contemporary accounts Roger L'Estrange, in his ‚Äò'Truth and Loyalty vindicated,‚Äô' 1662, writes: ‚ÄòBeing in St. James's Park I heard an organ touched in a little low room of one Mr. Hinkson's; I went in and found a private company of five or six persons; they desired me to take up a viol and bear a part. I did so. ‚Ä¶ By and by, without the least colour of a design, or expectation, in comes Cromwell. He found us playing, and, as I remember, so he left us.‚Äô Hingston is mentioned in the diary of Samuel Pepys.The Diary of Samuel Pepys References Other sources * Campbell, Margaret.

The first attack was a bomb exploding in Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter of Oslo, and the second an attack on a youth camp organized by the youth organization (AUF) of the Norwegian Labour Party (AP) on the island of Ut√∏ya in Tyrifjorden, Viken. The following is a timeline of the attacks, their background and aftermath. All times are in Norwegian Time (CEST or UTC+02).  Background  1999 Anders Behring Breivik is initially inspired to his actions by the Kosovo War and the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and Norway's involvement in this. Breivik saw the war as an attack on Serbia's attempt \\"to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to Albania.\\" 2002 Breivik claims to have taken part in the founding meeting, in London, of the international organisation \\"Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici\\", a resurrection of the medieval Knights Templar. It is unclear if this organisation exists, or is a figment of Breivik's imagination. 2006 To save money for financing the attack, Breivik terminates the lease on his apartment and moves in with his mother, all the while keeping his plans a secret to everybody. 2009 Breivik establishes the company Geofarms, supposedly to farm vegetables and root crops. 2010 Breivik visits Prague in an attempt to buy illegal weapons. The attempt is a failure, and Breivik decides to obtain weapons through legal channels instead. 2011 April: *Breivik rents a farm in √Östa in Innlandet, ostensibly to perform farming. *He tries to buy a significant amount of fertiliser at a store in Oslo, but fails to find the correct type.

Allwyn Refrigerators and Allwyn Watches were once a leading brand in India during the 1970s and 1980s. The company was closed in 1995 due to heavy losses in the company, primarily due to mismanagement. Early History and Products Advertisement for Allwyn Refrigerators (The Hyderabad Allwyn Metal Works Limited) Hyderabad Allwyn Limited was established in January 1942 as Allwyn Metal Works. It was started as joint venture of Industrial Development Trust of the Nizam's Hyderabad Government and M/s Alladin & Company. Hyderabad Allwyn Metal Works Limited used to assemble Albion CX9 buses for Hyderabad State Railways,http://www.albioncx19project.org.uk/other_cx19s.htm and made the ballot boxes for the first general elections in 1952. In 1969 due to inability of its management to run the company efficiently, it was taken over by the state government. Coach Building division The first double-decker buses in Hyderabad were introduced in April 1963. These buses were designed by Hyderabad Allwyn Limited with APSRTC . Eventually the Coach building division became one of the largest coach building contractors for the Andhra Pradesh government's state operated APSRTC buses. Allwyn also built the Indian Army's medium-capacity Shaktiman truck bodies which were originally designed by MAN, Germany as the 415 L1 AR truck. Double decker buses were running in Hyderabad long before the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh in 1956. So the above statement that double decker buses were introduced in Hyderabad is not correct. Refrigeration and Appliance division The Allwyn refrigerators were one of the most popular brands in India. Its rivals were Godrej, Kelvinator and Voltas. Even until 2005 the refrigerators were widely rated for their energy efficiency.  Under Andhra Pradesh State Government  Tie-in with Nissan In 1983 the automobile division entered into a tie-up with Nissan Motor Company, Japan to manufacture the Nissan Cabstar range of Light commercial trucks. The plant was set up at Zahirabad near Hyderabad and this division was named as Hyderabad Allwyn Nissan Ltd with Nissan holding 15% of the equity. A Nissan Cabstar model that was manufactured and sold in India by Allywn, as Allwyn Nissan and currently by Mahindra & Mahindra as Mahindra Loadking Watch Division Hyderabad Allwyn entered the watch business in 1981 in collaboration with Seiko of Japan to manufacture mechanical and Quartz watches. Until then the central Government-run HMT had been the market leader for wrist watches in India. Allwyn along with HMT and Titan Industries had dominated the Indian watch market with almost 10% of the market share. In 1987, A. R. Rahman, who was then still known as Dileep, received his first break in advertising when he was asked to compose the jingle for a new line of Allwyn Trendy Watches. Allwyn Pushpak Allwyn Pushpak 1982 Scooters Andhra Pradesh Scooters Limited (APSL) had manufactured scooters under the brand name Allwyn Pushpak and Piaggio scooters under the name Vespa PL170. Closure and aftermath However, by the mid-1990s the performance of the company was very weak and by 1993 all its reserves were washed off. Hyderabad Allwyn Limited had become sick company when its accumulated losses had exceeded Rs.180 crores (INR 1.8 Billion) as on 31 March 1993 and was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) under the provisions of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985. Hyderabad Allwyn become a company with negative net worth.Restructuring public enterprises in India privatisation and disinvestment By R. K. Mishra, B. Navin, New Delhi, 2002 The BIFR in January 1993 declared Hyderabad Allwyn Ltd., as a sick industry and appointed IDBI as an operating agency to prepare a rehabilitation scheme. The Government of Andhra Pradesh agreed to amalgamate Hyderabad Allwyn Limited's Refrigeration and Appliances division with Voltas Limited, a Tata group company which retained only 5000 Allwyn employees. The company had three divisions: bus body building, watches, and refrigerators. The Watch Division of erstwhile Hyderabad Allwyn Limited was formed into a new company as Allwyn Watches Limited and the Auto and Bus Body division was formed into a new company called Allwyn Auto Ltd. Consequent to the scheme of Amalgamation as approved by the BIFR, M/s.Hyderabad Allwyn Limited ceased to be in existence. The refrigerators division which was privatised in 1994 and handed over to Voltas continued with the Allwyn range of models. In 2002, Voltas themselves sold their refrigerator division to the Sweden based Electrolux, which phased out the Allwyn models. APSL, the scooter division is also presently liquidated. The watch division is now closed and is pending before BIFR. Sale of Allwyn Nissan In 1989 Allwyn Nissan was privatised and sold to Mahindra, renaming the company as Mahindra Nissan Allwyn Ltd. In 1994 MNAL was merged with Mahindra & Mahindra, and the Zahirabad unit is Mahindra & Mahindra's light commercial vehicles unit. The old Allwyn Nissan LCV is still sold by Mahindra as the Mahindra Loadking in various configurations like light tipper and Kerala remains one of its largest markets.

Located on the Olympic Peninsula within Olympic National Park, the Lodge is owned by the National Park Service and operated by Aramark. The Lodge resort is open seasonally from early May until the end of January with select cabins available during the winter months. Hiking and boating are popular activities for guests, and several peaks, including Mount Storm King and Pyramid Mountain, are easily accessible from the resort. Other hiking opportunities include Marymere Falls, Spruce Railroad, and Barnes Creek Trails.  History  In 1914 Avery and Julia Singer built a small hotel and cottages at Barnes Point on the shore of Lake Crescent, opening Singer's Tavern in 1915. At the time of its opening, the Tavern consisted of seven Lodge rooms, five of which are still in use today, and a series of cottages, spending nearly $50,000 on the construction and furnishing of the hotel. The two-story main building was built of locally milled timber, its bungalow-like design influenced by Arts and Crafts design principles, and complemented by Roycroft-inspired furnishings. The main living room featured a large stone fireplace, giving on to a porch overlooking the lake. Guest rooms were located upstairs. Lodge guests were offered modern conveniences, a restaurant, and many recreational and evening activities. Additional accommodations were available in the cottages and tent cabins. Julia Singer planted an ornamental garden, which has matured and which contributes to the hotel's ambiance, together with a small golf course, a vegetable garden and fruit trees.Barnes, p. 71 For the first six years of operation, guests of Singer's Tavern arrived by ferry, which continued to be popular throughout the 1920s. However, when the Olympic Highway was completed in 1922, automobiles quickly became the most popular form of transportation to the Lodge.Barnes, p. 73 A railroad was also constructed on the opposite side of the lake but was never used for passengers. Completed in 1919, the line was engineered to ship logs for airplane manufacturing during World War I but opened only weeks before the war ended. Since then, the Spruce Railroad Trail has become a popular hiking location, accessible by East Beach Road, and remnants of the original railroad can still be seen. The Singers sold the property in 1927 to the Seattle Trust Company and from there it passed to Walter and Bessie Bovee. The events of the 1930s greatly impacted the Lodge and the entire region around the lake. In the latter half of that decade, members of Congress proposed the establishment of a large national park encompassing the central, mountainous region of the Olympic Peninsula, and, as a result, the Lodge received its most notable guest, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the peninsula in the fall of 1937. Roosevelt arrived at the lodge the evening of September 30, where he spent the night in one of the now-demolished cabins, continuing on to the Lake Quinault Lodge the next day. While he was at Singer's Tavern, Roosevelt discussed the proposed Olympic National Park with Park Service and Forest Service advisors, and with Washington senators Monrad Wallgren and Homer T. Bone. Following his tour of the Peninsula, the President signed authorization for the creation of Olympic National Park in 1938, which encompassed the Lake Crescent property. Cottages built in the following decade were consequently named the Roosevelt Cabins. and Walter and Bessie Bovee took ownership and brought the Lodge back to life in the 1940s. They expanded the Lodge and offered many recreational activities, including renting out boats and canoes. A shoreline area called Bovee's Meadow, accessible by a short trail from the Lodge, is a popular recreational area. The lodge remained an inholding through the 1940s, when several new lodges and addition to the main lodge were built. In 1951 the National Park Service bought the lodge and its property for $95,000. The Mission 66 initiative proposed the lodge's demolition and replacement with modern facilities. A number of accessory buildings were removed, but the main lodge was spared, though motel-style units were constructed nearby. Several cabins were replaced with newer units of similar character.Barnes, pp. 76-77 Lake Crescent Lodge is operated by Aramark and opened seasonally from early May through January with select cabins open through winter. Description Lake Crescent Lodge is located at Barnes Point on the south shore of the lake adjacent to Barnes Creek, named after the first homestead built there in the 1890s. This shore is also home to the Olympic Park Institute. Both are situated at the foot of Mount Storm King and encircled with the Olympic Mountain Chain. The Lodge is situated amidst an old-growth forest with rainforest ferns, cedars and fir trees. The irregularly shaped lodge is about by with an enclosed porch on the north side and an open porch on the east side. The main lodge is 2-1/2 stories, with a one-story dining room. The wood- frame lodge is covered with wood shingle siding and a wood-shingled roof. The porch windows feature a complex and finely subdivided mullion pattern in three stages, with smaller panes in each higher stage. The historic district comprises 11 buildings on the lakeshore. The lodge, pier foundations and three cabins are original structures, while seven cabins were rebuilt to complement the earlier buildings. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

It is found on and burrowing in coarse sediments in shallow coastal waters off northwestern Europe. Description U. marina is about long, crescent-shaped and a yellowish-white colour. It is laterally compressed and normally lies on one side. The head is fused with the thorax and bears two unequal sized antennae. In the male, the lower antenna is as long as the body but in the female, it is only just longer than the upper one. The upper antenna has a short side branch. The stalked eyes are black. Those of the male are very large while the female has smaller, oval eyes. The thorax consists of eight somites each with its own appendages and some setae. The posterior pereiopods are wider than they are long and have feathery setae. The uropods are densely hairy and the short telson has a single spine and a few setae.Marine Species Identification Portal Distribution U. marina occurs off the coasts of northwest Europe. Its range includes the North Sea, the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean from the Shetland Isles southwards to the Bay of Biscay. It is usually found in the neritic zone and at depths of down to . Reproduction U. marina becomes sexually mature at about five months old and may live for a year. The sexes are distinct and breeding takes place between April and October. Fertilisation is internal and there are about fifteen eggs, with batches produced every fifteen days or so. The eggs are brooded rather than being liberated into the water column and the juveniles grow rapidly. Biological dispersal of this species is very limited. Ecology The back three legs of U. marina have flattened joints and are used for digging and it can quickly disappear into the substrate. It is often found in association with the sea potato (Echinocardium cordatum), making use of its burrow as a refuge. It also found in association with members of the sea cucumber family, Synaptidae.

Tongseng is commonly found in Indonesian region of Central Java; from Surakarta to Yogyakarta. However, it is believed that dish was originated from Klego district in Boyolali, Central Java. Ingredients and cooking method The term tongseng derived from Javanese term osengan which refer to \\"stir frying\\" to describes its cooking method. It also refer to the \\"seng\\" friction sounds of metal frying spoon against metal wok. The soup is made of ground mixture of garlic, shallot, black pepper, ginger, coriander, galangal, daun salam (Indonesian bay leaves), and lemongrass sauteed with palm oil until it gets aromatic. The diced meat then poured into the sauteed mixture until cooked. Usually the uncooked goat meat from sate kambing (goat satay) are used. Add water until it boiled and add sweet soy sauce with tamarind juice. After the boiled mixture reduces, shredded cabbages and sliced tomato are add to add fresh and crisp texture. Some versions are prepared using coconut milk. Slices of bird's eye chili might be added for those who prefers extra hot and spicy tongseng soup. Tongseng is usually served with hot steamed rice. The soup of tongseng is similar to gulai soup, however gulai is cooked without sweet soy sauce while tongseng mostly appears in brownish gold colour because of the addition of sweet soy sauce. Gulai usually uses beef's offal while tongseng usually only uses meat (goat, lamb, mutton or beef). History A tongseng seller preparing the dish Traditionally, tongseng is considered as the merge between goat satay and gulai spicy soup. According to Indonesian culinary expert, tongseng started to appear in Java between the 18th to 19th century CE. At that time, during colonial era, there were significant influx of Arabs and Muslim Indians migrated into Indonesian archipelago. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Java. Among others are sate kambing, which was believed to be the local adaptation of Indian-Muslim kebabs and gulai, which was a local adaptation of curry-based soup probably influenced by Indian cuisine. During the 19th century, the southern area of Central Java was developed as sugar plantation, thus sugar mills were built. Next to common sugar, traditional Javanese palm sugar (gula jawa) were also produced in the region. Soy sauce factory also built in the region, as the result local Javanese developed kecap manis, which is sweet soy sauce made of a mixture of soy sauce and palm sugar. This sweet soy sauce become the main sauce that combine the savoury gulai soup with pieces of goat satay and the fresh crisp of cabbages and tomato. Today, tongseng is a common dish in Javanese cities of Boyolali, Surakarta (Solo), Klaten, and Yogyakarta, thus most of tongseng sellers hailed from those towns. The dish is also can be found in Indonesian major cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya. Tongseng sellers usually marketed themselves as Warung Sate Solo, a warung or small modest restaurant that specialized in offering satay, tongseng and gulai as their main fare.

Eugen d'Albert, and Theodor Leschetizky. Szalit was regarded as a child prodigy and made numerous appearances in Vienna, Germany and Poland. She received generally superlative notices, such as these: \\"The musical clientele at Vienna are much interested in an infant phenomena, Paula Szalit, aged ten. When she was scarcely out of long clothes, she would pick out on the piano, with one finger, the notes of a tune that she had heard sung, and long before she had any idea of printed notes she would play melodies of her own composition‚Äîsongs, dances, etc. Her musical adroitness was not cultivated until she was seven years old, when she was given lessons, first by her brother, and later by Prof. Fischof and by Eugen d'Albert. It is said that little Paula's playing is charming, not only because of her clear technique and vigorous tone, astonishing from hands so small that they can scarcely stretch an octave, but also because of the artistic feeling she displays. Little Paula has very sensible parents who see that she does not overtax her strength. She has never toured in concert but has appeared in public in Vienna, Prague, and Berlin.\\"(Untitled notice), Werner's magazine (Chicago: Werner's Magazine, v. 19 (Jan.-Aug. 1897), p. 346. And another review: \\"She is mistress of her instrument in every respect; she understands its genius. As far as technique in the ordinary sense goes she has nothing to learn. . . . Her phrasing had the quality of inevitableness, which can never be the effect of the mediocre mind in music. . . . Miss Szalit has also the mind that grasps the inner meaning of the art; the spirituality that sees in it more than sensuous tonal beauty...By almost universal consent she has been recognised as an artist of quite exceptional attainments.\\"E.A.B. as quoted in The Academy and Literature, Jan. 30, 1904, p. 130. Occasionally her reviews were more muted, such as this: \\"Her readings of works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Chopin were lacking in depth of sentiment, but they displayed an intelligence and musical feeling which, combined with a sympathetic touch and great executive facility, testify to exceptional ability.\\" \\"London Concerts and Recitals: Pianoforte Recitals,\\" Musical Times Feb. 1, 1904, p. 120.

Etymology Virtute et armis (Latin \\"By valor and arms\\") is a state motto of Mississippi. It may have been suggested by the motto of Lord Gray De Wilton Virtute non armis fido (\\"I trust in virtue not arms\\"). History The committee to design a coat of arms was appointed by legislative action February 7, 1894, and the design proposed was accepted and became the official coat of arms. The committee recommended for the coat of arms a \\"Shield in color blue, with an eagle upon it with extended pinions, holding in the right talon a palm branch and a bundle of arrows in the left talon, with the word \\"Mississippi\\" above the eagle; the lettering on the shield and the eagle to be in gold; below the shield two branches of the cotton stalk, saltierwise, as in submitted design, and a scroll below extending upward and one each side three-fourths of the length of the shield; upon the scroll, which is to be red, the motto be printed in gold letters upon white spaces, as in design accompanying, the motto to be - \\"Virtute et armis\\", which means by valor and arms. The Coat of Arms of Mississippi has been in use since 2001. Even though the design was made official by the 1894 Mississippi Legislature, the law was not included in the Mississippi Code Revision in 1906. In May 2000 the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the state of Mississippi did not have an official Coat of Arms. On February 7, 2001 Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove signed Senate Bill No. 2885 that designated the original design described above as the official Mississippi Coat of Arms. Other uses Many governmental seals of Mississippi use the state coat of arms in their designs.

While teaching in Northamptonshire, he played club cricket for Kettering, with some success. His bowling later came to the attention of Glamorgan captain Maurice Turnbull when Glamorgan were in the county playing Northamptonshire, Turnbull being told about a Welsh cricketer who was getting \\"a bag of wickets every week\\". He was invited to Cardiff Arms Park for a trial, impressing enough to be given a contract to play in the summer holidays. His first-class debut for Glamorgan against the touring South Africans in 1935 was an eventful one. In Glamorgan's second-innings Hughes, batting at number 11, scoring a quickfire unbeaten 70 runs as he and Cyril Smart put on 131 for the tenth wicket, to help save the match for Glamorgan.

These figures, one of two five wicket hauls he took, came against Leicestershire in 1936. A hard hitting batsman, Hughes scored 274 runs at a batting average of 10.96, with a high score of 70 not out against the South Africans.

Julien Cain (10 May 1887 - 9 October 1974) was the general administrator of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (then called the Biblioth√®que nationale) before the Occupation of France by Nazi Germany. In August 1937, Cain was one of the hosts of the first World Congress of Universal Documentation, held in Paris, which met to further the goal of creating a World Brain, an idea championed by H. G.

In the summer of 1939, before the occupation began, he saw the impending danger clearly enough to order the evacuation of many of the library's most valuable items. Quite soon after the occupation began, Cain was removed from his post by the Vichy government because he was Jewish and replaced by collaborationist Bernard Fa√ø. In February, 1941, Cain was denounced in Le Matin and arrested. He was detained in French prisons until January 1944, when he was sent to Buchenwald. He was freed by American forces in April, 1945, when the camp was liberated. He resumed the administratorship of the Biblioth√®que nationale, which he held until 1964.

Detroit: Gale, 2001. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 26 July 2011. was an American surgeon. He was a significant influence on how breast cancer is treated and was a visible and controversial advocate for alternative procedures. Crile was the son of famous surgeon and founding partner of the Cleveland Clinic, George Washington Crile. After attending the University School and the Hotchkiss School, Crile attended Yale University, where he was on the football and track teams and was a member of Skull and Bones. He graduated in 1929. He earned his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1933, graduating summa cum laude and first in his class. He chose to intern at the Barnes Hospital (1933‚Äì34) under surgeon Evarts Ambrose Graham, noted for successfully removing a lung from a cancer patient. He spent the rest of his medical career at the Cleveland Clinic. After his residency there (1934‚Äì1937), he joined the surgical staff in 1937, served as head of the general surgery department (1956‚Äì1969), senior consultant (1969‚Äì1972), and emeritus consultant (1972‚Äì1992). During World War II, he served in the US Navy (1942‚Äì46), stationed at naval hospitals in San Diego and New Zealand. While in the Navy he researched on ruptured appendixes and discovered that they were not as life-threatening as once believed. He therefore concluded that risky emergency appendectomies on board submarines may harm the patient more than help, and that the safer option was to employ penicillin until the patient could be evacuated to a superior hospital facility. He also developed a procedure for pilonidal cysts, draining them with a catheter instead of the standard surgical excision. He later said \\"I came home from World War II convinced that operations in many fields of surgery were either too radical, or not even necessary. Universal acceptance of a procedure does not necessarily make it right.\\" Crile turned his willingness to question orthodox procedures to breast cancer. The traditional treatment for breast cancer was a radical mastectomy, a procedure which removes the entire breast as well as surrounding muscle, tissue, and lymph nodes. Under the influence of Scottish surgeon Reginald Murley as well as one of his colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic, he instead began to advocate procedures that removed much less material, a simple mastectomy, which only removes the breast, and a lumpectomy, which removes only a small amount of tissue. Crile performed his final radical mastectomy in 1954 and became a public advocate of alternative procedures, which are now standard. In 1955, he published an article, \\"A Plea Against the Blind Fear of Cancer\\", in Life magazine and a book, Cancer and Common Sense. The medical establishment was resistant to the changes he advocated so he sought to influence them through their patients. He was an outspoken critic of traditional procedures for decades and some of his patients, including author Babette Rosmond, became public advocates as well. Crile was an avid author on many subjects, especially medicine and travel. He had a weekly radio program in the 1980s called 90 Seconds on WERE. Crile married Jane Halle in 1935. She died of cancer in 1963. They had three daughters and one son, CBS News producer George Crile III. Their daughter Ann Crile married surgeon Caldwell Esselstyn and their son is author Rip Esselstyn. In 1963, Crile married his second wife, Helga Sandburg, the daughter of poet Carl Sandburg. Crile died of lung cancer at age 84. Bibliography * The Hospital Care of the Surgical Patient: A Surgeon's Handbook (with Franklin L. Shively Jr.), C.

History  The station was first opened on 17 July 1900. During the 1930s it was given a new station building, entry signals and accommodation for the track maintenance gang. The station was only manned by a stationmaster during the summer half-year because, in the winter, no trains ran on the Brocken Railway. After 1961 only goods trains worked the route and, in the 1980s, supply trains for the Brocken, usually moved by a pusher engine, terminated at Goetheweg station because of the increasingly poor condition of the permanent way. All the buildings had been destroyed during the Second World War and had not been rebuilt. Since that time its facilities have only consisted of a garden bench and an operator control for the key lock. The station is not listed in the timetable and is only used as an operating point for train crossings. For a long time it was only equipped with So 5 railway signs (i.e. trapezium boards). Today, however, after changes to the operating system following the train accident in Thumkuhlental in 1994, signals have been installed again.

It normally holds two services a month on the first (9am) and third (2.30pm) Sundays. The church is a Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1837‚Äì38, and has previously been known as Kirkthwaite Chapel, and Cowgill Chapel. It was designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. Its design is similar to that of Holy Trinity Church, Howgill, which dates from the same period. The foundation stone was laid on 30 June 1837 by Adam Sedgwick, Professor of Geology at Cambridge University. The church was consecrated on 31 October 1838 by the Bishop of Ripon. It provided seating for 250 people. The Church of England Commissioners transferred the parish to the Diocese of Carlisle in 2012. Architecture St John's is built of coursed sandstone rubble with slate roofs. Its architectural style is Early English. It has a six-bay nave, a single-bay chancel with a vestry to the north, a south porch, and a bellcote at the west end. Each bay has a lancet window, and there are buttresses between the bays. On the south side of the church is a wooden gabled porch. The bellcote has wooden louvres, and a steep pyramidal roof surmounted by a weathervane. At the gabled west end of the church is a central buttress flanked by lancets, above which is an oculus. The east window is a stepped triple-lancet. Inside the church are wall memorials to members of the Elam family and others. The single-manual organ was built by T Hopkins and Son.

The rebels seized the main garrisons of the Spanish Army in Africa and by 18 July had crushed the resistance of the army officers loyal to the Republican government. The supporters of the Second Spanish Republic were detained or shot.  Background  One of the main goals of the Spanish coup of July 1936 was to secure Spanish Morocco, because the Spanish Army of Africa was the main shock force of the Spanish Republican Army. Their members were Spanish regular soldiers, the Spanish Legion, and Moroccan mercenaries, Regulares. Most of their officers supported the plot and rejected the liberal democracy. Only a handful of officers, such as General Manuel Romerales, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army in Morocco, General Gomez Morato, and the high commissioner, Placido Alvarez Buylla, were loyal to the Republic, and the Spanish workers in Morocco had no weapons and were isolated from the Moroccan population.  Coup   17 July: Melilla  The leader of the plot, Emilio Mola, had ordered the Army of Africa to revolt at 5 a.m. on 18 July, but the plan was discovered by Republican officers of Melilla on 17 July, and the leader of the plot in the city, Colonel Segui, decided to start the rising on Melilla and arrested General Romerales. The rebels seized the radio station and proclaimed the estado de guerra. The Legionnaries, the Regulares, and the Assault Guards in Melilla joined to the rising. Seizing key buildings, they crushed the resistance in the working class quarters. General Romerales, the major of Melilla, the government delegate, the aerodrome commander, Virgilio Leret Ruiz, and all those who resisted the rebellion were shot. When General Morato discovered the rising, he took an airplane to Melilla, but he was arrested by the rebels as soon as he landed.  17 July: Ceuta and Tetu√°n  Segu√≠ then telephoned Ceuta and Tetu√°n and sent a telegraph to Franco at Las Palmas. Colonel Juan Yag√ºe Blanco, with the II Battalion of the Spanish Legion, seized Ceuta while Colonel Saenz de Buruaga, with the V Bandera of the Spanish Legion, took Tetu√°n. The rebel troops in Ceuta occupied the working class districts and killed prominent unionists and the major of the city, and in Tetu√°n, the Foreign Legion seized the Casa del pueblo and executed the union officers and all persons found with arms. Furthermore, Colonel Jan Luis Beigbeder gained the support of the Grand Vizier of Tetu√°n, Mulay Hassan, and Moroccan volunteers started to join the rebellion.  18 July  In Larache the coup started at two o'clock in the morning of 18 July. Several engagements followed in which five assault guards and two rebel officers were killed, but by dawn the town was in the hands of the rebels. By mid-morning the only remaining centres of resistance were the High Commissioner's residence and the air force base at Tetu√°n. The rebels threatened to bomb both and after a few hours the defenders surrendered to the Nationalists; all of them were executed, among them the high commissioner and the Major de la Puente Bahamonde ‚Äì Francisco Franco's cousin. The same day, the workers of Tet√∫an and Melilla attempted a general strike, but were crushed by the insurgent troops.  Nationalist repression  On his secret instructions of 30 June for the coup in Morocco, Mola ordered: \\"to eliminate left-wing elements, communists, anarchists, union members, etc\\". The same day as the rising all the members of trade unions, left-wing parties, Masonic lodges and anyone known to have voted for the Popular Front were arrested. On the first night, the Nationalists executed 189 civilians and soldiers. On 20 July, the Nationalists opened their first Francoist concentration camp in Melilla.  Aftermath  By 18 July, the Spanish Army of Africa had seized all of Spanish Morocco and crushed the resistance. The same day, Francisco Franco started the rising in the Canary Islands. Then he took a De Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft, paid for by Luis Bol√≠n, and flew to Casablanca in French Morocco. On 19 July, Franco continued on to Tetuan and appointed himself chief of the Spanish Army in Morocco. Most of the Republican Navy remained loyal to the government. The loyal ships patrolled the Strait of Gibraltar and Spanish Morocco was isolated from the rebel-held cities in Andalusia; Seville, Cadiz, Cordoba and Granada). Nevertheless, with the aid of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, the Nationalists managed to transport the Army of Africa's troops to the mainland and start their advance towards Madrid.

The 17‚Äì18 July coup failed in the Andalusian cities of Malaga, Jaen and Huelva, but succeeded in Cordoba, Granada, Cadiz and in the capital city, Seville. The city's garrison, led by Queipo de Llano, occupied the city and carried out a bloody repression. In August 1936, the Nationalists started their advance towards Madrid from Seville. Background On 17‚Äì18 July a part of the Spanish army, led by a group of officers (among them the generals Sanjurjo, Franco, Mola, Goded and Queipo de Llano), tried to overthrow the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic. One of the main goals of the coup was to take control of the main cities of the country, among them Seville. Seville was the capital city of Andalusia and the most revolutionary city of southern Spain.Jackson p. 237 Plot Queipo de Llano, the leader of the coup in Seville, claimed that he seized Seville with a small force of 130 soldiers and 15 civilians. Also, he said that alone and gun-at-hand he had arrested the republican general Villa-Abrile and after he had convinced the entire garrison to join the rising. The coup in Seville was planned by the chief of staff of Seville, Jos√© Cuesta Moreneo who barely could gather 150 men. Most of the units were on summer leave. The commander of the Second Military Division, General Jose Villa-Abrille, was aware of the plotters' preparations, but he did nothing.Preston pp. 105-106 Coup On 17 July, Queipo de Llano, who was the chief of the carabineros (the frontier police) came to Seville in a tour of inspection.Jackson p. 236 In the morning of 18 July, Queipo de Llano accompanied by his ADC and three officers, entered in the office of the general Villa-Abrille and arrested him. After that he went to the San Hermenigildo barracks and detained the colonel of the 6th regiment, Manuel Allanegi, who had refused to join the rising. Then the artillery regiment also joined the rising and the rebel troops surrounded and bombed the gobierno civil (civil government), held by loyal assault guards. The civil governor (delegate of the Spanish government) surrendered after Queipo promised to save their lives, but the chief of the police and the assault guards were executed. Then the Civil Guard in Seville joined to the rebellion.Beevor pp. 59-60 The civil governor, Jos√© Mar√≠a Varela Rendueles, was sentenced to death by the rebels, but the sentence was reduced to 30 years' imprisonment.Espinosa pp. 76-77 A general strike was ordered by the trade unions, the workers withdrew into their own districts of Triana and La Macarena and built barricades, but they only had a few weapons. The rebel troops (4,000 men) seized the nerve centers of the city, occupying the telephone exchange, the town hall and the radio station, and establishing control routes into the center of the city. On 20 July, the rebels bombed the working-class districts of Seville, and after the rebel troops supported by the troops of the Spanish Legion arrived from Africa, 50 civil guards, 50 requetes and 50 falangists entered in the Triana and Macarena districts, using women and children as human shields, and started a bloody repression.Preston p. 106 The legionaries killed with knives all the men whom they found.Thomas pp. 240-241 On 21 July, the Castejon's V Bandera of the Spanish Legion assaulted the districts of La Macarena, San Juli√°n, San Bernardo and El Pumarejo. By 25 July the Nationalists occupied all Seville. According to the Queipo's press assistant: \\"In the working-class districts, the Foreign Legion and Moroccan regulares went up and down the streets of very modest one-story houses, throwing grenades in the windows, blowing up and killing women and children. The Moors took the opportunity to loot and rape at will.

Most of the army officers in the city supported the coup, but the Civil Guard, the Assault Guard (Guardia de Asalto) and the Mossos d'Esquadra remained loyal to the government. Furthermore, Barcelona was one of the strongholds of the anarchist union, the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). The rebel troops were defeated after bloody combat. The defeat of the military coup in Barcelona was a great success for the Republic, although after the defeat of the Francoists it became clear that the workers' militias - in particular, the anarcho- syndicalist militias - were the ones that really controlled the city. The defeat of the rebels marked the beginning of the Spanish Revolution and also the beginning of a harsh repression in Catalonia against those elements of being \\"fascist\\" or opposed to the revolution. Background On July 17‚Äì18, a part of the Spanish army, led by a group of officers (among them the generals Jos√© Sanjurjo, Francisco Franco, Emilio Mola, Manuel Goded Llopis and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano), tried to overthrow the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish coup of July 1936. One of the main goals of the coup was to take control of the main cities of the country, among them Barcelona. Opposing forces In Barcelona, the plotters led by the General Fern√°ndez Burriel planned to use the troops of the garrisons in the periphery of the city, about 5000 men of the IV division of the Spanish Army in order to march towards the city center and join up in the Pla√ßa de Catalunya. Then they would occupy the city and wait the arrival of General Goded. The general Llano de la Encomienda, commander of the IV division, stayed loyal to the government, but most of the officers supported the coup. Nevertheless, the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) in Barcelona, led by General Jos√© Aranguren; the Guardia de Asalto; and the Catalan police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, led by Captain Frederic Escofet, (around 5000 men) remained loyal to the government.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.221-223 Also remaining loyal was El Prat air base, commanded by Colonel Felipe D√≠az Sandino, whose planes bombed the rebel troops. On 18 July news about a rising of the Army of Africa in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco reached Barcelona, but the president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Llu√≠s Companys, refused to give weapons to the workers and ordered anarchists carrying weapons to be detained. Nevertheless, the CNT, led by Buenaventura Durruti and Francisco Ascaso, assaulted some army depots and the prison ship Uruguay, and started to manufacture home-made grenades and improvised armoured cars. Furthermore, Assault Guards handed out rifles to the CNT.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. p.67 The fight in Barcelona Before dawn of 19 July, four in the morning, the officers in the Pedralbes Barrack told their soldiers that the government had ordered them to crush an anarchist rising in Barcelona. The troops left the Barracks and marched towards the Pla√ßa de Catalunya, through the Avinguda Diagonal. Soon after, Companys received the news of the troops advancing towards the city. At five in the morning, the Montesa cavalry regiment, the Santiago dragoons regiment and a battery of the 7th light Regiment left their barracks and marched towards the Pla√ßa de Catalunya, but the deployment of troops was badly co-ordinated and the junction of the rebels columns was never achieved. The rebel troops were attacked by snipers and with home-made bombs. The anarchists built barricades with paving stones in order to block the city center, and the Guardia Civil and the Assault Guards joined them against the rebel troops.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. p.68 Some units were forced to retreat into their barracks and others never broke into the streets, but an infantry column, led by Major Lopez Amor, reached the Pla√ßa de Catalunya and occupied the telephone exchange,Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.224 and other units occupied the Hotel Col√≥n and the Ritz and barricaded themselves. At 11 a.m., General Goded arrived from Mallorca, went to the captain-general's headquarters, and arrested the commander of the IV Division, General Llano de la Encomienda, but the situation of the rebel troops was hopeless. After bloody combats in the Pla√ßa de Catalunya and other parts of the city, the anarchists and the loyal troops surrounded all the rebel-held buildings in the city. The Civil Guards, led by the Colonel Antonio Escobar, assaulted the Hotel Col√≥n and the Ritz and the anarchists occupied the telephone exchange. After that, Goded surrendered and broadcast a statement over the radio to prevent further bloodshed. By nightfall, the rebel troops only held the Drassanes barracks, near the port and the Andreu barracks.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. pp.68-69 The next morning the anarchists, led by Buenaventura Durruti, assaulted the barracks and the rebel troops surrendered. Ascaso died during the assault, but the CNT seized 30,000 rifles in the barracks. There were over 500 deaths and 3,000 wounded.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.237 Aftermath After the defeat of the coup in Barcelona, the CNT was the real power in the city until the May Days in 1937. After the coup, the CNT had 30,000 armed men and women in Barcelona, while the government had only 5000.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.237-238  Political implications  After the failed uprising in Barcelona, the city was practically in the hands of the workers' militias, which had obtained the armament of the military arsenals and had a force of armed men far superior to the security forces with which both the Central Government as the Generalitat could count. Hugh Thomas believes that at the end of the military rebellion in Barcelona the security forces had 5,000 armed men, while the CNT-FAI had about 30,000 armed men. Thus, although the loyal forces had managed to defeat the insurgents, the reality was that the workers' movement had taken control of the city and had supplanted the authority and powers of Catalan government and Spanish State. Due to this situation, the same night of July 20 the anarchist leaders Juan Garc√≠a Oliver, Diego Abad de Santill√°n and Buenaventura Durruti visited Llu√≠s Companys on the occasion of the new situation that had been created. Companys could have used the security forces to force the workers to return the rifles and ammunition they had confiscated, but he was in dangerous territory and preferred to offer the anarchists the possibility of taking power or collaborating with the state. The anarchist leaders, despite the historical experience of the liberal movement, opted for the second option, although the state would have a fairly limited role as would be demonstrated in the following months. From this meeting between Companys and the main anarchist leaders would come the creation of the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia (CCMA), which would be the real government in Barcelona for many months. This marked the beginning of what has become known as the Spanish Revolution. The situation would not be, far from it, consolidated and a large number of conflicts and confrontations would take place in the city during the following months, in an escalation that would end up leading to the May Days. The solid implementation of the control of the republican government over Barcelona allowed its counterintelligence agencies to significantly reduce the activities of the fifth column affects the rebel faction, as well as discover and arrest almost all the leaders of Falange that had survived the failed uprising.  Repression and violence in the rear  The officers and main leaders of the rebellion who had been arrested were initially taken to Castle of Montju√Øc, where they remained until July 26 they were transferred to the prison ship Uruguay , in the city's port. During the time they were imprisoned on the prison ship, the prisoners were treated correctly: they were allowed to sit on the deck and read novels from the ship's library. However, the provocative attitude Many of the detainees were grounds for the authorities to end these privileges. The officers involved in the conspiracy were tried in court martial by the republican authorities, aboard the Uruguay . The general Manuel Cardenal presided over the military tribunal that judged the rebellious officers. On August 11, Generals Goded and Fern√°ndez Burriel were tried for having directed the military rebellion, condemned to death and shot the next day in the moat of Montjuic Castle. The general Legorburu would also end up being executed A few days later, on August 26, after being tried in court martial, other ringleaders of the rebellion were also shot: the Infantry commander L√≥pez-Amor, and the captains L√≥pez Belda, L√≥pez Varela and Lizcano de la Rosa.

Biography Earlier career After finishing in the military academy of St. Cyr in 1879, he was assigned as a sub-lieutenant in the infantry. He graduated from the √âcole de Guerre eight years later. He alternated between staff and regimental service, serving in Algeria and the Alps. In 1905, he was chosen to be an instructor at √âcole de Guerre, after serving as director of studies and commander of the cadet battalion at St. Cyr. During this time he wrote Les Japonais des Mandchourie (The Japanese in Manchuria), which soon became known as an important critical work on the Russo-Japanese war and was translated into several languages (English translation: Part I, 1912; Part II, 1914). In 1910, he was promoted to colonel and was given the command of an infantry regiment. World War I With his staff, Florina 1916 In 1913, he was given command of the new 87th Brigade and made general of brigade. His brigade distinguished itself at the battle of the Mangiennes, 10 August 1914 and the battle of the Ardennes. He directed the 3rd Division at the battle of the Marne, the advance to Sainte-Menehould and the Argonne, being wounded on 15 September 1914. By December 1914, after being made an officer of the Legion of Honour, he led his division in bitter trench warfare in the Argonne, later being in command of a group of divisions at Alsace in January 1914. He was made a commander in the Legion of Honour and in July 1916 was given command of the French troops of the Salonika armies under Maurice Sarrail, later referred to as Arm√©e fran√ßaise d'Orient. Commanding the left wing of the Entente's autumn offensive, he saw action at Ostrovo, Florina, Armenohor and Kenali. However, his and Sarrail's differences led him to be reassigned. Post war After arriving back in France, Cordonnier, being terribly ill, was taken to hospital and underwent surgery for cancer. He was unable to return to active duty due to his health and instead went into retirement.

Background  Zadro started boxing under Jimmy Sharman in 1972 at Mareeba, North Queensland, and he trained in Judo under the Kodokan Judo Association from 1973 to 1975. After moving to Sydney with his family, he studied Tae Kwon Do from 1975 to 1979 at the Marconi Club in Bossley Park, and attained the rank of Junior Black Belt. In 1979 he went on to study Ken Sei Kan Karate Do and continued on until 1981 at Greystanes, Sydney where he attained the rank of Shodan (first degree black belt). From 1979 to 1983 he also studied Koshu Kempo under Tony Lucisano at Bossley Park, Sydney and he also attained the rank of Shodan in that art. He studied Brazilian jiu-jujitsu with good friend Anthony Perosh. Perosh still states that Paul was his first instructor until he went overseas to pursue Brazilian jiu-jujitsu. He was awarded his Sandan (third degree black belt) by the International Kempo Karate Academy in 1983, and Godan (fifth degree black belt) by WCMA in 1995.

The bulk of the security forces in Madrid remained loyal to the government, and supported by workers' militias, crushed the uprising.  Background  On 17‚Äì18 July 1936, a part of the Spanish army, led by a group of officers‚Äîamong them Generals Jose Sanjurjo, Francisco Franco, Emilio Mola, Manuel Goded and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano‚Äîtried to overthrow the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic. The occupation of the capital, Madrid, was one of the prime goals of the coup of July 1936. This coup in this particular location was ill-planned and clumsily executed. There was no coordination between the diverse elements who were hostile to the republic ‚Äì falangists, some army officers, and members of the Spanish Military Union. The coordinator of the plot in Madrid, Colonel Valent√≠n Galarza Morante had been detained and the elderly and indecisive General Villegas took his place. However Villegas decided at the last minute to avoid direct participation and General Joaqu√≠n Fanjul replaced him at short notice. There was a particularly strong concentration of pro-government forces in Madrid. These included para-military security forces and organized‚Äîthough at this stage generally unarmed‚Äîunion groups. Finally, a large portion of the officers and soldiers of the regular Madrid army garrison were uninvolved in the plot and pre-disposed to remain loyal to the elected government. Located on the Pr√≠ncipe P√≠o near the former Royal Palace of Madrid to the west of the central city, the Monta√±a barracks had been built in 1860. It consisted of three separate buildings joined together to make up a large fortress-like structure, fronted by a wide glacis and parapets. It was normally garrisoned by three regiments of infantry, a regiment of engineers and additional specialist units, although in July 1936 many of the soldiers were on summer leave. A further eight regiments, plus four independent battalions and two artillery groups, were based in other garrisons located in and around the city. Finally, 25 companies of Assault Guards and 14 of Civil Guards were either located in Madrid or had been brought in by the Republican authorities shortly before the July rising. The role of these trained security forces was to prove crucial.  The coup in Madrid   18 July  On 18 July, news of the military rising in Spanish Morocco reached Madrid, and the General Union of Workers and National Confederation of Labor demanded the distribution of arms. However the government initially refused to give weapons to civilians. Nevertheless, a group of young officers led by Lieutenant Colonel Rodrigo Gil Ruiz distributed 5,000 rifles among the workers. The plotters had planned that General Garc√≠a Herr√°n would seize the army camp at Carabanchel and General Fanjul would occupy the inner city from the Monta√±a barracks, located on the Pr√≠ncipe P√≠o, close to the Plaza de Espa√±a. Other rebel officers should then have taken over the Cuatro Vientos and Getafe Air Bases, but the plan failed. Furthermore, the commander of the Civil Guard in Madrid, General Sebasti√°n Pozas Perea and the Assault Guard‚Äîaround 6,000 men‚Äîremained loyal to the government.  19 July  On 19 July, the new government of Prime Minister Jos√© Giral decided to issue weapons to the unions; 65,000 rifles were handed over, but only 5,000 had bolts. The other 60,000 bolts were stored separately at the Monta√±a barracks. The commander of the barracks, Colonel Mois√©s Serra, disregarded the order of the Minister of War to hand over this essential equipment, effectively marking the beginning of the uprising in Madrid. On the morning of 19 July, General Fanjul arrived at the Monta√±a barracks, as did groups of officers from the other Madrid garrisons and a number of falangist and monarchist volunteers. After giving a lecture to his fellow officers on the political goals of the military rising, Fanjul tried to advance into the central city streets with his troops, now numbering approximately 2,000 officers, military cadets and soldiers plus 500 volunteers. A crowd of about 8,000 organized by the National Confederation of Labor and the General Union of Workers, some armed, had gathered around the barracks. Assault Guards were seen taking up firing positions on the roofs of neighboring buildings. Fanjul decided to withdraw into the barracks complex and await help from the other garrisons of the city, rather than attempt to break through the siege. The coup had failed in the other city garrisons. In Carabanchel, General Garc√≠a Herr√°n had been killed by his own troops while trying to raise them against the government and the artillery barracks there had been secured by loyalist officers. The engineer units at El Pardo had been withdrawn to the north by their officers under the pretext of suppressing risings elsewhere in Spain. The First Infantry Regiment at Retiro had surrendered their barracks to government forces without opposition. Finally at the Getafe Air Base, rebels had been defeated by loyal troops after the death of an air force officer. This permitted flights to be made over the Monta√±a barracks the next day, initially to drop leaflets and then bombs. The communist-led Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias formed five battalions that took an active part in the siege. One of these battalions became the renowned Fifth Regiment.  20 July  On the morning of 20 July, two 75 mm guns commanded by a retired artillery officer Captain Orad, plus one 155 mm gun joined the siege. Also, a Breguet XIX warplane from the Cuatro Vientos Air Base bombed the barracks. At half past ten, one bomb wounded Fanjul and Serra. A few moments later some soldiers inside the barracks waved a white sheet from the windows apparently with the intention of surrendering. Against the orders of Lieutenant Moreno of the Assault Guards, who were leading the attack, the crowd ran forward but other defenders fired at them from the barracks with machine guns. This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Orad and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess room and then shot themselves. At least some of the falangist and monarchist volunteers wearing civilian clothes were able to slip away in the confusion. Colonel Serra was among those killed immediately after the fall of the barracks. The wounded General Fanjul together with other surviving rebel officers, was detained in Madrid's Model Prison for trial. Of the 145 rebel officers who had been at the Monta√±a barracks, 98 died in the fighting, were killed after surrender, committed suicide, or were subsequently executed. Some of the garrison were reportedly killed by attackers with axes, knives and mallets. Total losses among the defenders are estimated at between 200 and 1000 dead while the casualties among the attacking forces appear to have been significantly lighter. The rifle bolts and ammunition that had been the immediate cause of the attack on the barracks were seized by Assault Guards and taken to the Ministry of War.  Aftermath  After having defeated the rebel troops in Madrid, columns of militia, civil guards and assault guards left Madrid and occupied Alcala de Henares and Guadalajara. Later, Fanjul and Villegas were convicted and executed for military rebellion. The damaged barracks remained in ruinous condition until it was demolished and the area added to the public gardens of Calle de Ferraz (Ferraz Street).

It was part of the Spanish coup of July 1936 against the Second Spanish Republic, which led to the start of the Spanish Civil War.  Background  In the Basque province of √Ålava, the city of Vitoria was easily seized by the rebels led by the general Angel Garc√≠a Benitez and the Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega, but the rising failed in the Biscay and Gipuzkoa provinces. The Basque nationalists supported the government, established Juntas de Defensa in all the cities and towns, arrested right-wing personalities, and requisitioned their automobiles. There was no military uprising in Bilbao. There was an unsuccessful uprising in San Sebasti√°n, however.  Uprising  On 19 July 1936, the military governor of San Sebasti√°n, Colonel Le√≥n Carrasco Amilibia, was arrested, but the commander of the Loyola barracks, Colonel Jos√© Vallesp√≠n Cobi√°n, encouraged by Emilio Mola, decided to start the uprising against the government. Vallesp√≠n pointed his cannons at the civil government, and the staff inside fled. Carrasco escaped from his captors and declared a state of war. Carrasco established himself with right-wing supporters in the Mar√≠a Cristina hotel, and the Civil Guard in the city supported the rising and seized the Gran Casino. On 20 July, a column from Eibar, about southeast of Loyola, led by Colonel Augusto P√©rez Garmendia, came to the city and surrounded the buildings held by the rebels. On 23 July, the Republican forces occupied the Mar√≠a Cristina hotel, and on 27 July, the rebels in the Loyola barracks surrendered to the besieging forces. Spanish anarchists seized the weapons inside the barracks and shot some right-wing prisoners, worsening their relations with the Basque nationalists. The nationalists occupied San Sebasti√°n on 14 September.

State: Arkansas Roll: 0124 Captain Daniel Turrentine of Company G, 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiment  Service  The 12th Arkansas served in the Western Department, and later at Beall's Brigade, Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. The regiment had the unfortunate distinction of being captured in two engagements: Battle of Island Number Ten, and the Siege of Port Hudson. Island Number Ten After serving in the garrison at Columbus Kentucky, the regiment moved to New Madrid, Missouri. Island Number Ten was a strategic location with an island at the base of a tight double turn in the course of the Mississippi river, near the town of New Madrid, Missouri. The 12th Arkansas, brigaded together with the 11th Arkansas Infantry, under the command of Colonel Gantt, originally acted as the garrison for Fort Thompson, one of two forts that guarded New Madrid.War of the Rebellion: Serial 008 Page 0128 OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND T. Chapter XVIII. Due to his role as a brigade commander, On December 7, 1861, General Leonidas Polk nominated Gantt to become a Brigadier General, but he was never confirmed at that rank by the Confederate Congress. Union forces began a siege in March 1862, shortly after the Confederate Army abandoned their position at Columbus, Kentucky. The Union Army of the Mississippi under Brigadier General John Pope, made the first probes, coming overland through Missouri and occupying the town of Point Pleasant, Missouri, almost directly west of the island and south of New Madrid. Pope's army then moved north and soon brought siege guns to bear on New Madrid. The Confederate commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, decided to evacuate the town after only one day of heavy bombardment, moving most of his troops to Island No. 10, abandoning his heavy artillery and most of his supplies. Gantt's Brigade now included the 11th and 12 Arkansas Infantry Regiments, the 4th Arkansas Infantry Battalion, may of whom were manning guns on Island No. 10. and the 55th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. Two days after the fall of New Madrid, Union gunboats and mortar rafts sailed downstream to attack Island Number Ten. Over the next three weeks, the island's defenders and forces in the nearby supporting batteries were subjected to a steady bombardment by the flotilla, mostly carried out by the mortars. At the same time, the Union forces at New Madrid were digging a canal across the neck of land east of the town to bypass Island No. 10. Several transports were sent to the Army of the Mississippi when the canal was finished, which provided the army with a way to cross the river and attack the Confederate troops on the Tennessee side. Pope persuaded Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote to send a gunboat past the batteries, to assist him in crossing the river by keeping off any Southern gunboats and suppressing Confederate artillery fire at the point of attack. The USS Carondelet, under Commander Henry Walke, slipped past the island on the night of April 4, 1862. This was followed by the USS Pittsburg, under Lieutenant Egbert Thompson two nights later. With the support of these two gunboats, Pope was able to move his army across the river and trap the Confederates opposite the island, who by now were trying to retreat. Outnumbered at least three to one, the Confederates realized their situation was hopeless and decided to surrender.Daniel, Larry J. and Lynn N. Bock., Island No. 10: Struggle for the Mississippi Valley. University of Alabama Press, 1996. The bulk of the 12th Arkansas was captured at Island Number Ten and sent to prisoner of war camps with the other captured regiments from that post. At the prison camps, they joined with those regiments previously captured at Ft Donelson. As was the case with other regiments, there were escapees from the surrender of Island Number Ten, including those in hospital or on detached duty, etc. The members of the 12th Arkansas who avoided capture at Island Number Ten were consolidated into two companies assigned on June 16, 1862, as second companies D and F of the 6th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. These two companies from the 12th Arkansas, accompanied the 6th Arkansas on Bragg's Kentucky campaign. The two companies that accompanied the 6th Arkansas on the Kentucky Campaign were unable to rejoin the exchanged regiment until about December 1862:Odom, Danny, 12th Arkansas Infantry, Arkansas, in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 4 January 2007, 3:13 pm, Accessed 25 July 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=14234 Still other escapees of the 12th Arkansas were consolidated with the 14th and 23rd Arkansas regiments on September 10, 1862, at Saltillo, MS, to form the 12th/14th/23rd Arkansas consolidated regiment. Prisoners of the 12th Arkansas were delivered to Vicksburg, Mississippi, on or about September 16, and/or September 23, 1862. The regiment was then reorganized by the election of new officers on October 2, 1862, at Jackson, Mississippi. The 12th Arkansas was officially \\"exchanged\\" on November 10, 1862. Because Col. Gantt was confined as a prisoner at Fort Warren, when the 12th Arkansas was exchanged and reorganized at Jackson, T. J. Reid, Jr, was elect to the Colonelcy. The other regimental officers elected at the reorganization were: *Lieutenant Colonel Ed Jordan *Major Walker *Adjutant Hemingway *Quartermaster Jonas The company commanders elected in this new organization were: *Company A, Captain Stewart *Company B, Captain Donnell *Company C, Captain Johnson *Company D, Captain Linzee *Company E, Captain Glasgow *Company F, Captain Bowen *Company G, Captain Doggett *Company H, Captain J.E. Inge *Company I, Captain Archer *Company K, Captain Davis After the surrender of Island Number Ten, many of the soldiers refused to return to the command. A number of soldier returned to Arkansas and were caught up in Major General Thomas Hindman's aggressive recruiting and conscription efforts in the summer if 1862 and were enlisted into the newly formed 33rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment. There were too few men to bring the regiment up to effective strength, so the officers were granted leave to return to Arkansas to recruit replacements, while the enlisted men were temporarily attached to the 11th Arkansas under the command of Colonel Logan.Hempstead, Fay, \\"A Pictorial History of Arkansas\\" St. Louis and New York, N. D. Thompson publishing company, 1890, Call number: 9197481, Page 406, Accessed 24 August 2011, https://archive.org/stream/pictorialhistory00hemp#page/406/mode/2up When the officers returned to the regiment, the added recruits brought its strength up to approximately 500 men in the ranks. Colonel Gantt remained imprisoned until where he stayed until his negotiated release in August 1862. He then returned to south Arkansas and awaited the offer of a new command, but this offer never came. Apparently Gantt had been criticized for drinking and flirting with officers wives. After waiting for more than a year for the offer of a new commission in the Confederate Army, Gantt, surrendered himself to General Grant at Vicksburg and quickly became a force in the move to organize a new loyal, pro Union Government in Arkansas. Following the war, during Reconstruction, he would become general superintendent of the Southwest District of Arkansas of the Freedmen's Bureau, a federal agency created at the end of the war to help former slaves.Randy Finley, \\"Edward W.

The regiment, once it regained sufficient strength to operate independently, became a part of Brig. Genl. William Beall's Center Brigade in the Port Hudson entrenchments. The regiment endured forty-eight day siege, and was surrendered to General Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, 1863. Following the capitulation of Port Hudson, the enlisted men were paroled, but the officers were sent to Johnson's Island.Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Stanford University Press, 2001, Camden Expedition, Red River Campaign There are few records of the 12th Arkansas after the fall of Port Hudson. After being paroled, the enlisted personnel of the 12th Arkansas made their way to parole camps near Camden in south Arkansas and were eventually declared exchanged.

Gurzadyan was born in Yerevan, Armenia (then USSR), graduated Yerevan State University (1977), postgraduate student in Theoretical Physics department, Lebedev Physics Institute, Moscow (1977‚Äì1980; 1980 PhD.), DSci in Theoretical and mathematical physics (1988). In 1989 he lectured on dynamical systems in four universities in Japan, and subsequently held visiting positions at the University of Sussex (1996‚Äì1997) and, since 2001, at Sapienza University of Rome. His father Grigor Gurzadyan, an Armenian astronomer pioneered space-based astronomy using satellites. His grandfather Ashkharbek Kalantar was a Russian Empire and Armenian archaeologist and historian, Fellow of Russian Imperial Archaeological Society and the keeper of the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg.http://ysu.am/gender/en/The-bust-of-Ashkharbek- Kalantar-was-placed-at-YSU  Main research  The main topics of his research: chaos in non-linear systems, accretion onto massive black holes, stellar dynamics, observational cosmology. Gurzadyan has papers predicting elliptical accretion disks formed in galactic nuclei at tidal disruption of stars near massive black holes; the tidal mechanism currently is associated to the flares observed in AGN. He has shown (with Savvidy) the exponential instability (chaos) in spherical stellar systems and has derived the collective relaxation time. He has formulated a list of 10 key problems in stellar dynamics Cosmic microwave background indications for voids - large scale underdense regions - were obtained by Gurzadyan et al., including on the void nature of the Cold Spot, confirmed by independent galaxy survey, as of possibly largest known structure in the Universe.  Other topics  Gurzadyan has suggested and initiated the use of Compton Edge method for high accuracy testing of the light speed isotropy and the Lorentz invariance at GRAAL experiment in European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble); the obtained limit became a reference number for Special Relativity extension models. Gurzadyan has coined the concept of information panspermia which Webb attributed as Solution 23 of Fermi Paradox. That concept includes the hypothesis that the Universe can be full of traveling extraterrestrial life streams as low-complexity compressed bit strings at von Neumann automata network. He has shown that human genome and hence the terrestrial life possess low Kolmogorov complexity and hence the corresponding bit strings can be transmitted by Arecibo-type antenna to Galactic distances. Gurzadyan and Penrose discussed information panspermia within the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, and the cosmic microwave background radiation transferring information from pre-Big Bang aeon to ours. He led a study with geneticists in Duke University introducing a new method to detect somatic mutations in genomic sequences, in proposing bath-quantum system viewpoint on the relation of thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time.

Life Ely was the brother of William Ely, president of St John's College, Oxford, and was a native of Herefordshire. After studying at Brasenose College, Oxford, he was elected a scholar of St John's College in 1566. On account of his attachment to the Catholic faith he left the university without a degree. He went to the English college at Douay, where he was made a licentiate in the canon and civil laws. He appears to have been subsequently created LL.D. 1570s In July 1577 he and other students of law formed a community in the town of Douay and resided together in a rented house. This establishment was soon broken up by the troubles with local Calvinists. Ely was hooted as a traitor in the streets of Douay, and the members of his community and of the English college were subjected to frequent domiciliary visits; which satisfied the municipal authorities but not the populace. In consequence William Allen found it necessary to move the college from Douay to Rheims in 1578. After studying divinity at Rheims Ely accompanied Allen to Rome in August 1579, when the dissensions had occurred in the English college there, but he returned with him to Rheims in the following spring. During his stay in Rome, Allen employed him in revising several controversial books. 1580s In June 1580 he visited England, disguised as a merchant, travelling under the name of Havard or Howard. Sailing with him were three priests: Edward Rishton, Thomas Cottam, and John Hart. On their landing at Dover the searchers arrested Cottam and Hart. The mayor, supposing that Ely was a military man, requested him to convey Cottam to London and hand him over to Lord Cobham, governor of the Cinque ports. When they were out of the town, Ely allowed his prisoner to go at large. Cottam, entertaining scruples about the danger that his friend might incur, insisted upon delivering himself up and was afterwards executed. Ely was committed to prison, but soon obtained his release, probably on account of his not being a priest. On 23 April 1581 he arrived at Rheims, out of Spain, and in the following month visited Paris, in company with Allen. He was ordained subdeacon at Laon on 8 March 1581‚Äì2, deacon at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne on the 31st of the same month, and priest on 14 April 1582. On 22 July 1586 he left Rheims for Pont-√†-Mousson, where he had been appointed by the Duke of Lorraine to the professorship of the canon and civil laws, and he occupied that chair till his death on 15 March 1603‚Äì4. He was buried in the church of the nuns of the order of St. Clare. Works He wrote ‚ÄòCertaine Briefe Notes vpon a Briefe Apologie set out vnder the name of the Priestes vnited to the Archpriest. Drawn by an vnpassionate secular Prieste, friend to bothe partyes, but more frend to the truth. Whereunto is added a seuerall answeare vnto the particularites obiected against certaine Persons,‚Äô Paris (1603). This work, elicited by Robert Parsons's ‚ÄòBrief Apology,‚Äô was written by Ely shortly before his death and published by an anonymous editor, probably Dr. Christopher Bagshaw. It was a contribution to the archpriest controversy. Ely wrote in English, with a view to publication, the lives of some of the martyrs in Elizabeth's reign, as appears from a letter addressed by him from Pont-√†- Mousson, 20 June or July 1587, to Father John Gibbons, S. J., rector of the college of Treves.

His most notable work is Calendarium Pastorale (). Life Bathurst was descended from an ancient family of Hothorpe in Northamptonshire, and a relative of Dr Ralph Bathurst, the famous English physician, scholar, and divine. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1602, but graduated BA in 1606 from Pembroke College, the college to which Edmund Spenser belonged. Bathurst led a private life, and was a man of little ambition. So much the more, says one of his editors, he deserved honour as he desired it less. Works While at Pembroke, he executed his translation of Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender. He wrote the first two ecologues at Pembroke, which were dedicated to Thomas Neville, master of Trinity College, Cambridge. This translation had the honour of being highly commended by Sir Richard Fanshawe, who has himself left us specimens of Latin translations of English verse. Bathurst's translation was edited first by Dr William Dillingham of Emmanuel College, and dedicated to Francis Lane. It was republished by John Ball, who, in his address to the reader, says he had much and long labour in procuring a copy of Bathurst's work. It was then already rare among the booksellers. Ball's edition is accompanied by the original eclogues on the opposite pages. He speaks of Bathurst, in the address above mentioned, as He added a Latin dissertation, De vita Spenseri et scriptis (; Lond. 8vo, no date and 1732). The precise title of Bathurst's book is: :Calendarium Pastorale sive Eclog√¶ duodecim totidem anni mensibus accommodat√¶ Anglic√® olim script√¶ ab Edmundo Spenser Anglorum poetarum principe; nunc autem eleganti Latino carmine donat√¶ a Theodoro Bathurst Aul√¶ Pembrochian√¶ apud Cantabrigienses aliquando socio (; Lond. 8vo, 1653). In 1653 when the first edition of a parallel text was released, John Hacket offered some insights into its origins, which he passed to the reviser of the text William Dillingham, master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Emmanuel was at the forefront of the Puritan movement in intellectual circles, presenting the orthodox position on the doctrine of the trinity. Dillingham's text was included in the 1679 text of Spenser's Works, which was reissued in 1732.

Ojoraptorsaurus is only known from pubic bones found at the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation dating to the early Maastrichtian, about 69 million years ago. It was first named by Robert M. Sullivan, Steven E. Jasinski and Mark P.A. van Tomme in 2011 and the type species is Ojoraptorsaurus boerei. The generic name combines a reference to the formation with a Latin raptor, \\"plunderer\\", and a Latinised Greek saurus, \\"lizard\\". The specific name honours oceanographer Arjan Boer√© who found the specimen.  Description  The holotype of Ojoraptorsaurus is SMP VP-1458, an incomplete pair of fused pubes. Due to the fusion of the pubes, this specimen is believed to have been a mature individual. Most caenagnathid species are known from very few remains, and Ojoraptorsaurus is no exception. The holotype was compared to well-described pubic remains of other oviraptorosaurians, namely Microvenator, Epichirostenotes, Nomingia, and CM 78001 (now known as Anzu). It shares with the latter three taxa an enclosed fossa on the inside edge of the pubis near the acetabular rim, a trait which may be diagnostic to caenagnathids (in which case Nomingia is a caenagnathid). Ojoraptorsaurus's fossa is further away from the acetabular rim than those of the other species, a feature characteristic to the genus. Among compared oviraptorosaurians, Ojoraptorsaurus is most similar to Epichirostenotes, a genus differentiated from Chirostenotes in the same paper that Ojoraptorsarus was described in. By comparing pubic proportions with those of CM 78001 (Anzu), Ojoraptorsaurus has been estimated to have been about 1.8 to 2.1 meters (5.9 to 6.9 feet) in length, about 20% smaller than Epichirostenotes. Ojoraptorsaurus differs from other caenagnathids due to possessing the following autapomorphies: * A ‚Äúspoon-shaped‚Äù depression on the anterior dorsal surface of the pubic boot. * An enclosed fossa on the inside edge of the pubis which lies 1 centimeter away from the acetabular rim. * The portion of the pubic shaft directly above the pubic boot being slightly anteriorly convex. * A sub-trapezoidal iliac peduncle articular surface of the pubis.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. It was later demolished in November 2016 and removed from the NRHP in 2020. Charles Sundberg Charles Sundberg was born on September 1, 1845, in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of Gustave and Elizabeth Sundberg. He emigrated to the United States in 1864, settling first in Marquette, Michigan, and in 1869 moving to Negaunee. In 1870, Sundberg began in business as a jeweler and a wine and liquor retailer. The next year he began a short-lived partnership with a fellow Swede, August A. Anderson, opening a branch store in nearby Ishpeming. The partnership was dissolved in 1873, with Anderson taking over the Ishpeming store and Sundberg continuing as a jeweler and watchmaker in Negaunee. However, in 1871 Sundberg married Anderson's daughter Mary. The couple had five children, three of whom died in childhood; the two remaining were Ida and Eva. Sundberg dropped his liquor business in 1878, but his jewellery business continued until his death on October 1, 1899. Building history In 1890, Sundberg purchased what was at the time the Jackson House hotel in Negaunee and tore it down. Sundberg hired John S. Mennie of Ishpeming to design a new three-story building on the site, and contractor E. E. Grip & Co., also from Ishpeming, to construct the building, which was completed in 1891. The building had three commercial spaces on the ground floor and office and apartment space above; the first three commercial tenants were Sundberg's own jewellery store, the A. T. Carmichael & Co. general store, and Katz Bros. dry goods. Tenants came and went over the years, with the building housing a series of dry goods stores, men's clothiers and other businesses including the local post office. Sundberg died in 1899, but his jewellery store continued in operation until 1908 when manager John F. Allison bought the remaining stock. The Sundberg heirs, however, still owned the building. Allison also owned a series of other stores located in the building, including a dry goods store and a pool hall. In 1907, Allison opened Negaunee's first movie theatre, the Electric, in the Sundberg block. The theatre closed soon after because of stiff competition, but a second theatre, the Bijou (later the Royal) opened later in 1907 and operated in the building until 1920. The Sundberg heirs continued to own the building until 1921, when the Negaunee Chamber of Commerce purchased it with the intention of refitting it as a manufacturing center to attract employers to the area. However, the building remained vacant until 1926, when Eisendrath Glove Company, a glove and mitten manufacturer, moved in. The company used the space until the mid-1930s, after which a series of garment and dress manufacturers used the building into the 1940s. Beginning 1936, parts of the Sundberg Block were used as a \\"Community Building\\", hosting various community groups and providing facilities for the local National Youth Administration. From the late 1950s until the early 1970s it held the Negaunee Youth Center, but by 1974 was again vacant. In the 1980s and 1990s, the building housed a furniture warehouse, but it was again vacant in the 2000s, used only for storage. Rapidly deteriorating building conditions resulted in the March 2010 collapse of a portion of the roof and west wall. The building was demolished in November 2016. Description Sundberg Block, 1912 The Sundberg Block was a two-story Late Victorian commercial building constructed of dark red brick with sandstone trim, with a slightly sloped flat roof. The building was rectangular in plan, measuring . Shallow piers divided the front facade into three bays, each defining a storefront. The central bay had a false front rising substantially above the flanking bays and is slightly wider, containing a separate door accessing the second-floor stairs. This center bay had a pair of square windows, above which was an inset stone carved with \\"1890 Sundberg Block\\". A series of five arch-top false windows ran along the upper section of the facade. The flanking bays had semi-round windows on the second floor, each divided in three vertically. Each bay was surmounted by an ornate cast iron cornice. The side walls were plain, with primarily two-over-two double-hung windows. Some of the original cast iron shutters were still in place. The rear was divided into three bays, corresponding to the divisions in the front. Each bay contained a center double-door entrance, with a single double-hung window to the side. The second story contained double-hung windows and several opening onto a wood-floor gallery, then considerably deteriorated before demolition.

Edward Enfield, 1863 photograph by Ferdinand Jean de la Fert√© Joubert. Life Enfield was the third son of Henry Enfield, town clerk of Nottingham, and grandson of William Enfield. He was born at Nottingham on 15 May 1811, where eldest brother, William, was a leader in philanthropic efforts. Edward entered Manchester College, York, as a literary student in 1826; he was contemporary with Samuel Bache and Sir Thomas Baker of Manchester. Through the influence of Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland he was appointed one of the moneyers of the Royal Mint. He was one of the most active members of the corporation, until, on the reorganisation of the Mint in 1851, he retired with a pension. From then on he gave his time to works of education and philanthropy. He was a member of the council and committee of management of University College, London (president of the senate from 1878), and of the council of University Hall, Gordon Square. From 1867 he acted as treasurer, and was the guiding spirit, of the University College Hospital; most of the sanitary and structural improvements in the hospital were under his supervision. As a Unitarian dissenter he took a large share in the conduct of the non-sectarian efforts for the elevation of the poor in East London, carried on by the Unitarian domestic mission society. In 1857 he was elected a trustee of the nonconformist endowments embraced in Dr. Daniel Williams's trust, and became a member of the estates and audit committees. At the time of his death he was president of Manchester New College, London. He died at his residence, 19 Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, on 21 April 1880, and was buried at Woking cemetery on 26 April.

It culminated in the Battle of Badajoz in August 1936, from which the troops of the Army of Africa under the command of Francisco Franco moved quickly to begin the march to Madrid. Background After the victory of the Popular Front in February 1936, the new government promised to start the land reform, but the agricultural unemployment was very high and the peasants started to illegally occupy large states. On 25 March 1936, 60,000 landless peasants in Badajoz led by the socialist's land union, the Federaci√≥n Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra or FNTT, took over 3,000 farms and started to plough. The government decided to legalise the land occupations. By June 1936, 190,000 landless peasants had been settled in the southern Spain. Many landowners left for the cities.Thomas, Hugh. (2001).

He designed over 100 churches, with several of them, along with other buildings, now listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Dielmann was born in San Antonio, Texas to John C. Dielmann, a German immigrant, and Maria (Gros) Dielmann, the daughter of immigrants. His father was a stonemason who joined a construction and supply business, Pauly and Dielmann. An active Catholic layman, he was elected the first president of the St. Joseph's Society of St. Joseph's R.C. Church and then served as first president of the Deutsch Roemisch Katholischer Staatsverband von Texas (the Catholic State League of Texas). Leo M.J. Dielmann graduated from St Mary's College in San Antonio in 1898. Afterwards he studied architecture and engineering in Germany from about 1899 to 1901, including a visit to the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris that showcased Art Nouveau in art and architecture. He returned to spend three years in his father's business, before setting up his own practice. Like his father, Dielmann was a leading Catholic layman, as a member of the St. Joseph's Society of St. Joseph's R.C. Church, the Knights of Columbus, Order of Alhambra, San Antonio Liederkranz, the Beethoven M√§nnerchor, and as president of the Harmonia Lodge of the Sons of Hermann. He also served as a city council member in San Antonio in 1913 and 1914, and was a long-time member of the San Antonio Public Library board of Trustees. In 1926, Deilmann completed Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church on San Antonio's West Side to serve its Mexican-American population. The red brick building is Romanesque, with strong elements of the Lombardy style. Dielmann's work included more than 100 church buildings from Houston to Marshall to Amarillo, but mostly across South Texas, as well as hundreds of commercial buildings, hotels, schools, and houses. His 12-story Frost Bank Building erected in 1922 was restored in 1994 to become the Municipal Plaza Building, housing the City Council chambers and city offices. Dielmann married Ella Marie Wagner, a daughter of German emigres, on April 25, 1911, and they had three children.

Background  At the end of July 1936, the Spanish rebel forces were in dire straits. The Republic held two-thirds of the country, the capital city, the gold reserves, the major urban centers and most of the industries. The main shock force of the rebels, the Spanish Army of Africa, was isolated in Spanish Morocco, the Republic held most of the Navy, and from 19 July, Spanish Republican Navy warships were patrolling the waters between Morocco and the mainland. With the assistance of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, the Nationalists managed to airlift their troops from Africa to Andalusia.Graham, Helen. (2005). The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction,. Oxford University Press. p.24  Airlift of troops  The Nationalists requested and received transport aircraft from Germany and Italy in order to transport their troops, establishing the first airlift of troops in history. Germany sent 20 Ju 52s and, between 29 July and 5 August, the Nationalists carried 1,500 men of the Spanish Army of Africa across the Strait by air, and another 15,000 between 5 and 15 August. Historian Hugh Thomas estimates 12,000 men were flown between August and September. Hitler stated: \\"Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers-52\\". This success was a major psychological blow (the news of the arrival of the Moors spread terror among the Republicans), but the Republican Navy still controlled the Straits and the Republican battleship threatened the transport aircraft with her heavy anti- aircraft fire.  Convoy  On 5 August, Franco decided to break the Republican naval blockade, with a convoy of merchant ships, carrying 2,500 to 3,000 soldiers,Preston, Paul. Franco. Harper Collins. London. 1994. p. 162. equipment and heavy weapons. The convoy departed from Ceuta and was made up of four transports escorted by the gunboat Dato, the coastguard ship Uad Kert and the old T-1 class torpedo boat T-19. The convoy was covered by five Savoia- Marchetti SM.81 bombers, three F.VIIs, one DC-2, two NiD.52 fighters, two Do Js, and a squadron of Breguet 19s. Three Republican destroyers were keeping a close watch on Spanish Morocco ports, but in the morning of 5 August the Nationalist aircraft launched air attacks against the Republican vessels in the Strait and the Republican destroyer was forced to leave Gibraltar by the British authorities.Preston, Paul. Franco. Harper Collins. London. 1994. p. 161. Because of this, only Alcal√° Galiano engaged the Nationalist ships. The convoy, bound for Algeciras, reached its destination on the evening after a brief exchange of fire. While mooring in Algeciras, the gunboat Dato straddled the British destroyer after misidentifying her as Republican.Moreno de Albor√°n y de Reyna, Fernando (1998) La guerra silenciosa y silenciada: Historia de la campa√±a naval durante la guerra de 1936‚Äì39. Gr√°ficas Lormo, p. 700\\\\. While steaming back to M√°laga, Alcal√° Galiano was attacked and hit by Nationalist aircraft. Francoist sources claim that she suffered 18 seamen killed and 28 wounded.Alpert, Michael (2008). La guerra civil espa√±ola en el mar. pp. 99‚Äì100.  Aftermath  From 6 August, transport ships crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, with the cover of Italian bombers. On 7 August, the battleship Jaime I and the cruiser Libertad shelled Algeciras and severely damaged Dato and Uad Kert. However, in the first week of August, a German Junkers Ju 52 struck the Republican Jaime I and Italian bombers started to harass the Republican fleet so that they could no longer prevent the passage of transport ships. Furthermore, the Republican warships were inefficiently handled by their crews and two German cruisers, and patrolled the Strait. In addition, the British authorities in Gibraltar and Tangier were hostile to the Republic. The British oil companies in Gibraltar refused to sell fuel to the Republican navy. The Tangier International Commission denied the use of the harbor to the Republican Navy, because this was contrary to the city's neutrality, but nevertheless authorized the passage of food, goods and gasoline for the German transport planes to Spanish Morocco. By the end of September, the Republic had lost control of the waters between Morocco and the mainland after the battle of Cape Espartel.KBismarck.org: \\"The Turning point at sea, 29 November 1936\\".

It was the first full tour with guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, who joined late in the previous year. Background Following the 1988 death of Hillel Slovak, departure of Jack Irons and firing of DeWayne McKnight and D.H. Peligro, Anthony Kiedis and Flea were finally able to find a lineup in late 1988 that worked for them and that would go on to create some of the band's biggest and best known albums over the next twenty years. With John Frusciante and Chad Smith on board, Mother's Milk instantly garnered more attention than the band's previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds. The band was now playing more arenas than ever before and gaining more television and radio exposure, especially through college radio, which was a huge supporter of the album and helped the band to eventually gain more mainstream attention. For the first time the band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. A VHS video documenting the tour titled Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven was released in 1990. Songs performed Tour overview The tour was by far the biggest tour for the band at the time breaking them through to new audiences and larger venues to perform at. The tour also included television appearances on such shows as The Arsenio Hall Show where they even performed a tribute to the late night host called \\"Ode To Arsenio\\" which was used as an intro to their cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\". In Austin, Texas,during the opening set by Mary's Danish, all four Chili Pepper's ran onstage totally naked, and tackled Mary's Danish two female lead singers. Out of the thirteen songs on the album, only \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\" has never been performed live however it was oddly placed on the band's 1992 What Hits!? album. \\"Show Me Your Soul\\", recorded in 1990 which would end up on the 1990 soundtrack for the film, Pretty Woman got a one time only lip-synch performance although it has never been performed live. The band also performed \\"Naked in the Rain\\" for the first time ever near the tour's end. The song would appear on their next album, 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik. In July 2017 Chad Smith told in fan interview that actually many songs from the first three records were performed during the tour and some of them were played only one time. He also mentioned that the song \\"Jungle Man\\" was also played during this tour. This tour marked the last time \\"American Ghost Dance\\", \\"Baby Appeal\\", \\"Good Time Boys\\", \\"Knock Me Down\\", \\"Punk Rock Classic\\", \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\", \\"Jungle Man\\", \\"Taste the Pain\\" and \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" were performed live.http://rhcplivearchive.com/discography Opening acts *The Black Crowes *Buckpets *Camper van Beethoven *Cosmic Wurst *The Cramps *David St. Hubbins (introduced the band at June 16, 1990 show) *The Dead Milkmen *Exodushttp://www.metallipromo.com/ex.html *Faith No More * Fishbone *Mary's Danish *Meat Puppets *Murphy's Law *Original Sins *Pocket Fishermen *Primus *Raging Slab (December 1, 1989 Atlanta, GA, December 2, 1989 Charlotte, NC) *The Reyond *The Side Wingers *Sprawl *Suicidal Tendencies *Too Free Stooges *The Weirdos *Young Fresh Fellows Personnel *Flea - bass, backing vocals *John Frusciante - guitar, backing vocals *Anthony Kiedis - lead vocals *Chad Smith - drums Additional musicians *Keith \\"Tree\\" Barry - saxophone/horns, backing vocals *Kristen Vigard - backing vocals *Vickie Calhoun - backing vocals *Robbie Allen (aka Rob Rule) - opening comedy act, roadie References External links *Red Hot Chili Peppers website *The Side: Red Hot Chili Peppers Touring History Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers concert tours Category:1989 concert tours Category:1990 concert tours ","title":"Mother's Milk Tour"},{"id":"32532354","text":"Bulun () is a rural locality (a selo), the only inhabited locality, and the administrative center of Aldansky Rural Okrug of Tattinsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located from Ytyk-Kyuyol, the administrative center of the district.

She became a paraplegic at age 7 due to a car accident. She began competing in wheelchair racing in 1994, and first represented Australia in 1998. Over four Paralympic Games from 2000 to 2012, she has won three silver and two bronze medals. Her current coach is Louise Sauvage and her training partner is Madison de Rozario. Ballard held athletics scholarships at the Australian Institute of Sport from 1999 to 2001, and The University of Sydney (while studying first commerce and then psychology), and also represents the New South Wales Institute of Sport. She has been appointed by a number of organisations as a disability or sports ambassador, and currently sits on the board of Wheelchair Sports NSW. She represented Australia at the 2016 Rio Paralympics. It was her fifth Games. Personal Ballard was born on 6 June 1982 in Canberra. At the age of seven, she became a (T10) paraplegic after a car accident, when her mother lost control of the car through fatigue. Following the accident, her initial hospitalisation and rehabilitation was in Canberra for three months, among elderly amputees. Her rehabilitation was then moved to the Royal North Shore Hospital, where she met Christie Dawes (n√©e Skelton), who she would later race with in the Australian 4x100 m relay team at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. Because her brother had spina bifida, and was already \\"in the [regular] system\\", her parents insisted that Angie continue at a regular school, rather than one specifically for disabled students. She attended Lyneham Primary School and Lyneham High School in Canberra. Her physical education teacher was one of the people who first encouraged her to participate in wheelchair sports. After her rehabilitation she tried swimming and wheelchair basketball. Her first experiences of racing at the age of 12 resulted in blisters and a sore neck, but wheelchair athletics soon became her passion. At age 14, after treatment for scoliosis, Ballard was unable to participate in sport for a year. She was offered a scholarship with the ACT Academy of Sport and she then took up an athletics scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, she moved to Sydney to attend university on a sports scholarship, initially studying commerce. , she was living in Liberty Grove, New South Wales and attending the University of Sydney studying for a Bachelor of Psychology, with the intention of practising as a psychologist. She graduated and received an Alumni Award in 2014. Athletics Ballard is a wheelchair racing athlete, competing mainly in category T53 sprint events. Compared to T54 athletes, she has less use of her abdominal muscles, which means she cannot raise herself as much in her wheelchair to get the best angle to propel herself forward. Ballard first entered competitive wheelchair races in 1994, at the age of twelve. Her first racing wheelchair was bought second hand. By 1997, she started taking the sport more seriously and began setting records in Australian athletics for her classification. A year later she was representing her country on the international stage. By 2000, she held national records in the T53 100 m and 200 m events. From 2002 she held a sports scholarship at the University of Sydney, where she was coached by Andrew Dawes (Christie's husband). At the time, Dawes also coached Louise Sauvage, and on occasion the two would train together. After Sauvage retired from competitive wheelchair athletics following the 2004 Games, she became Ballard's coach. her training partner is Madison de Rozario. Paralympics Ballard at the 2012 London Paralympics Ballard competed in Sydney in the 2000 Summer Paralympics but did not win any medals,, retrieved 4 March 2012. placing fourth in both the 100 m and 200 m events; she was also a torch bearer, and featured in the entertainment section of the opening ceremony, where she circled the track in the air, suspended by a blimp and giant inflated angels. In preparation for the 2004 Athens Paralympics, Ballard trained six days a week in 11 sessions. Her training included going to Centennial Park and training on the hills there. It also included track work twice a week and doing weight training at least three times a week. This training schedule caused a few injuries, so she reduced the training frequency for later Games. Louise Sauvage (left) and Ballard at the 2012 Australian Paralympian of the Year awards ceremony Just before the Games, she competed in a warm up event in Switzerland, and set Australian records in the 100 m, 400 m and 800 m events. At the 2004 games, she won a bronze medal in the T53 100 m, behind Tanni Grey-Thompson and Francesca Porcellato. Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a personal best, but she also had eyes on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her teammates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100 m relay.

I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that the worst thing that can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, but the reality is that this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I‚Äôve just worked so hard for this for so long.\\" She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800 mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.

Dr. Robert Hovenden in the All Souls College Chapel at Oxford. Robert Hovenden D.D. (1544‚Äì1614) was an English academic administrator at the University of Oxford. Hovenden was elected Warden (head) of All Souls College, Oxford in 1571, a post he held until 1614. During his time as Warden of All Souls College, he was also Vice-Chancellorof Oxford University during 1582‚Äì3. Hovenden was a humanist, undertook building work for All Souls College, and produced strip maps of the College estates. Life He was the eldest son of William Hoveden or Hovenden of Canterbury. He was educated at the University of Oxford, was elected a Fellow of All Souls' College in 1565, and graduated BA in the following year, and MA in 1570. He became chaplain to Archbishop Matthew Parker, and in 1570 or 1571 held the prebend of Clifton in Lincoln Cathedral. On 12 November 1571, Hovenden succeeded Richard Barber as Warden of the college. In 1575 he supplicated for the degree of BD, but proceeded no further until 1580, when he performed all the exercises for the degrees of B.D. and DD, making the pretensions of the Pope the subject of his disputations. He was licensed as D.D. in 1581. In 1582, he filled the office of Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. In 1581 he was holding, with his wardenship, the prebend of Henstridge in Wells Cathedral, and in 1589 the third prebend in Canterbury Cathedral. Hovenden entered on his duties as Warden of All Souls while the college was striving to preserve its Catholic 'monuments of superstition' in the chapel from demolition, but in December 1573 the orders of the commissioners in the matter were too stringent to be any longer disobeyed. Hovenden exerted himself, however, to secure the profitable management of the college estates. He caused to be made a series of maps of the collegiate property which are still in existence. He successfully resisted the request of Queen Elizabeth that the college should grant a lease of certain lands to Lady Stafford on terms which would have been disadvantageous to the college, although the lady herself offered the warden ¬£100. Hovenden succeeded in recovering for the college the rectory of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, which had been granted to it by Cardinal Pole, but resumed by the crown on the accession of Elizabeth. He completed the Warden's lodgings, which had been begun about fifteen years before; enlarged the grounds of the college by adding the site of a house known as 'The Rose,' where there was a famous well; rearranged the old library, now disused, and converted into rooms; introduced a better system of keeping the college books and accounts; and put in order and catalogued the archives. Hovenden rigorously upheld his authority within the college. With the aid of the visitor, Archbishop Edmund Grindal, he compelled Fellows who desired to practise law or medicine in London to vacate their fellowships: his contest with Henry Wood, one of the Fellows, was related by John Strype. He carefully scrutinised claims to fellowships on the plea of founder's kin. The main alteration which he made in the constitution of the college was the admission of poor scholars (servientes), who in 1612 numbered thirty-one, but they were discontinued during the Commonwealth, and were later represented only by four bible clerks. Hovenden died on 25 March 1614, and was buried in the college chapel, where there is his monument with an inscription. There was a bust of Hovenden in the Codrington Library at All Souls, executed by Sir Henry Cheere. Works Hovenden wrote a life of Archbishop Chichele, the founder of All Souls', which was used by Sir Arthur Duck in his life of the archbishop (1617); and a catalogue of the wardens and fellows of the college. Family Hovenden married Katherine, eldest daughter of Thomas Powys of Abingdon, and is doubtfully said to have had a daughter, Elizabeth, wife of Edward Chaloner, second son of Sir Thomas Chaloner of Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire. He had two younger brothers. Christopher (1559‚Äì1610) was a Fellow of All Souls College (1575‚Äì81), member of the Middle Temple, and Rector of Stanton Harcourt (by presentation of All Souls). He was buried at Stanton Harcourt in 1610, having married Margery Powys, sister of the Warden's wife. The warden erected a monument over his grave. The second brother, George (1562‚Äì1625), was Rector of Harrietsham, Kent, a living also in the gift of All Souls, and held the tenth prebend in Canterbury Cathedral from 15 December 1609 till his death at Oxford 24 October 1625. Both brothers secured beneficial leases of college property.

He also had success as a shot putter. College career 2008 Ta'amu played in all 12 games as a true freshman with five starts in 2008. One of 12 true freshman to see playing time, Ta'amu made a season high six tackles versus UCLA. He finished the season with 21 tackles.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/players/alameda-taamu-1.html 2009 As a sophomore in 2009, Ta'amu again played in all 12 games, and he had 11 starts. He had a season high five tackles at Arizona State. He finished the season with 19 tackles, 4.5 for loss, and 2.5 sacks. 2010 In 2010, Ta'amu started all 13 games at defensive tackle in what would be his breakout season. He was a key factor in getting the Huskies back to a bowl game, with a season high seven tackles at Oregon and matched that total versus UCLA. During the 2010 Holiday Bowl, he had a 10-yard sack and 14-yard fumble return. Ta'amu finished the season with 39 tackles, 5 for loss, and 1.5 sacks and earned honorable mention All-Pac-10 honors. 2011 As a senior in 2011, Ta'amu started all 13 games at defensive tackle and was named a team captain prior to the start of the season. In the Apple Cup rivalry game against Washington State, Ta'amu had four tackles, with 2.5 for loss that included two sacks. Ta'amu ended his senior season as an all-Pac-12 honorable mention selection. For the season, Ta'amu had 30 tackles, including 3.5 sacks out of 7.0 total tackles for loss. Professional career 2012 NFL Draft Regarded as one of the few two- gap nose tackles, Ta'amu was projected as a third-to-fourth round draft pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. Dane Brugler of CBSSports.com, however, described Ta'amu as \\"a pass rushing three-technique stuck in a zero-technique's body,\\" who \\"struggles to hold his ground at the point of attack\\". The Pittsburgh Steelers nevertheless traded its number 6 pick to move up 10 spots in the fourth round to select Ta'amu with the 109th pick of the 2012 NFL Draft. Pittsburgh Steelers On November 12, 2012, Ta'amu was waived by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was re-signed on November 15, 2012. During the season, he was inactive for seven games and spent six games on the practice squad. Arizona Cardinals After Ta'amu failed to make the Steelers' 53-man roster, the Arizona Cardinals claimed him off waivers on August 31, 2013. In the 2013 season, Ta'amu played in 14 games and had six tackles. In 2014, Ta'amu played in seven games and recorded no statistics. On September 5, 2015, he was released by the Cardinals. Kansas City Chiefs On January 5, 2016, Ta'Amu signed a futures contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was cut on August 5, 2016. Buffalo Bills Ta'Amu was signed by the Bills. On August 30, 2016, he was released by the Bills. He participated in The Spring League in 2017. Personal life Criminal proceedings In October 2011 Ta'amu was charged with driving under the influence for an incident that occurred December 12, 2009, while he was playing for the University of Washington. The police report stated that Ta'amu was stopped for driving 73 mph in a 60 mph zone at 3:40 a.m. and that he \\"smelled [of] an odor of alcohol\\" and had \\"blood-shot watery eyes.\\" Police said Ta'amu, who was 19 at the time, registered 0.097 and 0.098 on breath tests. Ta'amu pleaded guilty to negligent driving, for which he was sentenced to one day in a community-work program and ordered to pay a $350 fine. On October 14, 2012, Ta'amu was arrested after he allegedly evaded police while driving intoxicated and struck several parked cars, injuring one person in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. During the chase, before he was apprehended, Ta'amu allegedly shed his shirt in an attempt to evade arrest, claiming he was not the driver of the erratic SUV. As a result of the incident the team suspended Ta'amu for two weeks without pay (from October 16‚Äì29, 2012). On April 4, 2013, Ta'amu pleaded guilty to three counts of recklessly endangering another person, resisting arrest and driving under the influence. Charges of aggravated assault were withdrawn by prosecutors. The trial judge found him not guilty of fleeing and eluding arrest because the officer chasing him along East Carson Street was in an unmarked car. Ta'amu was sentenced to serve 18 months probation, four days in a DUI housing program and 150 hours of community service.

He was a cabinet member in the first A. K. Fazlul Huq ministry and later the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in the second coalition Ministry. He was renowned for his advocacy of abolition of British imperialism and for his support of Hindu-Muslim cooperation in the form of an undivided India.  Early life  Syed Nausher Ali was born in Jessore in 1891 in an affluent family. He had his early education in Khulna and later moved to Calcutta for his higher education and obtained his bachelor's degree and law degree from Calcutta University. He joined the Calcutta High Court Bar in 1921. Ali was elected as a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1921 and in 1936 he joined the Krishak Praja Party (KPP). In 1937, when Fazlul Huq formed a coalition government with the All-India Muslim League, Nausher Ali was the only other KPP representative in the joint cabinet. He served as the Minister of the Health Department and was also responsible for the Local Self- Government Department. During his tenure as a minister, Nausher Ali came under the spotlight for appointing Muslim candidates in the open posts. This led to internal political tensions among the members of the joint-cabinet and as a result when the government was reconstituted after 1938, Ali was left out of the cabinet. In 1939, Ali formally joined the Congress. To assist Congress' campaign, Ali organised meetings with peasants in the districts of Khulna and Jessore, attacking the zamindars and supporters of British imperialism and organizing means to empower peasants by encouraging them not to pay rent to the government. In 1942 when Fazlul Huq formed the second coalition Ministry, Syed Nausher Ali became the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1 March 1943 to 14 May 1946.  Later life  In the 1940s, Muslim opinion in Bengal turned in favour of a Pakistan independent of India. Syed Nausher Ali, however, continued to voice his support for the unity of India. During the election of 1945‚Äì46 he was one of the only two Muslim candidates from the Indian National Congress in Bengal. After 1947 he decided to stay in India and became a prominent Muslim politician in West Bengal. He died on 6 April 1972.

It is one of the constituent counties of Munster GAA. Cork is one of the few 'dual counties' in Ireland, competing in a similar level in both football and hurling. As of the end of the 2015 National Leagues, Cork compete in the top division of both sports. However, despite both teams competing at the top level of the game for most of the county's history, the hurling team has experienced more success, winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 30 times. By comparison, Cork has only won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship seven times. Traditionally football is strongest in the western half of the county, with the O'Donovan Rossa club of Skibbereen the only Cork team from outside the city to have an All-Ireland Club Football title. Hurling is the dominant sport in the east, with teams such as Sarsfields and Midleton having won Cork's club championship multiple times. Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb, with hurling pockets in football areas and vice versa. One example is Fermoy in east Cork, which has seven Cork football titles to its name. The city of Cork traditionally has strong teams in both sports, with Nemo Rangers being the record-holders for All-Ireland Club Football Championships won, and Blackrock having three All-Ireland Club Hurling titles. As well as this, the St Finbarr's club in the city has eight Cork football titles and 25 in hurling. Colours and symbols Cork city coat of arms Cork's current GAA crest is based on the traditional coat of arms of Cork city. Like the coat of arms, the crest features the King's old castle and the Queen's old castle with the Shandon Steeple in between. The centre foreground of the crest features a ship, as does the coat of arms. This is due to Cork's history as a port city, also shown in the city motto \\"Statio Bene Fida Carinis\\", which translates to \\"A safe harbour for ships\\". The badge also features two footballs, along with a crossed pair of hurleys. Cork's traditional colours are red and white, but this was not always the case. In its early days of competing, the county wore a blue jersey with a saffron-coloured 'C' emblazoned on the chest. This was changed in 1919 when the Cork hurlers were preparing to play Dublin in the All-Ireland Final. In the week leading up to the game, British forces broke into the county board offices on Maylor Street in the city centre and seized the Cork jerseys. Because of the loss of their kit, the county board borrowed jerseys from the now-defunct Father O'Leary Temperance Association team. Cork went on to win the game, ending a sixteen-year spell without a trophy. Following this win Cork decided to wear the 'lucky' red jerseys in their future games. This red and white colour scheme has led to the Cork strip being nicknamed the blood and bandage. A colour clash with Louth in the 1957 All- Ireland Football Final saw Cork wear the blue jerseys again, but this occasion saw the team wear the blue jersey of the province of Munster. In 1976 Cork's footballers became involved in an incident known as 'the three stripes affair'. Before the Munster football final Cork were offered a set of Adidas jerseys. The use of these jerseys caused controversy as it seemed to undermine the promotion of Irish manufacturers. Cork's alternative colours are traditionally white jerseys and white shorts. These alternate colours were worn in the 1973 All-Ireland Football Final when Cork defeated Galway to claim their fourth title. They were worn again in the 2010 Final when Cork defeated Down for their seventh title. Since then, Cork have generally worn their traditional red jerseys on all occasions. Football Clubs The city of Cork's clubs Nemo Rangers are the record-holders for All-Ireland Club Football Championships won, while the St Finbarr's club in the city have eight Cork football titles. County team Football has always been seen as the weaker of the two sports in Cork. The game is strongest in the west of the county and in Cork city. Success, especially at senior level, has been much more sporadic that with hurling. The biggest hindrance to success has been the presence of next-door neighbours Kerry. Cork has been the second strongest county in Munster since the 1940s and often one of the best in the country. Many very good Cork teams were unable to overcome Kerry when they met in the Munster final. Cork began the 1970s with three Munster titles in 4 years and the 1973 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. But they then ran up against the great Kerry team of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, the two teams drew in the final of the Munster Senior Football Championship. The replay went to extra- time before two very controversial refereeing decisions saw Kerry victorious. Cork fell back after that for a number of years. In 1983 Kerry was aiming to capture a record ninth consecutive Munster title; however, Cork pulled off one of their surprise victories. Kerry, however, won the next three Munster and All-Ireland titles. In 1987 Billy Morgan was back with Cork, this time as manager. That year Cork reclaimed the Munster Championship crown from the Kingdom. It was the first of four Munster titles in-a-row. They reached the All-Ireland final that year only to be defeated by Meath. In 1988 Cork were defeated by Meath for the second consecutive year after a replay. Having lost the previous two All-Ireland finals Cork were even hungrier for achievement in 1989. That year they captured the National Football League before facing Mayo in the championship decider. The game ended in victory for Cork who claimed their fifth-ever All-Ireland title. In 1990 Cork squared up to Meath in the All-Ireland final for the third time in four years. In a close game, Cork emerged victorious by two points to claim a second consecutive championship. Cork surrendered their provincial title for the next two years; however, they reclaimed it in 1993. That year they reached another All-Ireland final; however, it was Derry who won their first All-Ireland title on that occasion. Cork won the next two Munster titles as well, however, they were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final on both those occasions. The defeat in 1995 brought an end to one of Cork's greatest-ever periods in football history. Four years later in 1999 Cork won the Munster title for the fifth time of the decade. They later faced old rivals, Meath, in the All-Ireland final; however, victory went to the Leinster men on that occasion. While it was expected that the team would build on the success of 1999, Cork went into decline as Kerry began to dominate in Munster. In 2002 Cork triumphed again and captured the Munster title after a victory over Tipperary in a replay. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Cork take on Kerry. It was a historic occasion as it was the first time that the two sides had met in Croke Park. Unfortunately, Cork was trounced on a scoreline of 3‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì7. The year ended with the Cork hurling team going on strike. In turn, the football team joined in a sympathy strike. The players, who had been seeking better conditions, refused to play or train with the county again until the dispute with the county board was resolved. The player's demands included having their own doctor at all Championship and League games, resolving disputes over travel arrangements and providing players with free gymnasium access. The strike was eventually resolved and all the demands were met. Following the strike, the fortunes of the Cork football team took a turn for the worse. A series of defeats in 2003 and 2004 saw the Cork football team almost at an all-time low. In 2005 Cork narrowly lost the Munster final but qualified for the All-Ireland semi-final where Kerry was again waiting. The scoreline of 1‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì9 in favour of the men from the Kingdom tells its own story. In 2006 Cork won their first Munster title in four years following a defeat of Kerry. The two sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final; however, in a similar pattern Kerry was victorious. In 2007 Cork lost their Munster crown to Kerry; however, they made use of the qualifiers and found themselves in the All-Ireland final. Kerry, the old rivals, provided the opposition in the first all-Munster All- Ireland final. The game started on a level pegging; however, Kerry ran riot and captured the title with a 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 victory. It was one of Cork's most humiliating defeats. The Cork senior footballers and hurlers withdrew their services for almost 100 days from November 2007 until February 2008. For more on this see 2007‚Äì08 Cork players' strike. In spite of this, Cork reached the All-Ireland semi-final where they lost to old rivals Kerry after a replay. Cork retained their Munster crown in 2009. The team advanced to the All- Ireland Final, overcoming 2008 champions Tyrone along the way, to meet Kerry in the final. Cork lost on a scoreline of 1‚Äì9 to 16 points for Kerry. In April 2010, Cork won the National Football League Division 1 title with a 1‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì12 win against Mayo at Croke Park in front of a crowd of 27,005. On 19 September 2010, Cork won the All Ireland football title beating Down 0‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì15 in Croke Park. In April 2011, Cork retained the National Football League after a 0‚Äì21 to 2‚Äì14 win against Dublin. Hurling Clubs The city of Cork's clubs Blackrock have won three All-Ireland Club Hurling titles, while the St Finbarr's club in the city has 25 Cork hurling titles. History Early years In the early days Cork had been one of the few teams that was interested in fielding a hurling team in the first All-Ireland championship in 1887, however, a dispute over which team should represent the county led to Cork not taking part at all. The county entered a team in 1888 and went on to win their first All-Ireland title in 1890 when Aughabullogue beat Castlebridge of Wexford. In the early years of the competition the various county champions represented their county in the All-Ireland series, however, all this changed in 1892 when Cork contested, and won, their second All-Ireland final with a team consisting of the best players from the various clubs all over the county. Further All-Ireland titles in 1893 and 1894 meant Cork became the first team to win the coveted three-in-row. This record would stand until it was later equalled by Kilkenny and Tipperary. Between 1901 and 1905 Cork appeared in five successive All-Ireland finals, however, victory only came in the form of a two-in-a-row in 1902 and 1903. Following this Cork's hurlers faced a barren spell of sixteen years until their next All- Ireland win in 1919. A further five All-Ireland finals were contested by Cork between 1926 and 1931 with victory coming on four occasions. Cork's Greatest ever team? By one important measure the Cork team of the 1940s is regarded as one of the two greatest teams of all-time. They are one of only two teams to win four All-Ireland hurling titles in-a-row (the other being the Kilkenny team of 2006 to 2009). In 1941 an optimistic Cork were buoyed up for an All-Ireland victory that had eluded them since 1931 (Cork had been beaten in the 1939 final). A bizarre turn of events, however, would eventually allow Cork to be declared champions but would also cast doubt over the value of their victory. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the midlands forced Tipperary and Kilkenny to withdraw from the competition. As a result, Cork faced Limerick in the Munster final, and defeated them, before hammering Dublin in the All-Ireland decider for one of the handiest championships ever won. Following the All-Ireland final Cork played Tipperary in the delayed Munster final and lost, thus becoming the very first All-Ireland champions but provincial runners-up. For these reasons Cork's first win of four in-a-row is often dismissed by their opponents. In 1942 Jim Barry and his Cork team set out to prove that their victory had not been a fluke caused by outside events. They defeated Tipperary in the Munster final and silenced their critics, before going on to claim their second consecutive All-Ireland title by defeating Dublin again. In 1943 Cork were again Munster champions and qualified for the All-Ireland final where their opponents were expected to be Kilkenny. The \\"cats\\", however, were surprisingly defeated by Antrim, a junior team, in the All-Ireland semi-final. Cork went on to record a comprehensive victory over the Ulstermen in the final and claim a third consecutive All- Ireland victory. In 1944 Cork were again Munster champions, defeating Mick Mackey's Limerick side in the decider. They just about prevented an upset in the All-Ireland semi-final, squeezing past Galway before walloping their old enemy Dublin in the final. Cork were on their best form in that final, and set a record of four All-Ireland titles in-a-row that has never been equalled. Five consecutive All-Ireland titles were beyond this Cork team as they were defeated in the 1945 Munster final. They returned in 1946, however, winning back their Munster crown and defeating Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. It was one of the great one-man shows by Christy Ring who, at the age of 25, collected his fifth All-Ireland winner medal. The story of this Cork team's success was bookended by defeat the classic 1947 All-Ireland final. This match has come to be known as the \\"thunder and lightning final.\\" On the day before World War II broke out, Cork faced a Kilkenny side who were playing in their fourth final in five years. The game was played at a frantic pace with both sides remaining level for much of the game. Just as the game reached its climax a crack of thunder interrupted the play and the rain bucketed down. After a tense battle Kilkenny emerged victorious by a solitary point. This defeat brought an end to the unprecedented run of success of the Cork team of the 1940s. The 1950s Between 1949 and 1951 Cork had met Tipperary every year in the Munster final. Each year Tipp had won and went on to claim the All-Ireland title. By 1952 Cork had an extra motivating factor because they realised that if Tipperary beat them again, they would almost certainly win a fourth consecutive All-Ireland title and equal the record set by Cork in the 1940s. At the start of the 1952 championship Tipp were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland crown. It looked like the same old story in the Munster final as Cork conceded a goal after just three minutes of play. A goal for Cork from Mossie O'Riordan was the turning point of the match, however, and Cork ended Tipp's hopes of four in-a-row with a scoreline of 1‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì7. Christy Ring, who had again proved instrumental in the victory, was shouldered off the field with blood streaming down his face and a bandage around his head. Cork went on to narrowly defeat Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final before hammering Dublin in the final. In 1953 Cork set out to defend their title. They defeated their old rivals Tipperary in the Munster final and set up a meeting with Galway in the All-Ireland decider. The game would go down in history as the dirtiest All-Ireland final ever played. Galway believed that the physical route was the best way to upset Cork and it did. In a low scoring game Cork won by a single point, however, the battle didn't stop at Croke Park. Later that night some of the Galway players arrived at the Gresham Hotel where Cork were staying. A fight broke, with Christy Ring getting a punch in the face and falling down some steps. The melee ended just as quick as it had begun. In 1954 Cork were the favourites to complete another three in-a-row. They defeated Tipp again in the Munster final, before storming past Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. The Corkmen then advanced to play Wexford in one of the most eagerly anticipated All-Ireland finals ever. Wexford were hotly tipped to spoil Cork's quest for another treble, however, on the day Cork's defence were on top form. They won on a scoreline of 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6, with Christy Ring becoming the first player to win eight All-Ireland medals. In 1955 Cork were beaten by Clare in the opening round of the Munster championship, however, they returned for one final swansong in 1956. They regained their Munster crown, courtesy of a hat-trick by Christy Ring, and set up another All-Ireland final showdown with Wexford. It was another classic encounter but sides at their peak. The turing point of the game came when Wexford were two points up. Their goalkeeper, Art Foley, saved a great shot by Christy Ring and cleared the ball. Within seconds Nicky Rackard scored a goal to win the game for Wexford. The final score was 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8. Ring had been denied his ninth All-Ireland medal. In a show of solidarity Bobby Rackard and Nick O'Donnell of Wexford shouldered Ring off the field. It would be Cork's last All-Ireland final appearance for ten years. Another three-in-a-row The Cork hurling team that captured a third All-Ireland title in-a-row in 1978. In 1966 Cork came from nowhere to win their first Munster title in a decade and advanced to an All-Ireland final decider against Kilkenny. None of the Cork team had ever played in Croke Park before, however, for Kilkenny it was like their home stadium. There was even speculation that Christy Ring, the age of 45, was about to come out of retirement to play for Cork, however, this didn't happen. While Kilkenny were the favourites Gerald McCarthy captained one of the youngest Cork teams ever to victory. Kilkenny had their revenge over Cork in 1969, however, in 1970 Cork captured the Liam MacCarthy Cup with a massive win over Wexford. The 1970s was to be a glorious decade for Cork's hurlers. In 1975 Cork won their first Munster title since 1972. It was to be the first of five Munster Championship victories in-a-row. An All-Ireland semi-final loss to Galway raised certain doubts over Cork's ability. They silenced their critics in 1976 when Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final. After 8 minutes Cork were in severe trouble, having conceded two goals and two points. It looked as if the game was going to be a repeat of the 1956 final, however, Cork fought back to win what has been referred to as Pat Moylan's All-Ireland final. In 1977 Cork were back in the All-Ireland final taking on Wexford for the second consecutive year. The game didn't start as quickly as the previous year, however, it was no less as exciting. Cork's captain, Martin O'Doherty, and the team's goalkeeper, Martin Coleman, were the heroes of the day, as Cork won on a scoreline of 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8. The three-in-a-row was the major talking- point yet again and Cork didn't disappoint, making it to the All-Ireland final again. This time their opponents were Kilkenny. They gave Cork a fright when they scored an early goal, however, an opportunistic goal by Cork's Jimmy Barry-Murphy sealed victory for the Leesiders. Sporting history was made. The possibility of completing a famous four-in-a-row looked extremely likely in 1979 when Cork captured their fifth Munster title. A defeat at the All-Ireland semi-final stage by Galway ended Cork's run of success, and brought an end to the careers of many of their most famous players. 1980s and 1990s After little success in the early 1980s Cork reclaimed their Munster Championship crown in 1982. It was the first of five Munster titles in-a-row. They reached the All-Ireland final that year only to be defeated by Kilkenny. In 1983 Cork were defeated by \\"the cats\\" for the second consecutive year. 1984 was a special year for Gaelic games as it was the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Having lost the previous two All-Ireland finals Cork were even hungrier for success in 1984. The plan nearly came unstuck in the Munster final when Tipperary were up by four points with four minutes to go. Two goals from Se√°nie O'Leary and Tony O'Sullivan sealed victory for \\"the Rebels\\" and they advanced to an easy win over Offaly in the All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium. In 1986 Cork were back in the All-Ireland final, this time facing hot favourites Galway. Cork scored four goals on that day and, in spite of a late goal by Galway's P.J. Molloy, Cork won the day on a scoreline of 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15. Four years later in 1990 Cork were Munster champions again before taking part in another final against Galway. Again Cork were the underdogs coming into the final. In one of the most high-scoring finals in years Cork emerged victorious again with a scoreline of 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21. The 1990s which started so well were to prove difficult for the Cork hurlers. After losing to Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final in 1992 it would take until 1999 for Cork to re-emerge as Munster and All-Ireland champions. Jimmy Barry- Murphy, who had given so much service as a player, masterminded the youngest Cork team ever to another All-Ireland victory. 1999‚Äìpresent While it was expected that the team would build on the success of 1999 the exact opposite happened. After a defeat to Offaly in the All-Ireland semi-final in 2000 the team went into terminal decline. In 2002 the entire senior hurling panel took the unprecedented move of going on strike. The players, who had been seeking better conditions, refused to play or train with the county again until the dispute with the county board was resolved. The players demands included having their own doctor at all Championship, League, resolving disputes over travel arrangements and providing players with free gymnasium access. The strike was eventually resolved and all the demands were met, but not before the Cork footballers also went on strike in sympathy. Following the strike the Cork hurlers came back stronger than ever, winning three out of the next four Munster championships. Cork became the best team in the country reaching four consecutive All-Ireland finals with victories coming in 2004 and 2005. In 2006 Cork attempted to capture an elusive three-in-a-row, however, they were defeated by Kilkenny.

Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War, Latin American Perspectives Vol.33, pg. 28-50. History The leagues were founded by Brazilian communists, who believed that the latifundia, which had always dominated the Brazilian economy, were in a semicolonial relationship with the United States and were conspiring to oppress the working class by forcing rural workers to produce cash crops instead of food for native consumption and refusing to develop land which could not support those crops,Welch, Cliff.

Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War, Latin American Perspectives Vol.33, pg. 30. When the PCB began struggling with political pressure in the late 1950s Francisco Juli√£o began taking on the business of establishing and organizing leagues. In January 1955, Francisco Juli√£o made one of the most important associations legal, the SAPPP, that used to fight for peasants rights before its legalization. Communists objected to his growing role in the movement. His attempts to unify the leagues and resistance to registering them as unions conflicted with their own goal of attaining legitimacy, and his use of violent revolutionary rhetoric made them worry about retaliation from the military and police.Forman, Shepard. Disunity and Discontent: A Study of Peasant Political Movements in Brazil, Journal of Latin American Studies Vol.3, pp.14-16. Reaction The populist Brazilian government's attitude towards the leagues varied over time from neutral to positive, while that of the military and police was uniformly negative. The armed forces in the Brazilian Northeast had many connections to wealthy landowners whose enterprises were threatened by the activities of the leagues, and they would go to extraordinary lengths to curtail league activity.Current Intelligence Weekly Summary 1 June 1962 pg.7 The Catholic Church established organizations in the Northeast which functioned similarly but were conservative and anti-communist in their outlook; these groups were crushed alongside the peasant leagues following the 1964 coup.Wiarda, I√™da S. and Wiarda, Howard J.

He was a British agent during the American Revolutionary War. George Washington had him hanged for his involvement in a plot to destroy the American economy by placing counterfeit money into circulation. American Revolution Farnsworth initially joined up with Patriot forces in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the age of 15 in 1775, serving as a drummer and participating in the Battle of Bunker Hill.Saunderson, Rev. Henry H. History of Charlestown, NH - Fort No. 4, 1876, page 358 The use of counterfeit money has been used as a strategy in warfare for centuries. The idea is to flood the enemy's economy with fake money, thus devaluing the real money and causing an economic collapse, rendering the enemy unable to fund their side of the war. During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress decided to create a new Continental currency to fund the war. Among the people enlisted to print this new currency was Paul Revere. To counter this, Great Britain enlisted teams of counterfeiters to travel throughout the American Colonies, placing their counterfeits into circulation in the hopes that it would cause an economic disaster. These counterfeiters were known as \\"shovers,\\" presumably for their ability to \\"shove\\" the fake money into everyday use. David Farnsworth and his partner John Blair were among the best-known of these counterfeiters, having been caught with over $10,000 in fake Continental dollars in their possession. On October 8, 1778 in a court-martial held in Danbury by order of General Horatio Gates and Brigadier General John Paterson, Farnsworth and Blair were tried for, and convicted of, \\"being found about the Encampment of the Armies of The United- States as Spies and having a large sum of counterfeit Money about them which they brought from New-York\\". The sentence of execution was prescribed by a two-thirds vote. On October 23 in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Commander in Chief George Washington approved of the sentence and ordered their immediate execution upon their arrival at General Gates' division.General Orders, 23 October 1778. Founders Online National Archives https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-17-02-0549. Accessed May 20, 2016. Farnsworth and Blair were executed in Rocky Hill, Connecticut in Hartford County, Connecticut on November 3, 1778. In popular culture In fiction, Farnsworth appeared in the Futurama episode \\"All The Presidents' Heads\\" as the ancestor of Professor Hubert Farnsworth. As in history, he was presented as a counterfeiter and British agent. However, in an alternate timeline featured in the episode, he killed George Washington and was granted a dukedom.

It is one of the South American trees with a cinnamon-like aroma and is used as a spice called ispinku in Southern QuechuaTeofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Biling√ºe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) or ishpinku in Kichwa (Hispanicized spellings ishpingo, eshpingo). Growth conditions Ispinku seeds have a diameter of almost 1 inch and grow in soil which is mildly acidic. It grows at an annual rate of roughly 6 inches for the first three years of its life. After flowering starts, the flowers are produced once every two years. Use as a flavouring The bark is used to produce 'Ecuadorian' (or 'American') cinnamon which bears some resemblance to common cinnamon (which also comes from a tree in this family). The tree is known in Quechua languages as ispinku, which specifically refers to the flowers, and more recently as Flor de Canela. The taste of Ecuadorian cinnamon is thought to come from the presence of methyl cinnamate and trans-cinnamaldehyde which are also found in the essential oils which come from the flower calices of the plant. Some reports show it has been used as a flavouring since Incaic times, and modern Ecuadorians still use this spice during general cooking and the production of food for rituals. Offerings to family ancestors for example, sometimes include food such as mazamorra morada (purple pudding) and beverages such as the alcoholic drink alajua, both of which require the use of ispinku as a key ingredient. Medicinal uses front cupule The oils have previously been used in the traditional medicine of some Amazonian tribes for their anti- inflammatory properties and some peer-reviewed data also support this theory. Investigation of trans-cinnamaldehyde showed that it significantly reduced the production of NO by macrophages (cells of the immune system), which is something that normally occurs during inflammation. The same study of methyl cinnamate did not show this effect. It has also been shown that this oil can reduce the chance of blood clot formation by preventing platelet aggregation in the blood.

Muscle Milk Team Cytosport finished second in the LMP class just 20 points behind Patr√≥n Highcroft Racing and Graf finished second in the Drivers' Championship. The 2011 season saw the two LMP classes split again to LMP1 and LMP2. Cost capping regulations enforced by the ACO made the RS Spyder too expensive to run in the LMP2 class. The team took this opportunity and bought a Lola-Aston Martin B08/62 and returned to the LMP1 class. Lucas Luhr joined the team for the full season with Pickett only entering in the longer races of Sebring and Petit Le Mans. Unfortunately, there was not much competition during the start of the season with Dyson Racing Team being the only other full-time LMP1 entry, who later entered a second car. This was followed by Autocon Motorsports who returned with their updated Lola B06/10. Despite winning four events over the course of the season, Muscle Milk Aston Martin Racing's retirement at the season opening 12 Hours of Sebring with a mechanical failure left the team with a points deficit. At season's end they would finish second in the Teams' and Drivers' Championship with the Dyson team taking the title. 2012 saw Muscle Milk Pickett Racing campaign Honda's latest LMP1 car, the HPD ARX-03a, for the full season. Klaus Graf and Lucas Luhr continued as primary drivers. The team also expanded to the LMPC ranks with an Oreca FLM09 piloted by Michael Guasch and Memo Gidley. The team ran the LMPC car for three races before withdrawing after the Laguna Seca round after reconsideration from the team. The #6 HPD car, after some bad luck with a fueling hose at Sebring, went on to win the next five races in a row and another win at Virginia International Raceway. At the season's final race, Petit Le Mans, Lucas Luhr was hit by a GTC class Porsche. Despite repairs needed during the race, the team was able to complete 70% of the race in order to win points. The team won both the LMP1 Drivers' and Teams' Championships with just 5 points over their main rivals, Dyson Racing. For 2013, the team continued competition with their HPD ARX-03a for the first three rounds before moving to the updated -03c for the remainder of the season. For the first three races, the team faced serious competition from the Swiss Rebellion Racing team. After losing out at the season opening 12 Hours of Sebring the team claimed the next two races at Long Beach and Laguna Seca. With Rebellion Racing withdrawing their full season entry to focus on 2014 plans, the Muscle Milk team won the next six races over the Dyson Racing squad and claimed the Teams' and Drivers' Championships. Rebellion Racing returned for Petit Le Mans, the final race of the American Le Mans Series before it would merge with the Rolex Sports Car Series to form the new United SportsCar Championship.

Completed in 1826, the Late Georgian-style house was built for Alabama's second governor, Thomas Bibb. Originally located at the center of a agricultural forced-labor complex, the red brick main house is one of the earliest Alabama examples of a stereotypical columned plantation house. The house and surrounding were added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 1972. History As the area was still being converted from a frontier, there was no sawed lumber or ready-made brick available when Bibb set out to build the house. So he used the profits from crops grown by enslaved people to raise a sawmill and build a brick kiln. Bibb enslaved skilled artisans to produce the construction materials and build the house. It took him several years to find and enslave a highly skilled mason and an expert carpenter. The house was basically complete by 1826, although work on various buildings of the plantation complex continued up to 1835. Bibb died in 1839, but the plantation remained in his family until 1941. At that time it was purchased by Dr. and Mrs. Berthold Kennedy, who renovated the mansion shortly afterwards. Another renovation was completed in 1967. At that time a kitchen wing and garage were built and some minor interior modifications were done. Architecture The two-story brick structure features exterior walls that are thick, laid in Flemish bond. The front (east) elevation of the house is dominated by a monumental Tuscan hexastyle portico that spans the entire five-bay, wide front facade. The floor of the stylobate and the columns are brick. The portico shelters the main front entrance with its delicate fanlight and sidelights in the central bay. A three-part window is centered above the front entrance. The remaining bays are defined by rectangular twelve-over- twelve sash windows on both levels. A hip roof, originally crowned by a balustrade, covers both the portico and main structure. An original one-story, semi-detached brick service wing with three rooms is located towards the rear of the house, on the south side. The main house and grounds of Belle Mina in 2011. The house and grounds were originally surrounded by a high brick wall. It was demolished during the Civil War. The rooftop deck and balustrade were destroyed in a tornado on July 16, 1875. The interior of the house features Federal style woodwork, Adam style fireplace mantels, and a spiral primary stairway. The floor plan is based on the center-hall prototype, with two large primary rooms to either side of a hallway. The first floor also features a side hall and a secondary stairway.

Early life Charles Edward Bandaranaike Corea was born in Sri Lanka to Cornelia Dias Bandaranaike and Simon Corea. Simon Corea was a son of David Christoffel Corea and was also a Justice of the Peace and succeeded his brother Johannes as Mudaliyar of Alutkuru Korale. He was the brother of Henry Richard, Mudaliyar of Alutkuru Korale, George Edmund, a Master of the Royal College, Jumeaux and Simon Corea. Later life The author Kumari Jayawardena described Charles Edward Bandaranaike Corea as a 'leading lawyer' from Chilaw in Sri Lanka. His three sons went on to play leading roles in Chilaw as well as gaining reputations as fearless freedom fighters of Sri Lanka. They founded the Chilaw Association and used it as a vehicle to campaign for independence from British rule. Charles Edward entered into the legal profession and became a Proctor of the Supreme Court. He married Henrietta Seneviratne and had five children, his three sons were Charles Edgar Corea, James Alfred Ernest Corea and Victor Corea and his two daughters were Agnes Eveline Rhoda and Evangeline Henrietta Corea. His eldest son Charles Edgar Corea and his youngest son Victor Corea followed in their father's footsteps and also entered the legal profession while James Alfred Ernest Corea became a doctor. Charles Edward's family lived in Ceylon and were known as one of the wealthiest families when he married into the Seneviratne family owning many acres of land. His three sons attended the famous Sri Lankan educational institution, S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. They excelled in different studies, most notably the eldest son Charles Edgar Corea who was described as 'One of the finest speakers of the English language' by Warden Stone of S. Thomas' College. The well known Sri Lankan author, Kumari Jayawardena, described Charles Edward as 'a leading lawyer' and also describes him and his family as 'a highly respected family in Chilaw'. Writing about the Coreas, Kumari Jayawardena observed: 'Unconnected to the liquor trade but making their money on plantation ventures was the Corea Family of Chilaw, an influential goyigama group with a history going back to Portuguese rule when they were warriors to Sinhala kings. During Dutch and British rule, members of the family were officials serving the state in various ways and rewarded with titles. Some members of the family took to the legal and medical professions, most notably the sons of Charles Edward Corea (a solicitor), who were active in local politics and in the Chilaw Association which campaigned against British land policies - especially the Waste Lands Ordinance, and for political reforms. The most active of Corea's sons was C. E. (Charles Edgar) who spoke up for peasant rights and was militant in his stand against the government. He was President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. C. E. Corea's brother, Alfred Ernest, was a doctor and the youngest Victor Corea was a lawyer who achieved fame for leading a campaign (and going to jail) in 1922 to protest the Poll Tax on all males; he was the first President of the Ceylon Labour Union led by A. E. Goonesinha and was active in the Ceylon Labour Party. While being professionals and political activists, the Coreas were also important landowners. ' Death Charles Edward Bandaranaike Corea died in 1872 at an early age leaving his five young children in the care of his wife Henrietta, who was only 21 at the time of her husband's death. His eldest son was only six years old and his youngest son Victor was only a year old. The three sons became men of high standing in Chilaw taking into the legal profession and the medical profession. Charles Edgar Corea and Victor Corea entered politics and made their home-town Chilaw a place of fame when Mahatma Gandhi came to visit them in 1927. They were freedom fighters during the period when Sri Lanka was under British Rule and stood up where there was injustice. James Alfred Ernest Corea also brought fame upon the Corea's by becoming a respected Doctor and what was most remarkable about him was that he charged no fees for the poor. The two daughters of Charles Edward and his wife Henrietta, Agnes and Evangeline, married into wealthy families. Ancestry Charles Edward was a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea, who was also known as Edirille Rala. He was given the two of the biggest kingdoms in Sri Lanka, Kotte and Sitawaka by Vimala Dharma Suriya, the King of Kandy. Domnicus Corea became a king in 1596 and a year later he was captured by the Portuguese forces and executed. He fought hard for and against the Portuguese who had invaded the island in 1505 and colonised Ceylon.

It can reach a diameter of 2 to 7 mm. The conus may occur anteriorly or posteriorly. If the bulging is spherical, instead of conical, the condition is referred to as lentiglobus. It produces a decrease in visual acuity and irregular refraction that cannot be corrected by either spectacle or contact lenses.http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lenticonus Biomicroscopically lenticonus is characterized by a transparent, localized, sharply demarcated conical projection of the lens capsule and cortex, usually axial in localization. In an early stage, retro-illumination shows an oil dropletconfiguration. Using a narrow slit, the image of a conus is observed. In a more advanced stage associated subcapsular and cortical opacities appear. Retinoscopically the oil droplet produces a pathognomonic scissors movement of the light reflex. This phenomenon is due to the different refraction in the central and the peripheral area of the lens. Ultrasonography also can illustrate the existence of a lenticonus. A-scan ultrasonography may reveal an increased lens thickness and B- scanultrasonography may show herniated lenticular material, suggestive of a lenticonus.

He was the abbot of Santa Mar√≠a de Nogales before being promoted bishop of the Diocese of Coria in 1155. The diocese seems to have been vacant since 1151 and sent no bishop to either the council of Salamanca (1154) or Valladolid (1155). It is possible that the visiting Papal legate Hyacinth ordered the king to appoint a bishop. The previous bishop, √ç√±igo Navarro, had also been a monk.Richard A. Fletcher (1978) The Episcopate in the Kingdom of Le√≥n in the Twelfth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 32‚Äì33. Coria was a poor frontier bishopric when Suero entered it. The lordship of the city had been divided equally after its reconquest in 1142 between the king, the bishop and the metropolitan (the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela). In 1157, on the death of King Alfonso VII, the diocese went to Le√≥n in the division of the kingdom and thus gained another frontier, this time with Castile. In 1163 the new king, Ferdinand II, gave exclusive lordship in the city to Santiago, but in 1168 transferred it again, this time to the Knights Templar, probably for reasons of military defence. In 1166 Ferdinand conquered the cities of Alc√°ntara and C√°ceres and added them to the diocese and lordship of the bishop of Coria. These new possessions, along with all earlier acquisitions, were confirmed by Pope Alexander III at Suero's request in 1168. Suero died in 1168 and was succeeded the next year (1169) by Peter I, a shadowy figure who died between 1174 and 1177, leaving the see vacant for another four years before Arnold I was appointed in 1181.

Millin served as the fourth Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands (and third elected Lt. Governor) from 1978 until 1983. Biography Early life Millin was born on the island of Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands on March 17, 1923, to Allan and Lucinda Sewer Millin. Millin's mother, Lucinda Sewer Millin, was a Senator in the Legislature of the Virgin Islands. She is the namesake of the Lucinda Millin Home for the Aged, a nursing home on Saint Thomas. In a prior relationship, Millin had a son, Leslie Millin Millin married Angela Correa Irizarry in 1950. The couple had two children‚ÄîInes Lucinda Millin and Henry Orville Millin. Millin later married Graciela G. Millin. The couple had two children - Janette and Juliette. Career Millin was employed as an accountant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Marine Corps early in his career. He also worked as a clerk both the Virgin Islands' Office of the Tax Assessor and the former Police and Prison Department. In 1950, Millin was appointed to the board of directors of the U.S.V.I. Housing Authority. He later become the executive director of the housing authority, holding the position for many years. Millin oversaw the construction of two major housing project complexes, Ludwig E. Harrigan Court on Saint Croix and Oswald Harris Court on Saint Thomas. In the early 1960s, U.S. President John F. Kennedy sent Millin a letter of commendation for his work as the housing authority's executive director. Kennedy recognized Millin for operating one of the best run housing authorities out of the 1,300 in the United States at the time. He then worked for The West Indian Company on Saint Thomas before taking a position in the Virgin Islands National Bank in 1965, where he worked in the bank's mortgage department. Millin would be promoted to senior vice president of the Virgin Islands National Bank. By 1978, Millin had become the senior vice president of the First Pennsylvania Bank, which had acquired V.I. National Bank. Lieutenant Governor Governor Cyril King died in office on January 2, 1978. King's lieutenant governor, Juan Francisco Luis, was sworn into office as the next Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on the same day. Luis' elevation to the governor's office left the position of lieutenant governor temporarily vacant until Luis could choose his successor. Governor Luis considered several candidates for Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, including Millin, Edith Bornn, a lawyer from Saint Thomas, and Julio Brady. Luis ultimately chose Millin for lieutenant governor, as well as his running mate in the 1978 gubernatorial election. Millin was initially reluctant to accept the appointment, but reportedly changed his mind through the persuasion of members from each of the U.S.V.I.'s major political parties and islands. Governor Luis announced Millin's appointment as Lt. Governor on February 21, 1978, in a broadcast on radio and television. Millin was a member of the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, while Governor Luis was a member of the Independent Citizens Movement (ICM) at the time. However, Luis, who was planning to run in the 1978 gubernatorial election, dropped his political affiliation with the ICM to run as an independent, nonpartisan candidate for governor. Millin's Democratic affiliation was seen as a complement for Luis' candidacy and the nonpartisan coalition he hoped to build. Millin was sworn into office on March 10, 1978, at Government House on Saint Thomas. Governor Juan Luis and Lt. Governor Henry Millin were elected to a full, four-year term November 7, 1978. They defeating Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ron de Lugo by a wide margin in a tough election campaign. Luis and Millin won 10,978 votes, or 59.2%, while the Democratic ticket of Ron de Lugo and Eric Dawson placed second with 7,568 votes, or 40.8% of the total votes cast. Luis and Millin also won all three of the main islands, including a landslide victory on Saint Croix. James O'Bryan, Jr., a family friend of Millin's who had just graduated from college, served as the Luis-Millin campaign manager and later as Millin's public relations assistant during his term as Lt. Governor. In 1982, Lt. Governor Millin announced his intention to challenge Governor Luis in the gubernatorial election. Luis named Julio Brady as his running mate, though Millin remained lieutenant governor until January 1983. The 1982 gubernatorial race consisted of five candidates for Governor, including Millin and Luis, who was seeking re-election. Luis won the election with 11,354 votes, while Millin placed second with 4,143 votes. A group of fourteen U.S. Virgin Islands residents filed a lawsuit challenging the results due to the counting of blank ballots, which would have resulted in a runoff election between Luis and Millin, as Luis would have had less than 50% of vote if the blank or incomplete ballots were thrown out. However, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia rejected the lawsuit, eliminating any potential runoff election between Luis and Millon. Millin left office in early January 1983 and was succeeded by Julio Brady. Later life Millin opened and operated a real estate appraisal firm after leaving office in 1983. He ran the business until his retirement in the mid-1990s. Millin served as the president of the St. Thomas and Saint John Chamber of Commerce for two consecutive terms. He was also a member of the Rotary Club on Saint Thomas. In 2001, the 24th Legislature of the Virgin Islands honored Millin for his contributions to the Virgin Islands Housing Authority.

Biography Raisbeck grew up in Whitefish Bay, a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After high school, he entered Purdue University (1954), with the goal of studying mechanical engineering. However, he lasted only one semester before flunking out. Having to find a way to support a wife and daughter, he joined the US Air Force as an E-1. He served as a flight engineer on Convair B-36 bombers.Pia Bergovist, Raisbeck Engineering: James Raisbeck has made a career of making good airplanes better Flying, September 2011, pp. 66-70 After his four-year enlistment in the USAF, Raisbeck returned in 1958 to Purdue University. To help cover the costs of tuition and living expenses, he signed up for active reserve duty with the 434th Troop Carrier Wing at Bakalar AFB, Columbus, Indiana, as a flight engineer on Fairchild C-119s. He graduated in 1961 with a degree in aeronautical engineering, science and mathematics.James Raisbeck: Breathing New Technology into Aviation Retrieved 25 July 2011 Raisbeck moved to Seattle, Washington and joined Boeing as a research aerodynamicist in 1961.Flying His first boss was Louis \\"Bernie\\" Gratzer, head of Boeing's aerodynamics research group. (Gratzer would, after retirement, join forces with Joe Clark at Aviation Partners Inc., developing their blended winglets.) While at Boeing, Raisbeck and a team of engineers and flight crew designed and flight-tested an internally blown trailing edge flap system on the prototype 707, 367-80, known as the Dash 80. The Dash 80 first flew in December 1963, and soon demonstrated flight at speeds as slow as 60 knots, at gross weights exceeding 150,000 lbs. Raisbeck's later assignments at Boeing included liaison with the aeronautical laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and as a designer and program manager in preliminary design at Boeing.James D. Raisbeck biography Retrieved 25 July 2011 Raisbeck had not used any of his allowed vacation time while working at Boeing. He eventually was forced by the payroll department to use his accumulated vacation time. While on vacation, he went to work for Robertson Aircraft, a Seattle-based small business that specialized in developing and certifying STOL kits for single- and twin-engine Cessna and Piper aircraft. In 1969 Raisbeck left Boeing to work full-time at Robertson Aircraft, where he soon became chairman, CEO, president and chief engineer. At Robertson, Raisbeck participated in the development and construction of the University of Kansas Redhawk, a modified Cessna 177 Cardinal and the Advanced Technology Light Twin, a modified Piper PA-34 Seneca, both under contract to NASA. The Redhawk wing featured movable leading edge devices, Fowler flaps and spoilers for roll control. In 1970 he negotiated with Pierre Clostermann to have Reims Aviation install Robertson STOL kits onto production Reims F337 Skymasters. In 1973 the expanded Robertson Aircraft Company was sold to an investment company, and Raisbeck left. He worked for one year for Allen E. Paulson at American Jet Industries in Los Angeles as vice president of technology. Deciding he wanted to start his own company, he founded Raisbeck Engineering in 1973, on his dining room table, with $500.Flying, p. 68 His first project was the task of redesigning the wings of the Learjet for Gates Learjet. Clay Lacy had introduced Raisbeck to Dee Howard, founder of Howard Aero and The Dee Howard Company. Having problems with the wing redesign, Raisbeck became partners with Howard in February 1975, to enable him to complete the development of the Mark II system. The modification was intended to reduce the approach and takeoff speeds of the Learjet family. With Howard's help, he finished the program and Gates Learjet adopted the Mark II wing's principles in 1976. The system's enhancement of the low-speed Learjet flight characteristics and short runway performance led Gates Learjet to adopt the highly successful technology on new production aircraft, beginning in 1976.Flying, p. 67 In 1976 Rockwell contracted Raisbeck to redesign the wing of its Sabreliner series.Flying p. 67 All production Sabreliner 65 aircraft would be equipped with supercritical wings to be developed by Raisbeck, and Sabreliner models 60 and 80 would be retrofitted. The resulting Mark V wing was the first supercritical wing in service in the United States. Raisbeck built all 75 wing sets for the Sabre 65 in Seattle, and shipped them to Rockwell in El Segundo, California. His company now had 750 employees, most working on the supercritical wing program. Although the program was a technical success, by 1979, Raisbeck's company was in financial distress. Raisbeck declared bankruptcy in 1979. On his own, in 1979 he developed the Mark IV Wing System for the Learjet 35/36 family of aircraft. This system reduced the aircraft's approach speeds, increased the level of operating safety. Raisbeck regrouped and reformed his company in 1981, with five employees. His vice-president, Joe Clark, arranged a deal with Morrison-Knudsen and got Raisbeck started on developing the Mark VI system of performance enhancements for the Beech Super King Air. Clark would later go on to co-found Horizon Airlines and Aviation Partners Inc.. The Mark VI system included nacelle wing lockers,The lockers are mounted behind each engine, atop the wing. They are certified to carry 300 pounds (136 kg) each, with items up to 7.2 feet (2.2m) in length, and 8 cubic feet (0.23 m3) per side. dual aft body strakes,The strakes smooth the previously turbulent air aft of the fuselage-wing intersection. \\"... one customer refuses to fly any King Air that does not have Raisbeck's dual aft body strakes because of the differences in the noise level and vibration inside the cabin.\\" Flying, p. 69.

The locker was also later certified for use on the Learjet 31. Turning to airliners, in 1996 the Raisbeck Commercial Air Group completed recertification of the Boeing 727 to meet Stage 3 noise limits without weight and performance penalties. The Raisbeck Stage 3 Noise Reduction Systems for the Boeing 727 covered all models and weights. Aerodynamic innovation provided Stage 3 noise compliance without costly engine modifications, saving their operators several million dollars on each installation. American Airlines ordered and took delivery of 52 Raisbeck 727 Stage 3 systems. Other customers have included TWA, Pan Am, Air Algerie, TAME and many smaller airlines.Boeing 727 Stage 3 Noise Reduction Kits Retrieved 25 July 2011 In August 2001 Raisbeck delivered a redesigned overhead bin system For JetBlue's fleet of Airbus A320s. Because of the design of enlarged bins, popular, 22-inch, upright bags carried by passengers could be stored crosswise, with the handle facing the door. The redesigned overhead door and extended bin floor almost double the usable overhead storage space, allowing for quick and easy baggage stowage. Raisbeck has now equipped all of JetBlue's Airbus fleet of more than 100 aircraft.Airbus A320 Overhead Bin Enlargement Kits Retrieved 25 July 2011 Raisbeck began developing bulletproof doors and bulkheads for Boeing 737s and 757s in 2000 (before the September 11-mandated FAA requirement). Four weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the first of Raisbeck's prototype Hardened Cockpit Security System was installed. Alaska Airlines, American Trans Air and other airlines operating the Boeing 737 immediately ordered and took delivery of the cockpit doors. The doors included rapid decompression, emergency pilot egress and crash-crew cockpit ingress, bulletproof protection, cockpit-to-cabin visual identification and structural integrity. In March 2002 Raisbeck turned over its flight deck security business and customers to Boeing.Boeing 737 Hardened Cockpit Security System Retrieved 25 July 2011 Returning to business aircraft in 2002‚Äì2005, Raisbeck developed the ZR LITE performance enhancement system for the Learjet 35/36 aircraft. The ZR LITE wing and flap system reduces cruise drag by almost 10 percent and increases the FAA-certified takeoff performance, allowing these airplanes to operate safely into and out of many previously unavailable airports. The Learjet 35/36 were first to be certified, in 2005, followed by the Learjet 31/31A in 2006. Bombardier Aviation Services and other independent Learjet maintenance facilities make these kit installations in the U.S. and internationally.Learjet Products Retrieved 25 July 2011 Work is currently underway at Raisbeck Engineering on developing an aft fuselage locker system for the Learjet 60 aircraft.
