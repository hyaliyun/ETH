Karmal faces increasing friction within the Revolutionary Council and other wings of the government. One of the most striking evidences of Khalq-Parcham feuding comes when Karmal removes his deputy prime minister, Assadullah Sarwari, a prominent Khalqi, and three other Khalq followers from the scene by appointing them as ambassadors. Sarwari, who was once considered a potential Soviet choice to replace Karmal, is named envoy to Mongolia after a sojourn in the Soviet Union. There are reports of assassinations of Khalqis by Parchamites and vice versa, and bitter interparty fighting is said to have spread to army units and government agencies in various parts of the country. Karmal reshuffles his cabinet, promoting Sultan Ali Keshtmand, a trusted Parchamite colleague, to replace Sarwari as first deputy prime minister. Incumbents * President: Babrak Karmal * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Babrak Karmal January 14, 1980 A special session of the UN General Assembly passes a resolution (104-18) calling for the immediate withdrawal of \\"foreign troops\\" in Afghanistan. Similar resolutions are passed in subsequent years until November 10, 1987, when the vote in favour reaches a record 123. January 29, 1980 An emergency session of the Conference of Islamic States, convening in Islamabad, Pakistan, condemns the \\"Soviet military aggression against the Afghan people\\" and demands that all Soviet troops be withdrawn immediately. The foreign ministers also suspend Afghanistan from their organization and ask that their respective governments sever diplomatic relations with it. February 1980 Anti-Soviet feeling among the Afghans rises to a high pitch, when a general strike and violent demonstrations are staged against the Soviet presence in Kabul and other major cities. The mass uprising is quelled as Afghan armed forces and Communist militia inflict heavy casualties on the demonstrators. As cases of Soviet soldiers disappearing begin to increase, the Soviet troops assume more and more direct control of the security situation from the Afghan Army. The Soviets unleash a series of offensives against insurgents in the provinces of Paktia, Konarha, Ghazni, Herat, Kandahar, and Badakhshan. The demonstrations are repeated at the end of April, this time staged by students from Kabul University and other educational institutions. The April demonstrations, which occur during the anniversary celebrations of the Saur (April) Revolution launched by former president Taraki on April 27, 1978, result in the brutal killings of more than 50 students. May 1980 Attempts to bring about a peaceful solution of the Afghan crisis and Soviet withdrawal from the country are made by the Islamic Conference in Islamabad, Pakistan. No headway can be made, however. Pakistan refuses to have any direct talks with the Karmal regime, since this would involve recognition of the Soviet-backed government. Karmal insists that all subversive activities against his country must stop before any international discussion on the crisis could be held. June 1980 The Soviet Union announces a token withdrawal of one of its divisions, but this fails to placate the Afghans. Despite intense propaganda by President Karmal, Afghan state organs, and the Soviet government to the effect that the Soviet presence had a \\"limited\\" purpose and the troops would pull out as soon as peace was restored, the Karmal regime is finding itself more and more isolated from the people. Except for a small percentage consisting of ruling PDPA cadres, bureaucrats, and intellectuals, no section of the population accepts the government's thesis: that all the country's ills either are caused by saboteurs and agents from Pakistan and the U.S. or result from the tyrannical measures adopted by the short-lived regime of Karmal's predecessor, Hafizullah Amin. Increasingly, Karmal is finding himself in a dilemma, because the very Soviet troops who are arousing such resistance from his countrymen are the only force preventing the collapse of his government. Meanwhile, several regional groups, collectively known as Mujahideen (from the Persian word meaning \\"warriors\\"), have united inside Afghanistan, or across the border in Peshawar, to resist the Soviet invaders and the Soviet-backed Afghan Army. The Afghan Army's strength is down to 32,000 from an estimated 80,000 at the time of the Soviet intervention, due to large-scale desertions. September 1980 Outside estimates place the number of Afghans seeking shelter in Pakistan at over 900,000. October 16, 1980 Karmal begins an extended visit to Moscow, where he is welcomed by Soviet Pres. Leonid Brezhnev. Their subsequent discussion and joint signature of a document in the Kremlin is seen as a formal acknowledgment of the Afghan government's puppet status. November 1980 It is disclosed that Egypt is sending arms to the Mujahideen.

Originally released for the Xbox 360, it was also released for Microsoft Windows via Steam. On December 30, 2010, Virtual Programming published the Mac OS X version of the game. The plot of the game involves time travel; it features the American Indian Wars, the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and Ancient Rome. Plot In Darkest of Days the player controls Alexander Morris, a soldier fighting in General Custer's battalion during the Battle of Little Big Horn at the beginning of the game. After Custer is killed and Morris is wounded he is suddenly rescued by a man in futuristic armor and taken through a strange portal. Morris then awakens in the headquarters of Kronotek, an organization that has managed to develop time travel technology and is apparently dedicated to researching and protecting history. A Kronotek higher-up known as \\"Mother\\" tells Morris that Doctor Koell, the organization's founder, has gone missing and disturbances have started appearing through history, causing individuals that have played key roles in history to be placed in danger, and tasks Morris with helping Kronotek restore history. Morris then begins his combat training with his new partner Agent Dexter, another MIA from history who is implied to have gone missing on 9/11. As he is from the 1800s, he requires a crash course in \\"modern\\" weaponry (ranging from World War I to the late 22nd century). Upon completion of his training Mother tasks Morris and Dexter with tracking down two individuals who are not where they are supposed to be: one Corporal Welsh from the Union Army in the American Civil War at the Battle of Antietam, and a Russian Army Officer named Petrovich in World War I at the Battle of Tannenberg. However, completion of both of these tasks is blocked by a mysterious group known only as the Opposition, which also has time-travel technology. Over the course of the game, Morris and Dexter have to fight through both the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Tannenberg, which involve massive cornfield battles, the dynamiting of a train bridge, and the hijacking of a zeppelin. Although Agents Morris and Dexter manage to secure and reintegrate Welsh and his twin brother into the proper timeframe, Petrovich is labeled a traitor for abandoning his post. This causes his son, who was originally going to become a scientist, to enlist in the Russian Army during the Second World War, leading to his capture by the Wehrmacht. When Agents Morris and Dexter try to rescue him before he reaches a POW camp, Morris is also captured and sent to the camp. After spending some time in the camp, Petrovich is sentenced to death because of an escape attempt, but right before his execution, an explosion goes off outside the camp. Agent Dexter appears and assists Morris, Petrovich and the other inmates in escaping. Once Petrovich reaches safety, Dexter informs Morris that Morris was the one who set the explosive, allowing Dexter to infiltrate the camp. So Morris goes back, fights his way through a Nazi facility, and sets the explosive that triggers his own release. After rescuing Petrovich, Morris and Dexter find out that Koell is at Pompeii, on August 25, 79 AD, the day Mt. Vesuvius erupted and buried the Roman town. Agents Morris and Dexter and a tech specialist named Bob fight through hordes of Opposition agents to find Koell, who is in the town's arena. Koell then nonchalantly accompanies Morris and Dexter back to the 22nd century. Upon arriving in the 22nd century, a strange man appears, claiming to be the head of the Opposition. (It later transpires that the Opposition is a future version of Kronotek). The man asks Koell if it is wrong to change terrible events that already happened, to which Koell answers yes, because \\"dark days teach valuable lessons and define who we are\\". The Man then shoots Koell twice, once in the chest and once in the head. When confronted by Morris and Dexter, he explains that the Welshes and Petrovich were ancestors of scientists who invented a DNA sequencer that can target the genomes defining racial identity. He goes on to explain that this DNA sequencer was stolen and used by less talented Middle Eastern scientists to create a virus that targeted people of European descent. 2 billion died as a result (including eight out of every ten people in North America). As Dexter laments the loss of his family, the strange man states that this crisis has been averted because of the Opposition's interference with the time stream. He also says that they tried to make Koell change his mind about changing past events, but even with direct evidence that changing that event would not affect the timeline couldn't convince him, so they went with the last resort of killing him. Although he makes clear that Kronotek's ultimate goal is still the preservation of the time stream, he indicates that this one exception was made. The strange man then says that his Kronotek has use for talented agents such as Morris and Dexter and invites them to join his agency, leaving an open time bubble for them to enter. As the strange man departs, Dexter looks at the camera and says, \\"What the Hell do we do now brother?\\" Development Since the premise of Darkest of Days leans heavily on the historical aspect of its story, the developers focused on making the battles as historically accurate as possible. They incorporated extensive research on the time periods, locations, and weapons for each of the battles depicted in the game (much of the city of Pompeii is accurately recreated). Darkest of Days uses NVIDIA PhysX, a hardware-accelerated physics engine. > \\"It was critical to the success of Darkest of Days that these epic moments > in world history are experienced in eerily accurate detail, and NVIDIA PhysX > technology helped us achieve that goal,\\" said Mark Doeden, Art Director at > 8monkey Labs. \\"Our Marmoset Engine brings these battles to life with a > completely unique look, and the PhysX technology was instrumental in making > the game feel alive and real.\\" 8Monkey Labs designed the Marmoset engine specifically for the game. The Marmoset engine can handle over 300 characters on the screen at one time, enabling the game to have densely populated battle scenes, all with their own AI and pathfinding. Darkest of Days also contains wide open battlefields, allowing players to choose their own course of action to accomplish the goals set in the game (however, there are numerous limitations imposed on a player's movements throughout a map via obstacles and invisible walls). The player is also equipped with futuristic weapons adding a unique twist to classic battles. Marmoset's AI is able to drive behaviors for hundreds of characters simultaneously, without impeding gameplay. All actions share a common set of sensory data - audio, vision, navigation, teammate signals, enemy fire detection, and object finding and following are all easily made available to all behaviors. Reception The PC version received \\"mixed\\" reviews, while the Xbox 360 version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many reviewers, including Francis Clarke of ApertureGames, expressed disappointment that the majority of the levels are played out primarily in two time periods. However, PC Gamer UK said that \\"Darkest of Days is a unique first person shooter\\". Positive reviews also came for the Xbox 360; Digital Chumps said it provided a \\"unique and overall well put together single player campaign. Any fan of action games or time travel mechanics should give this one a serious look\\", while GameShark commented that \\"technicalities take a pretty good game and drag it down into the realm of mediocrity. Still, automatic weapons during a Civil War battle...it's hard to pass that up.\\" References External links  Category:2009 video games Category:American Civil War video games Category:First-person shooters Category:MacOS games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Valcon Games games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using PhysX Category:Windows games Category:World War I video games Category:World War II video games Category:Video games set in antiquity Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Cultural depictions of George Armstrong Custer Category:Video games set in the Roman Empire ","title":"Darkest of Days"},{"id":"11659771","text":"Sen-Yong Su Sen-Yong Su/Su Sen-Yong (ËòáÊ£ÆÂ¢â) (8 July 1919 - 18 May 2007) was a prominent music educator at the Hsinchu Senior High School, in Taiwan.

Geography  Valley of the sugar mills at the south skirts of Escambray Mountains Topes de Collantes, literally Collantes‚Äô Highs, almost above sea level, along with Potrerillo peak, and tallest San Juan peak, are located in the Escambray range. These mountains are shared by the three central provinces of the island; Villa Clara Province to the north, Cienfuegos Province and Sancti Spiritus Province to the west and east respectively. The wet winds coming off the Atlantic Ocean have made the north face of the mountains a luxurious refuge for plants and animals, while the drier south face hosts important ecosystems, in which lie two famous UNESCO World Heritage sites; Valle de los Ingenios (Valley of the Sugar Mills), and Trinidad city, both living examples of early 17th-century wealthy colonial Cuba.  Nature  tropical rainforest Nature is the big attraction here. Caves, rivers, falls, grottos, canyons, natural pools with crystal clear water, mountain hills surrounded by mariposa (butterfly lily, Hedychium coronarium) Cuba‚Äôs national flower announcing their presence with a soft unique flagrance from June to early September. More than 40 indigenous species of orchids and 100 species of ferns, of which 7 are tall palm-like tree ferns, wild plantain and banana trees, jasmine, begonias, several representatives of the ginger family and around 40 species of coffee are growing under the shade of giant 40 meter tall pines, eucalyptus, West Indian mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni) and magnolias making the wonder of this tropical rainforest. Important animal species live here as well. They include the Cartacuba (Todus multicolor), Cuban ivory- billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii), unique hummingbirds, and the tocororo (Priotelus temnurus), which is Cuba's national bird.  History  La Represa Park, Martha Batista's house Coffee growers were living in the area when president Fulgencio Batista ordered the construction of a massive battleship-like Art Deco sanatorium for tuberculosis patients in 1954. Rumor has it that his wife Martha was battling against this illness and once there she fell in love for the place. As a result she persuaded Batista to build her a cottage in the area as well. After the Revolution the hospital was converted into a school, and in the mid-1970s it was returned to a similar use as a hotel specialized in rehabilitation and special therapies. The Kurhotel is also famous for its vast collection of original Cuban art. Scattered in its 210 rooms, lobbies and halls, almost 800 pieces of art from the most famous Cuban painters of all times can be found. As a result, a small worker‚Äôs settlement was developed around the place. The Universidad de Monta√±a or Mountain Campus of Las Villas University was built here in the 1980s. Due to its connection with Trinidad city and the beaches of the Ancon peninsula a couple more hotels and a resort villa catering to tourist have been developed.  Attractions  Almacigo tree (Bursera simaruba) in Ancon beach, Trinidad One of the many naturals pools in Caburni river There are several places to go, these are some of the most popular trips: Caburni Falls, at about is the most popular hike through coffee plantations, traditional farmers houses, and cliffs to end in Caburni river which falls from a rock wall into a series of ponds. La Batata, from the city, offers scenic views as well, ending in an underground river-cave system with several levels of natural ponds. Hacienda Codina, a ranch with several attractions: medicinal mud baths, medicinal and ornamental gardens, the orchid‚Äôs collection has more than 40 local species including bamboo; Altar‚Äôs cave from where a secret passage ends in a natural lookout facing south of the mountain system and the Valley of the sugar mills, Trinidad and Ancon can be seen. Paseo Ecologico, Ecology walk, local path connecting the Kurhotel with hotel ‚ÄúLos helechos‚Äù filled with mariposa shrubs and arborescent ferns under the canopy of pines and eucalyptus. Parque La represa, a park developed around the original house built for Batista‚Äôs wife Martha. Placed on the banks of River Vega Grande, there is an arboretum with more than 300 exotic species. The highest and oldest mahogany ever found in Cuba lives in this place. Snak Bar ‚ÄúEl mirador‚Äù, literally The Lookout, it in the way down to Trinidad, between the Valley and the range in the back, but still 600 meters above sea level offers views of the city and peninsula below. With around 500 years of history in its stone built streets and colonial architecture the UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage Site of Trinidad is located close to the white sands and blue waters of Ancon and La Boca beaches.

Fighting between the Mujahideen jihadists and the Afghan Army backed by Soviet forces is less widespread as the government appears to be in better control of the insurgency problem in general. Karmal, whose position has been considered shaky, is also firmly in command as his Parcham faction of the ruling PDPA manages to eliminate most of the pro-Khalq elements from the government and the party. Diego Cordovez, UN special representative for Afghanistan, visits the capitals of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to convince their leaders of the necessity to find a peaceful settlement. Clashes between insurgents and security forces are mainly centred on the Panjsher Valley, about 70 km northeast of Kabul. Bitter fighting takes place in this region during June‚ÄìAugust. The Afghan Army and the Soviets commit numerous ground troops supported by helicopter gunships and MiG jet fighters to dislodge rebels from the valley. Rebel sources in Pakistan admit that the rebels have to take refuge in nearby mountains but insist that they are preparing to fight back. As a result of large-scale operations by Soviet and Afghan forces, Kandahar, in the south, also seems more secure. Western news agency reports estimate casualties in fighting since the Soviet intervention at 20,000 Afghan and 10,000 Soviet troops. Little is known about rebel losses. Incumbents * President: Babrak Karmal * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand February 1982 Karmal signs a trade protocol with the Soviet Union that thrusts Afghanistan further into the Soviet economic orbit. Most Afghan exports go to the U.S.S.R., allowing a credit of 10 million rubles to Afghanistan for essential imports. March 1982 Karmal repeats that Afghanistan is ready to discuss proposals for a \\"flexible peace policy\\" with its neighbours but is thwarted by the hostile reaction of the U.S. and its allies. He also stresses his government's agreement with the U.S.S.R. on all policy matters. March 21, 1982 The U.S., the UK, and other Western countries again condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan on the start of the Afghan new year, which is proclaimed Afghanistan Day by Western nations. On the same day the U.S.S.R. declares its intention of staying in Afghanistan until the Kabul government is secure. The Soviet media criticizes the proclamation of Afghanistan Day as part of a \\"slanderous campaign\\" against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. June 1982 Afghan Foreign Minister Shah Mohammad Dost and his Pakistani counterpart, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, meet in Geneva, while Iran backed out. Cordovez says that at the meeting he broadly outlined the principles of an agreement in separate talks with Khan and Dost and that he also kept Iran informed of progress. Both sides, Cordovez maintains, accepted the main agenda items: withdrawal of troops, resettlement of an estimated three million Afghan refugees, and international guarantees on noninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Khan comments that talks are \\"still at a preliminary stage\\" and reiterates Pakistan's refusal to hold direct talks with Kabul until Pakistan recognizes the Kabul government. September 1982 Gen. Abdul Qadir is appointed minister of defense in place of Gen. Mohammad Rafi. Early November 1982 An explosion in a mountain tunnel north of Kabul is reported to have killed hundreds of Soviet soldiers and Afghan civilians. According to accounts that reach the West, the lead truck of a Soviet military convoy collided with an oncoming fuel truck. The resulting blast and burning gasoline ignited other vehicles, and most of the deaths are believed to have been caused by asphyxiation from the smoke and fumes that filled the tunnel. December 31, 1982 The Soviet news agency TASS declares that Soviet troops will remain in Afghanistan until long- standing Soviet conditions for their withdrawal (including an assurance of noninterference by Pakistan, Iran, and other nations in the internal affairs of Afghanistan) are met. Predictions of a change in Soviet policy toward Afghanistan had gained credence in some Western capitals after the death of Soviet Pres. Leonid Brezhnev in November 1982 and the appointment of Yuriy Andropov as his successor. Western analysts claimed that Andropov, in his previous post as head of the Soviet State Security Committee (KGB), had consistently opposed Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan.

A refugee during the Second Chechen War, Milana was one of eight Chechen students at the University of Grozny selected to study abroad by the human rights organization √âtudes Sans Fronti√®res in 2003, and she graduated with a master's degree in journalism from the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris in 2006. Biography Milana was born in the small village of Orekhovo, sixty kilometers west of the Chechen capital Grozny and near the border of Ingushetia, and she lived with her parents and grandmother, who had survived the forced deportations of most Chechens to Central Asia on 23 February 1944.Milana Terloeva : Danser sur les ruines. reseaudesbahuts.lautre.net (11 September 2006) As a child growing up in the Soviet Union, the family was relatively well-off, but suffered due to the spiraling increase in crime after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. One night in January 1993, someone left a large iron case outside the family doorstep. Inside was the body of Milana's father, assassinated. After the beginning of the First Chechen War on 11 December 1994, Milana and her family first took refuge in their cellar, and lived without running water or electricity. As the situation in her village worsened further, her family took refuge in Grozny, which had already been ruined following the siege of the city. The family returned to Orekhovo at the end of the war in 1996, and they found that their homes had been extensively looted, and Russian soldiers living in her house had soiled everything with their excrement, including her prized ball gown, in an effort to humiliate them.Dominique Simonnet ‚ÄúMilana Terloeva: En Tch√©tch√©nie, survivre c'est d√©j√† resister‚Äù , L‚ÄôExpress (7 September 2006) With the start of the Second Chechen War, Milana and her family sought refuge in Ingushetia along with hundreds of thousands of other refugees. She returned to Grozny six months later, and enrolled in the heavily damaged University of Grozny, studying the French language with dreams of continuing her education in Europe. She aspired to become a journalist so that she would be able to bring justice to victims of the conflict. A group of French students opposed to the new war in Chechnya started the organization Etudes Sans Fronti√®res in March 2003 as a means for rescuing Chechen students from the war zone and providing them with a French education. (In 1997, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Western nations to allow Chechen students into their universities, as he dreamed of liberally oriented leaders who would be capable of rebuilding a society that had been destroyed by war. The call fell on deaf ears, and at the time only madrassas from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan opened their doors to Chechens). By that September, the organization had sponsored eight Chechen students, including Milana, to study in Paris.Andr√© and Rapha√´l Glucksmann, ‚ÄúA bridge to Chechnya‚Äù, www.signandsight.com (5 January 2007).

An uprising in several sepoy companies of the Bengal army was sparked by the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle February, 1857. Many sepoys believed that the cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat. Loading the Enfield required tearing open the greased cartridge with one's teeth. This would have insulted both Hindu and Muslim religious practices; cows were considered holy by Hindus, while pigs were considered unclean by Muslims. Underlying grievances over British taxation and recent land annexations by the British East Indian Company (BEIC) were ignited by the sepoy mutineers, and within weeks, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The old aristocracy, both Muslim and Hindu, who were seeing their power steadily eroded by the BEIC, also rebelled against British rule. Another important source of discontent among the Indian rulers was that the British policies of conquest had created unrest among many Indian rulers. In the decade prior to the rebellion, the BEIC imposed a 'doctrine of lapse' (of Indian leadership succession), and the policy 'subsidiary alliance' both of which deprived Indian ruler. Frictions Some Indians were upset with the draconian rule of the Company who had embarked on a project of territorial expansion and westernisation that was imposed without any regard for historical subtleties in Indian society. Furthermore, legal changes introduced by the British were accompanied by prohibitions on Indian religious customs and were seen as steps towards forced conversion to Christianity. As early as the Charter Act of 1813 Christian missionaries were encouraged to come to Bombay and Calcutta under BEIC control. The British Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856 was Lord Dalhousie who passed the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856 which allowed widows to remarry, like Christian women. He also passed decrees allowing Hindus who had converted to Christianity to be able to inherit property, which had previously been denied by local practice. Author Pramod Nayar points out that by 1851 there were nineteen Protestant religious societies operating in India whose goal was the conversion of Indians to Christianity. Christian organisations from Britain had additionally created 222 \\"unattached\\" mission stations across India in the decade preceding the rebellion. Religious disquiet as the cause of rebellion underlies the work of historian William Dalrymple who asserts that the rebels were motivated primarily by resistance to the actions of the British East India Company, especially under James Broun-Ramsay reign, which were perceived as attempts to impose Christianity and Christian laws in India. For instance, once the rebellion was underway, Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar met the sepoys on 11 May 1857, he was told: \\"We have joined hands to protect our religion and our faith.\\" They later stood in Chandni Chowk, the main square, and asked the people gathered there, \\"Brothers, are you with those of the faith?\\" Those European men and women who had previously converted to Islam such as Sergeant-Major Gordon, and Abdullah Beg, a former Company soldier, were spared. In contrast, foreign Christians such as Revd Midgeley John Jennings, and Indian converts to Christianity such as one of Zafar's personal physicians, Dr. Chaman Lal, were killed. Dalrymple further points out that as late as 6 September, when calling the inhabitants of Delhi to rally against the upcoming Company assault, Zafar issued a proclamation stating that this was a religious war being prosecuted on behalf of 'the faith', and that all Muslim and Hindu residents of the imperial city, or of the countryside were encouraged to stay true to their faith and creeds. As further evidence, he observes that the Urdu sources of the pre- and post-rebellion periods usually refer to the British not as angrez (the English), goras (whites) or firangis (foreigners), but as kafir (disbeliever) and nasrani (Christians). Some historians have suggested that the impact of British economic and social 'reforms' has been greatly exaggerated, since the Company did not have the resources to enforce them, meaning that away from Calcutta their effect was negligible. Economics Many Indians felt that the company was asking for heavy tax from the locals. This included an increase in the taxation on land. This seems to have been a very important reason for the spread of the rebellion, keeping in view the speed at which the conflagration ignited in many villages in northern India where farmers rushed to get back their unfairly grabbed title deeds. The resumption of tax free land and confiscation of jagirs (the grant or right to locally control land revenue) caused discontent among the jagirdars and zamindars. Dalhousie had also appointed Inam Commission with powers to confiscate land. Several years before the sepoys' mutiny, Lord William Bentinck had attacked several jagirs in western Bengal. He also resumed the practice of tax free lands in some areas. These changes caused widespread resentment not only among the landed aristocracy but also caused great havoc to a larger section of the middle-class people. Lands were confiscated from the landlords and auctioned. Rich people like the merchants and moneylenders were therefore able to speculate in British land sales and drive out the most vulnerable peasant farmers. Sepoys Subadar of the 21st Bengal Native Infantry (1819) During the late eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth century, the armies of the East India Company, in particular those of the Bengal Presidency, were victorious and indomitable ‚Äî the term \\"high noon of the sepoy army\\" has been used by a military historian. The company had an unbroken series of victories in India, against the Marathas, Mysore, north Indian states, and the Gurkhas, later against the Sikhs, and further afield in China and Burma. The company had developed a military organisation where, in theory, fealty of the sepoys to the company was considered the height of \\"izzat\\" or honour, where the European officer replaced the village headman with benevolent figures of authority, and where regiments were mostly recruited from sepoys belonging to the same caste, and community.Mason, Philip (1974), pages 203-204 A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, Unlike the Madras and Bombay Armies of the BEIC, which were far more diverse, the Bengal Army recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning Bhumihars and Rajputs of the Ganges Valley. Though paid marginally less than the Bombay and Madras Presidency troops, there was a tradition of trust between the soldiery and the establishment ‚Äî the soldiers felt needed and that the company would care for their welfare. The soldiers performed well on the field of battle in exchange for which they were rewarded with symbolic heraldic rewards such as battle honours in addition to the extra pay or \\"batta\\" (foreign pay) routinely disbursed for operations committed beyond the established borders of Company rule.Mason, Philip (1974), page 190 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, Until the 1840s there had been a widespread belief amongst the Bengal sepoys in the iqbal or continued good fortune of the East India Company. However much of this sense of the invincibility of the British was lost in the First Anglo-Afghan War where poor political judgement and inept British leadership led to the massacre of Elphinstone's army (which included three Bengal regiments) while retreating from Kabul. When the mood of the sepoys turned against their masters, they remembered Kabul and that the British were not invincible.Mason, Philip (1974), page 225 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, Caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army were not merely tolerated but encouraged in the early years of the company's rule. Partly owing to this, Bengal sepoys were not subject to the penalty of flogging as were the European soldiers. This meant that when they came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta, from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status, and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted. If the caste of high-caste sepoys was considered to be \\"polluted\\", they would have to expend considerable sums of money on ritual purification before being accepted back into society.Mason, Philip (1974), page 226 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, There had been earlier indications that all was not well in the armies of the East India Company. As early as 1806, concerns that the sepoys' caste may be polluted had led to the Vellore Mutiny, which was brutally suppressed. In 1824, there was another mutiny by a regiment ordered overseas in the First Anglo-Burmese War, who were refused transport to carry individual cooking vessels and told to share communal pots. Eleven of the sepoys were executed and hundreds more sentenced to hard labour. In 1851-2 sepoys who were required to serve in the Second Anglo-Burmese War also refused to embark, but were merely sent to serve elsewhere.Mason, Philip (1974), page 264 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, The pay of the sepoy was relatively low and after Awadh and the Punjab were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (batta or bhatta) if posted there, because this was no longer considered \\"foreign service\\". Since the batta made the difference between active service being considered munificent or burdensome, the sepoys repeatedly resented and actively opposed inconsiderate unilateral changes in pay and batta ordered by the Military Audit department. Prior to the period of British rule, any refusal to proceed on service until pay issues were resolved was considered a legitimate form of displaying grievance by Indian troops serving under Indian rulers. Such measures were considered a valid negotiating tactic by the sepoys, likely to be repeated every time such issues arose. In contrast to their Indian predecessors, the British considered such refusals at times to be outright \\"mutinies\\" and therefore to be suppressed brutally. At other times however the Company directly or indirectly conceded the legitimacy of the sepoy's demands, such as when troops of the Bengal and Madras armies refused to serve in Sindh without batta after its conquest.Mason, Philip (1974), pages 226-228 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, Bengal Army sepoys considered the transfer of the numeral 66th from a regular battalion of Bengal Native Infantry, disbanded over refusal to serve without batta, to the 66th Regiment of Gurkhas (seen here in native costume) as a breach of faith by the East India Company. The varying stances of the British government, the reduction of allowances and harsh punishments, contributed to a feeling amongst the troops that the Company no longer cared for them. Certain actions of the government, such as increased recruitment of Sikhs and Gurkhas, peoples considered by the Bengal sepoys to be inferior in caste to them, increased the distrust of the sepoys who thought that this was a sign of their services not being needed any more. The transfer of the number 66th which was taken away from a regular Bengal Sepoy regiment of the line disbanded over refusal to serve without batta, and given to a Gurkha battalion, was considered by the Sepoy as a breach of faith by the company.Mason, Philip (1974), page 236 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, At the beginning of the nineteenth century, British officers were generally closely involved with their troops, speaking Indian languages fluently; participating in local culture through such practices as having regimental flags and weapons blessed by Brahman priests; and frequently having native mistresses. Later, the attitudes of British officers changed with increased intolerance, lack of involvement and unconcern of the welfare of troops becoming manifest more and more. Sympathetic rulers, such as Lord William Bentinck were replaced by arrogant aristocrats, such as Lord Dalhousie, who despised the troops and the populace. As time passed, the powers of the commanding officers reduced and the government became more unfeeling or distant from the concerns of the sepoys.Mason, Philip (1974), pages 186 and 313 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, Officers of an evangelical persuasion in the company's Army (such as Herbert Edwardes and Colonel S.G. Wheler of the 34th Bengal Infantry) had taken to preaching to their Sepoys in the hope of converting them to Christianity. The General Services Enlistment Act of 1856 required new recruits to serve overseas, if asked. The serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that this requirement would be eventually extended to them, violating observance of the Kala Pani prohibition on sea travel. Thus, the Hindu soldiers viewed the Act as a potential threat to their faith. In 1857, the Bengal Army contained 10 regular regiments of Indian cavalry and 74 of infantry. All of the Bengal Native Cavalry regiments and 45 of the infantry units rebelled at some point. Following the disarming and disbandment of an additional seventeen Bengal Native Infantry regiments, which were suspected of planning mutiny, only twelve survived to serve in the new post-mutiny army. Once the first rebellions took place, it was clear to most British commanders that the grievances which led to them were felt throughout the Bengal army and no Indian unit could wholly be trusted, although many officers continued to vouch for their men's loyalty, even in the face of captured correspondence indicating their intention to rebel.Mason, Philip (1974), pages 291-292 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, The Bengal Army also administered, sometimes loosely, 29 regiments of irregular horse and 42 of irregular infantry. Some of these units belonged to states allied to the British or recently absorbed into British-administered territory, and of these, two large contingents from the states of Awadh and Gwalior readily joined the growing rebellion. Other irregular units were raised in frontier areas from communities such as Assamese or Pashtuns to maintain order locally. Few of these participated in the rebellion, and one contingent in particular (the recently raised Punjab Irregular Force) actively participated on the British side.Mason, Philip (1974), pages 305-306 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, The Bengal Army also contained three \\"European\\" regiments of infantry and many artillery units manned by white personnel. Due to the need for technical specialists, the artillery units generally had a higher proportion of British personnel. Although the armies of many Rajas or states which rebelled contained large numbers of guns, the British superiority in artillery was to be decisive in the siege of Delhi after the arrival of a siege train of thirty-two howitzers and mortars.Saul, David (2003), page 294 \\"The Indian Mutiny\\", Penguin Books, There were also a number of regiments from the British Army (referred to in India as \\"Queen's troops\\") stationed in India, but in 1857 several of these had been withdrawn to take part in the Crimean War or the Anglo-Persian War of 1856. The moment at which the sepoys' grievances led them openly to defy British authority also happened to be the most favourable opportunity to do so.Mason, Philip (1974), page 263 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", London: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston, The Enfield Rifle Sepoys throughout India were issued with a new rifle, the Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled musket‚Äîa more powerful and accurate weapon than the old but smoothbore Brown Bess they had been using for the previous decades. The rifling inside the musket barrel ensured accuracy at much greater distances than was possible with old muskets. One thing did not change in this new weapon ‚Äî the loading process, which did not improve significantly until the introduction of breech loaders and metallic, one-piece cartridges a few decades later. To load both the old musket and the new rifle, soldiers had to bite the cartridge open and pour the gunpowder it contained into the rifle's muzzle, then stuff the paper cartridge (overlaid with a thin mixture of beeswax and mutton tallow for waterproofing) into the musket as wadding, the ball being secured to the top of the cartridge and guided into place for ramming down the muzzle. The rifle's cartridges contained 68 grains of FF blackpowder, and the ball was typically a 530-grain Pritchett or a Burton-Mini√© ball. Many sepoys believed that the cartridges that were standard issue with the new rifle were greased with lard (pork fat) which was regarded as unclean by Muslims and tallow (cow fat) which angered the Hindus as cows were equal to a goddess to them. The sepoys' British officers dismissed these claims as rumours, and suggested that the sepoys make a batch of fresh cartridges, and greased these with pig and cow fat. This reinforced the belief that the original issue cartridges were indeed greased with lard and tallow. Another suggestion they put forward was to introduce a new drill, in which the cartridge was not bitten with the teeth but torn open with the hand. The sepoys rejected this, pointing out that they might very well forget and bite the cartridge, not surprising given the extensive drilling that allowed 19th century British and Indian troops to fire three to four rounds per minute. British and Indian military drills of the time required soldiers to bite off the end of the Beeswax paper cartridge, pour the gunpowder contained within down the barrel, stuff the remaining paper cartridge into the barrel, ram the paper cartridge (which included the ball wrapped and tied in place) down the barrel, remove the ram-rod, return the ram-rod, bring the rifle to the ready, set the sights, add a percussion cap, present the rifle, and fire. The musketry books also recommended that, \\"Whenever the grease around the bullet appears to be melted away, or otherwise removed from the cartridge, the sides of the bullet should be wetted in the mouth before putting it into the barrel; the saliva will serve the purpose of grease for the time being\\" This meant that biting a musket cartridge was second nature to the Sepoys, some of whom had decades of service in the company's army, and who had been doing musket drill for every day of their service. The first sepoy who rebelled by aiming his loaded weapon at a British officer was Mangal Pandey who was later executed. Prophecies, omens, signs and rumours There was rumour about an old prophecy that the company's rule would end after a hundred years. This took the form of Muslim millenarianism, with preachers in Lucknow foretelling the end of the raj. In some districts like Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur, Bose and Jalal argue that \\"the revolt took on a distinctly millenarian flavour.\\" Their rule in India had begun with the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Before the rebellion, there were reports that \\"holy men\\" were mysteriously circulating chapatis and lotus flowers among the sepoys. Leader of the British Conservative Party and future prime minister Benjamin Disraeli argued these objects were signs to rebel and evidence of a conspiracy, and the press echoed this belief. After the rebellion, there was rumour in Britain that Russia was responsible.

The Muslim insurgency remains locked in military stalemate against Soviet and Afghan troops. The government controls the cities, while the guerrillas control the countryside. There are conflicting reports on the success of the regime in either neutralizing the insurgency movement or crushing it with the aid of some 110,000 Soviet troops. Reports on the war are sketchy and probably biased, since they are based on accounts given either by Pakistan-based rebel groups or by journalists taken on conducted tours by the government. President Karmal is firmly in command of the ruling PDPA. Infighting between the Parcham and Khalq factions of the party is less evident in 1983 than in previous years, and it appears that the Soviets have succeeded in bringing them under control.

June 24, 1983 Seven days of talks sponsored by the UN on the withdrawal of Soviet troops end in Geneva with no sign of major progress on the issue. The talks were conducted by a UN negotiator who met separately and alternately with delegates from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan was involved in the talks because an estimated three million Afghan refugees had crossed into its territory and because the Soviet Union asserted that Pakistan was the main supporter of the Mujahideen and the major channel through which arms reached them. Iran, which by its own estimate houses 1.5 million Afghan refugees, boycotted the talks because it believed that no negotiations should be undertaken without the participation of the guerrillas.

Resistance against the Soviet-backed government increases sharply during the year. Afghanistan continues to be dependent on the U.S.S.R. for military aid, food supplies, fuel, and even medical treatment for its leaders. Afghanistan's relations with the West remain strained, and its relations with Asian nations, with the exception of India, show no visible improvement. After five years of Soviet military presence, the nation is slowly but steadily becoming a satellite of Moscow. Incumbents * President: Babrak Karmal * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand January 1, 1984 New draft laws are proclaimed under which all Afghan youths over 18 years of age are to be conscripted into the Army. The move is seen as part of a desperate attempt to check the depletion of the Army, which has fallen to 30,000-40,000 personnel from 80,000-90,000 before the Soviet invasion. January 2, 1984 The U.S.S.R. rejects a UN resolution demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. The resolution, which did not name the U.S.S.R. directly, was co-sponsored by 44 countries and adopted in the General Assembly the previous November. January 10, 1984 Heavy fighting is reported from Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city. According to some sources, over 100 troops are killed in the operation, but the city remains under insurgent control. The Afghan media denies these reports. February 1, 1984 Radio Kabul claims successes against the insurgents, reporting that 600 \\"bandits\\" - the official term for insurgents - have been killed during January. April and July 1984 In the continuing battle for control of the strategic Panjsher Valley near Kabul, the government launches major offensives, claiming on each occasion that it has cleared the valley of rebels, though the claim is disputed by Western diplomats and by subsequent events. Independent reports put casualties among Soviet and Afghan troops during the July 18‚Äì24 offensive at 2,000, with the insurgents and valley residents suffering equally. July 9‚ÄìAugust 3, 1984 Karmal is in Moscow for \\"medical treatment\\". July and August 1984 Pakistan claims that air and artillery attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan have killed some 100 people. The allegation is promptly denied by Kabul, but Pakistan-based foreign journalists taken on a tour of the affected areas confirm the attacks. The affair heats up when the U.S. State Department issues a statement on August 24 \\"deploring the attacks on Pakistan\\". Late August 1984 The most important diplomatic development of the year takes place in Geneva, where talks are held under UN auspices. Afghan Foreign Minister Dost and his Pakistani counterpart Khan do not meet face to face but hold negotiations through Cordovez. Nothing concrete emerges from the talks, however; UN officials refuse to comment, except to say privately that another round of discussions will be held later, possibly in 1985. The three main items under discussions are international guarantees of Afghanistan's security, the return to Afghanistan of the approximately 4.5 million refugees from Pakistan and Iran, and withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan. August 31, 1984 A bomb explodes outside the international airport at Kabul, killing 13 people and wounding 207. Karmal accuses Pakistan of masterminding the incident. November 1984 Western diplomats say the Soviets are sending Afghan children to the Soviet Union for ten years of indoctrination. However, there is no independent confirmation of the report.

The foreign ministers do not meet directly, since to do so would amount to recognition by Pakistan of Karmal's regime. Iran once again boycotts the talks but is kept informed. The last round of talks adjourns on December 19 to allow the parties to study new UN proposals. Earlier, the U.S. announced its willingness to act as guarantor of a settlement that would involve Soviet troop withdrawal and an end to U.S. aid to the guerrillas.

The hotel received its namesake from the thermal spring lakes on the property, and operated as a luxury resort and sanitorium during the turn of the century, advertising the medicinal attributes of the mineral water and drawing visitors worldwide. It is also the first known commercial building in the world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source. After a fire burned down over half of the hotel in 1934, the remaining building was used for various purposes, including a retirement home, asylum, and a nurse's training school during World War II. After that, operations were intermittent under various owners before the building's abandonment in 1991. The hotel and surrounding structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Today, it is operated as a bed and breakfast, museum, and spa. Prior owners included future governor Walter M. Pierce and former state senator Parish L. Willis.Clarke Woodward Drug Co. v. Hot Lake Sanatorium Co., 88 Ore. 284, 169 P. 796 (1918). West Publishing Company. Background A portion of Hot Lake, as viewed from the hotel grounds The hot springs that make up Hot Lake themselves rest at the foot of a large bluff, and were often used by Native Americans before settlement and colonization occurred in the area; the lake was named \\"Ea-Kesh-Pa\\" by the Nez Perce. It is thought by historians that Hot Lake was one of the first thermal springs to be visited by European settlers, and the springs themselves were documented by Washington Irving in his recording of Robert Stuart's explorations during the Astor Expedition in 1812. Irving wrote in his record: > Emerging from the chain of Blue Mountains, they descended upon a vast plain, > almost a dead level, sixty miles in circumference, of excellent soil ... In > traversing this plain, they passed, close to the skirt of the hills, a great > pool of water, three hundred yards in circumference, fed by a sulphur > spring, about ten feet in diameter, boiling up in one corner. The place was > much frequented by elk, which were found in considerable numbers in the > adjacent mountains, and their horns, shed in the spring-time, were strewed > in every direction around the pond. After the Oregon Trail expedition brought settlers into the area, the land surrounding the lakes was utilized as a cattle ranch, and was purchased by a sailor named Tommy Atkins. An apocryphal story claiming that Atkins was cured of numerous health ailments after falling into the spring was published in The Oregonian in 1914 in a piece detailing the hotel's history. The lake's spring bubbles nearly a half-million gallons of water each day, and the average temperature of the lake is around 200¬∞F (93¬∞C). History 1864‚Äì1906: Initial construction In 1864, Samuel Fitzgerald Newhart, a native of California, arrived in the Grande Ronde Valley, and constructed the original wooden structure on the lake, which faced toward the bluff rather than outward toward the lake. The structure was similar to the contents of a modern-day shopping mall, containing a post office, blacksmith, dance hall, barber shop, bath house, and several other businesses. By 1884, the Union Pacific Railroad commenced its construction, running near Hot Lake. In 1903, the original wooden structure was demolished, and construction began on a new hotel and various bath houses. Dr. Phy became involved with the project in 1904, and a brick structure intended for use as a hospital began construction. 1907‚Äì1933: Heyday An original examination table used in the hotel hospital Well-renowned architect John V. Bennes of nearby Baker City has been attributed to the architectural design of the building, reminiscent of the Colonial era; Bennes also designed numerous buildings on the Oregon State University campus, as well as several buildings in Portland. In 1908, the main brick wing of the hotel was completed, which alone comprised 65,000 square feet. The construct featured a Georgian-style U-shape with a solarium facing the bluff. The building was heated with the geothermal waters, and was the first known commercial property in the world to use geothermal heating. Upon its re-opening, the hotel housed a total of 105 guest rooms, a 60-bed surgical ward, a ballroom, a barber shop, confectionery, drug store, news stand, reception rooms, laboratories, and a commissary. The hospital featured state- of-the-art soaking tubs supplied by the lake water, as well as an operating room complete with an elevated observation deck, and a 1,500-guest dance hall. The hotel came to be known by locals as \\"The Town Under One Roof,\\" and was a mostly self-sufficient property, producing its own vegetables, dairy products, meats, and eggs. In 1910, the hotel grossed $178,811 in yearly revenue, and the use of the building's geothermal heating system reportedly saved $15,000 per year in heating costs. In 1911, a show barn was built on the property, and in 1912, the Central Railroad of Oregon built a line from Richmond directly to the hotel, which marked the beginning of the building's heyday. In 1917, Dr. W.T. Phy purchased the hotel and resort, renaming it \\"Hot Lake Sanitorium\\". The building was from then on known not only as a resort for the rich, but also as a hospital for the ill; the geothermal mineral waters from the springs were used and experimented with to help treat patients and guests, making the resort a pioneering figure in western experimental medicine. By 1924, the hotel had become a major tourist attraction, attracting visitors worldwide. The Mayo brothers, founders of the Mayo Clinic, were frequent visitors to the hotel, as well as Wild Bill Hickok. Staffing fifteen nurses, four physicians, an X-ray technician, and a bacteriologist, the hotel garnered a reputation as \\"The Mayo Clinic of the West.\\" A promotional advertisement from the Oregon Pacific Railroad promoted the purported healing properties of the waters, stating: > [Hot Lake Hotel] is the largest, hottest, and most curative springs known; > best bathing facilities, most courteous attendants; first-class medical and > surgical conveniences; finest operating room in the west; steam heat, > electric lights; hot and cold water throughout the building Other advertisements touted the drinking of the water as relieving a variety of ailments, as well as claiming mud baths and poultice made with lake sediment as being beneficial for treatment of rheumatism. 1934‚Äì1990: Fire and decline Hot Lake Hotel in the aftermath of the 1934 fire Dr. Phy, the central manager and owner of the property, died in 1931 of pneumonia. On May 7, 1934, a fire destroyed the majority of the building's west wing, completely demolishing the wood structures of the hotel; the brick portion of the building, however, survived the fire. Prior to the fire, the building had contained nearly 300 rooms and dining areas for over 1,000 guests prior to the fire. From then on, business at the hotel declined, and eventually the hospital area on the third floor was the only functioning business. A flight school and nurse's training center was established at the hotel in 1939 during World War II, and U.S. Route 30 was later built, with Oregon Route 203 branching off of it and running right by the front of the hotel grounds. In 1941, the property was acquired by A.J. Roth, and was converted into a nursing home for the aged in 1951, and later an asylum. The building functioned as the asylum and rest home until 1974 when ownership of the building changed, and a short-lived restaurant and night club was opened, which operated unsuccessfully for two years; rumors of hauntings plagued the building from the late 1970s onward. In the mid-1980s, Dr. Lyle Griffith purchased the property and used one corner of the hotel as a bath house; by 1991, the bath house closed down, and the hotel was abandoned, falling prey to local vandals and the elements; however, an RV park constructed in 1989 operated adjacent to the hotel. 1991‚Äì2002: Abandonment The building sat abandoned and decrepit for over a fifteen-year period, in spite of having been purchased by the Seattle-based B.B.R. Holdings corporation. Various stories circulated concerning reported hauntings in the hotel‚Äî it has been rumored to be haunted by vacationers, a gardener who committed suicide, and residents who lived in the building during its use as an insane asylum. When the hotel was originally constructed it acquired a piano formerly owned by Robert E. Lee's wife, which was said to play all by itself up on the third floor. Other reports of screaming and crying were reported by owner Donna Pattee and caretaker Richard Owens coming from the hospital's surgery room, as well as rocking chairs moving at their own accord; Pattee and her husband owned the property in the 1970s when it was a restaurant; both they and Owens lived on the second floor of the building at the time. Local rumors and legend concerning the hotel were pervasive, and in 2001 the property was featured on the ABC documentary series The Scariest Places on Earth. 2003‚Äìpresent: Restoration In 2003, the building, which was literally falling apart, was purchased from Charles and Louise Rhea by David Manuel. Restoration began soon after; the building was greatly dilapidated, with all 368 windows broken and/or missing, and a sparsely-remaining roof. After two years of construction, it was opened to the public for tours in 2005, while individual guest rooms were still being sponsored and renovated. In 2008, the west wing of the building collapsed. As of 2010, the building now functions as a bed and breakfast, with dozens of restored rooms, a spa, restaurant, and a museum. The hotel's original pool was covered with landscape, but new mineral pools are under construction. The hotel is part of the Hot Lake Resort, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.oregon.gov: Oregon National Register List In culture In addition to its appearance on The Scariest Places on Earth, the hotel was also used as a shooting location for a music video by musician Laura Gibson.

McAfee acquired the company in 2008. The company also developed filtering systems used by governments such as Iran and Saudi Arabia that blocks their citizens from accessing information on the Internet.Snuffing out Net's benefit to democracy, Jim Landers, Dallas Morning News, December 20, 2005; accessed September 20, 2008.Iran targets dissent on the net Clark Boyd, BBC.com, June 24, 2005; accessed September 20, 2008. Company history In 1984, a research group called the Secure Computing Technology Center (SCTC) was formed at Honeywell in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The centerpiece of SCTC was its work on security-evaluated operating systems for the NSA. This work included the Secure Ada Target (SAT) and the Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK), both designed to meet the stringent A1 level of the Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). Over the next several years, Secure Computing morphed from a small defense contractor into a commercial product vendor, largely because the investment community was much less interested in purchasing security goods from defense contractors than from commercial product vendors, especially vendors in the growing Internet space. Secure Computing became a publicly traded company in 1995. Following the pattern of other Internet-related startups, the stock price tripled its first day: it opened at $16 a share and closed at $48. The price peaked around $64 in the next several weeks and then collapsed over the following year or so. It ranged between roughly $3 and $20 afterward until the company was purchased by McAfee. The company headquarters were moved to San Jose, California, in 1998, though the bulk of the workforce remained in the Twin Cities. The Roseville employees completed a move to St. Paul, Minnesota, in February 2006. Several other sites now exist, largely the result of mergers. Mergers and acquisitions Secure Computing consisted of several merged units, one of the oldest being Enigma Logic, Inc., which was started around 1982. Bob Bosen, the founder, claims to have created the first security token to provide challenge- response authentication. Bosen published a computer game for the TRS-80 home computer in 1979, called 80 Space Raiders, that used a simple challenge response mechanism for copy protection. People who used the mechanism encouraged him to repackage it for remote authentication. Bosen started Enigma Logic to do so, and filed for patents in 1982‚Äì83; a patent was issued in the United Kingdom in 1986. Ultimately, the \\"challenge\\" portion of the challenge response was eliminated to produce a one-time password token similar to the SecurID product. Enigma Logic merged with Secure Computing Corporation in 1996. Secure Computing acquired the SmartFilter product line by purchasing Webster Network Strategies, the producer of the WebTrack product, in 1996.Secure to Buy Webster Network Strategies, May 14, 1996; accessed April 22, 2014. The acquisition included the domain name webster.com, which was eventually sold to the publishers of Webster's Dictionary. Shortly after acquiring the Webster/SmartFilter product, Secure Computing merged with Border Network Technologies, a Canadian company selling the Borderware firewall. Border Network Technologies boasted an excellent product and a highly developed set of sales channels; some said that the sales channels were a major inducement for the merger. Although the plan was to completely merge the Borderware product with Sidewinder, and to offer a single product to existing users of both products, this never quite succeeded. In 1998, the Borderware business unit was sold to a new company, Borderware Technologies Inc., formed by one of the original Borderware founders. By this time, the mergers had yielded a highly distributed company with offices in Minnesota, Florida, California, and two or three in Ontario. This proved unwieldy, and the company scaled back to offices in Minnesota and California. In 2002, the company took over the Gauntlet Firewall product from Network Associates. In 2003, Secure Computing acquired N2H2, the makers of the Bess web filtering package. There has been some consolidation of Bess and SmartFilter, and Bess is now referred to as \\"Smartfilter, Bess edition\\" in company literature. An acquisition of CyberGuard was announced in August 2005 and approved in January 2006. (A year earlier, CyberGuard had attempted to acquire Secure Computing, but the proposal had been rejected). This was the largest merger by Secure Computing at the time and resulted in the addition of several product lines, including three classes of firewalls, content and protocol filtering systems, and an enterprise-wide management system for controlling all of those products. Several offices were also added, including CyberGuard's main facility in Deerfield Beach, Florida, as well as the Webwasher development office in Paderborn, Germany, and a SnapGear development office in Brisbane, Australia. In 2006, the company merged with Atlanta-based CipherTrust, a developer of email security solutions. The merger was announced in July 2006 and completed in August 2006. On July 30, 2008, Secure Computing announced its intention to sell the SafeWord authentication product line to Aladdin Knowledge Systems, leaving the company with a business focused on web/mail security and firewalls. The sale was concluded later that year. On September 22, 2008, McAfee announced its intention to acquire Secure Computing. The acquisition was completed not long afterwards, and the combined company formed the world's largest dedicated security company at the time. Products TrustedSource reputation system TrustedSource, a reputation system that Secure Computing obtained as part of the CipherTrust acquisition, was a key technology for the company, enabling all product lines with global intelligence capability based on behavioral analysis of traffic patterns from all of company's email, web and firewall devices and hosted services, as well as those of numerous OEM partners. TrustedSource derived real-time reputation scores of IPs, URLs, domains, and mail/web content based on a variety of data mining/analysis techniques, such as Support Vector Machine, Random forest, and Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency (TFIDF) classifiers. Web security The company's flagship web security product line was the Secure Web appliance (formerly known as Webwasher). It provided Anti-Malware protection, TrustedSource reputation-enabled URL filtering controls, content caching, and SSL scanning capabilities. In June 2008, Secure Computing launched Secure Web Protection Service, an in-the-cloud hosted web security service that provided a similar set of features to the Secure Web appliance, without requiring any on-premises equipment or software. Mail security The company's flagship email security product line was the Secure Mail appliance (formerly known as IronMail). It provided TrustedSource reputation-enabled anti-spam, data- leakage protection (DLP), encryption and anti-malware capabilities. Secure firewalls The company's flagship firewall product, formerly known as Sidewinder,Dan Thomsen and Winn Schwartau, \\"Is Your Network Secure? Securing your corporate network while connecting to the Internet doesn't have to be difficult. Just start with a good foundation\\", Byte, January 1996, archived June 23, 2008. was renamed McAfee Firewall Enterprise; McAfee sold Sidewinder to Forcepoint in January 2016.\\"Acquisition of Stonesoft (McAfee Next Generation Firewall) and Sidewinder (McAfee Firewall Enterprise)\\" , January 2016 Over the years, Secure Computing (and its antecedent organizations) has offered the following major lines of firewall products: * Firewall Enterprise (Sidewinder) ‚Äì historically based on SecureOS, the company's derivative of BSDi (previously BSD/OS), but later based on FreeBSD. * Secure Firewall Reporter * Secure Firewall CommandCenter * CyberGuard ** Secure SnapGear ‚Äì embedded system based on ŒºClinux ** Classic ‚Äì built on UnixWare ** TSP (Total Stream Protection) ‚Äì built on Linux * Borderware ‚Äì sold off, as noted previously * SecureZone ‚Äì discontinued * Firewall for NT ‚Äì discontinued * Gauntlet ‚Äì built on Solaris, nearly phased out The Sidewinder firewall incorporated technical features of the high-assurance LOCK system, including Type enforcement, a technology later applied in SELinux. However, interaction between Secure Computing and the open source community was spotty due to the company's ownership of patents related to Type enforcement. The Sidewinder never really tried to achieve an A1 TCSEC rating, but it did earn an EAL-4+ Common Criteria rating. Along with Sidewinder, Gauntlet had been one of the earliest application layer firewalls; both had developed a large customer base in the United States Department of Defense. Gauntlet was originally developed by Trusted Information Systems (TIS) as a commercial version of the TIS Firewall Toolkit, an early open source firewall package developed under a DARPA contract. Use of company products for governmental censorship The OpenNet Initiative studied filtering software used by governments to block access by their citizens and found Secure Computing's SmartFilter program heavily used by both the Iranian and Saudi governments. According to Secure Computing, any use of its software in Iran is without its consent‚ÄîU.S. sanctions prohibit American companies from any dealings with Iran‚Äîand in 2005 the company said it is actively working to stop its illegal use.Iranian net censorship powered by US technology, Will Knight, New Scientist, June 27, 2005; accessed September 20, 2008.Secure Computing Tries to Block Illegal Downloads in Iran, K.C.

In response to the company, Jonathan Zittrain, co-director of Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, stated, \\"[T]he fact remains that the software has been in use for an extended period of time there. And we've seen Secure Computing software turn up in more than just Iran.

Lee, November 19, 2001; accessed September 20, 2008. The company already had a deal with the Saudis that was due to expire in 2003. In its defense, Secure Computing has always stated that it cannot control how customers use a product once it has been sold. According to the OpenNet Initiative's 2007 report, the Saudi government's censorship \\"most extensively covers religious and social content, though sites relating to opposition groups and regional political and human rights issues are also targeted.\\"Saudi Arabia country profile, OpenNet Initiative, May 10, 2007; accessed September 20, 2008.

Early years Holiday was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in Manhattan. Her father, a burlesque entertainer who was the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, changed his name from Allen Zaslawsky to Allen Zee before his daughters were born. She attended Public School 117 in Jamaica, Queens, and then went to Forest Hills High School. Hoping to become a star, she dropped out of high school and sang at the Copacabana nightclub. Her father was also described by Ed Sullivan as a \\"Capitol Theater exec.\\" Her mother, Doris, worked in the production department at radio station WHN in New York City. Her father at one time was night manager of WHN. She has an older sister, Judy, whose stage name was Judy Sinclair. Name change A column in the June 30, 1954, issue of the Brooklyn Eagle noted Zee's change of names: \\"At the Guy Lombardo extravaganza, 'Arabian Night,' the lassie that almost walked away with the show was Hope Holiday. Hope, before this show, used the name of Hope Zee ...\\" She later recalled: > I had a featured role as the Teeny Weeny Genie and got to sing two songs. > Before this show I had been billed as \\"Hope Zee,\\" but since my father was a > producer of the show along with Lombardo, he purposely changed my name in > the program, as he didn't want audiences thinking there was any nepotism > imvolved. I literally had no say in choosing my new name. Since he loved > Judy Holliday, Daddy decided to call me \\"Hope Holiday\\" without the extra > \\"L.\\" I hated the name at first but ending up keeping it. Career Stage Holiday has extensive Broadway musical comedy background, beginning with dancing in the chorus lines in Top Banana and Guys and Dolls. As Hope Zee, she also was understudy to Rose Marie in Top Banana, but when the star had to be gone for a week, Zee was laid off, and Audrey Meadows was hired to take over the part. In 1949, she played Fifi and was a member of the singing ensemble of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. In the 1956 Broadway production of Li'l Abner,, Holiday was understudy for Mammy Yokum in addition to being a featured dancer. Film Holiday acted in 1960s, 1970s and 1980s film and TV. She has also produced and directed films. Singing In the early 1950s, Holiday (billed as Hope Zee) sang with Ralph Flanagan's orchestra. An August 4, 1950, newspaper column by Dorothy Kilgallen reported, \\"Hope Zee ... quit 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' last week to become vocalist with Ralph Flanagan's band ...\\" Personal life Holiday is the widow of actor Frank Marth.

Biography James Butler was born to Richard Butler and Sybella Butler, a couple who had emigrated from Grendon Underwood to Adelaide in 1881. Richard Butler was an umbrella maker, cutlery sharpener of scissors and knives, and china restorer by trade, and established a shop in the Adelaide Arcade. James joined his father and the family traded as Richard Butler and Sons. James and his wife Hanna had five children; Rowland, Clifford, Colin, Verna and Ruth. Rowland (1905‚Äì1971) was a missionary to China with the China Inland Mission in 1928. Around the turn of the century Butler attended Angas College, an evangelical college that had been modeled on Moody Bible Institute and influenced by missionary Hudson Taylor. In 1905 James‚Äô sister Laura married Sam Barrett, also a graduate of Angas College. Butler and Barrett became close friends, thoroughly committed to the evangelical cause. When Angas College closed in 1920, and prospects for the recently begun Chapman- Alexander Bible Institute looked dim, Butler and Barrett resolved to establish the Adelaide Bible Institute, classes for which began in 1924. The two continued as joint superintendents until the establishment of a residential college at Payneham in 1949.

History Formerly called the Adelaide Bible Institute, the college was established in 1924 and offered evening classes to train people for missionary service. In 1949, the college became residential, first at West Richmond before moving in 1950 to Payneham. It was at this time that the college began to provide full-time ministry training programs. Growing numbers of students meant that, in 1962, the college relocated to larger premises in Victor Harbor where the Reverend Geoffrey Bingham became principal and oversaw a continued increase in the student body. The college was renamed the Bible College of South Australia in 1973 and, in 1978, the strategic decision was made to move back to the city. The former Concordia College girls' boarding house in Malvern was acquired and continues to be the college's home today. In the 1980s, the college was a member of the Adelaide College of Divinity along with the Baptist Burleigh College In the 1990s, the college with Burleigh offered the Australian College of Theology Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Ministry degrees. At the end of that decade, they established the South Australian Graduate School of Theology to teach masters and doctoral degrees in addition to undergraduate awards. In 2007, following the closure of Burleigh, the graduate school was amalgamated into the college proper where the full range of academic programs are now still offered. Courses The college offers tertiary qualifications from diploma to postgraduate level, focussing on the Bachelor of Ministry, Bachelor of Theology and Master of Divinity, these three being commonly recognised as standard qualifications for workers in churches and Christian ministries. All courses at the college emphasise New Testament and Old Testament studies with the disciplines of Christian thought (e.g. systematic theology, Church history and ethics) and ministry practice (e.g. preaching, leadership and evangelism) also being offered. Courses are taught on-campus by a small in-house faculty and several adjunct lecturers. Several of the Master of Arts units are run in intensive blocks by visiting lecturers.

Gracchus (fl. 237 BC; dead by 215 BC), a Roman Republican consul in the year 238 BC, was the first man from his branch (stirps) of the family (the gens Sempronia) to become consul; several other plebeian Sempronii had already reached the consulship and even the censorship. He is best known as the father of the similarly named consul of 215 and 213 BC, and the grandfather of Tiberius Gracchus Major, and the great-grandfather of the Brothers Gracchi (Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus). Tiberius Gracchus had a relatively undistinguished consulship, with an indecisive campaign in Sardinia (Livy), after which he apparently vowed to dedicate a temple, not completed in his lifetime. That temple was completed and dedicated by his elder son, Tiberius, the consul of 215 BC and 213 BC. His co-consul, the patrician consul, was Publius Valerius Q. f. Falto. Family and descendants Tiberius Gracchus was the father of at least two sons by an unknown wife: * Tiberius Sempronius Ti. f. Ti. n. Gracchus, consul 215 BC and 213 BC (killed in ambush 212 BC), who was curule aedile in 216 BC, then chosen Master of the Horse by the dictator Marcus Junius Pera, and then twice elected consul. He was an able consul, and known as an effective general of volunteer slave troops after the defeat at Cannae. His death in an ambush in 212 BC deprived him of further advancement; due to his popularity with the People and Senate alike, he would almost certainly have become Censor. The elder son was father of at least one son, and possibly two surviving sons. ** Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus who was elected to the priesthood in 203 BC at a very young age, and who died in the plague of 174 BC. ** (probable) Tiberius Veturius Gracchus Sempronianus who replaced his dead kinsman as Augur, and whose name indicates that he was born a Sempronius and adopted into the patrician Veturii. * Publius Sempronius Ti. f. Ti. n. Gracchus, of whom almost nothing is known. He had married and fathered a son Tiberius Gracchus Major by 217 BC, and may have died during the Second Punic War. ** Tiberius Gracchus Major (c. 217 BC-154 BC), who married Scipio's younger daughter, and whose sons became famous as two reformist tribunes of the plebs who were undone by their conservative Opposition (some of them closely related). *** Sempronia, wife and widow of her mother's cousin Scipio Aemilianus; no issue. *** Tiberius Gracchus (c. 168 BC- 133 BC, killed in a riot by conservative Senators), his three sons all died young; and *** Gaius Gracchus (154 BC-121 BC, committed suicide). Other possible descendants * The tribune of the plebs Publius Sempronius Gracchus who attacked Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC) and others for corrupt practices and forced him to withdraw his candidacy for censor, may have been another grandson, but this is not certain. * A late first-century BC descendant may have been the Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus who was condemned to exile on an island for being Julia's lover.

Early years Tobin was born in New York City on November 29, 1899. Her father, Thomas Tobin, a bank clerk who later became a racetrack bookmaker, was born in Nova Scotia, Canada and her mother, Genevieve, was born in Washington, D.C. She had a sister, Vivian, and a brother, George. Career Tobin made her film debut in 1910 in Uncle Tom's Cabin as Eva. Her stage debut came in 1912 in Disraeli. She appeared in a few films as a child and formed a double act with her sister Vivian. Their brother, George, also had a brief acting career. Following her education in Paris and New York, Tobin concentrated on a stage career in New York. Although she was seen most often in comedies, she also played the role of Cordelia in a Broadway production of King Lear in 1923. Popular with audiences, she was often praised by critics for her appearance and style rather than for her talent, but in 1929, she achieved a significant success in the play Fifty Million Frenchmen. She introduced and popularized the Cole Porter song \\"You Do Something to Me\\", and the success of the role led her back to Hollywood, where she performed regularly in comedy films from the early 1930s. She played prominent supporting roles opposite such performers as Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Claudette Colbert, Joan Blondell, and Kay Francis, but occasionally played starring roles, in films such as Golden Harvest (1933) and Easy to Love (1934). She played secretary Della Street to Warren William's Perry Mason in The Case of the Lucky Legs (1935). One of her most successful performances was as a bored housewife in the drama The Petrified Forest (1936), starring Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart.

Odo was, if the onomastics are correct, a son (or maybe a nephew) of Christian (d. 950), a Saxon count in the Nordth√ºringgau and Schwabengau of Eastphalia. Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda (d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast marca Geronis in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river. Odo's share (outlined) of the marca Geronis (green), 19th century reconstruction In 965, Margrave Gero died and his great marca Geronis was divided into five smaller marches. Count Thietmar, a known son of Hidda, and Odo inherited large parts of his march: Odo received the so- called marca Orientalis or Eastern March, stretching from the Gau Serimunt in the west up to the remotest outposts on the B√≥br river in the east, while Thietmar appeared as margrave of southern Meissen after 970. Both are buried at Nienburg Abbey, a foundation of Thietmar and his brother Archbishop Gero of Cologne, which too provides evidence of their probable relationship. As a young man, Margrave Odo had shared the tutorship of Otto's son (later Otto II) with the boy's step-uncle William, Archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop William taught literature and culture; Margrave Odo taught war and legal customs. Odo spent the first years of his rule subduing the Slavic tribes settling in the eastern parts of the Saxon Ostmark. He held comital rights in the gau of Nizizi, comprising the lands between the Mulde, Elbe and Black Elster rivers, and appeared with the title marchio (margrave) only in 974, though he had held further marcher territories (officially as a county) since 965. In that same year (974), Odo was made Count in the Saxon Nordth√ºringgau, still rivalling with Margrave Thietmar. Odo is chiefly known for his quarrels with the Polish duke Mieszko I. The West Slavic Polans had established a state east of the Saxon marches and, aiming to advance into the Pomeranian lands north of the Warta river, had reached an agreement with late Margrave Gero and Emperor Otto I: Mieszko's ducal title was confirmed and the Polans paid a recurring tribute to the emperor, which was collected by Margrave Odo. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, apparently quite gladly, relates that Odo's reputation with Mieszko was such that the duke of Poland \\"would not have dared while wearing his fur coat to enter a house where he knew the margrave to be, or to remain seated when the margrave stood up.\\" When in 972 the Polans again marched for the Baltic trade centre of Wolin, they entered into open conflict with Odo. The margrave, intending to compel Mieszko to pay tribute for the Pomeranian territory between the Oder and Warta rivers, invaded that region. Aged Emperor Otto, engaged in the marriage of his son Otto II with Princess Theophanu at far-off Rome, ordered them to cease until he himself could arbitrate their dispute. However, Odo attacked Mieszko's forces and was defeated on 24 June at the Battle of Cedynia. The belligerents reconciled at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg one year later. In 983, Odo took part in the attempts to suppress the Great Slav Rising of the Polabian Lutici tribes, but was not able to prevent the loss of the Saxon Northern March. He also failed to succeed Thietmar in the Margraviate of Meissen in 979. Odo left a son, Siegfried (d. 1030), who became a monk at Nienburg, but left the monastery on his father's death to claim his inheritance. He did however not prevail against Thietmar's son Gero II, who became Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark in 993. Siegfried again appeared as a count from 1015, when he claimed the Saxon Ostmark from Gero's son Thietmar IV and allied with Duke Mieszko II of Poland in the German-Polish War. Thietmar IV prevailed with the support by Emperor Henry II, but lost the eastern parts of his march to Mieszko II in the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.

It was discovered on 9 December 1928, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the flowering plant Syringa (lilac).  Orbit and classification  Syringa is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the intermediate asteroid belt at a distance of 1.7‚Äì3.5 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,558 days; semi- major axis of 2.63 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.34 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. For a main-belt asteroid, it has a rather high eccentricity. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg on 1 January 1929, three weeks after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Syringa is a Xk-subtype that transitions between the X- and the dark and uncommon K-type asteroids. It has also been characterized as an X-type by Pan- STARRS photometric survey, and as a primitive P-type asteroid by the Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).  Rotation period  In February 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Syringa was obtained from photometric observations at the Calvin‚ÄìRehoboth Observatory in New Mexico, United States. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 5.1547 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.27 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Syringa measures between 19.711 and 24.30 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo between 0.031 and 0.045. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0434 and a diameter of 22.13 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named after a genus of flowering plants, Syringa, of the family Oleaceae. The most common member of Syringa is Syringa vulgaris (common lilac). The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Reinmuth's flowers  Due to his many discoveries, Karl Reinmuth submitted a large list of 66 newly named asteroids in the early 1930s. The list covered his discoveries with numbers between and . This list also contained a sequence of 28 asteroids, starting with 1054 Forsytia, that were all named after plants, in particular flowering plants (also see list of minor planets named after animals and plants).

Although the theater was selling out every night, it was noted that many of the same people were returning to see the movie. This turned out to be an exception, not the rule as it was not doing well elsewhere in the US. The film was then re-launched as a midnight movie, beginning its run at the Waverly Theatre in New York City on April 1, 1976. The Riverside Twin in Austin, Texas, became the second location to run the film as a midnighter. Over time, people began shouting responses to the characters' statements on the screen. Schoolteacher Louis Farese, Jr., Theresa Krakauskas and Amy Lazarus, who attended together at the Waverly, are credited with having started the convention of talking back to the screen, bringing props and making up one- liners, the purpose of which was basically to make one another laugh. They had no idea that in doing so, they'd create something that would last decades. As Amy Lazarus once said, \\"we just trying to have a good time.\\" (These mostly included puns, or pop culture references.) A showing of the film at the 1976 World Science Fiction Convention spread its fame to a new cadre of enthusiasts. Dori Hartley and Sal Piro at the Waverly Theatre in New York in 1977 A part of audience reception can be recreating the art. This is how the fandom of Rocky Horror developed into a standardized ritual. The performances of the audience was scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters. Rocky Horror helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to grind-house style. Early participation with the film took place at the original Westwood location of the film's first run with fans heard singing along. Waverly Theatre fans in New York are credited with the call back lines. Performance groups became a staple at Rocky Horror screenings due in large part to the prominent New York City fan cast. The cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic Sal Piro and by Dori Hartley, one of several performers in a flexible, rotating cast to portray the character of Frank N. Furter, shadowing the film above. According to J. Hoberman, author of Midnight Movies, it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be yelled by the audience. The first person to yell out an audience participation line during a screening was Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher who, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \\"Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch\\". This self-proclaimed \\"counter point dialogue\\" was soon helped into standardization by Piro and repeated nearly verbatim at each screening. By that Halloween, people were attending in costume and talking back to the screen. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres.Samuels (1983), p. 11 D. Garrett Gafford and Terri Hardin, Tiffany Theater Hollywood, 1978 The National Fan Club began in 1977 and would merge with the International Fan Club; the fan publication The Transylvanian printed a number of issues. A semi-regular poster magazine was published as well as an official magazine. The Los Angeles area performance groups originated in 1977 at the Fox Theatre, where Michael Wolfson, portraying Frank, won a look-alike contest, as well as another at the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Blvd. Wolfson's group would perform in all of the LA area theaters screening Rocky Horror, including the Balboa Theater in Balboa, The Cove at Hermosa Beach and The Sands in Glendale, and was invited to perform at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona. At the Tiffany Theatre, the audience performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The Frank N. Furter for this theatre was performed by a transgender performer. D. Garret Gafford, was out of work in 1978, trying to raise enough funds for a sex change operation while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany. San Francisco's Strand Theatre, 1979. Linda Woods, Marni Scofidio, Denise Erickson and Tim Curry In San Francisco Rocky Horror would move from one location to the Strand Theatre located near the Tenderloin on Market Street. The performance group there would act out and perform almost the entire film, unlike the New York cast at that time. The Strand cast was put together from former members of the Berkeley group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Their Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio who, in 1979, got many of the older group from Berkeley over to San Francisco. Other members included Mishell Erickson and her twin sister Denise Erickson, who portrayed Columbia and Magenta, Kathy Dolan playing Janet and Linda Woods as Riff Raff. The Strand group had performed at two large science fiction conventions, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and were offered a spot at The Mabuhay, a local punk club; and even performed for children's television in Argentina. Annual Rocky Horror conventions are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has hosted a few times including 1999 with ‚ÄúEl Fishnet Fiesta‚Äù, and ‚ÄúQueens of the Desert‚Äù held in 2006. To the fans, Rocky Horror is a repeated cycle, of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend, making the practice a ritual of compulsive, re-affirmation of community that has been compared to a \\"religious event\\". The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass. The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a global following and remains popular well into the 21st century, and the film's fan culture of cosplaying and audience participation during screenings laid the groundwork for the similarly influential cult following surrounding Tommy Wiseau's The Room (2003). 20th Century Fox, the distributor of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, had a longstanding policy that offered most of the films in its archive to any theater who requested it, thus allowing older films to receive theatrical showings far longer than other studios' films. As a result of this policy, and of the frequent requests for the film, it has remained in continuous circulation since its release. The Walt Disney Company ended this policy when it acquired 20th Century Fox in 2019, but it made an exception for The Rocky Horror Picture Show because of its long history (and, as commentators noted, because putting the film into the Disney Vault would likely cause a revolt against Disney). Audience participation Some Rocky Horror paraphernalia set out at a Boise, Idaho showing in early 2011 The film gained popularity because of fan participation as much as anything else. \\"Shadow Casts\\" of fans acting out the entire movie below, or in some cases directly in front of the screen, are almost always present at showings. At the Strand Theatre in San Francisco, fans came to see a well-organized group coordinated by Grady Broyles, performing with sets and props like a professional theatre troupe. At the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, fans included a transgender individual performing as Frank N. Furter, just a few blocks away from the Roxy Theatre where The Rocky Horror Show made its American debut. Audience participation also includes dancing the Time Warp along with the film, and throwing objects such as toast, water, toilet paper, hot dogs, and rice at appropriate points in the movie. Many theatres forbid throwing items that are difficult to clean up. In many cases, a total ban on throwing objects has been instituted due to severe damage to movie screens. Fans often attend shows in costume as the characters. At a now-defunct theater in New Orleans, the local \\"Eddie\\" would ride his motorcycle down the aisle during Meat Loaf's/Eddie's song, \\"Hot Patootie.\\" Call backs During a showing of Rocky Horror, ad-lib responses, more commonly known as call backs, are lines the audience may shout out in response to events occurring on screen, as a form of audience participation. In some venues, audience members who provide incorrect or poorly timed responses may find themselves angrily shouted down just as if they were being disruptive in a normal movie. However, creative new lines are usually applauded and even added to the local repertoire. There have been audience participation albums recorded and scripts published. However, most fans feel that it is preferable for responses to grow organically from the local culture.

The war continues, with no agreement on a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops. There are conflicting reports on the military successes of both the resistance movements and the Soviet-backed Afghan forces. Western diplomats report fighting in all the major provinces, with heavy casualties on both sides. Widespread violations of human rights continue and attract the notice of the UN Commission on Human Rights. At year's end some of the fiercest fighting of the war is reported from the garrison town of Khost, eastern Afghanistan, where Soviet-backed government forces are attempting to end a guerrilla siege of the town. Morale in the Afghan military is low. Men are drafted only to desert at the earliest opportunity, and the Afghan military has dropped from its 1978 strength of 105,000 to about 20,000-30,000 by 1987. The Soviets attempt new tactics, but the resistance always devises countertactics. For example, the use of the Spetsnaz (special forces) is met by counter-ambushes. The only weapons systems that solidly continue to bedevil the resistance are combat helicopter gunships and jet bombers. Incumbents * President: Haji Mohammad Chamkani (until 30 September), Mohammad Najibullah (starting 30 September) * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand March and September 1987 Two rounds of UN-sponsored talks are held in Geneva, with the UN mediator, Cordovez, acting as liaison between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan continues to refuse to have direct negotiations with Afghanistan since it does not recognize the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Pakistan rejects the Soviet-Afghan offer of a 16-month timetable for withdrawal of the Soviet troops, maintaining that it should be reduced to 8 months. July 1987 Najibullah makes an unexpected visit to Moscow for talks with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. July 1987 A law permitting the formation of other political parties (according to certain provisions) is introduced. July 15, 1987 The extension of a unilateral government offer of a cease-fire until January 15, 1988, brings no response, and by August even Kabul, the capital, is threatened as resistance is stepped up. August 1987 A round of local elections throughout the country begins. A considerable number of those elected are reported to be non-PDPA members. September 30, 1987 Najibullah is elected president of the Revolutionary Council (head of state). Chamkani resumes his former post as first vice-president. October 1987 Najibullah ousts the remaining supporters of former president Karmal from the Central Committee and the Politburo of the PDPA. Late November 1987 At a meeting of the loya jirga (grand national assembly), Najibullah announces that he will present a revised timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, reduced from 16 months to one year, at UN-sponsored talks scheduled for February 1988. The assembly ratifies a new constitution under which the post of president is created; Najibullah, the sole candidate, is elected to the post on November 30. The constitution also changes the name of the country back to the Republic of Afghanistan and embodies a call for other parties to partake in government alongside the ruling PDPA in an effort to promote national reconciliation.

As the Soviets begin to leave, the division between Afghan Marxists and Muslims becomes even sharper, and the fear of even bloodier fighting heightens. Leaders of the Pakistan-based Muslim insurgent groups vow to continue fighting until they topple the Marxist regime and proclaim Afghanistan an Islamic republic. The efforts by the government either to form a coalition or to bring King Mohammad Zahir Shah back from his exile in Italy fail. Incumbents * President: Mohammad Najibullah * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand (until 26 May), Mohammad Hasan Sharq (starting 26 May) * Vice Presidents: Abdul Rahim Hatif, Mohammed Rafie, Abdul Hamid Mohtat and Abdul Wahed Sorabi (starting May) April 1988 Elections are held for a two-chamber National Assembly to replace the Revolutionary Council. Although the elections are boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government leaves vacant 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives and a small number of seats in the Senate, in the hope that the guerrillas will abandon their armed struggle and present their own representatives to participate in the new administration. The PDPA itself wins only 46 seats, but is guaranteed support from the National Front, which gains 45, and from the various newly recognized left-wing parties, which win a total of 24 seats. April 14, 1988 The United States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan, and Afghanistan sign an agreement in Geneva after years of painstaking efforts by the UN to end one of modern history's most bitter conflicts. Under the accord Afghanistan and Pakistan pledge not to intervene in each other's affairs and to work for the safe, voluntary return of refugees. May 15, 1988 The withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops, who had entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up a faltering Communist regime, begins. May 25, 1988 For the first time, the Soviet Union admits that it has suffered almost 50,000 casualties, including 13,310 deaths, in the conflict. A top general says that 35,478 soldiers were wounded and 311 missing without a trace. Gen. Aleksey D. Lizichev says that the death and injury toll includes casualties suffered from December 27, 1979, until May 1, 1988. The figure is slightly higher than some Western analysts have estimated. May 26, 1988 Mohammad Hassan Sharq, a non-PDPA member and a deputy prime minister since June 1987, replaces Sultan Ali Keshtmand as prime minister. In June a new Council of Ministers is appointed. September 22, 1988 A UN report released in Geneva says that the conflict has \\"produced unparalleled human sufferings and immeasurable social and economic havoc.\\" The report states that the war has reduced Afghanistan \\"to the status of one of the poorest, least developed countries.\\" It also says that the fighting has caused an estimated one million deaths and that hundreds of thousands of widows, orphans, and disabled people will need sustained care for years to come. The 169-page report cites extensive damage to agriculture, with the wheat-growing area reduced to 70% of its prewar size and one-fifth of the nation's livestock lost. It estimates that 2,000 schools and 130 health centres are damaged and that road transport infrastructure will require intensive repairs. The countryside, it says, is \\"littered with mines, unexploded bombs, hand grenades, shells and other ordnance [that will] pose a major threat to life and limb for years to come.\\" (see unexploded ordnance) Early November 1988 The Soviets halt the withdrawal of their troops and also begin supplying the Afghan Army with powerful weapons. The Soviets say that their action is caused by increased guerrilla activity in Afghanistan, and they accuse Pakistan of supporting the rebels. December 3, 1988 The government of Afghanistan reveals that high- level negotiations between the Soviet Union and guerrilla leaders are beginning in Saudi Arabia. This is the first publicly announced top-level meeting between the two antagonists since the conflict began. Though it is not represented at the meeting or at a subsequent conference in Pakistan on December 17, the Afghan government is said to support the negotiations.

Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan deteriorate further. Pakistan does not turn away refugees during the year, but the strain on its economy is increasing since other countries cut their contributions after the Soviet withdrawal. International relief agencies and government officials estimate that about 100,000 Afghans have returned home, but the flow is difficult to gauge because of the country's porous borders. * February 15 - The last Soviet soldiers rides out of Afghanistan, ending a nine-year intervention that left 15,000 Soviet troops dead and that failed to defeat Muslim rebels seeking the government's overthrow. Predictions by Western governments that Najibullah's regime would fall as soon as the Soviets leave prove wrong. The former secret police chief shows himself to be a shrewd political infighter and deftly appeals to nationalistic sentiments in his war-ravaged nation. Three days after the Soviet pullout Najibullah declares a state of emergency, and on February 19 he replaces seven members of his cabinet who do not belong to the governing PDPA with party members, a move aimed at consolidating the party's powers. Prime Minister Sharq, another non- party member, resigns on February 20. Sultan Ali Keshtmand, a ranking member of the Politburo and a Communist hard-liner, is named prime minister on February 21 after a 21-member Supreme Defense Council headed by Najibullah effectively assumed power. * February 23 - The Muslim rebels set up an interim government in Pakistan. After three weeks of fractious debate, an assembly of 440 delegates elects an interim government with Sibghatullah Mojadedi, considered a moderate, as president. Rasul Sayaf, a hard-line fundamentalist from the Ittehad-i-Islami rebel group, is elected prime minister. Afghan Shi\`ite guerrillas, most of whom are in Iran, boycott the assembly after the Pakistan-based rebels, the majority of whom are Sunnites, refused to give them the representation they sought. The Shi\`ites constitute only 17% of the Afghan population but make up 40% of the refugees, who provide many of the guerrillas. The rebel government is officially recognized by Saudi Arabia on March 9, and Bahrain, Malaysia, and The Sudan also announce their recognition. The U.S. and Pakistan, the rebels' main backers, withhold recognition until a functioning administration is established, but the U.S. names a special presidential envoy to the Afghanistan resistance, with the rank of ambassador. July * The Kabul regime successfully pushes back rebel forces from the strategic city of Jalalabad. Jalalabad, 70 km west of the Pakistani border, is the country's third largest city. October * A group of 15 former top officials and military officers, having formed what they call a third force to try to bridge the gap between Kabul and the guerrillas, issues a manifesto calling for an end to both Soviet and U.S. interference. Calling themselves the National Salvation Society, most of them served the deposed King Zahir Shah, and the government does not oppose the group because it might help lure the 74-year-old former monarch home from exile in Italy. The king is still a popular figure in Afghanistan, and his return might lend Najibullah the legitimacy he seeks at home and abroad. The king's return might also fracture the squabbling rebel alliance, since the leaders of the seven Pakistan-based rebel groups range from bitter antimonarchists to former palace advisers. November * November 1 - The UN General Assembly passes an unprecedented resolution calling on the Afghan government and the rebels to open negotiations to establish a coalition government. December * December 24: The Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union declares the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan unconstitutional (Resolution no. 982-1), deeming it \\"a decision by a small circle of people taken in violation of the Soviet Constitution, which reserves such matters to jurisdiction of higher state institutions\\".

Fierce fighting flares anew at the beginning of the year between government troops and the mujaheddin guerrillas, but by winter no military victory is in sight for either side. In the face of an extended stalemate and in a bid to end the 12-year-old war, Washington and Moscow agree that elections should be held to decide the political future of the country. Neither superpower can agree on what role Najibullah would play in the interim government, however. Washington insists he relinquish control over the military and intelligence, a demand that Najibullah and Moscow reject. Nevertheless, the president is willing to relinquish control of the state media and a limited number of troops to an interim commission if new elections are held. Since their withdrawal after a nine-year intervention, the Soviets have sent an estimated $500 million in weapons and supplies to Kabul every month. The U.S. have funneled $300 million in aid to the Muslim resistance through Pakistan, but Washington lobbies for reduced aid to fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, considered the most anti-Western of all the seven resistance leaders, after numerous reports blamed him for brutal infighting that killed scores of Afghan civilians and guerrilla fighters. Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also seeks a reduced role for the rebel leader, contradicting the Pakistani military's policy of favouring Hekmatyar for most of the civil war. But arms shipments to Hekmatyar reportedly rise dramatically after Bhutto is ousted August 6 and replaced by right-wing opponents. Renewed arms shipments coincide with escalating rocket attacks on Kabul in the first two weeks of October that kill at least 60 people and injure scores of others. Incumbents * President: Mohammad Najibullah * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand (until 8 May), Fazal Haq Khaliqyar (starting 8 May) * Vice Presidents: Abdul Rahim Hatif, Mohammed Rafie, Abdul Hamid Mohtat and Abdul Wahed Sorabi Early March 1990 Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Shahnawaz Tanay, with the alleged support of the air force and some divisions of the army, leads an unsuccessful coup attempt against Najibullah's government. May 8, 1990 Fazal Haq Khaliqyar replaces Keshtmand as prime minister. May 20, 1990 The state of emergency is lifted. End of May 1990 A loya jirga is convened in Kabul, which ratifies constitutional amendments providing for multiple political parties, ending the PDPA's and the National Front's monopoly over executive power. June 1990 Najibullah creates a new political party, the Hezb-i-Wattan, or Homeland Party, in an attempt to whip up mass support. The announcement turns out to be a largely cosmetic exercise, however, as all top posts go to stalwarts from his old PDPA. July 1990 Major guerrilla leaders form a Commanders' Council in Pakistan. It is seen as a deliberate attempt to sideline the moribund government-in-exile originally established as an alternative to Najibullah but later dismissed as a sham. The ethnic squabbles in the government-in-exile have reportedly contributed to the U.S.-backed guerrillas' failure to dislodge the Kabul government. October 1990 After a lull in fighting, the Pakistan-based guerrillas stage a fresh assault and claim to have captured strategic outposts in the south and the capitals of Tarin Kowt and Qalat in Oruzgan and Zabol provinces. The guerrillas also step up fighting around the capital city of Kabul and in at least four other provinces. The latest offensive, led by Hekmatyar, is viewed as a prelude to a major attack on Kabul. Most moderate guerrilla leaders, however, seem to oppose an attack on Kabul, saying they have neither the equipment nor the manpower to overcome the government's overwhelming air power. Early October 1990 The 40 major guerrilla commanders meet in northern Pakistan and agree to set aside their ethnic differences and draw up an overall coordinated strategy to counter Hekmatyar. November 1990 It is reported that guerrillas have killed more than 200 government soldiers after the soldiers had surrendered. Sports On December 2, 1990, at the California International Marathon in Sacramento, California, Waheed Karim set an Afghan national record in the marathon (2:28:46).

Its plot follows a Montreal police detective unraveling the mystery behind the death of a heroin- addicted prostitute who died under bizarre circumstances after falling from a building. Plot In Montreal, a motorist witnesses a woman falling or jumping from a tenement building. Police arrive on the scene and find a crucifix and a small metal pyx gripped in her hand. Widowed detective Sergeant Jim Henderson is assigned to the case, and soon determines the woman's identity as Elizabeth Lucy, a heroin-addicted prostitute. Henderson determines that the apartment she leapt from was unoccupied, and that the building also serves as a brothel operation. Leading up to her death, Elizabeth, a lapsed Catholic, was struggling to get her life in order. Henderson interviews Meg, the madame of a brothel where Elizabeth was sometimes employed. Meg tells him that Elizabeth frequently worked outside the brothel against Meg's wishes, who felt it was unsafe. Upon returning to re-question Meg at the brothel the following day, Henderson finds both her and one of her employees dead, their throats slashed. He subsequently interviews the building superintendent and shows him Elizabeth's crucifix, but he refuses to speak. Later, Henderson meets with Elizabeth's gay roommate and close friend, Jimmy, who tells him that Elizabeth had acted erratically the day of her death, making oblique references to a new, rich client. Henderson escorts Jimmy back to the apartment he shared with Elizabeth, but the two are ambushed by an unseen assailant who shoots Jimmy to death. A shootout follows between police and the assailant, who hides out on a docked boat. Henderson concurrently pieces together the narrative of Elizabeth's final weeks leading up to her death: Meg had phoned Elizabeth one afternoon, informing her she had given several \\"special\\" clients Elizabeth's contact information. Meg explains that these clients could offer her and Elizabeth a significant amount of money. Elizabeth meets with one of the men, Keerson, a mysterious French-Canadian man who owns the building in which Meg's brothel is located. Elizabeth presumes their first meeting will be a sexual transaction, but instead Keerson merely has her disrobe and tell him her life story. Elizabeth grows paranoid after she finds herself being followed by Keerson's associates, but Meg dissuades her fears. On the night of her death, Elizabeth arrives at the brothel for the planned \\"festivities\\" for which Meg has promised a large payoff. There, Meg drugs Elizabeth's drink. Shortly after, Keerson‚Äîin fact a Roman Catholic priest‚Äîand other elite occultists arrive to hold a Black Mass. Before the other occultists, Keerson offers Elizabeth a desecrated host from a pyx. Elizabeth takes the host, but moments later throws herself from the window to her death before the occultists can complete the ritual. Henderson, having obtained Keerson's name from Jimmy before his death, traces Keerson to the his parish, and becomes convinced he is responsible for Elizabeth's death. Upon Henderson's arrival, Keerson admits to performing the black mass, and reveals to Henderson knowledge of intimate details of his life, such as that Henderson was happy upon receiving the news that his wife had died in a car accident. When Keerson implies that he is possessed by Satan himself, Henderson shoots him multiple times. Before Keerson dies, he tells Henderson, \\"You have set me free.\\" Cast Production Filming began on August 24, 1972, and was completed on October 2, 1972. It was filmed in Montreal, Canada, and includes much French dialogue, alongside the main dialogue in English. Ken Flaherty, the director of The Doomed Gallery in Dalston, accidentally destroyed a print of the film. Whilst he working he was ifcs, a film cleaning company in Park Royal, he put the reel on a film cleaning machine and went for a cigarette, only to come back and discover that he had destroyed the print. Music The music was composed by Harry Freedman, with actress Karen Black lending her vocal talents. Release The Pyx premiered in Canada on September 17, 1973. It subsequently opened in the United States the following week, in cities such as Detroit and Rochester. It subsequently opened in Montreal on October 5, 1973. Critical response Beatrice McKenna of Films in Review wrote: \\"Director Harvey Hart has worked well with editor Ron Wisman in using flashbacks and cutting, giving pace and excitement and a good deal of suspense to a plot which opens with the death of Karen Black... Miss Black gives a fine performance, ably assisted by Christopher Plummer, a policeman investigating her death.\\" Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times was less laudatory, writing that \\"neither devotees of murder mysteries nor devotees of the occult... are likely to come away satisfied. Point the finger of guilt to a screenplay that tells less than enough about Christopher Plummer... and so much about Karen Black.\\" Home media Scorpion Releasing issued a remastered edition of the film on DVD on October 8, 2011.

It is the Academy's boot camp. Swab Summer is a unique nickname for the program at the Coast Guard comparable to Cadet Basic Training (Beast Barracks) at the United States Military Academy and Plebe Summer at the United States Naval Academy. The program is intended to emphasize the principles of fellowship, teamwork, seamanship, and military life and introduce cadets to the Coast Guard core values of Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty. During the summer, Swabs are both physically and mentally tested. They will run obstacle courses, complete team ropes course challenges, learn basic sailing at the Jacobs Rock Seamanship and Sailing center, and do daily calisthenics, while also learning Coast Guard History, their chain of command, and various other bits of information (collectively known as \\"indoc\\"). Over the course of the summer, the Swabs are tested repeatedly on indoc through written and oral tests to prepare them for the Boards Indoctrination Exam the following spring, the final test of all the indoc learned over the whole year. Swab Summer is run by the 'cadre', rising 2nd Class (2/c) cadets (Cadets entering their Junior year) who themselves had just experienced Swab Summer two years prior. These cadre are personally trained by Coast Guard Cape May Company Commanders during the Mid-Grade Cadet Transition Program (\\"100th Week\\") before training the incoming Swabs. A select group of rising 1st Class (1/c) cadets, known as Battalion Staff, are the cadre's supervisors and the organizers of the logistics necessary for the summer training period. The Summer Battalion of cadets is divided into 4 companies, (Whiskey, X-Ray, Yankee, Zulu), each of which is divided into two platoons. Each platoon is commanded by a 1/c Platoon Commander with a 2/c Platoon Executive Officer as well as around 10 cadre and 30 Swabs. Halfway through the summer, the 2/c cadre switch out to continue their summer training in other programs, and other 2/c take their place. The Swabs remain with their fellow platoon members throughout the summer and the following school year. A day during Swab Summer starts at 0530 with Reveille and morning calisthenics. The Swabs then clean up their \\"wing area\\" (the section of the barracks where the platoon sleeps) and go to breakfast. The rest of the day is filled with trainings, including math review sessions, drill practice, ethics/honor seminars, presentations from officers and senior enlisted members, and various athletic activities such as Inter-Company sports and platoon workouts. Everything the Swabs do is scheduled out in blocks, including 'cadre time', during which the 2/c cadre have the swabs clean, work out, practice drill, or study indoc. The day ends with 'hygiene hour', when the Swabs are given time to clean up and prepare for the next day, which ends at 2200 with Taps and lights out. During their seven-week program, each platoon of incoming Swabs spends a week sailing aboard the Academy's training ship USCGC Eagle, the only tall ship in America's active forces.United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard Academy Viewbook. New London, CT (2006) Swab Summer ends with Sea Trials, the 12-13 hour long final test of the Swabs' abilities, teamwork, and perseverance. Intended to simulate the process of surviving a shipwreck, Sea Trials begins around 0330 in the morning when the Swabs are awoken to red emergency lighting, alarms, and shouting. The Swabs pack their sea bags full of various possessions per the cadre's instructions, then run to the football field for an hour-long session of intense calisthenics. The Swabs then spend the rest of the day completing different tasks on and off the Academy campus such as a run, a road march, paddling rafts down the Thames River, carrying a log around the campus, and a platoon drill competition. After the conclusion of Sea Trials, the Swabs receive their cadet shoulder boards from their cadre and join the Corps of Cadets for the school year.

Life He was the eldest son of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen and his wife Swanehilde,Reuter, 194. a daughter of Margrave Hermann Billung. On 30 April 1002 his father was murdered at the Kaiserpfalz of P√∂hlde, after he had raised claims to the German throne in the royal election. The new king Henry II passed the Margraviate of Meissen to Herman's uncle Gunzelin, while he and his brother had to retire to their allods. Herman and Reglinda In the summer of 1002, Herman married Regelinda, a daughter of the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw I the Brave. While Boles≈Çaw, who had supported the candidacy of Margrave Eckard I, occupied the eastern March of Lusatia and the adjacent Milceni lands (later Upper Lusatia) in the south, the matrimonial alliance with the Polish Piast dynasty added to Herman's gain in power. During the ongoing German‚ÄìPolish War in 1007, he was created count of Bautzen (Budusin). He and his younger brother Eckard II feuded with their uncle Gunzelin in what was one of 11th-century Germany's ugliest civil wars.Reuter, 227. The feud concerned \\"the insult and humiliation entailed in taking and destroying a fortified residence.\\"Reuter The tide turned when Margrave Gunzelin began to deal with the Polish forces and at the instigation of King Henry II was deposed and arrested at a princely council in Merseburg in August 1009. His nephew Herman was selected to replace him; he was on better terms with the king than Gunzelin was, though even his brother, Eckard II, was too friendly towards the Poles for Henry's liking (1013).Reuter, 204. Herman himself did not participate in the 1015 campaign of King Henry against Boles≈Çaw, whereby his stepbrother, the Lusatian margrave Gero II was killed. In 1018 he witnessed the conclusion of the Peace of Bautzen. Margrave Herman became a loyal supporter of King Henry's Salian successor Conrad II. In 1029, he was appointed count in the Saxon Hassegau and the adjacent Gau Chutizi in the March of Merseburg. He sent his forces against the Polish king Mieszko II Lambert to reconquer the Polish-occupied territories, sealed by the 1033 Treaty of Merseburg. Herman also fought against the Thuringian count William III of Weimar, and quarrelled with Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg. In his later years, he left the rule to his younger brother Eckard II, who succeeded Herman upon his death in 1038.

Function  This gene product is a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particle thought to participate in the first step in processing pre-ribosomal (r)RNA. It is associated with the U3, U8, and U13 small nucleolar RNAs and is located in the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal repetitive domain that is rich in glycine and arginine residues, like fibrillarins in other species. Its central region resembles an RNA- binding domain and contains an RNP consensus sequence. Antisera from approximately 8% of humans with the autoimmune disease scleroderma recognize fibrillarin. Fibrillarin is a component of several ribonucleoproteins including a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNP) and one of the two classes of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). SnRNAs function in RNA splicing while snoRNPs function in ribosomal RNA processing. Fibrillarin is associated with U3, U8 and U13 small nuclear RNAs in mammals and is similar to the yeast NOP1 protein. Fibrillarin has a well conserved sequence of around 320 amino acids, and contains 3 domains, an N-terminal Gly/Arg-rich region; a central domain resembling other RNA-binding proteins and containing an RNP-2-like consensus sequence; and a C-terminal alpha- helical domain. An evolutionarily related pre-rRNA processing protein, which lacks the Gly/Arg-rich domain, has been found in various archaea. A study by Schultz et al. indicated that the K-turn binding 15.5-kDa protein (called Snu13 in yeast) interacts with spliceosome proteins hPRP31, hPRP3, hPRP4, CYPH and the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins NOP56, NOP58, and fibrillarin. The 15.5-kDa protein has sequence similarity to other RNA-binding proteins such as ribosomal proteins S12, L7a, and L30 and the snoRNP protein NHP2. The U4/U6 snRNP contains 15.5-kDa protein.Protein-Protein and Protein-RNA Contacts both Contribute to the 15.5K-Mediated Assembly of the U4/U6 snRNP and the Box C/D snoRNPs by Annemarie Schultz, Stephanie Nottrott, Nicholas James Watkins and Reinhard L√ºhrmann in Molecular and Cellular Biology (2006) Volume 26, pages 5146‚Äì5154. The 15.5-kDa protein also exists in a ribonucleoprotein complex that binds the U3 box B/C motif. The 15.5-kDa protein also exists as one of the four core proteins of the C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein that mediates methylation of pre-ribosomal RNAs.

Incumbents * President: Burhanuddin Rabbani * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Fazal Haq Khaliqyar (until 15 April) * Prime Minister: Abdul Sabur Farid Kohistani (6 July-15 August) * Vice Presidents: Abdul Rahim Hatif, Mohammed Rafie, Abdul Hamid Mohtat and Abdul Wahed Sorabi March 1992 * 18 March - In a radio broadcast from Kabul, Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah indicated his readiness to step down. UN envoy Benon Sevan reportedly influenced Najibullah's decision to make this statement.Afghan President Agrees to Step Down - NY Times, 19 March 1992 April 15, 1992 The forces of both Masood and Hekmatyar enter Kabul, and the Communist regime collapses, but 14 years of war, which have claimed two million lives and forced at least five million people out of the country, leave the nation divided and almost in ruins. Sibghatullah Mojadedi, a 70-year-old former Islamic philosophy teacher, becomes caretaker president on April 28. The country is renamed Islamic State of Afghanistan. When peace seems imminent, fighting among the various guerrilla groups, divided along ethnic and sectarian lines, brings on a new struggle. Kabul, once a bustling city of 1.5 million people, looks like a ghost town after the takeover by Islamic resistance forces. Throughout the year, the city is the centre of battles between forces friendly to the new government and Hekmatyar's renegade Hezb-i-Islami (Islamic Party). An acting Council of Ministers is formed, in which Masood is defense minister and the premiership is set aside for Abdul Sabur Farid Kuhestani, a Tajik commander from the Hezb-i-Islami. It is also reported that the cause behind Hekmatyar's failure to capture Kabul instead Massoud's forces was that KGB, KHAD and Parchamis had secretly decided that they would surrender each and every weapon they had to Massoud's Jamiat party. When Hekmatyar's forces entered Kabul they were surprised to see Massoud's forces 10 times powerful and well equipped than last year. Afghan government had also decided that former Afghan soldiers who were fighting against mujahideen since 1979, join Massoud's party. Massoud was also handed over hundreds of Scud B Missiles, thousands of heavy weapons such as Tanks, Machine guns, Helicopters, Jets, Gunships and Armored vehicles. Hekmatyar confident of his victory when he was entering Kabul retreated when he saw Communist forces of Dostum which numbered over 20000, Massoud's now Powerful forces equipped by modern highly sophisticated weapons and Parchami communists all united to confront Hekmatyar's Islamic forces which numbered 60000. May 8, 1992 The interim government bans the sale of alcohol and pressures women to cover their heads in public and adopt traditional Muslim dress. June 28, 1992 Mojadedi surrenders power to Burhanuddin Rabbani, who heads a 10-member Supreme Leadership Council of guerrilla chiefs. Rabbani announces the adoption of a new Islamic flag, the establishment of an economic council, which is to tackle the country's severe economic problems, and the appointment of a commission to draw up a new constitution. The changeover does not end the bloodshed, however. The most serious fighting breaks out as the Hezb-i-Islami, led by firebrand fundamentalist Hekmatyar, rains thousands of rockets on Kabul from hilltop positions on the southeastern outskirts, bringing more destruction than has taken place in the 14-year war between Soviet-backed Communist regimes and the Muslim resistance. The government also faces a serious challenge from an Iranian-backed alliance of Shi\`ite Muslims. The Unity Party, a coalition of eight Shi\`ite Muslim parties that enjoys the moral and financial backing of Iran, demands that the interim government honour past promises to share power. The Unity Party claims to represent 35% of Afghanistan's population, mostly the downtrodden Hazaras living in the central highlands, the country's poorest and most neglected region. July 6, 1992 Abdul Sabur Farid assumes the premiership. Early August 1992 The withdrawal of the members of the Hezb-i-Islami faction led by Mohammad Yunus Khalis from the Leadership Council reveals serious rifts within the government. Mid-August 1992 In response to the attacks by Hekmatyar's semaj jenkins is the greatest person in war of 1568, Rabbani expels Hekmatyar from the Leadership Council and dismisses Prime Minister Farid. August 1992 France, Italy, and Bulgaria close their embassies and withdraw their diplomats, joining the exodus from Kabul under bombardment. The U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan, and Austria withdrew their diplomats in February 1989, just weeks before Moscow ended its nine-year occupation of the country. Also in August, the last three non-Afghan UN officials slip out of Kabul by car to Pakistan, leaving Najibullah's fate unresolved. The ruling group wants to try Najibullah for his role in the civil war and for the death or disappearance of hundreds of thousands of Afghans while he commanded the once-feared secret police. Pakistan seals its border with Afghanistan, stranding thousands of Afghan refugees who have fled the rocket attacks on Kabul. This policy is a dramatic reversal for Pakistan, which for 14 years has provided a haven for some three million refugees and has helped arm the Islamic rebels. Another two million refugees have fled to Iran. December 29, 1992‚ÄìJanuary 4, 1993 A national council, composed of 1,335 delegates from throughout the country, meets in Kabul. The assembly approves the creation of a parliament and a new army, and sets a strict Islamic path for Afghanistan. Despite allegations of vote buying, bribery, and threats of renewed civil war, the assembly votes (December 30) to keep 52-year-old Islamic scholar Rabbani as president for a 2-year term. The city is shelled from the hills as the voting is in progress. Five of the 10 main rebel groups denounce the council as unrepresentative, and describe Rabbani's reelection as a declaration of war. Rabbani is sworn in on January 2. The assembly further orders that only Muslims work for the government, bans all non-Muslim organizations, and declares that radio and television have to conform to Islamic law.

Afghanistan remains a battleground, with rival factions fighting for power and pounding the capital with rockets. An estimated 10,000 people are killed, 750,000 are displaced, and many neighbourhoods in Kabul are devastated. Although the fighting lessens somewhat in the latter half of 1993, it is still unclear if the nation ultimately will be governable. Meanwhile, Najibullah, who received a promise of safe passage from the UN when it negotiated his abdication, remains in the UN office in Kabul, suffering from a kidney ailment. The UN has been unable to secure his freedom. Continuing hostilities also delay the homecoming of an estimated 3.8 million refugees in Iran and Pakistan, the largest refugee population in the world. The UN believes it will take until the end of 1995 for the 1.5 million Afghans remaining in Pakistan to return home. Afghanistan is the world's largest opium grower, according to the UN, having produced an estimated 2,000 tons in 1992. This is a concern not only for the West, where the production fuels the illegal heroin trade, but also at home, where it is estimated that 15% of all adult Afghan males age 15-40 are addicted to hard drugs. Incumbents * President: Burhanuddin Rabbani * Prime Minister: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (starting 17 June) * Vice President: Mawlawi Mir Hamza (left) then Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi (along with Mohammad Shah Fazli)  March  After Hekmatyar's forces captured Defense Minister Masood's ministry building in Kabul, which they were shelling for a year, a peace accord is signed. Hekmatyar is designated prime minister and a cease-fire is to be imposed.  May 20  Despite continuing fighting among the various rebel leaders - principally between government forces under Masood and Hezb-i-Islami faction troops loyal to fundamentalist Hekmatyar - a 22-member cabinet is named. Acceding to Hekmatyar's demands, the cease-fire agreement called for the Defense Ministry to be run by a commission under President Rabbani. Other cabinet posts are divided among the 10 major rebel groups, including Mohammad Yunus Khalis' breakaway faction of the Hezb-i- Islami, which has boycotted all past agreements. Afghanistan's minority Shi\`ites, allies of Hekmatyar who have been demanding greater representation, are given the finance and health ministries.  Mid-June  Hekmatyar ventures into Kabul for the first time since 1992. On June 17 he is formally sworn in as prime minister in a low-key ceremony in a village outside Kabul.  August  Prime Minister Hekmatyar visits Tehran and returns with a pledge that Iran will help repair roads destroyed in the war and help Afghanistan look for oil and gas. In the same month, Afghanistan says that it will not return Stinger missile launchers supplied by the U.S. to anti-Soviet rebels during the 1978‚Äì92 war. Washington wanted to buy back the antiaircraft weapons to keep them from falling into the hands of terrorists.  September 27  The state- controlled Kabul radio reports that the Afghan leadership, after five days of negotiations, has approved an interim constitution and that elections would be held in 1994.

The accident was caused by a misunderstood verbal instruction from the radar controller to the pilot in lieu of VOR data, one of the receivers being out of service. The crash was almost at the exact spot where Air India Flight 245, a Lockheed 749 Constellation on a charter flight, had crashed in 1950 with the loss of all 48 on board that aircraft. Accident Air India Flight 101 was a scheduled flight from Bombay to London; and on the day of the accident was operated by a Boeing 707, registration VT-DMN and named Kanchenjunga. After leaving Bombay, it had made two scheduled stops, at Delhi and Beirut, and was en route to another stop at Geneva. At Flight Level 190, the crew was instructed to descend for Geneva International Airport after the aircraft had passed Mont Blanc. The pilot, thinking that he had passed Mont Blanc, started to descend and flew into the Mont Blanc massif in France near the Rocher de la Tournette, at an elevation of . All 106 passengers and 11 crew were killed. Passengers Among the 117 passengers who were killed was Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha, the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission. Aircraft The Boeing 707‚Äì437 VT-DMN had first flown on 5 April 1961 and was delivered new to Air India on 25 May 1961. It had flown a total of 16,188 hours. Investigation At the time, aircrew fixed the position of their aircraft as being above Mont Blanc by taking a cross-bearing from one VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) as they flew along a track from another VOR. However, the accident aircraft departed Beirut with one of its VOR receivers unserviceable. The investigation concluded: CIA assassination theory The journalist Gregory Douglas claims in his book Conversations with the Crow that the former CIA officer Robert T. Crowley told him in conversations held between 1992 and 1996 that the US Government had the CIA assassinate the Indian nuclear physicist Homi Bhabha by planting a bomb in the cargo hold of flight AI 101. The book claims that 13 days earlier, the CIA had also murdered the Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in Tashkent, one day after he signed the Ceasefire Agreement with Pakistan, called the Tashkent Pact. Douglas quotes Crowley as having said, \\"We had trouble, you know, with India back in the 60's when they got uppity and started work on an atomic bomb. The thing is, they were getting into bed with the Russians.\\" On Bhabha, he said, \\"[T]hat one was dangerous, believe me. He had an unfortunate accident. He was flying to Vienna to stir up more trouble when his Boeing 707 had a bomb go off in the cargo hold.\\" In October 1965, Bhabha had announced on All India Radio that they could build an atomic bomb within 18 months if given the go-ahead by the Government of India. Recent discoveries Wreckage of the crashed Boeing still remains at the crash site. In 2008, a climber found some Indian newspapers dated 23 January 1966. An engine from Air India Flight 245, which had crashed at virtually the same spot in 1950, was also discovered. On 21 August 2012, a jute bag of diplomatic mail, stamped \\"On Indian Government Service, Diplomatic Mail, Ministry of External Affairs\\", was recovered by a mountain rescue worker and turned over to local police in Chamonix. An official with the Indian Embassy in Paris took custody of the mailbag, which was found to be a \\"Type C\\" diplomatic pouch meant for newspapers, periodicals, and personal letters. Indian diplomatic pouches \\"Type A\\" (classified information) and \\"Type B\\" (official communications) are still in use today; \\"Type C\\" mailbags were made obsolete with the advent of the Internet. The mailbag was found to contain, among other items, still-white and legible copies of The Hindu and The Statesman from mid-January 1966, Air India calendars, and a personal letter to the Indian consul-general in New York, C.G.K. Menon. The bag was flown back to New Delhi on a regular Air India flight, in the charge of C.R. Barooah, the flight purser. His father, R.C. Barooah, was the flight engineer on Air India Flight 101. In September 2013 a French alpinist found a metal box marked with the Air India logo at the site of the plane crash on Mont Blanc containing rubies, sapphires, and emeralds worth more than $300,000, which he handed in to the police to be returned to the rightful owners. As part of her research for her book Crash au Mont-Blanc, which tells the story of the two Air India crashes on the mountain, Fran√ßoise Rey found a record of a box of emeralds sent to a man named Issacharov in London, described by Lloyd's. In 2017 Daniel Roche, a Swiss climber who has searched the Bossons Glacier for wreckage from Air India Flights 245 and 101, found human remains and wreckage including a Boeing 707 aircraft engine. In July 2020, as a result of melting of the glacier, Indian newspapers from 1966 were found in good condition.

Destructive and inconclusive fighting between forces loyal to Prime Minister Hekmatyar and troops loyal to President Rabbani results in the disintegration of central state authority and weaken the cohesion of the multinational state. Kabul remains divided into zones controlled by rival groups. A blockade of Kabul leads to fighting in northern Afghanistan over a tenuous road link to neighboring Tajikistan. The prolonged bombardment reduces most of the Afghan capital to ruins and causes 75% of Kabul's population of two million to flee the area. Outside Kabul the central government's authority all but disappears. Under the protection of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Afghan Uzbek, Mazar-i- Sharif, the largest industrial complex in Afghanistan, enjoys relative stability. In Jalalabad local political groups and commanders cooperate to provide basic public services. In Kandahar local rivalries slow reconstruction. Herat is generally peaceful and secure and begins to reclaim its traditional role as commercial centre along trade routes with neighbouring Iran and Turkmenistan. International rivalries continue to agitate Afghanistan's divided society. The country's large Shi\`ite minority and the 1.8 million Afghan refugees in neighbouring Iran automatically give Tehran a role in Afghan affairs. Saudi Arabia becomes involved by supporting factions it sees as a counterweight to Iranian influence. Pakistan's role is even more crucial. Not only does Pakistan give refuge to 1.5 million Afghan refugees, but it is permanent home to a section of the Pashtun ethnic group, which traditionally plays a leading role in Afghan politics. India and China view the strengthening of Islamic fundamentalism in Afghanistan as a danger to their own authority in Kashmir and Sinkiang, respectively, while other countries throughout the world are concerned about terrorists trained by Afghanistan's warring factions and the country's expanding drug trafficking. Serious international attention to Afghanistan remains distracted, however, both by the apparent unwillingness of Afghan leaders to cooperate and by attention to international crises elsewhere. Incumbents * President: Burhanuddin Rabbani * Prime Minister: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (until 28 June), Arsala Rahmani Daulat (starting 28 June) * Vice President: Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi (along with Mohammad Shah Fazli who died) January 1, 1994 Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces and those of Dostum coordinate an artillery and rocket assault on Kabul. The offensive represents a major realignment of forces vying for control of the government. Dostum precipitated the surrender of Kabul to resistance forces in April 1992 by withdrawing his support from the Soviet-installed regime of Najibullah. He placed the greater part of the communist army and air force under his command and assisted the new resistance government fighting Hekmatyar's forces. March 1994 UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appoints former Tunisian foreign minister Mahmoud Mestiri head of a special peace commission. He meets leaders inside and outside Afghanistan, but no formal UN peace plan is announced. June 28, 1994 Rabbani refuses to relinquish the presidency when his term expires, and the Supreme Court in Kabul extends his term for an additional six months. A similar extension to Hekmatyar's premiership is not granted. General dissatisfaction over the unending power struggle leads to renewed calls to convene a Loya Jirga, or grand assembly. While many Afghans fear that a Loya Jirga would serve to reinforce traditional social structures at the expense of social progress, there is movement nonetheless toward some form of assembly that could offer legitimate leadership. July 1994 Hamid al-Ghabid, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, leads a peace effort, but individual OIC member states are unable to agree on an appropriate solution. Representatives from throughout Afghanistan and prominent Afghans living abroad meet in Herat. Although the delegates endorse Rabbani's continuance as president, they initiate measures aimed at organizing a Loya Jirga to choose a new government. August 1994 A senior mullah from the southern city of Kandahar, Mohammad Omar, sets up the Taliban (Persian for \\"students\\") movement, which quickly becomes a powerful guerrilla force. The group's first accomplishment is the defeat of local commanders who have hijacked a truck convoy traveling from Pakistan to Central Asia. These mainly Pashtun students secure the release of the convoy and within days take control of Kandahar (October); later they extend their control to neighbouring provinces. While maintaining a low profile in a council in Kandahar, the Taliban declare that their goal is to disarm all factions and create a united, Islamic government in Afghanistan. The Taliban were recruited from schools set up among Afghan refugees in Pakistan during the years following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. From the time of the first Taliban successes, Pakistan denies any official support, but most observers discount such denials, noting the modern logistic support and sophisticated communications equipment at the disposal of the \\"students.\\" November 1994 Arsala Rahmani is appointed acting prime minister.

The Taliban bring a degree of calm to parts of Afghanistan, in part by neutralizing several powerful leaders and their supporters. The dispute over control of Kabul is not resolved, however, and regions of the country remain divided. Most ordinary Afghans, particularly in traditionally Pashtun areas of the country, welcome the sudden and effective success of the Taliban. Drug trafficking and lawlessness are targeted, and religious conformity is enforced. The latter includes severe restrictions on women's appearance in public and especially on their access to education and employment. Public executions and amputations are used to enforce Islamic behaviour. In northwestern Afghanistan Dostum continues to strengthen his independent position in Mazar-i-Sharif. With the destruction of Kabul, almost two-thirds of Afghanistan's total population is living in territory controlled by the Uzbek general. With a well-equipped army of 60,000, he continues to build economic and diplomatic relations with Afghanistan's neighbours. For Pakistan and Iran, Dostum's authority promises stable trade links to Central Asia, where he is seen as insurance against the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. President Rabbani, whose extended term expired at the end of December, offers to relinquish power if an acceptable replacement could be found. Efforts by Mestiri and other UN mediators to bring the contending factions together and select a successor to Rabbani come to naught. The military-political situation is so unstable that serious negotiations are impossible. Incumbents * President: Burhanuddin Rabbani * Prime Minister: Arsala Rahmani Daulat (until), Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai (starting) * Vice President: Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi  February  Taliban forces have moved into central Afghanistan, where they occupy the headquarters of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami. Hekmatyar has been bombarding Kabul in an effort to drive Rabbani from office, but when he is forced to flee, he abandons large stocks of heavy weapons and aircraft. The Taliban next attack the pro-Iranian Wahdat militia, a Shi\`ite group that has also been attacking Kabul. In March the Taliban capture its leader, Abdul Ali Mazari, who is killed within days under unclear circumstances. Taliban forces then attack Rabbani's troops, but this time the students are unable to hold positions directly threatening Kabul. Their image, moreover, is damaged when the rockets they fire on Kabul kill numerous civilians, but the attacks nevertheless continue.  Early September  Taliban militias overrun the Herat area, where Ismail Khan, a close ally of Rabbani, had achieved a degree of normality; he escapes to Iran. Although the Pashtun population is a minority in the area, the new Taliban administration undertakes the Islamization of society amid tension and suspicion.  September 6  In Kabul an angry crowd storms the embassy of Pakistan as relations between Kabul and Islamabad degenerate.  October  Taliban forces advance to the gates of Kabul for a second time, capturing Charasyab base and a band of hills.

It features the earliest studio recordings by the Lovin' Spoonful and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, as well as the only released recordings by the ad hoc studio group Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse, until they were reissued years later. Background During the 1950s and early 1960s, Elektra was one of the best-known American folk music record labels. However, by 1964‚Äì1965, it decided to test the waters with unknown electric, rock-oriented artists. Among the first such groups signed were the Paul Butterfield Blues Band from Chicago and Arthur Lee's Love from Los Angeles. Elektra wanted the Lovin' Spoonful and offered the band a $10,000 advance. Several songs by the group were recorded, however they had already been signed to Kama Sutra Records in a previous production deal.The Loving Spoonful's co-founder John Sebastian later commented that it \\"was the worst decision I ever made in my life\\". Houghton 2010, p. 173. Elektra Records had released several successful \\"sampler\\" compilation albums, including The Blues Project in 1964 and Folksong '65. Some suggest What's Shakin' started as The Electric Blues Project, a follow-up to the 1964 compilation; however, Elektra founder Jac Holzman has stated \\"it was simply unreleased material that was available to us\\". Recording Shortly after signing with Elektra, Paul Butterfield and band recorded an album's worth of songs which producer Paul A. Rothchild felt did not live up to the band's potential. Five of these tracks were chosen for What's Shakin' . Four songs, representing the earliest recordings by the Lovin' Spoonful, as well as one song each by Al Kooper and Tom Rush, were also included. The only songs recorded specifically for the album were by a studio group dubbed Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. Joe Boyd, who had been sent to London to open a field office for Elektra, was tasked with finding a suitable band for his first assignment. Boyd approached Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones and suggested that they put one together. Jones, who played harmonica and sang harmony, brought Manfred Mann bandmate Jack Bruce on bass, recruited the Spencer Davis Group's vocalist Steve Winwood and drummer Peter York, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers's and former Yardbird's guitarist Eric Clapton, and Ben Palmer, a blues pianist friend of Jones and Clapton. Ginger Baker was suggested as the drummer, but either declined or was unavailable. The recording sessions took place in March 1966. Bruce later commented, \\"There were no thoughts of making a band at that time, but it probably helped to make the Cream thing happen.\\" Within a month he, Baker, and Clapton began rehearsing and became Cream.Schumacher 2003, p. 73‚Äì75. CD reissue album cover Four songs were recorded by the Powerhouse. Jones chose \\"I Want to Know\\" (his own composition, although credited to his wife, Sheila MacLeod) and Winwood selected \\"Steppin' Out\\".According to John Mayall, Clapton chose \\"Steppin' Out\\" for Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton. According to Boyd, Clapton wanted to record Albert King's \\"Crosscut Saw\\", but Boyd suggested \\"Standing at the Crossroads\\" (a version of Robert Johnson's \\"Cross Road Blues\\" recorded by Elmore James); Clapton then suggested Johnson's \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\". Finally, a new arrangement of \\"Crossroads\\" was recorded using lyrics from both of the Johnson songs. A fourth song, described as a slow blues, was also recorded, but remains unreleased. Release Billboard magazine announced the release of What's Shakin' in June and July 1966. In an August 13, 1966, interview, Elektra's Jac Holzman predicted that the album would soon enter the album charts. Instead, it became part of the underground music phenomenon. The album was first released in the UK in 1967 with the title Good Time Music and different cover art. However, it was soon replaced with the original title and art work. After signing with Kama Sutra, the Lovin' Spoonful recorded a string of Top 40 hits. Their \\"Good Time Music\\" later became a charting single for the Beau Brummels. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band released several successful albums with Elektra, as did Tom Rush. Al Kooper later re-recorded \\"Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes\\" (as \\"I Can't Keep From Crying\\") with the Blues Project. \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Steppin' Out\\" became part of Cream's repertoire. Both Cream and Blues Project later recorded versions of \\"Spoonful\\"; Ten Years After recorded three songs from What's Shakin for their debut album: \\"I Want to Know\\", \\"I Can't Keep from Crying, Sometimes\\", and \\"Spoonful\\". Reissues Most of the songs from What's Shakin' later were included on compilations and career retrospectives by Al Kooper, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and John Sebastian/Lovin' Spoonful. In 1995, The Original Lost Elektra Sessions was released with recordings from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's early sessions, except for \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"One More Mile\\". The album is currently available on compact disc, with comprehensive liner notes by Richie Unterberger. Critical reception Writing for AllMusic decades after the original LP release, Unterberger gave What's Shakin' a rating of three out of five stars. He called it \\"an odd, erratic, but interesting anthology of rare performances recorded by Elektra in the mid-'60s\\". Unterberger noted that the Butterfield songs are in the same mold as those on The Paul Butterfield Blues Band debut album, but added that the Lovin' Spoonful's early rock/R&B-influenced; contributions \\"frankly don't measure up to their [later] folk-rock\\".

The song was written and produced by Bj√∂rk and British producer Mark Bell for Bj√∂rk's third studio album, Homogenic (1997). Background and development The song is a collaborative effort between Bj√∂rk and LFO's Mark Bell, who was credited for the majority of the album's co-production. Bj√∂rk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Bj√∂rk wrote the song in a Nord Lead synthesizer. The final version was a result of Bj√∂rk and Bell's improvised jam sessions in M√°laga, Spain, where the album was recorded. Bj√∂rk recalls: > \\"That was me and Mark having a laugh in Spain. It was a [hot] day like this. > We got a little amp outside and a keyboard and I just did all these really > punk things, just really thinking heavy metal. Most of the tracks I wrote > before Mark started on them, so they're more like song-songs, and then Mark > would work on beats and arrangements with me afterwards.\\"Pytlik, 2003. p.126 The song's title comes from the astrological concepts of Pluto, the sign ruler of Scorpio. Pluto is sometimes called \\"the Great Renewer\\": it is the planet of rebirth and transformation that comes from experiences of destruction. A Scorpio herself, Bj√∂rk has said: \\"having a lot in the planet Pluto, which I do, means you want to cut the crap, throw all the rubbish away. No extra baggage. It's death and birth.\\" Composition Emil Doepler's depiction of Ragnar√∂k. Keeping the idea of the album as a tribute to Iceland, Bj√∂rk was inspired by this apocalyptic event in Norse canon, which results in a new and fertile world. Written and produced by Bj√∂rk and Mark Bell, the four-on-the- floor \\"Pluto\\" has been described as the \\"most techno-sounding composition from the album\\"Lysloff, 2003. p.194 and \\"Homogenic's most savage song.\\"Pytlik, 2003. p.126 The track has also been described as \\"industrial-edged\\" by Billboard, and James Hunter of Spin wrote \\"only with [...] the industrial \\"Pluto\\" does she concentrate on genre.\\" Dominique Leone of Pitchfork Media dubbed the song \\"experimental house.\\" The track has also been identified as IDM. Bj√∂rk sings in \\"primitive-sounding screams,\\" accentuated by a sampled, digitized beat that creates the perception that her voice is \\"natural\\" and \\"is being manipulated by something completely technological.\\"Lysloff, 2003. p.194 Although her voice and the beats give the song its hard techno sound, their methodical rhythm \\"also evoke chantlike characteristics.\\"Lysloff, 2003. p.194 David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote she sings along drum and bass rhythms \\"trying to do with techno what vocalese singers did with bebop nearly 50 years ago.\\" Musicologist Sheila Whiteley wrote that \\"the jagged electronic samples and frenetic 140bpm of 'Pluto' creates an uneasy feel.\\" \\"Pluto\\"'s aesthetic is part of the \\"aggressive, macho\\" feeling Bj√∂rk was trying to convey in Homogenic. The track also goes in hand with the album's tribute to her native Iceland; \\"Pluto\\" is inspired by Icelandic mythology. In an interview with David Hemingway, Bj√∂rk said: \\"you have this saga where the Gods get aggressive and the world explodes and everything dies and then the sun comes up and everything starts all over again;\\" referring to Ragnar√∂k. The following and final track, \\"All Is Full of Love\\", stands for that new beginning, \\"like the birds coming out after a thunderstorm,\\" whereas \\"Pluto\\" stands for death. The singer has also described \\"Pluto\\" as about \\"being plastered, that need to destroy everything so you can start again\\". Also available at bjork.frPytlik, 2003. p.190 Lyrically, it has been described as \\"sparse.\\" Bj√∂rk sings: \\"Excuse me/But I just have to/Explode/Explode this body/Off me/I'll be brand new/Brand new tomorrow/A little bit tired/But brand new.\\" Some critics considered the lyrics to be about the contemplation of suicide. Discussing the track, Sheila Whiteley wrote: \\"as anyone who has been through personal trauma knows only too well, rejuvenation often involves a nightmare journey.\\"Whiteley, 2013. p.108 Bj√∂rk's official website also stated that the song is \\"about the liberation of hedonism.\\" Reception \\"Pluto\\" has been met with acclaim from music critics. Although he gave the album a mixed review, Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song to be a highlight of the album, writing it \\"is a heart-poundingly wicked, electronics- driven stunner.\\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani felt that \\"never has the impetus to suicide been captured more thoughtfully or beautifully, at least in song.\\" Peter Buckley thought the song was a stand-out track and that it \\"[emphasizes] her skills as composer, singer and producer.\\"Buckley, 2003. p.97 In the Homogenic review for Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1990s, Dominique Leone of wrote that only in \\"Pluto\\", Bj√∂rk \\"[steps] out from her cocoon in a fit of rage, although even then an air of intrigue envelops the track.\\" Live performances Bj√∂rk presented the song ‚Äîand three more songs off the then-unreleased Homogenic‚Äî at the Tibetan Freedom Concert on 6 June 1997, as a sneak peek of the album. She performed with Mark Bell, who was raised at the rear of the stage surrounded by keyboards and sequencers, and with the Icelandic String Octet conducted by Eumir Deodato at one side of the stage. She wore a pink dress designed by Hussein Chalayan, which she would later wear in the video for \\"Bachelorette\\" and photoshoots. That July, Bj√∂rk performed the whole album for a press conference and presentation concert regarding Homogenic at the Old Truman Building, an old beer factory in London, wearing the same outfit. Also available at nsd.dyndns.org During the brief Homogenic Promotional Tour, which took place from 31 August to 10 September 1997, \\"Pluto\\" was the closing track of the set. The song was part of the set list of the Homogenic Tour which Bj√∂rk embarked with Mark Bell and the Icelandic String Octet from late 1997 to early 1999. A performance of \\"Pluto\\" at the Cambridge Corn Exchange during the tour was included in the video release Live in Cambridge (2001). Bj√∂rk's June 1998 performance of the song in Prague was released in Homogenic Live, a live album of the tour included in the box set Live Box (2003). \\"Pluto\\" was also performed during the Greatest Hits Tour of 2003, which once again featured the Icelandic String Octet, but with the addition of Vespertine World Tour collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins. \\"Pluto\\" was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007‚Äì08), a tour she undertook with Mark Bell, J√≥nas Sen, Damian Taylor, Chris Corsano and a 10 piece female brass band. Several of the concerts were part of festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury and Rock en Seine, among others.

Ebbert published the Pueblo Review and Standard newspaper in 1890, authored the landmark meat inspection legislation in Colorado in 1889 and battled with Prohibitionists in the 1910s. As a Director of the Montezuma Valley Irrigation District from 1911 to 1920, he guided the district through turbulent times and helped engineer its dissolution and reemergence as the Montezuma Valley Irrigation Company in 1920.See, e.g., Montezuma Journal, October 19, 1916, \\"District Suit Being Tried Before Lewis,\\" page 1; Montezuma Journal, November 26, 1914, \\"WB Ebbert Succeeds With State Board,\\" p. 1; Montezuma Journal, October 23, 1919, \\"Notice of Special Election,\\" p. 9. A newspaper article in 1911 touted him as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and perhaps best describes the respect he commanded: \\"His record for good works for Colorado is not excelled by any living man and he would command the respect and wield an influence in the highest legislative body in the land that would be beneficial to not only his state but to the nation at large.\\" Montezuma Journal, April 13, 1911, page 2.

See Legislative Council web biographies on former members at http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/lcsstaff/StaffInfo/LegislatorBiography.htm Ebbert was born in Wheeling, West Virginia. He was the only son of Charlotte Baltzell and John Van Kirk Ebbert, of Fayette County, Pennsylvania.Genealogical information courtesy of Ebbert family and corroborated by official records. After several years in the Union Army, he moved briefly to Covington, Kentucky and the Cincinnati, Ohio area. On Christmas Day, 1866, at age 20, he married Cornelia Blanche Hall in Wheeling. After Cornelia's death in 1881, William B. Ebbert and his three children (Blanche, Edith, and William) moved to the Pueblo, Colorado area and took up farming. He soon met and married Catherine Scheutle in 1884 in Pueblo. William and Catherine produced three more boys in Colorado; all died at prematurely. In Colorado, Ebbert established himself as a community leader, author, and politician.William B. Ebbert: Arriola Farmer-Politician, in Great Sage Plain to Timberline: Our Pioneer History, Vol. I, pp. 87-90, published by Montezuma County Historical Society, Cortez, CO: November 2009. He served several years in the Colorado Legislature, representing Dolores, Otero, Pueblo, and Montezuma counties. Legendary railroad chieftain Otto Mears bestowed upon Ebbert one of his rare silver railroad passes in 1889 (Silverton Railroad Pass No. 193). After a respected life in the military, agriculture, and politics, William B. Ebbert died on February 27, 1927 in Cortez, Colorado. It was just one day before his 81st birthday.

Ebbert as a First Lieutenant at the age of 18. Colonel Weddle then appointed Ebbert as Acting Adjutant. Ebbert fought in many famous American Civil War battles, including battles in the Shenandoah Valley (Winchester, Port Republic, and Second Bull Run). He had lied about his age so he could enlist in the Union Army in 1861 at the age of 15. Ebbert served in the 1st West Virginia Infantry Volunteers, Company A and later in Company H. (His father, John Van Kirk Ebbert, enlisted in 1861 at age 46, and served as a Sergeant in Company I, 1st West Virginia Infantry Volunteers, and later as Corporal, Independent Pennsylvania Battery H, Light Artillery.) Ebbert often faced troops led by Stonewall Jackson, and engaged in battles in the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, under General Shield, General Sheridan, and others. His first engagement was near Winchester on March 25, 1862. He wrote: > we drove back Jackson. We were under the hottest fire at Port Republic > afterwards, where we lost nearly half my company -were defeated, routed, and > pursued for 14 miles by Confederate cavalry, which never ceased firing on us > during our retreat.

As a successful sugar beet farmer, Ebbert battled against big sugar companies for farmers' rights. Ebbert's treatise on dirty politics: \\"Titles are Trash\\" Although Ebbert is most notable for his dealings with agricultural issues, he also tussled with Prohibitionists of the time, culminating in his impassioned writings on the shamefulness of dirty politics and political mudslinging. Ebbert publicly supported local control over the legality of liquor (i.e., the \\"Local Option\\"). Prohibitionists and some clergy sought to unseat him. During the 1910 Assembly elections, the Anti-Saloon League of Denver and various religious leaders targeted Ebbert for defeat. It is in this battle that Ebbert delivered one of his finest political statements to date. After narrowly winning reelection despite an eleventh hour \\"hit piece\\" mailer sent by activist preacher Rev. E.E. McLaughlin, Ebbert retorted: Ebbert as poet Ebbert was known as a great orator and poet and possessed a striking command of the English language. He published his writings in the 1897 book, On Colorado's Fair Mesas. The following poem is published in the book: Clyde Ebbert Walter, Catherine & William B. Ebbert at the Ebbert Ranch circa 1924. Family life: untimely death of children Ebbert reared nine children over a 22-year period. Six of the nine children died prematurely. In Cincinnati: *Louis died of pneumonia at age 9 months; *Cornelia died of cholera at 1 year; and *an unnamed baby boy died at age 23 days. In Colorado: *Wilson died of \\"stomach problems\\" at age 36; *Irving died of diabetes at age 19; and *Wolcott died of leukemia at age 19. Only one son survived: William Dickinson Ebbert (1876‚Äì1951), and two daughters, Blanche (1868‚Äì1952) and Edith (1872‚Äì1946). William Ebbert's first wife Cornelia, circa 1880. She died after childbirth in 1881. Ebbert's first wife Cornelia died on July 5, 1881 in Cincinnati, Ohio a few weeks after the birth of their sixth child. The baby and mother are interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. By 1881, two of William and Cornelia's children had died as infants. While giving birth to their sixth child, Cornelia died. The baby died a few weeks later, making it the third child to die. After Cornelia's death in 1881, Ebbert moved to Colorado and married Catherine Scheutle on July 1, 1884 near Pueblo. The Ebbert Ranch was located outside Cortez, Colorado, near Arriola. The Ebbert clan had lived in several locations in Colorado over the years: first in Pueblo, then Rocky Ford, and later settling in Montezuma County. The Ebbert Ranch was located off U.S. Route 491 (formerly Hwy 666), 9.58 miles north of Cortez, just south of a large irrigation flume that crosses over the freeway. (It is located on the east half of the SW one quarter and lots 3 and 4 of Section 7, Twp. 37, North of Range 16, west of the New Mexico Prime Meridian.)

It is not universally observed, although it is popular among Sephardi and Hasidic Jews. Origin of the custom The Talmudic sages wrote that every Jew should mourn the destruction of the Temple. The origin of the midnight time for prayer and study lies in Psalm 119:62, attributed to David: \\"At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee.\\" It is said that David was satisfied with only \\"sixty breaths of sleep\\" (Sukk. 26b), and that he rose to pray and study Torah at midnight. The custom was fixed as a binding Halakha. At first, Mizrahi Jews would add dirges (kinnot) for the destruction only on the three sabbaths that are between the Seventeenth of Tamuz and Tisha B'Av, and not on weekdays. After discussions that questioned this practice of mourning specifically on the Sabbath, it was decided to discontinue the recitation of the kinnot on these days. Rabbi Isaac Luria canceled the customs of mourning on the Sabbath but declared that the Tikkun Chatzot should be said each and every day. The Shulchan Aruch 1:3 states, \\"It is fitting for every God-fearing person to feel grief and concern over the destruction of the Temple\\". The Mishnah Berurah comments, \\"The Kabbalists have discussed at great lengths the importance of rising at midnight [to say the Tikkun Chatzot, learn Torah, and to talk to God] and how great this is\\".Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim, 1:3. Sephardi communities in Jerusalem have a custom to sit on the floor and recite Tikkun Chatzot after halakhic midday during The Three Weeks. This custom is also mentioned in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, and is practiced in some Ashkenazic communities as well. The Tanya mentions that one should recite Tikkun Chatzot every night if one can. It then suggests that if one cannot do so every night, he should do so on Thursday nights, as a preparation for the Shabbat. Service Tikkun Chatzot is divided into two parts; Tikkun Rachel and Tikkun Leah, named for the two wives of the Patriarch Jacob. On days when Tachanun is not recited during daytime prayers, only Tikkun Leah is recited (although Sefardim do not recite Tikkun Chatzos at all on Shabbat and Yom TovBen Ish Chai, Vayishlach 7 ). The Tikkun Chatzot is an individual service; a minyan is not needed for performing it, although some have the custom to recite it with a minyan. At midnight, one sits on the ground or a low stool, takes off his shoes (non-leather shoes are permitted to be worn, as these are not halakhically considered shoes), and reads from the prayer book. Although the ideal time for Tikkun Chatzot is the hour following midnight, Tikkun Rachel may be said until a half (seasonal) hour before \`alot hashachar/dawn, and Tikkun Leah until dawn.Ben Ish Chai, Vayishlach 4 The Magen Avraham method (also held by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov) is that midnight is six clock hours after nightfall (appearance of 3 medium stars). The method held by Mishnah Berurah is twelve hours after noon (halfway between dawn and dusk). Another way to understand the ideal time for Tikkun Chatzot is at 12:00am midnight (this is another way to understand the Magen Avraham). According to Siddur Beis Yaakov, by Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Psalm 102, the \\"Prayer of the afflicted,\\" is read before reciting Tikkun Rachel. Afterwards, one begins the actual service by reciting the Viddui confession including Ashamnu, and then one reads Psalm 137, \\"By the rivers of Babylon,\\" and Psalm 79, \\"A song of Asaph.\\" Afterwards, verses from the book of Lamentations are read, followed by the kinnot, with customs varying among the communities, the general custom being to recite five or six kinnoth specifically composed for Tikkun Chatzos, some of which were composed by Rabbi Mosheh Alshich. The Tikkun Rachel service is concluded with the reading of Isaiah 52:2, \\"Shake thyself from the dust...\\" A shorter version is usually printed in Sephardic siddurim that does not include the \\"Prayer of the afflicted,\\" and has fewer kinnos. Tikkun Leah consists of various Psalms, and is recited after Tikkun Rachel, or alone on days when tachanun is omitted. The Psalms of Tikkun Leah are Psalm 24, 42, 43, 20, 24, 67, 111, 51, and 126. Psalms 20 and 51 are omitted when Tikkun Rachel is not said. A short prayer concludes the Tikkun. It is common to follow Tikkun Chatzot with learning Torah, in particular Patach Eliyahu or Mishnah. Some learn the last chapter of tractate Tamid. Many study the Holy Zohar.

It was globally distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.. Its release was delayed from original estimates of 2009, Teasers were released by Lego in 2007 and late November 2008 to promote the game, and also in 2009 for one last promotion. The game was available in English and German.. The servers were shut down permanently on January 30, 2012 due to 'unsatisfactory revenue' from within the game's target audience.. Story Plot Lego Universe took place in an alternate universe populated by Lego minifigures. The premise is that years ago, a team of four minifigures went on a great journey to seek the last essence of pure Imagination: Doctor Overbuild, Duke Exeter, Hael Storm, and Baron Typhonus. After having found it on the mysterious planet Crux, the greedy tycoon of the expedition, Baron Typhonus, was pulled into the source, fusing with it to create a maelstrom of chaotic dark energy. However, even though Doctor Overbuild plugged the hole, the stress caused Crux to explode into thousands of other worlds. After the incident, the explorers decided to form their own factions, Doctor Overbuild creating the Assembly, Duke Exeter forming the Sentinels, Hael Storm leading the Venture League, and the Baron's prot√©g√© Vanda Darkflame creating the Paradox. The factions worked together to create the Nexus Force in order to destroy the Maelstrom and its minions. The Venture Explorer, a ship carrying new recruits is being attacked by the Maelstrom. The player, aboard the ship, escapes to Avant Gardens with the aid of Sky Lane. Here, a disaster involving Paradox has infected Avant Gardens with Maelstrom and released a beast called the Spider Queen. After travelling through the world and discovering the Spider Queen's location, the player destroys the Spider Queen at the Block Yard and claims their first Property, where they could place collected models and bricks. Now, members (not free to play) can travel to Nimbus Station, where they choose which faction to join. From there, the player could travel to other worlds like Forbidden Valley or Gnarled Forest. Factions The game consisted of four factions, only one of which a player could join. Each Faction had three specialties that had 3 different ranks and gear. There were two valiant weapons per faction which can be bought at the Nexus Tower. The Sentinels are combat based, using heavy weapons and armor. Their specialties include Knight, Samurai, and Space Ranger. The Venture League is based on exploring, utilizing combinations of light weapons and fast attacks. Their specialties include Daredevil, Buccaneer, and Adventurer. The Assembly focuses on building and creating, using gear that builds weapons. Their specialties include Engineer, Summoner, and Inventor. The Paradox relies on studying the Maelstrom, and using it against itself, mainly using ranged attacks. Their specialties include Space Marauder, Sorcerer, and Shinobi. Worlds Venture Explorer After creating your minifigure, you came to the Venture Explorer. It acted as a tutorial for any newcomers, teaching the basics of running, jumping, and smashing. You ultimately built a rocket and headed off to Avant Gardens with help from Sky Lane. Also, members were able to participate in a \\"Return to the Venture Explorer\\" with difficult enemies such as Hammer Stromlings, Corrupted Sentries, Hammerhurl Stromlings, and Elite Dark Spiderlings; though this was not part of any tutorial. Avant Gardens This is the second world players would visit. It introduces newcomers to the basic mission scenarios and gets them prepared for what they will soon come to face. In addition to the storyline missions, there were side missions and bonus activities such as survival and foot races. Players with memberships saw this as the first zone to see tamable pets in. The Maelstrom minions here are easy, such as the Stromling, Stromling Mech, and the Dark Spiderling, born from the Block Yard's boss, the Spider Queen. The mini-game here is Avant Garden Survival. Here you must survive against Stromlings, Dark Spiderlings, Stromling Mechs, and other enemies more difficult to destroy. Avant Gardens is where you can tame the pets such as Doberman, Triceratops, and Buffalo. The two properties where you can build your creations in Avant Gardens are Block Yard and Avant Grove. Nimbus Station Nimbus Station acted as the Hub for members and was the third world players will visit. Here, you could access most of the other worlds. After the seventh mission, you must select one of the 4 factions (The Assembly, the Sentinels, the Venture League or Paradox.) Here you could enter yourself in a race against other minifigures in the Vertigo Loop racetrack. You could also participate in the Battle of Nimbus Station, an event similar to survival in Avant Gardens but incorporating a wave system and taking place in Nimbus Station's past, fighting off stronger enemies. Members enjoyed many numerous of features in Nimbus Station, including more pet choices. Also there was a rocket pad to Frostbrugh [valid December - February 2010 / 11] near Christmas, the portal to Starbase 3001, and the Lego Club Door [near Red Blocks]. The properties here are Nimbus Rock and Nimbus Isle. The Pets here are Robot Dog and Skunk Pets. There were no enemies on Nimbus Station, except those in the Battle of Nimbus Station. Pet Cove Pet Cove was the key to everything about Pets. It was primarily a hub for players with memberships to learn how to tame Pets and do stunts with their Pets. Obviously, this would be the zone where a large variety of Pets will be available. Gnarled Forest Gnarled Forest was a pirate infested forest-styled zone in which players could experience the shift from beginning features to regular features. Minifigures would learn many new abilities here and unlock many new weapons. This is the first zone that introduces players to guns. The pets that you could get in this world were a tortoise, a boar, a crocodile, an elephant, and a hermit crab. Forbidden Valley Forbidden Valley was unlocked at the same time as Gnarled Forest. It was the first world themed on ninjas, and was primarily rocky, dark, and barren, with many drop-offs and cliffs. The central area of the Forbidden Valley was a huge tree which was a sort of safe zone. It included a mini-game in which the player could fight three dragons. It also introduced several new enemies, such as the Dark Ronin and a type of Dark Ronin which rode a skeleton horse. Nexus Tower Nexus Tower was the hub of everything informational in terms of factions. Here one could accept missions from the faction leader and interact with other things within Nexus Tower. The last piece of the Imagination Nexus is kept here. Like Nimbus Station, Nexus Tower contained no enemies. Crux Prime Crux Prime was the largest of the planetary fragments created in Crux's explosion. Here can you meet many enemies you have met before but in stronger form along with bosses of all varieties (such as Stromling Invaders), and also a myriad of Ninjago Skeletons, straight from the Ninjago Monastery, attempting to mine Maelstrom Crystals. There are only 7 characters that the player can interact with in Crux Prime. Enemies also included the 'leaders' of types of enemy (e.g. Butterscorch, the dragon leader). All leader enemies show up in a slightly different colour from other Crux Prime invaders. The only tameable pet here was the Skeleton Dragon which was tamable as part of the main story line on Crux Prime. Ninjago Monastery The Ninjago Monastery was a new Lego Universe world added to the game within a new build of the game on September 20, 2011. It featured more expansively than Crux Prime the Lego theme Ninjago. The world in comparison to the other worlds was one of the largest. It included the Ninjago Monastery, Skeleton Battlefields and the Ninjago Caves. Players upon arriving followed a chain of missions to learn all four elements of Spinjitsu, from the four ninjas in their temples within the monastery, and help defend the Monastery from skeletons. With the world also came a new crafting feature known as game cooking. A vendor in the Ninjago Monastery traded a special consumable item in exchange for common consumable items found around Lego Universe. Aside from the main mission chain that was to learn Spinjitsu, there were several other sub-plot mission chains available to players. The Ninjago Monastery world included many new daily missions and puzzles. The Ninjago Monastery also included an Earth Dragon Pet that can be tamed after completing certain missions. The Ninjago Monastery was the last major addition to Lego Universe. A battle against Lord Garmadon in the fire temple was planned (and advertised) to be added into the game, but was not rolled out as a result of the server shutdown in January 2012. Gameplay Lego Universe brought players from around the world together to build and fight against the Maelstrom and its minions. The player assumed the role of a Lego minifigure and travelled to various themed worlds, each with different enemies and challenges. Players could collect and earn gear that might be worn and fought with to aid them in achieving a wide range of set goals. Also, players could have Specialties, each one with their unique gear. In addition, minifigures could gain ranks which allow them to use more advanced gear. The accessible full worlds were the pirate-themed Gnarled Forest, faction-oriented Nimbus Station, green and festive Avant Gardens, high-tech Nexus Tower, Maelstrom based Crux Prime, Ninjago's world Ninjago Monastery and the ninja- based Forbidden Valley. Custom-built rocket ships were used by players to travel between these worlds. Three racetracks are found on these worlds that allow players to race against each other with custom race cars. Throughout the game players could collect Lego pieces that can be used to freely build models on their personal properties. Properties could be set to only allow in certain friends or to give access to anybody in the game. Promotion Trailers The original trailer, leaked around early 2008, showed early concepts of the game. These include character customization using the traditional Lego method, a workshop where a car is created from Lego bricks, a Lego city populated with sets from numerous different themes, and a short theatrical battle between an eye-patched Lego minifigure and a \\"Darkling\\". In January 2010, six new gameplay videos, an interview, and another trailer were shown at CES 2010 and released on the internet. A theatrical-style trailer depicting the background story was revealed at the E3 Gaming Expo. Bradford Rant In November 2009, a website for the fictional \\"Bradford-Rant Institute for Cosmic Kinesis\\" was linked on the Lego Universe web page. The institute was supposedly tracking seven Lego \\"Pods\\", which landed in various parts of the United States and Europe. Fans could track and find these pods, all of which landed between November 2009 and early January 2010. Once a pod was found, its data was put up on the Bradford-Rant page. After all of the Pods were found, a new trailer for Lego Universe and the tagline for the game, \\"Answer the Call: Save Imagination,\\" was released. The Great Minifig Mission In January 2010, the Bradford Rant promotion then was turned over to \\"The Great Minifig Mission\\" promotion in which Lego account holders complete missions in order to help minifigs enter the universe. The missions are released at an approximate rate of one every week when the site is updated. When the promotion started, it had a timer ending on April 2, 2010, at 12:00am midnight, GMT, which is April 1 at 8:00pm ET. On March 27, the timer reset to June 2, 2010, at 12:00am GMT, or June 1 at 8:00pm ET. E3 2010 On June 15‚Äì17, 2010, the Lego Universe Team hosted an event at the 2010 E3 Gaming Expo, where attendees could play in the Beta. It was during this event that the global distributor of Lego Universe was announced, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, along with the official release date. Testing Alpha Beginning December 8, 2009, members of the Lego Kids Inner Circle who had been members before December 7 were invited to test the game before the beta started.CES 2010: LEGO Universe Demo, Part 1 - Alpha testing mentioned at 2:28 Before this, the only people who could play the game were Lego employees and their friends and families. The game was in a very early state; only a few worlds were ready for testing, and the parts that were playable had several glitches. As time went on, glitches were fixed, and more worlds were opened. Several concepts tested in the Alpha test did not make it into the Beta and were scrapped. Beta In January 2010, Lego announced that, at the Consumer Electronics Show, there would be a demonstration and sign-ups for beta testing. The link to the closed beta signup page was originally leaked on an LU Producer's Twitter page, allowing some people to sign up for the game before anyone else. The February issue of the Lego Universe newsletter, released soon after, also contained a link to the Beta sign up page for Lego Universe, wherein subscribers were able to sign up for a chance to be in the Beta Test for PC only (though a Mac version was released later on during testing.) Members of My Lego Network on Lego.com also received a message inviting them to the Beta sign ups. In March, the Lego Universe website featured a link on an article directly to the Beta sign ups. Lego Universe beta invites were sent out to the first round of non- alpha testers on March 10; the beta test then ended on September 26 at 7:59 PM EDT (September 29 at 1:00 PM EDT, on the German Server) to prepare for the \\"Founders\\" launch on October 8. Purchase Lego Universe was based on a subscription known as \\"Game-Time\\". A player could choose from one, six, and twelve month subscriptions (the six and twelve-month subscription times rendering special in-game bonuses when bought). Once a user bought a subscription, the Game Time refill code was sent periodically based on the subscription that was purchased, using a process known as auto-renewal. Game Time could also be purchased in the form of non-renewed game cards. Normal order Lego Universe became available for normal order on October 27, 2010. The Normal Order shipped with only the Lego Universe DVD and one month of free game time, though promotions did occasionally arise which provided additional exclusive items. The game was also available for download online, through services such as Steam. Free-to-Play Aside from the normal membership packages the game also offered a free to play option with certain limitations, such as there being only two worlds available for free play, one being Venture Explorer ‚Äî a tutorial world ‚Äî and the other Avant Gardens. You could take part in the fight against the Spider Queen and have temporary gear which involves armour and weapons for each Faction. There was a button that asked players if they wanted to become a full member, where they would get access to everywhere in the Universe and get to do more missions & achievements. Free to play required the user to enter a Lego ID & password and create a character with certain names, whereas members could have their own made-up names. They were also limited on having a maximum 10,000 coins to buy items and food. They did have access to Block Yard where they could build their own creations. They were not allowed to trade with other minifigures, or have more than five friends on their friends list. Many players thought it challenging to increase in level after completing the main story line, nevertheless many players participated in the free-to-play option. The idea for free-to-play came from a fan from the \\"ask Max\\" section of the website. Game server shutdown On Monday, January 30, 2012, precisely at midnight, the Lego Universe servers shut down, and the game is no longer available to play. Jesper Vilstrup, Vice President of Lego Universe, stated, \\"Unfortunately, we have not been able to build a satisfactory revenue model in our target group, and therefore, have decided to close the game.\\" For the last month of Lego Universe, players with membership were offered a month of play at no cost as a 'Thank you' from the Lego Universe Team. A newly titled 'Lego Minifigures Online' MMORPG was released on June 29, 2015 as a successor game until its closure on September 30, 2016.https://www.playminifigures.com/buy/en Reception Lego Universe received a Metacritic score of 70/100 and a GameRankings score of 72.44%.

Many were former members and some were former leaders of the Nazi Party. The JIOA was established in 1945, as a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces. The JIOA comprised one representative from each member agency of the JIC, and an operational staff of military intelligence officers from each military service. The duties of the JIOA included: administrating the Operation Paperclip policies, compiling dossiers (more than 1,500) about Nazi and foreign scientists, engineers, and technicians, and being the liaison to British Intelligence officers executing similar scientific intelligence projects. It also collected, declassified, and distributed reports about German scientific, technical, and industrial intelligence, and the reports of the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS). Moreover, when the CIOS was disbanded, the JIOA assumed much of its work. The Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was disbanded in 1962, after seventeen years of service; most of its Nazi scientist dossiers were transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Among the Paperclip dossiers were those of Magnus von Braun (JIOA dossier RG 330, INSCOM dossier C3001437), Georg Rickhey, Arthur Rudolph, and Walter Schreiber. Yet, the Wernher von Braun dossier is unavailable to the public, because it was excluded from the JIOA documents transferred to the NARA, to wit: \\"Not included among the dossiers is one for rocket scientist Wernher von Braun.

Seegrist killed three people and wounded seven others before being disarmed by a man who was shopping at the mall. The individuals killed included two men and a two-year-old boy. Seegrist was 25 years old and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ten years earlier. Having been committed and discharged from mental care several times, her case stimulated discussion about the state's authority to commit at-risk people into mental care facilities versus individual rights.  Troubled past  At Sylvia Seegrist's trial, her mother Ruth testified that her daughter's paternal grandfather fondled and exposed himself in front of Sylvia when she was 8 years old, and that Ruth had not learned about the sexual abuse until Sylvia was 13. When the two discussed the abuse, Seegrist reportedly told her mother that she didn't know \\"how intimate our relationship was.\\" Seegrist was first hospitalized at the age of sixteen, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was hospitalized a dozen times and, upon each discharge, psychiatrists diagnosed that she no longer posed a risk to herself or others. When she was of age, Seegrist attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army. As she was being inducted, she faced harassment from other members of her platoon, who assumed she was a lesbian; they set her up on a prank date and made her the butt of many jokes thereafter. Seegrist spent a good deal of time at the Springfield Mall, harassing customers and making statements about how \\"good\\" other spree killings were, such as the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre. She was discharged from the Army after two months because of her unusual behavior, which included sitting fully dressed in green fatigues at the spa and sauna of her fitness club. An instructor at the fitness club said \\"she hated everyone and would often talk about shooting and killing people\\".Mother gave warning before mall shooting, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (November 2, 1985) Seegrist's behavior was so disconcerting that clerks at a local K-Mart told her they had no rifles in stock when she tried to purchase one from them. She eventually purchased a Ruger 10/22 at another store.  Shootings Two Ruger 10/22 with rotary magazines; similar to the weapon used by Sylvia Seegrist. On the first of two trips to the Springfield Mall on the day of October 30, 1985 Seegrist shopped for Halloween items at a party store. She then worked out at a fitness club, before returning to the mall for the last time. Seegrist alighted from her vehicle, a Datsun B-210, retrieved the weapon she had purchased, and then fired at a man approximately from where she stood. The man was not hit and having seen the vehicle she arrived in, flattened one of the Datsun's tires to prevent an escape in that vehicle. Meanwhile, Seegrist had approached the nearest entrance and fired at, but missed, a woman who was using a nearby ATM. Before entering the mall, she shot and killed two-year-old Recife Cosmen who was with his parents waiting to eat at a local restaurant. Once inside, Seegrist fired into some stores and ignored others. Though many customers fled when they heard the gunfire, she came across (Ernest) Earl Trout, who either could not or did not hear it and was simply standing in front of a store where he became one of the three people killed that day. Augusto Ferrara was the last person killed in the rampage. John Laufer, a local graduate student, disarmed her as she walked up to him and tried to raise her gun to shoot him. Laufer forced her to a nearby store while he waited for the arrival of mall security. The first guard who responded asked her why she had just done what she did; her reply was \\"My family makes me nervous\\".  Trial  Prior to the competency hearing Seegrist was transferred to Norristown State Hospital for evaluation. On March 6, 1986, Seegrist was deemed competent to stand trial for the killings. Found guilty, but insane, she was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences (one for each victim she killed) and seven consecutive 10-year terms (one for each victim she wounded). The judge had said that Seegrist \\"should spend the rest of her life in some form of incarceration\\". She was sent to the psychiatric specialty hospital Mayview State Hospital for evaluation and was eventually moved to the State Correctional Institution in Muncy, Pennsylvania.  Aftermath  Seegrist's actions helped spur the state government to form a legislative task force, in order to address better ways to care for the mentally ill in the community. Seegrist's mother also urged legislators to make changes to the state mental health laws. The existence or nature of changes made by the task force is unknown. In response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Seegrist's mother Ruth told The Philly Post: At the time of the shootings, gun buyers were required to sign a paper application declaring they had no record of being in a mental institution. Sylvia Seegrist lied on the application and purchased a .22 semi-automatic rifle for $107.00. In 1998, the state of Pennsylvania enacted the Pennsylvania Instant Check System or PICS, enabling licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check using a phone. A reporter from The New York Times sent a letter to Seegrist, asking her to share her thoughts about what happened at the time of the shooting and about her life before she was arrested. Here is an extract from her response: Sylvia Seegrist served her first years of imprisonment at Norristown State Hospital, and then transferred to Muncy State Prison for women. Ruth Seegrist and her ex-husband visited Sylvia regularly at Muncy and she seemed to welcome the visits. But about 1992, Sylvia Seegrist had severe difficulties with her antipsychotic medication. Her mother is not sure what medication she is taking now, but around 1997 Sylvia made a decision to stop any contact with her family members. Visits and phone calls ended, the last letter Ruth Seegrist sent to her daughter was on Nov. 30. Sylvia has not replied. \\"It's her illness,\\" said Ruth Seegrist, 67 (2002), \\"She's schizophrenic and psychotic and becomes extremely paranoid. She dwells on things in the past. Since I was her closest family member, I got blamed: She did what she did because of me!\\" Seegrist's Muncy Prison counselor meets her at least every two weeks. Her counselor notes that Sylvia takes her meds, spends time at the library, exercises a lot and takes steps to keep herself sharp. Sylvia Seegrist's precursor to the shooting was due to her fear that her mother was trying hard to have her sent to a mental care facility again. She said that she would \\"rather die or go to prison than go to a mental hospital.\\" Ruth Seegrist said she had seen A Beautiful Mind, a 2001 biographical drama film about John Nash, a Princeton math professor and Nobel laureate who also was schizophrenic. \\"I thought it was very well done,\\" Seegrist said. \\"When a person is so delusional ‚Äì at first he thought it all was real, but it really was in his mind.\\" Ruth Seegrist said \\"I really believe she belongs in the forensic unit of a hospital, not in prison,\\" she also shared \\"They should be incarcerated in the forensic unit of a hospital ... until they get functional and stabilized.

It is often acclaimed as America's first bestseller. Plot The Wide, Wide World is a work of sentimentalism about the life of young Ellen Montgomery. The story begins with Ellen's happy life being disrupted by the fact that her mother is very ill and her father must take her to Europe, requiring Ellen to leave home to live with an almost- unknown aunt. Though Ellen tries to act strong for her mother's sake, she is devastated and can find solace in nothing. Eventually the day comes when Ellen must say goodbye to her mother and travel in the company of strangers to her aunt's home. Unfortunately these strangers are unkind to Ellen and she tries to leave the boat on which they are traveling. An old man sees Ellen crying and tells her to trust in God. He teaches her about being a Christian, as her mother had done, and asks her if she is ready to give her heart to Jesus. After talking with the man, Ellen becomes determined to become a true Christian, which gives her strength for the rest of the journey to her aunt's place in Thirwall. On Ellen's first night in Thirwall, she learns that her father forgot to inform her aunt that she was coming, so a \\"Mr. Van Brunt\\" escorts her to her aunt's home. This aunt, Fortune Emerson, proves to be quite different from Ellen's loving mother: she treats Ellen unkindly and refuses to let her attend school. Ellen hates living with Fortune and comes to find comfort in the society of Mr. Van Brunt and other neighbors as she becomes more familiar with her new surroundings. One day, discovering that her aunt withheld a letter from Mrs. Montgomery, Ellen runs crying into the woods. There she meets Alice Humphreys, the daughter of a local minister. Alice is kind to Ellen and invites her to tea the next day, to give Ellen a chance to tell her troubles; maybe Alice would be able to help. The girls become fast friends and Alice adopts Ellen as a sister, offering to educate her and guide her spiritually, teaching her to forgive others and trust in the Lord. Alice and her brother John, who is away at school much of the time, treat Ellen like family, even inviting her to spend Christmas in the nearby town of Ventnor with them and their friends, the Marshmans. While there, Ellen meets another Ellen, Ellen Chauncey. She also gets better acquainted with John Humphreys, who comforts her many times after the other children tease her. Ellen comes to realize that if she hadn't needed to be separated from her mother, she might never have met Alice and John. About a year later, one day when Ellen visits town, she overhears from some ladies' conversation that her mother has died. Devastated, she turns to Alice and her Bible for comfort. She stays with Alice and John until Aunt Fortune becomes ill and Ellen must look after her. Eventually Aunt Fortune recovers and Ellen returns to Alice and her other friends. After Mr. Van Brunt's mother dies, he decides to marry Aunt Fortune; soon after, Alice tells Ellen that she is very ill and will soon be \\"going home\\" to Heaven; Ellen is not to grieve for her but to trust in God. She also invites Ellen to take her place in the Humphreys household. Ellen immediately moves in and begins by nursing Alice through her final weeks. After Alice dies, Ellen turns to John for guidance. He takes over as her tutor, spiritual advisor, and guiding light. By the time a Humphreys relative dies in England and John must travel overseas to handle the family's business, Ellen (though sad to see him go) is a stronger person. One day Nancy visits Ellen, bringing letters she has found while cleaning Fortune's house. They are for Ellen from her mother and express the wish that Ellen go live with relatives in Scotland; after sharing the letters with Mr. Humphreys, Ellen decides she must honor her parents' wishes so the Humphreys send her to Scotland to live with the Lindsays: her grandmother and uncle Lindsay and Lady Keith. They welcome her into their home and find her delightful, but they become very possessive of her and force her to denounce her identity as an American and as a Montgomery. Mr. Lindsay even makes Ellen call him ‚Äúfather‚Äù and refers to her as his ‚Äúown little daughter.‚Äù The Lindsays also discourage Ellen's faith, as they don‚Äôt see religion as being important to someone Ellen's age. Ellen finds it hard to live without her daily hours set aside for studying religion, but still tries hard to live by her faith and everything that John and Alice taught her. Ellen misses John more than anything, and during a New Year's Eve party at the Lindsays', he shows up asking for her. The Lindsays try to keep them apart, but they are unsuccessful. During their emotional reunion John reminds Ellen to keep her faith; in a few years, when she will be able to choose where she lives, she can return to America and live with him. When Ellen introduces John to the Lindsays, they actually become fond of him. John must soon return to America, but not without promising Ellen that they will be together forever soon. In an unpublished chapter at the end of the book, Ellen returns to America as Mrs. John Humphreys. Characters Primary Characters: * Ellen Montgomery: The story's protagonist. Young and na√Øve at the story's beginning, Ellen lives happily with her mother as her sole companion and teacher. After being torn away from her mother, Ellen struggles to learn to love God and live a Christian life in the face of adversity. * Mrs. Montgomery: Ellen's mother. Plagued with health problems, Mrs. Montgomery finds comfort only in Ellen and God. Although unable to perform many of the duties of a mother and wife, she does her best to teach Ellen about God and how to be a lady. * Fortune Emerson: Captain Montgomery's half-sister is stern and unfeeling towards Ellen from the beginning. She refuses to let Ellen attend school and even withholds her mother's letter from Ellen. * Alice Humphreys: Daughter of a minister. Kind and gentle, she becomes Ellen's companion and spiritual counselor and helps Ellen find solace in the Lord while living with Aunt Fortune. Eventually Alice becomes sick and dies, but not before teaching Ellen to learn to trust in God. * John Humphreys: Alice's beloved brother. A handsome and charming young man, he becomes as close as a brother to Ellen (as Alice becomes as close as a sister). After Alice's death, John becomes Ellen's guide through the world, teaching her how to be a good Christian and a good person. * The Lindsays: Ellen's family on her mother's side. Grandmother Lindsay; and Mr. Lindsay and Lady Keith, Ellen's uncle and aunt; adopt her readily into their family but become extremely possessive of her and make her denounce her identity as an American and a Montgomery. They also discourage Ellen's devotion to her faith. Secondary Characters * Captain Montgomery: Ellen's negligent father was often away from home and felt little sympathy for wife or daughter during their forced separation. * Mr. Van Brunt: Fortune's farmhand. He is intimidating at first, though Ellen learns to love him. He feels kindly towards Ellen, often defending her when her aunt mistreats her. * Nancy Vawse: A girl who lives nearby with her grandmother, she is thought by most to be \\"a bad sort\\"; though Ellen doesn't like her at first, she proves later to be a better person. * Mrs. Vawse: Nancy's grandmother, a kindly old lady who lives on a mountain. She teaches French to Ellen and Alice and later cares for Ellen after Alice dies and John returns to school. * Mr. Humphreys: Alice and John's father, a local minister. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, though Ellen becomes like a daughter to him and comforts him after Alice dies. * The Marshmans: Humphreys-family friends who live in a nearby town. They are kind to Ellen and treat her well when she is with them. * Ellen Chauncey: A young girl Ellen meets while staying with the Marshmans. * Margery: Alice's loyal servant who came from England with the Humphreys. She helps Ellen learn to take Alice's place in the household. Themes This book was originally written with the goal of teaching people a Christian lesson, so many of the themes are Christian in nature and aim to show people how a true Christian ought to live his or her life. * One of themes present in The Wide, Wide World is that everything in life, even the bad things, is caused by God and leads to something good, especially in the spiritual sense. Ellen is very sad when she learns that her mother must leave, but reminds herself that the trip will make her mother healthy again. When she goes to the store to try and buy some merino cloth, she meets a salesman who treats her very badly and makes her cry, but as a result she gets to know a generous old gentleman who provides her with certain things for her trip that she might not have gotten otherwise. On the steamboat, the other girls make fun of Ellen and send her crying off to another part of the boat, but through this she met a man who teaches her many things about Christianity. When at the Marshmans‚Äô house, she meets children who give her a hard time with her faith, but her friend Alice and Ellen Chauncey are there for her and comfort her. Through this theme, Susan Warner wanted people to see that God did not send misery upon his children for no reason, but used suffering as a means to bring them closer to Him. Ellen learns this and is better able to cope with problems in her life. * Another theme present in the novel is that there are always good people present among the bad folks. Mr. Saunders, a cold-hearted clerk, is contrasted with an old gentleman who is very kind to Ellen. Captain Montgomery, a man who doesn't seem to care much for his daughter or her mother, is married to Mrs. Montgomery, a kind woman who loves Ellen with all of her heart. Ellen is forced to travel with Mrs. Dunscombe and her daughters, who find pleasure in mocking Ellen and her less-than-ideal clothes. After leaving them, Ellen meets a young man who spends lots of time with Ellen, teaching her about becoming a Christian and sincerely caring for the little girl. Aunt Fortune, who makes it obvious that Ellen is unwanted at her house, lives close to Mrs. Van Brunt, an older woman who cares for Ellen and acts kindly to her. Ellen meets people at the Marshmans‚Äô Christmas party who give her a hard time on purpose, but she has many friends there as well. This seems to be saying that even though a person might be surrounded with bad people who make everyone around them suffer, there are still many kind people in this world that will offer their help when the time comes. Ellen meets many different kinds of people throughout the story, some of which are annoying and taunt her faith in God, but some who become real friends and shape Ellen's personality. * A third theme that is present in this book is that those who desire to grow spiritually will receive the help of God if they honestly have that desire. When talking to her mother before the parting, Ellen is determined to live a perfect, Christian life and be an example for everyone around her. However, as soon as she gets on the boat, she discovers that her heart holds negative feelings towards the people around her. After meeting the Christian man on the boat, she realizes how hard her heart is, and her desire to live a good life is rekindled. She fails at this again, however, when she gets to Aunt Fortune's house, where she directly disobeys her aunt and throws fits when things aren't done to her liking. But she realizes her mistakes and wants to be good, and God sends her a young woman who acts as a spiritual guide for the girl. Through this, Warner was telling people not to give up when they made mistakes, and showing how God comes to those who seek him. Since The Wide, Wide World is a Christian book, it aimed to teach readers how seek God and encourage those who didn‚Äôt exactly know how to go about doing that, but had a true desire to be closer to Him. * Another theme seen in the story is that God has an unlimited supply of strength, and is willing to give it to anyone who desires it. Poor Ellen went through just about everything in her life. By the age of 10, she was separated from her mother forever, mistreated at the hands of others, mocked for her faith in God, and forced to move from her homeland. However, instead of whining and complaining she asks God to help her, and she is not left alone in this world. Warner knew that times weren‚Äôt easy for everyone, just like today, and wanted people to know that there was an everlasting source of encouragement available at any time of day, anywhere in the world. She uses Ellen as an example, who doesn‚Äôt despair but, with God's help, lives happily after she marries John. Conflicts The driving conflict of this story is the separation of Ellen from her mother and the effects of this separation on Ellen, including how she misses the mother who had meant everything to her, how she struggles with being a good Christian, and how she deals with people who don‚Äôt care about her. * Woman vs. Self As a work of sentimentalist literature, the conflict created by the story is dealt with almost entirely through the emotional response that Ellen has to the conditions in which she is put in the novel. In this, the main conflicts that Ellen encounters deals with how she can internally deal with each of the emotional problems she is met with in a way that is characteristic of strength and perseverance. * Woman vs. Nature Ellen's mother leaving for France due to her sickness is the conflict which sets the entire narrative in motion, which occurs at the very start of the story. The first few chapters deal with how Ellen prepares to cope with the separation while simultaneously ensuring that, on the advice of the doctor, she refrains from causing any extra stress or fatigue on her mother. After her departure, Ellen must come to terms with being able to survive without the one person who truly cared for her. * Woman vs. God With her mother's departure, Ellen finds herself doubting God's intentions, and struggles with the idea that she must love God despite the hardships he has given her, chiefly being separated from her mother, and attempt to come to terms with the idea that God has separated Ellen from her mother and sent her to her aunt in order to be taught that strong faith in God is the most important aspect in her life, over and above her love for her mother. * Woman vs. Society Most of the personal conflicts with other characters are also dealt with in the internal manner, chiefly the struggles Ellen has in dealing with her callous and uncaring Aunt Fortune, who shows no sympathy for Ellen's sadness in being detached from her mother immediately upon meeting. Aunt Fortune's disregard for the feelings of Ellen leads to most of the external turmoil Ellen faces in the first half of the book, including her indifference to allow Ellen to go to school. Literary Style There are three main aspects which created Warner's particular writing style in The Wide, Wide World. The first aspect is the time in which the book was written. With Webster having furthered the development of the American dialect with his 1828 publication of the first American dictionary, America was still gaining its own literary voice in 1850 when The Wide, Wide World was published. It is readily apparent from the first page that this novel's style is archaic with lines such as \\"Driven thus to her own resources, Ellen betook herself to the window and sought amusement there.\\" Baym, Nina. Woman's Fiction: A Guide to Novels by and about Women in America, 1820-1870. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978. The next aspect of Warner's style is that The Wide, Wide World is also a didactic piece. Warner's style was aimed at giving an accurate portrayal of the social limitations imposed upon nineteenth-century women, and aimed at promoting the benefits of Christian morality. The Wide, Wide World was republished in 1987 by the Feminist Press, showing the claims it holds to furthering gender equality. And one can see that Warner's style was aimed at promoting Christian morals because one of the main themes of this novel is about finding strength in religious devotion. The Wide, Wide World is a paradigm of sentimentalist literature. The conflict and action of this story are largely introverted within the protagonist Ellen. The lines ‚ÄúDressing was sad work to Ellen today; it went on very heavily. Tears dropped into the water as she stooped her head to the basin,‚Äù are found in a four-page stretch within which Ellen cries on five separate occasions, displaying how sentimental Warner's style was. Along with being a piece of sentimentalist literature, the work is considered an example of the domestic novel. The Wide, Wide World adheres to the basic plot of most women's fiction novels of the time, which, as Nina Baym describes the genre in Woman's Fiction, involves \\"the story of a young girl who is deprived of the supports she had rightly or wrongly depended on to sustain her throughout life and is faced with the necessity of winning her own way in the world.‚Äù History \\"Published at the end of 1850, The Wide, Wide World by Susan Warner went through fourteen editions in two years, and may ultimately have been as popular as Uncle Tom's Cabin with 19th century American readers\\". Although it was first rejected by many publishers, Warner's first novel became an instant sensation among its readers. The novel paints an excellent picture of the Victorian era of the United States, and so the readers of the time appreciated its relevancy to their own lives. (Jo March reads the book in Little Women). Pushing Christian values and themes, The Wide, Wide World was a guide to young ladies of the time who were encouraged to have submissive and humble attitudes towards their elders, especially men. The novel also portrayed a part of the author's own life: While Ellen's mother died when Ellen was young, Warner's mother had died when Warner was nine years old. Warner then went to live with her aunt, who was much kinder than Ellen's Aunt Fortune.\\"The Wide, Wide World, Susan Warner: INTRODUCTION.\\" Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed.

History  The first Australian InterVarsity Choral Festival took place in 1950 when the Sydney University Musical Society (SUMS) hosted the Melbourne University Choral Society (MUCS) for a week-long rehearsal camp culminating in a combined concert. Other university choirs joined over the years, with all State and Territory capitals (except Darwin in the Northern Territory) having at least one member choir by 1973. The IVCF has since become the largest regularly occurring choral festival in Australia. From 1975 on, when the 26th IVCF performed Verdi's Requiem in the then recently opened Sydney Opera House, IVCFs have striven to perform large-scale works to high standards with professional orchestras where appropriate and available. The 37th IVCF (Brisbane, 1986) was the first to work with its state's peak professional orchestra, the then Queensland Symphony Orchestra, the major work on the program being Herbert Howells' Hymnus Paradisi. Two years later (1988), to celebrate Australia's bicentennial, the 39th IVCF collaborated with the Sydney Philharmonia and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Charles Dutoit to perform Mahler's Symphony number 8 (\\"Symphony of a Thousand\\"), again in the Sydney Opera House. More recently, the 55th IVCF (Perth, 2004) took part in the Perth International Arts Festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k by performing his Stabat Mater with the Prague Chamber OrchestraPKO ‚Äì Prague Chamber Orchestra, Czech Republic. under Australian conductor Graham Abbott. Promotion of Australian composition IVCFs have a long if intermittent tradition of performance of works by Australian composers. At least sixteen performances since 1962 have included works commissioned by the festival, including Blue Gum Forest, composed by Matthew Orlovich for the 60th IVCF in 2009, Missa Pacifica by Anne Boyd, commissioned for the Sydney IVCF in 2008, and David Cassat's \\"Flesh to Stone\\" for semichorus and divisi main chorus, commissioned by the 56th IVCF (Melbourne) in 2005. Many other InterVarsity Choral Festivals have included premiere performances of works, including Paul Stanhope's \\"Pirramimma\\" for three choirs and string ensemble, performed in 2007 in Brisbane through a collaboration between the 58th IVCF and the Bonyi International Youth Festival.  Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association  The organization behind the IVCF is the Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association (AICSA), which is a non-profit that represents each of the affiliated local choirs, with a purpose of encouraging choral music within tertiary academic settings. While officially formed in 1973, organizational cooperation to create the IVCF has existed since 1950. Since being officially formed, AICSA has acquired an increased role. Today, besides assisting in the organisation of the festival, it sponsors a database catalogue of music held by individual choirs, archives at the National Library of Australia, and internet resources via aicsa.org.au. The newsletter Erato was published 3-5 times a year from 1971 to 2012.

It is named after mystery writer Mickey Spillane, whose novels featuring detective Mike Hammer provided the basis for the album's title track. Zorn wrote Spillane on a series of index cards, each containing an outline or instruction for the musicians that was intended to evoke scenes from one of Spillane's novels. One card states: \\"Scene of the crime #1 -- high harp harmonics, basses and trombone drone, guitar sonorities, sounds of water dripping and narration on top.\\"John Bracket.

An Italian and a French officer and three Italian non- commissioned officers were killed. Another ECMM helicopter flying in formation with the attacked helicopter made an emergency landing. The second helicopter carried a crew and a visiting diplomat, all of whom survived. The incident was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and the EC. As a result of the incident, the Yugoslav authorities suspended the head of the air force, and the Yugoslav defense minister, General Veljko Kadijeviƒá, resigned his post. The events followed the end of the first stage of the war in Croatia and closely preceded the country's international recognition. The MiG-21 pilot, Lieutenant Emir ≈†i≈°iƒá, disappeared after the incident. He was tried in absentia together with his superiors by Croatian authorities, convicted, and sentenced to extended imprisonment. ≈†i≈°iƒá was subsequently arrested in Hungary in 2001 and extradited to Italy, where he was tried, convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2006, he was turned over to Serbia for the remainder of the sentence, but released in 2008. Two other Yugoslav officers were tried in absentia in Italy and convicted in 2013, while Serbia was ordered to pay monetary damages to the victims' families. The victims were posthumously decorated by Italy and France, respectively. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centered on the predominantly Serb- populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. Following the Pakrac clash between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. The Brioni Agreement established an observer mission which was eventually called the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the disengagement of belligerents in the Ten-Day War in neighbouring Slovenia, and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western Slavonia, injuring one of the pilots. This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, and a month later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). The fiercest fighting of the war occurred around this time, when the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In November, Croatia, Serbia and the JNA agreed upon the Vance plan entailing a ceasefire, protection of civilians in specific areas designated as United Nations Protected Areas, and the presence of UN peacekeepers in Croatia. The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992. In December 1991, the European Community (EC) announced its decision to grant formal diplomatic recognition to Croatia as of 15 January 1992. Incident Austrian Armed Forces radar plot of the incident On 7 January 1992, a pair of Italian Army Agusta-Bell AB-206L LongRanger helicopters operated by ECMM observers entered Croatian air space from Hungary. The helicopters were white- painted and unarmed. They were flying from the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to Zagreb via Kaposv√°r, Hungary. Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they were not allowed to fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihaƒá, Bosnia and Herzegovina. An Italian Army Agusta- Bell AB-206 similar to the one involved in the incident After the two helicopters were spotted by a Yugoslav Air Force tracking radar near Bihaƒá, a pair of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s, which were on standby at the ≈Ωeljava Air Base near Bihaƒá, were ordered to take off and intercept the aircraft. The MiG-21s, assigned to the 125th Squadron of the 117th Fighter Aviation Regiment, were piloted by Lieutenant Emir ≈†i≈°iƒá and Captain Danijel Boroviƒá. However, Boroviƒá declared that his aircraft had a problem with its engine, and ≈†i≈°iƒá took off alone. ≈†i≈°iƒá was guided to the incoming helicopters at an altitude of , and then ordered to make a full circle with his jet. As he turned around, he spotted the helicopters flying below his plane, at an altitude of . ≈†i≈°iƒá requested further orders and was told to shoot the helicopters down. The order was issued by the duty officer at the ≈Ωeljava Air Base, Lieutenant Colonel Dobrivoje Opaƒçiƒá. ≈†i≈°iƒá pursued the helicopters, firing aircraft gun in front of the helicopters, but his aircraft was not armed with tracer ammunition and the helicopter pilots were not able to observe that they were fired upon. Flying at a speed of , he switched to missiles and registered that the missile seekers had acquired the targets. ≈†i≈°iƒá fired two infrared homing R-60 missiles. One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter. The helicopter was shot down near the village of Podrute, located in an area administered by the city of Novi Marof, north of Zagreb. The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack. Aftermath Five ECMM observers were killed in the attack, including four Italians and one Frenchman. The victims were Lieutenant Colonel Enzo Venturini, helicopter pilot, Staff Sergeant Marco Matta, co-pilot, Sergeant Major Fiorenzo Ramacci, Sergeant Major Silvano Natale, and Ship-of-the-line Lieutenant Jean-Loup Eychenne. The Italian personnel were drawn from the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\". The second helicopter carried a diplomat and three Italian ECMM observers, none of whom were harmed. The crash site was toured by the police, ECMM staff and journalists, and EC representatives visited Belgrade to receive a report on the incident from Yugoslav authorities. The action of the Yugoslav Air Force was condemned by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Nations Security Council, and the EC Council of Ministers. The Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia was recalled to Rome for consultations. Subsequently, Italy cancelled an air traffic agreement with Yugoslavia, causing Jat Airways to cancel Belgrade‚ÄìRome flights. In addition, ECMM operations were suspended for several days. Yugoslav Ministry of Defence announced that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action. The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjeviƒá was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijeviƒá officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. ≈†i≈°iƒá was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, ≈†i≈°iƒá claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after being hit by a fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter. His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses, as well as ≈Ωeljava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft were flying to Zagreb. ≈†i≈°iƒá and Opaƒçiƒá were tried in absentia in Croatia, and both were convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Boroviƒá, who defected to Croatia a month after the attack, testified against ≈†i≈°iƒá. ≈†i≈°iƒá was arrested by Hungarian police at the Horgo≈°‚ÄìR√∂szke border crossing on 9 May 2001. His extradition was requested by both Croatia and Italy. He was ultimately extradited to Italy in June 2002, where he was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for five counts of homicide and causing an aircraft disaster. In 2006, he was transferred to Serbia for the remainder of the prison term. He was released by Serbian authorities in 2008. In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opaƒçiƒá, General Ljubomir Bajiƒá, commander of the 5th Aviation Corps, and Colonel Bo≈æidar Martinoviƒá, head of the Yugoslav Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade in absentia for the attack. Opaƒçiƒá and Bajiƒá were convicted and each sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Martinoviƒá was acquitted. The court also ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 Euros. In a 2008 interview, ≈†i≈°iƒá said he regretted the deaths of the crew but felt no remorse for his actions. On 25 May 1993, Italy posthumously decorated the four Italian ECMM observers killed in the attack with the Gold Medal of Military Valor, and the surviving three Italians aboard the second helicopter with the Silver Medal of Military Valor. Eychenne was posthumously promoted to lieutenant commander effective 7 January 1992, and attributed Mort pour la France on 14 April of the same year. He was decorated as the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. The incident is commemorated annually in Podrute and the ceremonies held there are regularly attended by representatives of the Croatian government and military, representatives of Italian and French Armed Forces, along with European Union, French and Italian diplomats.

It usually has golden yellow flowers in profusion and needle-shaped leaves. Description Hakea nodosa is an erect, sprawling shrub usually growing to tall and a similar width. The branchlets quickly form ribbing or slowly becoming smooth. The leaves are usually needle-shaped, sometimes flattened, flexible, long and wide. The leaves are occasionally grooved below and smooth ending in a point long. The inflorescence consists of 2-11 cream- white to golden yellow flowers in profusion, clustered along the branches. The inflorescence is on a simple stem densely covered with upright hairs, they may be white, brown or a combination of both. The pedicels are long with white, soft, silky hairs. The pistil long, the perianth is smooth and long. These are followed by woody seed capsules that are 30 to 35 mm long. Two contrasting types of the latter are produced, one that is woody with contrasting lighter bumps, and the other that is smooth, not woody and opens while still attached to the branch. Flowering occurs from May to August. Taxonomy and naming Hakea nodosa was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word nodosus meaning \\"knotty\\", referring to the prominent knobs on the fruit. Distribution and habitat Yellow hakea occurs in south-eastern South Australia, Victoria and north-eastern Tasmania in dense heath woodlands, usually in winter wet locations on clay soil. Cultivation Yellow hakea is adaptable to a wide range of soils and climatic conditions and will grow well in full sun or part shade.

She was the daughter of John Harris, an English-born ex-convict who had been sentenced to death for stealing eight silver spoons but was ultimately transported to Australia on the First Fleet. Her mother's identity isn't known for sure but she was probably also a convict. One biographer speculates her name was Mary Green and Elizabeth was actually born Elizabeth Green on 24 December. Neither parent played a significant part in her upbringing. Her father set sail for England in 1801 and left Elizabeth and her sister Hannah in the care of James Larra, a prominent Sydney merchant and ex-convict, and his wife Susannah. Elizabeth was later described as the niece of Larra and it may be that her mother was sister to either Larra or his wife. In 1812, she married wealthy Scottish merchant Walter Lang and they had two sons before Walter died in 1816. The second son John George Lang was the first published novelist born in Australia. In 1819, she married Joseph Underwood, a merchant and sealer whose wife had died the year before leaving him with a number of children to look after. Joseph and Elizabeth had a further six children of their own so it was fortunate that, just before his marriage to Elizabeth, he had bought a large house and property, Ashfield Park, from fellow merchant Robert Campbell. After Joseph's death in 1833, the family began to encounter financial difficulties and considered subdividing their large estate. Cannily, Elizabeth advertised the sale as the formation of the village of Ashfield and paid for the construction of the Anglican Church herself. Many streets in northern Ashfield bear the names of her children including Frederick, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Julia and Joseph. Prior to the subdivision, the area was commonly known as Underwood's Bush and Underwood's Creek (later Iron Cove Creek and now a stormwater drain) was a popular picnic spot along Parramatta Road. Elizabeth died in 1858 and was buried by the rector Thomas Wilkinson in the graveyard of the church she built, St John's.

However, it contained around 700 tonnes of fuel oil, 38 tonnes of diesel and 40 tonnes of lube oil, which if released could have caused an ecological problem. During further stormy weather, the ship was pushed onto the beach so that it was almost parallel to the beach, and both bow and stern were stuck on the sand. The whole ship was then completely trapped between the beach and a rocky reef. In the first week the salvage crew loaded the ship with ballast water, which sunk it lower, so that its hull was firmly on the seabed. Its location on a popular beach and close proximity to the Newcastle CBD made Pasha Bulker a tourist destination and precipitated a minor economic boom. One radio station promoted a song called \\"Blame it on the Pasha Bulker\\", a rewrite of the song, \\"Blame it on the Bossa Nova\\". Pasha Bulker was even advertised on eBay for a short time, with bids reaching $16,000,000 before eBay closed the auction.; While beached, Pasha Bulker was used as a billboard for slogans by Greenpeace on 27 June 2007. Lasers beamed messages such as \\"Coal causes climate change chaos\\" and \\"This is what climate change looks like\\" in red on the side of the ship. Greenpeace stated that the protest was motivated by unnamed \\"scientists tell[ing] us that storm surges of the type that we saw earlier this month are something that we can expect more of as a result of climate change.\\"  Salvage operation   Planning  A helicopter operating above the beached ship Svitzer, a Danish company, was awarded the contract to salvage the bulk carrier.} On 9 June 2007 a salvage team, led by Drew Shannon, boarded the ship to assess the condition of the hull. Salvage investigators confirmed on 11 June 2007 that the outer shell of the ship's double hull had been breached and was taking on water on the starboard side. It was decided that the refloating attempt would proceed despite concerns that the ship was too badly damaged to be refloated. Any attempt at moving the ship was to occur at high tide, when the ship's own buoyancy would reduce the towing force required and the chance of it breaking into two.; The salvage attempt was not to involve removing any of the fuel or oil off the vessel. The plan to salvage Pasha Bulker used anchors laid out at sea, which the ship was to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it with the aim of dragging the bow over a rock reef. The carrier would then be pulled seaward in a path between two rocky reefs. A hydrographic survey was conducted to survey and map the bottom of the ocean through the surf zone using a surf ski single beam echo sounder and GPS. This gave the salvage team more insight into the direction for refloating the ship. An emergency response team was to remain on standby should the vessel begin leaking fuel and an exclusion zone was set up around the location of the ship with marker buoys to stop all ships and surfers from entering the area. In addition on 25 June 2007 an air exclusion zone was created around the ship. Aerial view of Newcastle showing Nobby's Beach and coal terminals Various attempts for refloating the ship were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between grains of sand and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether this would have been effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled up and over the rocks.  First attempt  Final preparations to refloat the ship began on 28 June 2007 when the ballast water, added earlier to stabilise the vessel, was pumped out to aid buoyancy. At around 5.30pm AEST the tug boats began pulling on the lines attached to the bow on the port side and the ship appeared to move for the first time. An ocean swell up to pounded the ship and caused the bow to move back and forth even when tethered to the tug boats. Soon after the attempt started to shift the ship, one of the cables connecting the ship to the tug boat Keera snapped dashing the attempt. This resulted in the decision to make another attempt after the salvage crews could regroup. Salvage efforts on the morning of 29 June 2007 were hampered by more cables snapping, this time it was cables attached to the \\"Supertug\\" Pacific Responder and a sea anchor. Ballast water was reloaded to help preserve the initial gains that were made and the next attempt to move the ship was deferred to the evening of 1 July 2007 to allow salvage engineers more time to secure new cables to the tugs and between the winches and sea anchors.;  Second attempt  The position of Pasha Bulker on the morning after the second refloat attempt. Three salvage tugs managed to rotate Pasha Bulker so that it was now facing deep water and was only a few degrees short of being able to clear the reef. At its new position, the bulker was only from water deep enough to refloat the vessel and get it away. However, two separate oil slicks were detected in the vicinity of Pasha Bulker, prompting concerns about a potential oil spill. The oil spill ship Shirley Smith was dispatched to assess the threat of an oil leak while the salvage operations were suspended. It was later determined that the liquid was simply lubricating oil expelled from the suspended propeller and snapped rudder; it was washed into the ocean with westerly winds.; ;  Third attempt and successful reflotation  The ship was successfully towed off the reef on the third attempt at approximately 9:37pm AEST on 2 July 2007. By 9:41pm it was offshore. It was then held from the Newcastle shoreline and inspected by divers for oil spills and to determine the extent of the hull damage.  Damage assessment and repairs  In addition to large creases that were visible on both sides of the outer hull while the ship was beached, propeller and rudder damage became evident during the operation to remove the ship from the beach. Assessment by divers while the ship was being held offshore determined that one of the ballast tanks was flooded. Minor repairs to Pasha Bulker were conducted in Newcastle harbour before the ship was towed by the Japanese supertug Koyo Maru for major repairs in Japan.  Post- reflotation events  After the ship was refloated, questions as to who would pay for the recovery of the ship were raised. On 4 July 2007 it was announced that the Japanese owners had promised to pay for the total cost of the salvage in accordance with international conventions. The ship was towed into Newcastle harbour where minor repairs were carried out while a decision on where major repairs would be completed was made. Salvage costs of A$1.8 million were finally paid in July 2008. The New South Wales government did not press charges against the master because negligence could not be proved \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\". A NSW Maritime report found horrendous weather conditions combined with poor seamanship by the master of the vessel were to blame. At the height of the incident the ship's master had left the bridge to have breakfast. The report said the master failed to realise the impact of the forecast weather in the anchorage even though wind warnings were received as early as 3 June 2007. The master also did not ballast the ship for heavy weather.  Departure  Pasha Bulker left the port of Newcastle on 26 July 2007. Four kilometres out to sea the Japanese salvage tug Koyo Maru connected lines to Pasha Bulker for it to be towed back to Japan. Metal beams could be seen reinforcing the buckled hull, as these were part of the temporary repair solution affixed at Newcastle. In 2008, Pasha Bulker was renamed Drake. The vessel has since been repaired and returned to service.  Safety investigation  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau released a report into the grounding, which includes analysis of port capacity controls, bridge audio recordings, radar tracks, ship's logs, weather and other ship movements at the time. It identifies several safety issues.;  Historic comparison  Nobby's Breakwater was originally built in the first half of the 19th century to protect ships entering Newcastle Harbour. After the breakwater was completed Nobby's Beach formed against it and over the reefs around Nobby's headland. It is on these reefs where Pasha Bulker came to grief. However, it is not the first ship to run aground in the area. In 1940 the TSS Maianbar, a 493-ton steamship, broke its towline while en route to Sydney and drifted ashore near where Pasha Bulker was beached. It could not be refloated and was dismantled on-site. Pasha Bulker beaching has also drawn parallels to the 1974 beaching of on Stockton beach, some further north, and Cherry Venture, which was beached during a storm in 1973 on Teewah Beach near Rainbow Beach in Queensland.

In 2019, The Professor, a novel on human rights was published by Gerak Budaya. It was translated by Brigitte Bresson.  Controversies   Shia  In 2008, Mufti of Perlis Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin whom often associated with Salafiism had written a letter to the chief editor of Harian Metro plus its copies to the Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) and the Home Affiars Ministry alleging Faisal of spreading the teachings of Shia Islam ‚Äìa very taboo topic on part of the Malaysian government‚Äì through one of the chapters published in the Ketupat Cinta series; which was further supported by JAKIM's Assistant Director for the Section of Aqidah, Mohd Aizam Mas‚Äôod. Apart from Mohd Asri, another Salafi figure who frequently accuses Faisal Tehrani as 'Shi'ite author' including Fathul Bari Mat Jahya. Due to the influence of Salafism takes place in Malaysia since the middle of 2000,http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/rise-of-salafism-in- malaysia-cause-of-controversial-fatwas-says-sociologist the allegations of the preachers have affected Faisal Tehrani's authority as a creative author. Faisal however denies such allegations and affirmed that he did not belong to this group, though he had stated his openness to the various schools of thought that have evolved in Islamic tradition; citing precedents like Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas and Burhanuddin al-Helmy with their efforts of reconciling syncretic Sunni and Shia traditions as a way of bridging understanding between both groups. Among the denials ever recorded is in his writing in Malaysiakini.http://theklreview.org/faisal-tehrani-bukan- sasterawan- masturbasi/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/05/07/author- says-novel-not-a-syiah-book/ However, Faisal's idea has not been accepted, and Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani, a lecturer at the School of International Studies, Universiti Utara Malaysia, said Faisal was one of the victims of the trend of the agenda of Islamic authorities to maintain its popularity. In 2011, Faisal Tehrani produced a novel titled Sebongkah Batu in Kuala Berang with PTS Litera. On 5‚Äì6 October 2011, at the 79th Islamic Content Publishing Materials Committee Meeting Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) meeting, the novel Sebongkah Batu was banned. No solid reason was given by the agency as a pretext for a ban. Sebongkah Batu in Kuala Berang however continues to be sold in the open market as JAKIM has no absolute power to prohibit books. In 2012, her work titled Perempuan Nan Bercinta published with the Malaysian Institute of Books (ITBM) once again raised furore. On December 3, 2013, Faisal Tehrani received a letter from the Publishing and Text Control Division of the Quran, the Home Ministry announced five of his works were banned by JAKIM. The works are Sebongkah Batu di Kuala Berang, Perempuan Nan Bercinta, drama Karbala, kumpulan puisi Ingin Jadi Nasrallah dan kumpulan cerpen Tiga Kali Seminggu. In an interview with Wall Street Journal Faisal explains that the novel's claim was banned by Shiite elements, \\"In this book, Ali Taqi questioned whether the possibility of a school of thought in Islam could be utilized to resolve the problem and the clutter of the Islamic version faced by the Sunni school of thought, which is merely a discourse, an academic discourse, so the Professor asked, Sunni and Shia are jointly put together to help resolve disputes, conflicts and crises? It is a complex novel There are various thought ideas in it\\".  Human Rights in Literature  In 2008, Professor Dr. Nor Faridah Abdul Manaf from International Islamic University called Faisal as a bold author and never failed to voice the truth to the authorities compared to other authors in Malay literature that often chose a safe path. It is mentioned in his paper 'Human Rights and National Literature: A Comparative Study of the Experiences in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines' published in Asiatic 2 (2): 74-84.http://journals.iium.edu.my/asiatic/index.php/AJELL/article/viewFile/49/35 According to Uthaya Sankar SB, the fact that authors in Malaysia are afraid of the authorities to curb them to produce literary works capable of receiving the attention of the Nobel Prize, is not seen in the work of Faisal Tehrani.http://www.beritadaily.com/news/2016-01-18/32047/address-issues-not- ban-books-says-uthaya Nowadays after various of controversies, Faisal is considered as the founder of the human rights movement in Malay literature. Among his works, which are evidently human rights include Homosektual short stories published in Mingguan Malaysia on June 24, 2012http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2012&dt;=0624&pub;=Utusan_Malaysia&sec;=Sastera&pg;=sa_01.htm and a short story translated by Yana Rizal for the Dialog Project site entitled A Muslim, A Lutheran published on October 19, 2015. In the year 2015, Faisal produced a children's book entitled 'Advencer Yaya and Fufu. Book 1: Jangan Cakap Begitu '. The Dubook Press publication briefly introduces Articles 1 and 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 with the target audience under the age of five.  Reprimand from the United Nations  On May 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Organization in a formal communication ‚ÄòCommunications report of Special Procedures: Communication Sent 1 March to 31 May 2014 Replies Received 1 May to 31 July 2014 Case Number MYS 4/2014‚Äô A/HRC/27/72, 2014' has sent a letter to the Malaysian government asking for clarification of why the novel Perempuan Nan Bercinta is prohibited, and stated that it is a violation of human rights. Dr Mohd Faizal Musa and Mr Maina Kiai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association. In relation to that, the four United Nations Special Rapporteur has reprimanded the Malaysian government in a special communications 'AL Cultural rights (2009) G/SO 214 (67-17) Assembly & Association (2010-1) G/SO 214 (56-23) MYS 4/2014' on May 27, 2014. They mentioned two novels: 'Perempuan Nan Bercinta' and 'Sebongkah Batu Berang '. The Special Rapporteur considers the banning of these books is an act of intimidating and humiliating Faisal Tehrani, a human rights activist, as well as academicians studying in the field. The Special Rapporteur is; Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. In the letter it is also possible for some other books to be prohibited.it. The Malaysian government ignored this reprimand, and even proceed with the banning of four Faisal Tehrani books effective April 1, 2015. 5.http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/banning-my-books-absurd- as-they-were-published-years-before-author-says Faisal Tehrani then challenged the banning of the four books on June 29, 2015 and requested a court review of the four books; Sebongkah Batu di Kuala Berang, Perempuan Nan Bercinta, Karbala drama, collection of Poetry, Ingin Jadi Nasrallah and a collection of short story of Tiga Kali Seminggugugu.http://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/12/118685/novelist-faisal- tehrani-seeks-overturn-book-ban  Liberal Islam  In addition to Shiite allegations, Faisal is also often mocked by a liberal title. Liberal Islam claims in Malaysia are often viewed negatively. Some of the accusations are Khalid Muammar A Harris who accuses Faisal of insulting Islamic institutions in this country and religious institutions. Faisal stressed that liberal lifestyles are not a negative, even claimed by the Rukun Negara, namely the national ideology of Malaysia; \\"The head of the Rukun Negara is often left behind by many people, so many are left behind or overlooked that Malaysia wants to\\" a liberal way of rich cultural tradition\\". Faisal also believes that the influence of 'Literal Islam' or Salafism has make it complicated for the atmosphere of plurality and multiracial in Malaysia. According to him, the situation in Malaysia is now rampant with teo-fascism and the hope to see Malaysia as a moderate Muslim country is straying away.  Death Threats  Since falling prey to Shia charges and the liberal Islamic agnets, Mohd Faizal Musa often gets death threats. He has also faced several death threats made against him, in which he documents them on his Twitter account.  Further Development  Following the ban on Women Nan Bercinta, Faisal Tehrani seems to be submerged from the mainstream of Malaysian literature. However, his writings and excerpts can still be traced through his column at Malaysiakini BM which often accepts warm comments from readers. In 2014, after publishing How Anyss Going Up to Heaven (Bagaimana Anyss Naik Ke Langit) with the DuBook Press, Faisal republished his short stories in two previous underground short stories with Thukul Cetak publishers. The short story is titled Cerpen2 Underground (2015) with the addition of about 20 miniature short stories. Faisal made a move to publish his first essay book entitled Aku______, Maka Aku Ada! (DuBook Press 2015). The book's cover presented him and his late Master Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, and on his back cover written; ‚ÄòUsah ajari aku bagaimana menjadi Muslim. Engkau tidak semua tahu. Dan aku tidak selalu jahil‚Äô. (Do not teach me how to become a Muslim. You all do not know. And I'm not always ignorant) On May 6, 2015, Faisal Tehrani was shocked when the Home Ministry decided to ban his four booksKarbala(2008), Ingin Jadi Nasrallah (2010), Tiga Kali Seminggu (2010) and Sebongkah Batu di Kuala Berang (2011). The ban comes into effect on April 1, 2015. Karbala, which was banned by the government, was the subject of study by Professor Dr Edwin Wierenga of the University of Cologne, Germany in his paper 'A Ta'ziya from 21st-century Malaysia: Faisal Tehrani's Passion Play Karbala'. It is included in the academic book titled 'Shi'ism in South East Asia' by Chiara Formichi's edits. This book is the publication of C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd and goes on sale in the open market beginning May 21, 2015. 'Karbala' was once created in the Literature Hall from Vol. 36, No. 12 (2006). The Karbala Drama is serialized between December 2006 and July 2007. Despite his pressure on Faisal, he published his second poem; The Mek Bah Bahia chapter published by Print (2015) and a children's book entitled ‚ÄòAdvencer Yaya dan Fufu. Buku 1: Jangan Cakap Begitu‚Äô. This book briefly introduces Articles 1 and 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 with the target audience below the age of five. Mohd Faizal also produced a film in 2015 titled Leukerbad, which captures the travel of human rights activists in Geneva, Switzerland. On January 10, 2018, the Court of Appeal quashed a Home's Ministry order banning four books authored by Faisal. A three-man panel comprising Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, Ahmadi Asnawi and Zaleha Yusof found that the order issued on Feb 12, 2015, was not in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. Justice Zaleha, said that the order of banning the books was a restrcition of Faisal's fundamental right of freedom of speech. Justice Zaleha also added, the books ‚Äì Sebongkah Batu di Kuala Berang (published by PTS Litera Utama Sdn Bhd); Karbala (published by Aberdeen Books World), Tiga Kali Seminggu and Ingin Jadi Nasrallah (both published by Al- Ameen Serve Holdings Sdn Bhd) ‚Äì were not a threat to national security and public order. The panels stated that they had read the books, and nothing comes to their attention and they could not apprehend how the four books could create public disorder or be a threat to the society. On June 27, 2018, Faisal was called up by Putrajaya's Council of Eminent Persons to present his input on the way forward for Islamic bodies in Malaysia. Faisal was among scholars and activists called by the council to get feedback on the reform of Islamic institutions. Faisal suggested to the council that the advisers for religious agencies should also be academics such as anthropologists and sociologists. Faisal proposed that the government set up an advisory council comprising experts in religious and non-religious sciences to advise Islamic agencies in the country. During and interview with Free Malaysia Today (FMT), on July 19, 2018, Faisal Tehrani warns of likely conservative backlash as the Pakatan Harapan triumph on the Malaysian 14th General Election, and the fall of Barisan Nasional government. Faisal Tehrani stated that 'he feels the fresh air of change' after the week Pakatan Harapan took over the administration. Faisal is optimistic about the serious changes that the 'new government' are bringing.

Cretici. f., Metellae, Crassi, \\"Caecilia, daughter of Quintus Creticus, of the Metellus family and of the Crassus family\\" Naming conventions for women in ancient Rome differed from nomenclature for men, and practice changed dramatically from the Early Republic to the High Empire and then into Late Antiquity. Females were identified officially by the feminine of the family name (nomen gentile, that is, the gens name), which might be further differentiated by the genitive form of the father's cognomen, or for a married woman her husband's. Numerical adjectives might distinguish among sisters, such as Tertia, \\"the Third\\" (compare Generational titles in English names). By the late Republic, women also often adopted the feminine of their father's cognomen. A woman kept her own family name after she married, though she might be identified in relation to her husband: the name Clodia Metelli, \\"Clodia [wife] of Metellus,\\" preserves the birth name Clodia and adds her husband's name to specify which Clodia. Children usually took the father's name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother's family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18. History Early to Middle Republic Women in the early to mid-Republic were usually known by their family name (nomen). A woman from the gens Aemilia would be called Aemilia; from the gens Cornelia, Cornelia; from the gens Sempronia, Sempronia; and so on. If there were many daughters, a cognomen such as Tertia (Third) could indicate birth order, for example, Aemilia Tertia, the wife of Scipio Africanus. (She, however, is better known as Aemilia Paulla.) The comparative adjectives Maior and Minor, meaning \\"the Elder\\" and \\"the Younger\\" when attached to a name, might distinguish between two sisters; for example, the daughters of Gaius Laelius Sapiens are known as Laelia Maior and Laelia Minor. Birth order is not the best or only predictor of a woman's perceived importance or prominence; Cornelia Africana most commonly refers to Cornelia Africana Minor, the younger daughter of Scipio Africanus, and not to her elder sister. Sons, by comparison, were distinguished by a praenomen, the first or personal name of a Roman male's typical three names (tria nomina). The eldest son was most often given the same praenomen as his father, with others given the name of a grandfather or uncle.Lawrence Keppie, Understanding Roman Inscriptions (Routledge, 1991), p. 19. This tradition casts doubt on the usage of numerical names: the masculine praenomina Quintus (\\"the Fifth\\"), Sextus (\\"the Sixth\\"), and Decimus (\\"the Tenth\\") were widely used without reference to birth order, because they were passed on. Thus the semi-legendary Claudia Quinta should have been the fifth daughter of her patrician father from the gens Claudia, but it is doubtful that four older sisters existed: Quinta is probably an archaic feminine praenomen that later Latin authors treated as a cognomen.T. P. Wiseman, Clio's Cosmetics (Bristol Phoenix Press, 2003, originally published 1979), p. 95. Late Republic By the Late Republic, a cognomen, the third of the tria nomina, becomes more important in distinguishing family branches of the main gens. The importance of the cognomen is reflected also in naming practice as it pertains to women, for example Cornelia Sulla, Pompeia Magna, Cornelia Metella. Licinia Crassa Maior and Licinia Crassa Minor were daughters of Lucius Licinius Crassus. High Empire In the era of Augustus and thereafter, Roman women used more varied first names and sometimes even two first names. Naming practice became less rigid, as is evidenced among women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. While Augustus's wives were known by their father's gens name (Clodia Pulchra, Scribonia, and Livia) and Tiberius's wives were known by their fathers' less-known gentilical names (Vipsania Agrippina and Julia the Elder), by the third generation of the Imperial family, naming patterns had changed. Julia's daughters by her second husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa were Julia the Younger and Agrippina the Elder, not Vipsania Tertia and Vipsania Quarta. Likewise, Agrippina the Elder's daughters were Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Livilla, and not named for their father's adoptive family, the gens Julia. Likewise, in the family of Octavia the Younger and Mark Antony, the naming patterns for their daughters (Antonia Major and Antonia Minor) and Octavia's by her first husband (Claudia Marcella Major and Claudia Marcella Minor) are conventional, but that for their granddaughter Livilla (daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus) is not. In later generations, two names were adopted by females. This meant that Claudius's daughters were not Claudia Major and Claudia Minor, but Claudia Antonia by his marriage to Aelia Paetina and Claudia Octavia by his marriage to Messalina. Among the elite, names such as Pomponia Graecina became common. In still later generations, women's names bore little or no resemblance to their father's family names. For example, in the Flavian dynasty, Titus's daughter was not Flavia. In the Severan dynasty, most women bore the first name of Julia, even if it was not the family's gentilical name, but the second name was different and hence was used to distinguish them. In the Theodosian dynasty, the daughter of Theodosius I was not Theodosia but Galla Placidia, and named partly for her mother. * A woman could be named for a grandparent. For example, Livilla, sister of Germanicus and Claudius, was named for her paternal grandmother Livia. * A combination of her family name and the name of a mother or grandmother. Claudius's first wife Plautia Urgulanilla was named for her father's family, Plautii, and her paternal grandmother Urgulania, a close friend of Claudius's own paternal grandmother Livia. * A woman could also be named for her father's family and a place of origin (somewhat like men, but without a unique praenomen). * A woman could be named after other relatives. This naming convention applied to Caligula's three sisters. The middle of the three sisters, Julia Drusilla, was named for her paternal grandfather Nero Claudius Drusus, itself a cognomen. The youngest of the three sisters, Julia Livilla, was named for her paternal aunt, Livilla. The eldest of the three sisters, Agrippina the Younger, was named after her mother. Likewise, Julia the Younger, Agrippina's maternal aunt, was also named after her mother. Some empresses were given the praenomen Julia even if they are unrelated to the gens Julia.The Dictionary Of Roman Coins Some, like Livia and Agrippina the Younger, were awarded the agnomen of Augusta (\\"Majestic\\"), a parallel of their husbands' (Augustus). Late antiquity In Late Antiquity, women were frequently named for their mothers or other female relatives, who in turn were often named for female (or sometimes male) Christian saints. Thus the Empress Galla Placidia's name shows only her mother's name, not her father's. Other examples: Arria was a daughter of Thrasea Paetus and his wife Arria;Tacitus, Ann. 16, 34Pliny the Younger, Ep.. 3, 6, 10; 7, 19, 3 and possibly Considia, daughter of Servilius Nonianus.Pliny the Elder, NH 24, 43Syme; 1964a:412f Empresses bearing pagan names‚Äîe.g. Aelia Eudocia, formerly Athena√Øs‚Äîwere renamed to have more Christian names, sometimes for an earlier empress. A few empresses such as Theodora, wife of Justinian, were also allegedly renamed. Late Byzantine empresses bore names derived via Latin from Greek: * Anna (meaning \\"grace/charm\\" or \\"mercy\\") * Agnes (\\"chaste\\" or \\"sacred\\"), a name of one of the earliest Christian saints, Agnes of Rome * Irene (\\"peace\\"), * Eudoxia (\\"good fame\\") * Euphrosyne (\\"joy\\") * Theodora (\\"god's gift\\") * Zoe (\\"life\\") Most of these names showed Greek influences, while a few were the names of Christian female saints. Suffixes Many times women needed unofficial names to differenciate them between their relatives, this was often done with the help of suffixes, for example the diminutive suffix illa/ila (alternatively ulla/ula or olla/ola) meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" was used often, for example: Julilla for a young Julia, Drusilla for a young Drusa. The suffix dervived from the word ulla which was the word for a little pit and could be used to denote that the woman in question was a younger relative of someone with the same name, that she was still a little girl, or simply implying affection, for example Cicero's daughter Tullia was called by him \\"Tulliola\\" even as an adult despite not having any older sisters or other notable female relatives. The suffix was not always added to the end of the nomen or cognomen, but sometimes also to a woman's numeral, for example, Brutus' sister Junia Tertia was nicknamed Tertulla. Another suffix used was ina/inna which would imply relative of, for example \\"Agrippina was the daughter of Agrippa\\" or \\"Messalina was the daughter of Messala\\". The most common forms for all the female numerals were Primula, Secundina, Tertiola/Tertulla, Quartilla and Quintilla/Quintina.

He was an all-rounder and a good slip fielder, whose long first-class career with Surrey linked the days of Jack Hobbs with those of Peter May. A tall man, he might have achieved even more than he did but for back trouble. Even so, he was an essential member of the Surrey side for many years. As a batsman, he preferred to attack, and was an especially fine driver of the ball. He was often at his best in a crisis. He reached a thousand runs in a season nine times in succession (1938‚Äì1939 and 1946‚Äì1952 ‚Äì this excludes 1945, in which season he played in only one match). His medium-paced bowling was generally steady rather than particularly penetrative. He took 50 or more wickets in a season 5 times, but never managed more than 67. He never played Test cricket, although he was picked as a member of the party to India in 1939‚Äì40, for a tour which never took place because of the outbreak of World War II. The War also deprived him of six of what, judging by his age, might have been expected to be amongst his best seasons. Most of his best years were after the war, for it was not until 1937 that he became a really valuable member of the side. He had his best season with the ball, in terms of his average, in 1946, taking 56 wickets at only 15.58 each. He made his highest score of 255 in 1949 against the touring New Zealanders, the innings taking only six and a half hours. That season was his best with the bat, both in terms of aggregate (1789) and average (40.65). He finished on a high note, retiring after the 1952 season in which Surrey won the County Championship outright for the first time since 1914, having shared the title in 1950.

The group was founded in 1985 by Wolfgang Wendland (vocals), Nikolai Sonnenschei√üe (guitar), Volker Kampfgarten (drums, jazz guitar) and Mitch Maestro (bass guitar). The lyrics of Die Kassierer's songs are mainly about drugs, sex, violence, strange phenomena - such as aliens - and the region the band comes from. Generally their lyrics are extremely satirical and therefore often misunderstood. Die Kassierer have been criticized for making what has been considered aggressive and socially as well as sexually disorienting music, but up to now only the album Habe Brille (I got glasses) has been officially indexed as harmful by the \\"Bundespr√ºfstelle f√ºr jugendgef√§hrdende Medien\\" (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons). This indexing was due to the original album's pornografic cover. Shortly after the indexing the cover was changed, so that the LP was acceptable for sale in Germany again. Further attempts to label other LPs of Die Kassierer have been blocked by the courts because their songs were deemed satirical and socially critical enough to qualify as art. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the band in 2005 nineteen artists, including the Donots, Die Lokalmatadore, Hennes Bender, Emscherkurve 77 and Mambo Kurt recorded songs of Die Kassierer for a tribute album, also called \\"Kunst\\".

This was erected by the Royal Engineers over the top of the old bridge, part of which was removed to allow a support to be built on the Staffordshire bank of the river, the temporary bridge had to be built due to flood damage to the old bridge after the severe winter of 1947. This bridge had to again be replaced in 1974 by a more modern version of the temporary bridge. The old bridge was a toll bridge for many years and pictures of the \\"old bridge\\" and the toll house are still available.

The railway station was situated in a historical building, constructed between 1844 and 1847 by Rosenbaum, which lies parallel to the tracks. The design was chosen to allow for future line expansion. The station was initially a terminus of the Krak√≥wUpper Silesia Railway (Kolej Krakowsko-G√≥rno≈õlƒÖska, ). Trains entered the trainshed via a brick archway at the northern end of the station which was almost doubled in size in 1871. In 2014, a new building was opened. History and early connections The station opened on 13 October 1847, with the first train leaving for Mys≈Çowice (the point where the Austrian, German and Russian Empires adjoined during military partitions of Poland). The railway line was extended eastwards in 1856, when the first section to Dƒôbica (then Dembitz in the Habsburg Empire) was built by the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis connecting Krak√≥w with Lw√≥w (then Lemberg) in Galicia. The increasing traffic resulted in the station's modernization and enlargement in several stages between 1869 and 1894. The next substantial expansion took place in the 1930s in the reborn Polish Republic. At that time the northern brick wall and trainshed were demolished, the latter replaced by individual platform roofs. Underground expansion and revitalisation A new urban shopping mall, Galeria Krakowska (Krak√≥w Mall), opened in September 2006 with adjacent parking for 1,400 cars. The construction of the Galeria Krakowska and remodelling of the area in front of the main station building means that taxis are no longer able to drive up to the station or collect passengers directly from the main entrance; however, the free overhead parking and passenger pick- up right above the tracks is now closer to the platforms, accessible via a convenient elevator. The station has undergone a multimillion z≈Çoty refurbishment to improve passengers' experience. A new transport interchange has been developed. This includes a bus station to the east, and an express tram line under the station which opened in December 2008. A new underground ticket hall opened in February 2014, with waiting rooms, travel centres and other amenities. This is located to the north of the earlier platform underpass, and connected to the platforms by escalators. It also provides two new direct exits/entrances to the station complex, one from the lower level of Galeria Krakowska and another from the Regional Bus Station located to the east of the railway station. The current platform underpass will also be refurbished.History and modernisation of Krak√≥w G≈Ç√≥wny, at PKP S.A. Robi siƒô. Accessed July 23, 2011.

Licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. History Brasero was developed by Philippe Rouquier & Luis Medinas. The project was originally named Bonfire, but was renamed after the Spanish word brasero for a small heater used to provide warmth for people sitting at a table. Early releases of the application were well received. In a review in April 2007 published in Free Software Magazine Robin Monks concluded: After further development and the inclusion of Brasero 0.7.1 in Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron in April 2008 the application received further press reviews. In May 2008 Ryan Paul of Ars Technica said: Brasero was later integrated into GNOME and the version numbers were aligned with GNOME desktop version numbering. Ars Technica reviewed Brasero 2.26, then the newest version, in March 2009, saying: Brasero was at one time the default CD/DVD application in the GNOME desktop, but with more modern computer hardware omitting optical drives, it was removed from the GNOME core feature set with version 3.8 in 2013. Features Data Brasero supports both CD and DVD formats. It allows for editing of the disc contents and can remove, move and rename files that are located inside folders. It can also burn data to CD/DVDs on the fly. The application allows automatic filtering for unwanted files, including hidden files, broken and recursive symlinks and files not conforming to the Joliet CD standard. Brasero supports multisessions, the Joliet extension and can create an image of the user's hard drive. Audio When creating audio CDs Brasero writes CD-TEXT information automatically found, using GStreamer. It also supports the editing of CD-TEXT information and can burn audio CDs on the fly. It can use all audio file formats handled by GStreamer local installation, including Ogg, FLAC and MP3. Brasero can also search for audio files that are inside dropped folders. Copying Brasero is capable of copying a CD/DVD to the user's hard drive in iso format and can copy DVDs and CDs on the fly. It supports single-session data DVDs and any type of CD.

The group consisted of about 200 young men dressed in leather jackets, acting as the personal paramilitary and bodyguard of Tibor Szamuely, Commissar for Military Affairs. Their unit commander was J√≥zsef Cserny. The Lenin Boys were used as an instrument to violently suppress counter-revolutionary movements against the communist government. After a failed counter-revolutionary coup attempt in June 1919, Communist leader B√©la Kun is said to have unleashed the Lenin Youth in a more savage fashion, in order to stamp out any more counter-revolutionary urges among his opponents. Tallies of the number of victims of the terror vary; different sources generally count the dead at close to 600. A book published by Dr. Albert V√°ry in 1922, titled \\"The Victims of Red Terror in Hungary\\" documents 590 suspects executed by the communist police. After Hungarian-Romanian war, Romanian troops entered Hungary and took Budapest from the Hungarians on August 6, 1919. Kun and his Party of Communists colleagues fled. After the arrival of Mikl√≥s Horthy's counterrevolutionary Hungarian paramilitaries in Budapest three months later, stalwartly anti-Communist officers carried out a wave of retributive violence against Communists and their supporters (as well as suspected leftists of any stripe) known as the White Terror. As many communist leaders were ethnically Jewish, this encouraged anti-semitic lynchings in Budapest by these paramilitary forces. The Lenin Youth were also particular targets by the counter-revolutionary forces. Cserny was captured, tried and executed by the new regime in December 1919, along with several other Lenin boys.\\"Execute Joseph Cserny And 13 Other Reds; Commander of 'Lenin Boys' Pays Penalty of His Crimes at Budapest\\", The New York Times, December 23, 1919 See also *Red Terror (Hungary)  Sources  * Borsanyi, Gyorgy.

It was opened in 1906 by Argyll Motors Ltd, at the time the largest producer of cars in Scotland. After the Argyll company folded it was used as a torpedo factory, subsequently lying empty for many years, and is now a shopping centre. The elaborate structure is protected as a category A listed building. History Argyll Motors Ltd was established in Bridgeton, Glasgow, in 1899 as the Hozier Engineering Company. By 1905, the company was expanding production rapidly, and a new site at Alexandria, outside the city, was identified. Plans were drawn up by architect Charles James Halley, and the building was officially opened by John Douglas-Scott- Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, on 26 June 1906. The factory covered , and was served by its own railway line and several streets of houses for the factory workers. The new facility cost over ¬£200,000, and was designed to produce 2,500 cars per year. By 1907, production had passed 800 per year, but a series of technical experiments, and increasing competition, led to the company's decline. The high running costs of the huge factory, and the failure to adopt mass production, may also have contributed to the company's troubles. The final blow came in 1914 following a lawsuit brought by Daimler, which Argyll won, but the costs led to bankruptcy and production ceased. The works, and its employees, were taken over by the Admiralty as a munitions factory during the First World War (1914‚Äì1919). Afterwards, it was briefly a silk works, but remained empty for most of the interwar period. In 1937, it was repurchased by the Admiralty and reopened as the Royal Naval Torpedo Factory, which operated into the 1950s. In the 1960s, the site is said to have been involved in Chevaline, a secret project to improve Britain's Polaris nuclear warheads. The facility was closed in 1969, and in 1971, the Argyll Works was purchased by electronics company Plessey. However, their production unit closed within a year, prompting a sit-in protest by staff. Despite various proposals, the factory remained empty for nearly three decades; the factory sheds were demolished, and the substantial red sandstone offices facing North Main Street deteriorated. The future of the building was secured in the 1990s with its renovation as a shopping centre, opened in 1997 by Princess Anne as Loch Lomond Factory Outlets. It now trades as Lomond Galleries.

Life and scientific work Ko≈Ços was born on September 6, 1928 in Pinsk. He received his M.Sc. in chemistry in 1950 and began his academic career as an organic chemist. However, he was soon attracted to theoretical physics. He began his graduate studies in theoretical physics in 1951 and completed his thesis in only two years. The University of Warsaw and the Polish Chemical Society award the Ko≈Ços Medal every two years to commemorate his life and career. Ko≈Ços is best known for his work on the theory of electron correlation in molecules. In 1958 he went the University of Chicago, at a time when powerful computers were first becoming available for scientific work. He developed a new computer program to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen molecule to unprecedented accuracy. In the early 1960s, Ko≈Ços and Wolniewicz published a number of pioneering papers on the potential energy curves of the hydrogen molecule, including several corrections to the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation, including adiabatic, non-adiabatic, and relativistic terms. One result attracted particular attention: the calculated dissociation energy disagreed with the best experimental data then available, from Gerhard Herzberg‚Äôs group. A few years later Herzberg improved his experiment and obtained a new result that agreed with the theoretical prediction. This was the first time that quantum mechanical calculations on a molecule had proved more accurate than the best experiments. Herzberg himself emphasized the importance of this in his Nobel Prize lecture. Ko≈Ços established a strong research group in molecular quantum chemistry in Warsaw, and made many other important contributions, particularly in the field of intermolecular forces. He made important contributions to the development of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory of intermolecular forces and carried out pioneering studies on the nonadditivity of intermolecular forces.

It was erected between 1605 and 1614 by the architect for Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg, Prince Bishop of Mainz. Until 1803, it was the second residence of the Prince Bishop of Mainz. It is constructed of red sandstone, the typical building material of the Spessart, the hills near Aschaffenburg. Location Schloss Johannisburg is located in the city of Aschaffenburg, in the district of Lower Franconia of the state of Bavaria, Germany. It is situated in the center of the city, overlooking the river Main. History The palace was erected between 1605 and 1614 by the architect for Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg, Archbishop of Mainz. The considerable expense came from the taxes of his fief: Eichsfeld, Erfurt and the Mainzer Oberstift (the part of the Electorate administered from Aschaffenburg) made the largest financial contributions. A keep from the destroyed 14th-century castle that had formerly stood on the site was included in the construction and is the oldest part of the castle. The prior castle had been burned down along with most of the town on 10 August 1552 by the troops of Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Until the end of the ecclesial principalities in Germany in 1803, Schloss Johannisburgwas the second residence of the Prince Bishop of Mainz, the first residence being the Electoral Palace in Mainz. At the end of the 18th century, the interior had been restructured in the style of Classicism (or Neoclassicism) by . Karl Theodor von Dahlberg, Archbishop of Mainz in 1803, retained the territory of Aschaffenburg ‚Äî turned into the newly created Principality of Aschaffenburg ‚Äî and was awarded other territories in compensation for territories west of the Rhine, including Mainz, which were annexed by France. From 1810-3, Aschaffenburg was part of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. Aschaffenburg and Schloss Johannisburg then passed to the Kingdom of Bavaria. During the reign of Ludwig I, Schloss Johannisburg served as the summer residence of the King, who referred to Aschaffenburg as his \\"Bavarian Nice\\". He commissioned the construction of a Roman villa known as Pompejanum within sight of the palace. The palace was nearly destroyed by US artillery in the closing days of World War II. Rebuilding started in 1951 and took more than twenty years. Description Schloss Johannisburg is one of the few mostly symmetrical palace buildings of the German Renaissance. The castle sits on a terrace overlooking the river, which Ridinger expanded in area and height, elevating the castle above even the highest flood lines. Four wings surround an almost square interior court. The buildings have three floors each with the exterior structured only by fascia and a central three-tiered transverse gable in each roof. A tower is located on each the four corners, extending outward beyond the building line. From a square foundation the towers turn octagonal from the seventh floor upwards. The towers are topped by slate roofs with roof lanterns. The symmetry of the structure is only broken by the old keep which extends into the courtyard from the north wing. It is crowned by a steep roof with four small decorative towerlets at the corners. This roof design was in contrast to Ridinger's plans, who had intended the central keep to mirror the appearance of the castle's corner towers. Chapel with rib vault inspired by Gothic architecture Small round stairway towers are located in the four corners of the court. The Schlosskirche or chapel is in the north wing. It extends through the ground and upper floor, with a rib vault referencing Gothic style. The chapel's altar, made from alabaster and marble, is by . It features a statue of Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg, holding a model of the castle. The castle is built from Buntsandstein, notably from the quarries of Obernburg and Miltenberg. Although the exterior walls are largely devoid of ornamentation, numerous artistic carvings were added to the gables and the gateways. Today The castle is one of the main attractions of Aschaffenburg and its landmark. Schloss Johannisburg is one of the most important buildings of the Renaissance period in Germany. Schloss Johannisburg is open to the public and hosts several museums: Staatsgalerie Aschaffenburg, a gallery of paintings (with works by Lucas Cranach the Elder), the Paramentenkammer of the palace chapel (with vestments from the former treasury of Mainz Cathedral), the residential rooms (furnished in Neoclassical style) and the Municipal Palace Museum (arts and handicraft). There is also the world's largest collection of architectural models made from cork, built by court confectioner Carl May and his son after 1792.

It shares similarities with Austrian, German, Polish, Hungarian and Ukrainian culture.EUROPA - Culture - Slovakia Wooden folk architecture can be seen in the well preserved village of Vlkol√≠nec, a UNESCO World Heritage Site  Folk tradition  Slovaks wearing folk costumes from Eastern Slovakia Folk tradition has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, \\"Nad Tatrou sa bl√Ωska\\", which is based on a melody from \\"Kopala studienku\\" folk song. Manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the \\"V√Ωchodn√°\\" Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation, which takes place in V√Ωchodn√° annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SƒΩUK (Slovensk√Ω ƒæudov√Ω umeleck√Ω kolekt√≠v‚ÄîSlovak folk art collective). SƒΩUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition. An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well preserved village of Vlkol√≠nec which has been the UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. The Pre≈°ov Region preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches. Most of them are protected by Slovak law as cultural heritage, but some of them are on the UNESCO list too, in Bodru≈æal, Hervartov, Ladomirov√° and Rusk√° Bystr√°. The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk mythologies, is Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k (1688‚Äì1713) (the Slovak equivalent of Robin Hood). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. J√°no≈°√≠k's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a film J√°no≈°√≠k directed by Martin Friƒç in 1935.  Art  Main altar in Basilica of St. James from the workshop of Master Paul of Levoƒça, highest wooden altar in the world, 1517 Visual art in Slovakia is represented through painting, drawing, printmaking, illustration, arts and crafts, sculpture, photography or conceptual art. The Slovak National Gallery founded in 1948, is the biggest network of galleries in Slovakia. Two displays in Bratislava are situated in Esterh√°zy Palace (Esterh√°zyho pal√°c) and the Water Barracks (Vodn√© kas√°rne), adjacent one to another. They are located on the Danube riverfront in the Old Town. The Bratislava City Gallery, founded in 1961 is the second biggest Slovak gallery of its kind. It stores about 35,000 pieces of Slovak and international art and offers permanent displays in P√°lffy Palace and Mirbach Palace, located in the Old Town. Danubiana Art Museum, one of the youngest art museums in Europe, is situated near ƒåunovo waterworks (part of Gabƒç√≠kovo Waterworks). Other major galleries include: Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art (Warhol's parents were from Mikov√°), East Slovak Gallery, Ernest Zmet√°k Art Gallery, Zvolen Castle.  Architecture  The buildings were constructed from various building materials with characteristic architecture. In the more mountainous parts of Slovakia it was often wood. The roofs were covered with wooden shingles and ornate gables. For the construction of simpler dwellings was also used clay with straw. Such buildings were typical especially for the southern parts of Slovakia, Z√°horie and Pova≈æie. Earthen buildings were built by \\"charging\\" technology, when the induced clay was compressed, charged perpendicularly between the slab formwork, creating both the peripheral and transverse walls of the house.BE≈áADIKOV√Å, J. a KOL.. Estetick√° v√Ωchova. 1. vyd. [s.l.] : SPN, 1992. S. 160. The typical architecture of individual regions is preserved by the folk architecture conservation reserves. The most famous are Velk√© Lev√°re, Brhlovce, Sebechleby, ƒåiƒçmany, ≈†pania Dolina, Vlkol√≠nec, Podbiel and ≈Ωdiar. There are currently 10 open-air museums in Slovakia. They are located in various parts of the country: Museum of the Slovak Village in Martin on Turci, Vychylovka in Kysuce, Zuberec in Orava, Pribylina in Liptov, Svidn√≠k in Saris, Humenne in Zemplin, Nitra in the Danube region, etc.TOLM√ÅƒåI, L. a KOL..

There are also many castles, chateaus, churches, manor houses and other cultural monuments in Slovakia. According to some sources, Slovakia has the highest concentration of castles per capita. A more durable stone was used in their construction. Interesting are also urban monument reserves, which are in most of historical cities: Bratislava, Banska Stiavnica, Kosice, Bardejov, Levoca, Banska Bystrica and others. An integral part of Slovak architecture are wooden churches, which have been built on the local territory since the second half of the 15th century. At present, there are around 40 wooden churches in Slovakia. Not all of them are accessible and some of them are part of open-air museums.  Literature  ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, the author of the Slovak language standard For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see List of Slovak authors. Christian topics include: poem Proglas as a foreword to the four Gospels, partial translations of the Bible into Old Church Slavonic, Zakon sudnyj ljudem. Medieval literature, in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in Latin, Czech and Slovakised Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include Johannes de Thurocz, author of the Chronica Hungarorum and Maurus, both of them Hungarians. The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period. There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was Anton Bernol√°k whose concept was based on the western Slovak dialect in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843. Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include Pavol Jozef ≈†af√°rik, Matej Bel, J√°n Koll√°r, and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik and Alexander Dubƒçek.  Cuisine  Halu≈°ky with bryndza cheese, kapustnica soup and Zlat√Ω Ba≈æant dark beer‚Äîexamples of Slovak cuisine Traditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on pork, poultry (chicken is the most widely eaten, followed by duck, goose, and turkey), flour, potatoes, cabbage, and milk products. It is relatively closely related to Hungarian, Czech and Austrian cuisine. On the east it is also influenced by Ukrainian and Polish cuisine. In comparison with other European countries, \\"game meat\\" is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular. Boar, rabbit, and venison are generally available throughout the year. Lamb and goat are eaten but are not widely popular. The traditional Slovak meals are bryndzov√© halu≈°ky, bryndzov√© pirohy and other meals with potato dough and bryndza. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov√© halu≈°ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant. A typical soup is a sauerkraut soup (\\"kapustnica\\"). A blood sausage called \\"krvavnica\\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal. Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. Slovak wine comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros√© (except in some regions), and sweet wine more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing. Beer (mainly of the pilsener style, though dark lagers are also consumed) is also popular.  Sport  Sporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. Ice hockey and football have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though tennis, handball, basketball, volleyball, whitewater slalom, cycling and athletics are also popular. ;Ice Hockey Slovak national ice hockey team celebrating a victory against Sweden at the 2010 Winter Olympics One of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is ice hockey. Slovakia became a member of the IIHF on 2 February 1993 and since then has won 4 medals in Ice Hockey World Championships, consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze. The most recent success was a silver medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship in Helsinki. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the IIHF World Ranking at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team HC Slovan Bratislava participated in the Kontinental Hockey League, considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world. Slovakia hosted the 2011 IIHF World Championship, where Finland won the gold medal and 2019 IIHF World Championship, where Finland also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in Bratislava and Ko≈°ice. ;Football Football stadium Teheln√© pole in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the Slovak national football team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup once, in 2010. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the Netherlands. The most notable result was the 3‚Äì2 victory over Italy. In 2016, the Slovak national football team qualified for the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, under head coach J√°n Koz√°k. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the FIFA World Rankings. In club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the UEFA Champions League Group Stage, namely MFK Ko≈°ice in 1997‚Äì98, FC Artmedia Bratislava in 2005‚Äì06 season, and M≈†K ≈Ωilina in 2010‚Äì11. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the UEFA Cup, therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.

The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (known as BIOS) is an independent, non-profit marine science and education institute located in Ferry Reach, St. George's, Bermuda. The Institute, founded in 1903 as the Bermuda Biological Station, hosts a full-time faculty of oceanographers, biologists, and environmental scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 groups, and Road Scholar (formerly Elderhostel) groups. BIOS's strategic mid-Atlantic Ocean location has at its doorstep a diverse marine environment, with close proximity to deep ocean as well as coral reef and near shore habitats. Prior to 5 September 2006, BIOS was known as the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR). History Founded in 1903 and incorporated in New York as a US not-for-profit institution in 1926, in its initial years BIOS was a seasonal field station for visiting zoologists and biologists to take advantage of Bermuda's diverse marine environment. After the Second World War, BIOS became a year-round research center, anchored by the establishment in 1954 of Hydrostation 'S': regular deep ocean observations of a single point in the ocean that continue today, creating the longest continuous oceanic database in the world. During the following few decades, increasing numbers of visiting scientists brought an increased emphasis on biological and geological studies. Resident scientific programs strengthened in the 1980s as the institute became a key link in an international effort to describe and understand the ocean-atmosphere system. In 1998, BIOS established the International Center for Ocean and Human Health, considered the first of its kind to explore the ocean health/human health connection on a global scale. The Center for Integrated Ocean Observations was established in 1999 and uses new technologies to build on a century of marine research at the institute. Other notable dates: 1978: Oceanic Flux Program begins, the longest record of deep ocean sediment-trap studies in the world. 1988: Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) begins, establishing BIOS as one of two US centers for time-series studies on temporal variability in the ocean and providing key data on changing climate and the ocean. 1994: Risk Prediction Initiative, a collaboration between climate scientists and reinsurers, is established. Notable visitors Summers from 1928 to 1939, oceanographic explorer William Beebe worked in Bermuda. During those years, Beebe visited BIOS (then the Bermuda Biological Station for Research) and worked with BIOS staff. While Beebe is best remembered for his Bathysphere dives at Nonsuch Island, he made a number of other significant scientific contributions during his stay, mainly the discovery of new species of marine life. Research programs BIOS has a range of research programs investigating the role of the ocean in global climate, the health of coral reefs, and the connection between healthy oceans and healthy people. The geographical range is not restricted to the waters around Bermuda, but also extends to the Arctic, the Antarctic and the tropics. The Center for Integrated Ocean Observations program is an international collaboration of oceanographers and climate scientists. Taking advantage of Bermuda's unique position, their goal is to better understand the biological, chemical and physical processes that take place in the ocean and the ocean's role in regulating the Earth's climate. The International Center for Ocean and Human Health is designed to address both health of the ocean (such as pollution threats) and health from the ocean (including nutrients and pharmaceutical applications). Working with experts on ocean acidification, coral reefs, ecotoxicology, algal biofuel, and the carbon cycle. The Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI) program brings climate scientists and insurers together to collaborate to identify new directions for climate research. Matching the Institute's unique research ability with Bermuda's insurance market, this business-science partnership provides rapid, current and comprehensive information to those parts of the business community affected by environmental change. Research vessel Preparing the CTD for deployment from the R/V Atlantic ExplorerThe R/V Atlantic Explorer is a research vessel owned and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and is supported by the National Science Foundation and BIOS. It operates in compliance with United States Coast Guard, University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) rules and regulations. The 168 ft Atlantic Explorer is equipped with navigation, laboratory and mechanical systems and equipment to support biological, geological, chemical and physical oceanographic research. Deploying and recovering deep ocean instrumentation moorings, conducting CTD casts, chemical sampling, and gear testing are among the number of operations within the ship's capabilities. Ready access of two hours or more from Bermuda to the deep ocean makes the Atlantic Explorer useful for both short and extended cruises, for repetitive sampling and time- series research, and for projects requiring analytical and other sophisticated shore facilities.

Its beginning was marked by the reconvening of the Diet of Hungary of 1825 and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The era ended with the 1848 revolution and the ensuing Hungarian War of Independence.  Antecedents and main issues  Francis I was a conservative absolutist monarch. He reigned by intimidation and he had an informer network too. At that time, Hungary was really far behind the Czech and Austrian provinces in development: the country relied on the agricultural production (therefore the industry wasn‚Äôt really developed) and the guild system, which strict regulations prevented the development of the industry and the trade. The revolutionary wave which swept through Europe brought two new ideas to Hungary too: nationalism and liberalism. But what did they want? They wanted to convert the old and outdated feudal economy and society to a new and modern one. The solution was brought by the deepening crisis of the feudal system, in which the nobility had to make some changes in their situation, therefore they saw the way out of this crisis with the introduction of embourgeoisement. In Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi‚Äôs work, Credit, he raises the idea of the abolition of antiquity and the elimination of robotic systems, because he realized that the agriculture wouldn‚Äôt develop and the land sales wouldn‚Äôt grow, if they keep these restrictions, because the people can‚Äôt get credit to their lands (the book received its name from that).  The Reform Diets  1825‚Äì27 After many years, a Diet was convened in Bratislava in 1825. The reason why it was convened is that there were some international problems in 1820. The king, Francis I promised to return to the feudal constitution, but in exchange the nobility had to increase the tax and rookie headcount. This diet weren‚Äôt a Reform Diet, but this was the first one in which some progress were made: they had to convene the parliament/diet every 3 years and Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi offered his annual income to establish a Hungarian Academy of Sciences. 1832‚Äì36 Antecedents: cholera outbreak in 1831->serf uprising in Upper Hungary The diet‚Äôs lower house accepted the serfs voluntary redemption (the serfs had to pay to their landlords after their services, so they could be free) but the monarch rejected that Also: new monarch: Ferdinand I of Austria (1835‚Äì48) 1839‚Äì40 The introduction of the voluntary redemption (no results, the serf‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have enough money, only 1% of the serfs could free themselves) Jewish emancipation (free establishment/settlement in the cities, they could join the trade and businesses, the immigration of the Jews began) 1843‚Äì44 Hungarian became the official language Protectionist tariffs-> V√©degylet is established (Hungarians will only buy items from Hungary for 6 years) 1847‚Äì48 (the last Estates General) Kossuth became the emissary of Pest Adoption of the April Laws in March 1848 (sanctioned by the King on 11 April 1848): introduction of a new form of government (constitutional monarchy, accountable government, suffrage); declaration of civil liberties; abolition of the old, feudal social and legal system.  Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi vs Lajos Kossuth   Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi  -conservative -aristocrat from Wien -slow modernisation with the leading role of the aristocrats and maintaining the good relations with the Habsburgs -no political reforms -no independent Hungarian industry -only the agriculture, trade and society should be modernized -free trade (the abolition of internal tariffs, guilds and monopolies) Really important figure because he brought modern technology to Hungary such as steamboats (Lake Balaton, Danube), locomotives, horse- breeding, steam mills, Chain Bridge, casinos, river channeling, etc.  Lajos Kossuth  -main supporters: lesser nobility and bourgeoisie of the cities -fast and radical reforms (even with revolution) -liberal -modernization through rapid industrialization and urbanization -freedom of serfs (mandatory redemption with state compensation) -constitutional monarchy  April Laws  References Category:19th century in Hungary Category:1820s in Hungary Category:1830s in Hungary Category:1840s in Hungary ","title":"Hungarian Reform Era"},{"id":"11661945","title":"Henrie Mutuku"},{"id":"11661946","text":"Upekha Ashantha Fernando (born December 17, 1979 in Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan first-class cricketer who played for the Sinhalese Sports Club from 1997-98 to 2002-03.

This is the reason why, under the leadership of Devardhigani Ksamasramana, the eleven Angas of the Svetambara canon were formalised and reduced to writing. This took place at Valabhi 993 years after MƒÅhavƒ´ra's nirvana. (466 CE). In the vacana held at Valabhi, in Gujarat, the Sthananga Sutra was finalised and redacted. The language used is ArdhamƒÅgadhƒ´ Prakrit. The mula sutras of the Sthananga Sutra are difficult to understand without the help of a commentary or tika. Hence, in the 11th century CE, Abhayadevasuri wrote a comprehensive Sanskrit gloss on the Sthananga Sutra. Description The SthƒÅnƒÅngas≈´tra is known in Prakrit as the Thanam. The word thanam denotes quantum. Hence, the style of the Sthananga Sutra is unique. It is divided into ten chapters, and each chapter enumerates certain topics according to their numbers. Each chapter is titled as a Thana. (Sanskrit: SthƒÅnƒÅ) This ƒÅgama defines and catalogues the main substances of the Jain metaphysics. Diverse topics such as the Dharmakathanuyoga, Carananuyoga, Karananuyoga and Dravyanuyoga are covered. While the focus is on Karananuyoga, this unique ƒÅgama serves as a huge anthology to all branches of Jaina knowledge. Because all topics, terms and things are thought of as fitting well with number one, number two, and so on, up to number ten, and because they are listed accordingly, the word \\"sthƒÅna\\" in the titles of the ten chapters as well as in the title of our work means \\"place\\". The SthƒÅnƒÅngas≈´tra is an anga- text in which \\"terms and things\\" are listed in their \\"right place\\". SthƒÅnƒÅnga maybe considered as a memory aid for an ƒÅcƒÅrya, so that he might not forget the varied subject matters he wants to teach. With this work he has a kind of guideline for his lessons at hand and can easily reply to questions asked by his disciples. Importance of SthƒÅnƒÅngas≈´tra can be gauged from the fact that VyavahƒÅra Chedas≈´tra (10, 20-34) mentions that it is suitable to be studied only by those ascetics, who have at least eight years standing in monkhood. Further more it is stated that only a monk who knows the SthƒÅnƒÅnga by heart may attain the position of an ƒÅcƒÅrya, which, entitles him to supervise the monks and nuns in regard to their conduct and study. Authorship The first s≈´tra in the SthƒÅnƒÅnga goes as follows: s≈´yam me ƒÅusam tenam BhagavayƒÅ evam akkhƒÅyam - \\"I have heard, o Long-Lived one, that the Venerable (i.e. MahƒÅvƒ´ra) has said thus.\\" From this it can be gauged that as per the tradition it was recited by ganadhara Sudharman, the fifth direct disciple of MahƒÅvƒ´ra, to his disciple Jamb≈´svƒÅmin. Contribution to Indian Mathematics Sthananga Sutra lists the topics which made up the mathematics studied from the time of 2nd century BCE onwards. In fact this list of topics sets the scene for the areas of study for a long time to come in the Indian subcontinent. The topics are listed in G G Joseph, The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics (London, 1991) as:- the theory of numbers, arithmetical operations, geometry, operations with fractions, simple equations, cubic equations, quartic equations, and permutations and combinations. It also gives classifications of five types of infinities. The topics of mathematics, according to the Sthananga-sutra (sutra 747) are ten in numbers: *Parikarma (four fundamental operations), *Vyavahara (subjects of treatment), *Rajju (geometry), *Rashi (mensuration of solid bodies), *Kalasavarna (fractions), *Yavat-tavat (simple equation), *Varga (quadratic equation), *Ghana (cubic equation), *Varga-varga (biquadratic equation) and *Vikalpa (permutation and combination). However, the historians of mathematics differ in explaining some of the terms from the commentator, Abhayadeva Suri (1050 AD).

The BATS cruises began in 1988 but are supplemented by biweekly Hydrostation \\"S\\" cruises to a neighbouring location () that began in 1954. The data collected by these cruises are available online. Scientific Findings Between 1998 and 2013, research conducted at BATS has generated over 450 peer- reviewed articles. Among the findings are measurements showing the gradual acidification of the surface ocean, where surface water pH, carbonate ion concentration, and the saturation state for calcium carbonate minerals, such as aragonite, have all decreased since 1998. Additionally, studies at BATS have shown changes in the Revelle factor, suggesting that the capacity of North Atlantic Ocean surface waters to absorb carbon dioxide has diminished, even as seawater pCO2 has kept pace with increasing atmospheric pCO2.

Trained alongside his brothers by his father and grandfather, Kanze made his Noh stage debut at the age of three. After World War II ended, Kanze attended the Tokyo Music School, although he dropped out before completing his studies. With his family running one of Japan's five main Noh schools, Kanze was controversially adopted by another school, the Kita group, for 11 years. His activities caused an uproar in the Noh community, and he quit the movement, acting in conventional drama and films.Noh performance of Paul Claudel's drama in verse , Kippo News, April 7, 2004.

In the , Cecil Plains had a population of 429 people.  Geography  Cecil Plains is in the Darling Downs, west of the state capital, Brisbane. The fertile black soil around Cecil Plains is ideal for cotton production and the town is now the home of one of the largest cotton gins in the southern hemisphere. History European settlement in the area began in 1842, when Henry Stuart Russell claimed land around the Condamine River to establish Cecil Plains station. The site of the station homestead was to become the site of the town. Ludwig Leichhardt used the homestead as a base for two expeditions into the surrounding region in 1844 and 1847. The station originally grazed cattle but later moved to wool production. The town takes its name from the pastoral station, which in turn was named after Russell's mother Cecil Charlotte Russell, n√©e Pemberton. In 1877, of land was resumed from the Cecil Plains pastoral run to establish smaller farms. The land was offered for selection on 24 April 1877. Cecil Plains Provisional School opened on 17 January 1898. It closed briefly in 1910 and 1912 and then again from 10 October 1917 to 17 June 1919. It became Cecil Plains State School on 1 February 1922. In 1964 a secondary department was added. In 1975 a pre-school centre was added. In 1916, Cecil Plains station was acquired by the Queensland government and subdivided for closer settlement, with some parcels reserved for soldier settlers. The new settlers produced mainly wheat and dairy. The Cecil Plains railway arrived in 1919 with the town being served by the Cecil Plains railway station ().The Oakey Region Tulk, Darren Australian Railway History, August, 2008 pp251-264 The post office in 1921 (a receiving office had been open from 1890).

St Margaret's Anglican Church was dedicated on Sunday 2 January 1927 by Archdeacon Glover. The architect was Mr Marks of Toowoomba and the timber church was built by J. Johnson of Dalby. A police station opened in 1934. The local pub is called the Victory Hotel, as a result of a successful vote in 1938 (on the third attempt) to establish a drinking establishment in the town. From the 1960s cotton became the main crop grown in the area. In the , Cecil Plains had a population of 678 people.  Recreation  Cecil Plains is host to a number of recreational facilities, including the Cecil Plains Golf Club and Apex Park at the Cecil Plains Weir.

Laurent currently owns establishments in San Francisco. He was the Corporate Executive Chef of Aqua, an upscale seafood restaurant in San Francisco, where he earned 2 Michelin stars in 2006, the first time Michelin came to the San Francisco Bay Area, and again in 2007 and 2008. Upon his departure in 2009, the restaurant lost its Michelin status (it was closed in 2010). Since 2005 Laurent has owned Cafe de la Presse, located on the corner of Bush Street and Grant Avenue, as well as two wine bars: Blanc et Rouge and Herlen Place. Biography Manrique discovered his culinary passion during childhood while cooking with his grandmother Aur√©lie in the Gascon village of Roques. Following an apprenticeship several years later with master chef Roger Duffour, Manrique trained with master chefs Claude Deligne and Yan Jacquot at Michelin-starred Taillevent and Toit de Passy in Paris. Following a suggestion to move to United States, Manrique pursued his culinary career at Los Angeles Italian restaurant Rex. Persuaded by restaurateur Jean Denoyer to join Manhattan's Le Comptoir as executive chef, he relocated to the East Coast in 1991. Then in 1992 at the age of 26, Manrique took over as chef at the Waldorf Astoria's Peacock Alley. After a five-year relationship with the restaurant, Manrique joined with nightlife mogul Howard Stein to open Gertrudes in 1997. Shortly thereafter the West Coast beckoned, and Manrique returned to join San Francisco's Campton Palace restaurant as Executive Chef. In 2003, Manrique was named Corporate Executive Chef for Aqua. Manrique's cuisine and leadership were to play a significant role in the restaurant's extraordinary success in San Francisco, including two Michelin stars in 2006, which he upheld for three consecutive years. Meanwhile, he opened Cafe de la Presse and Rouge & Blance Wine Bar, which remain some of San Francisco's most popular dining venues. In 2007, Manrique united with friend and colleague Christopher Condy, to form a joint venture, resulting in the creation of C&L; partners, a restaurant development, operating and investment company. Laurent helped guide C&L; through the reopening of the Fifth Floor restaurant at the Palomar Hotel for the Kimpton Group in 2008, followed by the opening of the Urban Tavern at the San Francisco Hilton. Manrique and Condy have teamed up with Meredith Gelacek, former Hilton Hotels Vice President of Food & Beverage, and Peter Chase, former Vice President of Bars for Ian Schrager Hotels, to form Collective Hospitality. Together the group opened Millesime in November 2010, a casual seafood brasserie in New York City's Carlton Hotel. The restaurant quickly earned praise including a two-star review from the New York Times, and a two- and-a-half-star review from the New York Post. One of the signature and most popular dishes at Millesime is its tuna tartare, a recipe for which Manrique shared with the public on NBC in winter 2010.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2y-8-5SNeA Personal life Since 2003, Manrique has been involved in vineyards here and abroad, where he has been instrumental in the creation of several wines. Manrique partnered with Master Sommelier Emmanuel Kemiji and a vineyard in Spain, Clos Oblidat and Arrels (which means roots of a vine in Catalon) is the inaugural release. Manrique is married to writer Michelle Odom Manrique, and makes his home with their children in northern California.

He was born in Herrera, Palencia, the nephew of Dr. Torres, Bishop of the Canaries. He studied at Salamanca and lived in Rome with Cardinal Giovanni Salviati and Seripando. In 1562 Pope Pius IV sent him to the Council of Trent, and on 8 January, 1567, he became a Jesuit. He was professor at the Roman College, took part in the revision of the Sixtine Vulgate, and had Hosius and Baronius for literary associates. His contemporaries called him helluo librorum (glutton of books) for the rapidity with which he examined the principal libraries. In the last several years of his life, Turrianus had an ongoing battle of books with the French Protestant Antoine de la Roche Chandieu. He remained in Rome, where he died. He defended the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception, the authority of the sovereign pontiff over the council, the Divinely appointed authority of bishops, Communion under one kind for the laity, the authenticity of the Apostolic Canons and the Pseudo-Isidorian decretals, and pleading the antiquity of the feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin, which Pius V had suppressed, worked for its reinstatement. David Blondel accuses him of a lack of critical judgment, and G√©r√≥nimo Nad√†l accused him of mordacity against Protestants. He wrote more than seventy books, principally polemical, against Protestants, and translations especially of Greek Fathers, many treatises of whose works he found hidden away in libraries.

The area is mostly residential, centering on Dosthill High Street, with local employment on the adjoining Tame Valley Industrial Estate. The High Street includes a public house called 'The Fox' and Dosthill Primary School (photo) which dates back to 1887.  History  Dosthill is a small ancient hamlet and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. It has quickly grown in size up until recent centuries, when a large number of housing developments have been constructed. The area will continue to grow in size in the near future, with many more planning proposals in the pipeline and the area becoming more desirable to young families. Dosthill School was 125 years old in 2012 Until 1965 Dosthill was a village in the county of Warwickshire, associated with the larger village of Kingsbury, Warwickshire some three miles to the south. The county boundaries were altered in that year partly to accommodate the expanding town of Tamworth, Staffordshire and Dosthill became part of that town, moving into Staffordshire by default. The nearby hamlet of Whateley remained in Warwickshire. The county boundary is now at the southern edge of the village. Originally most of the buildings in the area were agricultural. In the late 18th and 19th centuries the village was developed with the building of a number of farms and cottages. By the 20th century Dosthill had been transformed into a coalmining and brick making village. There are 2 important historical buildings in the village which form part of a conservation area. The oldest building is Dosthill Chapel, which is a Norman building that dates from the 12th century, but has some later additional architectural features. The building is now used as a Sunday school, day nursery and parish room. Cruck Bern is one of the most important timber framed buildings in the area and dates from the 15th century. In 1870 St. Paul's Church was opened and replaced Dosthill Chapel as the principal place of worship. The building was designed by Edward Holmes of Birmingham. The church continues to be a functioning parish church. The foundation stone was laid by Farmer Cheatle, a member of one of the main four original families of Dosthill. The other three families are the Laytons, Tolsons and Tromans, descendants of whom still live in the village today. Dosthill Hall is also a building of historic significance. It is a Georgian mansion originally owned by the Tolson family. Some people have linked Dosthill Hall with Sir Robert Peel but Sir Robert Peel or the Peel family neither lived at Dosthill Hall nor ever owned it. The building and grounds have now been restored and converted into a number of apartments.  Leisure  Dosthill is a popular place for scuba divers, water skiers and bird watchers. A former quarry is now a diving centre and is considered to be the oldest inland dive site in the country.Dive In Centre The quarry site consists of several submerged features for divers to explore, including numerous vans, caravans and other vehicles. There are also some good diving platforms for training. No other water activities such as fishing, water skiing, or the use of speed boats or jet skis are allowed on this site. Greenhill Close was named after Florence Greenhill, a local nurse and midwife, who became known for delivering babies while bombs fell around her and her patients. After World War II she served for a time on Tamworth Town Council. Dosthill Lake is home to the West Midlands Water Ski Centre and has been designated as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) due to its winter waterfowl populations, swamp vegetation and marshy grassland. From 2020 it is part of Dosthill Park Local Nature Reserve. A public right of way to Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve, west of the river (and mostly in Warwickshire) exists, but the public bridge over the river collapsed and in 2016 was replaced close to the same site. Some pools east of the river are also part of the reserve.

It was founded and owned by David and Kay Canter and Daphne Swann, and its flagship restaurant was at Marshall Street in the West End of London. History The first Cranks opened at 22 Carnaby Street, London, in 1961. There were very few vegetarian restaurants in the United Kingdom at the time, and wholefoods were hard to get. Although by no way the first vegetarian restaurant in the U.K. - Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet opened a successful vegetarian restaurant in Manchester as early as the 1880s - Friederichs, Hulda (1911). George Newnes. London: Hodder & Stoughton (1911) Kessinger Publishing (2008). . (re-published 2008) Cranks has been seen as a major factor in the spread of vegetarianism in recent decades.Obituary of Kay Canter In the 1950s, David Canter had become persuaded that good health depended on unrefined wholefoods and a vegetarian diet. While he was converting premises in Carnaby Street for the Craft Potters Association (of which he was a co-founder), a vacant bakery came on to the market nearby and Canter decided to take it. At that time Carnaby Street was, in Canter's words \\"not swinging, but a street of small shops and caf√©s.\\"David Canter, Kay Canter, Daphne Swann, The Cranks Recipe Book, Panther, 1982, The Cranks menu at first consisted mainly of salads. David Canter wrote that, \\"In contrast to the traditional tired lettuce that makes the appetite wilt too, these salads could change the eater's whole view of vegetables. The vivid combinations of ingredients and colours, crisp from cutting and dressing, were teamed with equally fresh wholemeal rolls, savouries and puddings.\\" The restaurant became successful quickly, indicating unmet demand for its original menus. The style of decor was also new, although owing something to 1950s coffee bars. There were solid natural-coloured oak tables, hand thrown stoneware pottery, heather-brown quarry tiles, woven basket lampshades and hand-woven seat covers. Cranks moved to larger premises in Marshall Street in 1967. In the next decade they opened branches at Dartmouth, Totnes, Guildford, Dartington, Heals furniture store in Tottenham Court Road, and the Peter Robinson department store in Oxford Street. A sole franchise, the Cranks Gr√∏nne Buffet, was opened in Copenhagen. David Canter died in 1981. In 1987 Kay Canter and Daphne Swann sold Cranks to Guinness. Opening more branches under a new business plan, the business encountered financial difficulties, attributed by some to a dated image.Colin Blackstock, \\"Veggie chain to close after 40 years\\", The Guardian, 18 December 2001 It was then bought and sold several times, and in the 1990s was rebranded, bringing it in line with contemporary sandwich bars. In 1998 it was bought by Capricorn International, who invested ¬£1.5m in the London branches, but continuing losses forced them to close the restaurants. The brand was then sold to Nando's Grocery Ltd.Cranks may spring up again outside London - 3 January 2002 - CatererSearch Kay Canter died in April 2007 at age 85.\\"Death of a 'Crank'\\" Daphne Swann died on 28 February 2020 at age 95.

Between 1507 and 1679 it was modified and extended in Renaissance style. The Chapel of St. Anna was attached to the building but was demolished in the 18th century and, in its place, a sculpture of Panna Maria was built. Today's Baroque appearance was given by ≈†tiavnica's master mason, Pircker, in the years 1787‚Äì88. Constructional cost was 8444 florens and 15 red cents. A town prison was situated in the basement of the town hall. The beginning of a market was announced from a tower of the town hall.  Notable events  In the council chamber of the town hall the TRACTAT took place on 22 October 1704. This was a peace treaty between the Prince of Transylvania, Francis II R√°k√≥czi and representatives of King Leopold I. Envoys of the English and Dutch governments participated too.  Notable features  Two out of Stiavnica's seven \\"legendary wonders\\" relate to the town hall. One is the clocks on the tower, whose hands are swapped. The big hand shows hours and the small one minutes. Another Stiavnica wonder which belongs to town hall is the entrance, which is not on the front side as expected but on the back. The story goes that it was because members of the council did not want people to know when they ended their meetings and vanished to surrounding taverns. This relates to life in Banska ≈†tiavnica in the past, not nowadays.  Cultural heritage  Attentive visitors are sure to notice the flag of UNESCO beside the national flag of Slovakia in front of the entrance to the town hall. On the right side of the entrance is situated a memorial tablet which reads (in Slovak): > The historical city of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica and its surroundings were entered > into the list of world cultural heritage on December 9, 1993 as confirmation > of their rare cultural value, which deserves protection for the benefit of > the whole of mankind.

The reserve system consists of nine uninhabited islands, four north of Dar es Salaam (Bongoyo, Mbudya, Pangavini and Fungu Yasini) and five south of the city (Inner and Outer Makatumbe, Inner and Outer Sinda and Kendwa Island). It provides protection for several important tropical ecosystems; coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds. Legal status Management of the reserve is governed by the Tanzanian Board of Trustees of Marine Parks and Reserves which is the custodian and overseer of the establishment and management of the Marine Protected Reserves in Tanzania. The Dar es Salaam Marine Reserves were first established under the Fisheries Act of 1970 and in 1998 were transferred to the Marine Parks and Reserves (MPRs), Act No. 29 of 1994. . Threats Visits to the reserve area (especially Bongoyo and Mbudya) are a popular daytrip for both tourists and Tanzanian residents alike, the islands serving as a location for a variety of leisure activities, including snorkelling, sunbathing and hiking. However, over recent years unregulated tourist activities has led to degradation within the reserves. The nearby fishing communities of Kunduchi, Unonio, and Msasani all appear to be heavily dependent on the resources in the reserves and resource over-exploitation is an increasing concern with local fishermen attributing a decline in fish catches over recent years to the use of small mesh nets and dynamite fishing. A decrease in the abundance of fish and coral health, and an increased amount of bleached and broken coral has been noted by divers.

The type genus is Ergasilus. With a few doubtful exceptions all ergasilids are parasitic on fishes. Biology Various species of Ergasilidae parasitise hosts in various habitats, mostly freshwater, but some attack marine species, especially euryhaline fishes such as mullet. Because the best-known species are adapted to attack the gill filaments of the fishes, Ergasilidae are known by common names such as gill lice. However, some species have been found infesting, and presumably causing, external skin lesions of fish. Immature instars and mature males of Ergasilidae are fairly typical free-living planktonic copepods. The mature females also can swim competently and at least one species, Ergasilus chautauquaensis, is not known to be parasitic at all. However, that is exceptional; most adult females are parasitic and have morphological adaptations for attacking the gills of host species of fishes. Though their antennules retain their sensory function, the main second antennae of the adult females are adapted to clinging to the gill filaments of host fishes. In many Ergasilus species it is not clear that mature females are able to release their grip once attached, but when forcibly detached from the host's gills they swim without difficulty. Another adaptation in parasitic females is that their first legs are armed with heavy, blade-like spines, and in some species the joints also are fused, stiffening them and increasing their effectiveness for harvesting host tissue. Once attached to the gills, the females use their first pair of legs to rasp off gill mucus and tissue and move it forward towards the mouth. In the genus Ergasilus only the adult females are parasitic. The planktonic males do not venture inside fishes, so fertilisation must take place before the females attach themselves to the host's gills. Economic significance Since the Ergasilus females attack the gills of fish, a heavy infestation can cause severe damage and secondary infections, interfere with respiration, and sometimes kill the host. In some fisheries and aquacultural enterprises the mortality and morbidity among fish stocks can present serious economic and ecological problems. Genera The family Ergasilidae contains the following genera: *Abergasilus Hewitt, 1978 *Acusicola Cressey, 1970 *Amplexibranchius Thatcher & Paredes, 1985 *Anklobrachius Thatcher, 1999 *Brasergasilus Thatcher & Boeger, 1983 *Dermoergasilus Ho & Do, 1982 *Ergasilus von Nordmann, 1832 *Gamidactylus Thatcher & Boeger, 1984 *Gamispatulus Thatcher & Boeger, 1984 *Gamispinus Thatcher & Boeger, 1984 *Gauchergasilus Montu & Boxshall, 2002 *Majalincola Tang & Kalman, 2008 *Miracetyma Malta, 1993 *Mugilicola Tripathi, 1960 *Neoergasilus Yin, 1956 *Nipergasilus Yamaguti, 1939 *Paeonodes C.

It was originally made from the years 1956 to 1958 but was re-issued in the late 90s, in 2006 in a slightly modified form as the '56 Pro, and again in 2010 as the '56 Single Cutaway. The sound of a U2 is distinctive of the Danelectro guitar, coming from its lipstick pickups which when both selected are wired in series rather than the more standard parallel used today by most big brands. Construction materials used by Danelectro in this period are quite unusual for guitar making. The U2's body is made of a poplar wood frame with Masonite used for both the top and back, with the side of the body being bound with creme coloured vinyl. Both a single-pickup version (the U1) and triple-pickup version (the U3), were manufactured and sold alongside the U2.  Reissues  The U1, U2 and U3 were first reissued between 1998 and 2001, with the U3 including new features such as a six-position switch which would allow the player to select bridge, middle, neck, bridge and neck, bridge and middle, middle and neck, or with the \\"blow\\" switch, all three pickups at once. In 2005 the 56 Pro was released as a limited edition re-issue of the U2. Although a re-issue, the Danelectro 56 Pro had some distinctive changes from the original models, these changes include: *The headstock shape, It has a slight cut out on the 56 Pro. *No vinyl which bound the sides of the guitar on the originals. *Master Tone & Volume, rather than the Danelectro trademark concentric \\"Stacked\\" pots. *An upgraded bridge with adjustments for intonation. *Higher output lipstick pickups than the originals and the first reissues. *Metal strap buttons to replace the plastic ones of previous models (also, top button is now on the upper bout of the body rather than its original position on the treble side of the neck) *Black headstock rather than the matched headstock and body colour of the originals and first reissues. *Reshaped pickguard (longer and wider than the original design).

The words () \\"Republic of Armenia\\" and () \\"Passport\\" on Armenian and English languages also appear on the front cover. The passport is valid for 10 years from the time of issue, with the further possibility of extending validity for an additional 5 years. The possibility of extending the passport by 5 years was eliminated in August 2017. It contains 32 pages for special notes and visas, and information about its holder in both the Armenian and English languages. Since 1 June 2012, two new ID-documents are introduced, which will replace the ordinary passports of Armenian citizens. One of the documents ‚Äì the ID card ‚Äî will be used locally within the country, and the second document ‚Äì the biometric passport ‚Äî will be used for traveling abroad. An electronic chip on the passport will contain digital images of fingerprints and photo of passport holder. Both biometric passports and eID cards are produced by Polish Security Printing Works (Polska Wytwornia Papierow Wartosciowych).http://www.pwpw.pl/index.php?pId=597 Old style (non-biometric) passports were re-introduced in 2016 on a temporary basis (until January 1, 2019), and currently Armenian citizens can acquire both biometric and regular passports. Armenian citizen ID card Armenia abolished the visa requirement for citizens of the Schengen states From 1 January 2013 Armenia will drop the requirement of an entry visa for the 27 EU countries and 4 additional countries, fulfilling the requirements of the Schengen Agreement (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). By unilateral abolition of the visa regime, Armenia seeks to accelerate negotiations with the EU on visa facilitation. According to the planned agreement with the EU, the procedure for obtaining Schengen visas for citizens of Armenia would be facilitated. The simplified procedure is provided for members of official delegations, researchers, students, journalists, those in sports and the arts, and for close relatives of citizens legally residing in the EU. It is also intended to reduce visa costs by 35 euros to free for these categories, as well as for children and pensioners. For more info see at E-visa system.

Early history \\"Europe\\" as a cultural sphere is first used during the Carolingian dynasty to encompass the Latin Church (as opposed to Eastern Orthodoxy). Military unions of \\"European powers\\" in the medieval and early modern period were directed against the threat of Islamic expansion. Thus, in the wake of the Fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, George of Podebrady, a Hussite king of Bohemia, proposed in 1464 a union of European, Christian nations against the Turks. William Penn, an American colonist, proposed a European Parliament to prevent war In 1693, William Penn looked at the devastation of war in Europe and wrote of a \\"European dyet, or parliament\\", to prevent further war, without further defining how such an institution would fit into the political reality of Europe at the time. In 1728, Abbot Charles de Saint-Pierre proposed the creation of a European league of 18 sovereign states, with common treasury, no borders and an economic union. After the American Revolutionary War the vision of a United States of Europe, similar to the United States of America, was shared by a few prominent Europeans, notably the Marquis de Lafayette and Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. Some suggestion of a European union can be inferred from Immanuel Kant's 1795 proposal for an \\"eternal peace congress\\". 19th century The concept of \\"Europe\\" referring to Western Europe or Germanic Europe arises in the 19th century, contrasting with the Russian Empire, as is evidenced in Russian philosopher Danilevsky's Russia and Europe. French-dominated Europe in 1812 In the 1800s, a customs union under Napoleon Bonaparte's Continental system was promulgated in November 1806 as an embargo of British goods in the interests of the French hegemony. Felix Markham notes how during a conversation on St. Helena, Napoleon remarked, \\"Europe thus divided into nationalities freely formed and free internally, peace between States would have become easier: the United States of Europe would become a possibility.\\"Felix Markham, Napoleon (New York: Penguin Books USA Inc., 1966), 257 as quoted in Matthew Zarzeczny, Napoleon's European Union: The Grand Empire of the United States of Europe (Kent State University Master's thesis), 2. The French socialists Saint-Simon and Augustin Thierry would in 1814 write the essay De la r√©organisation de la soci√©t√© europ√©enne, already conjuring up some form of parliamentary European federation. French novelist Victor Hugo argued, in 1849, that \\"A day will come when we shall see... the United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas.\\" In the conservative reaction after Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the German Confederation () was established as a loose association of thirty-eight sovereign German states formed by the Congress of Vienna. Napoleon had swept away the Holy Roman Empire and simplified the map of Germany. In 1834, the Zollverein (\\"customs union\\") was formed among the states of the Confederation, to create better trade flow and reduce internal competition. An extension of this customs union may have become the model for a unified Europe, as alluded to by Fritz Fischer in Germany's Aims in the First World War. The then current ideas of geopolitics and a Mitteleuropa were also influential in providing an intellectual framework for European Union in Germany. United States of Europe was also the name of the concept presented by Wojciech Jastrzƒôbowski in About eternal peace between the nations, published 31 May 1831. The project consisted of 77 articles. The envisioned United States of Europe was to be an international organisation rather than a superstate. Italian writer and politician Giuseppe Mazzini called for the creation of a federation of European republics in 1843. This set the stage for perhaps the best known early proposal for peaceful unification, through cooperation and equality of membership, made by the pacifist Victor Hugo in 1847. Hugo used the term United States of Europe () during a speech at the International Peace Congress, organised by Mazzini, held in Paris in 1849. Hugo favoured the creation of \\"a supreme, sovereign senate, which will be to Europe what parliament is to England\\" and said \\"A day will come when all nations on our continent will form a European brotherhood ... A day will come when we shall see ... the United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas.\\" However, he was laughed out of the hall, yet returned to his idea again in 1851. Victor Hugo planted a tree in the grounds of his residence on the Island of Guernsey he was noted in saying that when this tree matured the United States of Europe would have come into being. This tree to this day is still growing happily in the gardens of Maison de Hauteville, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, Victor Hugo's residence during his exile from France. The Italian philosopher Carlo Cattaneo wrote \\"The ocean is rough and whirling, and the currents go to two possible endings: the autocrat, or the United States of Europe\\". In 1867 Giuseppe Garibaldi, and John Stuart Mill joined Victor Hugo at a congress of the League of Peace and Freedom in Geneva. Here the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin stated \\"That in order to achieve the triumph of liberty, justice and peace in the international relations of Europe, and to render civil war impossible among the various peoples which make up the European family, only a single course lies open: to constitute the United States of Europe\\". The French National Assembly, also called for a United States of Europe on 1 March 1871. As part of 19th c. concerns about an ailing Europe and the threat posed by the Mahdi, the Polish writer, Theodore de Korwin Szymanowski's original contribution was to focus not on nationalism, sovereignty and federation, but foremost on economics, statistics, monetary policy and parliamentary reform. His L'Avenir √©conomique, politique et social en Europe ‚Äì The Future of Europe in Economic, Political and Social Terms ‚Äì published in Paris in 1885 was in effect, a blueprint for a unified Europe with a customs union, a central statistical office, a central bank and a single currency. Between the World Wars Europa coin for the hypothetical \\"Federated States of Europe\\" (√âtats f√©d√©r√©s d'Europe) Following the catastrophe of the First World War, thinkers and visionaries from a range of political traditions again began to float the idea of a politically unified Europe. In the early 1920s a range of internationals were founded (or re- founded) to help like-minded political parties to coordinate their activities. These ranged from the Comintern (1919), to the Labour and Socialist International (1921) to the Radical and Democratic Entente of centre-left progressive parties (1924), to the Green International of farmers' parties (1923), to the centre-right International Secretariat of Democratic Parties Inspired by Christianity (1925). While the remit of these internationals was global, the predominance of political parties from Europe meant that they facilitated interaction between the adherents of a given ideology, across European borders. Within each political tradition, voices emerged advocating not merely the cooperation of various national parties, but the pursuit of political institutions at the European level. With a conservative vision of Europe, the Austrian Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the Pan- Europa movement in 1923, hosting the First Paneuropean Congress in Vienna in 1926, and which contained 8000 members by the time of the Wall Street Crash. The aim was for a specifically Christian, and by implication Catholic, Europe. The British civil servant and future Conservative minister Arthur Salter published a book advocating The United States of Europe in 1933. In contrast the Soviet commissar (minister) Leon Trotsky raised the slogan \\"For a Soviet United States of Europe\\" in 1923, advocating a Europe united along communist principles. Among liberal-democratic parties, the French centre-left undertook several initiatives to group like-minded parties from the European states. In 1927, the French politician Emil Borel, a leader of the centre-left Radical Party and the founder of the Radical International, set up a French Committee for European Cooperation, and a further twenty countries set up equivalent committees. However, it remained an elite venture: the largest committee, the French one, possessed fewer than six-hundred members, two-thirds of whom were parliamentarians. Two centre-left French prime ministers went further. In 1929 Aristide Briand gave a speech in the presence of the League of Nations Assembly in which he proposed the idea of a federation of European nations based on solidarity and in the pursuit of economic prosperity and political and social co-operation. In 1930, at the League's request, Briand presented a Memorandum on the organisation of a system of European Federal Union. The next year the future French prime minister √âdouard Herriot published his book The United States of Europe. Indeed, a template for such a system already existed, in the form of the 1921 Belgian and Luxembourgish customs and monetary union. Support for the proposals by the French centre-left came from a range of prestigious figures. Many eminent economists, aware that the economic race-to- the-bottom between states was creating ever greater instability, supported the view: these included John Maynard Keynes. The French political scientist and economist Bertrand Jouvenel remembered a widespread mood after 1924 calling for a \\"harmonisation of national interests along the lines of European union, for the purpose of common prosperity\\". The Spanish philosopher and politician, Ortega y Gasset, expressed a position shared by many within Republican Spain: \\"European unity is no fantasy, but reality itself; and the fantasy is precisely the opposite: the belief that France, Germany, Italy or Spain are substantive & independent realities.‚Äù Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister of Greece, outlined his government's support in a 1929 speech by saying that \\"the United States of Europe will represent, even without Russia, a power strong enough to advance, up to a satisfactory point, the prosperity of the other continents as well\\". Between the two world wars, the Polish statesman J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski envisaged the idea of a European federation that he called Miƒôdzymorze (\\"Intersea\\" or \\"Between-seas\\"), known in English as Intermarum, which was a Polish-oriented version of Mitteleuropa. The Great Depression, the rise of fascism and communism and subsequently World War II prevented the inter war movements from gaining further support: between 1933 and 1936 most of Europe's remaining democracies became dictatorships, and even Ortega's Spain and Venizelos's Greece had both been plunged into civil war. But although the supporters of European unity, whether social-democratic, liberal or Christian-democratic, were out of power during the 1930s and unable to put their ideas into practice, many would find themselves in power in the 1940s and 1950s, and better-placed to put into effect their earlier remedies against economic and political crisis. Impact of the Second World War In Britain the group known as Federal Union was launched in November 1938, and began advocating a Federal Union of Europe as a post-war aim. Its papers and arguments became well known among resistants to fascism across Europe and contributed to their thinking of how to rebuild Europe after the war. Among those who were early advocates of a union of European nations was Hungarian Prime Minister P√°l Teleki. Hungary had lost over two-thirds of its territory at the end of World War I in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. In early 1941 during the Second World War, he was striving to keep Hungary autonomous. Internally, he tried to satisfy national pride which demanded a restoration of the lost territories, which Germany had supported in the First Vienna Award of 1938 and the Second Vienna Award of 1940. Externally, he was striving to preserve his country's military and economic independence in the face of Germany's coercive pressure to join in their invasion of Yugoslavia. In the book, Transylvania. The Land Beyond the Forest Louis C. Cornish described how Teleki, under constant surveillance by the German Gestapo during 1941, sent a secret communication to contacts in America. Journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1941 supported the statement of others. \\"I took from Count Teleki's office a monograph which he had written upon the structure of European nations. A distinguished geographer, he was developing a plan for regional federation, based upon geographical and economic realities.\\" Teleki received no response from the Americans to his ideas and when German troops moved through Hungary on 2‚Äì3 April 1941 during the invasion of Yugoslavia, he committed suicide. In 1943, the German ministers Joachim von Ribbentrop and Cecil von Renthe-Fink eventually proposed the creation of a \\"European confederacy\\" as part of a New Order on the continent. The proposal, which attracted little support from the Nazi leadership, would have had a single currency, a central bank in Berlin, a regional principle, a labour policy and economic and trading agreements but left all states clearly subordinated to Nazi Germany. The countries proposed for inclusion were Germany, Italy, France, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Greece and Spain. Such a German- led Europe, it was hoped, would serve as a strong alternative to the Communist Soviet Union and the United States. It is worth noting that the Benelux countries are omitted from the list of proposed countries, as their future integration into the German Reich had already been decided. The later Foreign Minister Arthur Seyss-Inquart said: \\"The new Europe of solidarity and co- operation among all its people will find rapidly increasing prosperity once national economic boundaries are removed\\", while the Vichy French Minister Jacques Benoist-M√©chin said that France had to \\"abandon nationalism and take place in the European community with honour.\\" These pan-European illusions from the early 1940s were never realised because of Germany's defeat. Neither Hitler, nor many of his leading hierarchs such as Goebbels, had the slightest intention of compromising absolute German hegemony through the creation of a European confederation. Although this fact has been used to insinuate the charge of fascism in the EU, the idea is much older than the Nazis, foreseen by John Maynard Keynes, and later Winston Churchill and various anti-Nazi resistance movements.Mark Mazower, Dark Continent, 1.30 One of the most influential figures in this process was Altiero Spinelli,https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/history/eu-pioneers_en author of the Ventotene Manifesto entitled \\"Towards a Free and United Europe\\" and smuggled out of their internment camp ‚Äì the island of Ventotene ‚Äì as early as 1941, well before the outcome of the war was safely predictable, and widely circulated in the resistance movements. Spinelli, Ursula Hirschmann and Colorni, Rossi and some 20 othershttps://europa.eu/european-union/about- eu/history/eu-pioneers_enestablished, as soon as they were able to leave their internment camp, the Movimento Federalista Europeo (MFE). The founding meeting, secretly held in Milan on the 27/28 August 1943, adopted a \\"political thesis\\" which, inter alia, stated: \\"if a post war order is established in which each State retains its complete national sovereignty, the basis for a Third World War would still exist even after the Nazi attempt to establish the domination of the German race in Europe has been frustrated\\". In 1943, Jean Monnet a member of the National Liberation Committee of the Free French government in exile in Algiers, and regarded by many as the future architect of European unity, is recorded as declaring to the committee: \\"There will be no peace in Europe, if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty ... The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation ...\\"  See also  * Federal Europe * Pan-European identity * European integration * History of the European Union * Universal Monarchy  References  Further reading * Dedman, Martin.

He served in the British Army during World War I. He was a director of the Eagle Star Insurance Company and Chairman of Vulcanite Ltd. Military career Sincliar served in the Royal Irish Rifles and Royal Irish Fusiliers during World War I, attaining the rank of Captain. In October 1937 he raised and commanded the Antrim Fortress Royal Engineers at Victoria Barracks, Belfast, one of the first Territorial Army (TA) units in Northern Ireland. He was promoted to the local rank of Major, and was awarded the honorary rank after his retirement from the command.

Political career His first attempt to be elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland was unsuccessful; he contested the Mourne division in 1933. He was elected to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1938 for the division of Belfast Cromac. On 16 January 1941, he was appointed Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Minister of Finance (i.e. a junior minister). In May 1943, Sir Basil Brooke succeeded John Miller Andrews as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland; Maynard Sinclair was appointed Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) in the Government of Northern Ireland on 6 May 1943 and was made a Privy Councillor (Northern Ireland). He was regarded by the officers of his TA unit as a much more liberal individual than his Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke. The opinion of those former officers who knew him was that his politics were not unlike those of Captain Terence O'Neill and that, had he lived to become Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, the complete history of the province would have been different.

The plant is native to the Western United States, often in xeric (extremely dry) and desert habitats. It is found in the Great Basin Deserts and Mojave Desert. The Latin specific epithet pulchellum means ‚Äúpretty‚Äù, ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù. Description Dodecatheon pulchellum is a herbaceous perennial with single, leafless flower stems, growing from very short erect root stocks with no bulblets. It grows to a height of . Its leaves are basal, 2‚Äì15 cm long, blades oblong-lanceolate to oblanceolate, mostly entire to somewhat small-toothed, narrowed gradually to winged stalks nearly as long. Each plant has between 1 and 25 flowers clustered at the stem top. The calyx is usually purple-flecked, and the five lobes are 3 to 5 millimeters long. The corolla is 10 to 20 millimeters long, the 5 lobes swept backwards, purplish-lavender, seldom white, the short tube yellowish, usually with a purplish wavy line at the base. The filaments are joined into a yellowish tube 1.5‚Äì3 mm long, which is smooth or only slightly wrinkled. The 5 anthers are joined to a projecting point, usually yellowish to reddish-purple, 4‚Äì7 mm long. The stigma is slightly larger than the style. This plant flowers between April and August. The fruits are capsules, many-seeded, ovoid- cylindric, hairless to glandular-hairy, membranous to firm-walled, 5‚Äì15 mm long, opening from the tip into sharp teeth. Dodecatheon pulchellum has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. In cultivation it is hardy down to , but prefers a sheltered location in partial or full shade with neutral or acid soil, such as a woodland setting. Native Americans Dodecatheon pulchellum, pretty shooting star, was used medicinally by the Okanagan-Colville and Blackfoot Indians. An infusion of the roots was used as a wash for sore eyes. A cooled infusion of leaves was used for eye drops. An infusion of leaves was gargled, especially by children, for cankers.

In 1951 the first community, the European Coal and Steel Community was established and moves on new communities quickly began. Early attempts at military and political unity failed, eventually leading to the Treaties of Rome in 1957. Beginnings of cooperation The Second World War from 1939 to 1945 saw an unprecedented human and economic cost, in which Europe was affected particularly severely through the totality of modern warfare and large scale massacres such as the Holocaust. Once again, there was a widespread desire amongst European governments to ensure it could never happen again, particularly with the war giving the world nuclear weapons and two ideologically opposed superpowers.Europe in ruins in the aftermath of the Second World War on CVCE. Historical events in the European integration process (1945‚Äì2009) (See: Cold War) In 1946, war-time British Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke at the University of Zurich on \\"The tragedy of Europe\\"; in which he called for a \\"United States of Europe\\", to be created on a regional level while strengthening the UN. He described the first step to a \\"USE\\" as a \\"Council of Europe\\".The Zurich speech CVCE - Historical events in the European integration process (1945‚Äì2009) London would, in 1949, be the location for the signing of the Treaty of London, establishing the separate entity of the Council of Europe. In 1948, the Congress of Europe was convened in the Hague, under Winston Churchill's chairmanship, by the European unification movements. It was the first time all the movements had come together under one roof and attracted a myriad of statesmen including many who would later become known as founding fathers of the European Union. The congress discussed the formation of a new Council of Europe and led to the establishment of the European Movement and the College of Europe, however it exposed a division between unionist (opposed to a loss of sovereignty) and federalist (desiring a federal Europe) supporters.The Congress of Europe in The Hague (7‚Äì10 May 1948) ‚Äì Introduction. CVCE This unionist-federalist divide was reflected in the establishment of the Council of Europe in 1949. The Council was designed with two main political bodies, one composed of governments, the other of national members of parliament. Based in Strasbourg, it is an organisation dealing with democracy and human rights issues (today covering nearly every European state).The Council of Europe CVCE With the start of the Cold War, the Treaty of Brussels was signed in 1948. It expanded upon the Dunkirk Treaty which was a military pact between France and the United Kingdom who were concerned about the threat from the USSR following the communist take over in Czechoslovakia. The new treaty included the Benelux countries and was to promote cooperation not only in the military matters but in economic, social and cultural spheres. These roles however were rapidly taken over by other organisations.Western Union, CVCE In 1954 it would be amended by the Paris Agreements which created the Western European Union which would take on European defence and be merged into the EU in later decades.Western European Union, CVCE - Historical events in the European integration process (1945‚Äì2009) However the signatories of the Brussels treaty quickly realised their common defence was not enough against the USSR. However wider solidarity, such as that seen over the Berlin Blockade in 1949, was seen to provide sufficient deterrent. Hence in 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was created. It expanded the Brussels treaty members to include Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal as well as Canada and most notably the United States. Military integration in NATO sped up following the first Soviet atomic bomb test and the start of the Korean War which prompted a desire for the inclusion of West Germany.NATO - North Atlantic Treaty Organisation CVCE In the same year as the Brussels treaty, Sweden plans for a Scandinavian defence union (of Sweden, Denmark and Norway) which would be neutral in regards to the proposed NATO. However, due to pressure from the United States, Norway and Denmark joined NATO and the plans collapsed. Although a \\"'Scandinavian joint committee for economic cooperation\\" was established which led to a customs union under the Nordic Council which held its first meeting in 1953.The plan for a Nordic customs union and common market, CVCE Similar economic activity was taking place between the Benelux countries. The Benelux Customs Union became operative between Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. During the war, the three governments in exile signed a customs convention between their countries. This followed a monetary agreement which fixed their currencies against each other. This integration would lead to an economic union and the countries cooperating in foreign affairs as the union was out of a desire to strengthen their position as small states. However the Benelux became a precursor and provided ground for later European integration.Benelux, CVCE Coal and Steel Founding members of the Community in 1952 Robert Schuman, as Prime Minister of France 1947-8 and Foreign Minister 1948‚Äì53 gradually but completely changed the Gaullist policy in Europe which aimed at weakening Germany and permanently taking over part of its borderlands. He gained increasing support for this policy both in the French Assembly and with European public opinion but it was fiercely opposed both by Gaullists and by Communists, and inside other parties including his own. On 9 May 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman (on the basis of a text prepared by Schuman's colleagues Paul Reuter and Bernard Clappier working with Jean Monnet, Pierre Uri and Etienne Hirsch) made his Schuman declaration at the Quai d'Orsay,. He proposed that: \\"Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe.\\" Such an act was intended to help economic growth and cement peace between France and Germany, who had previously been longtime enemies. Coal and steel were particular symbolic as they were the resources necessary to wage war. It would also be a first step to a \\"European federation\\".The Declaration of 9 May 1950 CVCEIs Europe a federal or a supranational union? http://www.schuman.info/fed.htm The declaration led to the Treaty of Paris (1951) forming the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), it was formed by \\"the inner six\\": France, Italy, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg) together with West Germany. The United Kingdom refused to participate due to a rejection of supranational authority.The beginning of the negotiations CVCE The common market was opened on 10 February 1953 for coal, and on 1 May 1953 for steel. During the existence of the ECSC, steel production would improve and increase fourfold. Coal production however would decline but its technology, safety and environmental quality would improve. ECSC helped deal with crises in the industry and ensured balanced development and distribution of resources. However the treaty, unlike its successors, was designed to expire after 50 years. Therefore, the Community ceased to exist on 2002-07-23 with all its activities and finances being transferred to the European Community. First institutions Seat of the High Authority in Luxembourg With the treaty of Paris, the first institutions were created. At its centre was the High Authority (what is now the European Commission), the first ever supranational body which served as the Community's executive, the first president of which was Jean Monnet. The President was elected by the eight other members he presided over. The nine members were appointed by the member states (two for the larger three states, one for the smaller three) but they did not represent their member states, rather the common interest. The member states' governments were represented by the Council of Ministers, the Presidency of which rotated between each state every three months in alphabetical order. It was added at the request of smaller states, fearing undue influence from the High Authority. Its task was to harmonise the work of national governments with the acts of the High Authority, as well as issue opinions on the work of the Authority when needed. Hence, unlike the modern Council, this body had limited powers as issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, whereas the Council only had to give its consent to decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, it only scrutinised and advised the executive which was independent. The Common Assembly, what is now the European Parliament, was composed of 78 representatives. The Assembly exercised supervisory powers over the executive. The representatives were to be national MPs elected by their Parliaments to the Assembly, or directly elected. Though in practice it was the former as there was no requirement until the Treaties of Rome and no election until 1979. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not to be that of a traditional international organisation, whereby it would be composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term \\"representatives of the peoples\\". The Assembly was not originally mentioned in the Schuman Declaration but put forward by Jean Monnet on the second day of treaty negotiations. It was still hoped that the Assembly of the Council of Europe would be the active body and the supranational Community would be inserted inside as one of the Council's institutions. The assembly was intended as a democratic counter- weight and check to the High Authority. It had formal powers to sack the High Authority, following investigation of abuse. The Court of Justice was to ensure the observation of ECSC law along with the interpretation and application of the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General. Finally, there was a Consultative Committee (what is now the Economic and Social Committee) which had between 30 and 50 members, equally divided between producers, workers, consumers and dealers in the coal and steel sector. This grouping provided a chamber of professional associations for civil society and was in permanent dialogue with the High Authority on policy and proposals for legislation. Its Opinions were necessary before such action could take place. The threefold division of its members prevented any one group, whether business, labour or consumers, from dominating proceedings, as majority voting was required. Its existence curtailed the activity of lobbyists acting to influence governments on such policy. The Consultative Committee had an important action in controlling the budget and expenditures, drawn from the first European tax on coal and steel producers. The Community money was spent on re-employment and social housing activities within the sectors concerned. Members were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and a president. The High Authority was obliged to consult the committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. Provisional seats The treaty however made no decision on where to base the institutions of the new community. The treaties allowed for the seat(s) to be decided by common accord of governments yet at a conference of the ECSC members on 23 July 1952 no permanent seat was decided. The seat was contested with Li√®ge, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Turin all considered. While Saarbr√ºcken had a status as a \\"European city\\", the ongoing dispute over Saarland made it a problematic choice. Brussels would have been accepted at the time, but divisions within the then-unstable Belgian government ruled that option out. To break the deadlock, Joseph Bech, then Prime Minister of Luxembourg, proposed that Luxembourg be made the provisional seat of the institutions until a permanent agreement was reached. However, it was decided that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should instead be based in Strasbourg‚Äîthe Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, and they did so until 1999, when a new complex of buildings was built across the river from the Palace.

The Ruhr Area is to be extended to the Dutch border by incorporating parts of the Rhineland, and the whole new territory shall then be detached from Germany. The early French plans were concerned with keeping Germany weak and strengthening the French economy at the expense of that of Germany. (see the Monnet plan) French foreign policy aimed at dismantling German heavy industry, place the coal rich Ruhr area and Rhineland under French control or at a minimum internationalize them, and also to join the coal rich Saarland with the iron rich province of Lorraine (which had been handed over from Germany to France again in 1944).http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/MQ54257.pdf When American diplomats reminded the French of what a devastating effect this would have on the German economy, France's response was to suggest the Germans would just have to \\"make [the] necessary adjustments\\" to deal with the inevitable foreign exchange deficit\\".\\" At the 1945 Potsdam Conference the U.S. was operating under the Morgenthau plan, as a consequence large parts of German industry were to be dismantled.

Others have argued that credit should be given to former U.S. President Herbert Hoover who in one of his reports from Germany, dated 18 March 1947, argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating: :\\"There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'.

The Franco-German conflict over the Saarland was later to prove one of the major hurdles to the integration of the European communities. The Ruhr Agreement was imposed on the Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the Federal Republic of Germany.Amos Yoder, \\"The Ruhr Authority and the German Problem\\", The Review of Politics, Vol. 17, No. 3 (Jul. 1955), pp. 345‚Äì358 By controlling the production and distribution of coal and steel (i.e. how much coal and steel the Germans themselves would get), the International Authority for the Ruhr in effect controlled the entire West German economy, much to the dismay of the Germans. They were however permitted to send their delegations to the authority after the Petersberg agreement. With the West German agreement to join the European Coal and Steel Community in order to lift the restrictions imposed by the IAR, thus also ensuring French security by perpetuating French access to Ruhr coal,France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944‚Äì1954 H-Net Reviews June 2001 the role of the IAR was taken over by the ECSC.All above; Memorandum on the detachment of the German industrial regions (8 September 1945) Note on the advantages of the Franco-Saar Economic Union (August 1952) Documents relating to the Saar-France Issue.

In addition, France maintained a High Commissioner in the Saar with wide-ranging powers. Parties advocating a return of the Saar to Germany were banned, with the consequence that West Germany did not recognise the democratic legality of the Saar government. In view of continued conflict between Germany and France over the future of the Saarland efforts were made by the other Western European nations to find a solution to the potentially dangerous problem. Placed under increasing international pressure, France finally agreed to a compromise. The Saar territory was to be Europeanised under the context of the Western European Union. France and Germany agreed in the Paris Agreements that until a peace treaty was signed with Germany, the Saar area would be governed under a \\"statute\\" that was to be supervised by a European Commissioner who in turn would be responsible to the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union. The Saarland would however have to remain in economic union with France.Yes or No, Time Magazine Monday, 17 October 1955Bverfg No. 7 E 4, 157 1 BvF 1/55 \\"Saar Statute\\" Institute of Global Law, University College London (Google Cach√©) Despite the endorsement of the statute by West Germany, the Saarlanders rejected it in a referendum by a 67.7% majority. Despite French pre-referendum assertions that a no to the statute would simply result in the Saarland remaining in its previous status as a French-controlled territory, the claim of the \\"no\\" campaign group that it would lead to unification with West Germany turned out to be correct. The Saarland was politically reintegrated with West Germany on 1 January 1957, but economic reintegration took many additional years. In return for agreeing to return the Saar France demanded and gained the following concessions: France was permitted to extract coal from the Warndt coal deposit until 1981. Germany had to agree to the channelisation of the Moselle. This reduced French freight costs in the Lorraine steel industry. Germany had to agree to the teaching of French as the first foreign language in schools in the Saarland. Although no longer binding, the agreement is still in the main followed.The issue of the Saar CVCE Development of new Communities The Council of Europe adopted a flag to symbolise Europe Following on the heels of the creation of the ECSC, the European Defence Community (EDC) was drawn up and signed on 27 May 1952. It would combine national armies and allow West Germany to rearm under the control of the new Community. However, in 1954, the treaty was rejected by the French National Assembly.The European Defence Community CVCE The rejection also derailed further plans for a European Political Community, being drawn up by members of the Common Assembly which would have created a federation to ensure democratic control over the future European army.The European Political Community cvce.eu In response to the rejection of the EDC, Jean Monnet resigned as President of the High Authority and began work on new integration efforts in the field of the economy. In 1955, the Council of Europe adopted an emblem for all Europe, twelve golden stars in a circle upon a blue field. It would later be adopted by the European CommunitiesEuropean flag ‚Äì questions and answers CVCE - The symbols of the European Union In 1956, the Egyptian government under Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez canal and closing it to Israeli traffic, sparking the Suez Crisis. This was in response to the withdrawal of funding for the Aswan Dam by the UK and United States due to Egypt's ties to the Soviet Union. The canal was owned by the UK and French investors and had been a neutral zone under British control. The nationalisation and closure to Israeli traffic prompted a military response by the UK, France and Israel, a move opposed by the United States. It was a military success but a political disaster for the UK and France. The UK in particular saw it could not operate alone, instead turning to the US, and it also prompted the next British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, to look towards joining the European Community. Equally France saw its future with the Community but opposed British entry, with then French President Charles de Gaulle stating he would veto British entry out of a fear it would lead to US domination. As a result of the crisis, the Common Assembly proposed extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other sources of energy. However Jean Monnet desired a separate community to cover nuclear power and Louis Armand was put in charge of a study into the prospects of nuclear energy use in Europe. The report concluded further nuclear development was needed to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal deposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. However the Benelux states and Germany were also keen on creating a general common market, although it was opposed by France due to its protectionism and Jean Monnet thought it too large and difficult a task. In the end, Monnet proposed the creating of both, as separate communities, to reconcile both groups.1957‚Äì1968 Successes and crises CVCE - Historical events in the European integration process (1945‚Äì2009) As a result of the Messina Conference of 1955, Paul-Henri Spaak was appointed as chairman of a preparatory committee (Spaak Committee) charged with the preparation of a report on the creation of a common European market. The Spaak Report drawn up by the Spaak Committee provided the basis for further progress and was accepted at the Venice Conference (29 and 30 May 1956) where the decision was taken to organize an Intergovernmental Conference. The report formed the cornerstone of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956. The outcome of the conference was that new communities would share the Common Assembly (now Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as it would with the Court of Justice. However they would not share the ECSC's Council of High Authority. The two new High Authorities would be called Commissions, this was due to a reduction in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers and hence the new Commissions would only have basic powers and important decisions would have to be approved by the Council, which now adopted majority voting. Thus, on 25 March 1957, the Treaties of Rome were signed. They came into force on 1958-01-01 establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The latter body fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the EEC was to create a full customs union between members.

Controversies Allegations of fraud Part of a document sent by Misael L√≥pez Soto to his superiors regarding irregularities at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq. On 8 February 2017, a joint CNN and CNN en Espa√±ol investigation called \\"Passports in the Shadows\\" () - based on the information provided by a whistleblower and subsequent investigations, reported that employees of the Venezuelan embassy in Baghdad, Iraq has been selling passports and visas to persons from Middle Eastern countries (specifically Syria, Palestine, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan) with dubious backgrounds for profits, including to members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah. The Venezuelan immigration department, SAIME, confirmed the sold passports' genuineness as each passport came with an assigned national identification number, although the names of these individuals were altered when checking against the national database. At least one individual's place of birth was also changed from Iraq to Venezuela. According to Misael L√≥pez Soto, a former employee at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq who was also a lawyer and CICPC officer, the Bolivarian government would sell authentic passports to individuals from the Middle East, with the Venezuelan passport able to access 130 countries throughout the world without a visa requirement. L√≥pez provided CNN documents showing how his superiors attempted to cover up the sale of passports, which were being sold from $5,000 to $15,000 per passport. L√≥pez Soto fled the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq in 2015 to meet with the FBI in Spain, with a Venezuelan official who assisted him to fly out of the country being killed the same day. The investigation also found that between 2008 and 2012, Tareck El Aissami ordered for hundreds of Middle Eastern individuals to obtain illegal passports, including members of Hezbollah. The Venezuelan foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez, denied the government's involvement when questioned by the reporters during the Seventy- first session of the United Nations General Assembly and accused the network of performing what she described as an \\"imperialistic media operation\\" against Venezuela for airing the year-long fraud investigation.Venezuela may have given passports to people with ties to terrorism On 14 February 2017, Venezuelan authorities ceased the broadcasting of CNN en Espa√±ol two days after the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, ordered CNN to \\"(get) well away from here\\".Venezuelan president says he wants CNN out of country just days after report on passports, visas being sold in IraqVenezuela bans CNN after report alleges Iraq passport fraud The government deemed the report \\"(A threat to) the peace and democratic stability of our Venezuelan people since they generate an environment of intolerance.\\" In addition, CNN en Espa√±ol has been also accused of instigating religious, racial and political hatred, violence and other themes, according to the Venezuelan National Commission of Telecommunications director Andres Eloy Mendez.http://www.trtworld.com/americas/venezuela-pulls-cnn-for-distorting- truth-298639http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/15/americas/cnn-en-espanol- venezuela-off-air/ Material shortages In March 2017, it was reported that SAIME lacks enough \\"materials\\" to cope with demands for passports.

In 1967 the EEC's institutions took over the other two with the EEC's Commission holding its first terms under Hallstein and Rey.Each European Commission since 1958 EU AVS In 1958 the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) was established.

De Gaulle and EFTA In 1960, the \\"outer seven\\" (Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) established the European Free Trade Association in Stockholm, which entered into force on 3 May of that year. In the following two years, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and Norway applied for membership of the Communities, while the neutral countries Austria, Sweden and Switzerland asked for economic association agreements. Membership application was suspended due to opposition from then-French President Charles de Gaulle to British membership, seeing it as a Trojan horse for US influence.BBC on this day, November 27th news.bbc.co.uk Another crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority- voting in the council had taken effect. De Gaulle's opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an \\"empty chair policy\\" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.Fifty years of fraternal rivalry news.bbc.co.uk 19 March 2007The 'empty chair' policy CVCE.eu Merger Treaty On 24 September 1963 the members reached an agreement on merging the executive bodies of the three Communities.

On 1 January 1973, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom became the first countries to join the Communities. The newly enlarged Ortoli Commission took office under Fran√ßois- Xavier Ortoli on 5 January. The first Commission to be led by a member from the new states was the Jenkins Commission, of the UK's Roy Jenkins who held office between 1977 and 1981. Following on was the Thorn Commission, which oversaw the completion of the customs union and then 1985 saw the first Delors Commission. First elections Simone Veil, elected the first female President of Parliament The Treaties of Rome had stated that the European Parliament must be directly elected, however this required the Council to agree on a common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed, French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted Budgetary powers following his resignation. Parliament pressured for agreement and on 20 September 1976 the Council agreed part of the necessary instruments for election, deferring details on electoral systems which remain varied to this day. During the tenure of President Jenkins, in June 1979, the elections were held in all the then-members. 410 MEPs were elected and at their first meeting they elected a new President of the European Parliament; Simone Veil, a French liberal who was the first woman to be elected to the post. The new Parliament, galvanised by direct election and new powers, started working full-time and became more active than the previous assemblies. The elections also helped cement the political groups and, despite attempts by the larger groups to consolidate their position, smaller parties began to co-operate and form alliances. In the subsequent elections (1984 and 1989) the electorate expanded to include new member states and the left wing parties saw increasing electoral gains. However, turnout began to drop from 63% in 1979 to 58% in 1989. Further enlargement The Communities alongside the European Free Trade Association and Comecon during the Cold War.

The draft treaty establishing a European Union, which was inspired by the failed European Political Community, was adopted by the Parliament 237 votes to 31 (43 abstentions).

He was the first Jamaican to play professional football in England. Between 1948 and 1960, he played league football for Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Mansfield Town. Playing career Lindy Delapenha started playing competitive football at the age of 11 when he played for Wolmer's Schools. He scored his first goal for Wolmer's against St. George's College, Jamaica in the Manning Cup competition. Delapenha then attended Munro College in Jamaica where he was a multi-sport athlete. As a schoolboy, Delapenha took part in 16 events over a one-and-a-half-day period in England. He then served with the British Armed Forces in the Middle East following World War II. During his service, an English football scout saw him playing football for the British Army. This gained him a trial with Arsenal, but he did not sign for the club, and in April 1948 he joined Portsmouth. There, he became the first Jamaican to play professional football in England. Although it is claimed he was the first non-white player to appear in the English Football League First Division, he was actually predated by several other non-white players, including Arthur Wharton, who played a First Division match for Sheffield United as far back as 1894‚Äì95. In April 1950, after a successful few years with Portsmouth, he transferred to Middlesbrough where his career took off. He played on the wing or inside-forward, and became Boro's leading scorer in the 1951‚Äì52, 1953‚Äì54 and 1955‚Äì56 seasons. In total he scored 93 league and FA Cup goals in 270 appearances. He moved to Mansfield Town in June 1958, contributing 27 goals in 115 appearances over two years, before retiring from League football in 1960. Delapenha played non-league football, Hereford United and Burton Albion. He won the Southern League Cup in 1964 with Burton. Later life Having returned home to Jamaica in 1964, Delapenha played cricket for a short time and represented Boys' Town at football, taking them from Division 3 up to Division 1. He also coached his alma mater, Wolmer's Schools in athletics and football in the mid 1960s. Soon after, he became director of sports at the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation. At the JBC, he had various roles including co-ordinating coverage of cricket, the Commonwealth Games, and helped bring international football to Jamaica. He stayed there for 30 years before JBC was sold and his services were no longer required. He died on 26 January 2017 at the age of 89, after a stroke.Lindy Delapenha is dead. Jamaica Observer.

It was established on April 27, 1977 by a small group of people near the town of Leiden. It grew to become a nationally significant club of over 200,000 members in 2003. History The HCC was inspired by the Amateur Computer Club founded in 1973 by Mike Lord. Dick Barnhoorn became a member of the ACC and after a few years started the HCC in the Netherlands and Belgium (for Dutch/Flemish speakers). In the beginning letters were sent to popular electronics and IT magazines. The initial logo of HCC was an adapted copy of the ACC logo. The first HCC meeting was in a building of the Delft University of Technology, at that moment the HCC had 12 members. A small stenciled, A5 size, newsletter was published bimonthly called HCCN (HCC Nieuwsbrief) similar to ACCN (ACC Newsletter). After participating in a large event for technical hobbies in April 1978 membership increased from 200 to over 1000. Soon the HCC had branches in every part of the Netherlands, and through the years the HCC grew to more than 200,000 members. The small newsletter turned into a monthly computer magazine called Computer!Totaal. The HCC now also offers a free Internet service to its members, as well as free technical assistance with computer problems. For many decades a big exhibition called the \\"HCC dagen\\" (HCC Days) was held in Jaarbeurs in Utrecht with thousands of attendees. A tradition started in 1977, for showing off the member's activities and giving commercial parties an opportunity to demonstrate new products and sell equipment and software. It was interrupted in 2010 because the commercial parties lost interest as internet was becoming their main sales platform. In 2011 HCC organised a similar event on a much smaller scale than before, HCC!digital.

Because of its location, the building is a prominent feature of the London skyline despite being only 11 storeys high. The Faraday Building was the GPO's first telephone exchange in London, and still used by BT Group. The building fronts onto Queen Victoria Street and backs onto Knightrider Street. It started life as 'Central' telephone exchange at the Post Office Savings Bank building in Queen Victoria Street, opening for business on 1 March 1902 with just 200 subscribers. The present building, originally known as Faraday House, was designed by the architect A. R. Myers for the Office of Works and completed in 1933.Simon Bradley (ed.), Nikolaus Pevsner, London. 1. The City of London (London: Penguin Books, 1997) p. 343. It was erected on the former site of Doctors' Commons, which had been the location of the Admiralty Court, Probate Court, and the principal ecclesiastical court in England. The Post Office‚Äôs first London telephone exchange served nearly of the capital ‚Äì notable subscribers included the Treasury, the War Office and Fleet Street. Take-up of the telephone by the public was very quick so that by 1905 the exchange capacity was extended to 10,000 subscribers, and full capacity was exhausted just three years later. To meet the growing demand from businesses in the City, a new common battery exchange was installed in 1906 with a capacity of 15,000 lines. This became 'City' exchange and officially opened in November 1907. In common with other exchanges in London, Central was able to connect subscribers to the Electrophone exchange at Gerard Street. Electrophone allowed people to listen to performances at certain London theatres and music halls while sitting at home. In 1933, the international telephone exchange was opened at Faraday. In 1935, an automatic exchange was opened with more than 6,000 working lines. The complex task of switching subscribers over to the new exchange involved 60 engineers working for more than 15 months. The building's entrance The construction of the Faraday Building obscured the riverside view of St Paul's Cathedral. This led directly to regulations protecting views of St Paul's from a number of vantage points by restricting the height of new buildings constructed in certain designated areas.John Schofield, St Paul's Cathedral: Archaeology and History (London and Philadelphia: Oxbow, 2016) pp. 110‚Äì111. The City of London School and another telephone exchange, Baynard House, were built between the riverside and Faraday Building but are restricted in height to just three levels above ground.

It had a population of 2,733 at the 2010 Census. Its ZIP code is 15044. Geography Gibsonia is located in the central and southwest parts of Richland Township, and it is north of downtown Pittsburgh. The CDP's elevation is above sea level. Gibsonia appears on the Valencia U.S. Geological Survey Map. The area is in the Eastern time zone (GMT -5). History Gibsonia was named in honor of the Gibson family who settled the area; their original house was demolished in December 2019. The early history of Gibsonia is, naturally enough, interwoven with the history of the Gibson family. About the time of the Civil War, Charles Gibson, Jr., built the first steam flour mill west of the Alleghenies on Grubbs Road. His granddaughter, Nancy Gibson James, recalls hearing her uncle tell of the farmers riding to the mill with sacks of grain across the saddles. The Gibson family homestead was built by her grandfather, Charles Gibson, Jr., in 1839. Just below the former site of the home, near the railroad crossing, still remains the foundation of Charles Gibson's general store. This building, destroyed by fire in 1908, besides housing the store was also the first post office in Gibsonia. For about ten years before it burned it was in use as a mission of the Christian & Missionary Alliance Church. The village was linked to Pittsburgh and Butler by the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway in 1907. The line closed in 1931, services being replaced by buses along Route 8. It is the home of the Western Pennsylvania Model Railroad Museum. Education The area around Gibsonia is mainly located in the Pine-Richland School District,Pine- Richland School District, Nov,1-2010 as well as the Hampton Township School District,Hampton Township School District, Oct-29,-2010 North Allegheny School District, Deer Lakes School District, and a small portion of the Mars Area School District. According to Greatschools.com, Pine-Richland School District ranks 10/10, Hampton Township School District ranks 10/10, Deer Lakes School District ranks 7/10, and Mars Area School District ranks 9/10 based on academic performance on state tests. The Aquinas Academy of Pittsburgh is located south of Gibsonia in Hampton Township. It is a private school serving pre-K through Grade 12. Gibsonia is also the site of Chatham University's Eden Hall campus, which is used for various environmental studies, and as a community college for Gibsonia. Amenities Gibsonia is home to many offerings for local shoppers. The Richland Mall is located on Route 8. Shops located in this mall are Shop 'n Save, Kohl's, T.J.

Following numerous departures, the band went from being a four- piece to a trio, featuring Henry Tremain on bass and lead vocals, Tim Collis on guitar and his brother Chris Collis on drums. Their debut full-length album, Animals, was released in the UK via Big Scary Monsters Recording Company in October of 2008 and shortly after in the US via Sargent House Records.Solomon, Blake (12 October 2008). \\"This Town Needs Guns ‚Äì Interview\\", AbsolutePunk. Retrieved on 2009-09-28. They have released four studio albums, as well as numerous EPs and singles. History The band formed in 2004 in Oxford. The original lineup consisted of Stuart Smith on rhythm guitar and vocals, Tim Collis on lead guitar, Simon Thompson on drums and Ian Lewis on bass. Thompson and Lewis left the band in 2005, to be replaced by Dan Adams on bass (replaced by Jamie Cooper after the recording of Animals in 2008) and Matt Bennington on drums (replaced by Chris Collis, brother of guitarist Tim, in 2006). In their earlier careers, bassist Jamie Cooper had worked as a graphic designer, drummer Chris Collis had been a librarian at the University of Oxford, guitarist Tim Collis was a primary school teacher, and lead vocalist Stuart Smith worked building websites for a publisher. On 11 May 2011, it was announced on This Town Needs Guns' website that lead singer Stuart Smith would be leaving the band to start a family, and that he would be replaced by Pennines' singer and guitarist Henry Tremain. Bassist Jamie Cooper also left the band in late 2011 to focus on a career in graphic design. Tremain has since taken over on bass guitar duties, converting the band into a power trio. On 14 September 2012, the first track from the second album 13.0.0.0.0, entitled \\"Cat Fantastic\\" was released on digital streaming platforms. The album was released on 22 January 2013. Their third album, Disappointment Island, was released in July 2016. In 2017, the whole band was arrested in Hong Kong during an immigration raid on the final show of their tour. In July 2018, the band announced a 10-year anniversary tour of Animals, in which Smith would be returning to the band to play with them for the first time in seven years. In October of that year, an acoustic version of the album entitled Animals Acoustic was released.  Musical style and influences  Over the years the band's musical style has progressed and changed, although the focal point of their style has been the guitar work of Tim Collis interspersed with, at points, highly complex drumming and sparse, melodic bass. Early releases however, featured more distorted chord progressions, as well as a strong focus on the interlinking melodies of both Collis and Smith's guitars. More recently however, the band's music has become more technical; making more use of asymmetrical time signatures and complex accenting between guitar and drums, plus an abandonment of distortion and guitar effects, giving way to more complex melodies. The Sydney Morning Herald describes the band's music as having \\"intricate pop guitar work, with a touch of jazz and Spanish influences\\".Hassett, Sebastian (25 July 2009). \\"Pass the sugar\\", The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved on 2009-09-28. The band is considered to be part of the genre of math rock. The band cites influences of other bands such as Owls, American Football and Make Believe.Yates, Ben (September 2008). \\"DiScover: This Town Needs Guns\\", Drowned in Sound. Retrieved on 2008-12-27.  Name change  With the release of 13.0.0.0.0 the band announced that they would be calling themselves TTNG. They stated that the name was ironic because guns are hardly present in their hometown of Oxford, and the UK in general. Now that the band is more known around the world, the name is no longer clearly ironic.

Dutton's work took place in South Africa as well as abroad. In South Africa, he helped expose the apartheid military's destabilization machinery, and later headed the Scorpions, the country's elite police force. He also worked with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Nelson Mandela personally thanked him for his service.

It began to manufacture wristwatches in order to create work in the Waldenburg valley whose location at the route Basel-Geneva had become insignificant due to the newly established train connection Basel - Olten - Geneva. In 1859 G√©d√©on Thommen and Louis Tschopp acquires the company and privately restructured it. G√©d√©on Thommen is also the founder and promoter of the Waldenburgerbahn, a steam train connecting the valley‚Äôs villages. Tschopp left the company, which was renamed G√©d√©on Thommen‚Äôs Uhrenfabriken. From 1905, the company was commercially registered as REVUE THOMMEN AG, a joint-stock company. REVUE had been used earlier as a brand name of the company‚Äôs wrist watches, after they had been marketed as ‚ÄúGT‚Äù watches (GT standing for G√©d√©on Thommen) before. In 1916, the first aircraft chronograph for the Swiss Air Force was created and laid the foundation for the company‚Äôs success as an aircraft instrument supplier. From 1936 ‚Äì 1943, the company produced cockpit instrumentation for the Swiss Air Force. REVUE THOMMEN developed and supplied altimeters, airspeed indicators, vertical speed indicators, clocks, and the landing gear for the Swiss multifunction biplane EKW C-35. In 1945 REVUE THOMMEN commercialized its technical capabilities in the aviation sector by launching a pocket altimeter for alpinists. Derivations like altimeters for parachutists will follow and are produced well into the Internet age. Recent history  In 2000 REVUE THOMMEN AG granted a license to the Swiss company Grovana Ltd. for the manufacturing and marketing of the REVUE THOMMEN wrist watch brand products, so REVUE THOMMEN AG can focus on its aircraft instrument business. After the wrist watch business was spun off, the company began expanding its mechanical cockpit instrument business through the introduction of electronic aircraft equipment, including air data systems and helicopter searchlights. In 2012 ‚ÄùGT Thommen Watch AG‚Äù, the joint-venture partnership of Andreas Thommen, Roland Buser and Christopher Bitterli, bought the intellectual property rights for the watch business from REVUE THOMMEN AG and began revitalizing the brand in the Swiss wrist watch business. They appointed Swiss Initiative Limited (SIL) as sole license holder for the production and worldwide distribution in 2015. Now being solely an aviation industry supplier, REVUE THOMMEN was acquired by TRANSAS Group in 2012, a Russian technology company, which handed over its shares to the Russian private investor Sistema on October 4, 2015. The decline of demand for mechanical aircraft instruments in the aviation industry and economical pressure also led REVUE THOMMEN AG to restructure. REVUE, the former brand name of wrist watches, was removed from the company name in order to clearly identify the company as supplier to the aviation industry. In 2015 it was rebranded as THOMMEN AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT AG, and it sold its mechanical aircraft instrument business to SATHOM, a subsidiary of the French aircraft component MRO company SATORI Sarl, in June 2016. SATHOM stays at the original location of REVUE THOMMEN and was granted a license to continue the production and sale of mechanical aircraft instruments under the THOMMEN brand name. In 2016, THOMMEN AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT moved from Waldenburg to a modern location in Muttenz, Switzerland, closer to Basel, where it focuses on development of electronic aircraft clocks, air data systems and helicopter searchlights, cabin/emergency flashlights.

Subjects offered include ethics, public policy development and analysis, organizational development, public finance, and sustainable development. In keeping with the University's Jesuit tradition, a Spirituality course is also included in the curriculum. Short training programs which are task-oriented and skill-specific are also available. These continuing education and executive classes can be customized to suit the needs of organizations. Program design and delivery The MPM makes use of actual cases and practical exercises in concentrated and accelerated modular schedules. ASoG courses are taught through adult learning techniques that build on the student's experience. These techniques include active discussions in class, the use of problem-based case studies, simulations and lectures. Each academic subject is delivered through four-hour sessions per week for eight consecutive weeks. The MPM is composed of forty- five units. Each three-unit course is composed of eight classes usually held every Saturday. Each class generally runs for four hours in duration. Part- time MPM requires approximately two-and-a-half years to complete. However, under the MPM accelerated option, a student can take six academic units per module. The PhD in Leadership Studies program follows a similar mode of delivery, but with added research options. An option to choose between quantitative research and public policy implementation research is given, with a particular emphasis on local governance.

He was born in Szczakowa, then part of the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (since 1918 Poland). His family was of assimilated German descent in Polish for generations. He died in Warsaw. Initially a student of chemistry, Stieber turned his attention to comparative Slavic linguistics at the University of Krak√≥w in 1926. His interest in the dialects of border areas led him to the study of East Slovak and Ukrainian dialects, where his work focused on toponyms, their etymology, and the history and settlement of the places where they are attested. He also carried out research on Sorbian and Belarusian, and was involved in producing linguistic atlases of Kashubian (1964‚Äì78), Polish (Nitsch 1957-70), and Lemkian (1956‚Äì64). Particularly valuable was his introduction of colors and symbols to dialect maps. Stieber's work in the 1930s represented some of the first studies of the dialect of the Lemko Rusyns. The deportation of this ethnic group in Operation Vistula after World War II underlines the importance of Stieber's work carried out while the community was still intact. Stieber also produced works on the history and development of Polish (1934), Czech (1957), and Slavic in general (1969). Stieber held teaching appointments in Krak√≥w, Lviv, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and Warsaw. His work in Polish and Slavic philology had a particularly strong influence on the introduction of the structural method in the teaching of phonology at the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫.:: Uniwersytet ≈Åodzki - Filologia Polska :: The Nitsch- Trnka-Stieber Law (stating that phonemic contrasts in a language can only be produced by regular sound laws or borrowing, but not as a result of analogical changes in morphophonemic rules) remains a matter of debate today (cf.

He is best known for the films he made with his third wife Anna Neagle. Early life Wilcox's mother was from County Cork, Ireland, and Wilcox considered himself Irish, but he was born in Norwood, south London.7 Dagmar Villas, Gipsy Road. Mr Michael Thornton re Mr Herbert Wilcox. The Times, Thursday, 19 May 1977; p. 18; Issue 60007; col F His family moved to Brighton when Wilcox was eight years old; he was one of five children. His family were poor and Wilcox had to do a number of part-time jobs, including some work as a chorus boy at the local Hippodrome. His mother died of tuberculosis when she was 42. Wilcox left school before the age of fourteen to find work. Shortly afterwards, his father died at the age of 42. Wilcox began earning money as a professional pool player at the Metropole in Camberwell Green. The First World War broke out and Wilcox enlisted in the army. He was training cadets in County Cork when the Easter Rising broke out in 1916 and Wilcox was wounded.Wilcox p 3, 30-32 He then enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps to earn more money and trained as a pilot. A case of appendicitis kept him away from the front for a time but he wound up serving in France and serving as a flight instructor in England.Wilcox p 40-46 Film career After the war, Wilcox went to work for his brother Charles as a film salesman. He began selling American films to Yorkshire exhibitors, occasionally working with Victor Saville. Astra Films In 1919, Wilcox used his war gratuity to found his own distribution company, Astra Films, in association with his brother and a colleague, Jack Smart. Wilcox contributed ¬£117, and the others made up the rest. It was based in Yorkshire. \\"Owing to the war, there were practically no British productions\\", said Wilcox. \\"They were almost all American films.\\"Wilcox p 48 The company was immediately successful so they expanded into London. Graham-Wilcox Productions Astra had a lot of success with a British film, A Peep Behind the Scenes (1919) so Wilcox decided to produce a British film himself. He raised ¬£1,400 to make The Wonderful Story (1922). It was directed by a Newcastle exhibitor who shared Wilcox's enthusiasm for D. W. Griffith, Jack Graham Cutts; he and Wilcox established Graham-Wilcox Productions. Wilcox sold the film for ¬£4,000 and the premiere got excellent reviews. This enabled Wilcox to raise funds for a slate of films, before The Wonderful Story was released and flopped at the box office.Wilcox p 51Obituary. Mr Herbert Wilcox Pioneer British film maker The Times, Monday, 16 May 1977; pg. 16; Issue 60004; col F However the next Graham-Wilcox production, Flames of Passion (1922), starring imported Hollywood star Mae Marsh was a big hit, among the first British films sold to the USA. The success of the film inspired Wilcox to steer away from realistic drama and focus on escapist entertainment. Director Wilcox optioned the screen rights for Chu-Chin-Chow (1923), with imported American star Betty Blythe. The film was shot in Germany at UFA's studios in association with Eric Pommer with a huge budget but was only a moderate success.Wilcox p 55 He followed it with Southern Love (1924), shot in Vienna, again with Blythe. Wilcox launched the film with a mock bull fight in Albert Hall and says the film returned a profit in England alone.Wilcox p 58 Pommer asked Wilcox to collaborate again and they made Decameron Nights (1924). Back in Britain he made Paddy the Next Best Thing (1923). After what he described as a \\"series of unimpressive films\\" he made The Only Way (1926), based on a stage play which was based on A Tale of Two Cities.Wilcox p 62 He followed it with Nell Gwyn (1926), starring Dorothy Gish in the title role. This was a big success around the world. British National Films The world rights to Nell Gwyn were purchased by British National Films, a company established by J.D. Williams, who signed Wilcox and Gish to make three more films, all financed by Paramount: Madame Pompadour (1926), the first film shot at the newly built Elstree Studios; London (1926); and Tip Toes (1927). It was later revealed in a court case that Wilcox's fee was ¬£3,000 a film plus 25% of the profits, but there were no profits for the three films. British and Dominions Film Corporation Wilcox ended up leaving British National and founded the British and Dominions Film Corporation with Nelson Keys with capital of half a million pounds. HIs first film for them, via Herbert Wilcox Productions, was Mumsie (1927), starring Pauline Frederick and, in his debut, Herbert Marshall. Wilcox wanted to make another film with Frederick and suggested No√´l Coward's The Vortex but Frederick disliked the role. Wilcox instead decided to do a version of the Edith Cavell story, Dawn (1928). Frederick dropped out of the film, and was replaced by Sybil Thorndike. Filming proved difficult but the resulting movie was a big hit. In 1928 British and Dominion Films insured Wilcox for ¬£100,000. There was some talk he would make a film of the Burke and Wills story. Instead he made what he described as \\"a series of unimportant but profitable films\\":Wilcox p 83 The Bondman (1929), The Woman in White (1929), Sound Films Generally, Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is regarded as the first film with sound, but Wilcox's Black Waters was trade-shown several weeks earlier in May, 1929. He produced more than a hundred films, of which he directed about half. \\"His film production team were never laid off, even during the worst depressions of the British film industry. They were on full salary 52 weeks of the year.\\" Wilcox built and equipped sound studios next to the British International Pictures studios, which they bought from John Maxwell. Wilcox signed up top stage artists such as Jack Buchanan, Tom Walls and Ralph Lynn and Sydney Howard, with C.B. Cochran and Albert de Courville as producers. He announced plans to make nine talkies. He produced and directed the first British all talkie ever made, Wolves (1930), with Charles Laughton and Dorothy Gish and produced Canaries Sometimes Sing (1930). He made an arrangement to produce a series of films in association with His Master's Voice gramophone company, with the aim of using their celebrity recording stars. Among the films they were to make together were Cochran's Talkie Revue, a film of C.B Cochran's variety show; the play Rookery Nook; an adaptation of the novel The Blue Lagoon, and the life story of Robert Burns. However their first movie, The Loves of Robert Burns (1930), with Joseph Hislop, was not a success and the arrangement abruptly ended. Wilcox's plans to make The Life of Beethoven and a version of Don Quixote starring Chaliapin had to be cancelled.Wilcox p 86-87 Wilcox produced Rookery Nook (1930), an Aldwych farce based on the play by Ben Travers and directed by Tom Walls. It led to a series of Aldwych farces from Travers and Walls. He acted as producer only on Splinters (1930), high Treason (1930, The Mountain of Mourne (1930), Warned Off (1930), On Approval (1930), Tons of Money (1930), Mischief (1931), The Speckled Band (1931), Plunder (1931), Almost a Divorce (1931), Up for the Cup (1931) with Sydney Howard, The Barton Mystery (1932), Life Goes On (1932), Thark (1932), Leap Year (1932), It's a King (1932),The Love Contract (1932), Say It with Music(1932), The Mayor's Nest (1932), and A Night Like This (1932). As a director he made The Chance of a Night Time (1931) with Ralph Lynn from a play by Ben Travers; Carnival (1931); and The Blue Danube (1933). Anna Neagle Wilcox's professional relationship with Anna Neagle began when he was looking for a leading lady to support Jack Buchanan in Goodnight, Vienna (1932). He decided to cast her after seeing Neagle support Buchanan on stage in a musical Stand Up and Cheer. Goodnight Vienna was Wilcox's biggest success to that time.Wilcox p 91 He used Neagle again in The Flag Lieutenant (1932) He made some films without her ‚Äì Money Means Nothing (1932), The King's Cup (1933), General John Regan (1933), The Blarney Stone (1933), The King of Paris (1933), Lord of the Manor (1933), Discord (1933) ‚Äì then they were reunited on The Little Damozel (1933), a conscious effort on Wilcox's part to ensure that Neagle was not type cast as an \\"English Rose\\".Wilcox p 98 He bought the rights to a John Galsworthy play Loyalties and developed a screenplay. He later sold it to William Fox for a profit.Wilcox p 95-97 He produced That's a Good Girl (1933). Bitter Sweet (1933) starred Neagle, based on the operetta by No√´l Coward. It was a box office failure.Wilcox p 97 Yes, Mr Brown (1933) was a vehicle for Jack Buchanan and Lilies of the Field (1934) without her. Wilcox was back to Neagle for The Queen's Affair (1934). He and Neagle had a big hit with a new version of Nell Gwynn (1934). They followed it with Peg of Old Drury (1935). He also produced Escape Me Never (1935), starring Elisabeth Bergner, which was a surprise box office hit.Wilcox p 93 Herbert Wilcox Productions The success of Peg of Old Drury saw Wilcox approached by Lord Portal to set up his own company, Herbert Wilcox Productions. Wilcox resigned from British Dominion, and set up the new company with C.M. Woolf and J. Arthur Rank. The only other shareholders in the company apart from Wilcox were Woolf and his brother Maurice. Wilcox, Woolf, Portal and Rank soon established themselves as a major player in the industry by buying Universal Pictures' English operations; Wilcox was appointed to the board to directors of Universal English and the Universal American parent company. He also had shares in a new company, General Cinema Finance, which was to control the distribution and production of films and acquire cinemas. This company would go on to acquire Gaumont British and the Odeon circuit and form the back bone of the Rank Film empire.Wilcox p 104-108 Their first film was Street Singer Serenade (1936), aka Limelight, directed by Wilcox with Neagle and Jack Buchanan. It was followed by Fame (1936), which he produced, starring Sydney Howard and new Wilcox discovers Miki Hood and Geraldine Hislop. He and Neagle did a story about trapeze artists, Three Maxims (1936). He made Where's George? (1936) with Sydney Howard. Wilcox was back with Buchanan with This'll Make You Whistle (1936). He wanted to make a version of The Blue Lagoon with Hollywood stars and a biopic of Lady Hamilton with Neagle but neither was made.Wise, James E., Jr. and Anne Collier Rehill. Stars in Blue. Naval Institute Press, 1997, p. 201. . Instead he made Millions (1937). Wilcox's film studio at Elstree burnt down and Wilcox moved to new studios at Pinewood. There he made London Melody (1937) with Neagle. RKO Wilcox wanted to star Neagle in a biopic of Queen Victoria. Woolf refused to finance it, believing it to be a bad investment, so Wilcox raised the bulk of the finance himself. Wilcox invested his entire savings and Neagle put in ¬£10,000. They secured a distribution agreement with RKO. Victoria the Great (1937) was a massive success and led to Wilcox signing a ten-year deal with RKO to help finance and distribute the films. He and Neagle promptly made a sequel, Sixty Glorious Years (1938). Wilcox produced but did not direct A Royal Divorce (1938) starring Ruth Chatterton. Wilcox announced he would make a biopic of Lord KitchenerNEW HERBERT WILCOX FILM. (1939, Jan 31).

They looked into making a biopic of Marie Lloyd but could not find a suitable co-star for Neagle so instead made another biopic, Nurse Edith Cavell (1939). They were going to follow it with a biopic of Flora MacDonald filmed in Scotland but the declaration of war made that impossible.A JACOBITE FILM. (1939, Jul 08). The Scotsman (1921‚Äì1950) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/490183757 Instead they made three musicals: Irene (1940), with Ray Milland; No, No, Nanette (1940), with Victor Mature; and Sunny (1941) with Ray Bolger. They were among the many names who worked on Forever and a Day (1943). In July 1941 Wilcox and Neagle returned to England to make They Flew Alone (1942) a biopic of Amy Johnson and the war thriller Yellow Canary (1943). The London Films Wilcox and Neagle had a big hit with I Live in Grosvenor Square (1945), co starring Rex Harrison and Dean Jagger. They followed it with Piccadilly Incident (1946), starring Neagle and Michael Wilding, which was even more popular, the second biggest British hit of 1946. Wilcox signed Wilding to a long term contract. The Courtneys of Curzon Street (1947) was the most popular film at the British box office in 1947. Another hit was Spring in Park Lane (1948). Wilding was not in their next film, Elizabeth of Ladymead (1948) but returned for Maytime in Mayfair (1949), a sequel to Spring in Park Lane, and another massive success. Wilcox and Neagle returned to war stories with Odette (1950) a biopic of Odette Samson starring Neagle and Trevor Howard, and Wilcox's most profitable movie to date. He planned to make a biopic about Van Gogh starring Trevor Howard, but it was never made.Harper & Porter p.156 Wilcox made a film without Neagle, Into the Blue (1950), with Wilding and Odile Versois; it was not particularly popular. Neagle and Wilding were reunited for The Lady with a Lamp (1951), a biopic of Florence Nightingale and Derby Day (1952), an ensemble film. Both did well at the box office but not as well as the late 40s films. Margaret Lockwood and Republic Pictures In the early 1950s Neagle had a long running stage hit, The Glorious Years. In November 1951 Wilcox signed a multi picture deal with Margaret Lockwood to make six films in three years. The following year he signed a six-picture deal with Republic Films. The first movie Lockwood-Wilcox film, Trent's Last Case (1952) was a solid success, helped by a cast including Wilding and Orson Welles. However Laughing Anne (1953), co- starring Forrest Tucker and Wendell Corey, and Trouble in the Glen (1954), with Welles, did poorly and he made no further films with Lockwood or Republic. Wilcox was further hurt when a film he produced, The Beggar's Opera (1953), was a box office disaster. Errol Flynn and Ivor Novello Wilcox formed a new production company, Everest, and made two musicals with Neagle and Errol Flynn: Lilacs in the Spring (1954), based on The Glorious Years, and King's Rhapsody (1955), based on a musical by Ivor Novello. Both flopped and plans to make a third Novello film, Perchance to Dream did not happen. Last films Wilcox had a hit with My Teenage Daughter (1956), a story of Neagle dealing with a juvenile delinquent daughter played by Sylvia Syms. Less successful was These Dangerous Years (1957), produced by Neagle and directed by Wilcox, starring George Baker and Frankie Vaughan, and no Neagle. He produced but did not direct a war film, Yangtse Incident (1957), which performed reasonably well at the British box office but ultimately lost money. Wilcox found himself personally liable for some of the film's costs. He tried a drama with Neagle, The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1958), and three films with Vaughan: Wonderful Things! (1958), The Heart of a Man (1959), and The Lady Is a Square (1959). Bankruptcy Wilcox was plagued with financial troubles in the 1950s and 1960s. He missed an early opportunity to invest in television; Anna Neagle's chain of dancing schools failed; he and Neagle invested heavily in British Lion shares and the company went into receivership; he borrowed ¬£341,000 from the Edgware Trust; he and Neagle had guaranteed a ¬£75,000 loan to make the two Errol Flynn films; and he paid ¬£100,000 to Terence Rattigan for the film rights to his play Ross only for him to be unable to get it made. His film company failed in the 1960s. He spent two years trying to make a film about King Edward VII but the Queen refused permission. He was declared bankrupt in 1964, owing ¬£16,000 to the Edgware Trust and ¬£134,313 over all.Herbert wilcox in bankruptcy court. (1964, Jan 29). The Guardian (1959‚Äì2003) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/184909876 However, the musical play Charlie Girl, starring his wife Anna Neagle, ran for five years and resolved this financial situation.

At the time, Herbert Wilcox was a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps. His wife was \\"carrying on a disgraceful intrigue\\" with an also-married Mr. Stanley Steel. The jury awarded Wilcox damages, possibly shared with Mrs Steel, of ¬£750 plus costs.News of the World 24 June 1917, p. 3 (n.b. the News of the World was a weekly, published on Sundays.) In 1920, Wilcox married Maude Bower; they had four children together. Wilcox married his third wife, actress Anna Neagle, on August 9, 1943. The couple remained married until Wilcox's death in 1977, but they had no children. Prior to his death at the age of 87 in London, England after a long illness, Wilcox donated four Daily Mail National Film Awards to the Glebelands Retirement Home in Wokingham. Wilcox is buried in the City of London Cemetery.London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer, by Hugh Meller & Brian Parsons Awards In 1937, the Wilcox film Victoria the Great was nominated for the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival, but lost out to the French film Life Dances On (Un carnet de bal).

Organisation The website was first launched in 2000 by Lisbeth Kirk, a Danish journalist. There is much academic debate over whether EUobserver, along with other similar publications, can be considered to be contributing to the creation of a pan-European public sphere.

In 2019, Koert Debeuf was appointed as new editor-in-chief of EUobserver. Readership The newspaper claims both financial independence from EU institutions and a daily circulation of 60,000. In a 2008 poll of 100 Brussels-based journalists by APCO, one third claimed to use the publication as their source for EU news, making it, at the time, the \\"second most influential\\" media outlet reporting on EU affairs behind the Financial Times. Also, in a 2016 media survey, conducted by ComRes and Burson- Marsteller on ‚ÄòWhat Influences the Influencers‚Äô, it was found that EUobserver tended to be the preferred source of news for EU officials.

Following a brief fling with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), Jase begins a more serious relationship with Dawn Swann (Kara Tointon), whom he later proposes to. He unknowingly begins working for May Wright (Amanda Drew), the woman who had planned to adopt Dawn's daughter, Summer. A violent confrontation occurs when May tries again to abscond with Summer and causes a gas explosion in Dawn's house; Jase saves Summer's life, catching her when she is dropped from a first floor window. With their house burnt down and no money, Dawn begins to fret over their financial future. Wanting to please Dawn, Jase takes a mysterious call saying he will do \\"one more job for him.\\" The next day Jase brings home a bag full of money. Dawn then spends the money on various things including clothes and rent money for a new flat. Jase adopts Summer and his name is added to her birth certificate, after Dawn had left it blank when Summer was born. Dawn's demands continue, so Jase does more jobs for his associate. When he comes home beaten and bloodied, he is forced to admit to Dawn that he is working for Terry Bates once again. Dawn is initially furious, but despite realising that he is involved in criminal activity, she makes no attempt to stop him as she is desperate to keep the money and get the wedding of her dreams. Jase speaks of leaving Walford to escape Terry, but Dawn announces that they have set a date for their wedding, ensuring that Jase cannot leave. Upon cancelling his stag night to collect ¬£100,000 for Terry, Jase reluctantly takes Billy on as a getaway driver, revealing his intention to steal Terry's money. They agree to split the money 60/40, however upon arriving at the location of the job, there is no money, only a note stating that Terry and his men have Jay hostage and the job is a setup. When they arrive back at the flat in search of Jay, Jase and Billy are greeted by Terry and his men wielding baseball bats. Eventually, the confrontation between Jase, Terry and his men leads to violence; Jase and Billy manage to save Jay, but in the ensuing fight, Jase is brutally beaten up by Terry's men. To Billy's horror, he witnesses the assault; however, he is too frightened to help Jase and hides in the bathroom. After beating Jase up, Terry fatally stabs him. Meanwhile, Jay, hiding in the van, makes an immediate call to the police. The police arrive and arrest Terry and his men, however, Jase later dies of his injuries in hospital. Dawn learns of his death on their wedding day. Jase is last seen when Jay identifies his body in the mortuary. He is later cremated on 7 October 2008, with Jay, Dawn, Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves), Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) and Billy attending the funeral. Several months later, Billy eventually admits to Jay what happened on the night Jase died after being blackmailed by Nick Cotton (John Altham), who threatened to tell Jay about his cowardice. Viv Bates (Dido Miles), Terry's wife, and his gang threaten Billy into staying away from the court case by kidnapping Jay for security measures. Billy saves him, and he finally testifies against Terry, which results in him receiving life imprisonment for Jase's murder. Casting and characterisation Lord's casting was announced on 4 June 2007.

Lord stated that it is obvious Jay is happy to see his father, but Bert is unsure. He explained \\"The truth is Bert doesn't really know Jase. They've not had much to do with each other.

Lord added that Jase is unpredictable, which makes people wary of him. Jase's profile on the What's on TV website stated that Jase preferred to keep himself to himself and that he was determined to stay on the straight and narrow, while doing the right thing by Jay.

Mount Tennent is named after him as it was on the slopes of this steep mountain behind the village of Tharwa where many people believed he used to hide, although this is now thought to be incorrect.B. Moore, Cotter Country, Canberra, 2006, pp. 148-50. Tennant was born in Belfast, Ireland, and was 29 years old when he was sentenced to transportation to Australia for life in 1823. He arrived in Sydney on 12 July 1824 on the 'Prince Regent'. He was assigned to Joshua John Moore and to join other men, James Clarke and John McLaughlin, who had helped establish Moore's property Canberry or Canberra, the first European habitation on the Limestone Plains.Over the Hills and Tharwa Way - Eastern Namadgi National Park Ian Fraser and Margaret McJannett, CASEREC, Canberra, 1994 In 1826 Tennant and another man, John Ricks, absconded from their assigned landholder and took to the bush. Our Heritage - you are standing in it! Peter Dowling, National Trust, (undated) In July 1827 Tennant's gang raided Rose‚Äôs outstation at the Yass River, between Murrumbateman and Gunning.

McDonald, ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, pp. 11-16. Tennant, Ricks and another man held up Pialligo station on 21 November 1827, robbing it of supplies and stowing them in a hollow tree. When collecting them, two days later they were surprised and almost captured by the Pialligo and Canberry overseers. After other robberies, they tortured James Farrell in late December 1827. Two members of his gang (Cain and Murphy) were caught near Goulburn and Tennant and Ricks were sighted near Canberry by John Casey. The authorities were now closing in on him.G. A. Mawer, ‚ÄòJohn Tennant: ‚ÄúTerror of Argyle‚Äù‚Äô, Canberra History Journal, vol. 13, March 1984, p. 4; J. McDonald, ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, pp. 11-16. Capture On 8 January 1828, about 2 a.m., Mr. J. J. Moore's station was stuck up by Tennant and Rix, and all his men rounded up and placed under guard. Mr. Cowan, awakened by the noise, jumped out of bed and armed himself with a musket and handing another to his hutkeeper, William Waterson. The bushrangers demanded that Cowan should open the door and come out, to which Cowan replied that \\"he would defend his hut to the last.\\" Tennant, whom Mr. Cowan had been able to recognise (the night being moonlight), \\"making use of horrid oaths and violent threats,\\" said to Cowan, \\"If you don't come out of the hut I will burn you out.\\" Tennant's companion, who proved to be Rix called out, \\"Tennant, fire in, what signifies the life of one or two?\\" Tennant was as good as his word, and actually set the bark roof alight on two occasions, but probably from being damp the bark would not burn. At this juncture, Thomas Leahy, an assigned servant of Mr. J. J. Moore, appealed to Tennant, saving,. \\"Don't do that, Tennant, Mr. Cowan never did you any harm.\\" Tennant replied, Well, I will not burn the hut, but if anyone, Scotch, Irish, or English came after them, he would have their lives. The bushrangers then retired to the men's hut, where one of Mr. Ainslie's men was ordered to get them some food, having partaken of which the miscreants made off. At sunrise, Mr. Cowan went over to Mr. Campbell's station and reported to James Ainslie what had happened, saying, \\"It was time something was done.\\" Ainslie's reply was short,sharp, and to the purpose, characteristic of the old trooper: \\"I will go out and take them, dead or alive,\\" Cowan replying that he would go with him. Ainslie, hearing that two constables were at a neighbouring station, sent for and requested them to accompany him in pursuit of the gang, also obtaining the services of four Aboriginals as trackers. John Jones, district constable, also joined Mr. Ainslie at \\"Pialligo,\\" before making their way to \\"Canberry,\\" where Constable Fenton, Mr. Cowan, Mr. Macfarlane, and others joined the party. Leaving \\"Canberry,\\" the trackers soon picked up the track of the bushrangers, which was followed round the north side of a hill into the forest land, the track becoming quite plain and leading towards the Murrumbidgee River. After following the track for about five miles they came to a brush on rising ground, where one of the trackers named \\"Make-a-cake,\\" called out, \\"Make a light,\\" meaning that he saw the bushrangers encampment. While the party halted to arrange their plans, Ainslie, unnoticed, rushed into the tent alone and surprised Teannant and Rix. Placing his musket to Tennant's breast, he said, \\"You rascal, Tennant! If you move I will put the contents of the piece through your heart.\\" At this moment, in ignorance that Ainslie was in the tent, three shots were fired, which wounded Tennant in the neck, face, and hands, and Rix in the knee, but fortunately, Ainslie escaped injury, promptly shouting, \\"Cease firing, the men are fast.\\" Mr. Macfarlane promptly rushed to Ainslie's assistance, relieving him of Tennant, whom he gave in charge to Constable Jones. A large quantity of stolen property was recovered, and among other articles we are glad to know that Mr. Ainslie was able to swear positively to his light-coloured vest with the pearl buttons, and to his nightcap marked with his initials, but with his innate Scottish caution refused to swear to the other items, as they had \\"no particular private marks, though still believing them to belong to himself and some of his men.\\" Tennant after trial, and one of his accomplices in other robberies, were found guilty of larceny and hanged, while Rix, for some reason was found not guilty.James Ainslie later received a grant of 100 acres as a reward for assisting to capture the bushrangers John Gale in his book Canberra, its history and legendsFallick and Sons, Queanbeyan, 1927 described Tennant in romantic terms and is largely responsible for many of the myths attached to him, stating: Tennant descending from his look-out (on Mount Tennent) would bail up (a dray) - but only when his larder or wardrobe needed replenishing - terrorising the driver by presenting fire-arms and abstracting from the loading whatsoever he needed just then and order the man in charge of the team to drive on again. He never was known to use unnecessary violence or to wantonly destroy valuable cargo for what he had no need. Where Tennant stored his booty... was never discovered, not withstanding frequent and ... exhaustive serches to this end. The mountain had numerous caves and mazes well adapted... many never explored. This description of Tennant contradicts the evidence brought against him when he and Ricks were tried on 30 May 1828 in the New South Wales Supreme Court for stealing and putting John Farrell and Thomas Simpson in bodily fear. Farrell described part of the attack on him: Tennant then said, that they would boy-whip me and not take my life, and as he had a boatswain of his own, I should have fifty lashes; they then tied me up to a post, and took down my trowsers, and Tennant ordered me to receive fifty lashes, which were inflicted by Ricks, with the buckle end of a strap, and when I was ordered by Tennant to be taken down, he gave me three additional lashes; I was severely hurt, and bled very much; the prisoners took an old carbine, and an old musket, worth altogether about 10s. out of the hut, but they were brought back by the overseer immediately.R v Tennant, Ricks, Cane and Murphy John Tennant, John Ricks, James Murphy and Thomas Cain were convicted on 29 February 1828 and sentenced to hang.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/37073095?searchTerm=john%20tennant%20hanged&searchLimits;= After having their sentences commuted the men were sent instead to the notorious penal colony of Norfolk Island for 7 years. Tennant served his term arriving back in Sydney and died a year later in August 1837.

Description This species is unique among ergasilids in that it only has three pairs of legs: the fourth and fifth pairs are reduced to single spines or are completely absent. The second antenna is very distinctive, hooks on the last and penultimate segments creating an obviously claw-like structure, more obvious in the female. The male is free-living, forming part of the plankton. Both sexes have an average length of 0.5 mm.

However, this rule was short, as the company quickly found that Esmit was unable to fulfill his obligations in a satisfactory manner, and he was recalled to Denmark the year after.Westergaard, West Indies, 40 Vice-admiral Ivar Hoppe who was taking Esmit back called the inhabitants together on 8 July 1688 and told them that he wished to know if Esmit‚Äôs statement that he held the affection of all on the island was true. \\"If you want Adolph Esmit to become governor, speak now while there is yet time,\\" the vice-admiral said. To this the planters all responded as with one voice, ‚ÄúNo! if that should happen, we should all leave the land!‚Äù When asked concerning vice-governor Heins, they replied that they asked for no better governor. Heins was reinstated as governor ad interim in October of that year.

Early life and education Wright was born in Los Angeles on November 8, 1929 to Helen Taggart and Lloyd Wright (Frank Lloyd Wright Jr.). His father was a landscape architect and architect who was the eldest son of Frank Lloyd Wright Sr. Educated at the University of California, Los Angeles, Eric worked in his grandfather's (1948-1956) and father's (1956-1978) firm as an apprentice. He received his license as an architect in 1967, before establishing his own firm, Eric Lloyd Wright Architecture and Planning, in 1978. Eric lived in Topanga, California before moving to his present residence above Malibu, on land that his father, Lloyd Wright, assembled. The land was cleared of brush by Rupert Pole (Eric's half brother), Ana√Øs Nin (Eric's sister-in-law), Eric, the office staff, Lloyd and Helen, and they often used it as a picnic spot before Lloyd died in 1978. Career and philosophy in architecture \\"Wright‚Äôs early education as his grandfather‚Äôs apprentice at Taliesin and Taliesin West from 1948 to 1956 allowed him to partake in iconic projects such as New York‚Äôs Guggenheim Museum and Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin.\\" He worked in his father's firm in Hollywood, California, until 1978 when his father died. Then he began his own firm of architects and planners. Eric Lloyd Wright Architecture and Planning does design and building, and Wright also leads a nonprofit called Wright Organic Resource Center. The firm's focus is on residences, often working with other architecture firms for final construction. He has worked on larger projects, including the Sunset Community High School. He follows the concept put forth by his grandfather, termed Organic Architecture. \\"This ‚Äúorganic‚Äù concept not only predates the green-building trend of the past decade but also established the ideas that would come to be accepted as common sense concepts of smart design.\\" The nonprofit Center provides educational programs on the grounds, which also include his home and the offices of his firm. The 24-acre site was purchased by his father in 1956, but never developed. Wright inherited the land from his father, and he has developed it slowly over the years, first as an office, and beginning in 1984, as his home. Most of Wright's work is in the United States. In 1995 he worked on housing in Japan, and in 1993 he helped established Chi-Am Group Incorporated and Chi-Am Consortium, two Chinese- American architectural firms. Many of his personal and architectural records were burned in a 1993 fire at his home. He donated the papers and records of his father and grandfather to the University of California at Los Angeles prior to that, where they are safe from fires. Personal life He lives with his wife Mary, a watercolor artist. They met in 1960 in Los Angeles. They have two sons.

It was formed in 1997 when the Northern Rock company was floated on the stock exchange. The foundation has continued for a number of years after the bank was nationalised, and later purchased by Virgin Money, but in April 2014 it was announced that it would be wound down after not being able to agree funding terms with Virgin. It closed in 2016. The Northern Rock Foundation aimed to tackle disadvantage and improve quality of life in the North East and Cumbria. Between 1998 and 2016 the Foundation awarded ¬£235.8 million in 4,417 grants. History Founding The foundation was formed when the Northern Rock company was floated, with an initial donation of 15% of the share capital and a covenant to donate 5% of the company's annual profit thereafter. In 2006, Northern Rock was the second largest charitable giver in the FTSE 100 after ITV. In April 1996, when the Building Society was considering demutualisation, plans were announced by the then chairman, Robert Dickinson, for the creation of the foundation. Since the official launch of the foundation in January 1998, it has steadily grown and expanded its activities. The Foundation's work is carried out by a professional staff team of 12 based in Gosforth. Previously in 2007 there had been 25 staff at the foundation. In 2003, along with a new logo and the introduction of new programmes, the Foundation moved to a new building ‚Äì the renovated Old Chapel in Gosforth. At the end of 2006 the foundation received ¬£28.2 million investment. By the end of 2007 ¬£190 million had been donated to the foundation, by Northern Rock. Effect of the Northern Rock nationalisation Nationalisation ended the covenant requiring Northern Rock to remit a share of profits to the Foundation. Instead, for the next three years the Foundation was to receive an annual ¬£15 million payment from Northern Rock, whether it remained publicly owned or returned to the private sector. The Foundation's shares were to be cancelled and compensated in the same way as those of other shareholders. ¬£7.3 million was awarded during the first 10 months of 2008, with an expected further ¬£3.7 million before the end of the year. Effect of the Northern Rock sale to Virgin Money Upon the sale to Virgin Money, the deals with the Northern Rock Foundation was extended to at least 2013, which give Virgin and the Foundation time to discuss how they would work together; Virgin also run Virgin Money Giving, another not- for-profit company. In July 2013 Virgin Money donated ¬£500,000 to the foundation to continue its work during that year. It was announced on 22 April 2014 that after numerous discussions Virgin Money could not commit funding to the Northern Rock Foundation, and that as the foundation receives no income from any other source it will now be wound down. Also in 2014 Virgin Money announced that they would create their own charitable foundation, the Virgin Money Foundation. In January 2015 the base of the foundation, The Old Chapel, Gosforth, was sold to another group of charities, the Community Foundation serving Tyne and Wear and Northumberland. The trustees took the decision to close down the foundation on 25 April 2016. Northern Rock Foundation Hall One of the halls at the Sage Gateshead is named the Northern Rock Foundation Hall.

Some distributed systems use peer-to-peer gossip to ensure that data is disseminated to all members of a group. Some ad-hoc networks have no central registry and the only way to spread common data is to rely on each member to pass it along to their neighbours. The term epidemic protocol is sometimes used as a synonym for a gossip protocol, as gossip spreads information in a manner similar to the spread of a virus in a biological community.  Gossip communication  The concept of gossip communication can be illustrated by the analogy of office workers spreading rumors. Let's say each hour the office workers congregate around the water cooler. Each employee pairs off with another, chosen at random, and shares the latest gossip. At the start of the day, Dave starts a new rumor: he comments to Bob that he believes that Charlie dyes his mustache. At the next meeting, Bob tells Alice, while Dave repeats the idea to Eve. After each water cooler rendezvous, the number of individuals who have heard the rumor roughly doubles (though this doesn't account for gossiping twice to the same person; perhaps Dave tries to tell the story to Frank, only to find that Frank already heard it from Alice). Computer systems typically implement this type of protocol with a form of random \\"peer selection\\": with a given frequency, each machine picks another machine at random and shares any hot rumors. The issue with the term \\"gossip\\" is that quality of service (i.e. complete and timely dissemination) is predicated on the requirement that each member does not discriminate and ensures prompt and dependable transmission of the data to every member of their own peer network. In a real office gossip scenario, not everyone is privy to the gossip that is being spread. Gossip, versus broadcast, is discriminatory and often participants are left out of vital or important communications. As such, the comparison to 'office gossip' is not as good as the comparison to the spread of an epidemic. Nevertheless, the technique of peer-to-peer communication is sometimes referred to as \\"gossip\\".  Many variants and styles  There are probably hundreds of variants of specific Gossip-like protocols because each use-scenario is likely to be customized to the organization's specific needs. For example, a gossip protocol might employ some of these ideas: * The core of the protocol involves periodic, pairwise, inter-process interactions. * The information exchanged during these interactions is of bounded size. * When agents interact, the state of at least one agent changes to reflect the state of the other. * Reliable communication is not assumed. * The frequency of the interactions is low compared to typical message latencies so that the protocol costs are negligible. * There is some form of randomness in the peer selection. Peers might be selected from the full set of nodes or from a smaller set of neighbors. * Due to the replication there is an implicit redundancy of the delivered information. Gossip protocol types It is useful to distinguish two prevailing styles of gossip protocol: * Dissemination protocols (or rumor- mongering protocols). These use gossip to spread information; they basically work by flooding agents in the network, but in a manner that produces bounded worst-case loads: *# Event dissemination protocols use gossip to carry out multicasts. They report events, but the gossip occurs periodically and events don't actually trigger the gossip. One concern here is the potentially high latency from when the event occurs until it is delivered. *# Background data dissemination protocols continuously gossip about information associated with the participating nodes. Typically, propagation latency isn't a concern, perhaps because the information in question changes slowly or there is no significant penalty for acting upon slightly stale data. * Protocols that compute aggregates. These compute a network-wide aggregate by sampling information at the nodes in the network and combining the values to arrive at a system-wide value ‚Äì the largest value for some measurement nodes are making, smallest, etc. The key requirement is that the aggregate must be computable by fixed-size pairwise information exchanges; these typically terminate after a number of rounds of information exchange logarithmic in the system size, by which time an all-to-all information flow pattern will have been established. As a side effect of aggregation, it is possible to solve other kinds of problems using gossip; for example, there are gossip protocols that can arrange the nodes in a gossip overlay into a list sorted by node-id (or some other attribute) in logarithmic time using aggregation-style exchanges of information. Similarly, there are gossip algorithms that arrange nodes into a tree and compute aggregates such as \\"sum\\" or \\"count\\" by gossiping in a pattern biased to match the tree structure. Many protocols that predate the earliest use of the term \\"gossip\\" fall within this rather inclusive definition. For example, Internet routing protocols often use gossip-like information exchanges. A gossip substrate can be used to implement a standard routed network: nodes \\"gossip\\" about traditional point-to-point messages, effectively pushing traffic through the gossip layer. Bandwidth permitting, this implies that a gossip system can potentially support any classic protocol or implement any classical distributed service. However, such a broadly inclusive interpretation is rarely intended. More typically gossip protocols are those that specifically run in a regular, periodic, relatively lazy, symmetric and decentralized manner; the high degree of symmetry among nodes is particularly characteristic. Thus, while one could run a 2-phase commit protocol over a gossip substrate, doing so would be at odds with the spirit, if not the wording, of the definition. The term convergently consistent is sometimes used to describe protocols that achieve exponentially rapid spread of information. For this purpose, a protocol must propagate any new information to all nodes that will be affected by the information within time logarithmic in the size of the system (the \\"mixing time\\" must be logarithmic in system size).  Examples  Suppose that we want to find the object that most closely matches some search pattern, within a network of unknown size, but where the computers are linked to one another and where each machine is running a small agent program that implements a gossip protocol. * To start the search, a user would ask the local agent to begin to gossip about the search string. (We're assuming that agents either start with a known list of peers, or retrieve this information from some kind of a shared store.) * Periodically, at some rate (let's say ten times per second, for simplicity), each agent picks some other agent at random, and gossips with it. Search strings known to A will now also be known to B, and vice versa. In the next \\"round\\" of gossip A and B will pick additional random peers, maybe C and D. This round-by-round doubling phenomenon makes the protocol very robust, even if some messages get lost, or some of the selected peers are the same or already know about the search string. * On receipt of a search string for the first time, each agent checks its local machine for matching documents. * Agents also gossip about the best match, to date. Thus, if A gossips with B, after the interaction, A will know of the best matches known to B, and vice versa. Best matches will \\"spread\\" through the network. If the messages might get large (for example, if many searches are active all at the same time), a size limit should be introduced. Also, searches should \\"age out\\" of the network. It follows that within logarithmic time in the size of the network (the number of agents), any new search string will have reached all agents. Within an additional delay of the same approximate length, every agent will learn where the best match can be found. In particular, the agent that started the search will have found the best match. For example, in a network with 25,000 machines, we can find the best match after about 30 rounds of gossip: 15 to spread the search string and 15 more to discover the best match. A gossip exchange could occur as often as once every tenth of a second without imposing undue load, hence this form of network search could search a big data center in about 3 seconds. In this scenario, searches might automatically age out of the network after, say, 10 seconds. By then, the initiator knows the answer and there is no point in further gossip about that search. Gossip protocols have also been used for achieving and maintaining distributed database consistency or with other types of data in consistent states, counting the number of nodes in a network of unknown size, spreading news robustly, organizing nodes according to some structuring policy, building so-called overlay networks, computing aggregates, sorting the nodes in a network, electing leaders, etc.  Epidemic algorithms  Gossip protocols can be used to propagate information in a manner rather similar to the way that a viral infection spreads in a biological population. Indeed, the mathematics of epidemics are often used to model the mathematics of gossip communication. The term epidemic algorithm is sometimes employed when describing a software system in which this kind of gossip-based information propagation is employed.  See also  *Gossip protocols are just one class among many classes of networking protocols. See also virtual synchrony, distributed state machines, Paxos algorithm, database transactions. Each class contains tens or even hundreds of protocols, differing in their details and performance properties but similar at the level of the guarantees offered to users. *Some gossip protocols replace the random peer selection mechanism with a more deterministic scheme. For example, in the NeighbourCast algorithm, instead of talking to random nodes, information is spread by talking only to neighbouring nodes. There are a number of algorithms that use similar ideas. A key requirement when designing such protocols is that the neighbor set trace out an expander graph. *Routing *Tribler, BitTorrent peer to peer client using gossip protocol.

Ireland Quartermaster sergeant appointments in the Irish Defence Forces include: *Battalion quartermaster sergeant *Battery quartermaster sergeant *Company quartermaster sergeant *Flight quartermaster sergeant *Regimental quartermaster sergeant *Squadron quartermaster sergeant United Kingdom A quartermaster sergeant in the British Army and Royal Marines is usually a non-commissioned officer or warrant officer who is responsible for supplies or stores. However, in the Army this definition is extended to almost any warrant officer class 2 who does not hold a sergeant major appointment, as well as a number of staff sergeant and colour sergeant appointments. In the British Army, quartermaster sergeants are frequently addressed and referred to as \\"Q\\". However, infantry company quartermaster sergeants are always addressed by their rank, as \\"Colour Sergeant\\" or \\"Colour\\", and not their appointment. Examples of staff sergeant quartermaster sergeant appointments include: *Battery quartermaster sergeant *Company quartermaster sergeant *Squadron quartermaster sergeant Examples of warrant officer class 2 quartermaster sergeant appointments include: *Artificer quartermaster sergeant *Quartermaster sergeant instructor *Regimental quartermaster sergeant *Staff quartermaster sergeant *Technical quartermaster sergeant *Orderly room quartermaster sergeant In the Household Cavalry, which does not use the term \\"sergeant\\", the designation is replaced with quartermaster corporal (QMC), as in squadron quartermaster corporal and regimental quartermaster corporal. In the Royal Marines, quartermaster sergeant was an actual rank between colour sergeant and regimental sergeant major (and equivalent to warrant officer class II in the Army) until the Royal Marines themselves re-adopted the ranks of warrant officer class I and II in 1973 (although the term continued to be used interchangeably for warrant officers class II until at least 1981). Quartermaster sergeants could also hold the appointments of company sergeant major and staff bandmaster. United States Early quartermaster sergeants In 1776 the Continental Army established the rank of quartermaster sergeant as the second most senior soldier in the non-commissioned headquarters element of an infantry regiment. The regulations by General von Steuben officially gives the duties as: \\"The Quartermaster Sergeant assisted the regimental quartermaster, assuming his duties in the quartermaster's absence and supervising the proper loading and transport of the regiment's baggage when on march.\\"von Steuben The succeeding U.S. Army kept the rank. When the army formalised chevrons as rank insignia for their non-commissioned officers, quartermaster sergeants were given the insignia of a down-pointed chevron of worsted braid above the elbow of each arm in the same colour as the buttons of the regiment or corps.Institute of Heraldry Although the Continental Marines did not have quartermaster sergeants, the U.S. Marine Corps introduced the rank when it was established, initially having only one quartermaster sergeant who was attached to the corps headquarters (like all NCOs above the rank of sergeant).Tucker, p. 975 American Civil War 100px The rank was in use by both the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. The rank was below sergeant major and above ordnance sergeant. The same rank insignia was used by both armies. Both armies varied the colour of the stripes by assigning red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, and blue for infantry. Some Confederate militia units varied these colours even further and had other colours; an example being the black stripes used by infantry units from North Carolina. Additionally, on 4 May 1861, each company of Union cavalry was authorised a company quartermaster sergeant. The company quartermaster sergeant was responsible for the company wagon and all the property it contained, including the tents, the company mess gear, the company desk, the company library, the ordnance, the subsistence provisions, and the company tools. He was further charged with overseeing the camp set-up of the tents and picket lines. He inspected the company horses and mules, and reported any problems to the veterinary surgeon of the regiment. He was also responsible for acquiring fuel, forage for the horses, and straw for bedding for the company. These were normally drawn from the supplies of the regimental quartermaster, along with replacements for uniforms and equipment. When they were not available from stores, the company quartermaster sergeant was responsible for forage parties to acquire them. The company quartermaster sergeant was required to sign for the uniforms and equipment that were in his custody and before disbursing these items to a soldier, he required a signature of receipt, countersigned by an officer. U.S. Cavalry company quartermaster chevrons The rank of company quartermaster sergeant was not a command position, although he was required to know the drills and the duties and responsibilities of the line NCOs. He was the second most senior NCO in the company after the first sergeant. During combat, his place was safeguarding the company wagon and its supplies. He was generally required to fight only in defence of the company property. In an extreme emergency, he could be used to replace a fallen line NCO, but this was extremely rare. The wagons were driven by teamsters, who were usually members of the company. Also, each cavalry company was authorized a wagoneer with the rank of corporal. The company quartermaster sergeant wore three chevrons with a single straight tie in worsted. Although worn by volunteer cavalry from 1862, this rank badge was not incorporated into United States military regulations until 1866. The rank and insignia were also used by the Confederate Army during the war. Likewise, a battery quartermaster sergeant was also authorised for every artillery battery. They began to adopt the same unofficial chevrons as the cavalry from May 1863. Regimental Supply Sergeant chevrons Later quartermaster sergeants In 1889 the army began to appointment soldiers to the rank of post quartermaster sergeant. The authorised insignia consisted of three chevrons below a crossed key and quill. In 1902 the rank was renamed on the regimental level and now was the regimental supply sergeant. The insignia consisted of three chevrons (now pointed upwards) and a triple tie; initially all in the colours of the corps and in standard olive colour during World War I. However, additional quartermaster sergeants existed on company and battalion level. After the war the army overhauled its rank system during 1920 and 1921, as it was too cumbersome with 128 different insignias. All variants of the quartermaster sergeant were discontinued in 1921.

Her promising military career was cut short by death from cancer seven years later. She was posthumously awarded the M√©daille de l'A√©ronautique (Aeronautics Medal). Background Born in Montauban, Aigle spent her early years in Africa, where her father served as a military physician. After reaching her fourteenth birthday, she matriculated at the Lyc√©e militaire de Saint-Cyr (Saint-Cyr Military High School), remaining for the three-year period from the second term until graduation. She subsequently proceeded to Prytan√©e Militaire, an advanced military high school, and then to the military academy wing of the prestigious √âcole Polytechnique, France's foremost school of engineering. During her first year (1994‚Äì95), she fulfilled the requirements of her military duty while stationed with the 13th Battalion of the elite mountain infantry, the Chasseurs Alpins. She served her final year before graduation from the Polytechnique (1996‚Äì97) in the √âcole de l'Air, the French Air Force's officer candidate school. Career After graduating from the Polytechnique, Aigle chose to join the French Air Force. On 28 May 1999, she became the first woman to receive the Air Force's coveted fighter pilot wings. She was assigned to the Mirage 2000-5 in the escadron 2/2 \\"C√¥te-d'Or\\" in 2000, and promoted to the rank of Commandant (roughly equivalent to Major) in 2005. Among the top candidates, she was also on the verge of being selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency. By the time of her sudden death three weeks before her 33rd birthday (the cancer, a melanoma, had been diagnosed only a month earlier), she had accumulated a total of 1600 hours of flight time. Aigle was a keen athlete and represented the Air Force in inter-service sports competitions. She was the 1997 French military champion in triathlon, followed by the 1997 triathlon world championship in military team competition. Still competing in 1999, she and her team won the triathlon world military vice- championship. She was also a skydiver and free-fall parachutist. Death Aigle was pregnant when she was first diagnosed with rapidly progressing cancer, and refused to undergo an abortion despite the increased difficulty in cancer treatment options. Her son Gabriel was delivered by caesarean section, five-and-a half months into term, fifteen days before her death on 21 August 2007. She and her husband already had one other child. On 2 October 2007, President Sarkozy posthumously awarded her the M√©daille de l'A√©ronautique (Aeronautics Medal).

Schematic circuit of a Œ†-pad attenuator. The Œ† pad (pi pad) is a specific type of attenuator circuit in electronics whereby the topology of the circuit is formed in the shape of the Greek letter \\"Œ†\\". Attenuators are used in electronics to reduce the level of a signal. They are also referred to as pads due to their effect of padding down a signal by analogy with acoustics. Attenuators have a flat frequency response attenuating all frequencies equally in the band they are intended to operate. The attenuator has the opposite task of an amplifier. The topology of an attenuator circuit will usually follow one of the simple filter sections. However, there is no need for more complex circuitry, as there is with filters, due to the simplicity of the frequency response required. Circuits are required to be balanced or unbalanced depending on the geometry of the transmission lines they are to be used with. For radio frequency applications, the format is often unbalanced, such as coaxial. For audio and telecommunications, balanced circuits are usually required, such as with the twisted pair format. The Œ† pad is intrinsically an unbalanced circuit. However, it can be converted to a balanced circuit by placing half the series resistance in the return path. Such a circuit is called a box section because the circuit is formed in the shape of a box. Terminology Unbalanced source and load. V1o is open circuit voltage of the source. An attenuator is a form of a two-port network with a generator connected to one port and a load connected to the other. In all of the circuits given below it is assumed that the generator and load impedances are purely resistive (though not necessarily equal) and that the attenuator circuit is required to perfectly match to these. The symbols used for these impedances are; :Z_1 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! the impedance of the generator :Z_2 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! the impedance of the load Popular values of impedance are 600Œ© in telecommucations and audio, 75Œ© for video and dipole antennae, 50Œ© for RF The voltage transfer function, A, is, :A = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm {out}}{V_\\\\mathrm {in}} While the inverse of this is the loss, L, of the attenuator, :L = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm {in}}{V_\\\\mathrm {out}} The value of attenuation is normally marked on the attenuator as its loss, LdB, in decibels (dB). The relationship with L is; :L_\\\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\\\log L \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Popular values of attenuator are 3dB, 6dB, 10dB, 20dB and 40dB. However, it is often more convenient to express the loss in nepers, : L = e^\\\\gamma \\\\, where \\\\gamma \\\\, is the attenuation in nepers (one neper is approximately 8.7 dB). Impedance and loss Figure 2. A general L-section circuit with shunt admittance Y and series impedance Z. The values of resistance of the attenuator's elements can be calculated using image parameter theory. The starting point here is the image impedances of the L section in figure 2. The image admittance of the input is, :Y_\\\\mathrm {i \\\\Pi} = \\\\sqrt {Y^2 + \\\\frac{Y}{Z}} and the image impedance of the output is, :Z_\\\\mathrm {i T} = \\\\sqrt {Z^2 + \\\\frac{Z}{Y}} The loss of the L section when terminated in its image impedances is, :L_\\\\mathrm {L1} = \\\\sqrt{Z_\\\\mathrm {i \\\\Pi} Y_\\\\mathrm {i T}} \\\\ e^{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm L} where the image parameter transmission function, Œ≥L is given by, :\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm L=\\\\sinh^{-1}{\\\\sqrt{ZY}} The loss of this L section in the reverse direction is given by, :L_\\\\mathrm {L2}=\\\\sqrt{Z_\\\\mathrm {i T} Y_\\\\mathrm {i \\\\Pi}} \\\\ e^{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm L} Figure 3. A Œ†-pad attenuator formed from two symmetrical L sections. Because of the symmetry, R1 = R3 in this case. For an attenuator, Z and Y are simple resistors and Œ≥ becomes the image parameter attenuation (that is, the attenuation when terminated with the image impedances) in nepers. A Œ† pad can be viewed as being two L sections back-to-back as shown in figure 3. Most commonly, the generator and load impedances are equal so that and a symmetrical Œ† pad is used. In this case, the impedance matching terms inside the square roots all cancel and, :L_\\\\mathrm \\\\Pi = L_\\\\mathrm {L1} L_\\\\mathrm {L2} = e^{2 \\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm L} = e^{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm \\\\Pi} \\\\, Substituting Z and Y for the corresponding resistors, :\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm \\\\Pi = 2 \\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm L = 2 \\\\sinh^{-1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{R_2}{2R_1}}} \\\\, :\\\\frac {1}{Z_0} = \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {1}{{R_1}^2} + \\\\frac {2}{R_1 R_2}} These equations can easily be extended to non-symmetrical cases. Resistor values The equations above find the impedance and loss for an attenuator with given resistor values. The usual requirement in a design is the other way around ‚Äì the resistor values for a given impedance and loss are needed. These can be found by transposing and substituting the last two equations above; :If Z_0 = Z_1 = Z_2 \\\\, : R_1 = Z_0 \\\\coth \\\\left ( \\\\frac {\\\\gamma_ \\\\mathrm \\\\Pi}{2} \\\\right ) = Z_0 \\\\frac {1 + A} {1 - A} with A = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm {out}}{V_\\\\mathrm {in}} : R_2 = \\\\frac {2R_1}{\\\\left ( \\\\frac {R_1}{Z_0} \\\\right ) ^2 -1} O pad Pi pads, O pads and split O pads The unbalanced pi pad can be converted to a balanced O pad by putting one half of Rz in each side of a balanced line. The simple four element O pad attenuates the differential mode signal but does little to attenuate any common mode signal. To insure attenuation of the common mode signal also, a split O pad can be created by splitting and grounding Rx and Ry. Conversion of two-port to pi pad Conversion of two-port admittance parameters to pi pad If a passive two-port can be expressed with admittance parameters, then that two-port is equivalent to a pi pad. In general, the admittance parameters are frequency dependent and not necessarily resistive. In that case the elements of the pi pad would not be simple components. However, in the case where the two-port is purely resistive or substantially resistive over the frequency range of interest, then the two-port can be replaced with a pi pad made of resistors. Conversion of tee pad to pi pad Conversion of tee pad to pi pad Pi pads and tee pads are easily converted back and forth. If one of the pads is composed of only resistors then the other is also composed entirely of resistors.

The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on July 10, 2007. Plot Retired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure. Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar has been eliminated, the assignment is still considered to be failure by Collins because Dial had been filmed fleeing the scene by a security camera. Meanwhile, Collins is being investigated in the USA for running a CIA hit squad, and if the truth gets back about Dial and the death of Chief Inspector Andrew Windsor (Charles Dance) which happens during a shoot-out, Collins will be exposed. Stopping at nothing to keep his name clean, Collins frames Dial for the murder of the chief inspector, even though Collins was actually responsible for his death. Dial, now a wanted man by Collins and the British police, must do whatever it takes to prove his innocence, knowing that Inspector Annette Ballard (Lena Headey), Windsor's vengeful daughter, is also after him. While Dial is being pursued by Collins and his rogue hit squad, Dial saves the life of Inspector Ballard, who found herself in Collins' cross hairs. Having earned Ballard's trust, Dial is seen by Ballard bidding farewell to young Emily who played a key role in Dial's survival. Later on, it is shown that Dial sent Emily a letter, along with two tickets to America, to see him and his horse Beauty on his ranch. The last scene shows Emily and Dial at the ranch in Montana, watching Beauty run free.

In addition to arguing against the persecution of individuals solely for being Christian, Justin also provides the Emperor with a defense of the philosophy of Christianity and a detailed explanation of contemporary Christian practices and rituals. This work, along with the Second Apology, has been cited as one of the earliest examples of Christian apology, and many scholars attribute this work to creating a new genre of apology out of what was a typical Roman administrative procedure. Justin Martyr‚Äôs life and background Justin Martyr was born in Flavia Neapolis (modern Nablus), a Greek-speaking town in Judea within the Roman Empire. In the Dialogue with Trypho, Justin explains how he came to Christianity after previously passing through the schools of Stoicism, Peripateticism, and Pythagoreanism. After becoming interested in Platonism, Justin eventually converted to Christianity after an encounter with an old man, which Justin describes in the Dialogue as ‚Äúa love of the prophets, and of those people who are friends of Christ [that] possessed me.‚Äù The equating of Christianity with philosophy is important for Justin, as it explains the importance of the Apologies in defending Christianity in philosophical terms. The First Apology is dated to between AD 155-157, based on the reference to Felix as a recent prefect of Egypt. Robert Grant has claimed that this Apology was made in response to the Martyrdom of Polycarp, which occurred around the same time as the Apology was written. This correlation would explain why the Apology heavily focused on punishment by fire; a reference to Polycarp‚Äôs burning at the stake. It is also generally believed that the Second Apology was originally part of the larger First Apology, although there is uncertainty among scholars about this point. Themes in the First Apology Addressing criticisms of Christians In the early chapters of the First Apology, Justin discusses the principal criticisms of contemporary Christians; namely, atheism, immorality, and disloyalty to the Empire. He first argues that ‚Äúthe name‚Äù of Christianity by itself is not reason enough to punish or persecute, and he urges the Empire instead to only punish evil actions, writing, ‚ÄúFor from a name neither approval nor punishment could fairly come, unless something excellent or evil in action can be shown about it.‚Äù1 Apology, Ch. 4 He then goes on to address the charges more directly, in which he argues that they are ‚Äúatheists‚Äù toward Roman gods, but not to the ‚Äúmost true God.‚Äù1 Apology, Ch. 6 He acknowledges that some Christians have performed immoral acts, but urges officials to punish these individuals as evildoers rather than Christians.1 Apology, Ch. 7 With this claim, Justin demonstrates his desire to separate the Christian name from the evil acts performed by certain individuals, lamenting how criminals tarnish the name of Christianity and are not true ‚ÄúChristians.‚Äù Finally, he addresses the alleged disloyalty to the Empire, discussing how Christians do seek to be members of another kingdom, but this kingdom is ‚Äúof that with God‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúhuman one.‚Äù1 Apology, Ch. 11 Jesus Christ as the Logos Justin goes to great lengths in the First Apology to defend Christianity as a rational philosophy. He remarks at how Christianity can provide moral teaching for its followers,1 Apology, Ch. 14-20 and how many of the Christian teachings parallel similar stories in pagan mythology, making it irrational for contemporary pagans to persecute Christians.1 Apology, Ch. 21-22 One of Justin‚Äôs most important themes involves his description of the logos, a philosophical concept of order of reason and knowledge. Throughout the First Apology, Justin argues that Jesus Christ is the incarnation of the Logos, which leads him to the proof that any individual who has spoken with reason, even those who lived before Christ, connected with the logos in the form of Christ, and is thus, in fact, a Christian.1 Apology, Ch. 46 This theme is paramount to understanding Justin‚Äôs defense of Christianity, and was a groundbreaking statement in Christian apologetic writing. The use of the term ‚Äúlogos‚Äù indicates that Justin likely drew upon prior philosophical teachings, but Justin makes the argument that these teachings represent only partial truth because they possess and are connected with only part of the overall logos. For Justin, Christianity represents the full truth (logos), meaning that Christianity is not only a meaningful philosophy, but it also completes and corrects prior thought to achieve the highest level of knowledge and reason. Early Church practices The First Apology provides one of the most detailed accounts of contemporary Christian practice. Those that are baptized are ‚Äúbrought by us where there is water,‚Äù where they are ‚Äúborn again in the same manner of rebirth by which we ourselves were born again.‚Äù1 Apology, Ch. 61 After the discussion of baptism, Justin describes the practice of the Eucharist, by his teachings of transubstantiation, ‚Äúwe have been taught that the food over which thanks have been given by a word of prayer that is from Him, from which our blood and flesh are nourished by transformation, is the flesh and blood of Jesus who became incarnate.‚Äù.1 Apology, Ch. 66 Finally, he provides information on the weekly Sunday meetings of the congregation, consisting of readings from the Jewish prophets and \\"the memoirs of the apostles\\", prayers, and a meal.1 Apology, Ch. 67 Historical and literary significance There has been significant scholarly debate about the extent to which Justin‚Äôs Apologies differed from prior and future apologetic discourse. Paul Parvis, a prominent Justin scholar from the University of Edinburgh, has noted that the First Apology is unlike any apology that preceded it. It presents itself as legal petition, a standard Roman administrative genre that seeks to change a legal precedent (in this case, asking Christians to be charged based on evil deeds rather than for being Christian in and of itself). But by including the descriptions of Christian practice and belief, Parvis argues that ‚Äú[w]hat Justin did was to hijack this normal Roman administrative procedure and turn it into a vehicle for articulating and disseminating the message of the Gospel.‚Äù Sara Parvis, also from Edinburgh, further argues that scholars should do away with the classic conception of Christian apology as a ‚Äúvague group of writings offering some kind of defense of Christianity,‚Äù and instead think of the category as one that was actually invented by Justin Martyr and then refined by later authors like Tertullian. Scholars also note the importance of the explanation of Christian practice in defending the community as a whole. Robert Grant, has noted that Justin did not provide much detail into the theological reasoning behind early Church practices. Instead, he argues that Justin aimed to provide this information to both ‚Äúput forth the real nature of Christian life‚Äù and refute the slanderous claims of pagan critics.

Federal legislation also affects some aspects of sex work throughout Australia, and of Australian citizens abroad. Though Australia is largely homogenous in its attitude to prostitution, the legal responses of the nine separate jurisdictions have differed. Some of the differences have been due to political factors. Eastern Australian states and territories liberalised their laws in the late 20th century; but liberalisation has been restricted by upper houses of Parliament of several states, with legislation either defeated or extensively amended. New South Wales was the first state or territory to adopt a different model, decriminalising prostitution in 1979. This became a model for New Zealand and a failed attempt in Western Australia in 2008. Victoria and Queensland adopted different models, based on legalisation‚ÄîVictoria in 1986 and Queensland in 1992. In the remaining states of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, despite intense debate and many proposed legislative reforms there has been no change in the laws. The Australian Capital Territory adopted partial decriminalisation in 1992, and the Northern Territory allowed partial decriminalisation in 1992 and full decriminalisation in 2019. In all jurisdictions the issue remains divisive, and in the three eastern states with regulated prostitution there has been intermittent review. Much of the information in this article concerns cisgender heterosexual, not homosexual or transgender, prostitution. In Australia, legislation and regulation has progressively replaced the terms \\"prostitute\\" and \\"prostitution\\" with \\"sex worker\\" and \\"sex work\\". The United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), which issues regular statistics on sex work, estimated there were around 20,500 sex workers in Australia in 2016. Scarlet Alliance, a national peer sex worker NGO, provides advocacy for sex workers in Australia. Legislative status 2020  History  Sex work in Australia has operated differently depending on the period of time evaluated. For this reason discussion is divided into three distinct periods: convict, late colonial, and post-federation. Pre-colonial \\"prostitution\\" among Aboriginal peoples is not considered here, since it bore little resemblance to contemporary understanding of the term. The arrival of the Europeans changed this \\"wife exchange\\" system, once they started exchanging their European goods for sexual services from Aboriginal women. During the convict period, English common law applied, and dealt with brothel keeping, disorderly houses, and public nuisance. The late colonial period viewed prostitution as a public health issue, through the Contagious Diseases Acts. Since Federation in 1901, the emphasis has been on criminalising activities associated with prostitution. Although not explicitly prohibiting paid sex, the criminal law effectively produced a de facto prohibition.  Convict period 1788‚Äì1840  Prostitution probably first appeared in Australia at the time of the First Fleet in 1788. Some of the women transported to Australia had previously worked in prostitution, while others chose the profession due to economic circumstances, and a severe imbalance of the sexes. While the 1822 Bigge Inquiry refers to brothels, these were mainly women working from their own homes.  Colonial period 1840‚Äì1901  In the colonial period, prior to federation, Australia adopted the Contagious Diseases Acts of the United Kingdom between 1868 and 1879 in an attempt to control venereal disease in the military, requiring compulsory inspection of women suspected of prostitution, and could include incarceration in a lock hospital.  Federal period 1901‚Äì1970s After federation, criminal law was left in the hands of the states. But criminal law relating to prostitution only dates from around 1910. These laws did not make the act of prostitution illegal but did criminalise many activities related to prostitution. These laws were based on English laws passed between 1860 and 1885, and related to soliciting, age restrictions, brothel keeping, and leasing accommodation. Post 1970s Since the 1970s there has been a change toward liberalisation of prostitution laws, but although attitudes to prostitution are largely homogenous, the actual approaches have varied. A May 1990 Australian Institute of Criminology report recommended that prostitution not be a criminal offence, since the laws were ineffective and endangered sex workers. The NSW Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption in 1995 recommended sex work be decriminalised to curb corruption and abuse of power. A survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of Australian men aged 16‚Äì59 have paid for sex at least once in their life and 1.9% had done so in the past year. Men who had paid for sex were more likely than other men to smoke, to drink more alcohol, to have had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or been tested for HIV, to have more sexual partners, to have first had vaginal intercourse before 16, and to have had heterosexual anal intercourse. The United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS UNAIDS has estimated the number of sex workers in Australia in 2012‚Äì2014 as between 20‚Äì25,000. Scarlet Alliance, a national peer sex worker NGO, provides advocacy for sex workers in Australia.  Health  Health and safety regulations and peer education have been effective at keeping STIs in the sex worker population at a low level, similar to the general population, and comparable among the states. Although there had been claims that sex workers were responsible for STI levels in mining communities, subsequent research has shown this not to be true.  Human trafficking in Australia  The number of people trafficked into or within Australia is unknown. Estimates given to a 2004 parliamentary inquiry into sexual servitude in Australia ranged from 300 to 1,000 trafficked women annually. In 2006, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Trafficking in persons: global patterns lists Australia as one of 21 trafficking destination countries in the high category. Australia did not become a party to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others when it was implemented in 1949. It has implemented in 1999 the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, to which it is a party. Australia has also ratified on 8 January 2007 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, which requires it to prohibit, besides other things, child prostitution. For the purpose of the Protocol, a child is any human being under the age of 18, unless an earlier age of majority is recognised by a country's law. In all Australian jurisdictions, the minimum age at which a person can engage in prostitution is 18 years, although it is argued against the age of consent, and it is always illegal to engage another in prostitution.  Australian Capital Territory  Sex work in the Australian Capital Territory is governed by the Sex Work Act 1992, also known as \\"Anna's Law\\", following partial decriminalisation in 1992. Brothels are legal, but sex workers were required to register with the Office of Regulatory Services (ORS), subsequently Access Canberra. The ORS also registered and regulated brothels and escort agencies. Sex workers may work privately but must work alone. Soliciting remains illegal (Section 19). Subsequent amending acts include the Prostitution Amendment Act 2002 and the Justice and Community Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2011. (Part 1.7), a minor administrative amendment.  History  Prior to passage of the Prostitution Act 1992, prostitution policy in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) consisted of \\"containment and control\\" under the Police Offences Act 1930. This prohibited keeping a brothel, persistently soliciting in a public place, or living on the earnings of prostitution. This law was not enforced. In 1991 a report entitled Prostitution in the ACT: Interim Report (Australian Capital Territory) was produced by the Select Committee on HIV, Illegal Drugs and Prostitution describing the then state of the industry, the shortcomings of the law, and the possible reforms available. Having considered the example of other Australian States that had adopted various other models, the committee recommended decriminalization, which occurred in the 1992 Prostitution Act. Sex workers and brothel owners were required to register with the Office of Regulatory Services (ORS), subsequently Access Canberra, as were escort agencies, including sole operators.  Legislative review 2011  The legal situation was reviewed again with a Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety's inquiry into the ACT Prostitution Act 1992, following the death of a 16-year-old woman, Janine Cameron, from a heroin overdose in a brothel in 2008. The inquiry was established on 28 October 2010. The committee, chaired by ACT Liberal MLA Vicki Dunne, devised terms of reference that were as follows: * the form and operation of the Act * identifying regulatory options, including the desirability of requiring commercially operated brothels to maintain records of workers and relevant proof of age, to ensure that all sex workers are over the age of 18 years * the adequacy of, and compliance with, occupational health and safety requirements for sex workers * any links with criminal activity * the extent to which unlicensed operators exist within the ACT * other relevant matterInquiry into Prostitution Act: Terms of Reference Written submissions were required by 26 February 2011 at which time 58 submissions had been received.Inquiry into Prostitution Act: Submissions Submissions to the committee included Scarlet Alliance. The Alliance requested changes that would allow sex workers to work together, the removal of registration (which is rarely complied with), and the repeal of sections 24 and 25 dealing with sexually transmitted diseases. The Eros Association, which represents the industry also called for removal of registration and for an expansion into residential areas.Sex trade eyes the suburbs. Canberra Times March 2011 As in other States and Territories, conservative Christian groups such as the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) called for criminalising clients. Groups supporting this position included the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women Australia,Coalition Against Trafficking in Women Australia and the Catholic Church. Sex workers argued against it. Ms Dunne stated that the committee would consider exit schemes; however Attorney-General Simon Corbell stated that it was unlikely there will be any substantive changes to the status quo. The committee completed its hearings on evidence on 13 July 2011, and issued its report in February 2012.Report on Inquiry into the Prostitution Act 1992. February 2012 The Government issued a formal response in June, stating it would follow most of the recommendations and that the inquiry had affirmed that sex work was a legitimate occupation. In the October 2012 elections the opposition Liberals campaigned on a platform to oppose allowing more than one sex worker to use a premise in suburban areas but were not successful in preventing a further term of the ALP Green alliance.  Advocacy  Advocacy for sex workers in the ACT is undertaken by SWOP ACT (Sex Work Outreach Project).  New South Wales  New South Wales (NSW) has the most liberal legislation on prostitution in Australia, with almost complete decriminalisation, and has been a model for other jurisdictions such as New Zealand. Brothels are legal in NSW under the Summary Offences Act 1988.. The main activities that are illegal are: * living on the earnings of a prostitute, although persons who own or manage a brothel are exempt * causing or inducing prostitution (procuring: Crimes Act s.91A,B) * using premises, or allowing premises to be used, for prostitution that are held out as being available for massage, sauna baths, steam baths, facilities for exercise, or photographic studios * advertising that a premise is used for prostitution, or advertising for prostitutes * soliciting for prostitution near or within view of a dwelling, school, church or hospital * engaging in child prostitution (Crimes Act s.91C-F) Definitions. According to a 2009 report in the Daily Telegraph, illegal brothels in Sydney outnumbered licensed operations by four to one.  History   Early era  NSW was founded in 1788 and was responsible for Tasmania until 1825, Victoria until 1851 and Queensland until 1859. It inherited much of the problems of port cities, penal colonies, and the gender imbalance of colonial life. Initially there was little specific legislation aimed at prostitution, but prostitutes could be charged under vagrancy provisions if their behaviour drew undue attention. In 1822 Commissioner Bigge reported stated there were 20 brothels in Sydney, and many women at the Parramatta Female Factory were involved in prostitution.J.T. Bigge. Report of the Commissioner of Inquiry into the colony of NSW. 1822 The Prevention of Vagrancy Act 1835 was designed to deal with 'undesirables'. In 1848 the Sydney Female Refuge Society was set up in Pitt Street to care for prostitutes; its buildings were demolished in 1901 to make way for the new Central Railway Station.SYDNEY FEMALE REFUGE SOCIETY. (8 March 1864). Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875), p. 5. Retrieved 5 February 2019 The 1859 Select Committee into the Condition of the Working Classes of the Metropolis described widespread prostitution. Nineteenth-century legislation included the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 and Police Offences Act 1901. Attempts to pass contagious diseases legislation were resisted, and unlike other States, legislative control was minimal till the general attack on 'vice' of the first decade of the twentieth century which resulted in the Police Offences Amendment Act 1908, and the Prisoners Detention Act. Street prostitution was controlled by the Vagrancy Act 1902 (sec. 4[1] [c]) enabling a woman to be arrested as a 'common prostitute'. This was strengthened by an amendment of the Police Offences (Amendment) Act 1908, which also prohibited living on the earnings.  Modern era  = Strengthening the laws = The Vagrancy Act was further strengthened in 1968, making it an offence to 'loiter for the purpose of prostitution' (sec. 4 [1] [k]). These provisions were then incorporated into the Summary Offences Act 1970, s.28. = Decriminalisation = In the 1970s an active debate about the need for liberalisation appeared, spearheaded by feminists and libertarians, culminating under the Wran ALP government in the Prostitution Act 1979. Eventually NSW became a model for debates on liberalising prostitution laws. But almost immediately, community pressure started to build for additional safeguards, particularly in Darlinghurst , although police still utilised other legislation such as the Offences in Public Places Act 1979 for unruly behaviour. Eventually, this led to a subsequent partial recriminalisation of street work with the Prostitution (Amendment) Act 1983, of which s.8A stipulates that; (1) A person in a public street shall not, near a dwelling, school, church or hospital, solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution ... (2) A person shall not, in a school, church or hospital, solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution. This resulted in Darlinghurst street workers relocating. Further decriminalisation of premises followed with the implementation of recommendations from the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly Upon Prostitution (1983‚Äì86). Although the committee had recommended relaxing the soliciting laws, the new Greiner Liberal government tightened these provisions further in 1988 through the Summary Offences Act in response to community pressure. The current regulatory framework is based on the Crimes Act 1900,. Disorderly Houses Act 1943 (renamed Restricted Premises Act in 2002), Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, and Summary Offences Act 1988. The suburbs of King's Cross in Sydney and Islington in Newcastle have been traditional centres of prostitution. New South Wales is the only Australian state that legalises street prostitution. But community groups in those locations have occasionally lobbied for re-criminalisation. As promised in its 2011 election campaign, the Liberal Party sought review of the regulation of brothels. In September 2012, it issues a discussion paper on review of the regulations. It stated that the purpose was three-fold, the protection of residential amenity; protection of sex workers and safeguarding public health. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of a negative effect of brothels on the community.  Politics  Generally prostitution policy in NSW has been bipartisan. But in 2010 the Liberal (centre-right) opposition announced that it would make prostitution reform part of its campaign for the March 2011 State election. The plan would involve a new licensing authority, following revelations that the sex industry had been expanding and operating illegally as well as in legal premises. The Liberals claimed that organised crime and coercion were part of the NSW brothel scene. The last reform was in 2007, with the Brothels Legislation Act. The Liberals were duly elected as the new government in that election. Advocacy for sex workers in NSW is undertaken by SWOP NSW (Sex Workers Outreach Project).  Northern Territory  Sex work including the operation of brothels and street work became legal, subject to regulation, in the Northern Territory in 2019 with the passage of the Sex Industry Act which repealed earlier legislation.  History  Unlike other parts of Australia, the Northern Territory remained largely Aboriginal for much longer, and Europeans were predominantly male. Inevitably this brought European males into close proximity with Aboriginal women. There has been much debate as to whether the hiring of Aboriginal women (Black Velvet) as domestic labour but also as sexual partners constituted prostitution or not. Certainly these inter-racial liaisons attracted much criticism. Once the Commonwealth took over the territory from South Australia in 1911, it saw its role as protecting the indigenous population, and there was considerable debate about employment standards and the practice of 'consorting'. Pressure from reform came from women's groups such as Women Against Discrimination and Exploitation (WADE). (Bonney 1997) In 1992 the Prostitution Regulation Act reformed and consolidated the common law and statute law relating to prostitution. The first report of the Escort Agency Licensing Board in 1993 recommended further reform, but the Government did not accept this, feeling there would be widespread opposition to legalising brothels. The Attorney-General's Department conducted a review in 1996. A further review was subsequently conducted in 1998. In 2004 The Suppression of Brothels Act 1907 (SA) in its application to the Territory was repealed by the . Under this legislation brothels and street work were illegal, but The Northern Territory Licensing CommissionNorthern Territory Licensing Commission could license Northern Territory residents for a licence to operate an escort agency business.Department of Business: Escort Agency Licensing Sole operators were legal and un-regulated. Sex workers protested against the fact that the NT was the only part of Australia where workers had to register with the police.  Sex Industry Act 2019  The NT Government had consistently rejected calls for legalisation of brothels, and as elsewhere in Australia any liberalisation has been vigorously opposed by religious groups. The ALP government, elected in 2016, issued a discussion paper in March 2019. Following the consultation period in May, legislation was prepared, and introduced in September as the Sex Industry Bill. It was referred to committee on 18 September, inviting public submissions. The Economic Policy Scrutiny Committee reported on 20 November, with the Government response on the 26th. The Bill was considered and passed by the Legislative Assembly that day, effectively decriminalising prostitution in the Territory, and coming into force on 16 December 2019. The move was welcomed by the United Nations HIV/AIDS Programme (UNAIDS).  Queensland  Brothels are legal. They are licensed by the Prostitution Licensing Authority (PLA). The PLA reports to the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC), which reports to parliament. There are two types of sex work that are legal in Queensland: * Private sex work: A single sex worker working alone. It is an offence for such a worker to solicit publicly. Advertising is permitted with restrictions on the wording. * Sex work in a licensed brothel. All other forms of sex work remain illegal, including more than one worker sharing a premise, street prostitution, unlicensed brothels or massage parlours used for sex work, and outcalls from licensed brothels. The CMC continues to oppose outcall services; although this is currently favoured by the PLA. According to a 2009 report, only 10% of prostitution happens in the licensed brothels, the rest of 90% of prostitution remains either unregulated or illegal. There were 25 known legal brothels in 2009, and 75% of sex work involved outcall. There are continuing reports that an illegal sector continues to thrive. In 2012 sex workers in Queensland won the right to rent motel and hotel rooms to work, under the Anti-Discrimination Act. Economic circumstances continue to be a determinant of women seeking sex work.  History  Much emphasis was placed in colonial Queensland on the role of immigration and the indigenous population in introducing and sustaining prostitution, while organisations such as the Social Purity Society described what they interpreted as widespread female depravity. Concerns led to the Act for the Suppression of Contagious Diseases 1868 (31 Vict. No. 40), part of a widespread legislative attempt to control prostitution throughout the British Empire through incarceration in lock hospitals. Brothels were defined in section 231 of the Queensland Criminal Code in 1897, which explicitly defined 'bawdy houses' in 1901. A further act relating to venereal disease control was the Health Act Amendment Act 1911 (2 Geo. V. No. 26). Solicitation was an offence under Clause 132E, and could lead to a fine or imprisonment. Other measures included the long-standing vagrancy laws and local by-laws. The Fitzgerald Report (Commission of Inquiry into \\"Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct\\") of 1989 led to widespread concern regarding the operation of the laws, and consequently a more specific inquiry (Criminal Justice Commission. Regulating morality? An inquiry into prostitution in Queensland) in 1991. This in turn resulted in two pieces of legislation, the Prostitution Laws Amendment Act 1992 and the Prostitution Act 1999.. The Crime and Misconduct Commission reported on the regulation of prostitution in 2004, and on outcall work in 2006. Five amendments were introduced between 1999 and 2010. In August 2009 the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009 was introducedProstitution and other Acts Amendments Bill 2009. Legislative Proceedings 18 August 2009 and assented to in September, becoming the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Act 2010 proclaimed in March 2011.  South Australia  Brothels are illegal in South Australia, under the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935. and the Summary Offences Act 1953.. Soliciting in public places (maximum penalty of $750), receiving money from the prostitution of another, and procuring are illegal ($2,500 or jail for six months), but the act of prostitution itself is not.  History   Early era  Despite the intentions of the founders, prostitution became identified early in the history of the colony, known as the 'social evil', and various government reports during the nineteenth century refer to estimates of the number of people working in prostitution. In 1842, within six years of the founding of the colony, it was reported that there were now \\"large numbers of females who are living by a life of prostitution in the city of Adelaide, out of all proportion to the respectable population\\".Penney, Richard L. (Dr to Governor George Grey), cited by S. Horan 1984 The Police Act 1844. set penalties for prostitutes found in public houses or public places\\"every person who shall...knowingly permit or suffer prostitutes or persons of notoriously bad character to meet together and remain therein, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than Five Pounds\\". (s. 18. referring to Public Houses) \\"every common prostitute wandering in the public streets or highways, or in any place of public resort, and behaving in a riotous or indecent manner... shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person [and shall be liable to be committed] to the House of Correction, there to be kept to hard labor for any time not exceeding one calendar month.\\" (s. 20) This was consistent with the vagrancy laws then operating throughout the British Empire and remained the effective legislation for most of the remainder of the century, although it had little effect despite harsher penalties enacted in 1863 and 1869. Following the scandal described by WT Stead in the UK, there was much discussion of the white slave trade in Adelaide, and with the formation of the Social Purity Society of South Australia in 1882 along similar lines to that in other countries, similar legislation to the UK Criminal Law Consolidation Amendment Act 1885 was enacted, making it an offence to procure the defilement of a female by fraud or threat (the 1885 Protection of Young Persons Act). Opinions were divided as to whether to address the issue of prostitution by social reform and 'prevention', or by legislation, and many debates were held concerning the need for licensing and regulation. The twentieth century saw the Suppression of Brothels Bill 1907, the Venereal Diseases Act of 1920, the Police Act 1936 and Police Offences Act 1953.  Modern era  While current legislation is based on acts of parliament from the 1930s and 1950s, at least six unsuccessful attempts have been made to reform the laws, starting in 1980. In 1978 one of many inquires was launched. Parliament voted a select committee of inquiry in August, renewed following the 1979 election. The Evidence Act 1978 was amended to allow witness immunity. = Millhouse (1980) = The committee report (1980) recommended decriminalisation. Robin Millhouse's (former Liberal Attorney-General, but then a new LM and finally Democrat MLA) introduced (27 February 1980) a bill entitled \\"A Bill for an Act to give effect to the recommendations of the Select Committee of Inquiry into prostitution.\\" It generated considerable opposition in the community and failed on a tied vote in the Assembly on 11 February 1981. = Pickles (1986) = A further bill was introduced in 1986 (Carolyn Pickles ALP MLC 1985‚Äì2002) but dropped on 18 March 1987 due to Liberal opposition and community pressure, with a 13‚Äì2 vote. = Gilfillan (1991) = A number of issues kept sex work in the public eye during 1990 and 1991. The next development occurred on 8 February 1991 when Ian Gilfillan (Australian Democrat MLC 1982-3) stated he would introduce a decriminalisation private members bill. He did so on 10 April 1991 but it met opposition from groups such as the Uniting Church and it lapsed when parliament recessed for the winter. Although he introduced a similar bill on 21 August 1991 but on 29 April 1992 a motion passed that resulted in the bill being withdrawn in favour of a reference to the Social Development Committee, although little was achieved by the latter during this time. = Brindal (1993) = Another bill came in 1993 and then Mark Brindal, a Liberal backbencher, produced a discussion paper on decriminalisation in November 1994, and on 9 February 1995 he introduced a private member's bill (Prostitution (Decriminalisation) Bill) to decriminalise prostitution and the Prostitution Regulation Bill on 23 February. He had been considered to have a better chance of success than the previous initiatives due to a \\"sunrise clause\\" which would set a time frame for a parliamentary debate prior to it coming into effect. He twice attempted to get decriminalisation bills passed, although his party opposed this. The Decriminalisation Bill was discharged on 6 July, and the Regulation Bill was defeated on 17 July. = Cameron (1998) = Meanwhile, the Committee released its final report on 21 August 1996,Report of the Inquiry into Prostitution (SA) but it was not till 25 March 1998 that Terry Cameron MLC (ALP 1995‚Äì2006) introduced a bill based on it. It had little support and lapsed when parliament recessed. = Brokenshire (1999) = The Liberal Police Minister, Robert Brokenshire, introduced four Bills in 1999, the Prostitution (Licensing) Bill 1999, the Prostitution (Registration) Bill 1999, the Prostitution (Regulation) Bill 1999 and the Summary Offences (Prostitution) Bill 1999, to revise the laws and decriminalise prostitution. The Prostitution (Regulation) Bill was passed by the House of Assembly and received by the Legislative Council on 13 July 2000, but defeated on 17 July 2001, 12:7. The Bill was also supported by the Australian Democrats.Hon Sandra Knack. Speech Legislative Council 10 October 2000 The then Minister for the status of Women, Diana Laidlaw is said to have been moved to tears, and called her colleagues \\"gutless\\". Another MLC, Sandra Kanck (Australian Democrat 1993‚Äì2009) angrily stated that sex workers had been \\"thrown to the wolves by Parliament\\". = Key-Gago (2012‚Äì13) = No further attempts to reform the law were been made for some time, however in 2010 a governing Labor backbencher and former minister, Stephanie Key, announced she would introduce a private members decriminalisation bill. Religious groups immediately organised opposition, although the opposition Liberals promised to consider it. Consultations with the blackmarket industry continued and in June 2011 she outlined her intended legislation to amend the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 and the Summary Offences Act 1953 to ensure sex workers had the same industrial rights and responsibilities as other workers, that minors under the age of 18 years were not involved in or associated with sex work, preventing sex services premises from being established within 200 metres of schools, centres for children or places of worship, allowing local government to regulate public amenity, noise, signage and location in relation to sex services premises with more than three workers, promote safe sex education and practice by clients and sex workers, and enable sex workers to report criminal matters to the police like in a similar matter to other citizens, but not where workers could report victims of abuse for intervention assistance or men who sought out such young women as potential rapists or pedophiles. She presented her proposals to the Caucus in September 2011, and tabled a motion on 24 November 2011 \\"That she have leave to introduce a Bill for an Act to decriminalise prostitution and regulate the sex work industry; to amend the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935, the Equal Opportunity Act 1984, the Fair Work Act 1994, the Summary Offences Act 1953 and the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986; and for other purpose\\". The proposal was opposed by the Family First Party that had ten per cent of the votes in the Legislative Council, where Robert Brokenshire now opposed decriminalisation. However Police Commissioner, Mal Hyde, stated that the laws need to change. After considerable discussion and some compromises the Sex Work Reform Bill was introduced in May 2012, but was defeated by one vote, 20 to 19 in a conscience vote on second reading in November 2012. Status of Women Minister Gail Gago introduced a similar bill in the Legislative Council, but withdrew it following the defeat of Stephanie Key's Bill. Key introduced another BillStatutes Amendment (Decriminalisation of Sex Work) Bill 2013 in May 2013. = Lensink-Key-Chapman-Franks (2015-2019) = On 1 July 2015 Michelle Lensink Liberal MLC introduced an updated version of the Key-Gago legislation as a Private Member's Bill to the South Australian Legislative Council (53rd Parliament), the Statutes Amendment (Decriminalisation of Sex Work) Bill (LC44). Key and Lensink collaborated across party lines to develop the legislation, sexual exploitation being the obvious potential in an industry like this, and its introduction to the Legislative Council was intended to test key elements of the legislation with important opponents in the upper house. The Bill passed the upper house on 6 July 2017 but did not proceed past a second reading on 19 October 2017 in the Assembly, due to prorogation prior to the election the following March, which led to a change of government. The Bill sought to decriminalise sex work by a number of legislative amendments. It would delete the term \\"common prostitute\\" from the Criminal Law Consolidation Act (1935) and Summary Offences Act (1953). In addition it would remove common law offences relating to sex work and add \\"sex work\\" to the Equal Opportunity Act making discrimination against a person for being a sex worker an offence. Criminal records relating to sex work, including brothels, would be deleted by amending the Spent Convictions Act. The Return to Work Act would be amended to recognise commercial sexual services as in any other business. Sex workers would also be covered under the Work Health and Safety Act A further attempt to introduce the same Bill (Decriminalisation of Sex Work Bill LC2) was made on 9 May 2018 (54th Parliament), also as a private member's bill sponsored by the Attorney-General Vickie Chapman and Tammy Franks MLC (Greens), and with the support of Liberal Premier Steven Marshall. Statistics published at the time showed that only four people had been fined for offering prostitution services in public between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2019. In that period, 57 fines for other sex work offences, mainly for managing a brothel or receiving money in a brothel. The bill was again passed in the Legislative Council on 20 June 2019, but this time was defeated in the Assembly 24 to 19 on 13 November 2019 on a conscience vote on second reading. This was the thirteenth bill to fail over a 20-year time period.  Tasmania  Prostitution is legal, but it is illegal for a person to employ or otherwise control or profit from the work of individual sex workers. The Sex Industry Offences Act 2005. states that a person must not be a commercial operator of a sexual services business ‚Äì that is, \\"someone who is not a self- employed sex worker and who, whether alone or with another person, operates, owns, manages or is in day-to-day control of a sexual services business\\". Street prostitution is illegal. This law explicitly outlines that it is illegal to assault a sex worker, to receive commercial sexual services, or provide or receive sexual services unless a prophylactic is used.  History  Prostitution has existed in Tasmania (known as Van Diemen's Land prior to 1856) since its early days as a penal colony, when large numbers of convict women started arriving in the 1820s. Some of the women who were transported there already had criminal records related to prostitution, but most were labelled as such, despite it not being either illegal or grounds for deportation. Prostitution was not so much a profession as a way of life for some women to make ends meet, particularly in a society in which there was a marked imbalance of gender, and convict women had no other means of income. Certainly brothels were established by the end of the 1820s, and records show girls as young as 12 were involved, while prostitution was associated with the female factory at Cascades. Nevertheless, the concept of 'fallen women' and division of women into 'good' and 'bad' was well established. In an attempt to produce some law and order the Vagrancy Act 1824 was introduced. The Van Diemen's Land Asylum for the Protection of Destitute and Unfortunate Females (1848) was the first establishment for women so designated. Other attempts were the Penitent's Homes and Magdalen Asylums as rescue missions. In 1879 like other British colonies, Tasmania passed a Contagious Diseases Act (based on similar UK legislation of the 1860s), and established Lock Hospitals in an attempt to prevent venereal diseases amongst the armed forces, at the instigation of the Royal Navy. The Act ceased to operate in 1903 in the face of repeal movements. However, there was little attempt to suppress prostitution itself. What action there was against prostitution was mainly to keep it out of the public eye, using vagrancy laws. Otherwise the police ignored or colluded with prostitution.  Twentieth century  More specific legislation dates from the early twentieth century, such as the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Crimes against Morality), and the Police Offences Act 1935.. Efforts to reform legislation that was clearly ineffective began in the 1990s. Prior to the 2005 Act, soliciting by a prostitute, living on the earnings of a prostitute, keeping a disorderly house and letting a house to a tenant to use as a disorderly house were criminal offences. Sole workers and escort work, which was the main form of prostitution in the stat, were legal in Tasmania. Reform was suggested by a government committee in 1999. In December 2002 Cabinet agreed to the drafting of legislation and in September 2003, approved the release of the draft Sex Industry Regulation Bill for consultation. The Bill proposed registration for operators of sexual services businesses. Consultation with agencies, local government, interested persons and organisations occurred during 2004, resulting in the Sex Industry Regulation Bill 2004 being tabled in Parliament in June 2005. The Bill was supported by sex workers, The Bill included offence provisions to ensure that Tasmania met its international obligations under the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (signed by Australia in 2001.) It passed the House of Assembly and was tabled in the Legislative Council, where it was soon clear that it would not be passed, and was subsequently lost. It was replaced by the Sex Industry Offences Act 2005. Essentially, in response to protests the Government moved from a position of liberalising to one of further criminalising. The Act that was passed consolidated and clarified the existing law in relation to sex work by providing that it was legal to be a sex worker and provide sexual services but that it was illegal for a person to employ or otherwise control or profit from the work of individual sex workers. A review clause was included because of the uncertainty as to what the right way to proceed was. The Act commenced 1 January 2006.  2008 review  In 2008, the Justice Department conducted a review of the 2005 Act and received a number of submissions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The report was tabled in June 2009 and expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the legislation, and suggested considering alternatives. In June 2010, the Attorney-General Lara Giddings announced the Government was going to proceed with reform, using former Attorney-General Judy Jackson's 2003 draft legislation as a starting point. Giddings became the Premier in a minority ALP government in January 2011. However, her Attorney-general, former premier David Bartlett, did not favour this position but resigned shortly afterwards, being succeeded by Brian Wightman.  2012 review  Wightman released a discussion paper in January 2012. This was opposed by religious conservative groups, some feminist groups as well as community organisations with concerns about the potential a legalised sex industry to bring organised crime to the state, and included presentations from other States such as Sheila Jeffreys. The government invited submissions on the discussion paper until the end of March, and received responses from a wide range of individuals and groups. Wightman declined to refer the matter to the Law Reform Institute.Opinions sought on sex law reforms. Lawgovpol 13 March 2012 After the review Wightman stated that there were no plans to make prostitution illegal \\"Legal issues around the sex industry can be emotive and personal for many people... The Government's top priority is the health and safety of sex workers and the Tasmanian community.\\"  Victoria   History  Victoria has a long history of debating prostitution, and was the first State to advocate regulation (as opposed to decriminalisation in New South Wales) rather than suppression of prostitution. Legislative approaches and public opinion in Victoria have gradually moved from advocating prohibition to control through regulation. While much of the activities surrounding prostitution were initially criminalised de jure, de facto the situation was one of toleration and containment of 'a necessary evil'.  19th century  Laws against prostitution existed from the founding of the State in 1851. The Vagrant Act 1852. included prostitution as riotous and indecent behaviour carrying a penalty of imprisonment for up to 12 months with the possibility of hard labour (Part II, s 3).Any habitual Drunkard having been thrice convicted of drunkenness within the preceding twelve months and any common Prostitute who in any Street or public Highway or being in any place of public Resort shall behave in a riotous or indecent manner....shall be liable to imprisonment in any Gaol or House of Correction in the said Colony for any time not exceeding twelve months with or without hard labour. The Conservation of Public Health Act 1878. required detention and medical examination of women suspected of being prostitutes, 4\\\\. Upon complaint made on oath by a sergeant of police or by an officer of a higher rank in the police force that a female is or is reputed to be a common prostitute or has within fourteen days prior to the making of such complaint solicited prostitution and that he has been informed and has reason to believe that she is suffering from the disease a police magistrate may by notice in the form set forth in the First Schedule hereto or to the like effect require such female to appear before him and prove by the evidence of some legally qualified medical practitioner that she is free from the disease corresponding to the Contagious Diseases Acts in other parts of the British Empire. This Act was not repealed till 1916, but was relatively ineffective either in controlling venereal diseases or prostitution. The Crimes Act 1891 included specific prohibitions under PART II.‚ÄîSuppression of Prostitution Sections 14‚Äì21. Procurement (ss 14‚Äì17) or detention (ss 18‚Äì21) of women either through inducements or violence to work as prostitutes was prohibited, with particular reference to underage girls. The Police Offences Act 1891. separated riotous and indecent behaviour from prostitution, making it a specific offence for a prostitute to 'importune' a person in public (s 7(2)).(2) Every common prostitute who importunes any person passing in any public street thoroughfare or place or within the view or hearing of any person passing therein‚Äîshall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five pounds or to imprisonment for any period not exceeding one month. Despite the laws, prostitution flourished, the block of Melbourne bounded by La Trobe Street, Spring Street, Lonsdale Street and Exhibition Street being the main red light district, and their madams were well known. An attempt at suppression in 1898 was ineffectual.  Early 20th century  The Police offences Act 1907. prohibited 'brothel keeping', leasing a premise for the purpose of a brothel, and living off prostitution (ss 5, 6). Despite a number of additional legislative responses in the early years of the century, enforcement was patchy at best. Eventually amongst drug use scandals, brothels were shut down in the 1930s. All of these laws were explicitly directed against women, other than living on the avails. In the 1970s brothels evaded prohibition by operating as 'massage parlours', leading to pressure to regulate them, since public attitudes were moving more towards regulation rather than prohibition. Initial attempts involved planning laws, when in 1975 the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme allowed for the operation of these parlours, even though they were known to be brothels, indeed the approval process required assurances that they would not be operated as such but this was not enforced. Community concerns were loudest in the traditional Melbourne stroll area of St. Kilda.  Late 20th century: From prohibition to regulation  A Working Party was assembled in 1984 and led to the Planning (Brothel) Act 1984, as a new approach. Part of the political bargaining involved in passing the act was the promise to set up a wider inquiry. The inquiry was chaired by Marcia Neave, and reported in 1985. The recommendations to allow brothels to operate legally under regulation tried to avoid some of the issues that arose in New South Wales in 1979. It was hoped that regulation would allow better control of prostitution and at the same time reduce street work. The Government attempted to implement these in the Prostitution Regulation Act 1986. However, as in other States, the bill ran into considerable opposition in the upper house, was extensively amended, and consequently many parts were not proclaimed. This created an incoherent patchwork approach. Regulatory framework In 1992 a working group was set up by the Attorney-General, which resulted in the Prostitution Control Act 1994 (PCA) (now known as the Sex Work Act 1994.) This Act legalises and regulates the operations of brothels and escort agencies in Victoria. The difference between the two is that in the case of a brothel clients come to the place of business, which is subject to local council planning controls. In the case of an escort agency, clients phone the agency and arrange for a sex worker to come to their homes or motels. A brothel must obtain a permit from the local council (Section 21A). A brothel or escort agency must not advertise its services. (Section 18) Also, a brothel operator must not allow alcohol to be consumed at the brothel, (Section 21) nor apply for a liquor licence for the premises; nor may they allow a person under the age of 18 years to enter a brothel nor employ as a sex worker a person under 18 years of age, (Section 11A) though the age of consent in Victoria is 16 years.. Owner-operated brothels and private escort workers are not required to obtain a licence, but must be registered, and escorts from brothels are permitted. If only one or two sex workers run a brothel or escort agency, which does not employ other sex workers, they also do not need a licence, but are required to be registered. However, in all other cases, the operator of a brothel or escort agency must be licensed. The licensing process enables the licensing authority to check on any criminal history of an applicant. All new brothels are limited to having no more than six rooms. However, larger brothels which existed before the Act was passed were automatically given licences and continue to operate, though cannot increase the number of rooms. Sex workers employed by licensed brothels are not required to be licensed or registered.Consumer Affairs Victoria ‚Äì Proposed Prostitution Control Regulations 2006 , p8. A person under 18 years is not permitted to be a sex worker (sections 5‚Äì7), and sex work must not be forced (section 8) Amending Acts were passed in 1997 and 1999, and a report on the state of sex work in Victoria issued in 2002. More substantial amendments followed in 2008. The Consumer Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 2010 came into effect in November 2010. 'Prostitution' was replaced by 'Sex Work' throughout. The Act is now referred to as the Sex Work Act 1994. In 2011 further amendments were introduced, and assented to in December 2011. In addition to the Sex Work Act 1994, it amends the Confiscation Act 1997 and the Confiscation Amendment Act 2010. The stated purposes of the Act is to assign and clarify responsibility for the monitoring, investigation and enforcement of provisions of the Sex Work Act; to continue the ban on street prostitution. Criticism of the effects of legislation In 1984 a Labor government legalised prostitution in Victoria and in their 2001 paper, \\"Legalising Prostitution Is Not The Answer: The Example Of Victoria, Australia\\", authors Jeffries and Mary Sullivan explained the legislative shift: \\"The prohibition of prostitution was seen to be ineffective against a highly visible massage parlour trade (a euphemism for brothels), increasing street prostitution, criminal involvement and drug use.\\" The authors used the term \\"harm minimization\\" to describe the objective of the government at the time. When the oppositional Coalition government was elected in 1992 it decided to retain the legislation. Sullivan and Jeffries also wrote in the 2001 report that the legislation change of 1984 created new problems: > Ongoing adjustments to legislation became necessary as state policy makers > attempted to deal with a myriad of unforeseen issues that are not addressed > by treating prostitution as commercial sex‚Äîchild prostitution, trafficking > of women, the exploitation and abuse of prostituted women by big business. Furthermore, according to Sullivan and Jeffries: *The legislation was designed to control the expansion of the sex industry, but instead, a \\"massive expansion\\" consequently occurred. *The increased safety that was intended as an outcome did not eventuate, as the authors define sex work as \\"commercial sexual violence\\" (They refer to Evelina Giobbe, Director of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation Resource Institute, who argues that \\"prostitution is violence in and of itself\\".) and state that street-based sex workers \\"still suffer extreme violence on the streets\\". *The aim to eliminate organised crime from the sex industry failed, as \\"Convicted criminals, fronted by supposedly more reputable people, remain in the business.\\" The authors referred to a national study, conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology, that estimated that Australian brothels earned A$1 million a week from illegal trading, while claiming, without a corresponding citation, that Victorians involved in the sex industry at the time were connected to crime syndicates worth A$30 million in Australia.  Current situation  Premises-based sex work In November 2005, 95 licensed brothels existed in Victoria and a total of 2007 small owner-operators were registered in the state (Of these, 2003 were escort agents, two were brothels, and two were combined brothels and escort agents.) Of the 95 licensed brothels, 505 rooms existed and four rooms were located in small exempt brothels. Of 157 licensed prostitution service providers (i.e. operators), 47 were brothels, 23 were escort agencies and 87 were combined brothel-escort agencies. In March 2011, government data showed the existence of 98 licensed brothels in Victoria. Based on the statements of William Albon, a representative of the Australian Adult Entertainment Industry (AAEI) (formerly the Australian Adult Entertainment Association (AAEA)), the number of illegal brothels in Victoria was estimated as 400 in 2008, with this estimation rising to 7,000 in 2011. In 2011 News.com.au published an estimate of 400 illegal brothels in the Melbourne metropolitan area‚Äîthe article cited the news outlet's engagement with the Victorian State Government's Business Licensing Authority (BLA), the body responsible for registering owner-operated sex work businesses, but does not clarify from where or whom it obtained the estimate. However, a 2006 study conducted by the University of Melbourne, Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and Victoria's Alfred Hospital, concluded that \\"The number of unlicensed brothels in Melbourne is much smaller than is generally believed.\\" The study's results presented an estimate of between 13 and 70 unlicensed brothels in Melbourne, and the method used by the researchers involved a systematically analysis of the language used in advertisements from Melbourne newspapers published in July 2006 to identify sex industry venues that were indicated a likelihood of being unlicensed. A total of 438 advertisements, representing 174 separate establishments, were analysed. Street sex work As of April 2014, street prostitution continues to be illegal in the state of Victoria and the most recent review process of the legislation in terms of street-based sex work occurred at the beginning of the 21st century and a final report was published by the Attorney General's Street Prostitution Advisory Group. However, the advisory group, founded in March 2001 by the Attorney-General at the time, Rob Hulls, solely examined the issues pertaining to the Port Phillip Local Government Area (LGA), as the suburb of St. Kilda, located in the City of Port Phillip, is a metropolitan location in which a significant level of street prostitution occurred‚Äîthis remained the case in 2010. The Advisory Group consisted of residents, traders, street-based sex workers, welfare agencies, the City of Port Phillip, the State Government and Victoria Police, and released the final report after a 12-month period. The Executive Summary of the report states: > The Advisory Group seeks to use law enforcement strategies to manage and, > where possible, reduce street sex work in the City of Port Phillip to the > greatest extent possible, while providing support and protection for > residents, traders and workers. It proposes a harm minimisation approach to > create opportunities for street sex workers to leave the industry and > establish arrangements under which street sex work can be conducted without > workers and residents suffering violence and abuse ... A two-year trial of > tolerance areas and the establishment of street worker centres represents > the foundation of the package proposed by the Advisory Group. Tolerance > areas would provide defined geographic zones in which clients could pick-up > street sex workers. The areas would be selected following rigorous scrutiny > of appropriate locations by the City of Port Phillip, and a comprehensive > process of community consultation. Tolerance areas would be created as a > Local Priority Policing initiative and enshrined in an accord. Ongoing > monitoring would be undertaken by the City of Port Phillip Local Safety > Committee. The concluding chapter of the report is entitled \\"The Way Forward\\" and lists four recommendations that were devised in light of the publication of the report. The four recommendations are listed as: a transparent process; an implementation plan; a community consultation; and the completion of an evaluation. The June 2010 Victorian Recommendations of the Drug and Crime Prevention Committee were released nearly a decade later and, according to SA: > ... if implemented, will criminalise, marginalise and further hurt migrant > and non- migrant sex workers in Victoria; a group who already face the most > overbearing regulatory structures and health policies pertaining to sex > workers in Australia, and enjoy occupational health and safety worse than > that of their criminalised colleagues (Western Australia) and far behind > those in a decriminalised setting (New South Wales). Alongside numerous other organisations and individuals, SA released its response to the recommendations of the Committee that were divided into two sections: 1. Opposition to all of the recommendations of the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry 2. Recommendations from the Victorian Parliamentary Committee to the Commonwealth Government. The list of organisations in support of SA's response included Empower Foundation, Thailand; COSWAS, Collective of Sex Workers and Supporters, Taiwan; TAMPEP (European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers); Sex Workers Outreach Project USA; Maria McMahon, Former Manager Sex Workers Outreach Project NSW and Sex Services Planning Advisory Panel, NSW Government; and Christine Harcourt, Researcher, Law & Sex Worker Health Project (LASH) for the University of NSW National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research and Faculty of Law and University of Melbourne Sexual Health Unit School of Population Health. HIV In terms of HIV, a 2010 journal article by the Scarlet Alliance (SA) organisation‚Äîbased on research conducted in 2008‚Äîexplained that it is illegal for a HIV-positive sex worker to engage in sex work in Victoria; although, it is not illegal for a HIV-positive client to hire the services of sex workers. Additionally, according to the exact wording of the SA document, \\"It is not a legal requirement to disclose HIV status prior to sexual intercourse; however, it is an offence to intentionally or recklessly infect someone with HIV.\\"  Economics and gender  In a 2005 study Mary Sullivan of the CATWSullivan, Mary. What Happens When Prostitution Becomes Work? An Update on Legalisation of Prostitution in Australia. Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, Australia 2005 stated that prostitution businesses made revenues of A$1,780 million in 2004/5 and the sex industry is growing at a rate of 4.6% annually (a rate higher than GDP). In the state of Victoria, there are 3.1 million instances of buying sex per year as compared with a total male population of 1.3 million men. She stated that women make up 90% of the labour force in the industry in Victoria and earn, on average, A$400‚Äì$500 per week, do not receive holiday or sick pay, and work on average four 10-hour shifts per week. According to her report, there has been an overall growth in the industry since legalisation in the mid-1980s and that with increased competition between prostitution businesses, earnings have decreased; 20 years ago there were 3000 to 4000 women in prostitution as a whole, as of the report, there were 4500 women in the legal trade alone and the illegal trade was estimated to be 4 to 5 times larger. Sullivan's study states that the sex industry is run by six large companies, which tend to control a wide array of prostitution operations, making self-employment very difficult; brothels take 50% to 60% of the money paid by clients and fine workers for refusing them. These legal businesses are commonly used by criminal elements as a front to launder money from human trafficking, underage prostitution, and other illicit enterprises. Between 1995 and 1998, the Prostitution Control Board, a state government body, collected $991,000 Australian in prostitution licensing fees. In addition, hoteliers, casinos, taxi drivers, clothing manufacturers and retailers, newspapers, advertising agencies, and other logically-related businesses profit from prostitution in the state. One prostitution business in Australia is publicly traded on the Australian stock exchange. Sullivan's claims have been widely disputed.  Western Australia  Like other Australian states, Western Australia has had a long history of debates and attempts to reform prostitution laws. In the absence of reform, varying degrees of toleration have existed. The current legislation is the Prostitution Act 2000, with some offences under the Criminal Code, Health Act 1911 (addressing venereal diseases) and the Liquor Control Act 1988 (prohibiting a prostitute from being on licensed premises). Prostitution itself is legal, but many activities associated with it, such as pimping and running brothels, are illegal. Despite the fact that brothels are illegal, the state has a long history of tolerating and unofficially regulating them. Street offences are addressed in Ss. 5 and 6 of the Prostitution Act, while brothels are prohibited (including living on the earnings) under S. 190 of the Criminal Code (2004). Procuring is covered under both acts. Asian workers form a significant section of the workforce and experience a disproportionate amount of social and health problems.  History   Early period  Legislation addressing prostitution in Western Australia dates from the introduction of English law in 1829, specifically prohibiting bawdy houses (Interpretation Act). Prostitution in Western Australia has been intimately tied to the history of gold mining. In these areas a quasi-official arrangement existed between premise owners and the authorities. This was frequently justified as a harm reduction measure. Like other Australian colonies, legislation tended to be influenced by developments in Britain. The Police Act 1892 was no different, establishing penalties for soliciting or vagrancy, while the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1892 dealt with procurement. Brothel keepers were prosecuted under the Municipal Institutions Act 1895, by which all municipalities had passed brothel suppression by-laws by 1905.  Twentieth century  Laws were further strengthened by the Police Act Amendment Act 1902, and Criminal Code 1902. Despite this the brothels of Kalgoorlie were legendary. Prostitution was much debated in the media and parliament, but despite much lobbying, venereal diseases were not included in the Health Act 1911. Prostitution was also dealt with by the Criminal Code 1913. The war years and the large number of military personnel in Perth and Fremantle concentrated attention on the issue, however during much of Western Australian history, control of prostitution was largely a police affair rather than a parliamentary one, as a process of \\"containment\\", in which brothels were tolerated in exchange for a level of cooperation. Consequently, the names and addresses of prostitutes remain recorded in the official records. This policy originated in Kalgoorlie, and later appeared in Perth The informal containment policy, dating from 1900, was replaced by a more formal one in 1975. Containment was ended by the police in 2000, leaving brothels largely unregulated. Approaches reflected the ideology of the particular ruling party, as an attempt was made to replace \\"containment\\" and make control a specific parliamentary responsibility. There was further legislative activity in the 1980s and 1990s with the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1988 Pt. 2, Law Reform (Decriminalization Of Sodomy) Act 1989, Acts Amendment (Evidence) Act 1991, and the Criminal Law Amendment Act (No 2) 1992. The Criminal Code (s.190, s.191) made managing premises for the purpose of prostitution, living off the earnings of prostitution, or procuring a person for prostitution an offence. Reform was suggested in 1997, with the formation of a working group, and a Prostitution Control Bill was drafted in 1999 but not enacted till the Prostitution Act 2000. The latter dealt principally with street soliciting, offences involving children in relation to prostitution, advertising and sponsorship. = Gallop Government (2001‚Äì2006) = Under the new Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government of Geoff Gallop, elected in 2001, several prostitution Bills were introduced. In November 2002, Police Minister Michelle Roberts introduced the Prostitution Control Bill 2002 as a Green Bill (for public discussion). Following submissions, a Bill (Prostitution Control Bill 2003) was introduced in April 2003. The latter was a bill to decriminalise prostitution, regulate brothels, introduce a licensing system and establish a Prostitution Control Board. The bill was described as a \\"social control model\\" and widely criticised. It lacked sufficient support in the upper house, and eventually lapsed on 23 January 2005 on prorogation for the February election, at which the Government was returned. During this time, offences under the Police Act 1892 were repealed by passage of the Criminal Law Amendment (Simple Offences) Act 2004 and the Criminal Investigation (Consequential Provisions) Act 2006, transferring these offences to the Criminal Code. = Carpenter Government (2006‚Äì2008) = Much of the debate on the subject under this government centred on the Prostitution Amendment Act 2008,. introduced in 2007 by Alan Carpenter's ALP Government. As a background, a working party was formed in 2006, reporting the following year. Although the resulting legislation passed the upper house narrowly and received Royal Assent on 14 April 2008, it was not proclaimed before the 2008 state election, in which Carpenter and the ALP narrowly lost power in September, and therefore remained inactive, the incoming Coalition Government having vowed to repeal it in its Plan for the First 100 Days of Government. The Act was based partly on the approach taken in 2003 in New Zealand (and which in turn was based on the approach in NSW). It would have decriminalised brothels and would have required certification (certification would not have applied to independent operators). Therefore, the 2000 Act continued to be in force. Brothels existed in a legal grey area, although 'containment' had officially been disbanded, in Perth in 1958 and subsequently in Kalgoorlie. = Barnett Government (2008‚Äì2017) = In opposition the ALP criticised the lack of action on prostitution by the coalition government. The debate had been reopened when the Liberal-National Barnett Government announced plans to regulate brothels in December 2009. More information was announced by Attorney-General Christian Porter in June 2010. Religious groups continued to oppose any liberalisation, as did elements within the government party although Porter denied this. His critics stated that Porter \\"would accommodate the market demand for prostitution by setting up a system of licensed brothels in certain non- residential areas\\" and that people \\"should accept that prostitution will occur and legalise the trade, because we can never suppress it entirely\\" and that it is \\"like alcohol or gambling ‚Äì saying it should be regulated rather than banned.\\" Porter challenged his critics to come up with a better model and rejected the Swedish example of only criminalising clients. These represent a change in thinking since an interview he gave in March 2009. However he followed through on a promise he made in early 2009 to clear the suburbs of sex work. Porter released a ministerial statement and made a speech in the legislature on 25 November 2010, inviting public submissions. The plan was immediately rejected by religious groups.Christian Lobby says WA prostitution laws do not go far enough. Family Directory 23 December 2010 By the time the consultation closed on 11 February 2011, 164 submissions were received, many repeating many of the arguments of the preceding years. One major submission was a comprehensive review of prostitution in Western Australia by a team from the University of NSW. This time Porter found himself criticised by both sides of the 2007 debate, for instance churches that supported the Coalition position in opposition, now criticised them, while sex worker groups that supported the Carpenter proposals continued to oppose coalition policies, as did health groups.  Prostitution Bill 2011  On 14 June 2011 the Minister made a \\"Green Bill\\" (draft legislation) available for public comment over a six-week period. Porter explained the purpose of the legislation thus: \\"The Prostitution Bill 2011 will not only ban brothels from residential areas but also ensure appropriate regulatory and licensing schemes are in place for those very limited non-residential areas where prostitution will be permitted and heavily regulated.\\" A FAQ sheet was also developed.Prostitution Bill 2011 FAQs Publication of the Bill did not shift the debate‚Äîwhich remained deeply polarised, with any legalisation bitterly opposed by conservative religious groups‚Äîdespite Porter's assurances that his government did not condone sex work. Sex Workers and health organisations remained just as committed to opposing the proposals. Following consultation, the government announced a series of changes to the bill that represented compromises with its critics, and the changes were then introduced into parliament on 3 November 2011, where it received a first and second reading. Sex workers continued to stand in opposition. Significantly, the opposition Labor Party opposed the bill, both political parties agreeing on the need to decriminalise the indoor market, but differing in approach. Since the government was in a minority, it required the support of several independent members to ensure passage through the Legislative Assembly. In practice, it proved difficult to muster sufficient public support, and the Bill did not attract sufficient support in parliament either. Porter left State politics in June 2012, being succeeded by Michael Mischin. Mischin admitted it would be unlikely that the bill would pass in that session. This proved to be true, as the legislature was prorogued on 30 January 2013, pending the general election on 9 March, and thus all bills lapsed. The Barnett government was returned in that election with a clear majority, but stated it would not reintroduce the previous bill and that the subject was a low priority. Meanwhile, sex workers continued to push for decriminalisation. A division exists within the government party, with some members such as Nick Goiran threatening 'civil war'. = McGowan Government (2017‚Äì) = In the election campaign of 2017, prostitution law reform was among the topics debated, and the Barnett government defeated with a return to power of the ALP. Public discussion of reform has continued since, with lobbying on both sides of the question, while a further review of the industry, following up on the 2010 (LASH) report, continued to recommend decriminalisation (The Law and Sex worker Health, LASH reports). Overseas territories Christmas Island Christmas Island is a former British colony, which was administered as part of the Colony of Singapore. The laws of Singapore, including prostitution law, were based on British law. In 1958, the sovereignty of the island was transferred to Australia. The ‚Äòlaws of the Colony of Singapore‚Äô continued to be the law of the territory. The Territories Law Reform Act 1992 decreed that Australian federal law and the state laws of Western Australia be applicable to the Indian Ocean Territories, of which Christmas Island is a part. For the current situation see Western Australia. Cocos (Keeling) Islands Cocos (Keeling) Islands were, like Christmas Island, a British colony and part of the Colony of Singapore. After transfer of sovereignty to Australia in 1955, Singapore's colonial law was still in force on the islands until 1992. The Territories Law Reform Act 1992 made Australian federal law and the state laws of Western Australia applicable to the islands. For the current situation see Western Australia. Norfolk Island Previously a self-governing Australian territory, the Norfolk Island Applied Laws Ordinance 2016 applied Australian federal law and the state laws of New South Wales to Norfolk Island.

Following a redrawing of local boundaries which took effect on 31 December 2001, the municipality includes two additional settlements, and therefore now includes Plessa-S√ºd, D√∂llingen and Kahla.StBA: √Ñnderungen bei den Gemeinden Deutschlands, see under 2001 History The first surviving record of Plessa appears in the 1406 \\"Landbethe zu Hayn\\", where a total area of slightly more than 24 Oxgangs is recorded. The name \\"Ples(o)\\" comes from an old Sorbian word for a lake, and probably refers to backwaters of the Black Elster River, now to an extent channelled, but which in the fifteenth century, with numerous small tributaries meandered through the area. Taxes were paid to the Elsterwerda Castle, home to the lords who owned the land. The earliest record of a simple unadorned wooden chapel appears in 1540, at this stage without any cross or candle sticks for the altar. Preaching at this time would still have taken place in Sorbian. In 1792 a stone church was built, but on 25 October 1811 the village, still mostly comprising timber buildings, was struck by a major fire which only four farmsteads survived. Beside the church the adjacent school house was also badly damaged. The present church was erected in 1814, with an organ installed in 1818. The Oberlausitzer Railway. running from Kohlfurt to Falkenberg, opened in 1874, crossing Plessa, but initially there was no provision for the trains to stop, following opposition to railway development from local farmers who had refused to provide land for a larger line which would open the next year linking Berlin with Dresden. Nevertheless, industrialisation soon began, and Plessa received its own stop on the railway line in 1885, with a station building following in 1891. Shortly after that, in 1894, the \\"Agnes\\" Brown-coal mine opened, which led to the establishment in 1897 of the \\"Plessaer Braunkohlenwerke GmbH\\" (Plessau Brown-coal company). In 1901 a Briquette factory opened to the north of the railway line. Brown-coal provided a basis for a more general increase in economic activity and the village began to grow, the registered population increasing from 1,200 to 2,063 between 1890 and 1910. The briquette factory developed a side-line in electricity generation, providing a local power network to which 12 electric motors and almost 400 electric lights were connected. The mine director, a man called Friedrich von Delius, nurtured ambitions for the business of power generation and in 1927, after a nine-month construction period, a full-scale power station operated from (and by) the briquette factory came online. The Second World War cost Plessa 391 dead. The worst days were the 24th and 25 April 1945, when the Red Army broke through. Plessa was identified by the invaders as a \\"Partisanendorf\\" (Partisan village): 724 buildings were burned down and 155 villagers died.Der Russe kommt. ‚ÄûKulturzeit extra: Plessa. Partisanendorf‚Äú , a 3sat documentation, August 2009 (in German). After the war the briquette factory and other industrial businesses were nationalised in 1950, shortly after the formal establishment of the German Democratic Republic. By this time the population of Plessa had increased to 3,423. In the next few years the land that had yielded up its lignite on the western side of the Plessa Heath was planted with fruit orchards. The most successful crop came from the sweet cherry trees which are able to tolerate relatively poor soil quality. On 1 January 1957 Plessa-S√ºd (previously known as Gr√∂dener Schraden) was incorporated into Plessa. A serious accident took place in 1983 at the Plessa Briquette factory when a coal gas explosion caused several deaths and left many injured. Local government reorganization followed two years after reunification in 1992, and Plessa became the centre of the Plessa collective municipality, incorporating seven individually small municipalities. In 1998 the power station became a project of the \\"F√ºrst- P√ºckler-Land\\" regional redevelopment programme.

Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it is the first major installment in the SimCity series since the release of SimCity 4 a decade before. An OS X version was released on August 29, 2013. The game is considered a reboot of the SimCity series. Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for residential, commercial, or industrial development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. SimCity uses a new engine called GlassBox that allows for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, SimCity received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game's use of a persistent Internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources. Prior to release, SimCity received positive reviews; however, the game's launch was received negatively due to widespread technical and gameplay problems related to the mandatory network connection for playing and saving game data. These issues included network outages, problems with saving progress and difficulty connecting to the game's servers. As a result, some reviewers were unable to review the game, labeling the launch a \\"disaster\\" and the game \\"unplayably broken\\", urging players to avoid purchasing the game until the issues were resolved. Gameplay Along with many of the cosmetic changes (such as up-to-date 3D graphics), SimCity uses the new GlassBox engine. \\"We try to build what you would expect to see, and that's the game,\\" explains system architect Andrew Willmott, meaning that visual effects such as traffic, economic troubles, and pollution will be more obvious. Two other new features are a multiplayer component and finite resources. Unlike previous games in the series, the game has non-orthogonal and curved roads and zoning areas that can conform to different road types. Types of zones include residential, commercial and industrial. The density is driven by the types of roads built around these zones. Cities in a region are connected to each other via predefined regional networks such as highways, railways, and waterways. Elements such as traffic and air pollution are visible flowing between cities. Cities can trade resources or share public services with their neighbors like garbage collection or health care. Cities can also pool their collective wealth and resources to build a \\"great work\\" to provide benefits for the entire region like a massive solar power plant or an international airport. The larger the region, the higher is the number of cities and great works that can be built. *Terraforming ‚Äì Creative Director Ocean Quigley stated that all of the terraforming in the game is going to be at the civil engineering scale, and will be the natural consequences of laying out roads, developing zones, and placing buildings. *Transportation options ‚Äì There are a number of options that are included, such as boats, buses, trams, and planes. *Customization ‚Äì Maxis has indicated that the game will support modding, but will not do so at launch like previous versions. Modules in SimCity are attachable structures that can add functionality to existing user-placeable buildings. One example is the extra garage for fire stations, which can provide additional fire trucks for increased protection coverage Another example is the Department of Safety for the City Hall, which unlocks more advanced medical, police and fire department buildings. The user interface, which was inspired by Google Maps and infographics, was designed to convey information to the player more clearly than in previous SimCity games. Animations and color-coded visual cues that represent how efficiently a city functions are only presented when needed at any given moment. For instance, opening up the water tower instantly changes the landscape to a clear world where the density of water is recognizable, and clicking on the sewage tab will immediately show how the waste of the citizens is flowing, and where the system is over capacity. Some of the other visualized data include air pollution, power distribution, police coverage, and zones. Many resources in the game are finite. Some are renewable, such as ground water. Lead gameplay engineer Dan Moskowitz stated, \\"If you've built up an entire city on the economic basis of extracting a certain resource, when that resource runs out your economy will collapse.\\" Different from some previous SimCity titles, each type of zone (residential, commercial, and industrial) is not divided into density categories. Instead the density of the roads next to them determines the type of buildings that will be created there. This means that there is only one of each zone type, and density of the buildings are determined by the density of the roads.alt=Roads in SimCity are one of the most fundamental elements of the mechanics. Unlike previous SimCity games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a straight line tool, one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road. Players will be able to specialize cities on certain industries, such as manufacturing, tourism, education, or others. Each have distinct appearances, simulation behavior, and economic strategies. Players have the option to heavily specialize on one or build multiple specializations in any given city for diversity. The game will feature a simulated global economy. Prices of key resources like oil or food will fluctuate depending on the game world's supply and demand. In particular, if players all over the world are predominantly selling drilled oil from within their game onto the global market, this will drive the price for this resource down. Conversely, a resource that has experienced very little exposure on the world market will be a scarce resource, driving the price up. Multiplayer This version of SimCity is the first to feature full online play since Maxis's SimCity 2000 Network Edition, allowing for regions to house multiple cities from different players. Regions can alternatively be set to private or the game switched to an offline single-player mode for solo play. SimCity requires players to be logged into EA's Origin service to play the game, including when playing single player. An active Internet connection was required every time the game was launched and had to be maintained throughout gameplay at the time of release. The connection is asynchronous, so any brief network disturbance will not interrupt the gameplay though outages of longer than 19 minutes, as an editor posted on Kotaku, will cause loss of gamestate when playing online. Cities in a region can share or sell resources, and work together to build \\"Great Works\\", such as an Arcology. Development Prior to its announcement, the German magazine GameStar leaked concept art. Soon thereafter, a pre-rendered trailer was leaked. The official announcement took place on March 6, 2012 at the Game Developers Conference. Initially it was revealed that the game would be available for the Windows platform, and a later OS X edition was confirmed. EA showcased two new trailers for the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, showcasing in-game graphics for the first time. In August 2012, applicants were allowed to sign up to test closed beta versions of the game that were later released in January and February 2013, in order to perform load testing on the game servers. SimCity creative director Ocean Quigley confirmed that an OS X version was in development, but would not be released at the same time as the Microsoft Windows version. A Maxis graphics engineer had earlier commented that the purchase of the Windows version through the Origin platform will entitle access to the future OS X version. Game engine GlassBox logo EA/Maxis developed the game using a new simulation engine called GlassBox, which takes a different approach from previous simulation games. Those games first simulated high-level statistics and then created graphic animations to represent that data. The GlassBox Engine replaces those statistics with agents, simulation units that represent objects like water, power, and workers; each graphic animation is directly linked to an agent's activity. For example, rather than simply displaying a traffic jam animation to represent a simulated traffic flow problem, traffic jams are instead produced dynamically by masses of Sim agents that simulate travel to and from work. A four-part video has been released featuring Dan Moskowitz, the lead gameplay engineer, talking about the engine simulation behavior. The citizens in the game are also agents and do not lead realistic lives; they go to work at the first job they can find and they go home to the first empty home they find. After the release of the game, modders created mods that enabled offline play and access to debug developer tools. On January 9, 2014 Maxis published its policy on mods where they allow re-skinning and building creation but not mods that change the gameplay. Audio The game's audio is bound to the pulse of the simulation. When a building is running a simulation rule like generating power for example, its driving music and sound effects that are synchronized to the overall beat of the simulation. The audio is telling the player what the simulation is doing. Audio Director Kent Jolly stated that cars in the game are tracked individually. When a car leaves an intersection, the simulator plays a sound of a car pulling away. The sound also changes based on the speed of the game. As cars go faster, the audio is matched to what the player sees, while remaining true to the actual traffic. Chris Tilton is the composer of the game's orchestral score. The music subtly adjusts to the player's experience based on various game states. An example of this is when the view is zoomed out, the player will hear a fuller version of the score. When zoomed in, certain elements of the tracks are taken away. This is done to help make room for all the activity going on in the player's city. The music tracks are also written with population in mind, and the game exposes the full playlist as the player's city develops and grows. Tilton sought to reinvent SimCitys music and not rehash the musical sensibilities of previous games. Release SimCity was released on March 5, 2013 in North America, March 6 in Europe, Australia and Japan, and March 7 in the UK. The retail release of the game came in three editions: the standard edition; the Limited Edition which contained the Heroes & Villains and Plumbob Park DLC sets; and the Collector's Edition which contained the Limited Edition contents in a special steelbook as well as a German City DLC set for Germany, a Paris City DLC set for France and a British City DLC set for other countries. SimCity was also made available in a Digital Deluxe Edition on Origin which contained the three European City DLC sets; a separate Digital Deluxe Upgrade Pack was issued for owners of the standard and Limited editions. The initial release of SimCity on March 5, 2013 in North America suffered multiple severe issues, particularly regarding the game's requirement for a persistent Internet connection. After the game was made available for purchase through EA's Origin delivery service, the high volume of users attempting to download and connect to EA's game servers caused network outages. Players reported experiencing frequent problems during gameplay due to the outages such as long loading times, disconnections, crashing, and loss of saved game data. The server problems and negative feedback led some publications to refer to the launch as \\"disastrous\\" and others have compared the launch unfavorably to that of Diablo III, which experienced similar problems when it was first released. The issues caused online retailer Amazon.com to temporarily withdraw the downloadable version of SimCity from its marketplace citing customer complaints. It was also discovered that there were several issues with the GlassBox engine such as traffic taking the shortest route instead of the route with the most available capacity and sims not living persistent lives but rather going to the nearest available workplace for work and nearest available house after work. Post-release EA responded to server issues by adding additional servers and developing a server patch that disables \\"non-critical gameplay features [including] leaderboards, achievements and region filters.\\" On the evening of March 7, Maxis general manager Lucy Bradshaw issued a statement in response to the launch problems, stating that more servers would be added over the weekend, thousands of players were playing and \\"more than 700,000 cities have been built by our players in just 24 hours\\". She went on to acknowledge that \\"many are experiencing server instability\\" and that \\"players across Europe and Asia are experiencing the same frustration\\". She confirmed that the number of servers would be increased stating \\"We added servers today, and there will be several more added over the weekend.\\" Senior producer Kip Katsarelis commented that the game servers were constantly at maximum capacity, partly due to the large number of players connected for extended periods of time, which has made it difficult for new users to connect: \\"We added more servers to accommodate the launch in [Australia, Japan, and Europe]... our plan is to continue to bring more servers online until we have enough to meet the demand, increase player capacity and let more people through the gates and into the game.\\" In an article about \\"games as a service\\", Nathan Grayson from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that the situation was unacceptable and that EA was handling the situation as well as could be expected, but the problem was that they had damaged the idea of \\"games as a service\\" and lamented the fact that games publishers hadn't learned from previous similar launch failures: \\"this just keeps on happening. ... servers have gone toe-to-toe with day-one stampedes in much the same fashion as a turtle against an 18-wheeler: ... Then nature runs its course, and developers and publishers alike scramble to glue one billion bits of finely pulped turtle back together again,\\" and added \\"A strong service ‚Äì the kind people latch onto and ultimately demand as the norm ‚Äì doesn't just react.\\" On March 8, 2013, EA suspended some of SimCitys online marketing campaigns because of the game's ongoing technical problems. EA has stated it will not be offering refunds for users. In a blog post on March 8, Bradshaw gave an update on the server situation, reporting that the issues had improved and server space had expanded, but acknowledged that some users were still suffering stability problems. She also explained the reason for the failure; \\"So what went wrong? The short answer is: a lot more people logged on than we expected. More people played and played in ways we never saw in the beta\\" and called their error \\"dumb\\". She reported that server capacity had been increased by 120 percent and that errors had dropped by 80 percent. She also promised another update during the weekend. She also announced an offer of a free game from the EA catalogue, saying \\"I know that's a little contrived ‚Äì kind of like buying a present for a friend after you did something crummy. But we feel bad about what happened. We're hoping you won't stay mad and that we'll be friends again when SimCity is running at 100 percent.\\" Maxis ruled out making the game able to be played offline, saying it would take a significant amount of engineering work for this to happen. Shortly afterwards, it was discovered that a line of code could be commented out, allowing the game to be played offline indefinitely. In addition, an article published by Rock, Paper, Shotgun highlighted ways in which, \\"They could make an entire region single player offline with absolute ease.\\" The launch failures also led to fans of the series filing a petition through We the People on the official White House website calling for \\"an industry-wide return policy for video games that rely on remote servers and DRM to function properly\\" which was later covered by mainstream news organizations such as NBC News. To compensate for the issues during the release, EA offered to early purchasers a free game in March 2013. All Origin users who purchased and registered the game before March 23 were allowed to choose a game for free among a small list of titles including SimCity 4, Battlefield 3, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 3 and Need for Speed: Most Wanted. EA had maintained a Server Status page in the SimCity website. This allowed players to check the status of SimCity servers around the world. Patches Since the initial release, Maxis has distributed patches to the game via the in-game patching utility that automatically runs when the game is launched on a user's computer. These patches have addressed, though not entirely fixed, among many other things, issues such as traffic intelligence, game-save rollbacks, and emergency vehicle routing. Maxis has continued to update the game to improve gameplay quality and eliminate bugs. A month following the game launch day, Maxis had released 8 official patches, bringing the game to version 1.8. Maxis released a 2.0 patch, purported to make significant improvements to gameplay and curb defects, that was distributed on April 22, 2013. On May 23, 2013, Maxis released patch 4.0, giving players more updates to the game and re-enabling leader boards. Patch 6 was released July 30, 2013, and included the game's second new region added since the original release date. Patch 7.0, a notable update for users, was released on August 22, 2013. This patch included the addition of a bridge and tunnel tool, letting players create overpasses and underpasses. The update also improved traffic, making it smarter. All patches that have been released have included patch notes describing the contents of the patch and can be found on EA's forums. An offline mode was released in Update 10. The game can now be saved onto the local disk, and cities are static and do not operate while the player is working on an adjacent city. Expansion SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow cover art An expansion called Cities of Tomorrow was announced on September 19, 2013. It was released on November 12, 2013 and is set 50 years in the future. It features new regions, technology, city specializations, and transportation methods. The new features in Cities of Tomorrow are divided into three categories ‚Äì \\"MegaTowers\\", \\"Academy\\" and the \\"OmegaCo\\". The MegaTowers are massive buildings built floor by floor with each floor having a specific purpose, being residential, commercial or to provide services like schools, security, power and entertainment. Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called \\"ControlNet\\" to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as \\"Omega\\" to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic. The expansion also supports \\"futurization\\", in which futuristic buildings tend to \\"futurize\\" the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings to simply make them look more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on. Buildings that will futurize the vicinity are distinguished with a hexagon pattern at the lower part of the building when viewed in the Construction screen. Cities of Tomorrow was released in three editions: the standard edition, the Limited Edition which contains the Launch Arcology DLC set, and an Origin edition which contains the Skyclops Coaster Crown DLC set. Complete Edition On November 13, 2014, EA released SimCity: Complete Edition exclusively on Origin. The compilation release contains SimCity: Digital Deluxe Edition, the Cities of Tomorrow expansion pack, plus the Plumbob Park, Heroes & Villains, Amusement Park, Airships and Skyclops Coaster Crown DLC sets. It does not include the Launch Arcology DLC set of the Cities of Tomorrow Limited Edition. Reception Pre-release At E3 2012 in June 2012, SimCity won 8 awards out of 24 nominations. On August 23, 2012, SimCity won Gamescom's \\"Best PC Game\\" award. The Gamescom jury described the video game as having \\"fantastic graphics\\" and \\"struck the right balance between retaining the trademarks of the old parts and making it interesting for beginners\\". On December 14, 2012, the SimCity development team ran a questions and answers session on the Internet community Reddit where they received criticism for the game's DRM-mechanisms, which require the user to be persistently connected to Electronic Arts' servers in order to be able to play the game. The video games-focused blog Kotaku also voiced concern over the issue, worrying that Electronic Arts could one day shut down their servers, rendering the game unplayable. This prompted a blog response from Bradshaw, in which she defended the always-online component with the comment that \\"real cities do not exist in a bubble; they share a region and affect one another.\\" She goes on to say that increased connectivity to neighboring cities allows for a better experience, allowing for better trade and wider scale effects such as crime and pollution to keep synchronized across the region. Bradshaw also noted the performance benefit due to the engine using EA's server hardware to assist in gameplay calculations. However, Rock, Paper, Shotgun pointed out after the release that cloud resources were not used to support gameplay computation but simply to support inter-city and social media mechanisms. The information was also reported in the mainstream media Those were confirmed by a change in rhetoric from Bradshaw. After the first beta, EA Management staff discussed Q4 2012 results during which Peter Moore commented on the success of the beta, \\"SimCity, a completely new version of the treasured classic, includes deep online features. More than 100,000 people played the SimCity beta last weekend, (...) and the critical reception is shaping up well.\\" Critical reception Upon release, SimCity was met with mostly mixed reviews, many of which were downgraded after reviewers received reports of server problems. It received mixed to negative reception soon after, with GameRankings and Metacritic assigning scores of 63.82% and 64/100, respectively. The issues surrounding the launch affected critics' opinions and reviews of the game. Eurogamer, CNET, and IGN delayed their reviews due to being unable to connect to the game servers, and Polygon, which had reviewed the game before the launch, later dropped its 9.5/10 score down to 8/10, then later dropping it again to 4/10 in response to both the issues, and EA's decision to disable gameplay features. Josh Derocher of Destructoid gave a rating of 4/10, saying that despite his enjoyment of the game, \\"the online dependency, forced multiplayer, and DRM ruin it.\\" Other critics such as Rock, Paper, Shotgun also noted the launch issues with the always-online nature of the game, servers, and cloud save systems. According to Rock, Paper, Shotgun, because a server connection is required even for single-player games, \\"the game, by its very design, is hideously broken.\\" Leif Johnson writing for GameTrailers gave the game an 8.0/10 stating, \\"Aside from some issues with its online requirements, bugs, and restrictions on city size, it's still a satisfying and addicting simulator that will grant dozens of hours of entertainment with one well-designed city alone.\\" CNET UK reported on March 6 that review aggregator Metacritic accumulated a user score of 2.0/10 and several critics reported that the product on Amazon.com had an average rating of 1/5 stars. Amazon customers and the press reported problems with path- finding and artificial intelligence, broken economic simulation, multiplayer aspect not working as advertised, and iconic features missing compared to previous installments of the game. SimCity was also criticized for the size of the area the player is given to build a city; critics have noted it to be significantly smaller than what was available in previous games. Maxis responded to this criticism by stating that this was a deliberate compromise to ensure that the game would run smoothly on the majority of users' computers. Maxis has acknowledged that city size is a major complaint, but has stated that they are not currently working on an increase in size. However, they have stated that larger areas may appear in an upcoming release or expansion of the game. In October 2013, Maxis stated that due to player feedback, they attempted to implement larger cities through \\"months of testing,\\" but ultimately decided to abandon the concept as \\"the system performance challenges [Maxis] encountered would mean that the vast majority of [SimCity's] players wouldn't be able to load, much less play with bigger cities.\\" Cities of Tomorrow reception SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow received mixed reviews from critics. Brett Todd for GameSpot noted that \\"you're left with a game that hides the same dissatisfying experience under a more attractive surface,\\" calling the expansion \\"more of the same.\\" Paul Dean for EuroGamer wrote the expansion pack was \\"heading in the right direction,\\" but \\"it still doesn't make SimCity a particularly good game.\\" Commercial SimCity sold over 1.1 million copies in its first two weeks, 54 percent of which were of the download version of the game. As of July 2013, the game has sold over two million copies.

He was also the Human Resource Development Minister in the United Front government from 1996 to 1998. Biography S.R.Bommai was born on 6 June 1924 in a Sadar Lingayat family at Karadagi village of Shiggaon taluk of the then undivided Dharwad District. He took part in the Quit India movement of 1942. He also played an active role in the unification (Ekikarana in Kannada) of Karnataka which had been divided into Mysore kingdom, Bombay Presidency, Hyderabad, and Madras Presidency, during the British rule. A lawyer by profession, he was elected to the Karnataka Legislative assembly many times from the Hubballi rural constituency and was also a member of the Karnataka Legislative council from 1972 to 1978. He along with Ramakrishna Hegde, J. H. Patel and H. D. Deve Gowda ‚Äî was instrumental in the Janata Party forming a government in the State for the first time in the State in 1983. He was given the weighty portfolio of Industries in the Ramakrishna Hegde government. After Hegde quit on moral grounds, Mr. Bommai took charge as Chief Minister of the State on 13 August 1988 and his government was dismissed by the then Governor, P. Venkatasubbaiah, on 21 April 1989. The dismissal was on the grounds that his government had lost its majority following large-scale defections engineered by several Janata Party leaders of the day. Bommai had sought some time from the Governor to prove his majority on the floor of the Legislature and he was denied this. He challenged this order in the Supreme Court. S. R. Bommai v. Union of India was a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of India, where the Court discussed at length, the provisions of Article 356 of the Constitution of India and related issues. The apex court spelt out restrictions on the Centre's power to dismiss a state government under Article 356. This case had huge impact on Centre-State Relations. Instances of imposition of President's rule have reduced after this judgement. Bommai was National president of the Janata Dal from 1990 to 1996. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha, two times in 1992 and 1998. In 1996, he became the Union minister for Human resource development in the United Front government and served with both the prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral. In 1999, after the Janata Dal split, he sided with the JD(U) faction and later formed the All India Progressive Janata Dal in 2002, as a platform for merger of different factions of Janata Dal. However, after large scale defections, the weakened party was finally merged with JD(U). He died on 10 October 2007, aged 84. His one son, M.S.Bommai is an industrialist in Bangalore, and the other Basavaraj Bommai inherited his political legacy and went on to become a minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government in 2008.

D. Sissoo is a large, crooked tree with long, leathery leaves and whitish or pink flowers. Description D. sissoo is a medium to large deciduous tree with a light crown which reproduces by seeds and suckers. It can grow up to a maximum of in height and in diameter, but is usually smaller. Trunks are often crooked when grown in the open. Leaves are leathery, alternate, pinnately compound and about long. Flowers are whitish to pink, fragrant, nearly sessile, up to long and in dense clusters in length. Pods are oblong, flat, thin, strap-like long, wide and light brown. They contain 1‚Äì5 flat bean-shaped seeds long. They have a long taproot and numerous surface roots which produce suckers. Young shoots are downy and drooping; established stems with light brown to dark gray bark to thick, shed in narrow strips; large upper branches support a spreading crown. Distribution and habitat D. Sissoo is native to the foothills of the Himalayas. It is primarily found growing along river banks below elevation, but can range naturally up to . The temperature in its native range averages , but varies from just below freezing to nearly . It can withstand average annual rainfall up to and droughts of 3‚Äì4 months. Soils range from pure sand and gravel to rich alluvium of river banks; shisham can grow in slightly saline soils. Seedlings are intolerant of shade. Ecology D. Sissoo is the larval food plant of the black rajah (Charaxes solon). Uses Timber Sheesham wood Shisham is the best known economic timber species of the rosewood genus sold internationally, but it is also used as fuel wood and for shade and shelter. After teak, it is the most important cultivated timber tree of Bihar, which is the largest producer of shisham timber in India. In Bihar, the tree is planted on roadsides, along canals and as a shade tree for tea plantations. It is also commonly planted in southern Indian cities like Bangalore as a street tree. Sheesham is usually dried before being used in furniture manufacturing, a process commonly known as seasoning. Locally sheesham is left in wide open areas to dry under the sun for about six months. Commercially, sheesham is dried in closed chambers with hot air circulation for about seven to fifteen days, depending on weather conditions. The ideal moisture level is supposed to be 5-6% for thinner pieces and up to 11% for thicker ones, depending on use. Anything lower than this can cause sudden cracking of the final products. Sheesham is among the finest cabinet and veneer timbers. It is the wood from which 'mridanga', the Rajasthani percussion instrument, is often made. In addition to musical instruments, it is used for plywood, agricultural tools, flooring, and as a bentwood, and for turning. The heartwood is golden to dark brown; the sapwood is white to pale brownish white. The heartwood is durable (the specific gravity is 0.7 ‚Äì 0.8) and is very resistant to fungi; but the sapwood is readily attacked by dry-wood termites and borers. Dalbergia sissoo is known to contain the neoflavonoid dalbergichromene in its stem-bark and heartwood. Fuel wood A sheesham tree growing in Pakistan. The calorific value of both the sapwood and heartwood is 'excellent', being reported to be 4,908 kcal/kg and 5,181 kcal/kg respectively. As a fuel wood it is grown on a 10 to 15-year rotation. The tree has excellent coppicing ability, although a loss of vigor after two or three rotations has been reported. Shisham wood makes excellent charcoal for heating and cooking.  Teeth brushing Traditionally, slender tree twigs (called datun) are first chewed as a toothbrush and then split as a tongue cleaner. This practise has been in use in Pakistan, Africa, and the Middle East for centuries. In India, sheesham have been used in Siddha medicine system for skin disorders and stomach related issues. Many of India's 80% rural population still start their day with the teeth cleaning twig either with Salvadora persica or Azadirachta indica. In other parts of the world sheesham twigs are still collected and sold in markets for this use in rural areas.  Pesticide  Ethanolic extract of the fruits of Dalbergia sissoo exhibited molluscicide effect against eggs of the freshwater snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi.Adenusi A. A. & Odaibo A. B. (2009). \\"Effects of varying concentrations of the crude aqueous and ethanolic\\". African Journal of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative medicines 6(2). abstract, PDF. Construction The juice of this plant is a potent ingredient for a mixture of wall plaster, according to the SamarƒÅ·πÖga·πáa S≈´tradhƒÅra, which is a Sanskrit treatise dealing with ≈öilpa≈õƒÅstra (Hindu science of art and construction). Cultivation Propagation takes place most commonly by root suckers and also by seeds. The seeds remain viable for only a few months. Seeds should be soaked in water for 48 hours before sowing and 60% ‚Äì 80% germination can be expected in 1‚Äì3 weeks. Seedlings require partial sun or full sun. In India sheesham wood trading and its usages are under government restrictions. Local names Common names for D. sissoo are sisu, tahli or tali, and also irugudujava. Indian common names are ', and '. Pakistani common names are 'sheesham' and 'tahli' in Punjab. In Afghanistan its name is shewa, and in Persian, it is called jag.

The area includes the municipality of Jumilla, from which it takes its name, and the contiguous southeast of the Albacete province (municipalities of Montealegre del Castillo, Fuente-√Ålamo, Ontur, Hellin, Albatana and Tobarra) in the Castile-La Mancha region. It is one of Spain's leading wine regions. History During the outbreak of the phylloxera plague in the 19th century the region surprisingly escaped contamination and so entered a period of economic expansion as wine merchants from France came in great numbers to buy wine. For this reason the vines were never regrafted onto resistant rootstock from the New World as was the case in the rest of Europe. However, the phylloxera pest unexpectedly struck in 1989, devastating the vineyards and reducing production by 60% over the next five years. Replanting and grafting was slow and expensive but allowed the region to adopt the new methods of grape growing and wine making that were already proving successful in the neighbouring DOPs of Alicante and Almansa. Geography This DOP is characterised by wide valleys and plateaus in the presence of mountains. It is a transition zone between the Mediterranean coastal area and the high central plateau of Castile-La Mancha, and so the altitude of the vineyards varies between 400 and 800 m. Climate The climate is continental (long hot summers and cold winters), tempered by the closeness of the Mediterranean Sea. The area is arid. Rainfall is low (around 300 mm/year) and irregular, though it mostly falls during spring and autumn, often in the form of violent storms which can sometimes cause damage to the vines. The average annual temperature is 16¬∞C. A maximum of 40¬∞C can be reached in summer, and minimums below 0¬∞C in winter. There is a risk of frost up to the month of March, exceptionally until April. The vines receive over 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. Soils The soils are dark, lime bearing and sometimes with a hard lime crust. In general, they are permeable and have good moisture retaining properties, which allows the vines to survive during periods of prolonged drought. They are poor in organic material and their structure does not favour the propagation of phylloxera. They are quite sandy, allowing good aeration, have a high pH value and are low in salinity. Grape varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red grapes: Monastrell, Tempranillo (known locally as Cencibel), Garnacha Tintorera, Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot. * White grapes: Air√©n, Macabeo, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Pedro Xim√©nez and Malvas√≠a. Of these varieties, Monastrell is the most significant for Jumilla DOP, as it represents over 85% of the vines planted. Monastrell is in fact the fourth most widely planted red grape variety in Spain. Like Air√©n, it has good resistance to drought. The planning density is between 1,100 vines/ha to 1,600 vines/ha for extensive planting formations, and the maximum authorised yield is 4,000 kg/ha for red varieties and 4,500 kg/ha for white varieties. For intensive planting formations the density ranges from 1,600 vines/ha to 3,200 vines/ha with maximum yields of 7,000 kg/ha for both red and white varieties. Jumilla labeling laws Jumilla DOP wine bottle label, Spain Spanish wines are often labeled according to the amount of aging the wine has received. When the label says vino joven (\\"young wine\\") or sin crianza, the wines will have undergone very little, if any, wood aging. Depending on the producer, some of these wines will be meant to be consumed very young - often within a year of their release. Others will benefit from some time aging in the bottle. For the vintage year (vendimia or cosecha) to appear on the label, a minimum of 85% of the grapes must be from that year's harvest. The three most common aging designations on Spanish wine labels are Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva. ‚Ä¢Crianza red wines are aged for 1 year with at least 6 months in oak and 6 months in the bottle. Crianza whites and ros√©s must be aged for at least 1 year with at least 4 months in oak. ‚Ä¢Reserva red wines are aged for at least 2 years with at least 12 months in oak and 12 months in the bottle. Reserva whites and ros√©s must be aged for at least 18 months with at least 6 months in oak. ‚Ä¢Gran Reserva wines typically appear in above average vintages. The red wines require at least four years aging, twelve months of which in oak and a minimum of 36 months in the bottle. Gran Reserva whites and ros√©s must be aged for at least 4 years with at least 6 months in oak. References External links * D.O.P.

Nicholas Aloysius Kenny (February 3, 1895 in Astoria, New York - December 1, 1975 in Sarasota, Florida) was a syndicated newspaper columnist, a song lyricist and a poet who wrote light verse in the Edgar Guest tradition. Biography Born in Queens, Kenny attended high school for only three months before joining the Navy (1911‚Äì18), serving on the USS Arizona, followed by a tour of duty in the Merchant Marine (1918‚Äì20). He continued his education with extensive reading in ships' libraries. He began writing poetry but did not sign his poems until one was published in Arthur Brisbane's column. While a sportswriter and rewrite man at the Bayonne Times (1920‚Äì23), he wrote his first column, \\"Getting an Earful\\" (later collected in a 1932 book). After a brief period at the Boston American (1923‚Äì24), Kenny moved on to the New York Journal (1924‚Äì27) and the New York Daily News (1927‚Äì30). He was the radio editor at the New York Daily Mirror, and in 1930, he began writing \\"Nick Kenny Speaking,\\" a column combining verse, jokes and observational humor with his commentary on current radio programs. The popularity of the column kept him at the New York Daily Mirror until that paper shut down in 1963. At that point, he moved to Sarasota, Florida where he wrote a column for the Sarasota Herald Tribune until his death. When the USS Arizona went down at Pearl Harbor, one of Kenny's poems was on the ship's bulletin board. Kenny is mainly remembered today as the lyricist of the 1931 popular song standard, \\"Love Letters in the Sand\\", a 1957 gold record hit for Pat Boone. Kenny's next big success, \\"Gold Mine in the Sky,\\" inspired the Gene Autry movie, Gold Mine in the Sky (1938) and enabled Kenny and his brother Charles to launch their own music firm, Gold Mine in the Sky Publishing Company. His songs included \\"Gone Fishin'\\" and \\"Scattered Toys\\" recorded by The Three Suns, which has lyrics somewhat similar to one of his \\"Patty Poems\\". During the mid-1930s he was the host of The Nick Kenny Radio Hour which sometimes featured the song-and-dance team of Jacqueline and William Daniels (who grew up to become the Screen Actors Guild President in 1999-2001). In 1934, the Three X Sisters, a popular radio harmony trio were part of his \\"Radio Scandal's\\" scripted radio act. Delores Hawkins (1927‚Äì87) was the vocalist on Nick Kenny's Children's Follies. Kenny was a guest on various radio programs between 1939 and 1952, including What's My Name?, Finders Keepers, Music for Millions and The Billion Dollar Show, a 1952 program celebrating the 30th anniversary of broadcasting. He also contributed scripts and poems to Mutual's Family Theatre. On NBC television, Kenny had his own 15-minute music and talk show, The Nick Kenny Show (1951‚Äì52) with cast members Irene Walsh and Don Tippen. Kenny published several collections of his poems between 1929 and 1959. In addition to poems, the collection Day Unto Day (1943) also featured quotations in \\"Uncle Nick's Scrap Book,\\" plus tributes to Kenny by Major Edward Bowes, Uncle Don, Ted Malone, Elsa Maxwell and Kate Smith. The poems in this book were grouped into sections, including Human Interest Poems, Personality Poems, Sailor Poems, Patty Poems and Joy Poems. The latter two were about his daughters, Patty and Joy, who were ages 15 and 11, respectively, at the time the book was published. The illustrator Richard Bassford has long had an interest in Kenny's work and has illustrated Kenny poems in recent years.

It forms part of Seppiko-Mineyama Prefectural Natural Park.  Outline  There are contradicting definitions of Mount Seppiko. Yumesaki, which was merged into Himeji City in 2005, officially define Mount Seppiko as the name of a group mountains of Mount Horagatake (884m), Mount Hokotate (950m), and Mount Mitsuji (915m). However, maps of the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan show the peak of Mount Mitsuji as the peak of Mount Seppiko. Many mountain guide books write that Mount Otenjo, one of the peaks of rocky Mount Horagatake, is the default peak of the Seppiko. Other people define the Seppiko as a name of another group of mountains consisting of Mount Horagatake, Mount Hokotate, Mount Mitsuji, and Mount Myojin, Mount Nagusa.  Religion and history  Mount Seppiko is a place for the ascetic practices of Shugend≈ç in this region. According to the official history of the Kaya Jinja, a Shinto shrine in the middle of the mountain, the shrine was established in the 7th century in the time of Empress Suiko. Mount Seppiko also is considered to be developed for Shugensha, practitioners of Shugend≈ç. Kaya Jinja was originally a typical example of Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç, literally \\"fusion of practices from both Shinto and Buddhism\\", and had a Buddhist temple, Seppiko-san Kongo Chingo-ji, just beside the Shinto shrine. However, the temple was abolished by the Shinbutsu Bunri Order, literally Shinto-Buddhism-separation Order of the Meiji Government in 1868. Mount Seppiko is one of the mountains which still have some areas which women are prohibited from entering, in order not to disturb the training of Shugensha.  Tourism  Mount Seppiko is also very famous for rock climbing. It attracts many climbers in Kansai area.

It is at its highest point. It is also known to some as Inchebroida. The name Inchcailloch means \\"Isle of the old woman\\" or \\"Isle of the Cowled (Hooded) Woman\\" in the Scottish Gaelic language. Saint Kentigerna went to Scotland from Ireland to preach and spread Christianity and the island is thought to be named after her. Geography and geology Inchmurrin, Creinch, Torrinch, and Inchcailloch all form part of the Highland boundary fault. There is a burial ground in the north of the island, and a bay, Port Bawn (; ), in the south. Like many of the Loch Lomond islands, it is quite heavily wooded. Transport There is a passenger ferry across the short channel separating it from Balmaha on the mainland. As a result, it receives more visitors than most of the Loch Lomond islands, currently 20,000 visitors per year. There is a camp site in the south at Port Bawn and a nature trail.  History  A map of the 1800s showing the islands of Loch Lomond. Inchcailloch has been used as a hunting forest since the reign of Robert the Bruce. Deer still roam the island. White deer have been seen on the island in 2003. The narrow crossing is very shallow making an easy passage for deer to ford. The island was farmed until the early 19th century, being recorded in 1800 as producing good wheat and oats; the ruins of the farm can still be seen.Garnett, T. (1800). Observations on a Tour of the Highlands ... London. V.1. p. 40. For around 130 years, Inchcailloch was an oak plantation. The resulting timber was processed at Balmaha (on the site of the Highland Way Inn), for making wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), wood tar, and dye. Inchcailloch had a church dedicated to St Kentigerna, which was the parish church until 1621, but the graveyard was used until 1947. St Kentigerna was an Irish woman who is not to be confused with St Kentigern (a man who is also known as St Mungo). The Clan MacGregor burial ground includes some of Rob Roy's ancestors. Legends have passed by word of mouth that the bones of a woman were found under the altar stone during an excavation. Inchcailloch forms part of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve, owned and run by Scottish Natural Heritage. Literary references Inchcailloch is mentioned in Dr William Fraser's The Lennox (1874). The travel writer, H.V. Morton visited in the 1930s, and remarked: :The isle is sacred to the MacGregors, and in the tangled branches and amongst the green trees is their ancient burial ground. It was on the halidom of him 'who sleeps beneath the grey stone of Inchcailloch' that members of this vigorous clan used to take their oaths. Walter Scott refers to the island in his poem, The Lady of the Lake - :A slender crosslet formed with care :A cubit's length in measure due :The shafts and limbs were rods of yew :Whose parents in Inch Cailliach wave :Their Shadows o'er Clan Alpine's grave, :And, answering Lomond's breezes deep, :Soothe many a chieftain's endless sleep.

Born in Havana, he became involved in Cuba's turbulent left-wing politics as a young man, joining the tiny Popular Socialist Party, the Moscow-line predecessor of the Communist Party, during the years of right-wing regimes that preceded the 1959 revolution. The PSP had only a few thousand members, but was well-organized and had strong links with the urban unions. The PSP at first played little part in Fidel Castro's armed struggle against the dictatorship of General Fulgencio Batista, which took place mainly in the countryside, and only threw its weight behind Castro's guerrilla campaign a few months before Batista finally fled the country. Until then, it had tended to denounce the young rebels' \\"adventurism.\\" Despite this background of mistrust, when Castro moved the revolution sharply to the left in the early 1960s he found a use for the PSP apparatus, and for young but experienced activists such as Malmierca, in giving a disciplined organizational underpinning to his embryonic regime. Malmierca was one of the founders of the powerful state security apparatus ‚Äî a role for which his lack of any discernible personality and reluctance to reveal even the most innocuous details about his personal life, must have been a positive advantage. He was also one of the functionaries who supervised the merger of the PSP with Castro's July 26 Movement to form the Cuban Communist Party in 1965. In both of these functions, Malmierca had to balance the professional politicians and the young idealists who had followed Castro into the hills in the mid-1950s. He performed this difficult task well enough to earn advancement, becoming a member of the new party's central committee and being made editor of its official organ, the daily newspaper Granma. The high point of Malmierca's career as a faithful servant of the Cuban Revolution came in December 1976, when he replaced the veteran left-wing intellectual Ra√∫l Roa Garc√≠a as foreign minister, and was also appointed vice-president of the council of ministers. Malmierca remained at the foreign ministry until 1992, when he was succeeded by his deputy, Ricardo Alarc√≥n. By that time, Malmierca was in poor health and he was given a relatively undemanding job that made use of both his journalistic experience and foreign contacts, as director of Tips- Cuba, an official information service for prospective foreign investors. He died on August 11, 2001 in Havana from lung cancer. References * The Miami Herald, August 14, 2001.

This method attempts to unite the advantages of the popular biochemical (cationic lipids or polymers) and physical (electroporation, gene gun) transfection methods in one system while excluding their inconveniences (low efficiency, toxicity). Magnetofection is commercialized by OZ Biosciences and is registered as a trademark. Principle The magnetofection principle is to associate nucleic acids with cationic magnetic nanoparticles: these molecular complexes are then concentrated and transported into cells supported by an appropriate magnetic field. In this way, the magnetic force allows a very rapid concentration of the entire applied vector dose onto cells, so that 100% of the cells get in contact with a significant vector dose. Applications Magnetofection has been adapted to all types of nucleic acids (DNA, siRNA, dsRNA, shRNA, mRNA, ODN), non viral transfection systems (transfection reagents) and viruses. It has been successfully tested on a broad range of cell lines, hard-to-transfect and primary cells. Several optimized and efficient magnetic nanoparticle formulations have been specifically developed for several types applications such as DNA, siRNA, and primary neuron transfection as well as viral applications. Mechanism The magnetic nanoparticles are made of iron oxide, which is fully biodegradable, coated with specific cationic proprietary molecules varying upon the applications. Their association with the gene vectors (DNA, siRNA, ODN, virus, etc.) is achieved by salt-induced colloidal aggregation and electrostatic interaction. The magnetic particles are then concentrated on the target cells by the influence of an external magnetic field generated by magnets. The cellular uptake of the genetic material is accomplished by endocytosis and pinocytosis, two natural biological processes. Consequently, membrane architecture and structure stays intact, in contrast to other physical transfection methods that damage the cell membrane. The nucleic acids are then released into the cytoplasm by different mechanisms depending upon the formulation used: 1) is the proton sponge effect caused by cationic polymers coated on the nanoparticles that promote endosome osmotic swelling, disruption of the endosome membrane and intracellular release of DNA form, 2) is the destabilization of endosome by cationic lipids coated on the particles that release the nucleic acid into cells by flip-flop of cell negative lipids and charge neutralization and 3) is the usual viral infection mechanism when virus is used. Magnetofection works for primary cells and hard to transfect cells that are not dividing or slowly dividing, meaning that the genetic materials can go to the cell nucleus without cell division. Coupling magnetic nanoparticles to gene vectors of any kind results in a dramatic increase of the uptake of these vectors and consequently high transfection efficiency. Biodistribution of magnetic nanoparticles The biodegradable cationic magnetic nanoparticles are not toxic at the recommended doses and even higher doses. Gene vectors / magnetic nanoparticles complexes are seen into cells after 10‚Äì15 minutes that is much faster than any other transfection method. After 24, 48 or 72 hours, most of the particles are localized in the cytoplasm, in vacuoles (membranes surrounded structure into cells) and occasionally in the nucleus.

The UDB advocates devolution for Brittany as well as the promotion of the Breton language and its associated culture. The Breton Democratic Union has held three seats on the Regional Council of Brittany since March 2004. A fourth seat was held by Christian Troadec, mayor of Carhaix who, although not a member of the organization was considered close to it. He chose, however, to leave the regional majority the 18 December 2008 over the hospital of Carhaix question. The UDB is allied with Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV) and is a member of the European Free Alliance (EFA). The party supports the creation of a Federal Europe. In March 2010, via their electoral alliance, Europe Ecologie Bretagne (EEB), the UDB won four seats on the council of the French administrative region of Brittany. The Socialist Party (PS) refused to align themselves with EEB to fight the second round of the election ‚Äì the result being that the UDB is not represented in government. History Foundation The UDB was founded in 1964 in Rennes by a group of about fifteen young people, most of them students, often from cultural organizations (Ar Falz, Bagadou, etc.) and influenced by socialist ideas. They included Ronan Leprohon (1939‚Äì2017). The majority belonged to the MOB organization which also included former militants of Breton Nationalist Party and supporters of French Algeria, which was a cause of tensions. The first congress of the UDB took place in December 1964 in Quimper, with a mere 18 participants. The UDB was founded in opposition to the practice of torture in Algeria and compared the decolonization of the Maghreb to Brittany. The structure of the new party was then close to that of those of the far-left with a strict internal discipline. Its charter, elaborated in 1964 supported a planned economy and the creation of a European Federation. It claimed to be hostile to militarism and colonialism, which was an innovation in the Breton movement at the time. The creation of the UDB marked a rupture in the history of the Breton nationalist movement which, until then, was rather right-wing. It took part in the 1965 local elections. Jean-Paul Berre was elected on a list of the Union of the left dominated by the French Communist Party in Guilvinec and becomes deputy-mayor and first elected official of the UDB. Beginnings (1966‚Äì69) The first years were difficult. The party grew slowly and had few resources. It approached the other left-wing parties, in particular the PSU and FGDS. After 1967, however, recruitment intensified, in particular in student unions. In the 1969 constitutional referendum, the UDB called for a \\"no\\" vote, like most of the left. Crisis of 1969‚Äì70 Internal contradictions within the party exploded during the 1969 congress when Alain Guyader challenged the charter of the UDB and proposed a line inspired by Rosa Luxemburg's ideas. Moreover, he refused to condemn the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The conflict led to the exclusion of Jean- Yves Guiomar and Alain Guyader in 1970 for \\"rejection of democratic centralism, constant undervaluation of the adversary, impatience and the theory of active minorities, and the idolization of spontaneity\\". Success (1970‚Äì78) The party was rebuilt during the congress of Guidel and adopted democratic centralism. It also adopted a Marxist line and demanded in a modified version of its charter the abolition of capitalism and the collective appropriation of the means of production. At the same time, a UDB list won 11.5% of the votes in a local by-election in Auray, primarily thanks to the personality of its candidate Sten Kidna. In the 1971 local elections the UDB took part in the lists of the Union of the Left, except in Brest where it polled 4.8% running independently. The number of party members ‚Äì 243 in 1971 ‚Äì grew throughout the 1970s, thanks to the involvement of the party in social conflicts. During the 1973 general election, the UDB nominated five candidates who obtained between 0.8% and 3.2% of the vote despite a large showing by other left-wing parties. The most successful candidate, Erwan Evenou, won more than 3% in the Hennebont constituency. During the cantonal elections held that same year, the party won 4.45% of the votes ‚Äì 6.7% in Lorient. In the 1974 presidential election it campaigned in the second round for Fran√ßois Mitterrand. In the 1976 cantonal elections the UDB ran nine candidates who won 5.27% on average. The local elections of 1977 enabled it to get 35 seats on the lists of the Union of the Left. In the 1978 general election, the party ran 17 candidates in a strongly polarized environment. Crisis of 1978‚Äì84 Party growth slowed as a result of failure of the legislative elections and the collapse of the United Left, in which the UDB was firmly anchored. While the party scored encouraging results (5.63%) in the 1979 cantonal elections, these were marked by very low voter turnout. The victory of the left in 1981, paradoxically, increased the UDB's loss of momentum. Although policies in line with UDB positions were passed (such as decentralization, the cancelling of the Plogoff nuclear plant and the abolition of the death penalty), the UDB could claim little responsibility for them compared to the then-triumphant PS, and its usefulness seemed questionable. In 1984, during the Lorient congress, one of the sections from L√©on, whose motion had won a third of the votes, created a splinter group, Frankiz Breizh, based primarily in Brest and its immediate surroundings. Crisis of 1984‚Äì2001 After the departure of the Brest militants, the party was rebuilt and approached the European Free Alliance which then united about fifteen European regionalist parties of the centre-left. Despite considerable financial problems, it ran about thirty candidates in the 1985 cantonal elections and won on average 4.2%. Results in the Brest area, however, had considerably declined. The 1986 regional elections, characterized by a strong bipolarization, were a failure for the party which won only 1.51%. During this time, contacts with Plaid Cymru became regular and in 1987 the UDB joined the European Free Alliance. In the 1988 presidential election, the UDB supported the former Communist Pierre Juquin in the first round and Fran√ßois Mitterrand in the runoff. In 1992, following the failure of negotiations with the Greens, the UDB presented its own list along with Emgann (which would eventually withdraw because of a nomination problem). The results were disappointing (2%) and strengthened the mistrust of the UDB towards alliances with the other nationalist groups. The Saint-Brieuc congress, held in 1994, was an occasion for reconciliation with Frankiz Breizh whose political positions had never differed much from those of the UDB. In November of the same year the two organizations, together with the Occitan Party, the Party of the Corsican Nation, and Basque Solidarity, took part in the creation of the Federation of Regions and Peoples with Solidarity. 2001‚Äìpresent After 2001, the party experienced notable membership growth as well as an improvement in its electoral results. In the 2001 local elections it chose to take part in lists presented by the united left except in Guingamp, Redon, Lannion and Saint-Nazaire. Their results varied between 6.02% in Saint-Nazaire and 13.7% in Guingamp. The UDB remained in the second round in Sarzeau and Guingamp. Moreover, the party participated in the victorious list of Christian Troadec in Carhaix. This success encouraged the UDB to consider presenting an autonomous list in the 2004 regional elections. It finally resolved to open negotiations with The Greens. The UDB was in a strong position. A separate regionalist list could have won between three and five percent, thus cutting into the vote share of the ecologists and condemning their efforts to assert their independence from the Socialist Party. The elections themselves were a success for The Greens-UDB list, which won nearly 10%. The UDB won three seats and a vice-presidency. The 2005 French European Constitution referendum caused several well-known members of the UDB to call for a \\"no\\" vote, against the official position of the party which called for a vote in favour of the proposed constitution. During the 2007 presidential election, the UDB supported Green candidate Dominique Voynet. In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party supported the Europe √âcologie electoral coalition, which included The Greens. In June 2012 Paul Molac was elected to the National Assembly of France, the first Breton autonomist to do so. He stood for the UDB as a Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens candidate in Morbihan uncontested by their electoral allies, the Socialist Party. In the 2015 regional elections, the UDB made an alliance with Christian Troadec, one of the leaders of Breton autonomy. However, the UDB gained only 6.7% of votes, which was insufficient to ensure the election of regional councillors (a party must win at least 10% of the votes in order to go forward to the second round). During the 2017 legislative elections, the UDB, together with the MBP, reactivated the dynamics of \\"Oui la Bretagne\\" (Yes Brittany) by aligning 34 candidates on 37 constituencies. This coalition obtained 32,422 votes, its highest score in this type of election, which was unfavourable to it. At the same time, it gains its independence for access to public funding for political parties. During the 2019 European elections, the UDB, through the federation R√©gions et Peuples Solidaires (R&PS;) associated with EELV (the Greens), participates in the important score achieved by the national EELV list in Brittany, with 16.92% of the votes, while the average score of the list outside the zones where regionalists are associated is only 13.1% in the hexagon. Fran√ßois Alfonsi from Corsica (R&PS;) was elected in 9th position on the list, Lydie Massard from the UDB, 14th on the list, was not elected with only 30,000 votes.

Hartwood is considered the crown jewel of the county's network of nine distinct parks. Purchased by the county in 1969, its special feature is one of the largest and most spectacular country estates in the region. Hartwood consists of a stately Tudor mansion (begun in 1927 and completed in 1929), an English style Formal Garden, a cottage, a stable complex, and a gate lodge (erected in 1927). The mansion, designed by Alfred Hopkins for John and Mary Flinn Lawrence, houses a collection of original English and American antiques. Hartwood is sited northeast of Downtown Pittsburgh on largely forested land in both Hampton and Indiana townships. The park also offers a large-stage concert area where the Free Summer Concert Series is held, as well as the Allegheny County Music Festival, and of trails‚Äîhorse riding, walking, hiking, biking, and cross country skiing. Hartwood is especially well-known because of its now-defunct \\"Festival of Lights,\\" a large outdoor light display once held during the holiday season to benefit local charities. History Mary Flinn Lawrence, a Pittsburgh philanthropist, created Hartwood with money she inherited from her father, Senator William Flinn. In the 1920s, she and her husband John Lawrence asked architect Alfred Hopkins to borrow design elements from a manor house the Lawrences had seen in Broadway, Oxfordshire, England. The result was a stately 31-room slate-roofed stone house constructed around a great hall. Mary transformed the grounds of her estate into an equestrian arts showcase, building riding trails that extend for miles, show rings, steeplechase layouts, and ivy-covered stables. The stalls of the stables are made of varnished oak. The Allegheny Parks Commission bought of land and riding trails from Mary (John died in 1945) in 1969, with several stipulations. 1) Mary was to be able to remain in residence until her death as were her servants, 2) The land would never be subdivided, and 3) the county would also purchase her sister Edith's home, which was called Harkaway Farm (This is now the area called the Middle Road Concert Area where the amphitheater is located). Mary died on October 29, 1974, and in 1976 the new park was opened to the public. Usage in popular culture A large segment of the 1996 TV film The Christmas Tree, directed by Sally Field, was filmed at Hartwood. Some scenes in the 2006 film 10th & Wolf were filmed in the Hartwood Mansion's great hall. The pilot episode for the cancelled Twentieth Century Fox Television adaptation of Joe Hill's Eisner Award-winning graphic novel, Locke & Key, was filmed at the Hartwood Mansion in early 2011. Scenes from the 2014 blockbuster The Fault in our Stars were filmed near the Middle Road entrance to the park.

It is based on the 1981 horror novel by English writer Ramsey Campbell.  Plot  The gruesomely mutilated body of a girl is found in a manhole by Spanish police. The parents of missing six-year-old Angela Gifford, local editor Claudia and her British husband Marc, are duly notified. The identification is only deemed possible thanks to a bracelet and a four-centimeter leg length discrepancy. All other identifying traits are missing and the body shows needle insertions and acid burns, apparently inflicted antemortem. Five years later, Claudia is still haunted by the tragedy. She is living alone, addicted to tranquilizers and stalked by her possessive ex-boyfriend Toni. One day, she receives a desperate phone call from someone identifying herself as her presumed dead daughter and begging to be rescued. Intrigued by the resemblance to Angela's voice and the mention of a seaside location where she used to take her daughter, Claudia visits the site. The nearby deserted clinic reveals grotesque angelic imagery and an orthopedic boot ostensibly left for her to find. Claudia contacts Massera, the detective who probed into Angela's disappearance. Despite his recent discharge from the force, he agrees to investigate. Massera's research lends credibility to the hypothesis that Angela is alive, since a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. A visit to a Jesuit expert in the Pontifical University uncovers a bizarre cult called The Nameless. It was first documented in Liverpool in 1962 and led by Argentinian expatriate Santini, whose scientific approach to ponerology went far beyond the activities of his original London occult circles. He believed in absolute evil and the path to reverse sanctity through heinous acts. He also advocated radical ego stripping to the point of losing one's name, thus the nameless sobriquet. Santini was arrested in 1982 for raping and mutilating two children. His project had links to the Thule Society and an accomplice of his, a neurologist from the Dachau concentration camp, was later released for lack of evidence. Claudia and Massera cross paths with occult tabloid journalist Quiroga, who receives a videotape labelled with Claudia's phone number. It contains a snuff film featuring a young female victim, followed by surreptitious footage of Claudia visiting the derelict clinic. Fearing for her safety and sanity, Claudia spends the night in Massera's apartment. Their bond deepens when she learns he was widowed the previous year and is as despondent as herself. Meanwhile, her unhinged ex-boyfriend is approached in a bar by a hideously disfigured man whose stare had disturbed Claudia in an earlier scene. This stranger eggs Toni on to entering her apartment uninvited, and is joined by accomplices as they leave. Claudia and Massera visit Santini in prison. His already disturbing countenance is compounded by a skin disease inoculated during his forceful internment in Dachau. He speaks to Claudia in riddles, obliquely mentions his acquaintance with Angela, recounts his confinement in a cobalt capsule in Dachau, and extols evil and suffering as sources of enlightenment. Claudia's pleas elicit his enigmatic advice to find Angela 'where it all began'. It soon becomes apparent that Santini's followers are still active; upon returning to her apartment, Claudia and Massera find Toni butchered, along with another cryptic message. The trail leads to the now-abandoned hotel where Angela was conceived, thereby unveiling Santini's mysterious clue. Quiroga scouts ahead following indications by the Dachau neurologist but is quickly subdued and killed by cultists. Massera arrives soon thereafter and is murdered offscreen. Claudia is lured there by a phone call from Angela. She is greeted by cult members, including Angela's father. Marc reveals that everything was planned by the cult: conceiving Angela, raising her to be pure and innocent, kidnapping and subjecting her to abuse in their quest for a pure evil being, and finally leading Claudia to their den. Claudia confronts her visibly perverted daughter, whose task is now to commit the \\"ultimate atrocity\\" she was groomed and conditioned for matricide. Instead, Angela shoots Marc through the door and briefly seems to resist the indoctrination ‚Äì before proclaiming she has a plan more sinister than the cult's own. She cynically tells Claudia \\"I will call you [again]\\", before putting the gun in her mouth and pulling the trigger.

Apparatus used in the Fizeau experiment The Fizeau experiment was carried out by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1851 to measure the relative speeds of light in moving water. Fizeau used a special interferometer arrangement to measure the effect of movement of a medium upon the speed of light. According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged along by the medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the speed of the medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. When he repeated the experiment with air in place of water he observed no effect. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities. Although it is referred to as the Fizeau experiment, Fizeau was an active experimenter who carried out a wide variety of different experiments involving measuring the speed of light in various situations. Experimental setup Figure 2. Highly simplified representation of Fizeau's experiment. Figure 3. Setup of the Fizeau Experiment (1851) A highly simplified representation of Fizeau's 1851 experiment is presented in Fig. 2\\\\. Incoming light is split into two beams by a beam splitter (BS) and passed through two columns of water flowing in opposite directions. The two beams are then recombined to form an interference pattern that can be interpreted by an observer. The simplified arrangement illustrated in Fig. 2 would have required the use of monochromatic light, which would have enabled only dim fringes. Because of white light's short coherence length, use of white light would have required matching up the optical paths to an impractical degree of precision, and the apparatus would have been extremely sensitive to vibration, motion shifts, and temperature effects. On the other hand, Fizeau's actual apparatus, illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, was set up as a common-path interferometer. This guaranteed that the opposite beams would pass through equivalent paths, so that fringes readily formed even when using the sun as a light source. Figure 4. Setup of the Fizeau Experiment (1851) A light ray emanating from the source S‚Ä≤ is reflected by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming back and forth as shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L‚Ä≤, so that one ray always propagates in the same direction as the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube. Fresnel drag coefficient Assume that water flows in the pipes with speed v. According to the non- relativistic theory of the luminiferous aether, the speed of light should be increased when \\"dragged\\" along by the water, and decreased when \\"overcoming\\" the resistance of the water. The overall speed of a beam of light should be a simple additive sum of its speed through the water plus the speed of the water. That is, if n is the index of refraction of water, so that c/n is the velocity of light in stationary water, then the predicted speed of light w in one arm would be :w_+=\\\\frac{c}{n}+v \\\\ , and the predicted speed in the other arm would be :w_-=\\\\frac{c}{n} - v \\\\ . Hence light traveling against the flow of water should be slower than light traveling with the flow of water. The interference pattern between the two beams when the light is recombined at the observer depends upon the transit times over the two paths, and can be used to calculate the speed of light as a function of the speed of the water. Fizeau found that :w_+=\\\\frac{c}{n}+ v\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right) \\\\ . In other words, light appeared to be dragged by the water, but the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected. The Fizeau experiment forced physicists to accept the empirical validity of an old, theoretically unsatisfactory theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1818) that had been invoked to explain an 1810 experiment by Arago, namely, that a medium moving through the stationary aether drags light propagating through it with only a fraction of the medium's speed, with a dragging coefficient f given by :f = 1-\\\\frac{1}{n^2} \\\\ . In 1895, Hendrik Lorentz predicted the existence of an extra term due to dispersion: : w_+ = \\\\frac {c}{n} + v \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{n} \\\\\\\\! \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{ \\\\mathrm{d} n }{ \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\lambda } \\\\right) \\\\ . It turned out later that Fresnel's dragging coefficient is indeed in accordance with the relativistic velocity addition formula, see the section Derivation in special relativity.  Repetitions  Figure 5. Improved Fizeau type experiment by Michelson and Morley in 1886. Collimated light from source a falls on beam splitter b where it divides: one part follows the path b c d e f b g and the other the path b f e d c b g. Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) repeated Fizeau's experiment with improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized flow of water lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across the diameter of the tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common-path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results not just in water, but also in air. Other experiments were conducted by Pieter Zeeman in 1914‚Äì1915. Using a scaled-up version of Michelson's apparatus connected directly to Amsterdam's main water conduit, Zeeman was able to perform extended measurements using monochromatic light ranging from violet (4358 √Ö) through red (6870 √Ö) to confirm Lorentz's modified coefficient. In 1910, Franz Harress used a rotating device and overall confirmed Fresnel's dragging coefficient. However, he additionally found a \\"systematic bias\\" in the data, which later turned out to be the Sagnac effect. Since then, many experiments have been conducted measuring such dragging coefficients in a diversity of materials of differing refractive index, often in combination with the Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments. Also a transverse dragging effect was observed, i.e. when the medium is moving at right angles to the direction of the incident light.  Hoek experiment  An indirect confirmation of Fresnel's dragging coefficient was provided by Martin Hoek (1868). His apparatus was similar to Fizeau's, though in his version only one arm contained an area filled with resting water, while the other arm was in the air. As seen by an observer resting in the aether, Earth and hence the water is in motion. So the following travel times of two light rays traveling in opposite directions were calculated by Hoek (neglecting the transverse direction, see image): {|align=center t_{1}=\\\\frac{AB}{c+v}+\\\\frac{DE}{\\\\frac{c}{n}-v} \\\\ , t_{2}=\\\\frac{AB}{c-v}+\\\\frac{DE}{\\\\frac{c}{n}+v} \\\\ . Figure 6. Hoek expected the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the wind. In the actual experiment, he observed no banding regardless of the instrument's orientation. |} The travel times are not the same, which should be indicated by an interference shift. However, if Fresnel's dragging coefficient is applied to the water in the aether frame, the travel time difference (to first order in v/c) vanishes. Using different setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient. (For a similar experiment refuting the possibility of shielding the aether wind, see Hammar experiment). In the particular version of the experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600 mm with respect to the other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative. Controversy Although Fresnel's hypothesis was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading experts in the field, including Fizeau himself (1851), √âleuth√®re Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether would have to be dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time. Fizeau's dissatisfaction with the result of his own experiment is easily discerned in the conclusion to his report: > The success of the experiment seems to me to render the adoption of > Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, or at least the law which he found for the > expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of > motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very > strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which it is only a consequence, > perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some > respects so difficult, to admit, that other proofs and a profound > examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before > adopting it as an expression of the real facts of the case. Despite the dissatisfaction of most physicists with Fresnel's partial aether- dragging hypothesis, repetitions and improvements to his experiment (see sections above) by others confirmed his results to high accuracy. Besides the problems of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity. Lorentz's interpretation In 1892, Hendrik Lorentz proposed a modification of Fresnel's model, in which the aether is completely stationary. He succeeded in deriving Fresnel's dragging coefficient as the result of an interaction between the moving water with an undragged aether. He also discovered that the transition from one to another reference frame could be simplified by using an auxiliary time variable which he called local time: :t^{\\\\prime}=t-\\\\frac{vx}{c^{2}} \\\\ . In 1895, Lorentz more generally explained Fresnel's coefficient based on the concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work. Derivation in special relativity Einstein showed how Lorentz's equations could be derived as the logical outcome of a set of two simple starting postulates. In addition Einstein recognized that the stationary aether concept has no place in special relativity, and that the Lorentz transformation concerns the nature of space and time. Together with the moving magnet and conductor problem, the negative aether drift experiments, and the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment was one of the key experimental results that shaped Einstein's thinking about relativity. Robert S. Shankland reported some conversations with Einstein, in which Einstein emphasized the importance of the Fizeau experiment: Max von Laue (1907) demonstrated that the Fresnel drag coefficient can be easily explained as a natural consequence of the relativistic formula for addition of velocities, namely: :The speed of light in immobile water is c/n. :From the velocity composition law it follows that the speed of light observed in the laboratory, where water is flowing with speed v (in the same direction as light) is ::V_\\\\mathrm{lab}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{c}{n}+v}{1+\\\\frac{\\\\frac{c}{n}v}{c^2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{c}{n}+v}{1+\\\\frac{v}{cn}} \\\\ . :Thus the difference in speed is (assuming v is small comparing to c, dropping higher order terms) ::V_\\\\mathrm{lab}-\\\\frac{c}{n} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{c}{n}+v}{1+\\\\frac{v}{cn}}-\\\\frac{c}{n}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{c}{n}+v-\\\\frac{c}{n}(1+\\\\frac{v}{cn})}{1+\\\\frac{v}{cn}} = \\\\frac{v\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right)}{1+\\\\frac{v}{cn}}\\\\approx v\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right) \\\\ . :This is accurate when , and agrees with the formula based upon Fizeau's measurements, which satisfied the condition . Fizeau's experiment is hence supporting evidence for the collinear case of Einstein's velocity addition formula.

From age six until her death at age 14, Elizabeth was a prisoner of the English Parliament during the English Civil War. Her emotional written account of her final meeting with her father on the eve of his execution and his final words to his children have been published in numerous histories about the Civil War and Charles I.Unusual Historicals: Tragic Tales: The Lost Children of Charles I Failed betrothal Anne, painted by van Dyck. Elizabeth was born on 28 December 1635 at St James's Palace and was baptized there on 2 January the next year by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1636, Maria de' Medici, Elizabeth's maternal grandmother, attempted to have the infant princess betrothed to the son of the Prince of Orange, the future William II of Orange. Despite the fact that Charles I thought the marriage of an English princess to a Prince of Orange beneath her rank, the king's financial and political troubles forced him to send Elizabeth's sister, Mary, Princess Royal, to marry him instead. Civil war Henry, Duke of Gloucester, painted in 1653 by Adriaen Hanneman. On the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, Elizabeth, and her brother the Duke of Gloucester, were placed under the care of Parliament. Over the coming years, Parliament assigned their guardianships to several nobles, among them Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke. In 1642, Parliament assigned guardianship of Elizabeth and Henry to the Earl of Northumberland. That same year, their brother, James, Duke of York, the future James II, came to visit them. However, Elizabeth supposedly advised him to leave out of concern about their enemies. In 1643, the seven-year-old Elizabeth broke her leg. That same year, she and Henry moved to Chelsea. She was tutored by Bathsua Makin until 1644. By then, Elizabeth could read and write in Hebrew, Greek, Italian, Latin and French. Other prominent scholars dedicated works to her, and were amazed by her flair for religious reading. In 1647, Parliament allowed Elizabeth and her brothers Henry and James to travel to Maidenhead to meet their father Charles I and spent two days with him. After the Parliament moved Charles I to Hampton Court Palace, he visited his children under the care of the Northumberlands at Syon House. These visits ended when he fled to Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight; ten-year-old Elizabeth supposedly helped James to escape once again, dressed as a woman. Elizabeth's family called her \\"Temperance\\" for her kind nature. When she was eleven, the French ambassador described Elizabeth as a \\"budding young beauty\\" who had \\"grace, dignity, intelligence and sensibility\\" that enabled her to judge the different people she met and understand different points of view. Elizabeth suffered from poor health. A Victorian-era examination of her remains revealed that she had suffered from rickets, which caused shoulder and back deformities, knock knees and pigeon toes. These problems would have made it difficult for Elizabeth to walk. The adolescent Elizabeth had a long face with a protruding jaw and reddish-brown hair. When Parliament decided to remove Elizabeth's household in 1648, the 12-year-old princess wrote them a letter protesting their decision: \\"My Lords, I account myself very miserable that I must have my servants taken from me and strangers put to me. You promised me that you would have a care for me; and I hope you will show it in preventing so great a grief as this would be to me. I pray my lords consider of it, and give me cause to thank you, and to rest. Your loving friend, Elizabeth.\\" The Lords were sympathetic to Elizabeth's plight and condemned the Commons for intervening with the Royal Household, and overturned the decision. However, the Commons demanded that the royal children be brought up as strict Protestants; they were also forbidden to join the Court at Oxford, and were held virtual prisoners at St. James's Palace. At one point, Parliament considered making Henry a replacement king, but strictly a constitutional monarch. Execution of Charles I In 1649, Charles I was captured for the final time. Oliver Cromwell and the other judges immediately sentenced him to death. Elizabeth wrote a long letter to Parliament requesting permission to join her sister Mary in Holland. However, Parliament refused to grant this request until after the execution. On 29 January 1649, 13 year-old Elizabeth and Henry met with their father for the last time. She wrote an account of the meeting: \\"He told me he was glad I was come, and although he had not time to say much, yet somewhat he had to say to me which he had not to another, or leave in writing, because he feared their cruelty was such as that they would not have permitted him to write to me.\\" Elizabeth was reportedly crying so hard that Charles I asked her if she would be able to remember everything he told her. She promised never to forget and said she would record it in writing. She wrote two separate accounts of the meeting. Her father told her not to \\"grieve and torment herself for him\\" and asked her to keep her faith in the Protestant religion. Charles I told her to read certain books, among them Bishop Andrew's Sermons, Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity and Bishop Laud's book against Fisher, to ground her against \\"popery\\". Charles I also gave his daughter a Bible during the meeting. After the death of Charles I, Elizabeth and Henry became unwanted charges. Joceline, Lord Lisle, the Earl of Northumberland's son, petitioned Parliament to remove Elizabeth and Henry from the Northumberlands' care. Parliament refused to allow them to go to Holland, and instead placed the children in the care of Sir Edward Harrington; however, Harrington's son successfully pleaded that they be looked after elsewhere. Commonwealth The next residence for Elizabeth and Henry was Penshurst Place, under the care of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester and his wife Dorothy. Parliament had instructed the Sidneys not to spoil the children. However, Dorothy Sidney treated Elizabeth with great kindness; as a token of her appreciation, Elizabeth gave Dorothy a jewel from her own collection. The valuable jewel later became the centre of conflict between Dorothy and the Parliamentary commissioners appointed to oversee the late king's personal estate. In 1650, Elizabeth's brother, the now titular Charles II journeyed to Scotland to be crowned king of that country. In response, Parliament moved Elizabeth to the Isle of Wight in the care of Anthony Mildmay with a pension of ¬£3000 a year. Elizabeth complained that she was not well enough to travel, but her concerns were ignored. Death During the move to the Isle of Wight, Elizabeth caught a cold that quickly developed into pneumonia. She died on 8 September 1650, at Carisbrooke Castle. Some accounts say that Elizabeth was found dead with her head on the Bible from her father. In her last days, she was described as a sad child by those who had been around her. Three days after she was found dead, the Council of State granted permission for Elizabeth to join her sister Mary in the Netherlands. She was buried at St. Thomas's Church, Newport, on the Isle of Wight. Elizabeth's grave stone was only marked with the initials \\"ES\\" for Elizabeth Stuart. Two hundred years later, Queen Victoria, who had settled at Osborne House nearby, commissioned a white marble sculpture of Elizabeth by the sculptor Carlo Marochetti. The sculpture depicts Elizabeth as a beautiful young woman, lying with her cheek on a Bible. The Bible is open to words from the Gospel of Matthew: \\"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\\" Above the sculpture is a grating, indicating that Elizabeth was a prisoner; however, the bars are broken to show that the prisoner has now escaped to \\"a greater rest.\\"The Princess Elizabeth Memorial in the Lady Chapel at Newport Minster The plaque on the sculpture reads: \\"To the memory of The Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Charles I, who died at Carisbrooke Castle on 8 September 1650, and is interred beneath the chancel of this church, this monument is erected as a token of respect for her virtues and of sympathy for her misfortunes, by Victoria R., 1856.\\"The Roxburghe Ballads, Vol. 7, by William Chappell, Ballad Society The concluding lines from The Death of The Princess Elizabeth in the 1866 book Lays of the English Cavaliers by John Jeremiah Daniel commemorated Victoria's actions: Ancestors Notes References  Green, M.

It contains the Fruin Water which flows into the loch, and a road, now the A817 road, known as the Glen Fruin Haul Road, which goes from the A82 up the glen and over the top of the hills to HMNB Clyde at Garelochhead. It was originally built as a temporary private road on land leased from Luss Estates to facilitate construction of the Trident facility at RNAD Coulport thus avoiding heavy vehicles using narrow roads on the Roseneath Peninsula. After lobbying by the local authority it was agreed that it would be upgraded to adoptable standard and opened as a public Road. It was the site of the Battle of Glen Fruin, one of the last clan battles in Scotland, in which an estimated 300 warriors on foot from the MacGregor Clan claimed victory over an estimated 600-800 men from the Colquhoun Clan on horse-back.

There are three successive models: the RZ67 Professional (first model released in 1982), RZ67 Professional II (released in 1993) and RZ67 Professional IID (released in 2004). RZ67 is a modular camera system, meaning lenses, viewfinders, ground glasses, film winders and film backs are all interchangeable. It is primarily designed for studio use, but can also be used in the field. The RZ67 Sekor lenses have built-in electronic leaf shutters which are cocked and triggered from the body. Focusing is performed with a bellows on the body instead of the lenses. The camera accepts 6√ó7, 6√ó6 and 6√ó4.5, 120 and 220 film magazines and Polaroid as well as Quadra 72 4√ó5 sheet film backs. Mamiya RB67 backs are also supported via the G-Adapter. The film speed is set on each RZ back via a dial. There are two versions of the 6√ó7 and 6√ó4.5 backs; the model II versions have a second film counter to always show the film count on the top. The RZ67 operates on one 6 V silver oxide 4SR44 battery, or 6 V 4LR44 alkaline battery. It can be used in emergency mode fully mechanically with a fixed 1/400 sec shutter speed. Multiple exposures are possible in the M-mode. Mirror flip up is supported. The body has one standard flash hot shoe on its left side, one plug for a standard remote shutter cable release, and a socket for an electronic shutter trigger. The RZ67 measures 104 mm (W) √ó 133.5 mm (H) √ó 211.5 mm (L) with the 110mm lens, and weighs approximately 2.4 kg (5.29 lbs). The flange distance is 105 mm. The RZ67 name is adopted from the model name of the Mamiya RB67 (in which RB stands for \\"Revolving Back\\"), which was first introduced in 1970, thus the RZ67 also takes backs which can be rotated 90 degrees to provide a horizontal or vertical composition. The orientation is shown in the viewfinder with black guides. The viewfinder also hosts LEDs informing of the state of the camera (flash ready, low battery, dark slide not removed, shutter not cocked). In addition to manual operation (photographer chooses aperture and shutter speed), the RZ67 is able to operate in AEF mode with an AE viewfinder (AE being an abbreviation for automatic exposure), which transmits exposure information directly to the body. In RBL compatibility mode, the RZ67 is able to use RB67 lenses. The biggest difference between RB67 and RZ67 is that the RB67 is completely mechanical. The RZ67 has also mechanical couplings between the parts, but the shutter is electronic, and parts are able to transmit exposure information with electronic couplings. In addition, the RZ67 has plastic exterior body, which makes it somewhat lighter. Versions Original RZ67 Professional (RZ67 Pro I): * Electronic shutter 8 sec: sec with full EV steps RZ67 Professional II (RZ67 Pro II): * Some improvements of the electronics * An additional knob was added to the right side of the focusing unit for fine tuning of the focus * Shutter can be adjusted in 0.5 EV steps RZ67 Professional IID (RZ67 Pro IID): * Has an integrated interface for communicating with digital backs (the earlier versions need either an interface plate or external triggering wires) * Minor internal mechanical improvements File:Mamiya RZ67 Professional body.jpg|RZ67 Pro I File:Mamiya RZ67 Professional II body.jpg|RZ67 Pro II, not much exterior difference between the models except the Pro II version has a critical focus knob.

In \\"B\\" mode, the RZ67 models will expose up to 30 seconds (a warning beep will sound for the last 10 seconds). In \\"T\\" mode, the camera can expose indefinitely without drawing power from the battery. Most lenses, except for the 37 mm, 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 77 mm filter threads on the front of the lens. The 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 105 mm filter threads. Some lenses have a floating element; focusing these lenses involves setting a subject distance ring on the lens after focusing with the bellows.

It was the last film directed by acclaimed film noir director Jules Dassin. O'Neal - sixteen at the time of filming - posed for a topless scene. The film has been distributed by B-movie company Troma Entertainment. It has also been distributed under the title \\"Obsession.\\" The film was shot in Toronto.

Critical reception Circle of Two received mostly negative reviews at the time of its release.

He studied at Union College, Schenectady, New York, receiving his degree in 1804. Brownell was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood by Bishop John Henry Hobart. He was consecrated Bishop of Connecticut in New Haven on October 27, 1819. Brownell's extensive writings include diocesan charges, liturgical material, scriptural commentaries and other works. He founded Washington College (now known as Trinity College), Hartford as a faith-based college and served as its first president for nearly a decade. Brownell served as Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church from 1852 until his death, succeeding Philander Chase. Brownell was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery, next to Samuel and Elizabeth Colt. Brownell had presided over their wedding in 1856. Statue Brownell‚Äôs son-in-law Gordon Burnham commissioned artist Chauncey Ives to design a larger-than-life bronze statue of Brownell to be placed at Brownell's grave in Cedar Hill Cemetery. It was cast in 1869 by the foundry of Ferdinand von Miller of Munich. Burnham decided to donate the statue to Trinity College instead. The statue was first erected November 11, 1869, overlooking Bushnell Park, at the original site of the college. It was moved in 1878 to the main quadrangle of the new Trinity Campus.

Ramayyan Dalawa Early life Ramayyan, was born in Yerwadi, a village in Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu to which his family originally belonged. When he was six years of age his poor father gave up his native village and came to Thiruvattar and settled at a hamlet known as Aruvikara in the Kalkulam Taluka in the modern-day Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu state. When he was twenty years old he lost his parents, who he survived along with their other three sons and one daughter. After the death of his parents Ramayyan frequently visited Trivandrum, attracted to it by the never ending festivities and celebrations, which always drew great crowds of Tamil Brahmins from all over Travancore and neighbouring regions of modern-day Tamil Nadu. On one occasion he decided to stay back and seek some employment in Trivandrum in which, owing to his superior intelligence and ability, he was successful. He was employed as an assistant to the Attiyara Pohtty Brahmin of Vanchiyoor, a member of the Ettara Yogam or the Council of Eight and a Half who controlled the Temple of Padmanabhapuram and a man of great power and influence. Association with the Maharajah While employed with the Attiyara Pohtty one evening, when the Maharajah Marthanda Varma was dining at Attiyara, he noticed Ramayyan who impressed him by dealing with a minor yet significant incident with great sense and intelligence. The pleased Marthanda Varma asked the Attiyara Pohtty to let him take the young boy into his service which being permitted Ramayyan became a servant of the Maharajah of Travancore. Career Ramayyan from being appointed at a minor post in the Palace management soon rose in the Maharajah's favour and was appointed Palace Rayasom or Under Secretary wherein he fulfilled his duties ably. Thus when the then Dalawa or Dewan of Travancore, Arumukham Pillai, died in the year 1736, Ramayyan was appointed Dalawa by the very impressed Maharajah Marthanda Varma. Military conquests The entire territorial extent of Travancore state namely between the River Periyar and Cape Comorin was attained with the efforts of Ramayyan Dalawa on behalf of his King Marthanda Varma. It was due to his efforts and conquests that the kingdoms of Kayamkulam, Madathinkoor (Mavelikkara), Elayadathu Swaroopam, Quilon, Ambalapuzha etc. were annexed to Travancore and the Dutch were defeated in the Battle of Colachel. Several favourable treaties were signed with the British under his Dalawaship while the Kingdom of Cochin and the Zamorin accepted the suzerainty of Travancore. Family Ramayyan Dalawa's two sons and one daughter moved back to Tamil Nadu after his death. His family finally settled in the erstwhile Pudukkottai state (a Princely State in Tamil Nadu). The then king of Pudukkotta, who had a good rapport with the Travancore state, offered Dalawa's descendants the entire village of Sithanavasal. Death Ramayyan Dalawa resided in the town of Mavelikkara where he had a palace built by Marthanda Varma. After the death of his wife, Ramayyan married a Malayala unnithan lady from Mavelikkara of the Edassery family . After his death Ramayyan's descendants left to Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu and settled there. His mayali wife was given gifts and presents and special allowances from the Travancore government in recognition of his services to the state while his own descendants were bestowed with the honorific title of Dalawa. The able Dalawa breathed his last in the year 1756. Marthanda Varma was terribly saddened by his death, and finally followed his faithful servant in 1758. The last Diwan of Travancore is from this family, Sri PGN Unnithan hailed from the Edassery Pattaveettil Family of Mavelikkara which had a history of high military service to the Travancore Royal Family. His father Ittamar Koil Thampuran was from the Haripad Palace and nephew of Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran. Relations with Marthanda Varma The Maharajah Marthanda Varma and Ramayyan Dalawa were more than just king and minister to each other. They were intimate friends (like Chandragupta Maurya and Chanakya), so much that after the death of Ramayyan the Maharajah became depressed and declined in health prior to his death in 1758. Ramayyan Dalawa was one of the ablest and most popular ministers of Travancore and while on his death bed when asked how he would want his memory perpetuated he merely stated that he was an \\"instrument in the hands of my master (Marthanda Varma) and had no such ambitions.\\" Enmity between Ramayyan Dalawa and Nampoothiris of Kayamkulam Ramayyan Dalawa was the main enemy of the Nampoothiris of Travancore who lived in Kayamkulam and nearby places. During the Kayamkulam war, Ramayyan Dalawa attacked and looted the Nambiathiris, high order Nampoothiris having the knowledge of Dhanurveda‚Äîthe science of arms in ancient times‚Äîand who were the local rulers of 'Swaroopams', a small area covering five or six villages, and the owners of temples in this region for defeating Kayamkulam as there were well trained armies of Nairs under each Nambiathiris . After winning the battle with Kayamkulam, Ramayyan downgraded them. As a protest, many Nampoothiris left and went to northern places and lived as Nampoothiris. Many of the Nampoothiris remained at Kayamkulam, Oachira, Mavelikkara and Haripad were down graded as 'Nambiathis' the 'purohithas' of local Nairs. In the meantime a new group of Brahmins were brought to these places from the Kolathu Nadu and posted as priests in many temples in these regions . They were called Thiruvalla Desis by the locals or simply Thiruvalla potties and later they were given the status of Nampoothiris during the beginning of 'Kollavarsham' 1109. Thus the erstwhile Nampoothiris in this region became second grade Nampoothiris and known as Nambiathis and as a result they hated Ramayyan Dalawa. Ward and Corner, two British surveyors who conducted a survey in erstwhile Travancore and Cochin at the beginning of 19th century observed that many Nampoothiris of Kayamkulam and surroundings migrated to northern Kerala during Ramayyan Dalawa's time.

It was released in the UK, Ireland and USA in January 2008. The novel was shortlisted for the 2009 Carnegie Medal.2009 Carnegie shortlist Colfer was inspired to write the book after a frightening skydiving experience. He combined this with his childhood observation that the Saltee Islands would make an excellent prison. Most of the story is fictional. The Saltee Islands have been uninhabited since the 19th century and all of the main characters in the story are fictional. Plot The book begins with the Paris World's Fair of 1878, which Declan Broekhart and his wife, Catherine, are attending. They are there mainly to take a ride in a new hot air balloon. While they are in the air, along with one Victor Vigny, the balloon is shot at by men from the ground. During the forced landing, Conor Broekhart is born, flying over Paris. It is 1887. Conor and his family live on the sovereign Saltee Islands, off the Irish coast, which are ruled by King Nicholas Trudeau. Nicholas is a progressive leader who is helping the islands adapt to the industrialized world. When a dangerous fire traps young Conor and his friend Isabella (the king's daughter) on top of a tower's roof, he saves both their lives by making a makeshift glider anew to fly, and exploring the castle with Princess Isabella. He is obsessed with building a \\"flying machine\\". Unfortunately, the head of the island's guards, Marshall Hugo Bonvilain, conspires to overthrow Nicholas and seize control of the Saltees. His goal is to turn the islands into a market for the diamonds mined by inmates on the prison island, Little Saltee. Despite Conor's attempt to intervene, Nicholas and Victor are killed by Marshall Bonvilain. Marshall Bonvilain takes control of the islands and tells his subjects that Victor conspired to kill King Nicholas and Conor tried to save the King, but died in the effort. Conor, however, does not know this, and instead thinks that Bonivilain has told his family that he was involved in the plot to kill the King. Conor is thrown into jail on Little Saltee, under the alias Conor Finn. His family and friends believe he is dead. Conor's cellmate, Linus Wynter, an American musician and spy, helps Conor adapt to prison life. Before long, Conor begins to make deals with a guard named Arthur Billtoe and gangsters called the Battering Rams. Linus soon mysteriously disappears, and Conor believes him dead, as he was told Linus was released, and \\"release\\" on Little Saltee comes only with death. Two years pass and Conor is 16. He persuades Billtoe to plant gardens for inmates to work in. Conor and Otto Malarkey, a Battering Ram, smuggle seven bags of diamonds and hide them in the gardens. Meanwhile, Conor tricks Billtoe into getting him bed sheets and other materials using an invention and a few good ideas. Unbeknownst to Billtoe, Conor is using these materials to plan a grand escape during the coronation of Isabella, now old enough to become Queen of the Saltees. The coronation and the arrival of Queen Victoria are approaching and Conor constructs a parachute. He persuades Billtoe to suggest that during the coronation, several hot air balloons are filled with fireworks and released from Little Saltee so that the famous Saltee sharpshooters can shoot the balloons for a grand fireworks display. During the coronation ceremony, Conor escapes from his cell and plants himself in one of the fireworks balloons. When his balloon is shot down, Conor activates his parachute and crash-lands in Queen Victoria's yacht. A stowaway on Queen Victoria's private yacht, he makes it safely to Kilmore, the Irish village overlooking the Saltees. There he discovers Linus Wynter, still alive. The pair finds a tower full of aviation equipment that was once Victor Vigny's laboratory. Conor constructs a hang-glider and adopts the persona of the Airman, a flying French swordsman. By night, Conor makes flights to Little Saltee, terrorizing the guards and digging up his bags of smuggled diamonds. Conor's goal is to use the diamonds to start a new life in the United States of America. Conor's plans are interrupted when Bonvilain finds Conor's tower and harms Linus. Linus learns that Bonvilain intends to overthrow the monarchy again by poisoning Isabella and her greatest supporters, Conor's mother and father. Conor hears this information and decided he must save his family and the queen. He constructs the flying machine he has always dreamed of, a one-man aeroplane powered by an internal-combustion engine, and flies to Bonvilain's tower. There, he is reunited with Isabella and his family. Conor, Isabella, and Conor's father, Declan, engage Bonvilain and his guards in a sword fight. They are victorious. Bonvilain tries escaping on Conor's hang-glider, but is pierced through the heart by a ceremonial sword used by Declan and his dead body, still attached to the glider, glides towards the sea submerging him forever. One month later, Queen Isabella is seeking reform. She has reduced taxes and intends to free the prisoners and hand Little Saltee over to a professional mining firm. Conor is ready to leave for Glasgow University to study for a science degree and kisses Isabella. The Forlorn Tower is in the good hands of \\"Uncle\\" (a street boy Conor befriended) and two of his pack. Linus is to live with Conor as well. Film adaptation A film adaptation for the book utilizing motion- capture was announced in September 2008. It was set to be directed by Gil Kenan and produced by Robert Zemeckis through his joint venture with Walt Disney Pictures, ImageMovers Digital.

A Skylark tower is a tower used for the launch of earlier versions of Skylark rockets. As Skylark rockets have no guidance system and accelerate slowly, they require a safe launch tower with a height of at least 24 metres with a guidance system. Later versions of the Skylark rocket were equipped with a more powerful engine and therefore did not need such a large guidance tower for launch. Woomera In 1956, a 30 metre tall swivelling launch tower was set up on launch site 2, at Woomera, South Australia. The tower was built of old Bailey bridge segments, each weighing 35 tons. Salto di Quirra At Salto di Quirra, Sardinia in 1965, a 30 metre tall Skylark tower was erected. The tower ceased to be in use from 1972, at which point launches moved to Esrange. The tower remains today. Esrange At Esrange, Sweden in 1972, a 30 metre high Skylark tower was built. The tower consists of a pyramid-like building with a launch tower on its top, in order to protect the rocket from cold before launch, necessary as Esrange is within the Arctic Circle. At launch, exhaust doors were opened to enable the smoke to leave the construct. As Skylark rockets are no longer available, the Esrange Skylark launch tower was modified in 2005 for launching Brazilian VSB-30 rockets. The tower is now used for launches of rockets manufactured in Brazil.  References  * Description in DORADO, Jos√© M. Spain and the European Space Effort.

Early life Onderdonk was born in New York City.Batterson, 94 He studied at Columbia University, receiving his degree in 1805, and then traveled to Britain for further education, receiving his medical degree from the University of Edinburgh. On returning to the United States, Onderdonk practiced medicine in New York before being ordained to the deaconate and priesthood by Bishop John Henry Hobart. In 1816, he went to western New York as a missionary and then returned east to become rector of St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn, remaining there for seven years. Bishop of Pennsylvania Onderdonk was elected assistant Bishop of Pennsylvania in 1827, serving initially as assistant to Bishop William White.Batterson, 95 He was the 21st bishop of the ECUSA, and was consecrated by bishops William White, Alexander Viets Griswold, and James Kemp. However, bishop Kemp died of injuries received in a stage coach accident while returning from the consecration, so Onderdonk substituted in the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland until a successor was elected.George Freeman Bragg, The First Negro Priest on Southern Soil (Baltimore: Church Advocate Press, 1909) p. 13, available at google books On Bishop White's death in 1836, Onderdonk succeeded him as bishop. Onderdonk was a strong advocate of the pre-Tractarian High Church position, in company with his brother Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk, who was also a bishop. When Rev. Alexander Crummell petitioned to be allowed to move to Pennsylvania to establish another church (besides the peripatetic St. Thomas congregation) to serve Philadelphia's African-American community, Bishop Onderdonk reportedly replied, \\"I will receive you into this diocese on one condition: No negro priest can sit in my church convention and no negro church must ask for representation there.\\" Crummell reportedly paused for a moment before declining.Du Bois, W.E.B The Souls of Black Folk, p. 139. In 1844, Onderdonk was suspended from the exercise of his episcopal office after rumors of alcoholism. The suspension was lifted in 1856, two years before his death. He is buried in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.

Between In Town in 1892 and The Maid of the Mountains, premiering in 1917, this new style of musical theatre became dominant on the musical stage in Britain and the rest of the English-speaking world. The popularity of In Town and A Gaiety Girl (1893), led to an astonishing number of hits over the next three decades, the most successful of which included The Shop Girl (1894), The Geisha (1896), Florodora (1899), A Chinese Honeymoon (1901), The Earl and the Girl (1903), The Arcadians (1909), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Quaker Girl (1910), Betty (1914), Chu Chin Chow (1916) and The Maid of the Mountains (1917). History Edwardian musical comedy began in the last decade of the Victorian era and captured the optimism, energy and good humour of the new century and the Edwardian era, as well as providing comfort during the First World War. The Gaiety Theatre's well-loved but racy burlesques were coming to the end of their popularity, and so was the run of phenomenally successful family-friendly Gilbert and Sullivan operas. These two genres had dominated the musical stage since the 1870s. A few lighter, more romantic comic operas, beginning with Dorothy (1886) found success and showed that audiences wanted something lighter than operetta, but more coherent in construction than burlesque, that featured the modern fashions and culture of the day.Ganzl, Kurt, \\"Musicals\\", London: Carlton (1995), p. 56 ; Hyman, Alan, \\"The Gaiety Years\\", London: Cassell (1975), p. 64 George Edwardes The father of the Edwardian musical was George 'The Guv'nor' Edwardes. He took over the Gaiety Theatre in the 1880s and, at first, improved the quality of the old Gaiety Theatre burlesques. Perceiving that their time had passed, he experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle. These drew on the traditions of Savoy opera and also used elements of burlesque and of Americans Harrigan and Hart. Their plots were simple, and they included elaborate displays of contemporary fashion and settings, and lighthearted parody of modern social convention and topical issues.Traubner, Richard. Operetta: A Theatrical History, pp. 198‚Äì219, Routledge, 2003 He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \\"respectable\\" corps of dancing, singing Gaiety Girls who wore the latest fashions, and also showed off their bodies in chorus lines and bathing attire, as well as singing, to complete the musical and visual fun. These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres and then in America. George Edwardes The first Edwardian musical comedy was In Town in 1892. Its success, together with the even greater sensation of A Gaiety Girl in 1893, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.\\"Gaiety Theatre\\" , ArthurLloyd theatre site\\"Musical Comedy\\" , Musicals Tour at PeoplePlayUK theatre site These \\"musical comedies\\", as he called them, revolutionized the London stage and set the tone for the next three decades. According to musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb, \\"The British Empire and America began to fall for the appeal of the [Edwardian] musical comedy from the time when A Gaiety Girl was taken on a world tour in 1894.\\"Lamb, Andrew. \\"From Pinafore to Porter: United States- United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879‚Äì1929\\", American Music, Vol. 4, No. 1, British-American Musical Interactions (Spring, 1986), pp. 34-49, University of Illinois Press, retrieved September 18, 2008 Edwardes' early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic \\"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\\" shows, usually with the word \\"Girl\\" in the title. After A Gaiety Girl came The Shop Girl (1894), The Circus Girl (1896) and A Runaway Girl (1898). The heroines were independent young women who often earned their own livings. The stories followed a familiar plot line - a chorus girl breaks into high society, a shop girl makes a good marriage. There was always a misunderstanding during act one and an engagement at the end.Coward, Noel. Foreword to Musical Comedy by Raymond Mander and Joe Mitchenson (New York: Taplinger Publishing, 1969), pp. 7-8 In the words of a contemporary review, Edwardes‚Äô musicals were \\"Light, bright and enjoyable.\\" Later Gaiety Theatre \\"girl\\" musicals included The Orchid (1903), The Spring Chicken (1905), The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Sunshine Girl (1912) and The Girl on the Film (1913). Perhaps to balance the \\"girl\\" musicals, the Gaiety also presented a series of what could be described as \\"boy\\" musicals, such as The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador (1901), The New Aladdin (1906) and Theodore and Co. (1916). Edwardes expanded his empire to other theatres and presented slightly more complex comedy hits beginning with An Artist's Model (1895). The Geisha (1896) and San Toy (1899) each ran for more than two years and found great international success, capitalizing on the British craze for all things oriental.Richards, Jeffrey. Imperialism and Music: Britain, 1876-1953, pp. 262‚Äì66, Manchester University Press (2001) Other Edwardes hits included The Girl from Kays (1902), The Earl and the Girl (1903) and The Quaker Girl (1910). Composers, writers, producers and stars The chief glories of Edwardian musical comedies lie in their musical scores. At their best, these combined the delicacy and sophistication of operetta with the robust tunefulness of the music hall. The major composers of the genre were Sidney Jones (The Geisha), Ivan Caryll (Our Miss Gibbs), Lionel Monckton (The Quaker Girl), Howard Talbot (A Chinese Honeymoon), Leslie Stuart (Florodora) and Paul Rubens (Miss Hook of Holland). Scores were constantly refreshed with \\"additional\\" or \\"specialty\\" numbers and re-arranged, often by several different composers and lyricists, to keep audiences coming back. Important writers included Adrian Ross, Harry Greenbank, Percy Greenbank, Owen Hall, Charles H. Taylor and Oscar Asche. Generally, the book, lyrics and music were each written by different people, which was a first for the musical stage, although now this is the usual way of doing things. Adrian Ross wrote the lyrics for well over 50 Edwardian musicals. Phyllis Dare in The Arcadians Besides Edwardes, American producer Charles Frohman and actor-managers like Seymour Hicks, Robert Evett and George Grossmith, Jr. were responsible for many of these shows. The musicals were frequently built around a resident company of artists, and the greatest stars of the era included actresses Marie Tempest, Gertie Millar, Lily Elsie, Ellaline Terriss and Phyllis Dare, leading men such as Hayden Coffin and Harry Grattan, and comics such as Rutland Barrington, George Grossmith, Jr., Huntley Wright and Edmund Payne. One critic wrote of Joseph Coyne that, like other stars of musical comedy, \\"It is no good their pretending to be any one else. We go to see themselves, and all we ask is that the authors and others shall give them every chance of being themselves in the most pronounced and personal fashion\\".\\"Royal Adelphi Theatre\\", The Times, 7 November 1910, p. 16 Examples The Arcadians is generally regarded as the masterpiece of the genre.Ganzl, Kurt (1995), p. 72. The composers were Monckton and Talbot, both at the height of their powers. The story, about the havoc wreaked when truth-telling Arcadians arrive in corrupt London, neatly parallels the position of Edwardian musical comedies in theatrical history, with operetta-singing Arcadians, representing the past, meeting with music hall-singing Londoners, representing the future. This is an example of a common feature of shows of this period: sophistication with a common touch. Florodora (1899) by Leslie Stuart and Paul Rubens made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did A Chinese Honeymoon (1901), by British lyricist George Dance and American-born composer Howard Talbot, which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of The Mikado). Later enormously popular hits included Chu Chin Chow (1916), which ran for 2,238 performances (more than twice as many as any previous musical),Compilation of longest-running plays in history List of longest-running plays in London and New York from 1875 to 1920 Theodore & Co (1916), The Boy (1917), Yes, Uncle! (1917) and The Maid of the Mountains (1917, the second longest-running Edwardian musical, with 1,352 performances). Audiences wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it.Chu Chin Chow , Musical Theatre Guided Tour (PeoplePlay UK), accessed October 3, 2008 George M.

He is particularly known for his novels and short stories, although he also wrote poems and plays. Life Fran Sale≈°ki Fin≈ægar was born into a poor peasant family in the Upper Carniolan village of Doslovƒçe, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After finishing primary education in the town of Radovljica, he attended secondary school in Ljubljana between 1882 and 1891, continuing his education at the theological college. He was ordained priest in 1894 and worked in various parishes in Upper Carniola and Ljubljana until 1936, when he retired. He died in Ljubljana at the age of 91 and was buried at the ≈Ωale cemetery. Politically, Fin≈ægar was close to the Christian Socialist ideals of the Slovenian Catholic political activist and leader Janez Evangelist Krek. He was also an admirer and friend of the Social Democratic author Ivan Cankar, whom he even catered at his deathbed in 1918. During World War II, he collaborated with the Communist-led Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, which led him to some conflict with the then bishop of Ljubljana, Gregorij Ro≈æman. The Fin≈ægar House in Doslovƒçe was frequented by many intellectuals from the area, particularly by his best friend Izidor Cankar, an influential art historian and manager. The ethnologist Janez Bogataj, whose mother was Fin≈ægar's niece, spent his first 15 years in Fin≈ægar's company and arranged his birth house for public in 1971. Fin≈ægar's close friend and personal advisor was also the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. When Fin≈ægar served as a priest in the parish of Trnovo in Ljubljana, Pleƒçnik was his neighbour. In the late 1920s, Fin≈ægar commissioned the renovation of the Trnovo parish church to his architect friend. Work Fin≈ægar started his literary career as a poet, but later turned to prose. He wrote novels in the Neo-Romantic style, depicting rural and small town life. He is best known for his patriotic historical novel ' (), written between 1906 and 1907. It was partially modelled after Sienkiewicz and based on . It was set in the 6th century AD and depicted the conflict between South Slavic tribes and the degenerate Byzantine Empire. Fin≈ægar also wrote short stories and tales for children, the best known of which is Mister Torrent (). It is a eulogy to nature, written as a set of adventures of a clerk from Ljubljana in the Karawanks. In addition, he wrote a number of plays, none of them particularly successful. He translated several works of the Austrian poet Peter Rosegger, whom he admired, into Slovene. He was the editor of the family magazine Mladika (The Shoot) and member of the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1939, Fin≈ægar the arrangement of the Pre≈°eren House, the birth house of France Pre≈°eren in Vrba, a village near Doslovƒçe. It was opened as a museum on 21 May that year. In 1940, the Pre≈°eren House and the village were filmed for the black and white sound documentary O, Vrba. It was directed by and produced in 1941.

It is the sequel to the novel The Sparrow.  Plot summary  Father Emilio Sandoz is a Jesuit priest who has returned to Earth and is recovering from his experiences on the planet Rakhat (detailed in The Sparrow). He is exposed to Father Vincenzo Giuliani's organized crime \\"family,\\" the Camorra. At a christening celebration, he meets Celestina, aged four, and her mother Gina, a divorcee with whom Emilio begins to fall in love. Emilio is released from the priesthood. He trains the second Jesuit expedition to Rakhat, composed of Sean Fein, Danny Iron Horse, and John Candotti, in the K'San (Jana'ata) and Ruanja (Runa) languages. Sandoz refuses to go. Gina is about to go on vacation, after which Emilio plans to marry her. Unfortunately, while Gina is on vacation, Emilio is beaten and kidnapped by Carlo, Gina's ex-husband and Celestina's father. Emilio is kept in a constantly drugged state on Carlo's ship, the Giordano Bruno. They are actually working for the Jesuits and the Vatican, who want Sandoz to return to Rakhat. It is extremely important that the Jesuits put right (as much as possible) what they destroyed on Rakhat; the massacre of the first landing party and the violent revolution of the Runa serving class that followed, have caused a rift between the Society of Jesus and the rest of the Catholic Church. In fact, the Jesuit order has all but vanished completely. Back on Rakhat, there is an unexpected survivor of the massacre; Sofia Mendes Quinn, grievously injured but her pregnancy intact, has been hidden from the Jana'ata patrols at a concealed village called Trucha Sai (\\"forget us\\"). She commands Runa troops in the revolution and is their Joan of Arc figure. She has been sending packets of information back to the initial Earth voyage's asteroid ship Stella Maris, still in orbit around Rakhat, as was the normal practice of the original landing party. She has her baby with help from the locals. Soon, it is apparent that her son, Isaac, is autistic. He is most comfortable alone in natural environments, and she educates him via her computer tablet. Sometime later, the signal from the Stella Maris becomes inactive, but Sofia does not guess that it is because other Earthmen‚Äîthe United Nations Contact Consortium‚Äîcame to Rakhat and sent the ship home, let alone that Emilio Sandoz had been rescued and was aboard, headed back for the lengthy inquisition covered in The Sparrow. Up in Inbrokar's ornate capital city Galatna, Hlavin Kitheri, the Jana'ata Reshtar (third-born prince), has fulfilled his promise to ambitious tradesman Supaari. When Supaari gave Emilio to Hlavin as a gift, Hlavin arranged a marriage between Supaari and his sister, Jholaa. Having lived all her life in strict purdah and enforced ignorance, she is not even told of their plans until the wedding is actually occurring. The ceremony includes consummation in front of everyone ‚Äî actually rape in this case, because Jholaa was unprepared for marriage and did not desire Supaari. She detests him, and when she has a daughter, Supaari is told that the infant is deformed, and by tradition he must kill it. But on first glance he can see it is a lie, and a set-up ‚Äî a practical joke by Hlavin, to wipe out Supaari's new family line before it can begin. Remembering Anne, the doctor of the human landing party who became his friend, he names his little girl Ha'anala, \\"like Anne\\". Taking her, he leaves behind everything and goes to his family. There, he recognizes that he has no place among the Jana'ata. The Runa of Kashan village, where the revolution began, offer to keep him safe as a hasta'akala (total dependent). He has worked with them for decades, selling their merchandise in the city of Gayjur. By law, a hasta'akala's patron must provide all his food. The Runa have been bred for many centuries as not only servants but food for the Jana'ata; but the vaKashani love Supaari to the point of volunteering to die for him and the child to eat (reflecting Jesus' Eucharistic sacrifice, the most important sacrament in Catholicism). Supaari refuses their kind offer. Instead he takes Ha'anala to where Sofia is and becomes a spy, aiding in the extermination of his own species. Ha'anala is a brilliant, inquisitive little girl whom Sofia educates as she would any Jewish child. One day, Isaac leaves. Ha'anala finds him, but she recognizes that he will not go back, so she accompanies him. They stumble upon a group of Jana'ata people in the N'Jarr Valley in the mountains and stay with them. Ha'anala later marries Shetri Laaks, one of these people, and has many children, although several of them die due to malnutrition; Ha'anala refuses to eat Runa. Hlavin Kitheri, inspired partly by his encounter with Sandoz, begins to revolutionize Jana'ata society by abolishing the stultifying hierarchies, even establishing a sort of democracy. He seizes the Paramountcy, the highest office in Inbrokar, by killing his entire family and framing Supaari for the murders. One of his first steps is to educate all the women. He hears of an extraordinary Jana'ata female, Suukmel. She advises him; he wants her, but she refuses to give him more than the chance to foster a child, Rukuei, with her. In the terrible war that follows, Hlavin fights Supaari in hand-to-hand combat, without armor. Both die in the prelude to the epic loss of Inbrokar to the Runa. Suukmel departs with Rukuei and finds the N'Jarr Valley. There Jana'ata and Runa work together, trying to build a new culture based on individual choice. The Jana'ata there believe they must find food other than Runa, but many are starving. There are game animals they could hunt, but they run the risk of being captured and killed by the Runa. Emilio Sandoz returns to Rakhat aboard the Giordano Bruno to find that the Runa have killed nearly all the Jana'ata and taken control of the planet for themselves. The Jesuits expected they would have to assist the Runa in their war for independence, but the Runa have won independently. Sofia talks to Emilio. The N'Jarr Valley is found, and Sofia sends Runa troops there, convinced that Ha'anala is keeping Isaac, now 40, captive. Isaac is staying there by his own choice, continuing a long-term project on his mother's old computer tablet. Ha'anala dies in childbirth, but Sandoz saves the baby. The Jesuit Danny Iron Horse, a Lakota, works with Suukmel to arrange an Indian reservation-like setup for the remaining Jana'ata on Rakhat. In the end, Emilio and the Mafiosi return to Earth on the Giordano Bruno, bringing with them Rukuei Kitheri, a poet. Sofia dies, and Suukmel stays in the N'Jarr Valley with Ha'anala's children and Isaac, who thinks he has found proof of the existence of God in patterns of music created by overlapping the genomes of all three sentient species (this has been his mysterious lifelong project). Sandoz comes home. Time has passed ‚Äî Gina is dead. At her grave, he is greeted by a lady who reveals herself as Gina's second daughter as well as his own daughter.  Literary significance and reception  A reviewer from the Library Journal said that Children of God \\"examines the problem of faith under fire with insight and clarity\\". A Publishers Weekly review determined Russell \\"uses the entertaining plot to explore sociological, spiritual, and scientific questions. Misunderstandings between cultures and peoples are at the heart of her story\\". Reviewing the novel in National Catholic Reporter, novelist Valerie Sayers felt that Children of God focuses on the problem of evil. She was critical of the author's tone but praised her prose style. The steady rate of shouting and imploring is rough indicator of the melodrama level. The minor characters tend to the stereotype. Finally she said \\"Russell's keen intelligence and scientific knowledge shine through often enough to make Children of God appealing often enough to make me wish she had dispensed with the least satisfying conventions of the genre\\".

Lake P√§ij√§nne from Paasivuori hill in Central Finland. Finnish Lakeland or Finnish lake district (, \\"Lake Finland\\", ) is the largest of the four landscape regions into which the geography of Finland is divided. The hilly, forest-covered landscape of the lake plateau is dominated by drumlins and by long sinuous eskers. Both are glacial remnants after the continental glaciers that scoured and gouged the country's surface receded about 10,000 years ago. The lake basins of the lakeland originate from the joint work of weathering and erosion of fractures in the bedrock. The erosion that made the depressions occurred before and during the Quaternary ice ages. Erosion along fractures has produced linear inlets among the lakes. Demarcation The district occupies most of the central and East Finland and is bounded to the south by the Salpausselk√§ Ridges. These ridges are terminal moraines, which trap networks of thousands of lakes separated by hilly forested countryside. The lake district turns into the Coastal Finland district to the West and Northwest, and is bounded by the Upland Finland to the North. The lake landscape continues to the East and extends into Russia (Karelian Isthmus and Republic of Karelia). Lakes A summer cottage (\\"m√∂kki\\") on a lake island. Lakes occupy about 25% of the Lakeland. Much of the territory is forested and has a low population density. The cities in the region are Lappeenranta, Imatra, Jyv√§skyl√§, Mikkeli, Pieks√§m√§ki, Varkaus, Joensuu, Savonlinna and Kuopio. Since lakes formed the main transport route in earlier times, urban areas are often located on lakeshore, occasionally even on isthmuses or peninsulas, e.g. Varkaus, Savonlinna and Kuopio. The lakes often have extremely convoluted coastlines and consists of several nearly separate stretches of open water (selk√§) connected by narrow sounds. Thus, they can connect large areas along shores and their hinterlands. Because no set definition of what constitutes a lake and no procedures for counting the number of lakes exist, it has been impossible to ascertain exactly how many lakes the region has. There are, however, at least 55,000 lakes that are at least 200 metres wide. If lake is defined to be a body of standing water larger than 500 square metres, then there are 187,888 lakes in Finland. On average, there are 40 lakes per 100 square kilometres in the district. The lake number density is largest north of the Lake Inari, up to 1,000 per 100 square kilometres, so that the area is sometimes called Lampi-Suomi (Pond Finland, Finnish pond district). Hietasaari, Lake Saimaa The largest is Lake Saimaa, which, with a surface area of more than 4,400 square kilometres, is the fourth largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. Lake Saimaa itself contains 5,484 islands, and islands in the greater Saimaa region () number up to 13,710. The deepest lake, P√§ij√§nne, has a maximum depth of only 95.3 metres; the depth of the average lake is 7 metres. Because they are shallow, these many lakes contain only slightly more water than Finland's annual rainfall. The Saimaa Canal connects the Lake Saimaa to the Vyborg Bay of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Another connection to the Baltic Sea is the Vuoksi River, which flows from Saimaa to Lake Ladoga, from where the water subsequently flows through Neva River into the Gulf of Finland, bypassing the Salpausselk√§. Lake P√§ij√§nne is the second largest lake in Finland, which drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Kymi River and which is used as a drinking water supply for Helsinki.

Initially published in 1996 as an extension of SQL-92 (ISO/IEC 9075-4:1996, a version sometimes called PSM-96 or even SQL-92/PSM), SQL/PSM was later incorporated into the multi-part SQL:1999 standard, and has been part 4 of that standard since then, most recently in SQL:2016. The SQL:1999 part 4 covered less than the original PSM-96 because the SQL statements for defining, managing, and invoking routines were actually incorporated into part 2 SQL/Foundation, leaving only the procedural language itself as SQL/PSM. The SQL/PSM facilities are still optional as far as the SQL standard is concerned; most of them are grouped in Features P001-P008. SQL/PSM standardizes syntax and semantics for control flow, exception handling (called \\"condition handling\\" in SQL/PSM), local variables, assignment of expressions to variables and parameters, and (procedural) use of cursors. It also defines an information schema (metadata) for stored procedures. SQL/PSM is one language in which methods for the SQL:1999 structured types can be defined. The other is Java, via SQL/JRT. SQL/PSM is derived, seemingly directly, from Oracle's PL/SQL. Oracle developed PL/SQL and released it in 1991, basing the language on the US Department of Defense's Ada programming language. However, Oracle has maintained a distance from the standard in its documentation. IBM's SQL PL (used in DB2) and Mimer SQL's PSMhttps://developer.mimer.com/documentation/sql/stored-procedures-in-mimer- sql/ were the first two products officially implementing SQL/PSM. It is commonly thought that these two languages, and perhaps also MySQL/MariaDB's procedural language, are closest to the SQL/PSM standard. However, a PostgreSQL addon implements SQL/PSM... (alongside its other procedural languages like the PL/SQL-derived plpgsql), although it is not part of the core product.. RDF functionality in OpenLink Virtuoso was developed entirely through SQL/PSM, combined with custom datatypes (e.g., \`ANY\` for handling URI and Literal relation objects), sophisticated indexing, and flexible physical storage choices (column-wise or row-wise).

Alcaraz-Cuellar initially began playing soccer with the San Diego Flash in 2001. In his rookie season in professional soccer, he began to showcase his talents as an attacking midfielder where he enjoyed a rather successful campaign by tallying in six goals. Unfortunately San Diego would fold the following season, which would result in Alcaraz-Cuellar to sign with the Portland Timbers. It was in Portland where he broaden his position of an attacking midfielder to that of a playmaker. During his tenure with Portland, he established himself as the Timbers' all-time leader in assists, with 44. Including being ranked second in games played, and as well as third in points for the club. He assisted the club by claiming their first USL First Division Commissioner's Cup; he was awarded the Assist Leader Statistical award twice in his career, becoming the first player in league history to win the honor twice consecutively. After failing to negotiate a deal with Portland, Alcaraz- Cuellar subsequently signed a contract with Cascadian arch-rivals Seattle Sounders in 2007. In Seattle he managed to contribute with two goals and eight assists, which tied him for second in the league in assists. Another notable achievement in Seattle was winning the double, in which he claimed his first USL First Division Championship. In February, 2010 he was ranked 15th in the USL First Division Top 25 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade. Early life Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Alcaraz-Cueller's family moved to Santa Barbara, California when he was three years old. Playing career In 2001, Alcaraz- Cuellar went to an open tryout with the San Diego Flash of the USL A-League. The team was impressed enough to offer him a contract and he spent the 2001 season in San Diego. In San Diego, Alcaraz-Culler quickly established himself as a starter that provided him with a productive debut season where he recorded six goals and tallied 3 assists. The Flash folded at the end of the season and he moved to the Portland Timbers in 2002. Under the management of Bobby Howe, he was deployed as a playmaker for the Timbers. His first prosperous season came in 2003, where he helped the Timbers record the club‚Äôs third straight winning season including an impressive four-game winning streak. He set the single-season record for assists at nine. In the 2004 season, Alcaraz-Cuellar contributed by leading the offense with 10 assists that culminated with the Timbers finishing first in the Western Conference, with a record total of 57 points that claimed the league‚Äôs Regular Season Championship. However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by their long-standing rival, the Seattle Sounders. Once the season reached to a conclusion, he was awarded the Assist Leader Statistical award and received All-League honors. In 2005, the Timbers continued their winning ways and finished the year with their fifth straight winning season. Alcaraz-Cuellar managed to re-set the club‚Äôs record for assists in a single season, recording 12 assists which placed him to first in the league in assists for the second straight season, becoming the first player in league history to win the honor twice. . He also earned a second All-League selection. His contract expired in 2007 and when the Timbers did not express an interest in signing him, which resulted in Alcaraz-Cueller to sign a contract with Cascadian rivals the Seattle Sounders after Adrian Hanauer, owner of the Sounders, and Brian Schmetzer, drove to Portland to ask him to sign with Seattle. He selected the number 77 because the number 7 jersey was worn by Leighton O'Brien.10 Questions with Hugo Alcaraz-Cueller In his debut season with the Sounders, he managed to contribute two goals and eight assists, which tied him for second in the league.

Early life Brown was born on December 1, 1831 in New York City. After theological studies at the General Theological Seminary, New York, he was ordained to the diaconate in Trinity Church, New York on April 2, 1854 by Bishop Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright. The following year he was ordained to the priesthood in the Church of The Holy Communion, New York, on the December 1, 1855 by Bishop Horatio Potter.

Brown lived up to the challenge of serving a diocese that had been carved out of the wilderness. According to a History of the Diocese \\"The Council addresses of Bishop Brown, read in the light of later years, are wonderful examples of the conceptions he had of his high office.

The shots were recorded; 21, 14 and 13 for a total of 48 by the Senators, and 25, 18, and 25 for a total of 68 by Edmonton. Several players could not play the whole game, including Eddie Gerard and Georges Boucher. Lionel Hitchman played the game with his broken nose in a plaster. Harry Helman played despite a cut to his face from Frank Nighbor's skates, incurred in practice. Cy Denneny had been cut in the leg by the skate of Vancouver's Smokey Harris. 'Super-sub' King Clancy took a turn in all positions, including goal for Clint Benedict in the third period for two minutes when Benedict was serving a penalty. At the time goalies had to serve their own penalties. This is only time that a player played all six positions in a Stanley Cup Final game. Stanley Cup engraving The 1923 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Senators never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season. It was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \\"1923 Ottawa Senators\\" was put onto its then-new collar.

It is one of the smallest DOs in Spain as the vineyards have been encroached upon by urban development. At the present time it only covers one third of the area that it covered in 1956 when it was established,http://www.gencat.cat/diari/4585/06045138.htm (in Catalan) despite a territorial extension in 1989. History Wines have been produced in this area since the time of the ancient Romans, and were mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia and by Martial in his Epigrams, when they were known as vins laietans. Structures have been found at the archaeological site of Veral de Vallmora, near Tei√†, showing that wine was made there from the 1st to 4th centuries AD. During the Middle Ages Alella wine was served at the court of the Kings of Arag√≥n. The region suffered the effects of the phylloxera virus at the end of the 19th century but the vineyards were successfully replanted using phylloxera resistant rootstock from the New World. In 1906 the wine cooperative, Alella Vin√≠cola, was founded which is renowned for its traditional Marfil brand. The wine cellars were designed by the modernist architect Jeroni Martorell i Terrats. During the 1920s the region was famous for its cava (sparkling wine). During the 1980s new varieties were introduced and the wine-making methods modernized. The wineries are urban mansions that are built on the slopes overlooking the sea. The height above sea level of the vineyards determines the variety grown and thus the type of wine produced. Geography The vineyards grow on the Serra de Parpers foothills, from the coast up the slopes of the mountains. The Bes√≤s river forms the western boundary. There are two distinct areas within the DO: * Maresme, on the foothills overlooking the sea, is influenced by the sun and the Mediterranean breezes. The hills protect the vines from the cold winds and condense the humidity caused by the sea. The wines from this area are smooth with low acidity levels. * Vall√®s, on the interior slopes facing inland, has a more continental climate. The wines are stronger and more acidic. The DO covers the following municipalities: Maresme: Alella, Argentona, Cabrils, El Masnou, Montgat, √írrius, Premi√† de Dalt, Premi√† de Mar, Tei√†, Tiana, Vilassar de Dalt Vall√®s: La Roca del Vall√®s, Martorelles, Montorn√®s del Vall√®s, Santa Maria de Martorelles, Sant Fost de Campsentelles, Vallromanes, Vilanova del Vall√®s Climate The oldest vineyards, close to the coast at an altitude of between 60 ‚Äì 90 m above sea level enjoy a totally Mediterranean climate (mild winters, hot summers), whereas the younger ones, located higher up in cooler areas have a more continental climate. The average temperature is about 15¬∞C (max 35¬∞C in summer, min -3¬∞C in winter) and there is a risk of frost during the winter and spring months especially at the higher altitudes. Rainfall is sparse to average falling mainly at the end of summer and autumn in the form of violent storms. Average of 600 mm per year. Soils The lowest vineyards, at 60 m above sea level, are on dark soils over igneous rocks in an open valley overlooking the sea. The highest ones, in a new district known as Vall√©s, are on lime bearing rock sheltered by the mountains. The most interesting feature of Allella DO is the distinctive topsoil which is known as saul√≥ in Catalan. It is basically a white granite-based sand which is very porous and retains heat very well. This helps the grapes to ripen, while the low water retention properties are compensated by the local humid microclimate. Grape varieties White: * Recommended: Garnacha blanca and Xarel¬∑lo (Pansa blanca) * Also authorized: Chardonnay, Chenin, Macabeo, Malvasia, Moscatell de Gra Petit, Parellada, Picapoll Blanc, and Sauvignon blanc Red: * Recommended: Garnacha Negra * Also authorized: Cabernet sauvignon, Garnatxa Peluda, Merlot, Monastrell (Morastrell), Pinot noir, Sams√≥, Mazuela, Sumoll negre, Syrah and Ull de llebre (Tempranillo) The older vines grow freely while the newer vineyards have been planted on trellises. Planting density is between 2,000 and 3,500 vines per hectare.

In 1996 Karpienka was leading the initiative to impeach President Lukashenka, although this initiative lacked significant support. In 1998 Karpienka was head of the National Executive Committee, an oppositional shadow government. He was considered as the leader of the Belarusian opposition and as the most probable oppositional candidate for the upcoming presidential elections. Unclear circumstances of death On March 31, 1999 Karpienka was taken to the 9th Minsk city hospital with an apparent cerebral hemorrhage. On April 1 he was operated on, but did not regain consciousness. He died on April 6 at seven in the morning. The death of Hienadz Karpienka was very unexpected, there was no history of such health problems. A month after Karipenka's death, Jury Zacharanka, one of his closest friends and colleagues, was abducted. Within 6 months the same happened to Karpienka's second close colleague Viktar Hanchar.

ATX Power Good The ATX specification defines the Power-Good signal as a +5-volt (V) signal generated in the power supply when it has passed its internal self- tests and the outputs have stabilized. This normally takes between 0.1 and 0.5 seconds after the power supply is switched on. The signal is then sent to the motherboard, where it is received by the processor timer chip that controls the reset line to the processor. The ATX specification requires that the power-good signal (\\"PWR_OK\\") go high no sooner than after the power rails have stabilized, and remain high for after loss of AC power, and fall (to less than ) at least before the power rails fall out of specification (to 95% of their nominal value). Cheaper and/or lower quality power supplies do not follow the ATX specification of a separate monitoring circuit; they instead wire the power good output to one of the lines. This means the processor will never reset given bad power unless the line drops low enough to turn off the trigger, which could be too low for proper operation. Power Good values Power good value is based on the delay in ms, that a power supply takes to become fully ready. Power good values are often considered abnormal if detected lower than 100 ms or higher than 500 ms.Manufacturer of a power supply tester References External links * (broken link) Power Good article on pcguide * (broken link) ATX12V power supply design guide 2.01 * ATX12V power supply design guide 2.01 * Desktop Platform Form Factors Power Supply Category:Computer jargon Category:Power supplies ","title":"Power good signal"},{"id":"11665290","text":"Lake Tawakoni is a reservoir located in Northeast Texas, approximately east of Dallas, Texas.

Etymology The lake was named for the Tawakoni Native American peoples, who were a larger part of the Caddo Nation. The Caddos inhabited a large swath of North and East Texas, including where the lake is located. History The reservoir was constructed in 1960 with the Iron Bridge Dam. The area was chosen due to its location to the growing Dallas area and the growth east of the city and its respective suburbs. The South Fork, Cowleech Fork, and Caddo Forks that all formed the Sabine River headwaters are now submerged under the lake and the lake now serves as the headwaters of the Sabine. It covers and has a storage capacity of at conservation pool level. It is owned by the Sabine River Authority of Texas. Flora and fauna The lake has a diverse array of wildlife. It features deer, feral hogs, snakes, raccoons, bobcats, and over 200 species of birds. Sightings of the American alligator in certain areas of the lake have not been uncommon. The lake mainly has post oak hardwood timber and plants native to the Texas Blackland Prairies. In the summer of 2007, Lake Tawakoni State Park was the site of a large, rare spider web.

After the match, Kennedy reflected the 2007‚Äì08 season, stating that the club have had an 'amazing' season and described this an unbelievable feeling. However, Rochdale would succumb 3‚Äì2 to Stockport County, remaining in League Two for the following season. Despite this, he went on to finish his first season, making 46 appearances (43 in the league) and scoring two times in all competitions. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Kennedy started the season well when he helped the side go to their winning ways following the play‚Äìoffs defeat to Stockport County and scored a winning goal from a free kick in stoppage time, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Chesterfield on 20 September 2008. It wasn't until on 23 January 2009 when he scored his second goal of the season, in a 3‚Äì2 loss against Dagenham & Redbridge. A week later, Kennedy signed a contract extension, keeping him until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Following this, he scored two more goals later in the season against Macclesfield Town and Brentford. Since the start of the season, Kennedy featured in every league game until he missed out on the last game of the season, due to resting ahead of the play‚Äìoffs. However, once again, Rochdale lost 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to Gillingham. Despite this, Kennedy was voted into the PFA League Two Team of The Year, voted for by his fellow professionals in League Two, for the 2008‚Äì09 season at the PFA awards. He was also voted Defender of the Year for the 2008‚Äì09 season following Rochdale's unsuccessful promotion push.

He later scored two more goals by the end of the 2009 against Bury and Barnet. His performance throughout the 2009‚Äì10 season led Manager Keith Hill commented in March 2010 that Kennedy is considered as the best left-back in League Two. After helping the club finished third place that saw them promoted to League One, Kennedy finished the 2009‚Äì10 season, making 47 (44 in the league) appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. Once again, Kennedy was voted into the PFA League Two Team of The Year for the 2009‚Äì10 season at the PFA awards. At the end of the season, Kennedy was offered a new contract by the club, as his contract set to expires in July. However, he announced his intention to leave Rochdale, with clubs in Championship like Doncaster Rovers, Leeds United, Scunthorpe United all tracking to sign Kennedy.

It wasn't until on 28 September 2010 when he made his league debut for the club away, in a 4‚Äì3 loss against Norwich City, playing the whole game. During the match, he was conceded a penalty when he was penalised for handball. After the match, Kennedy acknowledged the fault of giving away the penalty, but hopes for first team football in the near future. Despite stating that he adapted to the team, his time at Leicester City was unhappy over lack of first team opportunities at Leicester City as he spent time on the bench more often, as well as, becoming the third choice player in the left‚Äìback position behind Bruno Berner and Greg Cunningham. In his first season at Leicester City, Kennedy went on to make four appearances in all competitions. Ahead of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Kennedy stated that he has no future at Leicester City.

It wasn't until on 30 October 2011 when Kennedy made his second debut for the club, playing the whole game, in a 3‚Äì2 loss against Watford. After making ten appearance for the side in his second loan spell, Kennedy's second loan at Peterborough ended in January 2012.

Barker (June 4, 1899 ‚Äì January 13, 1939) was an American criminal, the son of Ma Barker and a member of the Barker-Karpis gang, founded by his brother Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis. Generally known as \\"Doc\\", Barker was typically called on for violent action, while Fred and Karpis planned the gang's crimes. He was arrested and convicted of kidnapping in 1935. Sent to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1936, he was killed three years later while attempting to escape from the Rock. Barker is described by one writer as \\"a dimwit and a drunk\\", who was little more than a brutal thug. However, fellow Alcatraz inmate Henri Young said of him that he was \\"determined and ruthless, and that once he started on anything nothing could stop him but death.\\" Early life Barker was born in Aurora, Missouri, the son of George Elias Barker and Arizona \\"Ma\\" Barker (n√©e Clark). Circa 1910, the family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Barker, with his brothers Herman, Lloyd and Fred, committed numerous crimes such as theft, robbery and murder. On July 18, 1918, Barker was arrested for stealing a car on the highway and was sent to serve prison time in Joplin, Missouri. On February 19, 1920, he escaped from Joplin prison. Using the pseudonym \\"Claude Dade\\", Barker was involved in robberies in Oklahoma. He was arrested and imprisoned at Oklahoma State Penitentiary under the name \\"Bob Barker\\" from January to June 1921. On August 25, 1921, Barker and three other men robbed a woman at a hospital construction site in Tulsa. The three men were surprised by the night watchman, Thomas Sherill. When Sherill saw them he opened fire. Sherill was fatally shot when two of the men shot at him while fleeing the scene. After Sherill's family hired a private investigator, Barker and another man, Volney \\"Curley\\" Davis, who worked at the construction site and was friendly with the Barker family, were arrested for Sherill's murder.Mahoney 2013 p.15 On January 14, 1922, Barker was convicted of Sherill's murder and sentenced to a life term at Oklahoma State Penitentiary. Barker appealed the conviction and always maintained his innocence of this crime. He was paroled ten years later, on September 10, 1932.Helmer, William J. and Mattix, Rick (2007) The Complete Public Enemies Almanac Cumberland HouseMichael Koch (2008) A Murder in Tulsa Publish America Reunion with the Barker Gang After his release, Barker joined up with his brother Fred and Karpis. By this time, Barker was described as a morose, heavy drinking man and a \\"stone eyed\\" killer. According to one woman associated with the Barker‚ÄìKarpis gang, Barker had little interest in female company and was awkward around women, something she attributed to his institutionalized life in prison. On December 16, 1932, Barker participated in the robbery of the Third Northwestern Bank in Minneapolis. Two policemen were killed in that robbery and a civilian was murdered by Barker's brother Fred during the getaway. On August 30, 1933, the Barker‚ÄìKarpis gang robbed a payroll at Stockyards National Bank of South St. Paul. Barker fatally shot policeman Leo Pavlak after he had already surrendered. Barker also helped the gang kidnap two wealthy St. Paul, Minnesota men: William Hamm in June 1933 and Edward Bremer in January 1934. Barker personally grabbed both Hamm and Bremer, intimidating them with his brutality.Mahoney 2013 pp. 78, 114 However, it was Barker who made a slip-up that led to the gang's capture. Having collected the ransom for Bremer, Barker was driving the captive to a drop-off point. Along the way he stopped to refuel from a gas can, and removed a glove while doing so. The discarded can was recovered and Barker's fingerprint was identified.Mahoney 2013 p.126 Arrest Unaware that police had identified them in Hamm and Bremer's kidnapping, the Barker‚ÄìKarpis gang attempted to launder the money they had extorted, convinced (correctly) that the FBI had recorded the serial numbers. They briefly relocated to Cuba, then moved to Florida, where they rented a house near Lake Weir. Barker devised a plan for a new robbery, but other members of the gang rejected the idea, believing that they should keep a low profile. Bored, Barker left for Chicago. While in Chicago, Barker met Byron Bolton, a former associate of Fred Goetz. On January 8, 1935, Barker was identified and was arrested in the street by FBI agents. When asked \\"Where's your gun?\\"; Barker replied, \\"Home‚Äîand ain't that a hell of a place for it?\\".Alex Tresniowski, The Vendett: Special Agent Melvin Purvis, John Dillinger, and Hoover's FBI in the Age of Gangsters, 2010, p.444. He was interviewed by Melvin Purvis, who later wrote, \\"he sat in a chair, jaw clenched, looking straight ahead. He was not impressive-looking. Only his eyes told the story of an innate savagery\\". Bolton was also taken into custody. While Barker refused to speak, Bolton revealed that the other members of the gang were in Florida. A map found in Barker's room provided more detail. Shortly afterwards, Fred and Ma Barker were located and killed in a shootout with FBI agents. Barker was charged with the kidnapping of Bremer. He attempted to intimidate Bremer to stop his testimony, telling him, \\"I have plenty of contacts out there who would get you\\".Mahoney, p.171 Nevertheless, Barker was convicted of the kidnapping and sentenced to life in prison.FBI Barker-Karpis summary Imprisonment and death Barker's prison file with mugshot. Along with Alvin Karpis, Arthur Barker was sent to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary to serve his life term. On January 13, 1939, Barker and fellow inmates Dale Stamphill, Henri Young, William \\"Ty\\" Martin and Rufus McCain attempted to escape. Henri Young later said of Barker, \\"he was one of America's most dangerous men. I knew, however, that he was determined and ruthless, and that once he started on anything nothing could stop him but death. I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather have with me on a break from Alcatraz.\\" The four men had been placed in the segregation unit for troublesome prisoners. Barker and his associates sawed through four sets of prison bars, concealing the daily damage with makeshift putty. When they finally broke through, they climbed over the high walls of the prison under cover of a foggy night and made their way to the beach. The four then split up into two pairs. Barker and Stamphill tried to swim out together towards San Francisco, but were pushed back by the tide. They then tried to quickly build a raft from bits of wood lying around the beach, tying them together with strips of cloth from their shirts. They hoped to make a serviceable raft before they were spotted, but were seen from a guard's tower when the fog briefly cleared. The guard ordered them to \\"throw your hands in the air\\", but they ignored him. Stamphill later said they didn't hear any warnings. The guard opened fire, hitting them in the legs. Another burst of fire from a patrol boat wounded Barker in the head. He told Stamphill, \\"Don't move. They are going to kill us\\".Ward, Davis, Alcatraz: The Gangster Years, University of California Press, 2009, pp.169; 487. Barker was recaptured, dying shortly afterwards from his wounds.William B. Breuer, J. Edgar Hoover and His G-Men, Praeger, 1995, p.235. Stamphill, Young and McCain were also recaptured and sent to solitary confinement. Stamphill later claimed the associate warden gave instructions that if Doc moved at all the guards were to shoot him in the head. Doc was in considerable pain and reached for his wounded leg and was then shot. Once in the infirmary, the doctors attempted to give him a blood transfusion. He yanked the tubes out of his arm.

The island at one point had three farms on the island in the mid- nineteenth century, and parts of the island were cleared of trees in order to fit the farms as well as space for cattle to graze. Two of the three farms didn't last see the end of the century. The island was one of the last undeveloped coastal properties on Cape Cod. Washburn Island is bordered by the Seapit River and Eel Pond. Various coastal storms caused the island to reconnect and separate from the mainland on and off, but it as of now it is a true island. Artifacts dating back 450‚Äì1000 years, including hammer flakes and shell middens, have been found on the island.http://www.waquoitbayreserve.org/components.asp In 1983, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the island in order to make it a state park of the state park system.

It was added to the confederation in the 15th century. Margate and the sea Memorial to the coxswain and crew of the Friend to all Nations, Nayland Rocks, Margate Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250 years. Like its neighbours Ramsgate and Broadstairs it has been a traditional holiday destination for Londoners drawn to its sandy beaches. Edward Hasted, writing in the 18th century, described Margate as a \\"poor fishing town\\", but in 1810, when describing the shore, he wrote: \\"... [it] was so well adapted to bathing, being an entire level and covered with the finest sand, which extends for several miles on either side of the harbour... [near which] there are several commodious bathing rooms, out of which the bathers are driven in the machines, any depth along the sands into the sea; at the back of the machine is a door, through which the bathers descend a few steps into the water, and an umbrella of canvas dropping over conceals them from the public view. Upwards of 40 of these machines are frequently employed...\\" The town's history is tied closely to the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. The record of the vessel, Friend to all Nations, and the Margate Surfboat disaster of 1897 are noteworthy events in Margate's past. Steamboats About 1816 The Times reported that the introduction of steamboats had given the whole coast of Kent (and) the Isle of Thanet in particular, \\"a prodigious lift\\". However, Sir Rowland Hill (creator of the 1840 Penny Post), while in Thanet during 1815, remarked: \\"It is surprising to see how most people are prejudiced against this packet.\\" So popular were the steam boat excursions that in 1841 there were six different companies competing for the Margate passenger traffic. Even with the advent of the railway in 1846 the steamboats continued in service until their final withdrawal in 1967. In 1820 it was said that \\"the inhabitants of Margate ought to eulogise the name of Watt, as the founder of their good fortune; and steam vessels as the harbingers of their prosperity\\". Railways The railway came to Margate via two separate companies. The South Eastern Railway (SER) was the first to reach the town when its branch line from the main line at Ashford, having opened to Ramsgate on 13 April 1846, was continued to a station called Margate Sands on 1 December the same year. It was not direct, however: trains had to reverse from the terminus at Ramsgate to reach Margate. In spite of that, crowds of people added to the already high numbers coming by sea. The SER had the rail monopoly until 5 October 1863, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway completed its North Kent coast line and opened a station at Margate West. Once the Southern Railway had been formed, in 1923, there was a major rationalisation of the Isle of Thanet railways: the old route from Ramsgate was closed completely and a new railway connection, looping round the Isle of Thanet, meant that trains could pass through the town from either direction. Margate West (renamed simply Margate) Station became the only railway station in the town. The Railway is now run by Southeastern Trains, which is connected to the Govia group which also runs the South Central lines. Royal School for Deaf Children England's first public institution for deaf children known as 'London Asylum for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor' was started in London in 1792. The School opened its branch in Margate (August 1876) and later on, moved the entire operation from London to Margate. The School's Westgate College for Deaf People, for students aged 16 and over, closed on 11 December 2015. An inspection the previous month by the Care Quality Commission uncovered what the inspectors called \\"shocking examples of institutionalised failings and abuse\\" and the trust running the schools subsequently went into administration. Burning debris from destroyed Margate Jetty 1978 Margate Jetty Margate Jetty, also known as Margate Pier, which was designed by Eugenius Birch in 1856, has suffered damage from the sea over the years. On 1 January 1877 it was sliced through by a storm-driven wreck that marooned 40 to 50 people. They were not rescued until the next day. The pier survived until 11‚Äì12 January 1978, when it was hit by another storm. The storm washed up the planks from the pier onto Margate Beach. The wreck of the pier remained for several years, surviving several attempts to blow it up, before final demolition. Margate Jetty is now categorised as a lost pier. Wherries Between 1890 and 1939 about 30 pleasure boats operated from Margate beach. The main builder of these Thanet wherries was Brockman's of Margate, which turned them out in large numbers before World War I. It developed two distinct types of boats: the wherry proper, with high sides, and the wherry punt, with low sides. The hulls were traditionally varnished, a practice employed by boatmen from Thanet to Devon. Some boatmen put a wider beam into the design to assist fishing. Although employing a clinker-built hull, the shape was similar to the Deal galley and the Thames waterman's skiff. The last wherry in service at Margate was operated by a Dusty Miller of Westgate-on-Sea (a suburb of Margate), and built by an apprentice at Brockman's of Margate in 1939. \\"She was only about 12 ft long and being small was sometimes called a skiff.\\"  Margate during the Second World War  On 3 September 1940, at 0950 hours pilot officer Richard Hillary was shot down during combat against three Messerschmitts. He landed in the sea near the North Foreland, and was rescued by the Margate lifeboat. His Spitfire (RAF serial number X4277) had burst into flames and he was badly burned. Hillary, the grandson of the founder of the lifeboat service Sir William Hillary, recovered from his ordeal and later wrote the book The Last Enemy. He was killed in a training flight accident in 1943, aged 24. Howard Primrose Knight, coxswain of the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential, and Edward Duke Parker, (nearly always incorrectly stated as Edward DRAKE Parker), coxswain of the Margate lifeboat Lord Southborough (ON 688), were both awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in recognition of their gallantry and determination when ferrying troops from the beaches of Dunkirk during the evacuation of 1940. Margate Coxswain shown as Edward Drake Palmer. The lifeboats had assisted in retrieving at least 2,800 men, by towing eight wherries, during a continuous service lasting 40 hours. Following this achievement the Margate boat returned to Dunkirk to rescue 500‚Äì600 French soldiers from the beach. In a letter to the RNLI, the Commander of HMS Icarus stated: \\"The manner in which the Margate lifeboat crew brought off load after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire, will be an inspiration to us all as long as we live.\\"  Storm of 1949  The storm of early March 1949 caused widespread damage in Margate and along the North Kent Coast. Kent Fire Brigade estimated that it took 1,550 man hours to fight the floods which had devastated Kent in the previous two weeks. The high tide caused flooding at various points between Margate and Crayford. The tidal surge swept down the North Sea, into the Thames Estuary and up the river valleys, reaching inland. So bad was the flooding that Chatham, Rochester, Strood, Upnor, Gravesend, Sheerness, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Herne Bay, Whitstable, Dover and Margate were declared one incident.BBC Kent Weather Dreamland and the Scenic Railway Scenic Railway, 1930s The disused Scenic Railway in December 2007 Dreamland amusement park was established in the 1920s and is home to the oldest roller coaster in the UK, namely the wooden Scenic Railway.

It was known to be working in 1889. ;Hooper's Mill Hooper's Mill A horizontal windmill built by Stephen Hooper at the end of the eighteenth century. Its location was between Dane Hill and Margate Caves. The date of erection is not known, but it would seem to have been in existence by March 1791, when there was an advert in the Kentish Gazette in relation to the patent vanes used in the mill. The mill was demolished circa 1828. An illustration of the mill in Rees's Cyclop√¶dia shows that the windmill had forty vertical sail blades mounted on the vertical Windshaft-cum-Upright Shaft. It drove three pairs of overdrift millstones. One pair was driven directly from the Great Spur Wheel, and another two pairs were driven by a further Spur Wheel on an Upright Shaft driven by the Great Spur Wheel. ;Nayland Mill This mill was marked on the 1801 OS map. It was moved to the position later occupied by Draper's Mill, thus would have been demolished in the 1840s. ;Draper's Mill Built in 1845 by John Holman, this smock mill was working by wind until 1916 and by engine until the late 1930s. It was saved from demolition and is now restored and open to the public. ;Little Draper's Mill This smock mill was moved from a site near Barham railway station in 1869. It was demolished in 1929, leaving just the base which itself was demolished in 1954. ;Pumping Mill This brick tower mill was first marked on the 1858-72 Ordnance Survey (OS) map.The 1\\" to 1 mile Ordnance Survey map covering this area, which was published at a date between 1858 and 1872 It was built with five sails, but after being tailwinded in 1878 it was rebuilt with four sails. The mill was tailwinded again in August 1894. Repairs were estimated to cost ¬£275 but were not carried out. The tower stood capless for a few years after and was demolished early in the twentieth century.

This slip can be generated either by the tire's rotational speed being greater or less than the free-rolling speed (usually described as percent slip), or by the tire's plane of rotation being at an angle to its direction of motion (referred to as slip angle). In rail vehicle dynamics, this overall slip of the wheel relative to the rail is called creepage. It is distinguished from the local sliding velocity of surface particles of wheel and rail, which is called micro-slip. Longitudinal slip The longitudinal slip is generally given as a percentage of the difference between the surface speed of the wheel compared to the speed between axle and road surface, as: : \\\\text{slip}=-\\\\frac{v_x - r_e\\\\Omega }{v_x} where \\\\Omega is the lateral component of the rotational speed of the wheel, r is wheel radius at the point of contact and v_x is vehicle speed in the plane of the tire. A positive slip indicates that the wheels are spinning; negative slip indicates that they are skidding. Locked brakes, r_e \\\\Omega = 0, means that \\\\text{slip} = -1 = -100\\\\% and sliding without rotating. Rotation with no velocity, r_e \\\\Omega e 0 and v = 0, means that \\\\text{slip} = \\\\infty. Lateral slip The lateral slip of a tire is the angle between the direction it is moving and the direction it is pointing. This can occur, for instance, in cornering, and is enabled by deformation in the tire carcass and tread. Despite the name, no actual sliding is necessary for small slip angles.

For men, hCG can have some potential side-effects, including gynecomastia, water retention, increase in sex drive, mood alterations, headaches, and high blood pressure. In Phase 3, use of hCG stops, but food continues to be 100% organic. Other recommended activities include walking an hour a day or more, eating organic grapefruit, and doing breathing exercises. Scheduled doctor visits, buying organic foods and hCG can be very expensive for the average consumer, but wealthy people have paid to follow the plan, and the plan might work for people who can afford it.

The film centers on a news reporter and her cameraman covering a firefighter intervention at an apartment building in Barcelona. As the situation escalates, and after some of the building's occupants are infected by an evil virus and begin to show animalistic and murderous behavior, the reporter and cameraman find themselves confined inside the perilous building. The film was a commercial and critical success. It is now recognized as one of the early successes, and one of the best films in the found footage genre. Rec placed at number 60 on Time Outs list of the top 100 best horror films. The film spawned the Rec film series, and was followed by three sequels: Rec 2 directed by Balaguer√≥ and Plaza in 2009, Rec 3: Genesis directed by Plaza in 2012, and Rec 4: Apocalypse directed by Balaguer√≥ in 2014 as the final installment in the franchise. The film was remade in the United States under the name Quarantine in 2008.  Plot  Reporter √Ångela Vidal and her cameraman Pablo are covering the night shift in one of Barcelona's local fire stations for the documentary television series While You're Sleeping. While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. √Ångela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, √Ålex and Manu, to the apartment building, where two police officers are waiting. As they approach, the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck. As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside. As people begin to panic, √Ålex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and critically injured. Mrs. Izquierdo then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. √Ångela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents. One of the interviewees is a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Mari Carmen claims she has tonsillitis, and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well. A health inspector in a hazmat suit arrives and attempts to treat the injured until they suddenly become preternaturally aggressive. After the injured are locked in the building's textile warehouse, the health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to rabies, and that the disease was traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and √Ångela realizes it must be Max. When the residents confront Mari Carmen, Jennifer turns, vomits blood at her mother's face and flees upstairs. Sergio handcuffs Mari Carmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Gradually, the rest of the apartment's residents are bitten and infected. √Ångela, Pablo and Manu, the three survivors, find a key that will allow them to escape from the building via a large drain in the basement that is connected to the sewers. Manu is bitten outside the apartment of the key's location, forcing √Ångela and Pablo to take refuge in the penthouse. They discover a tape recorder which explains that the penthouse owner, an agent of the Vatican, was charged with the task of isolating an enzyme carried by a young Portuguese girl named Tristana Medeiros, whose symptoms suggest a demonic possession. As the agent attempted to treat Medeiros, the enzyme mutated and became contagious. The agent then sealed Tristana in the house to die of starvation. An infected boy within the attic damages the light on Pablo's camera, requiring Pablo to activate the camera's night vision. A now-ghoulish Tristana emerges and searches the penthouse for food. √Ångela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. √Ångela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as √Ångela is dragged into the darkness screaming.

Release  The film premiered in August 2007 at the 64th Venice International Film Festival, out of competition, in the opening and closing films sessions. It was also shown in October 2007 at the Sitges Film Festival and the M√°laga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in November 2007, before going on general release in Spain later that month. The film was also shown in February 2008 at the Glasgow Film Festival and the co-directors participated in a corresponding interview in which they revealed their influences during the creation of the cinema work: \\"Our main reference was TV; was not other films, or a tradition of previous features. I think the main influence for us was TV. What we wanted was to build a classic horror story, but, ahh, telling it in the way of a TV show.\\" REC was then released in the United Kingdom in April 2008 and a North American DVD release occurred in 2009.  Reception  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.52/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Plunging viewers into the nightmarish hellscape of an apartment complex under siege, [Rec] proves that found footage can still be used as an effective delivery mechanism for sparse, economic horror.\\" Reviewing the film for the BBC, Jamie Russell called it \\"A runaway rollercoaster of a fright flick\\", praising the \\"faux-docu handheld style\\", and the sense of claustrophobia and confusion, claiming that \\"[Rec] will definitely jangle the nerves\\"; however, Russell criticised the lack of substance and a \\"one- dimensional\\" supporting cast. Bloody Disgusting awarded the film four-and-a- half stars out of five, with the reviewer writing, \\"[REC] has it all and is probably one of the best Spanish horror films in recent memory.\\" Bloody Disgusting later ranked the film eleventh in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article stating: \\"Out of all the 'shaky-cam' films... this one is arguably the best.\\" In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Rec placed at number 54 on their top 100 list.

The beach is a narrow spit of land, which forms a natural barrier between the fresh water delta of the Dalyan river and the Mediterranean. It is one of the main breeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean and is therefore often referred to as Turtle Beach. The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is on the IUCN Red list of endangered animals. For this reason the beach has had a protected status since 1988 and is part of the K√∂yceƒüiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area. The greatest threat to the survival of the loggerhead sea turtle is on these sandy beaches where its life begins. This has triggered an international conservation effort that began in the 1990s. The effort to protect loggerhead sea turtle eggs and to assure a safe breeding ground for this endangered species has made international headlines. This issue is one of the most critical items on Turkey's environmental agenda.  History  From 1984 onwards there had been rumours about developing the beach for mass tourism. Plans were discussed for building a hotel and a marina at the delta side and bungalows at K√º√ß√ºk Dalyan at the banks of S√ºl√ºng√ºr lake. In 1986 the owners of the beach huts were summoned to clear and dismantle their huts by October that year. In April 1987 the rumours about a hotel complex came true, when building started on the Kaunos Beach Hotel, an 1800-bed holiday resort to be financed with German development aid funds. Since this would have meant the end of an important nesting habitat for the loggerhead turtle, June Haimoff, together with fellow-environmentalists such as David Bellamy, Lily Venizelos, G√ºnther Peter, Nergis Yazgan and Keith Corbett, launched a campaign to save the beach. This started a grim international struggle between conservationists and developers. There were protests from -amongst others- the IUCN, Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund and the Zoologische Gesellschaft Frankfurt. Especially in the Federal Republic of Germany the building project caused great indignation, because German DEG (Deutsche Finanzierungsgesellschaft f√ºr Beteiligungen in Entwicklungsl√§ndern) wanted to claim a fund of 5 million euros worth from public means under the pretense of \\"development aid\\".Die Amphibien und Reptilien der S√ºdwest-T√ºrkei, M.Franzen, M. Bu√ümann, Th. Kordges, B. Thiesmeier, 2008, June Haimoff approached the WWF, upon which Prince Philip -then president- asked the Turkish Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal for a moratorium, while awaiting an Environmental impact assessment. This request was granted and building temporarily stopped. In the meantime the German Federal Government decided against the use of funds for the hotel by DEG. In July 1988 the Turkish government decided against development and gave ƒ∞ztuzu beach and its hinterland the Special Environmental Protection Area status. June Haimoff has narrated the struggle to preserve ƒ∞ztuzu beach as a nesting habitat in her autobiographical book Kaptan June and the Turtles, that was first published in 1997.Kaptan June and the Turtles, June Haimoff, 1997, In 2001 a Turkish translation was published called Kaptan June ve Kaplumbaƒüalar.  Protection  Information at ƒ∞ztuzu Beach With an average of some 300 nests per year, ƒ∞ztuzu Beach is one of the prime nesting habitats of the loggerhead turtle in the Mediterranean. To prevent disturbance and disruption of the turtles and their nests, strict regulations have been imposed by the government since 1988: * From 1 May - 31 October the beach is inaccessible to the public between 20.00 and 08:00, to counter sound and light disturbance * Vehicles and animals are not allowed to enter the beach * In the marked nesting zones parasols and sunbeds are forbidden. Neither is it allowed to lie down on towels or to dig holes. * Speedboats are banned within a 1-mile zone from the beach and in the Dalyan delta and river. June Haimoff at the release of a rehabilitated loggerhead turtleThese measures have proven to be successful, despite the enormous increase of tourism. The monitoring programme carried out from 1988 onwards, shows a stable population and even a slight increase of nests on the beach. Ever since May 2009 there has been a turtle centre at the beach, run by the Biology Department of Pamukkale University. During the breeding season students and volunteers are involved in monitoring. They locate and count nests and protect them with cages to prevent predation. Injured turtles found on the beach or in the estuary are brought in for treatment and rehabilitation. In February 2011 the Kaptan June Sea Turtle Conservation Foundation was established, a foundation whose mission is to protect sea turtles and their habitat. The former beach hut of conservationist June Haimoff has been brought back to ƒ∞ztuzu and has been transformed into a small museum. Kaptan June Sea Turtle Foundation gets official go-ahead In May 2011 she was rewarded an MBE by Elizabeth II for her services to environmental conservation and the protection of endangered turtles in Turkey. \\"Queen‚Äôs New Years Honours - Turkey - June Haimoff-Fairey awarded MBE for environment work\\", Britse ambassade in Ankara (7 januari 2011)  International appreciation  In the period from 1988 onwards the K√∂yceƒüiz-Dalyan region has become a popular holiday destination. ƒ∞ztuzu Beach is frequented, both by people living or staying in Dalyan and by day tourists from e.g. Marmaris and Sarƒ±germe.

The Act was passed by the Rajiv Gandhi government to nullify the decision in the Shah Bano case. This case caused the Rajiv Gandhi government, with its absolute majority, to pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 which diluted the secular judgement of the Supreme Court. It is administered by any magistrate of the first class exercising jurisdiction under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. As per the Act, a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to reasonable and fair provision and maintenance from her former husband, and this should be paid within the period of iddah. According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of this Act, when a Muslim divorced woman is unable to support herself after the iddah period that she must observe after the death of her spouse or after a divorce, during which she may not marry another man, the magistrate is empowered to make an order for the payment of maintenance by her relatives who would be entitled to inherit her property on her death according to Muslim Law. But when a divorced woman has no such relatives, and does not have enough means to pay the maintenance, the magistrate would order the State Waqf Board to pay the maintenance. The 'liability' of husband to pay the maintenance was thus restricted to the period of the iddah only. Personal laws High Courts have interpreted \\"just and fair provision\\" that a woman is entitled to during her iddat period very broadly to include amounts worth lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of rupees. More recently the Supreme Court in Danial Latifi v. Union of India read the Act with Articles 14 and 15 of the constitution which prevent discrimination on the basis of sex and held that the intention of the framers could not have been to deprive Muslim women of their rights. Further the Supreme Court construed the statutory provision in such a manner that it does not fall foul of Articles 14 and 15. The provision in question is Section 3(1)(a) of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 which states that \\"a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance to be made and paid to her within the iddah period by her former husband\\". The Court held this provision means that reasonable and fair provision and maintenance is not limited for the iddah period (as evidenced by the use of word \\"within\\" and not \\"for\\"). It extends for the entire life of the divorced wife until she remarries. In Shabana Bano v Imran Khan, the Supreme Court held that a Muslim divorced woman who has no means to maintain herself is entitled to get maintenance from her former husband even after the period of iddah and she can claim the same under S.125 CrPC. Divorced women are entitled to maintenance not only for iddat period from their former husband but also to reasonable and fair provisions for future maintenance. S.3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act has to be given under the liberal interpretation to help divorced women. K. Zunaideen v.

The new system designated roads by importance to travel patterns and rectified the previous numbering system under new unified designations.  History  Highway numbers in Louisiana first appeared in 1921, per Act 95 of the 1921 Special Session of the Louisiana Legislature. Routes 1 through 98 were defined that year. These first 98 routes remained consistent throughout the pre-1955 era. The lowest numbered routes seem to have followed major auto trails; for instance, LA 1 was the Jefferson Highway, LA 2 was the Old Spanish Trail, etc. The remainder of the numbering system seemed to work on a lower-number, higher-order principle, with some clustering; for instance, LA 61 and 62 both existed in St. Bernard Parish. When US highways were added in 1926, the US designations were simply overlaid over the preexisting state route (SR) designations in a method similar to modern Georgia (the state route was included in signage as well). Other routes were added as time went on, numbered in consecutive fashion, starting with LA 99 in 1924. By 1926 there were 162 defined routes; by 1929, 490. The number of routes increased precipitously during the Huey Long era, with 1325 routes defined by 1930 and more to come. A few routes were given \\"half\\" numbers, such as LA 99¬Ω and LA 1315¬Ω, for reasons perhaps related to numerical duplications in the official legal descriptions of the routes. (LA 99¬Ω, which had been jokingly referred to as \\"the left lane of 100,\\" was redesignated in the pre-1955 era, as LA 2203.) The pre-1955 system eventually reached the 22xx numeric range (or so) at its zenith. There were also \\"C-xxxx\\" roads, the purpose of which is unclear. All roads were seemingly numbered in the order that they were taken into the system, which led to anarchy, inconsistency, and disorder prevailing among the system of numbered routes. Major through routes were often divided up into several different route designations, and the routing of several primary marked routes (such as the old LA 1 and LA 30) came to make little sense from a traffic flow perspective. Route designations were somewhat sacrosanct; apparently they could only be rerouted to take advantage of minor alignment shifts along the same general route. Former route segments retained the same number with a letter suffix added, starting with \\"D\\" and increasing with other bypassed segments in the same area. For example, bypassed LA 7 west of Hammond (current LA 1040) became LA 7D (or 7-D) while a bypassed segment east of Hammond (current LA 1067) became LA 7E (or 7-E). However, the major routes by and large retained consistent numbers despite the lack of major reroutings. Suffixes were also used in a way similar to the \\"spur\\" routes in the present system. Unlike today's system, clustering of the higher numbers seems to have occurred only when multiple routes in an area were added at the same time. For example, LA 1225 to 1251 all existed within Jefferson Parish and were designated by the same act of legislature in 1930. Otherwise, routes appear to have been numbered sequentially as they were added to the system. Not all numbers were assigned to existing roads; some roads were merely \\"projected\\", which is to say they were only lines on paper. State roads were often improved only \\"if funds were available.\\" This resulted in routes being nonexistent in the field, in whole or in part, or signed along routes that sometimes differed from their legal description. LA 33 was always discontinuous as ten miles of the New Orleans‚ÄìHammond Highway was never completed as planned through St. John the Baptist and St. Charles Parishes. LA 1 did not match its legal description until 1928 when the Jefferson Highway was completed between Shrewsbury and New Orleans.  Renumbering  Post-war efforts to make improvements to Louisiana's unorganized highway-numbering system reached fruition at the 1955 legislative session, where a comprehensive highway bill was passed that year and enacted into law. The new law effected a comprehensive revision of state highway classification and numbering, in order to designate roads by importance to travel patterns and to rectify the confusing numbering system by marking primary travel routes under unified designations. One element of the highway reform lobby's efforts that was left out of the 1955 highway law was a proposal to reduce the amount of state-maintained mileage, mainly by shedding the many miles of minor and local service roads the state had accumulated over the years for political and other reasons. According to one proposal by the Louisiana Legislative Council, the or so which existed in the state system at the time would have been ultimately reduced to around through the turnback of all but the most important farm-to-market roads. Thus to this day, Louisiana retains an inordinately large state highway system which continues to contain many miles of roads that would be otherwise locally maintained in other states. Louisiana's state highway system ranks 10th nationally as a proportion of all road miles in the state. The 1955 renumbering renumbered all routes based on an A-B-C system of route classification: A was primary, B secondary, and C farm-to-market. The A routes mainly comprised one and two digit highways. The B routes primarily comprised three digit routes below 300. All routes 300 through 1241, along with parts or all of a very few lower-numbered routes, were classified C routes. Numerical clustering was and is still apparent in the ranks of routes 300 and up (excluding 3xxx routes), especially with routes 700 and above. The A and B \\"primary\\" route range was 1 to 185. No 2xx numbers were used; this range may have been intended as an expansion area for future primary route designations (this was never done). LA 191 was added around 1980 as the Toledo Bend Scenic Drive; is the only primary route designation to be added after 1955. Odd numbers in 1955 and thereafter were assigned to cardinal north-south routes and even numbers to east‚Äìwest routes as in the federal U.S. and Interstate highway systems; this practice is consistently adhered to in primary routes (lower numbers), but anomalies have occurred in the four-digit numbers. Prior to 1955 the numbering pattern was essentially the obverse, meaning that almost all the numbers changed in 1955.A rare exception was LA 15, a highly trafficked road which went on a diagonal, providing a perception that it could be considered either north‚Äìsouth or east‚Äìwest, and thus it remained with the same number. Another rare exception was LA 6 The 1955 route redesignations took effect on June 30 of 1955.  Post-1955 numbering practices  I-59 (some 20 miles farther east) should continue straight onto I-12 eastbound. 3xxx designations were given to all new post-1955 SRs, and were the only new type designations, until around the year 2000 when 12xx designations began to be assigned to new routes, starting with 1242 and working up (1241 is the highest-designated 1955 route). State routes in any range can and have been removed from the system, and there are many corresponding gaps in the numerical sequence. Numbers of deleted routes are not recycled into new routes as they are in other states; generally a new 12xx number is assigned when a new number is needed. Many newer route designations are given to roads long having been on the state rolls, but which have been severed or isolated from its former designation by newer construction. Despite the high numbers, some roadways in the 3XXX series are major, heavily trafficked thoroughfares; an example is LA 3132, a connector between I-20 and I-49 in Shreveport‚Äîand a rare example, in Louisiana, of a state highway built in the multilane, divided, access-fully-controlled format typical of interstate highways. Official US highway-state highway number duplications have been disallowed since 1955, but interstate-state highway duplications are permitted, and all interstate routes except 210 and 220 are duplicated in the rolls of state highway numbers. Most state highways with the same numbers as interstates are a comfortable distance away, with two exceptions: LA 59 and I-59, which exist within of each other in St. Tammany Parish, and which both intersect I-12; and LA 10 and I-10, which both flow east‚Äìwest across south Louisiana. The confusion between LA 59 and I-59 became so substantial on the eastbound concourse of I-12 that Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has posted \\"TO I-59\\" signs at the bottom of the eastbound exit ramp from I-12 at LA 59 to redirect, back to I-12 eastbound, motorists who confuse LA 59 as I-59.  \\"Hyphenated\\" routes  The Louisiana state highway system's most ubiquitous and unique anachronism is the infamous \\"hyphenated\\" routes. These routes were created with the 1955 renumbering, and are a legacy of the assumption by the state through the years of many otherwise local streets in cities and towns throughout the state. The state- maintained city streets were/are often short sections of road, usually interconnected with other state-maintained local streets in the vicinity. Because of the interconnectedness of these state-maintained streets, as well as their close proximity and extremely short length, it was decided for practical purposes not to separately number each and every street in a town as a separate state route. Instead, each street was deemed a 'section' of a larger whole, with the aggregate comprising a single state highway; this becomes obvious when reading the 1955 statute that defines the newly redesignated state highways. The separate sections are denoted by numbers in the statute, which correspond in signage to the last digit in a hyphenated route number. For example, LA 560-3 is section 3 of LA 560. Similar as it may sound, this method is different from state route legislative definitions in states such as California, where state routes are often defined as existing in disjoint sections; but in these cases, there is often a linear continuity of a route through cosigning or implied connections made via other routes. In Louisiana's case, the base \\"route\\" usually resembles a web-like or disconnected pattern; thus the distinction between sections in signage‚Äîor else there would be multiple, often intersecting routes with the same number, and real confusion would ensue. Over the years many of these hyphenated state routes have been returned to local control, thus deleting parts of, or entire \\"families\\" of, hyphenated routes. For example, the LA 466 family originally had 17 sections, all within the city of Gretna in Jefferson Parish. Most of these sections have been turned back to local control; the remaining section lost its \\"hyphen\\" and was renumbered as plain LA 466. In Baton Rouge, the LA 950 family had 17 sections; all are extinct. Some families still survive intact, such as the six sections of the LA 830 family in Bastrop. A few have been renumbered, almost always to 3000-series routes: LA 3155 in Metairie was once LA 611-13, and former portions of LA 611-3 and 611-4 that were severed from the rest of their routes were redesignated LA 3261 and LA 3262, respectively. Invariably, hyphenated routes are short, local streets that seemingly serve no state-level purpose whatsoever; many are dead ends, residential side streets, etc., and sometimes end in arbitrary places. The majority of these routes can be found in urbanized areas, though there are a few that exist in rural surroundings. All of the hyphenated routes in the nomenclature are found among the original secondary SR system (routes 300 to 1241). There are no 3000-series hyphenates because all hyphenates were created with the 1955 renumbering (the 3xxx routes were later additions/renumberings).

Grant's Central Mississippi campaign ( November 2, 1862‚ÄîJanuary 10, 1863) culminated in the Siege of Vicksburg (June 11‚ÄîJuly 4, 1863), one of the most important Union victories of the war. It opened the Mississippi River for the Union and cut the Confederacy in half.McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 637; Woodworth, Victory, pp. 454-55; Sherman, Memoirs, p. 370. The Vicksburg victory effectively finished the Confederacy in the West, severing Texas, Arkansas and large parts of Louisiana from the remainder of the insurgent states. Vicksburg's surrender was followed by the campaign against the Confederacy's 4th largest city, Mobile, Alabama, which fell after the siege and capture of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely (February 17‚ÄîApril 12, 1865).

The program is headquartered in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Program Parelli Natural Horsemanship states its core principle as \\"Horsemanship can be obtained naturally through communication, understanding and psychology, versus mechanics, fear and intimidation.\\" Parelli's methods were first publicized by Robert M. Miller in a series of articles in Western Horseman magazine in 1983 and 1984.Miller, p. 37 In 1993, Parelli published his first book, Natural Horse-Man-Ship, co-authored by Kathy Kadash Swan and with photography by Parelli's first wife, Karen. The Parelli program is now promoted as co-founded by Parelli and his second wife, Linda. The Parelli program is offered through courses in Colorado and Florida, and includes a four-part training program of horsemanship referred to as \\"The Four Savvys\\". The exercises developed by Parelli that emulate these behaviors are referred to as the \\"7 Games\\". The \\"Parelli Natural Horsemanship University\\" was approved as a \\"private occupational school\\" by the Colorado Department of Higher Education in 2003. It is listed under the state's Division of Private Occupational Schools as a private, for-profit institution.  The Four Savvys  \\"The Four Savvys\\" are defined by the Parellis as types of play with horses. Two of these, Online and Liberty, involve the human on the ground, and the horse typically is in a halter with an attached lead rope, but other methods of connection such a flank rope are also used. Liberty play involves a horse who is not physically connected to the human. Instead, the horse is asked to watch the body language of the human as its primary source of information about what they are supposed to be doing. The two riding categories are named Freestyle and Finesse. Freestyle consists of riding with infrequent or no contact with the horse's head or mouth. In finesse, the rider generally keeps close but gentle head/mouth contact and uses communication from body cues developed by practice with freestyle riding to give instructions to the horse about gross motor skill topics such as gait and direction while reserving the reins for discussions regarding refined elements such as bend in the body. The 7 Games Within the four savvys, Parelli Natural Horsemanship teaches the use of the \\"7 Games\\" with horses. The Parellis state that these exercises emulate the behaviors that horses engage in with each other. The first three games are also known as the principal games, as the other four games, called the purpose games, consist of elements of these three games. The seven games are: #Friendly: also known as the confidence game, is designed to demonstrate to the horse that the human and their tools are not a threat and to establish a rapport with the horse. #Porcupine: a game of steady pressure that motivates the horse to move away from that pressure to obtain relief. # Driving: a game of rhythmic pressure that is used to motivate the horse to move. #Yo-yo: a game of \\"back and forth,\\" which can mean that the horse backs away from the human and returns. Another type of yo-yo game involves the horse speeding up or slowing down. #Circling: often compared to longeing the horse, although Parelli asserts that the two are distinctly different. In the Circling Game, it is the horse's responsibility to maintain both the requested gait and direction instead of the human's responsibility to enforce the gait and direction. #Sideways: a game where the human causes the horse to move laterally. #Squeeze: a game where the human causes the horse to \\"squeeze\\" between objects. Horsenality The program uses a concept the Parellis call ‚Äúhorsenality‚Äù to explain the behavior of individual horses. The system is based on a model originally conceived by Linda Parelli but which was subjected to independent research by psychometric personality research specialists and that was overseen by statisticians at the Department of Education at the University of Kansas. Research consisted of assessing how experienced \\"horse\\" people in general view the differences in horses. Responses were subjected to the statistical process of factor analysis and two primary factors were derived. These orthogonal (opposite) factors were presented in a quadrant configuration labeled LBI, LBE, RBI, and RBE. There are many variants and overlapping grey zones that allow for more specific descriptions of horses. Again these are based on how humans view horses and therefore tend to approach them. The goal is to provide a positive language for perceiving horses and use this terminology to link to recommended natural training approaches. A parallel model of assessing how people view themselves, also based on independent factor analysis, was created. Called Humanality, it allows people to look at their behavioral tendencies and explore what horse training strategies come natural to them and which ones they need to invest more time and practice in learning, especially if it is a method that works best with a particular horse. The objective is to customize natural horsemanship in ways that best serve the horse. Both Horsenality and Humanality were developed independently from original research and the rigid statistical process of factor analysis. Horsenality and Humanality have no relationship to other assessments such as the MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator), Marston's DiSC, or the Big Five (OCEAN). Any independent studies of correlations with these assessments, research into differences in horses, or examinations of differences in how people view horses is encouraged and will be supported by the Parelli organization. The more PNH can learn about how to help humans make the world a better place for horses, the better. Endorsements and invitations Karen and David O'Connor appeared in a video with Parelli at the 2002 Rolex Kentucky Three Day Event.http://www.thehorse.com/articles/13194/parelli-pennings-my-experience Craig Johnson has ridden in PNH demonstrations, Walter Zettl has given Linda private dressage lessons for several years and features various Parelli products on his website. Other people who are well known in the equestrian world, such as Julie Krone, have said positive things about the Parelli method. Lauren Barwick, a gold- and silver-winning Paralympian dressage rider, has been coached by Parelli.\\"Canadian Para-Equestrian Lauren Barwick Shines At 2011 Dressage Affaire\\", www.therider.com, retrieved 28 February 2016 Robert M. Miller has spoken favorably of Parelli in his books. Pat Parelli appeared on The Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan in the episode, \\"Cesar and the Horse Whisperer,\\" and Millan has participated in one Parelli tour stop. In 2003, Pat Parelli was given an audience with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to demonstrate PNH and to interact with some of the Queen's horses. In 2009, The Humane Society of the United States named Pat Parelli as its Humane Horseman of the Year for \\"outstanding commitment to improving the welfare of America's horses\\". Controversy There has been criticism of the more prominent natural horsemanship practitioners in general, including Parelli (as well as Clinton Anderson and John Lyons), with suggestions that the movement is cultlike, in the sense that some practitioners and their followers condemn all other training methods, and that it is \\"gimmicky and over-commercialized,\\" sells overpriced materials, and charges \\"exorbitant\\" prices for clinics and to obtain certification as a trainer. There is tension between the mainstream world of horse training and natural horsemanship advocates, each highly critical of the other. Critics assert that Parelli has merely renamed traditional training techniques such as longeing, and in doing so, he markets horsemanship information that is widely available and has been passed down for generations, considered to be common sense by those knowledgeable of the horse. Critics of Parelli consider his methods to be inappropriately described as exclusive to the Parelli system. That said, Parelli agrees that his methods are not particularly new, and credits those from whom he learned.The Revolution in Horsemanship By Robert M. Miller, Richard A. Lamb, Rick Lamb, Hugh Downs. p. 36 Parelli has been criticized for renaming and rebranding standard horse training equipment that he sells for premium prices, critics noting that Parelli and non-Parelli versions of natural horsemanship equipment are virtually indistinguishable. Parelli advocates point to differences in materials and design in Parelli equipment, though similar designs are widely available outside of the Parelli brand. Concerns have been raised that Parelli's methods may be \\"problematic\\" when used by less experienced horse handlers. What can be learned in a three-day clinic may not be adequate without additional hands-on guideance, especially in difficult circumstances such as adopting a rescue horse that presents additional challenges. Others note that similar difficulties can be expected in any circumstance wherein an inexperienced person is handling a horse without professional supervision. Parelli has commented that it is impossible to learn how to be a natural horseman \\"overnight\\" simply by watching his videos.Hofstetter, p. 111 The Parellis have been subject to criticism because in most of their materials, they do not wear equestrian helmets and have published statements indicating they did not personally advocate their use other than for certain high-risk activities. In 2009 they amended their position, by publishing a statement on Facebook advocating helmet use for beginners, requiring it for children under 18 at their own facility, and advising all riders \\"to thoroughly evaluate their situation\\". , they still do not advocate helmets for all riders in spite of Linda Parelli having been \\"knocked out\\" as a result of a fall from a horse that stumbled in May 2009. Video controversies In March 2010, video excerpts from a copyrighted Parelli training video were uploaded to YouTube, showing Linda Parelli handling a one-eyed horse on a lead rope. Some criticized Parelli for handling the horse in a rough manner. The Parellis later uploaded an interview where they address the abuse accusations. In mid-2010 Pat Parelli was videoed working with a stallion using a gum-line and holding up the horse's front leg with a rope. According to Horse & Hound, this demonstration caused an online \\"furore\\" with many angry comments about abuse. Parelli asserted that the horse was a risk to his handlers and an extreme example of equine behavior. The British Showjumping Association stated that the horse was found to be fit and well, and the owner of the horse, Robert Whitaker, said he felt the situation had been blown out of proportion.

Henry's lack of success on the court results in his coach requesting that he renounce the four-year scholarship the school has given him. Henry refuses, whereupon the coach not only benches Henry but subjects him to unfair treatment and discipline in practice designed to make him quit. Janet continues to help Henry with his class work and they develop a romantic relationship. With the team's undefeated record in jeopardy, a teammate's injury results in Henry being sent into a game by the coach, instructed not to shoot the ball. Defying orders, Henry leads the team's comeback, makes the game-winning shot and is carried off the court on other players' shoulders. Back in the coach's good graces, he is assured his future at the school is no longer at risk, but Henry bluntly informs the coach exactly what he can do with his scholarship, as he \\"can play anywhere.\\" Cast * Robby Benson - Henry Steele * Annette O'Toole - Janet Hays * G.

Rudolph * Cory Faucher - Tom * Charles Fleischer - High School Student The film's director, Lamont Johnson, appears briefly as an alumni sponsor, part of a sub-plot regarding a win-at-all-costs corruption in the school's athletic programs. Production The film was shot in 1975, primarily at Highland High school in Ault, Colorado and at various locations on the campus of Colorado State University in Fort Collins. The working title was Catch a Falling Star.McBride, Joseph (June 15, 1977). \\"Film Reviews: One on One\\". Variety. 21. Despite preview audiences and many critics comparing the film to Rocky, that movie had not yet been released when One on One was being shot. Many scenes filmed in Eugene, Oregon at MacArthur Court, not mentioned in ending credits. Reception The film has an 86% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that it was \\"funny and touching and makes you feel good.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times stated that despite how predictable the film was, \\"predictability has the effect of enriching our interest as we wait to see not what will happen but how it's brought about. A lot of the success of the 'how' in 'One on One' has to do with the performance by writer-actor Benson, whose clean-cut na√Øvet√© masks a surprising moral strength, which, even if it's not very common, is something we'd all like to believe in.\\"Canby, Vincent (August 25, 1977). \\"Film: 'One on One' Scores for Fair Play\\". The New York Times. 64. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times declared that \\"the customers who liked 'Rocky' will find a whole lot to like in the film ... It is brisk, pointed, very funny and greatly engaging.\\"Champlin, Charles (August 3, 1977). \\"An Athlete Goes 'One on One'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Joseph McBride of Variety called it \\"a trite and disappointing little film\\" that \\"follows the 'Rocky' formula about the underdog-turned-hero but fails to ignite the emotions.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and praised \\"good performances in a well-directed script. We end up caring about Henry while the film tells us a lot about college sports.\\"Siskel, Gene (August 18, 1977). \\"Good script makes 'One' fine film\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 12. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \\"a wobbly attempt at junior division 'Rocky,'\\" with \\"fitfully appealing interludes\\" but \\"Whenever the mood shifts toward True Romance or pathos, the movie begins to disintegrate.\\"Arnold, Gary (July 2, 1977). \\"'One on One': An Unhip Hoopster\\". The Washington Post. C8. Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the screenwriters \\"take the easy way out, opting for the old Hollywood winning-through-against-all-odds formula which makes their sporting hero's final rejection of his mentor-cum-tormentor both irrelevant and gratuitous and not in the least the 'surprise' ending that was intended.\\" Soundtrack The music was written by Charles Fox, with lyrics by Paul Williams. Seals and Crofts provided the vocals. The track \\"My Fair Share\\" reached #28 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 19 November 1977 and was #182 in the Canadian Top 200 of 1977.

Afemai people occupy six local government areas of Edo state: Etsako West, with headquarters in Auchi, Etsako Central, Etsako East, Owan East, Owan West and Akoko Edo. These make up the Edo-North Senatorial District. Name The Afemai are also known as the Afenmai, Etsako, Etsakor, Iyekhee, or Yekhee people. In Benin, they are also known as Ivbiosakon people.Ademola Iyi Eweka. \\"Edo People.\\" Edo World. Accessed 12 May 2014. Previously the name used by British colonial administration was Kukuruku, supposedly after a battle cry \\"ku-ku-ruku\\", now considered derogatory. Language The Afenmai language is a Ghotou-Uneme- Yekhee language, belonging to the North-Central branch of Edoid languages. Afemai is closely related to Edo. Afemai has several documented dialects: * Auchi (\\"Yekhee\\") * Avainwu (Fugar) * Aviele * Ekperi * Ivhiadaobi * South Ibie (South Ivbie) * Uwepa-Uwano (Weppa Wano) * Uzanu, Anegbette, Udochi, Imiava [Uneme] * Uzairue. * Okpameri * Owan * Okpella/Okpekpe/ North Ibie (\\"Ivie\\") History Afemai is made of several kingdoms and clans (large villages/townships ruled traditionally by monarchs) and many of them seem to have their own oral history versions of the origin of Afemai as well as its own starting point in history. Historical accounts claimed that they migrated from Benin, during the tyrannical rule of Oba Ewuare, the greatest warrior legend and the most outstanding king in the history of Benin Empire. ‚ÄúThe title Ewuare (Oworuare), meaning \\"all is well\\" or the trouble has ceased and as a result the war is over. The title symbolizes an epoch of reconciliation, reconstruction and the return of peace among the warring factions in Benin between 1435-1440 AD. Shortly after this critical period of war, Akalaka and his two sons Ekpeye and Ogba migrated further southeast to first settle at Ula-Ubie, and subsequently other groups moved out of Benin City and migrated north. However, it has recently become clear that there were people living in Afemailand prior to the migration from Benin City.

Hobbies Most people are hardworking, schooling and traveling. Government The Afemais do not have a central traditional ruler, but some of the prominent traditional institutions and rulers in Afemai land are the Okumagbe of Weppa Wanno (Agenebode), Ogieneni of Uzairue (Jattu), Aidonogie of south Ibie, Otaru of Auchi, Oba of Agbede, Otaru of Igarra, Ukor of Ihievbe, Oliola of Anegbette, Okumagbe of Iuleha clan, Okuopellagbe of Okpella etc. Afemai have produced many illustrious personalities in both national and international levels. Tourist attractions, which span the expanse of Afemai, are exemplified by the Ise Lake in Agenebode (Weppa Wanno clan) Etsakor East, the Ososo hills (featured in an edition of Gulder Ultimate search), the famous Kukuruku hills and the Somorika hills in Akoko Edo. Somorika hills consist of an extended expanse of hills crowned by massive boulders perched precariously on the summits of hills and alongside seemingly inadequate locations on the sides. Some of the most important towns/clans in Afemai land are Agenebode(Weppa-Wanno), Weppa, Oshiolo, Emokwemhe Iviagbapue, Auchi, Ihievbe, Afuze, Anegbette, Warrake, Iviukwe, South Ibie, Agbede, Sabongida Ora, Igarra, Ekperi, Jattu, Fugar, Aviele, Okpella, Uneme Ehrunrun, Uneme Osu, Iviukhua, Ososo, Uzanu, Uzebba, Iviukhua, Weppa, Okpella, Okpekpe, Somorika etc. The autonomous clans, towns, villages and kingdoms in Afemai land are currently administratively arranged as follows under the current six local government areas: * Etsako East LGA, Agenebode: :Agenebode, Oshiolo, Iviagbapue, Imiakebu, Afana, Imiegba, Itsukwi, Emokweme, Ekwothor, Iviukhua, Okpella, Okpekpe, Iviebua, Ibie, Weppa, Uzanu City * Etsako Central LGA, Fugar: :Fugar, Ekperi, Ogbona, Anegbette, Udochi * Estako West LGA, Auchi: :Auchi, South Ibie, Agbede, Awain Community( Ewora, Eware, Ibvioba, Ama, Idegun, etc.) Jattu, Afashio, Ayogwiri, Aviele, Iyorah, Ikabigbo, Afowa, Irekpai, Ugbenor, Idato, * Owan East LGA, Afuze :Afuze, Warrake, Igue, Ihievbe, Ikao, Ivbi-Mion, Ive-Ada-Obi, Otuo and Uokha * Owan West LGA, Sabongida Ora: :Sabongida Ora, Iuleha Clan * Akoko Edo LGA, Igarra: :Igarra, Ibillo, Uneme Osu, Uneme Ehrunrun, Ojah, Ososo, Somorika, Aviawun (Iviawu) is one of the popular clans in Afemai. It comprises 1 Unone 2 Arua 3 Ogbona 4 Iriakhor Awun is the father of Unone Arua Ogbona Iriakhor and Awun migrated from Benin Kingdom and settle in the present Fugar. Unone and Arua make up the present Fugar. The origin of Aviawun Clan Awun is said to be migrated from Benin Kingdom during the 15th century and he left Benin Kingdom because of the iron hand the Oba of Benin was applying on its subjects. He first settled at Jettu and the natives of Jettu did not welcome him, so he further migrated eastward and settled in the present Fugar. It was said that when he arrived at Fugar, he did not see any big trees and the only tree he saw that could shade him and his family was not big enough. This particular tree still exists to the present day. The tree is named Agbabo. It is a traditional tree and no Awun descendant dares cut it. It is also considered a tourist attraction Religion The Etsako people were originally practitioners of the African Traditional Religion. However, with advent of Christianity and Islam, many got converted to those religions. Etsako people are predominantly Christian today, perhaps due to largely the arrival of the early missionaries at the Waterside in Agenebode. However, high concentrations of Muslims can be found around Auchi, Agbede and perhaps, the Okpella axis.

Districts of Dallgow-D√∂beritz  * Dallgow (with Neu- D√∂beritz) * Rohrbeck * Seeburg  History  The Imperial German Army established the proving ground in 1894 around the historic village of D√∂beritz, which had to be abandoned by its inhabitants. Its pioneering airfield was, in late 1915, the place where the world's first practical all- metal aircraft, the Junkers J 1, made its pioneering flights. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in neighboring Berlin, it hosted the riding part of the modern pentathlon and part of the equestrian eventing competitions.1936 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. pp. 830, 894. Between 1945 and 1951 Dallgow served as East German border crossing for cars travelling along F 5 between the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (till 1949, thereafter the East German Democratic Republic) or the British Zone of Occupation (till 1949) and thereafter the West German Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin. The traffic was subject to the Interzonal traffic regulations. After the East German Volkspolizei took control of West-Staaken on 1 February 1951 the checkpoint was moved up more eastwards. The municipality shared its borders with the former West Berlin, and so during the period 1961-1990 it was separated from it by the Berlin Wall.

He is known for attracting corporate interest in the coal deposits of Eastern Kentucky and Southwestern Virginia, leading to the development of commercial coal mining in the region. The creation of the broad form deed is also attributed to Mayo in the early 1900s. Early life Mayo was born in Gulnare, Kentucky to Thomas Jefferson Mayo and Mary E. Leslie Mayo. His family moved to Johnson County, Kentucky in 1870 from Pike County, Kentucky where they established their home in Paintsville. Mayo attended subscription schools until he enrolled to Kentucky Wesleyan College in Millersburg. He graduated class of 1879 and began teaching school in Paintsville at the age of 22. While attending college, Mayo had realized the potential of coal and other mineral deposits in the Big Sandy Valley. Rise to wealth During his teaching tenure, Mayo began to buy land and mineral rights in using his teaching salary. He would in turn sell the land or the rights to the land to eastern iron and coal companies at a considerable profit, while convincing them to invest in exploration and mining of the region. Mayo formed a real estate company in 1888 that specialized in acquiring land and mineral rights in Eastern Kentucky and Southwestern Virginia. In 1889, the company became known as the Paintsville Coal and Mining Company. Within two years, the Paintsville Coal and Mining Company owned nearly all of the Elkhorn Creek Coalfield. Mayo (left) with other businessmen in front of the Jenkins Hotel Mayo's land began to increase in value in 1893. After he displayed coal from his land at the Chicago's World Fair, a wealthy businessman named Peter L. Kimberley purchased $10,000 in the company's holdings. This money was used to further expand the land and mineral rights owned by the Paintsville Coal and Mining Company. In 1901, Mayo founded the Northern Coal and Coke Company and transferred his landholdings in Johnson, Floyd, and Lawrence counties in Kentucky into the company. This greatly increased Mayo's wealth as he received $250,000 and 25% in company stocks. The Northern Coal and Coke Company controlled in the Elkhorn Coal Field when it sold the company sold its land holdings and mineral rights to Consolidation Coal Company in 1909. Mayo Mansion Mayo Mansion By 1905, Mayo had amassed enough wealth to build a larger home in Paintsville. He had married Alice Jane Meek and they now had two children, John C.C. 2nd and Mary Margaret. Mayo had originally planned a modest twenty room house, but following trips to the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, and having in 1904 acquired Varina Farms, the Powhatan Plantation in Mayo's ancestral Virginia, he decided to build a mansion which would rival those he had seen. His plans were expanded for a classic revival mansion with forty rooms. Construction broke ground in a swampy area. The construction crews filled in the swampy area and then went to work on building the foundation for the estate. Sandstone used in the foundation was mined from his father's farm on the other side of Paint Creek. The stones were then transported from the farm across a distance of three- quarters of a mile by an overhead tram. The stone columns surrounding the exterior of the mansion were each transported through the creek during dry periods on sleds pulled by twenty-oxen teams. The masonry for the mansion was performed by Italian stonemasons from Cincinnati. Originally, light was to be provided in the mansion by using carbide gas, but near the end of construction, Paintsville received electrical service. The plans for the mansion were changed to include electrical wiring. The mansion was also designed to include running water, by pumping water from a well to a cistern and then to the house as required. Rain water from the gutters went into the cistern and in turn to the house also. Construction of the mansion was completed in December 1912 with costs in excess of $250,000 ($ in dollars). Mayo Mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 3, 1974. Mayo's office in Paintsville Politics Mayo was a millionaire by 1910, and he was already exerting political influence. He used portions of his wealth to help elect governors and congressmen. He also contributed heavily to the presidential campaign of Woodrow Wilson. He is the only eastern Kentuckian to ever be a member of the Democratic National Committee. Final years The procession of Mayo In 1913, Mayo went on a three-month tour of Europe, including London and other foreign capitals. This tour was a trip of both business and pleasure. On August 20, he returned to Paintsville. An elaborate reception was given by John E. Buckingham, a close friend of Mayo. Citizens from all over the area went to welcome back \\"Johnson County's most prominent resident\\". Unknown to the guests at the reception, Mayo was already suffering from Bright's Disease. It was soon released to the public that Mayo was ill. Originally, the newspapers reported that Mayo had pneumonia and was resting at his mansion. Mayo didn't stay resting for long. A week later, Mayo conducted business as usual, but citizens of Paintsville could tell he was seriously ill. Specialists were soon called in from Cincinnati. Mayo had been experiencing periods of unconsciousness according to reports. Bright's Disease had attacked the function of the liver, but news reports were still hopeful for a quick recovery. On March 1, 1914, Mayo was taken by special train to the Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, where an entire floor was occupied. Historical marker in Paintsville commemorating the life of Mayo. Bulletins were issued almost daily on Mayo's condition, often conflicting. In late April, Mayo was finally moved to the Waldorf Astoria in New York City where another group of specialists were in wait to care for him. On May 9, it was announced that Mayo had developed peritonitis. He died two days later, on May 11, 1914 at the Waldorf Astoria, which is now the site of the Empire State Building. Nearly 5,000 people attended his funeral on May 14, 1914. Funeral services were held at what is now known as Mayo Memorial United Methodist Church, the same church that Mayo had built just across the street from his mansion and to which Andrew Carnegie had donated the pipe organ. The governor of the Commonwealth, James B. McCreary, brought a delegation of state officials to Mayo's funeral. Senator Clarence Wayland Watson and Representative C. Bascom Slemp represented the U.S. Congress. Citizens of Johnson County held a vigil at the train station until the train carrying Mayo's body pulled into the terminal. Mayo's body was transported to Mayo Mansion to lie in state. From the announcement of Mayo's death on May 11, until after the funeral, all of the towns businesses and banks were closed. At the time of his death, Mayo was the wealthiest person in the state of Kentucky with US $20 million in assets ($ in dollars).Whenever he could get a little money saved up he would buy an option on a piece of land appalachianhistory.net.

History Founded in 1899, by Henry Augustus Pevear, and then known as the Stetson Home for Boys began as an orphanage. It supported itself as a commercial dairy farm wherein each of its capable residents worked to help support the institution. During its early history, this institution maintained a primary school for training its residents. Secondary schooling was not required in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the time of its founding. Once Massachusetts required school attendance up to sixteen years of age, residents requiring secondary education attended the Barre, Massachusetts High School. Notwithstanding its lack of educational facilities at the time, i.e., classes only to the 8th grade, the Stetson Home for Boys became known as the Stetson School, which continues today. Stetson Home from the air By the 1960s, Stetson began treatment for emotionally disturbed boys, often from broken homes, who had suffered some form of abuse or neglect. Later, Massachusetts General Laws (MCG) Chapter 766 legislation passed, and Stetson started a program approved by the Massachusetts Board of Education. At that time, its educational levels extended to the 12th grade so the resident‚Äôs attendance in an external school was no longer required. In 1990, Stetson began to admit juvenile males with a history of sexually abusive behaviors, which continues to this day. By 1994, Stetson specialized in treating male children with sexual behavior problems. In the early 2000s, Stetson began to lose financial and clinical ground. A study was released by UNH demonstrating the futility of rehabilitating sexually abusive teenagers. This led to a sudden drop-off in placements. Incidents of managerial staff behaving inappropriately contributed to the school's continued decline. In March of 2013 Stetson School became an affiliate of the Seven Hills Foundation of Worcester, Mass. The school has since undergone a welcomed change in managerial staff and overcome many of its past problems. They have since shifted their custodial model from providing care for male children with sexual behavior problems to attachment-oriented, trauma-informed, and developmentally sensitive treatment.

Its campus is located in Mabalacat, Pampanga, Philippines. This school was named after St. John Bosco whom the Catholic Church has proclaimed as the \\"Father and Teacher of Youth.\\" St. John Bosco dedicated his life to education of the youth. To continue this work, he founded a religious congregation of priests and brothers - the Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB). History Statue of Don Bosco School Field Don Bosco in the Philippines The presence of Don Bosco in the Philippines began in 1912 when two Salesian priests arrived in the Parish of Nuestra de los Remedios in Malate, Manila. Ten years later, the Rt. Rev. Msgr. William Piani, SDB and Rev. Louis Morrow, SDB were appointed Delegate and Secretary respectively. The Salesian mission in the Philippines took a more definite shape with the designation of Rev. Fr. Charles Braga, SDB as the first Provincial Superior. He paved the way for the establishment of a permanent Salesian Society in the country. The first Salesian educational institution, St. John Bosco Academy, was founded in 1947 in Tarlac, Tarlac. A second institution was established in 1952 at Victorias, Negros Occidental, and was followed by other schools in Mandaluyong in 1953, in Cebu and in Makati in 1954 and eventually Pampanga in 1956.Don Bosco Pampanga official website Development The years that followed saw an ever-increasing enrollment of students that paved the way for the construction of more buildings and facilities inside the DBA campus. The grade school curriculum offering expanded to add Grades 3 to 4. In 1963, a fourth edifice was added. This was the two-story Juniorate or Salesian School for Minor Seminarians. A large multi-purpose gymnasium was also built on the same year to house the sports and cultural facilities of the school. As DBA's fame grew, it saw a continuous expansion of its campus facilities and a significant increase in student population to a point that the school had to regulate enrollment admissions in the form of entrance exams and interviews. Relocation Lahar covered most of the buildings of Don Bosco Academy in 1995. The school almost transferred in another province if not for the intervention of Archbishop Paciano Aniceto, D.D. of the Archdiocese of San Fernando. Through the generous offering of the Benedictine Sisters, they allowed Don Bosco Academy to hold classes in their school shifting with their students (Monday to Wednesday for the Scholasticans and Thursday to Saturday for the Bosconians). This continued until Don Bosco Academy was given a second founding in 1996 in the northern town of Mabalacat, Pampanga. Don Bosco Academy was transplanted in this area and the Salesian charism and system of education continued. Generous benefactors in the form of the heirs of the late Mr. & Mrs. Tomas and Maria Dizon donated a four-hectare land in Barangay Mabiga of this town to the rebuilding of Don Bosco Academy. In May 2009, the School opened its newest wing, consisting of the St. Francis Auditorium, where some events are held. The Savio Hall holds meetings or some classes if the rooms are not available. Lastly, the General Science and Biology Laboratories and the computer rooms have been moved to the newest wing. In 2010, Don Bosco Academy inaugurated the gymnasium for badminton together with the expansion of the dining hall of the Salesian Residence in time for the visit of the Regional Superior of the Salesians of Don Bosco, Fr. Vaclav Clement, SDB. At about August 2011, a new room was built, the Collaborative Classroom, wherein a section will spend 1 day of a regular school day in this classroom, bringing their laptops for various activities. Each day a section is scheduled, starting from the 4th years going down to the Grade Seven. With the help of the Parents' Council, the Grade School football field was improved in the summer of 2012. Top soil was placed on it and drainage system was installed to avoid the flooding of the field. In early 2014, two flagpoles were built as part of the A.P. Club's and school year's legacy project. On March 11, 2015, the renovation on the school chapel started. A new wing on the High School Building is currently being considered for the expansion for the K-12 program.

The present village was developed in the 19th century to house those working the flax mills on the nearby Ceres Burn. From 1681 the minister for the parish was Alexander Edward, until 1689 when he was deprived as a non- juror. He went on to become an architect and landscape architect, working on schemes for Brechin Castle and Hamilton Palace. The civil parish has a population of 558 (in 2011).Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC ‚Äì Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland. Web site http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ retrieved March 2016. See ‚ÄúStandard Outputs‚Äù, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930 History The name of the village is from the Scottish Gaelic Ceann Bac meaning 'End of the Corner', from ceann meaning 'head' or 'end' and bac meaning 'hindrance', 'bend' or 'corner', particularly in a field used as a shelter for livestock. Transatlantic Radiophone Station ;Kemback G.P.O. Transatlantic Radiophone Station (1927‚Äì1950s) In 1927 the General Post Office opened a commercial radiophone service between Kemback and an AT&T; site in New Jersey, USA. All that remains (2010) is a metal gate into an open field opposite the Kemback graveyard. The field was originally full of wooden huts, and the hill, and surrounding areas in the parish, were covered in aerials. The civilian GPO services were moved when line of sight was needed for television transmissions during the 1950s. WWII Secret Access to most of North Fife was restricted. The Kemback Radio Station was a critical link between Britain and the US, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Classed ULTRA secret, the Kemback station was also needed in the event of a retreat from England, and the loss of the transatlantic cables by the British forces and an equivalent Transatlantic RadioPhone site at Rugby, England. Obviously this eventuality was never needed. Wartime records of the Station's use for radio interception as part of the network of Y-stations for German Enigma machine transmissions are still restricted, and have not been released into the public domain. It is unclear if the records survive in the National Archives or Bletchley Park. Several staff based in GPO Kemback were transferred to the Far East in the early days of WW2 to Singapore. Some were captured, and held as prisoners of the Japanese for the remainder of the war. Medical conditions The extremely marshy land immediately around the old and new Kemback churches was drained in the 17th and 18th centuries. A local condition called The Drop or The Ague is recorded in the histories of the Lairds of Kemback, and the archive of the Archbishop John Spottiswoode(1565‚Äì1639) which, although cannot be confirmed, is probably a form of malaria, similar to that seen in the Somerset levels.

He rose to the position of president and chief executive officer of Cushman & Wakefield in 1960, became chairman of the board of directors and its chief executive officer in 1970, and honorary chairman in 1976, closing many of the industry's most notable transactions along the way. He oversaw an expansion of the business into a nationwide force and was credited with transforming Cushman & Wakefield from a family-owned building management concern into a leading real estate services organization. As agent or consultant, Peters represented almost every major investment builder, as well as many large institutional owners in the industrial, banking and insurance fields around the U.S. and abroad. He was also instrumental in the development of several of America's most prominent office towers, including the Bank of America Building in San Francisco, Arco Towers in Los Angeles, and 4 New York Plaza, among many others.

The son of Gilbert fitz William of Hameldone, and an unknown wife, possibly Isabelle Randolph. He is the first historically confirmed progenitor of the House of Hamilton, which includes the Dukes of Hamilton, Dukes of Abercorn and Earls of Haddington. Origins There is some confusion as to the ancestry of his grandfather, William de Hameldone, who could, it has been argued, be descended from the Umfraville family of Northumberland or the Beaumont Earls of Leicester. Both assertions are based on armorial evidence (both families used Cinquefoils in their arms), and references to various Hamilton place-names in Northumberland and Leicestershire. The Leicester connection is considered more likely as Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester is known to have had a son William but Heraldry expert A.C. Fox Davies has suggested the early Beaumont Earls of Leicester bore the arms Gules, a lion rampant queue-fourchee argent following the work of Sir Anthony Wagner's History of Heraldry of Britain who cited the Great Coucher Book of the Duchy of Lancaster. Bruce A. McAndrew, in his work, Scotland's Historical Heraldry, argues for the Umfraville connection: :\\"The earliest representation of the Hamilton arms appears on the Bute Mazer, where Gules, three cinquefoils ermine, presumably for Walter fitzGilbert, is accompanied by Gules, a chevron ermine between three cinquefoils for brother John (d 1328). On the basis of these arms, it has been customary to trace the Hamilton origins to Robert fitzPernel, Earl of Leicester (d1204), who bore a single cinquefoil ermine to the Hamiltons' three. However, no genealogical evidence supports this assumption and a more sensible proposition is that they were kin, or vassals of the Umfraville lords of Redesdale and the earls of Angus (1247-1321) and took their name from Hameldon in Northumberland. Indeed, it is stated that a Walter fitzGilbert married Emma de Umfraville in the 13th century and of course other client Umfraville families like Swinburne and Clenell likewise bore the cinquefoils.\\" McAndrew also cites the work of J. Bain's, \\"Walter fitz Gilbert, ancestor of the Dukes of Hamilton,\\" who further suggested that \\"Walter de Burghdon (Boroudoun), whose earlier seal attached to the Ragman Roll display a single cinquefoil and whose later seals display three cinquefoils, was identical with Walter fitzGilbert of Hameldone. Bain, of course, was not aware of the painted heraldric evidence that demonstrated that Walter de Burghdon (d1309) bore Argent, three cinquefoils sable when fighting in the Scottish Wars and his relative Gilbert de Burradoun bore Gules, on a bend argent, three cinquefoils sable in the Parliamentary Roll\\" Documentary evidence Walter fitz Gilbert first appears as a witness to a charter of James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland granting land to the monks of Paisley Abbey in 1294, and also later in the year in another granting land to the same establishment. The other signatories were all minor landowners in Renfrewshire.Maxwell, p340 Fitz Gilbert was present at Berwick Castle to sign the Ragman Roll, alongside the majority of other Scots Nobility, at the behest of Edward I of England. He is styled on that document as \\"Wauter fiz Gilbert de Hameldone\\". The arms of fitz Gilbert are represented on the Bute mazer, a drinking cup exhibited in the National Museum of Scotland, that been dated to soon after Bannockburn, and was possibly commissioned by him. The National Museum of Scotland suggest that Walter fitz Gilbert may have been the brother of John fitz Gilbert probable Baillie of Bute. Wars of Scottish Independence During the risings of William Wallace, and later Robert the Bruce, Walter fitz Gilbert remained loyal to the English party, holding lands in Fife of King Edward.Maxwell p341 By 1314 he was constable of Bothwell Castle in South Lanarkshire and was charged by Edward with its security: :\\"The king commands Walter fitz Gilbert, constable of his castle of Bothwell to see that it is safely and securely kept, and delivered to no other person whatsoever, without the king‚Äôs letters patent under the Great Seal of England directed to himself\\" Following the defeat of Edward II of England at the Battle of Bannockburn, a sizable party of English noblemen under the Earl of Hertford fled to Bothwell Castle. The party included Robert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, Maurice, Lord of Berkleley, John, Lord of Segrave, and Anthony de Lacy. Walter fitz Gilbert admitted Hereford and his party. Once inside, he made them all prisoners and went over to the Scots. Later life Joining the Bruce party, Walter fitz Gilbert was granted lands of Dalserf, previously owned by the Comyn faction, and was later rewarded with the barony of Cadzow and Cadzow Castle on the banks of the Clyde. He was a Justice of Lanark in 1321, and was knighted the following year. In 1323 he was granted the lands of Kinneil, Larbert and Auldcathy in present-day West Lothian, and Kirkcowan in Wigtownshire.Maxwell, p341 Walter fitz Gilbert was present at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, fighting in the division of the High Steward, (later Robert II of Scotland), but is thought to have escaped the carnage there. There is little else heard of him. He died prior to 1346, when his son David fought at the Battle of Neville's Cross as Laird of Cadzow.Maxwell, p342 Marriage and issue Walter fitz Gilbert married Mary Gordon, daughter of Sir Adam Gordon of that Ilk, ancestor of the Earls of Huntly. By her he had two sons: *David fitz Walter of Cadzow, ancestor of the Dukes of Hamilton and Dukes of Abercorn *John fitz Walter, ancestor of the Earls of Haddington and the Hamiltons of Innerwick Notes Sources *Balfour Paul, Sir James, The Scots Peerage Vol IV.

In 1951‚Äì2, the Havel Canal was constructed through the municipality to link Hennigsdorf with Paretz, thus avoiding a passage through the reach of the River Havel, between Spandau and Potsdam, that was under the political control of West Berlin. The single lock on the canal is located at Sch√∂nwalde. The canal is still in use, providing a shorter route for shipping from west of Berlin to the Oder‚ÄìHavel Canal and Poland.

Clubhouse of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club, as it appeared in the 1890s. Photo by John S. Johnston. The Indian Harbor Yacht Club is a U.S. boating organization, based at 710 Steamboat Road in Greenwich, CT, with access to Long Island Sound. The club, founded in 1889 in New York City, is based mainly around personally owned yachts and pleasure boats, but also has a long history of competitive races. The New York Times noted that \\"Indian Harbor ranks among the most influential institutions of its kind in the country.\\" History On July 1, 1889, under the leadership of Frank Bowne Jones, Richard Outwater, Henry S. Doremus, Charles J. Hart and others, the Indian Harbor Yacht Club came into being, rising from the ashes of the old Greenwich Yacht Club. The particular business was originally stated as, \\"Shall be to encourage and support the sport of yachting, the art of yacht designing and building, and the science of seamanship and navigation.\\" Later, when incorporated, the following words were added: \\"and to provide for the amusement and recreation of its members.\\" This was primarily a sailing club and Henry E. Doremus was the first Commodore, William Ross Proctor the Vice Commodore, and Charles J. Hart the Rear Commodore. The club's first headquarters were in New York, and in 1892 it leased Finch's Island in Greenwich as its sailing base. The present property was developed in 1895 by Commodore Charles T. Wills, and the clubhouse dates to 1921. It is an unusual example of Mediterranean Revival design, by architect Henry Pelton, then a member of the club's race committee. Indian Harbor Yacht Club has recorded more entries in the Newport Bermuda Race than any other yacht club in the world. Indian Harbor members were part of the crew of the Intrepid during its America's Cup victories in 1967 and 1970. In 1989, as part of the Club's centennial celebrations, Indian Harbor Yacht Club published 'A Century of sailing : the first one hundred years of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club, 1889-1989' 'A Century of sailing: the first one hundred years of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club, 1889-1989' (Greenwich, Conn. : Indian Harbor Yacht Club, 1989) The club's facilities on Steamboat Road were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. The designation was in recognition of the club's importance in the realm of racing and yachting, as well as for the architecture of its clubhouse. The club is a founding member of the National Sailing Hall of Fame.

The first issue was published in 1956. History The founder of Bravo was columnist Peter Boenisch. The first issue was published on 26 August 1956 with thirty thousand copies printed, cost 50 Pfennig (equivalent to ‚Ç¨ in ). Marilyn Monroe's portrait graced the first published issue; the never-published dummy issue cover displayed Elvis Presley. The publication was initially subtitled as \\"the magazine for film and television\\" (). Issue number 13/57 was released on 31 March 1957 with the new subtitle \\"the magazine with the young heart\\" () as well as \\"film, television, pop music\\" () which disappeared soon afterwards. Starting from issue 34/57 (13 August 1957) the magazine no longer had any subtitles underscoring its newfound focus. In 1968 Bravo began to be published weekly by Pabel Moewig, a subsidiary of Bauer Verlagsgruppe in Hamburg; the editorial office however remained in Munich. In the 1970s the magazine sold more than one million copies. By 1996 each issue still sold around 1.4 million issues.M√§rkische Oderzeitung - Journal, 26./27. August 2006, S. 4 Bravo had a circulation of 825,800 copies in 1999. Afterwards the circulation fell steeply. In 2006 the magazine sold around 460,379 copies.Heinrich Bauer Verlag: BRAVO In 2010 the circulation of the magazine was 512,358 copies, making it the best-selling teenager magazine in Europe. In February 2017, Bravo stopped publishing in Spain with issue 552. However, editions are still published in some other countries. American pop singer Britney Spears, who was a teen phenomenon in the late 90s and early 00s, holds the record for most appearances on the cover (56). Focus group and classic columns Bravo covers topics which primarily interest youths, among which are current information on pop and movie stars, as well as relationship and sex counseling. Under the pseudonyms \\"Dr. Christoph Vollmer\\" and \\"Dr. Kirsten Lindstroem\\" the then-47-year-old author of romance novels Marie Louise Fischer gave advice on relationships (Knigge f√ºr Verliebte, Liebe ohne Geheimnis) from 1964 to 1969. Martin Goldstein started to contribute to the magazine on 20 October 1969.), a practising doctor, psychotherapist, and religion teacher, he took over and replied to readers' questions under the pseudonym \\"Dr. Jochen Sommer\\". Goldstein had made a name for himself in sex education with the publications Anders als bei Schmetterlingen and Lexikon der Aufkl√§rung. Later, he answered questions about sex as \\"Dr. Korff\\", while \\"Dr. Sommer\\" concentrated on psychological questions. From the early 1970s on, a whole group replied to questions. The editors put value in the fact that the \\"Dr.-Sommer-Team\\" continued to be made up of experts. At its peak Bravo received around 3000 to 5000 letters on puberty and sexuality per week. In 2006, 400 letters were still received. Bravo made noticeably strong use of Anglicism and \\"Denglisch\\" starting in the 1980s, long before this became a mainstream phenomenon. Bravo was ‚Äì primarily in the 1970s and 1980s ‚Äì formative for generations of German youths and teenagers,Pop 2000 (ARD), episode 4 1968-1970: Sex & Drugs & Rebellion. which resulted in the paper's nickname of (pimple-Pravda). The magazine was sometimes confiscated in schools by teachers. Many of today's adults received all of their sexual education from the articles by the Dr. Sommer team.Pop 2000 (ARD), episode 8 1982-1985: Gib Gas, ich will Spa√ü.Love, Sex and Tenderness: Dr. Sommer, the Birds and the Bees Der Spiegel. Within the former GDR (East Germany) the magazine was forbidden, but still very popular and traded for high prices. Bravo played an influential part in promoting pop groups and artists in Germany. In addition to the idea of the Dr.-Sommer-team, Bravo invented the so-called Bravo- Starschnitt (star cut), a puzzle of a life-sized poster of a celebrity. Every new issue provided one cutout piece. The first Starschnitt-feature began in 1959 and was a poster of Brigitte Bardot. Controversies Sexual content In 1972, two issues with articles on masturbation were indexed (prohibited for sale to under-age customers) because they were deemed youth- endangering. Depictions of child nudity The magazine is controversial abroad for its section That's Me!, which often features sex interviews and full frontal nude photos of teen models from age 14 (although the age has been raised to 16)Models f√ºr Aufkl√§rungsproduktion Nesh. Retrieved 2 April 2015. which while legal in Germany, can cause problems with international child pornography laws. The magazine often works around these laws by having the models hold the camera's shutter button themselves, thereby showing explicit consent. One former model told interviewers that he did not know his nude image was going to be sold by the photographer to Bravo for publication in That's Me! A Dutch magazine called Break Out! was modelled on Bravo. The editor of Break Out! described Bravo as \\"quite a nasty magazine. Once they even had a minor posing nude.\\" He admitted that most of the teens who posed for the Dutch equivalent of That's Me! were poor Polish and Romanian prostitutes. \\"The origin of the models was a best-kept secret. We didn't talk about it, we'd never even mentioned it. And you know, everybody benefited. We needed nude children and they needed the easy money.\\" He admitted that the interviews accompanying the photographs were also fake.  Present  Originally there was only a single Bravo magazine, today different variants are published. This is a result of higher individualisation and changing interests. The following brands are part of the \\"Bravo Family\\": * Bravo.de (Internet portal for teenagers independent of the magazine) * Bravo Girl (targeting girls) * Bravo Screenfun (for video games and consoles) * Bravo Sport (sport magazine) * Bravo Sport TV (sport TV show) * Bravo TV (youth television magazine) * Bravo Hits (regularly published music compilation album) * Bravo Hip Hop Special (published six times a year, focusing on Hip- Hop, R'n'B, and Rap) Teenage magazines like Bravo are of high importance for the music industry as an advertising medium. Ads can be found in all Bravo formats. A TV version of Bravo called Bravo TV started airing on 16 May 1993, first on RTL 2 and later on ZDF. The first presenter was Kristiane Backer, followed by Heike Makatsch. After a long hiatus Bravo TV returned on 5 November 2005 on ProSieben. The magazine distributes its \\"Bravo Otto\\" (a small Indian-styled figure) award in different categories. The design of the figure is inspired by Winnetou, played by Pierre Brice, who had a longstanding connection within his cinematic role to Bravo. Among the prized artists were pop super stars ABBA, Inge Meysel, Pierre Brice (Winnetou), Joachim Fuchsberger, Stefan Raab, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Cher, David Hasselhoff, Mariah Carey, Boris Becker, Bro'Sis, Heike Makatsch, Horst Janson and many more. Furthermore, each week the readers vote in the Bravo charts, which sometimes oppose the sales charts and are an indicator of artists popularity in the past and today. In 2006 Bravo released an anthology providing an overview of Bravo's perception of the world within the past 50 years.

It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way. Consumer debt counseling and management services have been available to individuals with serious credit problems going back to the 1950s. There are generally two kinds of services that have been available. Some of these services have provided counseling coupled with assisting debtors in establishing programs to pay off debts over an extended time. Others have provided consolidation and management services, in which agreements are reached with creditors to settle on a percentage of debt. Most of these services have collected a periodic amount from the debtors from which payment to creditors has been made. The general objective of these services has been debt satisfaction without resort to bankruptcy. The history of debt counseling and management services is checkered. There have been numerous abuses and efforts to counter abuses statutorily in many states. These services have been criticized for their efforts to steer debtors away from bankruptcy when it may have been more advantageous and less costly to debtors to file. Many states prohibit for-profit debt management services while permitting nonprofit debt counseling services. One of the continuing controversies is whether for profit services should be allowed even if regulated. However, federal bankruptcy reform effective in 2005 has changed the perspective on such services. For an individual to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, that individual will in most cases have to show that consumer debt counseling/management has been sought and attempted. This shifts a highly significant burden upon private services to perform honestly and effectively. Because the new bankruptcy rules are federal and apply in every state, regulating the counseling and management services in every state must be uniform in character for the new bankruptcy rules to be effective and for consumers to be protected. In 2005, just in time for consideration in the state legislatures, the Uniform Law Commissioners promulgated the Uniform Debt-Management Services Act (UDMSA). It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing these services that will mean national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way. In March 2008, several important amendments were made to the UDMSA. With these amendments, more than 20 states are executed to introduce the act in 2009. UDMSA may be divided into three basic parts: registration of services, service-debtor agreements and enforcement. Each part contributes to the comprehensive quality of the Uniform Act. Registration No service may enter into an agreement with any debtor in a state without registering as a consumer debt-management service in that state. Registration requires submission of detailed information concerning the service, including its financial condition, the identity of principals, locations at which service will be offered, form for agreements with debtors and business history in other jurisdictions. To register, a service must have an effective insurance policy against fraud, dishonesty, theft and the like in an amount no less than $250,000.00. It must also provide a security bond of a minimum of $50,000.00 which has the state administrator as a beneficiary. If a registration substantially duplicates one in another state, the service may offer proof of registration in that other state to satisfy the registration requirements in a state. A satisfactory application will result in a certificate to do business from the administrator. A yearly renewal is required. Agreements In order to enter into agreements with debtors, there is a disclosure requirement respecting fees and services to be offered, and the risks and benefits of entering into such a contract. The service must offer counseling services from a certified counselor and a plan must be created in consultation by the counselor for debt-management service to commence. The contents of the agreements and fees that may be charged are set by the statute. There is a penalty-free three-day right of rescission on the part of the debtor. The debtor may cancel the agreement also after 30 days, but may be subject to fees if that occurs. The service may terminate the agreement if required payments are delinquent for at least 60 days. Any payments for creditors received from a debtor must be kept in a trust account that may not be used to hold any other funds of the service. There are strict accounting requirements and periodic reporting requirements respecting funds held. With respect to debt settlement services, the UDMSA provides for an overall fee cap based on the amount saved by the consumer (30% of the difference between the principal amount owed upon initiation of the service and the amount the debt is ultimately settled for). Enforcement The Act prohibits specific acts on the part of a service including: misappropriation of funds in trust; settlement for more than 50% of a debt with a creditor without a debtor‚Äôs consent; gifts or premiums to enter into an agreement; and representation that settlement has occurred without certification from a creditor. Enforcement of the Uniform Act occurs at two levels, the administrator and the individual level. The administrator has investigative powers, power to order an individual to cease and desist; power to assess a civil penalty up to $10,000.00, and the power to bring a civil action. An individual may bring a civil action for compensatory damages, including triple damages if a service obtains payments not authorized in the Uniform Act, and may seek punitive damages and attorney‚Äôs fees. A service has a good faith mistake defense against liability. The statute of limitations pertaining to an action by the administrator is four years, and two years for a private right of action. Banks as regulated entities under other law are not subject to the Uniform Act, as are other kinds of activities that are incidental to other functions performed. For example, a title insurer that provides bill-paying service that is incidental to title insurance is not subject to it. UDMSA provides comprehensive regulation of debt counseling and management services. It becomes an essential part of the law of creditor and debtor as bankruptcy reform enacted by Congress in 2005 takes effect.  UDMSA & Debt Settlement Trade Associations  Due to the rise of debt settlement as a debt relief alternative to bankruptcy, groups working in the industry established trade associations to help secure industry standards that will protect consumers against unethical business practices. These trade associations were also established to lobby state governments to adopt the recommendations of the UDMSA. The two major trade associations are the United States Organization for Bankruptcy Alternatives (USOBA) , and The Association of Settlement Companies (TASC) . These organizations publish on their websites information about the UDMSA, debt settlement and the debt settlement industry.

His work in solitary as a vanguardist painter frames the beginnings of modern art in Colombia. Santa Maria's search for new artistic expressions generated rejection and controversies around his work. He lived a great part of his life in Europe.  Early life Andr√©s de Santa Maria Hurtado was born in Bogot√°, Colombia on December 16, 1860. He was the third son of Andr√©s de Santa Maria Rovira and Manuela Hurtado. He belonged to a well off family that was politically connected. Both his grandfather and his father worked for several years in high official positions for the Colombian government. In 1862, when he was two years old, his parents took him to Europe. The family lived in London until 1869 when they moved to Brussels. In 1878, his father obtained a position at the Colombian Embassy in France and his family settled in Paris. Santa Maria's desire to be a painter faced the strong opposition of his parents who forced him to follow a career in finances. For a time, he worked as a banker, but at the death of his father in 1882, he was finally able to study painting.\\"Andr√©s de Santa Maria\\": Martinez Betancour, William, He entered the School of Art in Paris and worked in the workshops of Ferdinand Jacques Humbert (1842‚Äì1881) and Henri Gervex (1852‚Äì1929). Prince Eugen of Sweden and the Spanish painter, Ignacio Zuloaga y Zabaleta, studied with him under Gervex's guidance.\\"Andr√©s de Santa Maria\\": Villegas Editores The impressionist art movement had a great influence on his career, but Santa Maria was also interested in social subjects shown in the work of Alfred Roll and through him, he was influenced by the realism movement and the paintings of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and Gustave Courbet. Santa Maria first obtained recognition when he won a first prize and was accepted to participate in the salon of French Artists in 1887 with his painting Launderers of the Seine. This large and ambitious painting already shows impressionist elements in the use of the reflection of light and his interest in social subjects. He took part in the salons of 1888, 1889 and 1890. In this early period, Santa Maria painted a variety of works with a refined liking for realism in the style of Courbet in works as: The shooters (1885), The reading (1886) and Salom√≥n F. Koppel (1889). These paintings also show Santa Maria's clear command of the rules of the academy. In 1891, he exhibited his painting: The tea party, at the Artistic union of Paris. The tea party is one of the best works of his early period that concludes when he left Europe to go back to Colombia.  Colombia  Andr√©s de Santa Maria married Amalia Bidwell Hurtado on January 25, 1893, in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. They had eight children. In 1894, the couple decided to come back to Colombia, where they lived for almost two decades. Shortly after arriving at Bogot√°, Santa Maria was appointed professor of landscape at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (English: The National Academy of Fine Arts), where he brought the experience he had learned in France. However, his work as a vanguardist artist breaking with the traditional academic painting in Colombia was controversial. During the Colombian Civil War called, the Thousand Days War, the Academy was closed and Santa Maria made a long trip to Europe. In Paris, he took part in the French salon with his painting los dragoniantes de la guardian inglesa, which received a congratulation letter from the jurors. At the end of the Thousand Days War, he came back to Colombia, where in 1904, he was appointed director of the Academy of Arts, a position he held for the rest of the years he lived in his native country (until 1911). He was invited by the president of the republic, general Rafael Reyes, to perform an exhibition with the writers San√≠n Cano, Hinestroza Daza and Max Grillo. In 1906 he painted the triptych of the National Capital, in this represented Simon Bolivar directing the liberation campaign. While in charge of the Academy, he also founded the school of decorative and industrial arts, in which other artistic techniques like pottery, wood and stone carving and smelting were taught. In 1910, he organized an exhibition commemorating the centenary of the Independence of Colombia in which he exhibited forty-six of his works . As an artist, Santa Maria did not enjoy great recognition and his work as director of the academy was controversial. Under a cloud of criticism, he decided to resign to his post and left Colombia to never return. On finishing his work as director of the School of Beautiful Arts, he returned again to Europe and settled in Brussels.  Later life  Santa Maria left for Europe in 1911. With his family, he traveled to England, the Netherlands and France before settling in Brussels. At the outbreak of World War I, he moved to Paris where he established a friendship with the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. During the war he traveled to London; he finally settled in San Sebastian, where he remained until 1918. At the end of the war, he came back to Brussels. During this, the third period of his career, he earned distinctions as a painter in exhibitions in 1936 in Brussels and in 1937 in London (Burlington Gallery, displaying 125 paintings made over a 30-year period from 1907). He captured the modern tendencies of the European art, but was inspired by the great master like el Greco. Until the last years of his life, Santa Maria remained active and held many exhibitions of his works. Andr√©s de Santamaria died on April 29, 1945, of kidney infection. He was eighty-five years old. After his death, there have been many exhibitions of his works, most notably at the Colombian National Museum in 1949 and the Museo de Arte Moderno de Bogot√° in 1971, when 126 of his paintings were exhibited.  Style and legacy  His paintings can be divided into three different periods of evolution. In his early works, executed while living in France, light and color have great importance. His second period began with his return to Colombia. It is characterized by a style within the divisionism, a method of painting that uses pure color, harmony and contrast. His last period began when he was back in Europe. He used a richer pictorial language, employing knives and spatulas to apply thick layers of paint. The forms became denser and more vibrant. Santa Maria's work was in essence, impressionist in character and his work influenced modern painting in Colombia. Sometimes, this impressionism however would take passage to postimpressionist and other influences. He influenced the work of later artists such as F√≠dolo Alfonso Gonz√°lez Camargo and Roberto P√°ramo. In Latin America, one can draw parallels of his work with the Venezuelan Armando Rever√≥n and the Uruguayan Pedro Figari. The greatest collection of his works amounting to some 30 oil paintings is conserved by the National Museum of Colombia in Bogota. The museum owns emblematic pieces such as \\"En la Playa de Macuto\\" (Ca. 1907). His other works are in museums such as Colecci√≥n de Arte del Banco de la Rep√∫blica, the Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango, Museo de Arte Moderno de Bogot√° and the Museo de Antioquia in Medell√≠n, Antioquia.

She established nursing training programs in the United States and Japan, and created the first system for keeping individual medical records for hospitalized patients.Linda Richards (1915) Reminiscences of Linda Richards, Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston Early life Richards was born Malinda Ann Judson Richards on July 27, 1841, in West Potsdam, New York. She was the youngest of three daughters of Betsy Sinclair Richards and Sanford Richards, a preacher, who named his daughter after the missionary Ann Hasseltine Judson in the hopes that she would follow in her footsteps. In 1845, Richards moved with her family to Wisconsin, where they owned some land. However, her father died of tuberculosis just weeks after they arrived there, and the family soon had to return to Richards' grandparents' home in Newbury, Vermont. They purchased a small farm just outside the town and settled there. Betsy Sinclair Richards also contracted tuberculosis, and Linda Richards nursed her mother until her death from the disease in 1854. Education Her experience with nursing her dying mother awakened Richards' interest in nursing. Though in 1856, at the age of fifteen, Richards entered St. Johnsbury Academy for a year in order to become a teacher, and indeed taught for several years, she was never truly happy in that profession.Bio of Linda Richards accessed December 6, 2007 In 1860, Richards met George Poole, to whom she became engaged. Not long after their engagement, Poole joined the Green Mountain Boys and left home to fight in the American Civil War. He was severely wounded in 1865, and when he returned home, Richards cared for him until his death in 1869.Linda Richards Biography Inspired by these personal losses, she moved to Boston, Massachusetts in order to become a nurse. Her first job was at Boston City Hospital, where she received almost no training and was subjected to overwork. She left that hospital after only three months but was undaunted by her experiences there. In 1872, Linda Richards became the first student to enroll in the inaugural class of five nurses in the first American Nurse‚Äôs training school. This pioneering school was run by Dr. Susan Dimock, at the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston. Linda describes her nursing training: ‚ÄúWe rose at 5.30 a.m. and left the wards at 9 p.m. to go to our beds, which were in little rooms between the wards. Each nurse took care of her ward of six patients both day and night. Many a time I got up nine times in the night; often I did not get to sleep before the next call came. We had no evenings out, and no hours for study or recreation. Every second week we were off duty one afternoon from two to five o'clock. No monthly allowance was given for three months.‚Äù Career Upon graduating one year later, she moved to New York City, where she was hired as a night supervisor at Bellevue Hospital Center. While working there, she created a system for keeping individual records for each patient, which was to be widely adopted both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Aware of how little she still knew as a nurse, Linda began her quest to acquire more knowledge and then pass this on to others by establishing high quality nurse training schools. Returning to Boston in 1874, she was named superintendent of the Boston Training School for nurses. Though the school's training program was only a year old at the time, it was under threat of closure due to poor management. Richards, however, improved the program to such an extent that it was soon regarded as one of the best of its kind in the country. In an effort to upgrade her skills, Richards took an intensive, seven-month nurse training program in England in 1877. She trained under Florence Nightingale (who set up a training school for nurses) and was a resident visitor at St Thomas' Hospital and King's College Hospital in London, and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. On her return to the United States with Nightingale‚Äôs warmest wishes, Richards pioneered the founding and superintending of nursing training schools across the nation. Linda Richards in Japan In 1885 she helped to establish Japan's first nurses-training program. She supervised the school at the Doshisha Hospital in Kyoto for five years. When she returned to the United States in 1890, she worked as a nurse for another twenty years while helping to establish special institutions for those with mental illnesses. She was elected as the first president of the American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools, and served as head of the Philadelphia Visiting Nurses Society. She retired from nursing in 1911, at the age of seventy. She wrote a book about her experiences, Reminiscences of Linda Richards (1911) which has been republished in 2006 as America's First Trained Nurse. Diggory Press, Richards suffered a severe stroke in 1923, and was hospitalized until her death on April 16, 1930. Richards was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1994. She is mentioned in connection with Mass. General Hospital on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

The 86th AW is stationed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The wing's primary mission is to conduct airlift, airdrop and aeromedical evacuation operations flying the C-21A, C-20H, C-37A, C-40B and C-130J aircraft. The 86th Airlift Wing commander also serves as the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC) commander, leading the largest American community outside the United States. Originally the 86th Fighter Wing was established and activated on 1 July 1948 at Neubiberg AB, Germany. History The 86th Fighter Wing was established and activated on 1 July 1948 at Neubiberg AB, Germany. Its initial mission was to provide air defense, primarily in West Germany with its operational component, the 86th Fighter Group. F-47D's of the 526th Fighter Squadron at Neubiberg Air Base Equipped with P (later F-47) Thunderbolts, the 86th was one of two active USAF fighter units in Germany (the other being the 36th FG) during the immediate postwar years. Over the next several years, the 86th underwent several redesignations and several station assignments in occupied Germany. In June 1948, the 86th Fighter Wing was stationed at Neubiberg Air Base, near Munich when tensions with the Soviet Union culminated in the Berlin Blockade. With the arrival of the jet age in Europe, USAFE wanted to move its units west of the Rhine River, as its bases in the Munich area were just a few minutes flying time from Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 bases in Czechoslovakia. In February 1951, the United States and France signed an agreement in which USAF bases in their German occupation zone would be built and made available to USAFE. In late 1952, enough construction was completed at Landstuhl and the 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing was reassigned to the new base. Landstuhl AB sign, 1953 The 86th Wing (under various designations) has been assigned to Ramstein for almost 60 years, with a brief period (1966‚Äì1973) being inactive or assigned to Zweibr√ºcken Air Base. In March 1958 the 86th Fighter-Bomber Group was inactivated and its operational squadrons were assigned to the Wing. In May, the 406th FIW at RAF Manston, England was inactivated. Its three F-86D squadrons, the 512th, 513th and 514th were reassigned to bases on the continent and were also assigned to the 86th. These squadrons were detached to the following bases: * 512th FIS to Sembach Air Base, Germany * 513th FIS to Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base France * 514th FIS to Ramstein (Blue tail stripes) 86th Air Division (Defense) In January 1959 the 525th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Bitburg received its first Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, designed to upgrade the air defense capabilities of Western Europe. HQ USAFE decided to upgrade the 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and centralize command of all the European Air Defense squadrons in USAFE to it. With this change, the 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing was redesignated the 86th Air Division (Defense) on 18 November 1960. However at the time of their arrival in Europe, the F-102 was already being replaced by the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo and the Convair F-106 Delta Dart in the Aerospace Defense Command as an interceptor, and by much more versatile McDonnell F-4 Phantom II. On 14 November 1968 the 86th Air Division was inactivated.  86th Tactical Fighter Wing  86th TFW 17th TRS McDonnell Douglas RF-4C-38-MC Phantom AF Serial No. 68-0562, 1970 In 1968 the Canadian Armed Forces announced they were downsizing their forces in Europe, and Canada's three wings left Zweibr√ºcken Air Base, leaving the base available for USAFE. On 1 November 1969, the Air Force reactivated the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Zweibr√ºcken. It received its first flying unit, the 17th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, on 12 January 1970. The 17th TRS and its McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom IIs was reassigned to the 86th TFW from the inactivating 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Upper Heyford, England. Squadron tail code for the 17th TRS was initially \\"ZS\\", then was recoded to \\"ZR\\" in 1971. For 18 months the 17th was the only operational squadron on the base. On 12 June 1971, the 81st Tactical Fighter Squadron with its Electronics Counter-Measures (ECM) equipped McDonnell EF-4C Phantom II \\"Wild Weasel\\" fighters was attached to the 86th TFW from the 50th TFW at Hahn AB when the 50th switched to a strike-attack role, with air defense as a secondary mission. (Note: The EF-4C designation was not official. The aircraft were officially F-4C models). The 81st TFS, however remained a part of the 50th TFW but was detached from the wing's operational control and attached to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing for support. Squadron tail code for the 81st TFS was \\"ZS\\". McDonnell Douglas F-4E-41-MC Phantom AF Serial No. 68-0527, 86th TFW 527th TFS In 1972, tail codes for all 86th TFW aircraft at Zweibr√ºcken were standardized as \\"ZR\\", per AFM 66-1, when squadron tail codes were eliminated. However, with these reconnaissance aircraft at Zweibr√ºcken the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing's designation did not coincide with the wing's mission. The name issue was resolved as part of a USAFE command-wide effort to realign functions and streamline operations called Creek Action. On 15 January 1973, the 81st TFS was reassigned to Spangdahlem Air Base under operation \\"Battle Creek\\". The last of this variant of the Phantom returned to the US in 1979/1980 and was replaced by the F-4G Wild Weasel at Spangdahlem. In addition, USAFE transferred the 26 TRW from Ramstein to Zweibr√ºcken Air Base, Germany, and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) from Zweibr√ºcken back to Ramstein on 31 January 1973. These moves were made without the transfer of personnel or equipment with the exception of the 38 TRS, 7 SOS and 81 TFS. The 38th remained under the control of the 26 TRW by moving to Zweibr√ºcken with the wing and the 7th Special Operations Squadron was transferred to Rhein-Main Air Base. The 526th TFS remained at Ramstein AB, and it was reassigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying F-4Es. Its tail code was \\"RS\\". On 22 September 1977 the newly activated 512th TFS was equipped with the 526 TFS aircraft and the 526 TFS received new planes from McDonnell Douglas St. Louis plant. The unit was designated the 86th Tactical Fighter Group and was under the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing. With these changes, the operational squadrons of the 86th TFW in 1978 were: * 512th Tactical Fighter Squadron (F-4E, RS, yellow/black tail stripe) * 526th Tactical Fighter Squadron (F-4E, RS, red/black tail stripe) 86th TFW General Dynamics F-16C Block 30F Fighting Falcon AF Serial No. 87-0242 As the wing approached its fortieth year of service in Germany, the first F-16C Fighting Falcon arrived on 20 September 1985 and the 512th TFS converted to the General Dynamics Block 25 F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the 526th retired their F-4Es in June 1986, also receiving Block 25 F-16s. The 86th TFW supported numerous military units located in the area and participated in numerous exercises that provided the wing with air combat tactics training essential to their mission. With the rest of the world, the members of the 86th watched the Communist Bloc countries of Eastern Europe with fascination as the events of the late 1989 unfolded. When the Berlin Wall finally began to come down on 9 November 1989 and the celebrations began, many members of the Ramstein community and 86th TFW went to Berlin to see the events and take pieces of the Wall. The 86th TFW and Ramstein had just begun to absorb the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War when, in August 1990, the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Under Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, much to the dismay of the 86th TFW personnel, their F-16s did not deploy to the Persian Gulf like so many of its USAFE counterparts. Instead, Ramstein became an intermediate support base for American forces deployed to the Persian Gulf and, on 10 August 1990, Ramstein began receiving MAC stage crews as the base became an overflow airfield for Rhein-Main AB, supporting strategic airlift traffic to the Persian Gulf. 512th Tactical Fighter Squadron ‚Äì F-16 84‚Äì239 1986 In addition to serving as a central overflow hub for airlift traffic flying between the US and the Arabian Peninsula, Ramstein also established an intermediate engine repair facility for deployed F-16s, became a huge collection and distribution center for gulf- bound munitions, and on 15 January 1991, Ramstein AB's aeromedical staging facility activated a 150-bed hospital and blood transshipment center in Hangar 1. The hospital provided triage to its first patients from the Persian Gulf on the same day. Additionally, personnel from virtually every squadron augmented Air Force and Army units deployed to the gulf. With the end of Operation Desert Storm, the 86th TFW deployed to Turkey and supported operations in Southwest Asia to ensure that Iraq complied with treaty terms. From 6 April 1991, when the operation began, until September 1993 when its commitment ended, the wing flew nearly 5,000 sorties over Iraq. 526th TFS aircraft twice attacked Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites in northern Iraq. For its participation in Provide Comfort, the 86th TFW received credit in a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, though the award did little to placate the wing personnel who felt they had \\"missed\\" the war. On 1 May 1991, the 86th TFW was redesigned the 86th Fighter Wing and underwent a complete change in its organizational structure as a test base for the USAFE Corona South wing reorganization program, an effort to \\"flatten\\" command lines and consolidate span of control. Ramstein's 316th Air Division and 377th Combat Support Wing were inactivated and all of their former functions placed under the operational control of the 86th Fighter Wing. The lessons learned at Ramstein applied to other units Air Force-wide as they converted to the new organizational structure. Conversion to an airlift wing Lockheed C-130E Hercules of the 37th AS/86th Airlift Wing The end of the Cold War brought major force structure changes throughout the Air Force, and the 86th was no exception. On 1 June 1992, the 86th Fighter Wing, which had only been equipped with F-16s, began a slow move to airlift operations when the wing took over the 58th Airlift Squadron and its small executive fleet of C-12, C-20 Gulfstream, C-21 Lear Jet, CT-43 Bobcat, C-135, and UH-1 aircraft. After gaining this airlift mission, the wing changed its designation from the 86th Fighter Wing to the 86th Wing. In 1994 the decision was made to change the 86th Wing from a composite wing to a wing devoted to intra-theater airlift, and the 86th Wing began to assume the airlift mission previously held by C-130 Hercules aircraft at the 435th Airlift Wing at Rhein Main Air Base, Germany, which was slated for inactivation. With the influx of C-130 personnel, On 1 July, the 526th FS inactivated and its aircraft and personnel moved to Aviano Air Base, Italy to form the 555th FS. President Clinton signing the 86 AW Wing emblem. The 512th FS was inactivated on 1 October, with its aircraft and personnel also being moved to Aviano, being assigned to the 510th FS. On 21 July 1994 the 86th Wing held a \\"Fighter Farewell\\" ceremony for the departure of its last F 16s, most to the 31st FW at Aviano AB, and the 86th Wing became the 86th Airlift Wing. The new wing operated C-130 Hercules aircraft. On 2 November 2009 the wing completed its transition from C-130E to C-130J models.Svan, Jennifer H., \\"Ramstein sends off last C-130E\\", Stars and Stripes, 3 November 2009. The new 86th Airlift Wing was responsible for United States Air Forces, Europe (USAFE) intra-theater airlift throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East, as well as supporting operations and exercises throughout the European theater. The reoriented wing's successful transition from F-16s to C-130s and its airlift support of numerous European contingencies earned it the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the period of 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1995, bringing the wing's total Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards to six. 86th Contingency Response Group By 1999, the new security environment in the Balkans showed the USAF the need for a rapid-deployment \\"first-in\\" force to secure a contingency airfield, then establish and maintain the airfield, aerial port operations, and provide force protection. In response to this need, the Air Force activated its first contingency response group, the 86th Contingency Response Group on 26 February 1999, as part of the 86th AW. The 86th CRG had two subordinate units‚Äîthe 86th Air Mobility Squadron and 786th Security Forces Squadron ‚Äì and incorporated more than 30 different jobs. This new, self-contained unit became the Air Force standard for such units, and proved its utility during the Kosovo conflict. On 5 May 1999, US president William Clinton, accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Henry Shelton and a large assortment of congressional delegates visited the 86th AW and Ramstein AB. During his visit, the president confirmed the 86th AW's informal motto, \\"The World's Greatest Airlift Wing.\\" Air Expeditionary Forces 86th AW Personnel Supporting Provide Hope On 1 January 2000, the Air Force introduced the concept of Air Expeditionary Forces, quickly known as AEFs, to respond to the increasing number of contingencies that call for worldwide deployments and to balance the burdens (and opportunities) for such deployments. The AEF concept attempted to provide some measure of \\"predictability,\\" by putting Airmen either on call for deployment or actually deployed for 90 days every 15 months. The concept was intended to let all personnel know the dates of their 90-day deployment period well in advance so they could be prepared. The remaining 12 months of the 15-month AEF cycle was to be spent performing routine activities: training, participating in exercises, working on civilian or military education and spending time with their families. The Balkans and Africa were much of the operational focus of the 86th AW in 2000. From March through April 2000, the 86th AW sent seven 37th AS C-130s and crews to Hoedspruit Airfield, Limpopo, South Africa in support of Joint Task Force Atlas Response, a relief effort in southern Mozambique and South Africa following torrential rains and flooding. The 37th flew more than 170 sorties, transporting over 600,000 pounds of cargo and 1,096 passengers. During Atlas Response, a new capability was provided by a 37th AS C-130E, serial number 68-0938, the first USAF C-130 to undergo Keen Sage camera system modification. The Keen Sage system was mounted in a metal- encased sphere, slightly larger than a basketball, housing three sophisticated video-capture lenses‚Äîa daylight television, a 955mm fixed focal length zoom and infrared in six fields‚Äîmounted on a pallet and strapped down in the cargo hold of the Hercules. Controlled by two operators in the aircraft, the lenses scan full circle and along 90 degrees of elevation and the airborne camera operators can beam live analog video and digitally-captured still images back to a ground station, where it could be recorded and sent to relief organizations and other users. Atlas Response was the first operational deployment of a C-130 with the Keen Sage camera system, and the 37th C-130 flew 39 sorties using this new capability to search for displaced refugees so they could be provided humanitarian assistance. Eventually the wing received eight Keen Sage configured aircraft. At the same time, members of the 86th Medical Group deployed to the nation of Cameroon for exercise MEDFLAG/Brilliant Lion. 120 doctors and medical technicians administered 20,000 immunizations and performed more than 70 surgeries, as well as delivering and distributing over 50,000 pounds of medical supplies. In August 2001, the 86th Contingency Response Group deployed to Africa as part of Operation Focus Relief, the movement and support of UN-mandated peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone. Beginning on 17 August 2000, the 86th Wing moved a large contingent of American soldiers to a staging base in Skopje, Macedonia, then on to Kosovo as part of NATO's Immediate Ready Force. By 31 December 2000, the 86th AW, with support from deployed C-130 units, transported 5,000 tons of cargo and 30,604 personnel to support US forces in Kosovo. In addition to the wing's \\"on call\\" status to support any European crisis, the wing positioned aircraft and medical personnel at emergency landing fields in Spain, Morocco and Banjul for every National Air and Space Administration (NASA) Space Shuttle launch, as well as flying missions for the On-Site Inspection Agency as part of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. May 2000 was a banner month for the 86th. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mike Ryan presented the 86th Airlift Wing with the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon for its actions from 1 September 1997, to 31 August 1999. Additionally, the 86th's C-130 squadron, the 37th Airlift Squadron \\"Bluetail Flies,\\" won the 2000 USAFE Best Airlift Tanker Squadron award. Global War on Terrorism On 16 October 2002, President Bush signed the newly passed Congressional Resolution for \\"Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq,\\" beginning Operation Iraqi Freedom. As soon as this occurred, the 86th Medical Group initiated planning for a 150-bed expansion of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and initiated steps to prepare building 2117 (Ramstein's South Side Fitness Center) for contingency use as an Aeromedical Staging Facility. Beginning the day after the president's announcement, the 86th Maintenance Group and the 86th Logistics Readiness Squadron Traffic Management Office configured 3.4 million pounds of supplies in just 120 hours, an operation that normally took 30 days, and began moving munitions for deployment. In November 2002, 29 members of the 86th Civil Engineering Group were deployed to Ganci Air Base, Kyrgyzstan, to prepare for possible operations in Iraq. In December, the tempo increased further. A request was sent from the Southern European Task Force requesting the 86th CRG evaluate eight airfields in northern Iraq. On 27 December, members of the Youngstown, Ohio 757th Airlift Reserve Squadron, 910th Airlift Wing, arrived to join the Selfridge, Michigan Air National Guard's 165th Airlift Squadron, and 127th AW, as part of the 86th Airlift Wing's 38th Airlift Squadron (Provisional). With the new arrivals, the combined forces of the 38th (P) Squadron was 154 personnel and four C-130 aircraft, and the unit took primary responsibility for providing airlift for forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina supporting Operation Joint Forge. On 3 January 2003, the 86th Materiel Maintenance Squadron (MMS) began moving War Readiness Materiel (WRM) for deployment. Over the next eight months, the 86th MMS shipped 8,340 tons of WRM to 13 locations in 9 countries. By August every USAFE location that supported Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom had received WRM from the 86th MMS. The 86th MMS also deployed seven members to various contingency locations to include Karshi-Khanabad, Uzbekistan, and Bagram, Afghanistan. Beginning 14 February, the 37th Airlift Squadron began using its Keen Sage equipped C-130s to conduct observation missions over Iraq in preparation for possible action. The squadron flew a total of 14 missions, most at night, covering five to 15 targets per flight. To honor this rather \\"un-airlifty\\" operation, the crews gave themselves the name of the \\"37th Airlift Reconnaissance Squadron.\\" Operation Iraqi Freedom 86 CRG \\"Opening the Base\\" Operations Beginning 11 March 2003, the 86th AW's 38th Airlift (Provisional) Squadron, flying from Constanta, Romania, flew its first Operation Iraqi Freedom mission. Initially 38th (P) Squadron flew missions with just 4 aircraft, but even as these missions began help was on the way. On 3 March, the 757th Airlift Reserve Squadron, 910th Airlift Wing, Youngstown, Ohio, and the 165th Airlift Squadron, 123rd Airlift Wing, Kentucky Air National Guard, Louisville, Kentucky, were called to active duty for one year to join 38th (P) Squadron. The units arrived from 21‚Äì27 March, and the personnel and equipment increased 38th (P) Squadron from four C-130s and 154 personnel to ten C-130s and 306 personnel. On 17 March, President Bush delivered an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein that he and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Saddam refused. On 20 March, the 86th Contingency Response Group went through the 86th Airlift Wing Deployment Control Center, Personnel Deployment Function, and Vehicle Deployment Function in less than three hours‚Äîa record time. On 20 March, the Coalition began its air assault on Baghdad. The 86th AW's effort began on 27 March 2003, when 20 members of the 86th Expeditionary Contingency Response Group departed from Aviano Air Base, Italy, and parachuted into Bashur airfield in northern Iraq, to prepare the field for airlift operations. The 86th ECRG team parachuted into Bashur with 1000 \\"sky soldiers\\" of the 173rd Airborne Brigade on the largest airborne combat insertion since 1989 Operation Just Cause in Panama. The initial cadre was followed by 200 more members from the 86th ECRG and the 86th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron. The 37th Airlift Squadron with its C-130E Hercules was soon involved, flying the first Hercules landing into the airfield at 2 pm on 7 April 2003. Processing through as many as five mobility lines at once, 593 members of the 86th AW deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom by 7 April. US casualties were evacuated to Ramstein, often by 86th AW units, the 75th Airlift Squadron and the 86th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron. By August 2003, 86th AW units had flown more than 30 medical evacuation missions back to Ramstein where, once on the ground, critical care transport teams provided acute care and managed patient transfer to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. Beginning 6 April, the 86th's 37th Airlift Squadron aircraft began deliveries to the forward base in Constanta, Romania, delivering 57 tons and 58 passengers to Constanta in just seven missions conducted over the course of a week. Over the subsequent weeks, the squadron's nineteen crews continued to fly round-the-clock operations averaging 4.5 missions per day. On 14 April, the 38th (P) began to fly stage operations from Souda Bay, Crete. Their first mission into Iraq brought US Marines into Erbil in an effort to seal off the Iraq-Syrian border. A few days later, on 17 April at Bashur, the airfield the 86th CRG had secured and opened, and the first shipment of humanitarian aid arrived destined for residents near Kirkuk, Iraq. Over 27 days of operations, the 86th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron received more than 370 fixed wing arrivals and departures, 4,200 personnel, and 21,500,000 pounds of cargo. By 22 April the last aircraft transited Bashur Airfield and four days later, on 26 April, the 86th Contingency Response Group Commander, Col Steven Weart, notified higher headquarters that Bashur Field, Iraq was now closed for air traffic. This was a unique occurrence‚Äînormally the 86th CRG turned its bases over for further operations. The closing marked the first time the 86th CRG closed a base it had opened. On 3 May 2003, the 37th Airlift Squadron and 38th AS (P) established stage operations in Constanta, Romania. Flying from Constanta to Kirkuk, Iraq, the 38th Airlift Squadron (P) flew its first mission on 3 May and its last mission on 24 May, the last time the unit would fly into Iraq in support of Iraqi Freedom. On 10 July 2003, the 38th AS (P) flew its last Operation Iraqi Freedom support mission. 2004 Reorganization At the beginning of 2004 the 86th Airlift Wing was the largest wing in the Air Force, but its sheer size raised various management issues. On 15 January 2004, as part of an arrangement intended to increase organizational efficiency based on a pattern used by several units in the states, the 86th AW was split. * The 86th AW became Ramstein Air Base's operational arm with the 86th Operations Group, the 86th Maintenance Group, 86th Air and Space Communications Group, and 86th Contingency Response Group. * The support function was taken over by the 435th Air Base Wing, which became the overall host base unit at Ramstein, with mission support, security forces, communications, civil engineering, logistics readiness and medical groups. African Mission While supporting the Global War on Terrorism in the Middle East and East Asia, much of the 86th AW's focus was on Africa, which was in the US European Command (USEUCOM) area of responsibility. On 28 February 2004, C-130s from the 37th AS joined a humanitarian effort to bring supplies to Al Hoceima Province in northern Morocco. On 13 March 2005, in a \\"rush delivery,\\" two C-130s from the 37th AS delivered more than 19 tons of humanitarian aid to Chad. The mission, which under normal circumstances would have taken several days to plan, was planned and the aircraft launched in less than an hour. On 6 June 2004, three 37th AS C-130s participated in a parachute drop with 13 other USAF airlifters to commemorate the 60th anniversary of D-Day. In a two-week operation in March 2005, the 37th AS and the 86th Contingency Support Group moved 252 tons of cargo and 357 US Army soldiers into Tibuktu, Mali, in support of the Global War on Terrorism. In August 2004, the 86th AW increased it support of the Global War on Terrorism as wing personnel began to deploy as part of the Air Expeditionary Force \\"downrange,\\" the euphuism for the Persian Gulf region or the areas in and around Afghanistan. Most of the Ramstein Airmen, especially aircrew, were deployed to Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, where they served as part of the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing. Many of their combat missions were flown into Bagdad International Airport and Balad Air Base, both in Iraq. In October 2004, two C-130s from the 37th AS deployed to Kigali, Rwanda, near the Darfur region of Sudan, government organizations in the region. During the deployment the crews transported 380 African Union troops and 3,000 tons of supplies. to provide support and security to the United Nations agencies and non-government organizations in the region. During the deployment the crews transported 380 African Union troops and 3,000 tons of supplies. In July 2005, the 86th AW deployed three C-130s from the 37th AS and about 40 personnel to Kigali, Rwanda, in support of NATO missions in Darfur, then in October returned many of the African Union troops to Rwanda. The deployment was similar to one undertaken in October 2004, and during the operation the C-130s carried the African Union troops on a thirteen-hour flight to Sudan where the African Union troops were to provide security for aid distribution operations in the area The Gateway to Europe On 10 October 2005, Rhein-Main Air Base was officially closed and Ramstein Air Base now designated \\"The Gateway to Europe.\\" Another bit of good news for Ramstein came on 9 December when, to the delight of about 3,000 soccer fans partying Kaiserslautern's Stiftsplatz, it was announced that the US national soccer team would play its first-round games in the FIFA World Cup in Kaiserslautern. It was quickly decided that the US team would be quartered at Ramstein Air Base While the 86th AW participated in numerous events in 2007, one of the most touching was a flight by one of the 38th (P) Delta Squadron's C-130s to Tripoli, Libya, which had once been home to a major American air base, Wheelus. When the United States was forced to leave, it left behind in a cemetery the remains of 72 dependents, all stillborn babies or infants. With the improving atmosphere between the governments of Libya and the United States, the 86th AW was told to proceed to the Libyan capitol, Tripoli, and recover the remains. A team led by General Johnston flew to Libya on 1 March 2007, to recover the remains, and they were returned to their families at Ramstein. During 2007, the wing added the 496th ABS, Moron AB, Spain to the 86th OG and the 38th Construction Squadron (CST) to the 86th CRG, where it became the 86th CST. The 496th ABS was to prove especially challenging, since it was on a Spanish Eurofighter base and had a relatively small (approximately 96 personnel) US contingent and relatively little in the way of support structure. The 86th CST mainly consisted of local nationals, but there was soon a move to add a larger American contingent so it could perform operations outside of Germany. On 11 August 2008 Russia began an invasion of its neighboring country Georgia. The 86th AW had Airmen from both the CRG and ACOMG on the ground in Georgia, and soon the 37th AS C-130Es began to fly humanitarian aid into the country while many of the 86th AW Airmen remained in place and performed their duties. Then, on 20 September, tragedy. Major Rodolfo \\"Rod\\" Rodriguez was killed by a truck bomb in Islamabad, Pakistan, outside the Marriott Hotel. Rodriquez, a 34-year-old Air Force Academy graduate and commander of the Contingency Training Flight, 86th Construction and Training Squadron, became the first Ramstein Airman to die in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and the first Ramstein Airman to die in combat since World War II. In August 2010, the 86th Airlift Wing became a \\"sister wing\\" to Poland's 3rd Airlift Wing, the Poles having purchased some C-130Es aircraft from the United States.

The objective of micro-enterprise education is to empower individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to start their own businesses. Description The Academy is closely allied with the BYU Ballard Center for Economic Self-Reliance. As defined by the Micro- enterprise Education Initiative at the Ballard Center, ‚ÄúMicroenterprises are defined as small businesses. They are prevalent throughout the developing work due to necessity enterprise. Where large companies that employ many are scarce and jobs are limited even with a degree, many have had to survive but starting their own businesses (microenterprises).‚ÄùBallard Center website, accessed May 17, 2013 The Academy for Creating Enterprise relies upon this idea and hopes that individual lives will be transformed and poverty will be eradicated through education. The Academy's philosophy can be summarized by the following quote offered by Joseph F. Smith that appears on the website: \\"Our idea of charity, therefore, is to relieve present wants and then to put the poor in a way to help themselves so, in turn, they may help others.\\" History & Operations Steve and Bette Gibson founded The Academy in 1999 in Cebu city, Philippines with the intent of providing basic business training to young Filipinos to start their own businesses. The Academy continues to have a base in the Philippines and it now has a campus in Mexico. The Academy currently has over 220 Chapters in Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines and is looking to continue to expand into Brazil and Africa. The Academy for Creating Enterprise is a non-profit organization with headquarters in Provo, Utah. The business college is financed by independent donors, the Called2Serve Foundation, and by student tuition. The Academy also partners with the BYU Ballard Center to recruit interns interested in social innovation and micro-enterprise. The current program directors for The Academy‚Äôs campuses located in Cebu and Mexico City are Jacobo Albores (Mexico) and James O. Fantone (Philippines) ‚Äì both native to their respective countries. Programs The Academy runs a five-week program that combines hands-on experience with classroom instruction, guest lecturers, and team innovation. Upon entering The Academy, students are placed into groups and begin income-generating activities. The students put into practice the concepts they learn in class through business activities in the marketplace. This program and materials developed by the Gibsons have been adopted by several other organizations around the world, including Ascend Alliance in their Bolivia micro-enterprise program.\\"Where There Are No Jobs\\", teaching manual for The Academy for Creating Enterprise As mentioned in the preface to the manual \\"Where There Are No Jobs,\\" it has also been used in Ghana, but it fails to mention the organization that used it. The program of The Academy centers on 25 ‚ÄúRules of Thumb‚Äù developed by Steve and Bette Gibson to provide foundational business practices for entrepreneurs.Academy for Creating Enterprise Website, accessed May 17, 2013 During and upon completion of the program, students of The Academy are expected to use their skills to successfully navigate business ventures, and teach others. While the Academy does not claim to higher aspirations, Brigham Young University - Hawaii has agreed to offer graduates of the Academy a certificate of completion, making the Academy for Creating Enterprise one of a small group of LDS institutions of higher education. In addition to the colleges officially sponsored by the LDS Church (BYU, BYU-Idaho, BYU-Hawaii, and the LDS Business College), the only other LDS Institutions of higher learning (albeit not officially sponsored by the Church) are Southern Virginia University and the Academy for Creating Enterprise. There is, however, a new initiative by the Acorn to Oak Foundation focused on building a privately funded LDS university in Argentina. If successful, that would bring the number of LDS institutions of higher learning (both officially sponsored and independent) to seven.

The Harem was a space for Muslim women of all classes, but the Imperial Harem wielded immense political power. Women in the Ottoman Empire had different rights and positions depending on their religion and class. Ottoman women were permitted to participate in the legal system, purchase and sell property, inherit and bequeath wealth, and participate in other financial activities. The Tanzimat reforms of the nineteenth century created additional rights for women, particularly in the field of education. Some of the first schools for girls were started in 1858, though the curriculum was focused mainly on teaching Muslim wives and mothers. The Sultanate of Women, an era that dates back to the 1520s and lasted through the mid-seventeenth century, was a period during which high-ranking women wielded political power and public importance through their engagement in domestic politics, foreign negotiations, and regency. Queen Mothers and Chief Concubines gained considerable influence through Harem politics. Some of the most influential valide sultans were Nurbanu Sultan, Safiye Sultan, Handan Sultan, Halime Sultan, K√∂sem Sultan and Turhan Sultan. Social life During the Ottoman Empire, many women's interactions were limited to socializations among fellow women, and members of their family. Women socialized with each other at their homes and also at bathhouses. High society women, particularly those who did not live in the palace, visited one another at each other's homes. Those who lived in the palace were subject to strict etiquette that prevented ease of socializing. Townswomen visited each other at home and also at the bath-house, which was an important social ritual. Women would bring their finest bathing accessories, such as embroidered towels and high, wooden sandals.Faroqhi, 106. As with any society, style of dresses played an important role in the social lives of Ottoman women. According to the wife of the British ambassador to Istanbul during the 18th century, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the attire of Ottoman women \\"reflected their dignity and rights\\". The way an Ottoman woman dressed indicated not only her status in society but also the occasion. There were two categories to dress: the clothing for daily dress and the attire for special occasions. With the spread of Western influence during the 18th century, Ottoman women had increased interactions with European women. These interactions gave way to new changes in the social lives of Ottoman women. To be able to communicate with European women, they learned French. The interactions with Westerners during this period changed the social lives of many Ottoman Women. This advancement created a new connection between Ottoman and European women; it became normal to invite and accept European acquaintances into their homes and their lives.  Harem  When studying about the Ottoman empire, the word ‚ÄòHarem‚Äô comes up a lot. Harem has many different descriptions, many articles about what activities took place inside the Harem and its relationship with the Sultans of the empire. One of the best ways to have a look inside the Harem is with the help of people who have personal experiences with the Harem. The Sultan‚Äôs Harem is described as a very diverse place. The vast majority of women there were Christian women. Turkish‚Äôs popular history of the Harem was based on the memoirs, personal letters, and travel accounts by foreign women. Cavidan was Abbas Hilmi II‚Äôs wife and a convert to Islam. She offered some interesting analysis in the history of evolution of Harem because she also once lived in a Harem. She said that the Harem was preserved in a manner that was desired by a false version of the religion of Islam. And it gave rise to a ruling class that was full of jealousies and was not in accordance with the principles and the doctrine of Muhammad. According to her account, over time the household Harems of husbands became the Harems of women that were administered with great jealousy and were denied every right and action. She compared it to the Harem from Muhammad‚Äôs time and said that women had every right in Harem during his time and they possessed complete freedom. Through her writing she talks about how Muslims women‚Äôs positions have altered over time into something that was not intended by its prophet. Different people with Harem experiences are going to have different point of views. Cavidan expressed criticism of the religion and culture she embraced, whereas Leyla Saz who also had personal experience within the Harem conveyed her childhood and young adulthood memories within the Ottoman Harem in very positive terms. She called her days in Harem as the happy days of that age and as she writes about it, she said she actually finds herself there again. Cagatay Ulucay, one of the most prominent historians of the Ottoman Harem wrote exclusively about the Ottoman women. He published series that included ‚Äòletters from Harem‚Äô. In this series he talked about the private lives of the Sultans, Ottoman officials, and their family members. He called his series of letters written by the wives and daughters of the Sultans as the ‚Äúsmall rays of light that leak out from the Harem‚Äù. In these letters the private lives of Harem inhabitants are greatly emphasized. He stresses the women‚Äôs veiled faces and the heavy curtains that signifies women‚Äôs strict seclusion. This also emphasizes how some previous accounts about the Harem inhabitants could be inaccurate because of the privacy of the Harem and that it could not be penetrated by foreign men. One of the Cagatay Ulucay series talks about the relationship between Sultan Suleiman I and Hurrem Sultan, one of the Harem inhabitants. He describes her as not only beautiful also extremely clever. ‚ÄúUlu√ßay‚Äôs description of Hurrem‚Äôs ‚Äúsweet talking‚Äù her way into an extremely powerful position and her ability to ‚Äúconquer‚Äù the heart of the king of kings with her soft words and poetic style is a demonstration of the influence women had over the most important men of state and of the vital role they played in the Ottoman elite.‚Äù Love aside, the Sultans were not as easily influenced by the Harem women even if that was Hurrem Sultan especially when it came to ruling the empire. What really influenced Sultan‚Äôs performance in the empire was how they were brought up. So, instead of the women of the Harem it was the mothers of Sultans who attempted to socialize their children according to their cultural preferences and loyalties which played a huge role in who they were allies with and who they fought against in their ruling period. The mothers of Sultans were given the title of Valide Sultan during the reign of their sons as Sultans. Harem was also a place of learning for the young girls. The girl‚Äôs education in the Ottoman Empire was a product of the Harem system and the new technical schools. The education programs initiated by the Ottoman state had their roots in the Harem. Education Prior to the nineteenth century, there did not exist formal public education for Ottoman women. Education for women began at a young age and in the privacy of their homes: girls were taught household duties. Young Ottoman girls were taught through the Harem education; they learned skills such as \\"sewing, embroidery, playing the harp, singing, and memorizing the customs and ceremonies\\". Tanzimat reforms of the nineteenth century brought additional rights to women, particularly in education. Some of the first schools for girls, called \\"R√º≈ütiyes\\", opened in 1858, followed by a boom in 1869 when elementary education was rendered mandatory. During the 1860s, many new educational opportunities existed for Ottoman women. This decade saw the first middle- level schools, a teacher training college and industrial schools, called \\"ƒ∞nas Sanayi Mektepleri\\", which were created concurrently with industrial schools for boys. Whereas men's education focused on job training, women's education focused on shaping girls to evolve into better Muslim wives and mothers with refined social graces.[26] Women that began their education during their adolescence started by focusing on the formal skills that they lacked, for example, their manner to speak, reading and writing. The schools taught a variety of subjects and as mentioned before, incorporated harem education into the new public education. Movement for women's education was sparked in large part by women's magazines, the most recognized among them being Hanimlara Mahsus Gazette (The Ladies‚Äô Own Gazette), which ran for fourteen years and was successful enough to have established its own press. With managing editors and staff writers primarily being women, the magazine aimed to enable women to evolve into better mothers, wives, and Muslims. Its topics varied between discussions of feminism, fashion, economic imperialism and autonomy, comparisons of Ottoman modernization with Japanese modernization, and technology. The magazine also included the usual content of a middle-class women's magazine of the nineteenth century: royal gossip, the science of being a housewife, health, improving fiction, and child-rearing.Frierson, 76. Examples include: patterns for home sewing based on European fashions and advertisements for Singer sewing machines. Politics Prior to the sixteenth century, women did not hold a great deal of political power. This shift occurred when S√ºleyman the Magnificent ascended the throne in 1520. Under S√ºleyman's rule, the imperial harem was moved to the palace Early Years. Women of the Sultan's Imperial Harem achieved more power during the sixteenth century because the closer proximity allowed for more influence. This period during S√ºleyman's reign until the mid-seventeenth century, was referred to as the ‚ÄúSultanate of Women‚Äù. Notably, most women of the Imperial Harem were slaves. Slavery was common in the Ottoman Empire, and the Sultan's wives and concubines would often be slaves themselves. However, the mother of the Sultan, who would herself have likely been a slave in the Harem, would garner the special status of Valide Sultan. This Queen Mother enjoyed enormous political power. The Queen Mother and leading concubines aided in the creation of domestic political factions, in negotiation with foreign ambassadors and as advisers to the sultan. The importance of the Imperial Harem grew as women became more politically involved; with this growth, more opportunities for women were opened as well. During this era, high-ranking women were politically empowered and were granted public importance. Two important figures that modeled the public importance of the queen regent were K√∂sem Sultan and Turhan Sultan: with their roles, they transitioned the relationship of the queen mother and her son from a strictly private one to one that incorporated the empire. Despite the new prominence of the Imperial Harem, most of the women remained constricted to its wall. Only the queen mother exercised mobility outside the Imperial Harem: even this mobility was limited. The queen mother would attend public ceremonies and even meetings with high ranking government officials, all the while remaining heavily veiled. Due to their confinement, the women of the Imperial Harem had many networks that aided in their political power. But their power was great within the Imperial Harem itself as well. The queen mother and leading concubines had the capability to shape the careers of the harem's officials by arranging marriages of princesses or of manumitted slaves. These unions boded well for those who arranged them because they would create relationships. The women in the Imperial Harem would then have agents that would aid them which allotted them more power.

These rights included, but were not limited to, the ability to own property, to approach the judicial system on their own without consulting a male (including bringing divorce claims to court), to acquire education in religious and scholarly fields, and to be financially independent. Muslim women in the Ottoman Empire were governed by the Sharia, which deals with many topics addressed by the secular law including crime, politics, economics, and personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, everyday etiquette and fasting. There are two primary sources of sharia laws: the precepts set forth in the Quranic verses (ayahs) and the Hadith, which is the application of Islam practiced by Muhammad and his companions.Esposito, John (2001), Women in Muslim family law, Syracuse University Press, Human attempts to apply sharia is known as fiqh, also known as the collection of Islamic Jurisprudence. The fiqh is expressed in four major Sunni schools of law, of which the Ottomans favored the Hanafi school which is regarded as being the most flexible and liberal application of sharia. Islamic judges (qadis) presided over the interpretation of sharia in Islamic courts during the Ottoman Empire. The Qadi could offer binding decisions in sharia courts, resting his interpretation on the prescribed school of law. The muftis provided opinions (fatwas) on questions regarding the pursuit of sharia. Some women possessed a great deal of influence during this era. Muslim women in particular ‚Äúbought and sold property, inherited and bequeathed wealth, established waqfs [endowments], borrowed and lent money, and at times served as holders of Timars (a sort of fiefdom given to Ottoman Cavalry and the lower nobility). These waqfs (also spelled wakfs) are charitable allotments of property for public use. These areas are given up by the owner‚Äôs free will for use by their own community. Waqfs during the Ottoman period were commonly used as institutions for public improvement and included establishments such as schools, libraries, mosques, and public kitchens. These kitchens typically served the poor and other underprivileged demographics, such as orphans and the widowed. Many Ottoman women were among the selfless founders of waqfs, with the existence of their allotments being pivotal in their communities‚Äô economic life. Out of 30,000 waqf certificates documented by the GDPFA (General Directorate of Pious Foundation in Ankara), over 2,300 of them were registered to institutions that belonged to women. Of the 491 public fountains in Istanbul that were constructed during the Ottoman period and survived until the 1930s, nearly 30% of them were registered under waqfs that belonged to women.Aydƒ±n, M. A. ‚ÄúOsmanlƒ± Toplumunda Kadƒ±n ve Tanzimat Sonrasƒ± Geli≈ümeler‚Äù (Women in Ottoman Society the Deve- lopments after the Tanzimat), Sosyal Hayatta Kadƒ±n (The Woman in Social Life), (ƒ∞stanbul: Ensar Ne≈üriyat, 1996): 144. Women also held usufruct rights on Miri [state] land, as tax farmers and in business partnerships.‚Äù Owing to their leverage in sharia courts and the importance of these courts in the empire, non-Muslim women often viewed conversion as a way to attain greater autonomy.Marc Baer, ‚ÄúIslamic Conversion Narratives of Women: Social Change and Gendered Religious Hierarchy in Early Modern Ottoman Istanbul.‚Äù Gender & History, Vol.16 No.2 August 2004, 426. They also had access to the justice system and could access a judge, as well as be taken to court themselves. In comparison, many married European women did not enjoy these privileges, nor could they own property until the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. Because women had access to the legal system, much of the information about their role in Ottoman society is sourced from court records.Suraiya Faroqhi, Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire. London: I.B. Tauris, November 29, 2005, 101. In cities, such as Bursa, women freely appeared in court during the seventeenth century. One example documents a court record from 1683 (1095) in which a woman sued someone who allegedly seized a shop that she technically inherited after her husband died. In a separate case, a woman sued someone who allegedly broke into her home and robbed her of various items. While these two examples demonstrate the extremely active role that women held in Ottoman courts, many other instances are documented in the sources that are cited.Gerber, Haim. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Position of Women in an Ottoman City, Bursa, 1600-1700.‚Äù International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 12, no. 3, 1980, pp. 231‚Äì244. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/163000. The status of women in regional courts can be adjudged through preserved court records dating back to 1541 in the Aintab court. Although women were permitted to bring cases in front of the court, men and women were not considered truly equal by the court, and were subject to separate codes of law and procedures.Peirce, Leslie. Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab, University of California Press, 2003. ProQuest Ebook Central, http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/berkeley- ebooks/detail.action?docID=223551. Created from Berkeley-ebooks on 2018-03-06 15:49:06. Maximum proceedings of Ottoman courts were based on the morality of an oath, or testimony, provided by a witness. Crimes required a minimum number of witnesses to be presented before the court. Yet, women were largely unable to take this oath to testify to the court, and since they spent much of their time in the presence of other women, it was often impossible to find male witnesses to testify on their behalf. But while Ottoman women may have had a slightly unequal balance of power in contrast to the males, this did not mean that court cases in which women sued men did not occur; even if the men were members of their own family. Sales of property between the sexes within the same family were also very common; this included agricultural property, real estate, and orchards. Women also openly sued male members of their family in Ottoman courts. One instance includes when a woman sued her own husband due to the fact that he built an addition on their house, with this addition being on a portion of the house that she states belonged to her. Her request for demolition of the new portion of the house was granted.Gerber, Haim. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Position of Women in an Ottoman City, Bursa, 1600-1700.‚Äù International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 12, no. 3, 1980, pp. 231‚Äì244. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/163000. Divorces were frequent and could be initiated by either party. However, men did not have to provide a reason and could expect to be compensated and to compensate their wives, whereas women had to provide a reason, such as ‚Äúthere is a lack of good understanding between us.‚Äù Upon divorce, women would lose any financial benefit received courtesy of the marriage and would sometimes have to pay the husband.Faroqhi, 103. Inheritance issues were also resolved in Ottoman courts, with the defendants often being family members of the women that were suing them. Women in Ottoman cities, such as Bursa, freely used the abilities granted to them by the Islamic Law of inheritance and were actually treated quite justly in many court cases during the 17th century.  Women and Inheritance  When a Muslim die there are four duties which need to be performed. They are: # Pay funeral and burial expenses. # Paying debts of the deceased. # Determine the will of the deceased (which can only be a maximum of one third of the property). # Distribute the remainder of estate and property to the relatives of the deceased according to Shariah Law. Ayah XI of Surah An-Nisa, Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) asserted that the share of males equals twice that of the share of females. And if there is only one daughter, for her it is half of one's estate. The Qur'an introduced a number of different rights and restrictions on matters of inheritance, including what were at that time general improvements to the treatment of women and family life. The Qur'an also presented efforts to fix the laws of inheritance, and thus forming a complete legal system. This development was in contrast to pre-Islamic societies where rules of inheritance varied considerably. Furthermore, the Qur'an introduced additional heirs that were not entitled to inheritance in pre-Islamic times, mentioning nine relatives specifically of which six were female and three were male. The laws of inheritance in the Qur'an also included other male relatives, such as the husband and half-brothers from the mother's side, who were excluded from inheritance in old customs. The heirs mentioned in the Qur'an are the mother, father, husband, wife, daughter, brother who shares the same mother, full sister, sister who shares the same mother, and consanguine sister. The Qur'an improved the status of women by identifying their share of inheritance in clear terms. It also completely forbade the practice of inheriting widows. This is not meant as a regular legal ordinance but is part of the Qur'anic endeavor to improve the position of women. The Qur'an does not explicitly mention the shares of male relatives, such as the decedent's son, but provides the rule that the son's share must be twice that of the daughter's. Muslim theologians explain this aspect of inheritance by looking at Islamic law in its entirety, which bestows the responsibility and accountability on men to provide safety, protection and sustenance to women. One explanation of why a daughter is entitled to only half that of the son is that Islam decrees that women, upon marriage are entitled to a \\"dowry\\" from the husband (in addition to any provision by her parents). It is thereafter the husband's obligation to care for and maintain his wife and the \\"dowry\\" is, therefore, essentially an advance of inheritance rights from her husband's estate which returns to his possession after the formalities over. Women in the Ottoman Empire could inherit property from their deceased parents or husbands. The estates make it quite clear that at least in as far as the court was concerned, the Islamic law of inheritance was applied exactly in accordance with the letter of the law. This means that wherever a woman is mentioned as an heir of the deceased, be she a wife or a daughter, she is also on the list of those getting shares, and her share is indicated. The legal court divide the estate among the legal heirs according to the orthodox (sharia) law. Succession documents drawn up by the kadi, an official in Ottoman Empire, are sufficient proof that the property actually passed into the hands of the women. The kadi records of seventeenth-century Bursa contain a large number of documents which, in effect, describe legal disputes involving women over estates and inheritances and they show that in many cases women did actually inherit the property. Women in the Ottoman Empire owned agricultural land - the one type of property which expressed more than anything the integrity of the traditional Muslim family. The divergence between the law and practice in disputes involving agricultural property has been viewed as the most flagrant. But before we can check the relation between the theoretical and the actual in this respect, it must be emphasized that in matters of agricultural land the relevant \\"law of the book\\" was not the ordinary Islamic law of inheritance, but rather an Ottoman state law. By this law there was \\"direct succession\\" only from a deceased male land possessor to his male sons. If the deceased had only daughters and a wife (or wives), those successors had to pay a tapu tax (a sort of entry fine) to the landowner in order to get the land. In most cases the landowner was sipahi, holder of a fief. This shows that women were able to inherit property from their deceased parents and husbands due to the Ottoman State Law.  Women in Economic Life  An Egyptian fellah woman, a peasant or farmer, distinguished from the effendi land-owning class, painted by Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann in 1878. Jerichau-Baumann based this and similar works on her experiences travelling the Ottoman Empire in 1869‚Äì1870 and 1874‚Äì1875. Unlike many of her contemporaries, she had access to the region's harems and could base her paintings on personal observation. Many of her subjects insisted on being painted in the latest Paris fashions.Women in the Ottoman Empire were involved throughout the economy. The most prominent example of women‚Äôs economic activity is in the ability of noble and other upper class women to establish waqfs in order to create and maintain institutions like a bimaristan or madrasa in their own name. This was especially common for royals like Nurbanu, the mother of Murat III, who established the Atik Valide Mosque which included a hospital in Istanbul. Scholarly analysis of waqfs in Ottoman cities have found that a considerable number of waqfs are under the name of women, and in some places, close to 50 percent of waqfs. A waqf is comparable to modern day trusts or foundations; it is established by a living person and financed through the revenue-bearing assets of that person, typically to fund some form of social service. Records of waqfs serve as a major indicator for the financial assets and lasting economic impact of women in the Ottoman empire. Another way in which women held economic power was through property ownership. A review of kadi records in the Ottoman city of Bursa found that one-third of women with estates also owned their own home. Besides for owning homes in their own names, women also commonly sold or leased their property. In urban areas, women owned or rented shops, sometimes even owning artisanal workshops; urban women often owned plots just outside the city like vineyards and mills, as well. Women also regularly bought and sold agricultural land, despite an Ottoman state law that prevented women from inheriting agricultural land unless a state tax was paid. Stemming from this ownership is the fact that women were an active part of agricultural life, usually taking over the cultivation of fields and orchards in the absence of their husbands, and records indicate that some women maintained agricultural property separate from that of their husband‚Äôs. Women were actively involved in credit transactions, both giving and receiving money loans. Reviews of some estates in the city of Bursa reveal that many men received loans from their wives, although the circumstances under which these loans were created are ambiguous. There is also evidence of women lending money to multiple different people at a time, indicating that they could serve as semi-professional moneylenders. Women were involved in investment, as well, although their level of participation in this area is partially obscured by the practice by some women of appointing male relatives to carry out their business and investments on their behalf. Even so, there are records of women investing directly in businesses, merchants, and other commercial ventures. While women could participate in trade indirectly through investing in merchants and trade ventures, there is little evidence of women working in trade themselves. One aspect of economic life in which women had limited involvement was artisanship; there is little archival evidence showing that women were themselves members of craft guilds of various cities. However, in some areas it has been observed that women had a complementary relationship with artisans by providing capital and tools, as well as by renting out buildings to be used by artisans in everything from baking to textile work. In other contexts, women often had an adversarial relationship with guilds, with most archival evidence of women‚Äôs involvement in guilds found in lawsuits. Some women inherited a hisse from their relatives which would allow them to participate in guilds, but there are certain cases of guilds suing women with hisses for trying to participate in guild life. In one such case, litigation was brought forth against Fatma Hatun by Bursa's candlemakers guild; their claim was that there had never been a woman in this guild before so her participation in the guild must have been illegal. In response, Fatma Hatun answered that it was within her right as she inherited a hisse of candlemaking from her father. There is also evidence of women eventually choosing to sell these hisses. Despite their limited participation in the dominant guild system, it is likely that women established their own organizations, particularly for primarily women-led services like singing, dancing, washing, and nursing. A subset of women artisans in the Ottoman empire worked entirely on their own, producing goods in their homes and selling them in the streets, eschewing the support of labor organizations, middlemen, and traditional shops.  Jewish women during the Ottoman Empire  During the Ottoman Empire, Jewish women mostly remained confined to their private family lives and had little involvement beyond their homes. This continued until the 19th century. Women faced seclusion in religious life as well; while attending synagogue a laced veil would be placed in the area of worship to render women symbolically invisible to the opposite sex. Ottoman homes of Jewish families often had a protected garden and a main courtyard, which was known as the kortijo. Life of Ottoman Jewish women was focused on their extended families as well as these kortijo. Jewish women utilized this space to complete chores and finish embroideries, and well off women would brief their servants at the same time. Most women of the Jewish community were not educated, which is in contrast to men who were formally educated. Jewish women were restricted to speaking Judeo-Spanish, with the exception of elite women, who were generally given greater access to education and could possibly speak more than one language. Jewish women's lives, as mentioned earlier, were based on family and focused on conducting the domestic scene. Mothers, grandmothers, and other elder Jews would pass on strong traditions to young women. Their husbands did not learn the Jewish traditions from their wives. Instead, they had close ties with the rabbis and would learn about the Judaic culture through religious leaders, which gave them a more in- depth understanding. Prior to the 19th-century, Jewish women were only educated in certain aspects of Judaic culture; they were only taught the \\"domestic\\" activities which included the subjects of keeping kosher, maintaining holiday traditions, and observing life cycle events. Besides being educated in the domestic aspect of Judaic culture, Jewish women also had to follow a moral code. They took pride in respecting this code due to the fact that one who respected the code also had a good reputation within the community. Such a reputation was not just for the woman herself but for her entire family, which is why following this code of conduct was important. Women of Jewish descent were able to sell goods, and some even participated in real estate, but the most common line of work for Jewish women was to participate in their family business. Most family businesses were textile- related and/or embroidery related; others worked in the silk-making industry. However, everything that was made in these homes or workshops was for the elite families in the Ottoman Empire. Jewish women were also placed in a certain class and it was predetermined by one's family roots as well as the family roots of the husband.Pam√©la Dorn Sezgin, ‚ÄúJewish Women in the Ottoman Empire,‚Äù in Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewry from the Golden Age of Spain to Modern Times, ed. Zion Zohar (New York: New York University Press, 2005), 216‚Äì217  Slavery of women  An 18th-century painting of the harem of Sultan Ahmed III, by Jean Baptiste Vanmour Circassians, Syrians, and Nubians were the three primary races of females who were sold as sex slaves in the Ottoman Empire. Circassian girls were described as fair and light-skinned and were frequently enslaved by Crimean Tatars then sold to Ottomans. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 pounds sterling and the most popular with the Turks. Second in popularity were Syrian girls, with their dark eyes, dark hair, and light brown skin, and came largely from coastal regions in Anatolia. Their price could reach up to 30 pounds sterling. They were described as having \\"good figures when young\\". Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 pounds sterling. The concubines of the Ottoman Sultan consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. The Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of Valide Sultan which raised her to the status of a ruler of the Empire (see Sultanate of Women). One notable example was K√∂sem Sultan, daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century.See generally Jay Winik (2007), The Great Upheaval. Roxelana (also known as H√ºrrem Sultan), another notable example, was the favorite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.Ay≈üe √ñzakba≈ü, H√ºrrem Sultan, Tarih Dergisi, Sayƒ± 36, 2000 Giulio Rosati, Inspection of New Arrivals, 1858‚Äì1917, Circassian beauties The concubines were guarded by enslaved eunuchs, themselves often from pagan Africa. The eunuchs were headed by the Kizlar Agha (\\"agha of the [slave] girls\\"). While Islamic law forbade the emasculation of a man, Ethiopian Christians had no such compunctions; thus, they enslaved and emasculated members of territories to the south and sold the resulting eunuchs to the Ottoman Porte.Gwyn Campbell, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p. ixSee Winik, supra. The Coptic Orthodox Church participated extensively in the slave trade of eunuchs. Coptic priests sliced the penis and testicles off boys around the age of eight in a castration operation. The eunuch boys were then sold in the Ottoman Empire. The majority of Ottoman eunuchs endured castration at the hands of the Copts at Abou Gerbe monastery on Mount Ghebel Eter. Slave boys were captured from the African Great Lakes region and other areas in Sudan like Darfur and Kordofan, then sold to customers in Egypt. During the operation, the Coptic clergyman chained the boys to tables and after slicing their sexual organs off, stuck bamboo catheters into the genital area, then submerged them in sand up to their necks. The recovery rate was 10 percent. The resulting eunuchs fetched large profits in contrast to eunuchs from other areas.

The population was 3,857 at the 2010 census. The elevation is an average of above sea level. Franklinton is located north of New Orleans. A Franklinton physician, Jerry Thomas, represented Washington Parish in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1988 to 1999. He was elected to the District 12 seat in the state senate, serving from 1999 to 2004. He had succeeded Phil Short of Covington, who resigned. Prior to his state service, Dr. Thomas was the Washington Parish coroner from 1980 to 1988. Elected in 2015, Beth Mizell, a businesswoman from Franklinton, is the current District 12 state senator.  History  Franklinton was founded in 1819, originally under the name of Franklin. It was designated as the parish seat of government on February 10, 1821, two years after the parish was carved out from St. Tammany Parish. In 1826 the town's name was changed to Franklinton, as there was already another town named Franklin in St. Mary Parish. In 1826, representatives and citizens from both communities showed up in then-state- capital New Orleans to state their cases for keeping the name \\"Franklin.\\" The legislature allowed Franklin in St. Mary Parish to retain its name, while changing the Washington Parish's newer seat to Franklinton. The parish was largely rural, based in extensive pine forests. 20th century to present *1935 lynching: In the early hours of January 11, 1935, a small group of white men forced their way into the Washington Parish jail in Franklinton, fatally shooting and beating Jerome Wilson, 30, an African-American man convicted of murder. He had pleaded for mercy. Five days earlier the Louisiana Supreme Court had granted Wilson a new trial, on the grounds that he had not received a fair trial. The decision cited that he was tried, convicted, and sentenced within ten days of his arrest in August in the slaying of Deputy Sheriff Delos C. Wood in a gunfight on the Wilson place. The lynch party took Wilson's body by car and dumped it along a rural road three miles (5 km) from town; then they dispersed. The body was found by a passerby on the road two hours later. Police officers said they thought Wilson was shot because his cries would have aroused parish authorities, who twice had thwarted attempts to lynch him.New York Times; 1935-01-13 In 2005, much of Franklinton, as well as most of Washington Parish, sustained damage from Hurricane Katrina. It caused extensive damage along the Gulf Coast.

It is a ground-dwelling bird which feeds on insects and seeds. It has about 9 different subspecies, some of which may be better treated as separate species. It is 14 to 16 cm long with a fairly long, slightly downcurved bill. The plumage varies geographically but is basically brown above and pale below with a streaked breast, pale stripe over the eye, dark edge to the ear-coverts and pale rufous bar across the wing. The tail is dark with a buff base and variable amounts of buff on the outer feathers. The trilling song is often given in flight and also varies geographically. The species occurs in open habitats such as grassland, sand dunes and beaches from sea level to high in the Andes. It is widespread and sometimes common across much of Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, parts of Peru and Bolivia and in southernmost Brazil. In winter there is some northward migration by southern birds with a few reaching Paraguay. The bird lays two or three white eggs in a chamber at the end of a tunnel, up to 3 metres long, dug into an earth bank or sand dune.

Tyne and Wear Archives preserve documents relating to the area from the 12th to the 21st century. It is based in the former headquarters of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which it shares with Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. History The Archives Service was established in 1974 by Tyne and Wear County Council, drawing in the collections of the former Newcastle Archives Office, which closed. On the abolition of the county council in the local government reorganisation of 1986 Tyne and Wear Archives Service became a joint service of the five metropolitan districts, managed by Gateshead Council. Since 1976 Tyne and Wear Archives Service has been located at Blandford House, Newcastle upon Tyne, the former headquarters of the Co- operative Wholesale Society, which it shares with Discovery Museum. In April 2009 Tyne and Wear Archives Service merged with Tyne and Wear Museums to form Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums (TWAM).http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/news/tyne- wear-museums-and-tyne-wear-archives-service-to-merge/ In July 2013 it was announced that the Archives' Shipyards collections were included on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. UNESCO stated: 'The shipbuilding collections deposited at Tyne & Wear Archives are the major source of information on the many shipyards in the North-East of England that helped to shape the unique identity of the region and made shipbuilding one of the key economic activities on Tyneside and Wearside.... The records are strong in both breadth and depth, and no other archive in England and Wales appears to hold such a wide and comprehensive range of material.' http://www.unesco.org.uk/uk_memory_of_the_world_register In December 2013 The National Archives announced that Tyne and Wear Archives was amongst the first group of UK record offices to achieve Accredited Archive status.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/897.htm County / Chief Archivists *Dr. W.

History and details At night The name of the ride, Vogel Rok, refers to the adventure of Sinbad and the Bird Roc from the 1001 Arabian Nights; the extensive theming covers, beside the ride, the building and the queue line. The building has as a frontage a giant colorful Roc, the largest bird in Europe, according to the Guinness Book of Records. In the opening year there weren‚Äôt a lot of effects in the ride, and the link between the story and the ride wasn‚Äôt very clear. Since then a Serpent‚Äôs mouth has been added at the end of the ride, which lights up as the train goes through it. There used to be a laser-light-show at the queue, but that has been removed. This was done because the lights were too low, and people would look at them, thereby damaging their eyes. A new queue line was constructed in 2007, which led to the old queue line being partially abandoned. More themed decorations were also added. Vogel Rok used to operate with three trains. Problems with the brakes in 2015 forced the ride to operate with two trains only. This issue was solved as part of a renovation in 2018. The ride Lasers project over the train as it climbs the lift-hill and seen to the left are four Rocs flying off. In a strong curve down leftwards the train dives towards the ground and several more curves bring the train through a tunnel of lasers. The train then falls into a helix and goes through a Serpent‚Äôs mouth, which lights up as the train passes through it. The last curve is decorated with fiber optic lights, portraying the diamond treasure. Apparent wind-effects stimulate the ride-experience. The ride has an onboard sound system with a synchronized soundtrack written by composer Ruud Bos, who also wrote the musical themes for Droomvlucht, Fata Morgana and Villa Volta.

Background  Rachel Herz completed her undergraduate degree in psychology and biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and an MA and Ph.D in the Psychology Department at the University of Toronto. After completing her PhD in 1992, she won a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Post-Doctoral Award and took her research to the University of British Columbia. In 1994, she received the Ajinomoto USA Inaugural Award for Promising Young Scientists and joined the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia as an assistant member. In 2000, Herz joined the faculty at Brown University, first as a member of the Psychology Department and now as a visiting professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of Brown University Medical School. She is also part-time faculty in the Department of Psychology at Boston College. Herz is a TED-X speaker and since the mid-1990s, Herz has been consulting for many of the world's leading multinational fragrance and flavor companies and regularly lectures to national and international audiences. In 2004 Herz had to change her relationship with Brown University to a more limited involvement so that she could pursue other creative enterprises. It was at this time that she began writing The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell (William Morrow/Harper Collins Publishers) as well as working on other means to educate and stimulate the general public about the chemical senses. Her commercial ventures include The Educated Palate. Herz has Canadian and American citizenship.  Psychology of smell  Herz has been conducting research on smell, emotion and cognition since 1990. Her research has shown how odor-evoked memory is emotionally unique compared to other kinds of memory experiences,Herz, R.S. \\"Are Odors the Best Cues to Memory?

New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc.Herz, R.S. (2003). \\"The effect of verbal context in olfactory perception\\", Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 132, 595-606. A third area of her research concerns the role of body-odor and fragrance in heterosexual attraction.Herz, R.S. & Cahill, E. D.

Recently, Herz has begun studying how we perceive food and how food-based emotions influence us. Theoretically guided by perspectives from cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology, Herz uses psychophysical, self-report, cognitive-behavioral and neurological techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to investigate these topics.

Surrounded by the city, Lido Isle was incorporated as part of Newport Beach in 1906. At that time it was part sandbar and part mudflat. There are no commercial facilities on the island other than a small snack bar open in the summer, and its only link to the city is a small bridge. The man-made island is solely residential with approximately 1,800 people living on the island. History Lido Isle cross section, Newport Beach CA The Lido Peninsula, Newport Beach CA In 1904 Henry Huntington became a partner with William Collins in the Newport Beach Company. In exchange for extending the Pacific Electric Railway to Newport Beach, Huntington received and a wide right-of-way for the railway. A mudflat was included in addition to the other land given Huntington. This mudflat became known as Electric Island, Pacific Electric Island, and finally Huntington Island. In 1923, Huntington Island was purchased from Pacific Electric by W. K. Parkinson for $45,000. Parkinson, a former conductor on the Pacific Electric, made his fortune from land investments when oil was discovered near Bakersfield. Parkinson spent more than a quarter-million dollars dredging the harbor and using the fill to raise the isle more than ten feet above the high tide line. The Griffith Company was hired to build seawalls, a bridge, piers and roads. The new development was one of the first master planned communities in California and was conceived to resemble a European resort. Parkinson envisioned the space as a resort similar to those in the Mediterranean. After dredging the island was renamed Lido Isle in homage to Lido di Venezia near Venice. Geography The island has one bridge providing access. The community was one of the first in Southern California to be built with underground utilities. As part of the Mediterranean-theme the development was built with streets named after many Mediterranean cities, including Barcelona, Genoa, Nice and Ithaca. The names of the two main streets, Via Lido Nord and Via Lido Soud, also reflect this theme. The island has about 800 homes with about 250 on the water. Most are built in a Mediterranean Revival Style architecture, but there are some Cape Cod and modern style homes as well. Community Burgee of the Lido Island Yacht Club Lido Island Yacht Club January 8, 2013 Lido Isle Club House The geographic and social center of this \\"semi-private\\" community is the Lido Isle Club House, which hosts many community clubs and organizations, including the Lido Isle Yacht Club, and includes a snack bar and bay beach. All property owners must pay an annual assessment, and all residents are Community Association members. The island plays a big part in the annual Newport Christmas Boat Parade.99th Annual Newport Beach Christmas Boat Parade Lido Isle Yacht Club The Lido Isle Yacht Club was founded in 1928, though it did not fully organize until 1947. The club‚Äôs burgee is a combination of the white burgee with red St. George‚Äôs Cross of the Royal Yacht Squadron and blue fouled anchor of the South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club. Its mission has been to educate young sailors and provide activities to the people of Lido Isle.

It was constituted on 12 April 1808 as the 6th Infantry and consolidated with 4 other regiments in 1815 to form the present unit. Origin Although the original 2nd Infantry Regiment was constituted in March 1791 and fought in the Miami Indian Campaign and the War of 1812 at Fort Bowyer in Alabama its history and lineage is not a part of the present regiment. That regiment became part of the 1st Infantry through the consolidations of 1815. For the history about the original 2d Infantry Regiment please refer to the page for the 1st Infantry Regiment At the end of the War of 1812, an act of Congress dated 3 March 1815 reduced the size of the Regular Army to a maximum of 10,000 men. Eight infantry regiments, one rifle regiment and an artillery regiment was formed from the remains of the 46 existing regiments, while the cavalry was eliminated. This was done with no regard for the traditions of the existing regiments. The old regiments which happened to be closest together were pooled to form new regiments and the numbers assigned the regiments were based on the seniority of the colonels commanding them. In accordance with the act, on 17 May 1815 a new 2nd US Infantry was created by the consolidation of the 6th, 16th, 22nd, 23rd, and 32nd Regiments of Infantry, all then located in upper New York and Vermont. The date of organization of the present 2nd Infantry is that of the original 6th Infantry, 12 April 1808. The regiment's headquarters was in the cantonment at Sackett's Harbor. Colonel Hugh Brady became the regiment's commanding officer with Henry Leavenworth as major and Ninian Pinkney as lieutenant- colonel., in The regimental number was \\"2\\" because Brady was the second most senior regimental commander in the United States Army. Colonel Brady was in command of the 22nd Infantry at the time of the consolidation and, though he served in several other commands and reached the rank of major general, he remained colonel commandant of the 2nd Infantry Regiment from his residence in Detroit until his death on 15 April 1851. The War Department ruled that the present 2nd Infantry bear upon its colors the campaign honors of the regiments consolidated into its organization. Thus, the colors bear the campaign streamers for Canada, Chippawa and Lundy's Lane, even though it did not participate in any of the battles in Canada during the War of 1812. The present 2nd Infantry also bears the two battle honors earned by the original/old 2nd Infantry for the Miami Campaign (1790-1795) and Alabama 1814. Military service First Indian War period In the ensuing years the regiment was primarily concerned with manning and constructing forts around the Great Lakes. When the Black Hawk War of 1832 erupted the 2nd Infantry was sent to Illinois but did not participate in any fighting. The regiment returned to its posts on the Great Lakes. During the Second Seminole War, from 1838 to 1842, the regiment was in Florida, where it was on the move daily, fighting and building roads and installations. In April 1840 with Colonel Brady attending to other duty assignments Lieutenant Colonel Bennett C. Riley assumed command of the regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Riley remained in command of the regiment until January 1850. In 1843 the regiment returned to its posts on Lakes Ontario and Champlain in upstate New York. War with Mexico When war broke out with Mexico in 1846, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was sent to Camargo, Mexico and joined General David E. Twiggs' Brigade. From September 1846 to December 1847 the regiment campaigned from the Rio Grande to Mexico City, fighting in battles at Veracruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Moline del Rey and Chapultepec. Second Indian War period In September 1848 because of conflicts with the Indians in Oregon and California the regiment was sent west. The regiment sailed via Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn and Santiago, Chile, to California. Between 1849 and 1853 the regiment was in California occupying stations from Goose Lake on the north to Fort Yuma on the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the east, scouting, providing protection for the '49ers and fighting throughout the entire area. The regiment returned to New York in 1853 only to be sent to the Western Plains where it constructed or reconstructed forts, built roads and scouted the hills and plains along the Missouri River as far west as Fort Kearny, Nebraska and Fort Laramie, Wyoming. American Civil War During the Civil War the 2nd Infantry fought in the early Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri and the first Battle of Bull Run. The regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and fought in engagements such as Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg. By June 1864 the commissioned and enlisted strength of the regiment had reached such a low figure, less than 100 men, that at the request of the regimental commander the remaining enlisted men were transferred to Company C, and that company was given a full complement of officers and non-commissioned officers. From then until December 1864 the entire regiment consisted of just Company C. On 18 April 1869 the 2nd Infantry was consolidated with the 16th Infantry and the consolidated unit was designated as the 2nd Infantry. The 2nd Infantry bears nine battle honors from the Southern Campaign through its 1869 consolidation with the 16th Infantry. These honors were earned by the 16th Infantry: Atlanta, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Georgia 1864, Kentucky 1862, Mississippi 1862, Murfreesboro, Shiloh, and Tennessee 1863 Third Indian War period From 1877 to 1886 the regiment was in Washington, Oregon and Idaho Territory campaigning against the Nez Perce, then the Bannocks and then a band of the Eastern Shoshones called the Sheepeaters. In 1886 it moved to Fort Omaha, Nebraska to help fight the Sioux. The 2nd Infantry was on the Pine Ridge Reservation on 29 December 1890 when the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred and, although the regiment was not involved, one officer from the regiment was wounded there. The regiment remained on the western plains until 1898. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War In 1898 the regiment was deployed to Cuba at the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, with Headquarters, Staff, Band, and Companies C and G sailing on the same ship with the Rough Riders. The regiment, under the command of LTC William Wherry, (regimental commander COL John C. Bates had been promoted to brigadier general of volunteers) fought in battles along the road to San Juan Heights and the battle of Santiago, where it fought on the extreme left of San Juan Heights. In August 1898, the regiment returned to the United States only to return to Cuba in January 1899. The regiment stayed in Cuba until September 1899 when it returned to the United States to prepare for deployment to the Philippines. Philippine Insurrection In August/September 1900 the 2nd Infantry was deployed to deal with the Philippine Insurrection during which it fought in over 25 engagements on several of the islands. In May 1903 the regiment returned to duty in the western United States, it was stationed at Fort Logan, Colorado and Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming. In February 1906 the regiment was redeployed to the Philippines and remained there until returning to the United States in March 1908. The 3rd Battalion went to Fort Assinniboine, Montana and the balance of the regiment to Fort Thomas, Kentucky for training and garrison duties until deploying to Hawaii in 1911. World War I When war broke out, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was on security duty in the Hawaiian Islands guarding interned German ships and sailors, as well as various U.S. installations. In July 1918, it returned to the United States and was assigned to the 19th Division at Camp Dodge, Iowa. The war ended just as the regiment was about to deploy to France. In 1919, the regiment was relieved from the 19th Division and resumed as a separate regiment. Post-World War I In September 1919, following the 2nd Infantry Regiment's release from the 19th Division, it was stationed at Camp Sherman, Ohio. In October 1921 the 2nd Infantry Regiment was ordered to Fort Snelling, Minnesota and Fort Sheridan, Illinois but as they reached their destinations the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were eliminated and headquarters and 1st Battalion were at Fort Sheridan as a training battalion. In August 1922 the 2nd Infantry Regiment was redesignated a combat regiment and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were reorganized using personnel from the 54th Infantry. In March 1923 the regiment was assigned to the 6th Division. Headquarters and 1st Battalion stayed at Fort Sheridan, 2nd Battalion was at Fort Wayne (Detroit), Michigan and 3rd Battalion was at Fort Brady, Michigan. Colonel Frederick B. Shaw, who wrote a history of the regiment, commanded from 1928 to 1930. Between August 1922 and October 1939 no major changes were made and the 2nd Infantry Regiment participated in garrison training, maneuvers, field training and other duties. World War II In 1939 prior to World War II, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was assigned to the 5th Infantry Division. In February 1942 the regiment was sent to Iceland for training, to provide security for U.S. bases located there, and to load and unload supply ships. It was then sent to England and then Ireland for training. In July 1944 the 2nd Infantry Regiment along with the 5th Infantry Division landed in Normandy, France. It became part of General George Patton's Third United States Army, leading the way in the breakout from the beaches of Normandy in Operation Cobra, capturing Rheims and then seized Metz after a major battle at Fort Driant. When the Battle of the Bulge began the 2nd Infantry Regiment moved to the battle zone in the area of Nideranven, Luxembourg. In January 1945 the 2nd Infantry Regiment forced a crossing of the Sauer River and attacked into the Siegfried Line. The regiment then crossed the Rhine River near Oppenheim and secured the crossing for other Third Army units. The unit then spearheaded the attack into Czechoslovakia and was located near the town of Volary when the word came to cease all forward movement at 08:31 on 7 May 1945. Post-World War II Following World War II the 2nd Infantry Regiment returned to the United States and was inactivated and activated several times and returned to Germany for a period. During the Korean War the regiment was stationed at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania with the 5th Infantry Division training recruits for deployment to Korea. In June 1957, at the time of the Pentomic reorganization, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was stationed at Fort Ord, California with the 5th Infantry Division, serving as a training regiment. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battle Group, 2nd Infantry and released from assignment with 5th Infantry Division and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division. At this time both the 1st and 3rd Battalions were inactivated. In January 1959 the 2nd Battle Group was reassigned to the 24th Infantry Division in Germany. In February 1962 the 1st Battalion was activated and assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division.

Both battalions were stationed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Vietnam War When the fighting in Vietnam escalated the 1st Infantry Division was restructured and Battle groups were redesignated as infantry battalions. On 12 July 1965 the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 2nd Infantry were relieved from assignment to the 5th Infantry Division and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division with no change of station and in September 1965 the two battalions deployed to Vietnam, landing on the beach at V≈©ng T√†u in October 1965. From there they proceeded to their assigned areas, Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh for the 1st Battalion and Lai Khe for the 2nd Battalion. The battalions initially fought as light infantry in the areas north and west of Saigon. On 2 January 1967 the 2nd Battalion officially became a mechanized infantry battalion. The 1st Battalion sustained its first major casualties of the war on 21 December 1965 when the enemy ambushed the command group of Company B as the company was moving out of Bien Hoa on routine patrol.

The 2nd Battalion fought its first major battles at Ap Bau Bang on 12 November 1965 and Ap Nha Mat on 5 December 1965. Heavy losses were suffered at Ap Nha Mat and three soldiers are still listed as missing. During four and a half years the battalions were involved in major operations such as: Junction City, the largest operation conducted up to that time, Lam Son II, Paul Bunyan, B√π ƒê·ªëp (aka Battle of Hill 172), An L·ªôc, and An L·ªôc II and numerous other operations and small unit actions.

It ran from 1849 until 1892, originally over the Great Western Railway (GWR) and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. As the GWR expanded, the destination of the train changed to and briefly to . Early history The name Flying Dutchman has a convoluted history. In common with many steam and diesel locomotives such as a London and North Eastern Railway A1s and British Rail class 55 'Deltic', the Flying Dutchman was named after The Flying Dutchman, a famous racehorse, which had won both the Derby and St. Leger in 1849. The racehorse was in turn named after the famous Dutch Admiral Tromp. In 1845 the 09:30 morning express train between London Paddington and was taking 5 hours with stops at , Bath, Bristol and , this being reduced to 4¬Ω hours during that year. In 1848 the train, now the 09:50 from London Paddington, covered the 53.1 miles to Didcot in 55 minutes, setting a world record start- to-stop average of 57.9 mph. The return train was the 11:45 from Exeter. In 1849, the Train took on the name \\"Flying Dutchman\\", and added a stop at Chippenham without extending the overall journey time. The up train time was changed to 12:30 which gave an arrival at Paddington of 17:00. In the 1850s performance deteriorated, but the introduction of a service from London Waterloo to Exeter Queen Street (now Exeter Central) in 4¬æ hours by the London & South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1862 resulted in the down Flying Dutchman being retimed to leave Paddington at 11:45 with the 1840s journey time of 4¬Ω hours being restored. This was, however, a brief interlude and soon the time to Exeter has stretched to 5 hours and 5 minutes. At this time the train left Paddington with 7 coaches. Two were detached at Swindon; one for Weymouth and the other for Cheltenham, and after detaching 2 more at Newton Abbot for Torquay the remaining three coaches worked through to Plymouth. By 1867 things had got so bad for the GWR that the Flying Dutchman ceased running, being cancelled in October of that year. Latter years The Flying Dutchman began running again in 1869, taking 4¬æ hours from Paddington to Exeter, but this was accelerated in 1871 when the LSWR began a service taking 4¬Ω hours from London Waterloo; the Flying Dutchman was now taking 4¬º hours to Exeter and 6¬º hours to Plymouth, and during the summer was extending to Penzance although taking an extra 3 hours. By 1876 the LSWR, in extending their main line to Plymouth, introduced a train that reached Exeter in 4 hours and Plymouth in 6 hours 38 minutes, and also carrying third class passengers in contrast to the GWR express which only carried First and Second class passengers. In 1879 the Flying Dutchman, still running on the broad gauge, was equalled by a new standard gauge train; the 15:00 from Paddington, which also carried third class passengers; third class was finally introduced to the Flying Dutchman in 1890. The last run of the Flying Dutchman, still Broad gauge, was on 29 May 1892; the 11:45 from Paddington the following day was a standard gauge express train, but not distinguished by any name.

Built in 1963, the 26-storey hotel was initially the only 5-star hotel on the island side of the territory. It closed in May 1995, and was demolished soon thereafter along with Beaconsfield House (the old address of the Information Service Department) and carpark to make way for a commercial development, the Cheung Kong Centre. History The 26-storey building was owned by Hutchison Whampoa, who licensed Hilton Hotels Group to operate it for 50 years. The 750-room hotel opened in 1963 and was one of the most prestigious in the colony, a favorite of tourists and dignitaries alike.Robert O'Halloran, The Hong Kong Hilton taken from Cornell Hotel & Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 1 August 1997 The Hong Kong Hilton was the first hotel in the world to introduce the minibar in all of its hotel rooms in 1974. In the months following its introduction in-room drink sales increased 500%, and the Hong Kong Hilton's overall annual revenue was boosted by 5%. This led the Hilton group rolled out the minibar concept across all its hotels the following year. In January 1994, with about 20 years of the management contract to run, Hutchison announced the buyout of the remaining term for US$125 million. The hotel subsequently closed its doors on 1May 1995, the landmark was to be torn down and rebuilt as a multi-storey commercial office complex and headquarters for Li Ka-shing's flagship holding company, Cheung Kong Holdings. The Hong Kong Hilton had a staff of 850. Its employees were given an average of nine months' salary as part of their redundancy packages. Moreover, Hutchison also placed over 60% of its staff in the new Harbour Plaza Hotel in Hung Hom. Hilton Hotels still maintains a presence on Hong Kong Island, with the Conrad at Pacific Place in Admiralty.

History This light was built in 1828 by John Donahoo, who erected a brick conical tower along the plan he had used at several other sites in the Bay. In 1825 Congress had allocated funds to build a light at Cedar Point, four miles south at the mouth of the Patuxent River, but further consideration led to a decision to mark Cove Point and the shoal which jutted into the bay. A new appropriation in 1828 allowed construction of the light and keeper's house in the same year. The original Argand lamps were replaced in 1855 with a fifth-order Fresnel lens; this in turn was upgraded to a fourth-order lens in 1857. A fog bell added in 1837 was moved several times and was mounted on both wood and iron towers before ending up on the roof of a wooden shed built in 1902 to house a foghorn. The foghorn equipment was moved in 1950 to a separate brick building, but the fog bell remains on the shed. Erosion was a significant problem, but was eventually brought under control through a seawall initially constructed in 1892 and upgraded in 1913 and 1993. The keeper's house was enlarged in 1881 when it was converted to a duplex with housing for two keepers and their families. and again in 1925 when inside kitchens were installed. In 1950 a separate small house was built as home to a third keeper and his family. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as Cove Point Lighthouse. The keepers remained until 1986 when the light was finally automated. The light was in good condition, with much equipment remaining from prior years, when it was turned over to Calvert County in 2000. Since then it has been administered by the Calvert Marine Museum, which allows access to the light and grounds in the summer months. Cove Point remains an active aid to navigation and is the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the Chesapeake Bay.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio. Background In 1995, a consortium of individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds and interests connected, determined to provide families of the Texas Hill Country faith-based learning for their high school age boys and girls. The founders articulated a mission for the school to provide an exemplary education to students within a Christian community in order to educate young minds with a strong base of ethical and moral values. Feasibility studies were conducted in local and surrounding communities from 1996-1997, and the results affirmed that interest and funding potential existed for the new school. The planning group sought guidance from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio. After receiving counsel from Archbishop Patrick Flores and with cooperation of the Fredericksburg Deanery, the Our Lady of the Hills College Prep project was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization in 1998 (under the original working name, ‚ÄúSt. Ignatius Regional Catholic High School‚Äù). Our Lady of the Hills humbly opened her doors in 2002 with just 19 students in portable classrooms. By 2007, the success of the students and the growth of the school sparked an insurgence of major local support which assisted in the construction of our now 54,000 square foot multi-use permanent campus on 80 acres of Texas Hill Country. Completed in 2009, the campus now sports 8 classrooms, 2 science labs, 2 fine art rooms, computer lab, library science center, chapel, full size competition gym, and administrative space.  Educational Philosophy  The college preparatory curriculum and extra-curricular activities are rooted in the traditions of the Jesuit and Dominican orders and based on their philosophies of education and service to others. Our Lady of the Hills assists students in becoming mature in their faith and critical thinking. OLH challenges each student to develop his or her talents to the fullest and foster a lifelong commitment to support justice and service to others.  Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam // For the Greater Glory of God  Jesuit education is a call to human excellence, to the fullest possible development of all human qualities. The well rounded and rigorous curriculum of Our Lady of the Hills is a call to critical and disciplined studies, a call to develop the whole person, head and heart, intellect and feelings all for the greater glory of God.  Veritas // Truth  Dominican philosophy aims to achieve four main objectives: intellectual formation, world mission, social communication, and justice. As a Dominican inspired institution, Our Lady of the Hills prepares students to pursue truth- ‚ÄúVeritas‚Äù, to give compassionate service, and to participate in the creation of a more just and humane world. OLH is committed to independent thought and respect for divergent opinions.  Veritas Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam // Truth for the Greater Glory of God  Combined, these two traditions make up the values-based, academically renowned curriculum at Our Lady of the Hills and provide the foundations for its objectives. OLH seeks to develop in the student both an attitude of openness to growth and an acceptance of personal responsibility; to prepare the student to be intellectually competent; to help students to become mature in their faith; to guide students to grow as loving people; and to foster in the student a commitment to support justice. Approximately sixty percent of the student body is Catholic.  Governance & Accreditation  Our Lady of the Hills is an independently owned nonprofit organization under the governance of a board of directors. OLH works in collaboration with the Catholic Schools division of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio regarding its mission, guidelines, and accreditation.

Thomas Day, The History of Sandford and Merton, A Work Intended for the Use of Children, Vol. 1, 6th ed. London: Printed for John Stockdale (1791), vii. One of Day's early biographers, George Warren Gignilliat Jr., lists some of the source on which Day drew: Plutarch's Lives, Xenophon's Cyropaedia, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Thomas Percival's A Father's Instructions, Henry Brooke's The Fool of Quality and Arnaud Berquin's L'Ami des Enfants. George Warren Gignilliat Jr., The Author of Sandford and Merton: A Life of Thomas Day, Esq. New York: Columbia University Press (1932), need page number. that is only nominally held together by a thread narrative. The \\"history of Sandford and Merton\\" follows the reformation of Tommy Merton who is transformed from a spoiled six-year-old boy into a virtuous gentleman (Day defines virtue as the appreciation of the value of labour). Tommy, having been pampered and indulged by his mother and their slaves in the West Indies, is a proud and ignorant aristocrat; he lacks the sterling qualities of \\"plain, honest\\" Henry (Harry) Sandford, the yeoman farmer's son, who becomes his model and mentor in the book. Both are guided by a mentor, Mr. Barlow. Day wanted to emphasize the series of stories he had collected, which ranged from moral tales to scientific lessons to fables, but the book became famous for the story of Tommy and Harry. Many abridgements which appeared after Day's death reflect this interest; they condense the book, remove sections on educational philosophy and highlight the relationship between the two boys.Introductory essay on Sandford and Merton . Retrieved on 8 June 2007. One, for example, was by Lucy Aikin in 1868 as Sandford and Merton: In Words of One Syllable. The text embodies many of the educational and philosophical tenets espoused by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom Day admired greatly. Sandford and Merton was his way of presenting Rousseau's philosophy to British children in the form of fiction.Darton, 145. Harry, the farmer's son, \\"is the personification of Rousseau's ideas... He abjures the decadence of modern life... To the surprise of Tommy Merton and his parents, Harry is unimpressed, and even critical, of their luxuries, their fine food, their many possessions, preferring his own uncomplicated life of hard work, active virtue and simple pleasures.\\" Over the course of the narrative, Tommy comes to appreciate and adopt these values as well. Legacy So prevalent was the ideal of the book portraying good morals for children, that Ethel Turner started her book Seven Little Australians with the warning \\"If you imagine you are going to read of model children, with perhaps; a naughtily inclined one to point a moral, you had better lay down the book immediately and betake yourself to 'Sandford and Merton'...\\" Full Text of Seven Little Australians.

Plot history Beaconsfield Arcade along Queen's Road Central, with Dent's Fountain, c.1890 HSBC building (second design) The site was carved out of a rocky hill on the shore of Victoria Harbour. In 1841, Hong Kong's Deputy Superintendent of Trade and acting administrator, Alexander Johnstone, had the upper part of the hill levelled to build a home. The slope below was cut away to provide space for stables and outbuildings, and the rock and earth were used for reclamation.Chapter 7: Defending the North House GIS through the years. HK Government. Retrieved 27 July 2007 First generation building Beaconsfield House site was originally home to the Beaconsfield Arcade (so named for Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield), built in 1878 by Emanuel R Belilios. Belilios, a Calcutta-born Sephardi Jew who was at that time a Hong Kong Bank director and LegCo member, sold it to the government in 1898 under some controversy - the Legco Public Works Committee resolution to acquire it passed on Mr Belilios' own vote over a suppressed protest for pecuniary interest disqualification.http://www.legco.gov.hk/1897-98/h980223.pdf.

Beaconsfield was also named for a government building near Government Hill built in the late 19th century. It was demolished to make way for the French Mission Building of 1917 (at one time also owned by Mr Belilios). Second generation building The building was constructed in a utilitarian style of the 1960s, and consisted of 6 storeys. The lower floors were occupied by the Royal Hong Kong Regiment, which had its officers' and NCOs' mess in the building.Joshua Fellman, 'Unlikely' project closer with Hilton approval , The Standard, 18 September 1995 The building thus housed three service messes, a post office and, dominating the ground floor fa√ßade, a large public toilet. The Information Services Department moved its offices from the west wing of the Government Offices to Beaconsfield House. The ISD and its 100 staff had moved into the two uppermost floors. The space was configured into a news room, press conference room, Chinese translators' office, teleprinter service, photographic studio and darkroom, art studio, editorial section, film unit and two theatres for the censorship of commercial feature films. A publications distribution office, administrative office and various secretarial desks also shared the space. The messes served relatively cheap meals and were open to the public. Access The building could be accessed from Queen's Road by a single lift. The building had another pedestrian entrance at the fourth storey linked to Battery Path by a small bridge, at the level of the French Mission Building. Redevelopment In May 1994, there was criticism when it was revealed that the government entered into discussions with Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings for the private sale of the site, along with the adjacent Government car park site.Joshua Fellman, Government silent over 'private sale', The Standard, 4 May 1994 Talks had commenced in May 1993, and were finalised in August 1995Winnie Wu, Agreement over Hilton premiums finalised in near term , The Standard, 2 August 1995 In April 1995, Executive Council has approved the sale of the site, for a sum estimated to be in excess of HK$5.5 billion.Karen Chan, Exco agrees to property firm's redevelopment plans for Beaconsfield House Cheung Kong gets go-ahead , The Standard, 28 April 1995 In September 1995, the planning authorities passed the redevelopment proposals for the 9,900 m¬≤ combined site.Joshua Fellman, Development plan for Hilton site passed , The Standard, 16 September 1995 With a plot ratio of 15, building (including car park) would be built.

Background  Ikramullah was born in London, England to an Indian Bengali family. Her father, Mohammed Ikramullah, later became the first Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and her mother, Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, was one of the first Muslim women to become a politician and diplomat in the Indian Subcontinent. Her mother, who later served as a Delegate to the United Nations and an Ambassador to Morocco, was a member of the Suhrawardy family of Calcutta, India. She became a Mohajir by moving to West Pakistan, though many of her prominent relatives remained in India and others remained in what would become Bangladesh. Amongst her uncles she could count Mohammad Hidayatullah, Vice President and Chief Justice of India and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Premier of Bengal and Prime Minister of Pakistan. Her siblings include a brother and two sisters: Inam Ikramullah, Salma Sobhan and Princess Sarvath El Hassan of Jordan. She settled in Canada in the 1970s and was married to the prominent Canadian Urdu short story writer and novelist, Syed Moin Ashraf, until he died in 2003. He claimed to have descended from the Sufi Saint Ashraf Jahangir Semnani and some of his stories include Fatherhood and Reborn. Together, they have a daughter named Aamna.  Education  Ikramullah was trained as an artist at the Byam Shaw School of Art (BFA) and later specialized in lithography at the Slade School of Fine Art in London.  Career  Ikramullah designed and wrote a filmstrip for the NFB film Making Faces, which won the First Prize for Art Education in Oakland, California in 1989. She also completed a film regarding the cultural life of Muslim women of the Indian Subcontinent. She teaches painting and printmaking at the Ottawa School of Art. In a review of Ikramullah's 1994 solo exhibition, Nancy Baele of the Ottawa Citizen wrote that \\"Her paintings and prints...reflect her view that Canada fosters an interior life, Karachi an exterior one. She merges the two through collage, a layered look and the compositional constants of architectural arches and cloaked figures to create an emotional tone of dream-like reverie.\\" In Art India, Pakistani art critic Quddus Mirza describes Ikramullah as belonging to a wave of Pakistani diasporic artists. Her prints and collages are in the Library of Congress, the National Gallery of Jordan and the Cartwright Gallery in Bradford, among others. In 2014, Ikramullah published a book (with accompanying DVD) about interconnections between Hindu and Muslim cultures called Ganga Jamuni, Silver and Gold: A Forgotten Culture (Toronto: Bayeux Arts, Inc; Dhaka: Bengal Publications, 2013). One reviewer described how Ikramullah's \\"Westernised education but Ganga-Jamuni moorings helped her in appreciating music, fine arts and the traditional embroidery and designs on clothes.\\" References Category:Alumni of the Byam Shaw School of Art Category:Alumni of the Slade School of Fine Art Category:Artists from Karachi Category:Artists from London Category:Artists from Ottawa Category:Canadian people of Pakistani descent Category:Canadian people of Bengali descent Category:Living people Category:Suhrawardy family Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Naz Ikramullah"},{"id":"11666813","text":"Katherine K.

Life and career  Davis was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on June 25, 1892. She composed her first piece of music, \\"Shadow March,\\" at the age of 15. She graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1910, and studied music at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. In 1914 she won the college's Billings Prize.A prize that is still offered each year to an outstanding Wellesley College music student: After graduation she continued at Wellesley as an assistant in the Music Department, teaching music theory and piano. At the same time she studied at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Davis also studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. She taught music at the Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts, and at the Shady Hill School for Girls in Philadelphia. She became a member of ASCAP in 1941.ASCAP Biographical Dictionary, Fourth edition, p. 114. and was granted an honorary doctorate from Stetson University, in DeLand, Florida. Katherine K.

She died on April 20, 1980, at the age of 87, in Littleton, Massachusetts.Boston Globe obituary She left all of the royalties and proceeds from her compositions, which include operas, choruses, children's operettas, cantatas, piano and organ pieces, and songs, to Wellesley College's Music Department. These funds are used to support musical instrument instruction. Music Many of her over 600 compositions were written for the choirs at her school. She was actively involved in The Concord Series, multiple-volume set of music and books for educational purposes. Many of the musical volumes were compiled, arranged, and edited by Davis with Archibald T. Davison, and they were published by E.C. Schirmer in Boston. She wrote \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" (originally titled \\"The Carol of the Drum\\"), in 1941. It became famous when recorded by the Harry Simeone Chorale in 1958: the recording sailed to the top of the Billboard charts and Simeone insisted on a writer's royalty for his arrangement of the song.

SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment (SciBooNE), was a neutrino experiment located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in the USA. It observed neutrinos of the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) that are produced when protons from the Fermilab Booster-accelerator were made to hit a beryllium target; this led to the production of many short-lived particles that decayed into neutrinos. The SciBooNE detector was located some 100 meters downrange from the beryllium target, with a 50 meter decay-volume (where the particle decay into neutrinos) and absorber combined with 50 meters of solid ground between the target and the detector to absorb other particles than neutrinos. The neutrino-beam continued through SciBooNE and ground to the MiniBooNE-detector, located some 540 meters downrange from the target. SciBooNE was designed to make precise measurements of neutrino and antineutrino cross-sections on carbon and iron nuclei, and combine with MiniBooNE to improve neutrino oscillation searches for sterile neutrinos. The cross section measurements have been used by the T2K experiment which began running in Japan in 2009. The SciBooNE detector had three subsystems: SciBar, the EC (electron catcher) and the MRD (muon range detector). They can be seen in the event display of SciBooNE's first neutrino event. Many of the components of SciBooNE were recycled from other experiments; thus the budget of SciBooNE was as low as 1.2 million dollars. SciBooNE took data from June 2007 to August 2008. The operation consisted of 3 data runs; run 1 and 3 were antineutrino studies and run 2 was neutrino study. Data analysis and results were published after 2008. In total, SciBooNE published eight peer-reviewed journal articles, garnering over 711 citations, and many more articles in conference proceedings. Highlights include results about muon neutrino disappearance and muon antineutrino disappearance, which were world-leading at the time of publication. In Fermilab's records, the SciBooNE experiment status is listed as \\"Completed: Aug. 1, 2013\\".

(University of Toronto Press, 2013) Promise of Eden Promise of Eden is a 1980 book by Doug Owram, examining the Canadian expansionist movement between the years 1856 and 1900. The book was published by the University of Toronto Press, and was based on work Owram had done for his doctoral dissertation at the University of Toronto. Owram sets out to study how the idea of the Canadian West evolved in the minds of central Canadians. He traces conceptions of Rupert's Land from a barren wasteland to an area that was ripe for settlement and offered the best, and sometimes only, hope of prosperity and redemption for the Canadian nation. Particular emphasis is given to the Red River Rebellion and its effects on the perception of the West and how indicative it was of burgeoning Western alienation. The book continues by examining the re- evaluation of the suitability of the region for agriculture and settlement. Also noted is the desire of central Canadian expansionists to foster the emergence of a 'British' moral character on the prairies. Owram elaborates on the problematics associated with settling Palliser's Triangle and the work of John Macoun; an individual whose interpretation of the Triangle caused many hardships for future settlers. A concluding section of the book further discusses sources of Western alienation and offers a brief discussion of the historiography of Red River Settlement.
