It continued in various forms until late in the 16th century and was supplanted by the institution of serfdom. History From the 9th century, the lands of Baltic tribes was introduced into the slave supply movement. Often attacked by Vikings who were capturing slaves there, Lithuanians eventually started enslaving other nations themselves. By the end of 12th century, Lithuanians began slave hunting raids in foreign lands. Baltic tribes started attacking each other and taking slave women and children, while the men were usually killed. Often Lithuanian nobility families had young girl slaves that would work around the houses and farms. Usually girls were taken from Rus' lands and sometimes from Poland.LDK istorija: Auklės krikščionės In the 1200s – 1210s, Lithuanians would often attack Estonian lands and take numbers of slaves back home, but most of the raids end up unsuccessfully as Lithuanian forces was often attacked by Germans and Livonians on their way back home.Prekyba belaisviais: Pajamų šaltinis Between 1277 and 1376, there were recorded 24 big raids by Lithuanians in Prussia and Polish lands, whose aim was to bring back more slaves to Lithuania. Some records show that Grand Dukes of Lithuania would sell slaves to foreign countries for the income. In 1383 Jogaila was accused of selling German slaves to Russian lands. In 1588 the third Statute of Lithuania was signed, which finally completely abolished slavery, but still promoted serfdom (see Serfdom in Poland#15th to 18th centuries for details).Ways of ending slavery1588 m.

The 38 runs to Carlisle via Abbeytown, and the 71 runs to Carlisle via Newton Arlosh and Kirkbride, ensuring that residents of the parish have links to Cumbria's county town. History Holme Low became a separate parish in 1845, after St. Paul's church was constructed in Causewayhead, and was known as Low Holme or Holme St. Paul's. It had previously been part of the parish of Holme Cultram (which is now the civil parish of Holme Abbey, centred on Abbeytown). In the mid-late 19th century, the parish of Holme Low also included the town of Silloth (described in an 1868 survey as a \\"hamlet\\"), as well as Skinburness and other areas which are now part of the civil parish of Silloth-on-Solway. However, the parish's history can be traced back even further. In Roman times, when the entire Solway coast was fortified to defend against incursions across the sea, a series of milefortlets were constructed beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. Remains of one of these have been discovered near Beckfoot, just beyond the parish's southern boundary. A Roman road also ran through the parish at that time. In the early 14th century, a castle was built at Wolsty to defend Holme Cultram Abbey from attacks by Scots, who would frequently raid across the Solway. Not much remains of the castle today; it was already in a ruined state by 1572, and had been entirely demolished by the 18th century. From 1862 until the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, the Carlisle and Silloth Bay railway line ran through Holme Low. Within the parish itself there was a single station, Blackdyke Halt, which closed with the rest of the line in the 1960s. In 1954, this line was the first in Britain to replace its steam locomotives with diesel ones, so for a short while, Holme Low was one of the only places in the country to see diesel-fuelled trains. The parish council The hamlet of Causewayhead is in the civil parish of Holme Low. Holme Low Parish Council usually meets four times a year, once per quarter, in February, May, August, and November. Meetings are open to the public, and the county councillor responsible for the parish and representatives of the local police force are invited to attend. Parish councils in England have certain duties and responsibilities to the communities they serve, and Holme Low is no exception. The council is responsible for liaising with Cumbria County Council on a variety of issues which affect residents, including highways, footpaths and bridleways, public transportation, and planning applications. It is also responsible for its own budget and assets, and communicating with Cumbria Constabulary on policing issues within the parish. Holme Low Parish Council also maintains a website with detailed minutes of meetings and financial information, all of which is freely available to residents of the parish.

It continued operating overseas services throughout World War II. After the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1946, European and South American services passed to two further state-owned airlines, British European Airways (BEA) and British South American Airways (BSAA). BOAC absorbed BSAA in 1949, but BEA continued to operate British domestic and European routes for the next quarter century. A 1971 Act of Parliament merged BOAC and BEA, effective 31 March 1974, forming today's British Airways. History War years On 24 November 1939, BOAC was created by Act of Parliament to become the British state airline, formed from the merger of Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd. The companies had been operating together since war was declared on 3 September 1939, when their operations were evacuated from the London area to Bristol. On 1 April 1940, BOAC started operations as a single company. Following the Fall of France (22 June 1940), BOAC aircraft kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the allied world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. During the war, the airline was sometimes loosely referred to as 'British Airways', and aircraft and equipment were marked with combinations of that title and/or the Speedbird symbol and/or the Union Flag. A BOAC Boeing 314 Clipper lands on Lagos Lagoon, 1943 BOAC inherited Imperial Airways' flying boat services to British colonies in Africa and Asia, but with the wartime loss of the route over Italy and France to Cairo these were replaced by the expatriate 'Horseshoe Route', with Cairo as a hub, and Sydney and Durban as termini. Linking Britain to the Horseshoe Route taxed the resources of BOAC. Although Spain denied access, Portugal welcomed BOAC's civilian aircraft at Lisbon. However, the Mediterranean route from Lisbon or Gibraltar to Egypt via Malta risked enemy attack, so the long West Africa route had to be employed (over-water via Lisbon, Bathurst, Freetown, Lagos), then by landplane to Khartoum on the Horseshoe Route. The Empire routes had contained landplane sectors, but the Armstrong Whitworth Ensign and de Havilland Albatross ordered to replace the Handley Page HP.42 'Heracles' biplanes had proved disappointing, leaving the Short Empire flying boats as the backbone of the wartime fleet. (Only a handful of these had long range tanks but many were eventually upgraded with larger tankage and operated at overload weights.) The Empire flying-boats were at their limit on the 1,900-mile Lisbon-Bathurst sector. Refuelling at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands was permitted by Spain for some Empire flying-boat flights in 1940 and 1941. In 1941 longer range Consolidated Catalinas, Boeing 314As (and later converted Short Sunderlands) were introduced to guarantee non-stop Lisbon to Bathurst sectors (thus eliminating the need to refuel at Las Palmas). BOAC's flying-boat base for Britain was shifted from Southampton to Poole, Dorset, but many flights used Foynes in Éire (Ireland), reached by shuttle flight from Whitchurch. Use of Foynes reduced the chance of enemy interception or friendly fire incidents over the English Channel. BOAC had large bases at Durban, Asmara, Alexandria and a pilots' school at Soroti, Uganda. Experimental flights had been made across the North Atlantic pre-war by Imperial Airways Empire flying-boats with improved fuel capacity, some using in flight refuelling, culminating in a series of mail/courier flights made by BOAC's Clare and Clyde to La Guardia in camouflage during the Battle of Britain. These were BOAC's first New York services. In 1941, BOAC was tasked with operating a 'Return Ferry Service' from Prestwick to Montreal to reposition ferry pilots who had flown American- built bombers from Canada, and they were provided with RAF Consolidated Liberators with a very basic passenger conversion. This was the first sustained North Atlantic landplane service. By September 1944 BOAC had made 1,000 transatlantic crossings. In late 1942, the new hard-surface airport at Lisbon permitted the use of civil registered Liberators to North and West Africa and Egypt. Arguably, BOAC's most famous wartime route was the 'Ball- bearing Run' from Leuchars to Stockholm (Bromma) in neutral Sweden. Initially flown with Lockheed 14s and Lockheed Hudson transports, the unsuitable Armstrong Whitworth Whitley \\"civilianised\\" bombers were also used between 9 August and 24 October 1942 (\\"Civilianised\\" meant that all the armaments and unnecessary guns and turrets had been removed, a legal requirement for operating a commercial civilian service to a neutral country). The much faster civilian registered de Havilland Mosquitoes were introduced by BOAC in 1943. The significance of the ball-bearings is debatable, but these night flights were an important diplomatic gesture of support for neutral Sweden which had two DC-3s shot down on its own service to Britain. Other types used to Sweden included Lockheed Lodestars, Consolidated Liberators, and the sole Curtiss CW-20 (C-46 prototype) which BOAC had purchased; these types had more payload, and some had the range to avoid the German-controlled Skaggerak direct route. Between 1939 and 1945 6,000 passengers were transported by BOAC between Stockholm and Great Britain. 1940 British Straits Settlements colonial war- time passport issued to a BOAC pilot flying on the Horseshoe route Early post-war operations BOAC Avro York freighter operating a scheduled service at Heathrow in 1953 BOAC Short Solent 3 G-AHIN Southampton served the airline's route from the UK along the Nile to Johannesburg between 1948 and 1950 BOAC DC-4M-4 Argonaut G-ALHS \\"Astra\\" at London Airport (Heathrow) in September 1954 The sole C-69C after civilianisation for BOAC as a Lockheed 049E at Heathrow Airport in 1954 At the end of the war, BOAC's fleet consisted of Lockheed Lodestars, lend-lease Douglas DC-3s, Liberators, converted Sunderlands, and the first Avro Lancastrians, Avro Yorks, and Handley Page Haltons. The Short Empire, Short S.26 and Boeing 314A flying boats, plus the AW Ensigns, were due to be withdrawn. The corporation's aircraft, bases and personnel were scattered around the world, and it took a decade to reorganise it into an efficient unit at Heathrow. In 1943, the Brabazon Committee had laid down a set of civil aircraft transport types for the British aircraft industry to produce, but these were to be several years in coming, and particularly in the case of the tailwheel Avro Tudor, not what BOAC wanted. Since 1941, the advanced pressurised Lockheed Constellation had been under development, and in 1946 BOAC was permitted to use dollars to purchase an initial fleet of five for the prestigious North Atlantic route (there were no equivalent British types available). Throughout the whole of BOAC's existence, the argument over buying American or (often delayed) British products continued, and Parliament, the press, British manufacturers and the unions accused BOAC management of only wanting American aircraft. Whilst the major world airlines abandoned flying-boats at the end of WWII, BOAC continued with theirs until 1950, and even introduced the new Short Solent on the leisurely Nile route to South Africa. In 1948, the unpressurised Yorks were still operating passenger services as far afield as Nairobi (Kenya), Accra (Gold Coast, later Ghana), Delhi and Calcutta (India), and the type continued to operate freight schedules until late 1957.Jackson, 1990, p. 379. After its first six Lockheed 049 Constellations, BOAC had to use some ingenuity to increase its Constellation fleet. In 1947, Aerlínte Éireann in Ireland bought five new Lockheed 749 Constellations, and prepared to launch a transatlantic service with assistance and crew-training from Captains O. P. Jones and J. C. Kelly-Rogers of BOAC. The project was abandoned in February 1948, and BOAC were able to buy the almost new 749s without dollar expenditure four months later. This enabled BOAC to serve Australia with Constellations from 1949. A total of 25 Constellations passed through the BOAC fleet, including 12 749As obtained from Capital Airlines in the mid-1950s, with BOAC's older 049s in part exchange. BOAC was also permitted to spend dollars on six new Boeing 377 Stratocruisers for its key transatlantic routes from October 1949, offering a double-deck non-stop eastbound service from New York City to London Airport (later Heathrow). However, because of the prevailing westerly winds, the westbound flights needed re-fuelling at Shannon and Gander before reaching New York. Another four Stratocruisers were taken over from a frustrated SAS order and seven were bought secondhand in the mid-1950s. The Handley Page Hermes and Canadair DC-4M Argonaut joined the BOAC fleet between 1949 and 1950, replacing the last of the non-pressurised types on passenger services. When service entry of the Bristol Britannia was delayed in late 1956, BOAC was permitted to purchase ten new Douglas DC-7Cs. These long-range aircraft enabled BOAC to operate non-stop westbound flights from London and Manchester to New York and other US East Coast destinations, in competition with DC-7Cs of Pan Am and Lockheed Super Constellations of Trans World Airlines (TWA). This was the first purchase of aircraft direct from the Douglas Aircraft Company in BOAC's history. Introduction of jets Comet 1 at Heathrow in 1953 BOAC Comet 4 in 1963 In May 1952 BOAC was the first airline to introduce a passenger jet into airline service. This was the de Havilland Comet which flew via Nairobi to Johannesburg and via the Far East to Tokyo. All Comet 1 aircraft were grounded in April 1954 after four Comets crashed, the second last being a BOAC aircraft at altitude. Examination of the wreckage recovered from the Mediterranean sea-bed and observation of a sample fuselage in a pressurisation test-tank at Farnborough revealed that the repeated pressurisation / depressurisation cycles of airline operation could cause fatigue cracks in the thin aluminium alloy skin of the Comet leading to the skins ripping away explosively at altitude and disintegration of the aircraft. Later jet airliners including the revised Comet 4 were designed to be fail-safe: in the event of, for example, a skin-failure due to cracking the damage would be localised and not catastrophic. In October 1958 BOAC operated the first transatlantic jet service with the larger and longer-range Comet 4. In the 1950s turbine powered airliners were developing rapidly, and the Comet and the seriously delayed Bristol Britannia were soon rendered obsolescent by the flight of the swept-wing Boeing 367–80 (707 prototype) in 1954. In 1953 Vickers had started building the swept wing VC-7/V-1000 with Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan engines, but BOAC short-sightedly decided the Britannia and Comet 4 would be adequate for its purposes, and when the military version of the V-1000 was cancelled in 1955 the 75% complete prototype was scrapped. In October 1956 BOAC ordered 15 Boeing 707s with Conway engines (briefly the most economical commercial engine option). They entered service in 1960. (The British airworthiness authorities insisted on tail-fin modifications which Boeing made available to all 707 users.) Sir Giles Guthrie, who took charge of BOAC in 1964, preferred Boeing aircraft for economic reasons, and indeed BOAC began turning a profit in the late 1960s. After a row in Parliament the government instructed BOAC to purchase 17 Vickers VC10 aircraft from a 30-aircraft order which Guthrie had cancelled. The Standard VC10 had higher operating costs than the 707, largely due to BOAC's requirement at the design stage for the aircraft to have excellent hot and high performance for Commonwealth (African/Asian) routes, but the larger Super VC10 was a success with American passengers on the North Atlantic and was profitable. Boeing 747-100 landing at Heathrow Airport in September 1972 The next major order of Boeing aircraft was for 11 Boeing 747-100s. On 22 April 1970 BOAC received its first 747, but the aircraft did not enter commercial service until 14 April 1971 due to BOAC's inability to settle crewing and pay rates with the British Air Line Pilots' Association. BOAC's successor British Airways later became the largest Boeing customer outside North America. Merger with BEA The first attempt at a merger of BOAC with BEA arose in 1953 out of inconclusive attempts between the two airlines to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. The chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the Middle East, and he had backing for his proposal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve Ankara in Turkey, and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. Paradoxically, through its effective control of Cyprus Airways, BEA was able to continue to serve destinations ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy. However, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, combining BEA and BOAC, was constituted on 1 April 1972. This event coincided with the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority, the UK's new, unified regulator for the air transport industry. BOAC would have become one of the first operators of the Concorde, had it not merged to become British Airways. BA's Concordes carried registrations of G-BOAA to G-BOAG. The first Concorde delivered to British Airways was registered G-BOAC. Other BOAC companies BOAC Associated Companies BOAC held shareholdings in a number of other airlines operating in several parts of the British Commonwealth through a subsidiary, BOAC Associated Companies. These included Aden Airways, Bahamas Airways, Fiji Airways,Qantas Expansion Australian Transport September 1968 page 43 Ghana Airways, Gulf Aviation and Nigeria Airways. In the late 1950s BOAC Associated Companies was declared to have holdings in eighteen companies. BOAC-Cunard Ltd Super VC10 In 1962, BOAC and Cunard formed BOAC-Cunard Ltd to operate scheduled services to North America, the Caribbean and South America. BOAC provided 70% of the new company's capital and eight Boeing 707s. The independent Cunard Eagle Airways, of which Cunard held a 60% shareholding, provided two more 707s. BOAC-Cunard leased any spare capacity to BOAC which could use it to supplement the main BOAC fleet at peak demand, and in a reciprocal arrangement BOAC would provide capacity to BOAC-Cunard on some operations when it had a shortfall. The effect of this arrangement was to remove competition on western routes.\\"Towards a British Aeroflot\\" Flight International 12 March 1970. The operation was dissolved in 1966.

Incidents and accidents 1940s * On 22 April 1940, Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra G-AKFD Loch Invar crashed 10 miles off course at Beinn Uird, near Loch Lomond, Scotland, killing the three crew. * On 23 May 1940, Armstrong Whitworth Ensign G-ADSZ Elysean stalled and crashed at Merville Airport after the crew diverted to avoid an attack by a German fighter. *On 23 May 1940, Armstrong Whitworth Ensign G-ADTA Euryalus was damaged during a crash at RAF Lympne. It had been one of six that escaped a Luftwaffe raid on Merville Airfield, France. The intended destination was Croydon. Approaching the English coast, first she lost her port inner engine and the pilot diverted to RAF Hawkinge. Her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down shortly afterwards. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage failed to lock down, causing the wing to drag on the ground and the aircraft to go through a fence. Euryalus was flown to RAF Hamble in June, but it was decided to cannibalise her to repair G-ADSU Euterpe which had been damaged in an accident at Bonnington on 15 December 1939. Euryalus was scrapped in September 1942. (p203 , p204 , p205 , p206 ). * On 1 September 1941, Consolidated Liberator C I AM915 crashed into a hill outside Campbeltown, Argyll, after a flight from Montreal, killing all four crew and six passengers. * On 29 December 1941, Short Empire G-ADUX Cassiopeia crashed after striking debris on takeoff from Sabang, Indonesia, killing four. * On 30 January 1942, Short Empire G-AEUH Corio was shot down by seven Japanese fighter aircraft and crashed off West Timor, killing 13 of 18 on board. The aircraft was owned by BOAC, but was operated by Qantas. * On 15 February 1942, Consolidated Liberator C I G-AGDR was shot down by a Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire in error over the English Channel near Plymouth, England. All five crew and four passengers (including Townsend Griffiss) were killed. The RAF increased aircraft reconnaissance training in response to this incident. * On 28 February 1942, Short Empire G-AETZ Circe was shot down over the Pacific between Cilacap and Broome by a Japanese fighter, killing all 22 on board. This crash is the worst ever accident involving the Short Empire. The aircraft was operating for Qantas. * On 22 March 1942, Short Empire G-AEUF struck debris while landing and crashed at Port Darwin, Australia, killing two of 11 passengers on board; all four crew survived. * On 24 September 1942, Short Empire G-AFCZ Clare broke up and sank following a forced landing in the Atlantic off Senegal due to engine failure; all 19 on board died. * On 9 January 1943, Short S.26 G-AFCK Golden Horn crashed in the Tagus River near Lisbon while attempting an emergency landing due to an in-flight fire, killing 13 of 15 on board. The aircraft was on a test flight following replacement of an engine. * On 15 February 1943, de Havilland Flamingo G-AFYE crashed at Asmara, Eritrea after going into a vertical dive from during a test flight, killing both pilots. * On 23 March 1943, Consolidated PBY Catalina G-AGDA Dog- Able crashed on landing at Poole Harbor during a training flight, killing three of six on board. * On 4 April 1943, Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar (C-56B) G-AGEJ was possibly shot down by a Junkers Ju 88 of Luftwaffe 10/NJG 3 and crashed 31 mi off Skagen, Denmark, killing all seven on board. * On 1 June 1943, Flight 777, a Douglas DC-3 G-AGBB was shot down over the Bay of Biscay by eight German Junkers Ju 88s of KG 40. All seventeen crew and passengers were killed, including actor Leslie Howard. There has been widespread speculation that the downing was an attempt to kill British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The aircraft was owned and operated by KLM, flying for BOAC. * On 16 June 1943, Lockheed Hudson IV FK459 stalled and crashed while turning for approach to Khartoum Civil Airport due to fuel starvation and engine failure, killing all 17 on board.

The aircraft had taken off from Tripoli, Libya, with the intended destination of Kano, Nigeria. All on board survived, but the first officer died of heat stroke five days later while awaiting rescue. * On 26 Oktober 1952, DH Comet 1 G-ALYZ, the first Comet taken into service only the month before, crashed on take off at Ciampino Airport, Rome.There were no casualties and Italian investigators concluded pilot error as cause of this crash. The investigators found scrapes on the runway for over 650 yards, combined with the pilot report of not getting speed up after rotation and referencing the BOAC Comet manual which stated : \\"at 80 knots the nose should be raised until the rumble of the nose- wheel ceases. Care should be taken not to over do this and adopt adopt an exaggerated tail down attitude with consequent poor acceleration\\". The conclusion was made: \\"An error of judgement by the captain in not appreciating the excessive nose up attitude of the Aircraft during take off\\".https://www.amazon.com/Comet-Worlds-First-Jet-Airliner/dp/1781592799 * On 2 May 1953, Flight 783/057, a de Havilland Comet I G-ALYV crashed 25 miles north-west of Calcutta, India, after suffering structural failure while climbing through 7,500 ft in a severe storm. The crash occurred shortly after take-off from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport (then known as Dum Dum Airport) on a flight to Delhi, and killed all 43 passengers and crew on board. * On 10 January 1954, Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet I, G-ALYP, took off from Ciampino Airport in Rome, Italy, en route to Heathrow Airport in London, England; as it was reaching cruising altitude it suffered an explosive decompression and crashed into the Tyrrhenian Sea near Elba, killing all 35 on board. * On 13 March 1954, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, G-ALAM, crashed at Kallang Airport, Singapore, when it landed short and struck a sea wall after a flight from Jakarta, killing 33 people out of 40 passengers and crew on board. Pilot fatigue was cited as a contributing cause, and inadequate rescue services were implicitly blamed for some of the fatalities. * On 8 April 1954, de Havilland Comet I G-ALYY was operating South African Airways Flight 201 at night when it suffered what was almost certainly an explosive decompression at altitude and crashed into the sea near the island of Stromboli, off the Italian coast near Naples. The wreckage was never recovered, but all known evidence pointed to a repeat of the recent accident to G-ALYP. The aircraft was operating for South African Airways on charter from BOAC, with an SAA crew. * Early on Christmas Day 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a BOAC Boeing 377 Stratocruiser G-ALSA crashed on landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft was en route from London to New York when, on approach to an intermediate stop at Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. The crash was attributed to a number of factors, including pilot fatigue (the captain was well over his duty limit due to the flight being delayed), the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which may have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall. * On 21 September 1955, Canadair Argonaut G-ALHL crashed during a storm at Tripoli International Airport after a flight from London and Rome. The aircraft, which was making its fourth attempt to land in the severe weather conditions, struck trees short of the runway. The accident and ensuing fire killed 15 passengers and crew out of 47 people on board. * On 24 June 1956, Canadair Argonaut G-ALHE crashed after taking off from Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport on a flight to Tripoli International Airport. The aircraft had reached 200 ft when it encountered a microburst, causing an abrupt loss of speed and altitude. With the Argonaut barely 20 ft above the ground the captain regained control, but too late to avoid colliding with a large baobab tree. The crash killed 32 passengers and crew out of 45 people on board. * On 24 December 1958, a Bristol Britannia 312 G-AOVD crashed during a test flight near Winkton, England, killing nine of 12 on board. 1960s * On 5 March 1966, Flight 911, a Boeing 707 G-APFE, crashed on Mount Fuji after experiencing clear air turbulence. All 124 on board died. * On 9 April 1968, Flight 712 a Rolls-Royce Conway engine exploded and broke off from the wing of a Boeing 707 G-ARWE (\\"Whisky-Echo\\") following take-off from London Heathrow Airport causing an uncontained wing fire. A successful emergency landing at Heathrow was carried out, but a stewardess and four passengers were killed and 38 other passengers were injured as the fire spread during evacuation. The stewardess, Barbara Jane Harrison, was awarded a posthumous George Cross for her part in helping passengers escape. 1970s * On 9 September 1970, Flight 775, operated by Vickers VC10 G-ASGN, became the first British plane to be hijacked as part of the Dawson's Field hijackings. * In the early hours of 22 July 1971, BOAC Flight 045 from London to Khartoum was ordered by air control in Malta (and allegedly forced to obey the order by Libyan military jets) to land at Benghazi at 3.30 am. Sudanese rebel leader Babiker El Nur, announced as President a week before in a political coup, and his companion Major Farouk Hamadallah, were instructed to leave the aircraft, or the fighter planes would bomb it. El Nur quickly agreed to leave, in order to save the lives of the other passengers. He and Hamadallah were quickly taken off the aircraft to be held at gunpoint. Despite strong British government protests to the Sudan about the outrage, and an appeal to President Numairy for clemency, the men were both executed within a week. * On 3 August 1971, BOAC Flight 600, operated by a Boeing 747 from Montreal to London, was diverted to Denver, Colorado due to a bomb hoax inspired by a TV film Doomsday Flight. The aircraft travelled 3,200 miles out of its way to land in Denver. The supposed bomb was thought to be triggered by flying below 5,000 feet. Denver's airport was above 5,000 feet. Non-fatal accidents 1940s * On 14 September 1940, Short Scylla G-ACJJ Scylla was destroyed in a windstorm while parked at RAF Drem, Scotland. * On 6 October 1940, de Havilland Albatross G-AFDL Fingal crashed at Pucklechurch, Gloucestershire during a ferry flight; all three on board survived. * On 24 November 1940, Douglas DC-3 G-AGBI and Armstrong Whitworth Ensign II G-ADTC were destroyed on the ground at Whitchurch Airfield during a German daylight bombing raid. * On 20 December 1940, de Havilland Albatross G-AFDI Frobisher was destroyed on the ground by a German air raid while parked at Whitchurch Airfield. * On 15 February 1941, Short Empire G-AFCX Clyde was wrecked in a gale at Lisbon, Portugal. * On 23 June 1942, Lockheed Hudson III G-AGDF ditched in the Gullmarsfjorden off Skredewick, Sweden after one engine failed and the other caught fire; all 10 on board survived. * On 16 July 1943, de Havilland Albatross G-AFDK Fortuna crashed while on approach to Shannon Airport due to wing failure; all 14 on board survived. * On 21 April 1944, Douglas C-47 G-AGFZ was written off following a landing accident at Bromma Airport; the aircraft was sold to AB Aerotransport for spare parts. * On 2 May 1945, Lockheed C-60A G-AGLI ditched in the Baltic Sea in Sikeåfjärden off Västerbotten, Sweden after the crew became disorientated; all nine on board survived and were rescued by locals. 1950s * On 26 October 1952, de Havilland Comet 1A G-ALYZ failed to gain altitude and crashed on takeoff from Ciampino Airport due to pilot error; all 43 on board survived, but the aircraft was written off, resulting in the first hull-loss of the Comet. * On 25 July 1953, de Havilland Comet 1 G-ALYR experienced a runway excursion while taxiing at Dum Dum Airport. While taxiing, the crew used the landing lights because the taxi lights were too dim. In a left turn while alternating between the left and right lights, the pilot took his hand off the steering wheel, causing the steering to center. The right side main landing gear left the runway; right side engine power was increased and this caused the landing gear to be forced up into the wing, causing severe damage. All 42 on board survived; the aircraft was written off. 1960s * On 14 March 1960, de Havilland Comet 4 G-APDS struck a ridge while on approach to Barajas Airport, tearing off the landing gear wheels and port side wing fuel tank and damaging the port wing flaps. The pilot abandoned the approach and performed an emergency landing with the damaged gear down. All 32 on board survived and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The aircraft was flying too low during the approach. * On 22 August 1960, de Havilland Comet 4 G-APDB took off from a runway at Cairo International Airport that was under construction. The port side main landing gear fell into a hole, breaking off the axles and wheels; all 60 on board survived and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. * On 24 December 1960, Boeing 707-436 G-APFN overran the runway on landing at Heathrow Airport; all 106 on board survived and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The aircraft had come in too fast and landed too far down the runway as a result. * On 9 March 1964, de Havilland Comet 4 G-APDN suffered a tailstrike while landing at Mehrabad Airport, damaging the underside of the fuselage and control of the elevators was lost, but the aircraft continued the landing without further incident. All 57 on board survived. In popular culture The Beatles song \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" references a flight from Miami Beach aboard a BOAC aircraft. It is referenced in the James Tiptree, Jr. story \\"The Last Flight of Dr. Ain.\\" In The Sopranos, Season 6 Episode 19 “The Second Coming\\" Paulie Walnuts claims he was dosed with acid when a BOAC stewardess put it in his drink in 1968.

Biography  Hossein belonged to the Shamlu tribe, one of the seven Turkoman tribes of the Qizilbash, a Shia militant group, which supported the young Safaviyya leader Ismail I, who had taken refuge in Gilan to avoid the Aq Qoyunlu, a Turkic tribal federation which controlled most of Iran. During Ismail's stay in Gilan, Hossein Beg served as his guardian and mentor. In 1500, Ismail came out of hiding and with the aid of the Qizilbash, invaded Shirvan, killing its ruler Farrukh Yassar. In 1501, all of Shirvan, Arran and Azerbaijan was under the control of Ismail, who laid foundation to the Safavid dynasty. He then appointed Hossein Beg as the vakil of the empire and the commander-in-chief (amir al-umara) of the Qizilbash army. By 1504, all of present-day Iran was under the control of Ismail. In 1507, Hossein Beg campaigned in western Iran, where he was ambushed by a group of Kurds and as a result lost 300 men. During the same year, Ismail appointed the Iranian Mir Najm Zargar Gilani as the new vakil. One year later, an Safavid army under Hossein Beg and Ismail captured Baghdad. In 1509/10, Hossein Beg lost his office as commander-in-chief in favor to a man of humble origins, Muhammad Beg Ustajlu. In 1512, Hossein Beg, along with the rest of the Qizilbash commanders, betrayed the Safavid vakil Najm-e Sani and left him to die at the Battle of Ghazdewan. Hossein Beg later took part in the Ismail's war against the Ottomans, but was killed at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.

This resulted in the death of 21 insurgents who attempted to escape leaving 2 security personnel severely injured. Incident The incident occurred on Sunday 31 March 2014 in the morning, when one of the service suspect handler went to the detention to serve their breakfast. In a bid to return to his office, he was disarmed by one of the insurgents who hit him on the head with his handcuff in an attempt to escape. This incessant action drew the attention of the armed guards who shot in the air to stop them. This effort was futile until the army officers came in to suppress the uprising. Twenty-one prisoners were killed by the military personnel and two government officials were seriously injured. Reactions After the attack, there was a controversy over the death of the 21 prisoners who died in the process of the attack, because some innocent prisoners might have been killed by the soldiers who labeled them as Boko haram. This assumption was based on the New York Times publications of the Amnesty International report that alleges malicious killing of about 600 unarmed, rearrested escapees who had been earlier freed when Boko haram attacked the Giwa military barracks in Maiduguri. The Amnesty International report was based on an eye-witness account of the Nigerian soldiers' killing of the innocent rearrested prisoners that was freed by Boko haram during the Giwa military barracks attack. The eye-witness said: \\"The former detainees were in a classroom. They started screaming 'we are not Boko Haram. We are detainees!’ My neighbours and I saw the soldiers take the men to a place called 'no man's land,’ behind the University of Maiduguri. We watched as the soldiers opened fire killing all 56. They were killed in front of us. All of them\\", according to the New York Times.

The club then managed to stay within the first two places of the table. On 29 December Big Game 5 proved to be a success with a 26–15 win over London Irish before a capacity crowd (82,000) at Twickenham Stadium. Later in the season the second setback came in the return game against Exeter when the Chiefs managed a 16–27 defeat of the Harlequins at The Stoop.

In 1902, the property was purchased by the antiquarian Napoleone Brianzi of Milan. He prevented the sale of two of the frescoed ceilings, and attempted to restore the palace, adding period furniture from other properties. After 1937, it was bought by A. Feltrinelli and L. Bonomi, who struggled to maintain the property. In 1988, the palace became the host of the Museum of the Comune of Chiavenna. They have sought to maintain the villa and the surrounding vinyards.

In the course of its history it underwent a series of reconstructions and renovations until it was definitively destroyed by a fire in 1863. In their 18th-century heyday, the Teatro delle Dame and its rival, the Teatro Capranica, were the leading opera houses in Rome and saw many world premieres performed by some of the most prominent singers of the time. History The theatre was built by Antonio D'Alibert for the performance of opera seria. It was a project long planned by his father Jacques D'Alibert (1626–1713) who had been the secretary to Queen Christina of Sweden and had managed the Teatro Tordinona. The Teatro Tordinona was Rome's first public theatre but was demolished in 1697 on the orders of Pope Innocent XII who considered public theatres a corrupting influence on the populace. Floor plan of the theatre in 1761 The Teatro Alibert (as it was then called) was constructed in wood on a piece of land formerly used for playing pallacorda (a game similar to real tennis). According to the Italian theatre historian Saverio Franchi, the architect supervising the construction was probably Matteo Sassi (1646–1723).Franchi, Saverio (1997). Drammaturgia romana, Vol. 2, pp. xxvii; xlviii. Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura When it was inaugurated in 1718 with the premiere of Francesco Mancini's opera Alessandro Severo, the Teatro Alibert was the largest theatre in Rome with seven tiers of 32 boxes each. In 1720 Francesco Galli Bibiena enlarged and redesigned the interior, reshaping the auditorium into a \\"phonetic curve\\" (midway between a rectangle and a horseshoe).Nicassio, Susan Vandiver (2002). Tosca's Rome: The Play and the Opera in Historical Perspective, pp. 81–82. University of Chicago PressLynn, Karyl Charna (2005). Italian Opera Houses and Festivals, p. 241. Scarecrow Press The theatre was an artistic success but not a financial one. Matters were not helped by the Jubilee Year of 1725 when all Roman theatres were closed for the duration. Antonio D'Alibert went bankrupt and the Roman authorities put the theatre up for auction in 1726. It was bought by a consortium of Roman nobility and renamed the Teatro delle Dame. The theatre's management eventually passed to the Knights of Malta, with whom some members of the consortium had close links. The order was to maintain control of the theatre until well into the 19th century.Markstrom, Kurt Sven (2007). The Operas of Leonardo Vinci, Napoletano, pp. 137–138. Pendragon Press In the mid-1730s, the building underwent extensive renovation and embellishment designed by the architect Ferdinando Fuga and reopened in 1738 with a performance of Nicola Logroscino's opera Quinto Fabio. By the 19th century, the Teatro delle Dame (like its rival the Teatro Capranica) had ceased being a leading opera house in the city. Operas were still performed there, but it was increasingly used for public balls, acrobatic shows, and plays written in the local Roman dialect. Prince Alessandro Torlonia acquired the theatre in 1847 and had it reconstructed in brick with an even larger stage which could accommodate equestrian shows. On the night of 15 February 1863, the theatre caught fire yet again and was completely destroyed. Later, an inn known as the Locanda Alibert was constructed on the site. In the early 2000s the Locanda Alibert building was completely restructured and turned into a congress and event centre.Costantini, Emilia (14 December 2005). \\"Riapre il Teatro delle Dame.

Opera premieres Teresa Bertinotti, the first woman to sing at the Teatro delle Dame Throughout most of the 18th century, women were forbidden to perform on stage in the Papal States. During that period operas were sung at the Teatro delle Dame by all-male casts with castrati singing the female roles. Amongst the famous castrato singers to appear there were Farinelli, Giacinto Fontana (\\"Farfallino\\"), Giovanni Carestini, and Luigi Marchesi. From 1798 when Rome came under French rule, women began appearing on the theatre's stage—the first one was the soprano Teresa Bertinotti.

History  The oldest squadron of the Indian Navy, this was the unit where Naval Aviation was born, where it all began, and from where it grew and spread its wings to touch the skies. The Navy's first Fleet Requirement Unit (FRU), comprising two Sealands and manned by five pilots and two observers, was commissioned on 11 May 1953 at Venduruthy II, Kochi. Lt Cdr Y N Singh was the commissioning Squadron Commander. The FRU was recommissioned as INAS 550 on 15 June 1959 under the command of Lt Cdr Y N Singh. In February 1954, the squadron acquired two Firefly aircraft. The squadron had its first moment of glory on 21 April 1954 when six aircraft, in batches of two, escorted SS Gothic from Colombo to Aden with Her Highness, Queen Elizabeth on board. In October 1956, HT-2 aircraft were inducted and the squadron was split up into INAS 550 A (Naval Jet Flt) at Sulur and the INAS 550-B Flt at Kochi. In 1976, the squadron was equipped with Islander aircraft and HPT-32 aircraft were inducted in January 1986. In October 1987, the squadron completed basic flying training on the HPT-32 for the first batch of 6 naval pilots. However, the practice was discontinued and the squadron ceased further basic flying training on the HPTs. In December 1987 also saw the squadron being tasked for sorties in support of the IPKF operations in Sri Lanka. Through the late eighties and the nineties the squadron did extensive flying towards Observer training, maritime reconnaissance and patrol missions. In the late nineties a few of the piston-engine Britton Norman Islander (BN 2B) aircraft were upgraded to turbo-prop engines (BN 2T), and the squadron also acquired its first Dornier aircraft. The present day 550 continues to be a squadron that puts in extensive flying effort towards maritime reconnaissance, patrol and Observer training. On 16 March 2018, 2 Pipistrel Virus, locally termed Garud, were inducted into the squadron.

Based in Avaldsnes in Karmøy, Norway, the airline used a mix of aircraft to operate scheduled and charter flights. It was started at the time of Haugesund Airport opening and commenced a taxi route service to Bergen and Stavanger, at first using the Piper PA-31 Chieftain and a Beechcraft 99 Queenliner. A service from Stavanger via Farsund to Kristiansand was introduced in 1980. Larger Britten-Norman Islander and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner were used for charter flights, the latter also used on scheduled services from 1981. Norving bought the airline that year. Nordsjøfly never made a profit and was liquidated in 1983. Norving continued to carry on the scheduled services itself until 1987. History Nordsjøfly was incorporated on 9 April 1975, with one employee and operating one aircraft,Reitan: 38 a Cessna 402.Hagby: 94 It was based at Haugesund Airport, Karmøy, which opened the previous day.Reitan: 27 Nordsjøfly was one of two airlines established at the airport that year, the other being Coast Aero Center. For charter and general aviation operations the airline procured a Piper PA-31 Chieftain.Hagby: 288 The airline received a concession on 12 February 1976 to operate a taxi route connecting Haugesund to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. This had the advantage of the airline being allowed to operate more flexibly and could cancel flights with few passengers. On the other hand, it could only operate aircraft with up to ten passengers.Reitan: 40 The routes commenced on 5 March 1977 with three daily flights to Bergen and two to Stavanger.Reitan: 44 The regular concession for the route was granted to Braathens SAFE, but they chose not to execute it, allowing for a smaller airline to operate an interim service.Reitan: 60 For these route as well as charter the airline bought a Beechcraft 99 Queenliner and a Britten-Norman Islander.Hagby: 289Hagby: 290 Operations of the route proved to be unprofitable. In 1977 the airline flew 12,000 passengers, but Nordsjøfly lost one million Norwegian krone in losses.Reitan: 53 Construction of a combined hangar and office building commenced in 1978.Reitan: 47 Nordsjøfly lost three million krone in 1979. The shipping company Normand increased its ownership in Nordsjøfly bought a quarter of the company that year. A major charter contract was signed with oil company Ameco in 1980 to fly its employees from Bergen and Stavanger to Aberdeen Airport. Nordsjøfly therefore bought a 19-passenger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner to carry out the job.Reitan: 55 Braathens SAFE withdrew from their services to Farsund Airport, Lista in 1980. Both Nordsjøfly and Norving applied to operate the route, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications awarded the concession to Nordsjøfly.Melling: 171 The route from Haugesund via Stavanger to Farsund and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik commenced on 3 November.Reitan: 56 The airline had 11,801 passengers on the Bergen to Haugesund route in 1980, and 15,000 charter passengers. Revenue hit 12 million krone that year.Reitan: 57 By then the airline had bought a wide array of smaller aircraft, including a Beechcraft King Air, a Beechcraft 95 Travel Air and two Queenliners.Hagby: 230 This forced high maintenance and operations costs due to lack of commonality. The airline therefore initiated a program to streamline its operations with fewer aircraft classes. Norving bought eighty percent of Nordsjøfly on 31 July 1981.Reitan: 58 The airline applied the ministry for a regular scheduled concession, which would allow it to use larger aircraft on the routes to Stavanger and Bergen. Rogaland County Municipality opposed the application, stating that it could have a negative impact on the ferry service from Stavanger via Haugesund to Bergen. The ministry granted Nordsjøfly the right to use Braathens' concession. The airline therefore started using its Metroliner on the Bergen and Stavanger routes.Reitan: 61 It also made an interlining agreement with KLM which allowed passengers to fly from Haugesund via Stavanger to Amsterdam for the same prices as from Stavanger. A similar agreement was made with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) the following year, allowing Nordsjøfly to ferry passengers via Stavanger for flights onwards to Aberdeen, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Glasgow and London.Reitan: 65 Norving announced the liquidation of Nordsjøfly in 1982. Losses since the inception in 1975 and lack of commonalities within operations meant that Norving only wanted to keep the scheduled services and abolish the operating base at Haugesund.Reitan: 66 Braathens SAFE announced that they intended that their regional affiliate Busy Bee should take over the route, while Widerøe also announced an interest in operating the services. Busy Bee started the route in 1984 in competition with Norving.Melling: 223 The latter retained its operations out of Haugesund until November 1987, when the base was closed.Melling: 282 Fleet The following is a list of aircraft operated by Nordsjøfly.

History  In its early form the squadron existed as the Naval Jet Flight (NJF) at Sulur, which was set up in September 1957 and was equipped with four Vampire aircraft. The first Flight Commander was Lt Cdr BD Law. In June 1959 the Naval Jet Flight was reconstituted as INAS 550 A. The third Flt Cdr of the NJF, Lt Raj Anderson became the first Squadron Commander of INAS 550 A, redesignated and commissioned as INAS 551 on 5 September 1961. A year later Sea Hawks from INAS 300 were also inducted into the squadron. The role of the squadron was to train pilots towards tactical flying and air combat on the Vampire. Before the pilots left for INAS 300, they were converted on Sea Hawks. The squadron was, thus, a feeder squadron for fighter pilots into naval aviation. The squadron inducted Kiran Mk I in 1970 and commenced fighter training on these aircraft. An advanced version of the Kiran, the Kiran Mk II was inducted in 1986. In 1990, the Sea Harrier Operational Flying Training Unit was set up and INAS 551 was bifurcated into two flights. INAS 551 A operated the Kirans and INAS 551 B operated the Sea Harriers, undertaking conversion onto the aircraft for pilots joining INAS 300. In May 2003, the squadron added another feather to its cap, when it set up a naval aerobatic team, the Sagar Pawan, operating Kiran Mk II jets. The Indian Navy, thus, became only the second navy in the world after the US Navy to have an active fixed wing aerobatic team. The squadron conducts Naval Orientation Courses for pilots before they progress onto the Sea Harrier and the MiG-29K aircraft. Pre Qualified Flying Instructor Course training is also conducted for Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard pilots. The squadron continues to fulfill its role of training naval fighter pilots till date.

He was a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the New York Academy of Sciences. Early life Singer was born in New York City on February 6, 1924. He was educated at the City College of New York and at the University of Pennsylvania where he obtained his PhD in 1951. He was enlisted in the United States Army where he served as a staff sergeant from 1943 through 1946. In the Army, he worked in counter intelligence, serving in the Philippines, New Guinea, and Japan. Career In 1963, he was recruited as a full professor and director of the clinical psychology training program for the City University of New York. Singer became considered \\"the father of daydreaming\\" and he \\"has laid the foundations for virtually all current investigations of the costs and benefits of daydreaming and mind-wandering\\". To study daydreaming, Singer and co-worker John S. Antrobus of the City University of New York developed a questionnaire designed to measure the various dimensions that characterize the individual's inner life. They called this instrument the Imaginal Process Inventory (IPI). Singer and co-workers described the IPI: > The 28 subscales of this self-report measure of ongoing thought > predisposition attempt to sample various domains of mentation style (such as > propensity for boredom or distractibility, rate of mentation, degree of > visual or auditory imagery during daydreaming), orientation toward > daydreaming more generally (for example, the degree to which an individual > can become totally absorbed in fantasy activity, the degree to which > daydreaming is accepted as relatively \\"normal and even desirable\\"), and > specific fantasy patterns (such as sexual content, hostile-aggressive > content, or fantasies of guilt). Singer and his co-workers studied several aspects of daydreaming, including childhood development and daydreams, the psychotherapeutic use of daydreams, and drug use and daydreaming. He worked in close partnership with his wife, Dorothy. They co-directed the Yale University Family Television Research and Consultation Center, which provided consultation to many influential children's television programs, including Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and Barney & Friends.

It was produced until at least 1915. Description The objective of the game was to throw a wooden ball into a bullseye, the \\"gaping mouth\\" of the target in cardboard decorated using imagery of Sambo and that could open and close. It was one of many products and media of late 19th century in the United States depicting African Americans as \\"beasts\\" and associating the black male face Sambo images with racial slur terms such as \\"coon\\", \\"darky\\", \\"nigger\\", and \\"pickaninny\\". Among these was another Milton Bradley game, Darky's Coon Game. The term \\"darkie\\" referred to the \\"exaggerated physiognomic features\\" depicting black people and associated with minstrel shows. In the book Ceramic Uncles & Celluloid Mammies: Black Images and Their Influence on Culture, Patricia Turner reported that she had heard of a black man sitting outside a theatre preceding a minstrel show, with his mouth open and children throwing balls into it for entertainment. The Cuban poet and journalist José Martí witnessed a similar scene at Coney Island and wrote about it. It was one of many games produced at the time with a theme involving violence against black people, who were \\"encountering growing hostility\\" throughout the United States. Another was \\"Hit the Dodger! Knock him Out!\\". It was also one of the objects produced at the time featuring a mouth and \\"black ingestion\\" as a stereotype of African Americans, such as the watermelon stereotype, also exemplified by the \\"Jolly Nigger Bank\\" into which coins are inserted into a mouth-shaped slot. The target consumer for the game was white people, who bought it for their children. These games and images reinforced \\"an encompassing theme of domination\\" by white people and subordination of black people. Turner states that such products reflected means by which \\"American consumers found acceptable ways of buying and selling the souls of black folk\\" even after the abolition of slavery in the United States, and the use of black images in advertising \\"figured prominently in commodity capitalism\\". Today, the game is considered a collector's item. It is part of collectable black memorabilia, consisting of objects such as dolls, toys, and postcards that include those that are offensive or racist, even the \\"most contemptible examples\\" of such works. By 1993, there were about 50,000 black memorabilia collectors in the United States, about 70% of whom were African Americans.

She was, together with Peter Rivière, one of the pioneers of Amazonian anthropology at the University of Oxford. Part of the permanent endowment of the University of Oxford is a fund to support South American Amerindian Studies known as the Butt Colson Amerindian Studies Bequest. University Acts, Oxford University Gazette, 14 July 2005. Oxford University Audrey Butt studied at Oxford under Edward Evans-Pritchard, and carried out fieldwork among the Akawaio people in Guyana in 1951-1952 and in 1957, later broadening her study to include other Pemon and Kapon groups in Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. She obtained the Diploma in Ethnology in 1949, the B.Litt. degree in 1950, and the D.Phil. in 1955. She then spent a year in Spain to learn Spanish in preparation for further fieldwork in South America. In 1956 she lectured on South American societies at Oxford's Department of Ethnology. Pitt Rivers Museum The South American collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum contain 310 Amerindian objects donated by Butt Colson as a result of her fieldwork. The museum also holds two reels of 16mm film shot by Bassett Maguire in 1952 and a BBC recording of Akawaio music and songs made in 1961, all produced with Butt Colson's assistance. Amerindian land disputes In 2012 a judge in the Demerara High Court ruled that Dr Colson could not appear as an expert witness in a land suit brought by Akawaio and Arekuna Amerindian communities because of her prior support of the plaintiffs' position. In September 2013 Survival International published her report, Dug out, dried out or flooded out? Hydro Power and Mining Threats to the Indigenous Peoples of the Upper Mazaruni District, Guyana, demonstrating that the government of Guyana's plans to build hydroelectric dams on the upper Mazaruni River would flood the entire territory of the Akawaio indigenous people.

Kukkoaho placed fourth in men's 400 metres at the 1971 and 1974 European Championships and sixth at the 1972 Summer Olympics, where he set the still- standing Finnish national record of 45.49 seconds. He won bronze at the 1974 European Championships in the 4 × 400 metres relay as part of the Finnish team. Career Kukkoaho won his first medals at the Finnish national championships (Kalevan kisat) in 1970, when he won the 400 metres in 46.5 and placed second in the 200 metres in 21.7. His best 400 m time that year was 46.1, which equaled Voitto Hellstén's national record from the 1956 Olympic semi-finals. In 1971 he was national champion in both events (20.8/46.9) and was selected for the 400 m and the 4 × 400 m relay for the 1971 European Championships in Helsinki. In the 400 m he set a new Finnish record, 45.74, but still finished just out of medals in fourth. The Finnish relay team was disqualified in the heats. Kukkoaho won the national 400 m title again in 1972 (46.9) and was selected for the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich, again for both the individual 400 m and the 4 × 400 m relay. In the individual race he qualified for the final, in which he placed sixth. His time in the final, 45.49, broke his own Finnish record; , it still remains the national record, and only three other Finns have run under 46 seconds. In the relay the Finnish team of Stig Lönnqvist, Ari Salin, Ossi Karttunen and Kukkoaho ran 3:01.12, likewise placing sixth; that time also still remains the national record. In 1974, Kukkoaho won the national 400 m title for a fourth and final time; his winning time that year was 45.8, which still remains the championship record. At that year's European Championships he again placed a close fourth in the individual 400 m, missing out on a medal by 0.06 seconds; in the relay, however, he got his first international medal. The Finnish team of Lönnqvist, Karttunen, Markku Taskinen and Kukkoaho ran 3:03.57 and placed a close third behind Great Britain and West Germany; Finland was briefly disqualified due to Kukkoaho shoving France's anchor Francis Demarthon, but after a successful Finnish protest the disqualification was overturned and the team regained its medals. Kukkoaho won his final national individual title in 1976, winning the 200 m in his personal best time of 20.73; that spring, he ran the unusual distance of 300 metres in 33.2 for another still-standing national record.

However, it sometimes has a pink flushHow to Grow Dorsett Golden Apples even on large surface, which only enhances its attraction and beauty. It is mainly used for fresh eating having very good texture and sweet flavor. It harvests at early season, and like other early season cultivars, it does not keep fresh too long. Tree has average vigour and is a precocious spur bearer. Dorsett Golden does best at USDA hardiness zones 5–9. Researchers at University of Florida had observed a Dorset Golden being evergreen, even- though it cannot set fruits properly if it has no dormancy. Usually it goes dormant in December, so then is the best time to do fruit tree pruning.

As Aquin was primarily a writer, he worked with a variety of cameramen. The NFB credits 11 on the film—, Michel Brault, Georges Dufaux, Claude Fournier, Bernard Gosselin, Jean Roy, Claude Jutra, Bernard Devlin, Arthur Lipsett, Don Owen and Daniel Fournier. Caroline Zéau in her book L'Office national du film et le cinéma canadien (1939-2003): éloge de la frugalité states that as many as 28 filmmakers worked on the project, including the entire French production team, with Jacques Godbout reading narration. The film was originally released in French as a 42-minute film. The English-language version is shorter, with a 27-minute running time. Reaction While the filmmakers sought to make a socially activist film by portraying conditions in the poor neighbourhood, some residents were so dismayed by their depiction in the film that they withdrew their children from school and moved out of the area. In subsequent NFB films such as Fernand Dansereau's Saint-Jérôme, filmmakers sought to involve residents in a participatory filmmaking process, so as to avoid such a negative reaction. Sequel In 2011, director Shannon Walsh assembled 16 filmmakers to once again record the first day of school for children in Saint- Henri, in the NFB/Parabola Films documentary À St-Henri, le 26 août.

The garden is part of the so-called Quaianlagen, a series of lakefronts in Zürich. The area also houses a lido, a public bath with a lake sauna, and the Voliere Zürich including the Vogelpflegestation, a unique sanatorium for birds.  Location  Arboretum is situated in Zürich-Enge, as of today being a district of the city of Zürich, on Zürichsee lake shore being a part of the so-called Quaianlagen initiated by Arnold Bürkli. The park is separated by the General-Guisan-Quai and Mythenquai roads, from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area. Public transport is provided by the Zürich Tram route 5, as well by the VBZ bus lines 161 and 165 at the Rentenanstalt stop.  History  The Arboretum is an important part of the historical lake quays (German: Quaianlagen) which were inaugurated in 1887. The quays are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Zürich, as by the construction of the new lake front, Zürich was transformed from the medieval small town on the Limmat and Sihl rivers to an attractive modern city on the Zürichsee lake shore. Arboretum - General-Guisan-Quai 2011-07-31 18-51-52.jpg Arboretum 2012-05-17 16-04-38 (P7000).JPG Arnold Bürkli Denkmal - Arboretum 2011-07-31 18-48-28.jpg Arboretum Zürich 2012-03-27 13-53-12 (P7000).JPG Arboretum Zürich 2011-03-23 14-37-40.JPG The Arboretum was created according to the then-current style of a public garden. Originally, it was intended as a cultivated and richly equipped, but otherwise conventional parkland. Shortly before the construction work started, a group of botany and geology professors made proposals to enrich the park concept, in due consideration of scientific aspects. A tree collection with exotic plants, a rock collection, and an Alpine panorama accounting the Glarus Alps view from the park should provide to the citizens a piece of education on a Sunday stroll. The affiliated formed Arboretum Kommission comprised also the landscape architects Evariste Mertens and Otto Froebel and the botany Professor Carl Schröter, who managed to communicate science and beauty in the new park. In 1886 the work for the design of the plant started, and Otto Froebel teamed up with his professional colleagues Evariste Mertens. Cleverly, they modeled the fresh lake level terrain wrested from and the park in the style of the late garden laid, and succeeded in the picturesque grouping of trees. The scientific concept is rounded off by a rock collection, as well as the first alpine panorama of Zürich. The trees of the so-called China-group on the lake shore hide three one-man bunkers, which were built in 1942 to 'protect' the lower lake basin; since 1992, the bunkers are under cantonal conservation. The Arboretum is obtained largely in its original composition, but in the 1980s it became an urgent task to continue the original scientific concept in the replanting, however, larger groups of trees had to be replaced and new planted trees had to be integrated in the existing planting concept. The basis for the development of the park maintenance according to the original concept was introduced in 1985.  Collection and structure  Today it presents many trees in mature beauty. The trees developed in over a hundred years enormously; many groups of trees have reached their maximum, others have already been renewed. The challenge of the coming decades is to renew the tree collection the scientific concept of the past, to also future generations to the refined richness of the botanical collection to be true to. The Arboretum is maintained as first historic park system in Zurich since 1985 according to garden conservation aspects.  Segments according to Professor Schröter  Based on the concept of Professor Schröter, the tree collection is divided into three segments: * The largest segment comprises nine sections and groups of trees that originate from different regions of the world. In the early 19th century, the choice of the trees was unconventional, among them species from southern Switzerland, the Alps, the Jura Mountains, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the southern and eastern states of the US, from California, Canada, Japan and China. * The second segment includes four systematic floral districts, and trees of the same plant families, among them Elms, Maples, Ash trees and Beech. * Situated on the small lake shore hill, the third segment consists solely of the plants of the Tertiary flora, i.e. of the formation of the Alps. These trees had been native to Central Europe before the Late Glacial Maximum including plants spread from Scandinavia to the southern area of Europe.

The tree was imported from the USA respectively the east coast between the states of New York and Georgia, and wears from late spring to early summer blue-gray flowers, changed to pink in early autumn fruits and later deep red cucumbers. Its down to earth reaching, strong branches predestine it almost to become a popular climbing tree for children. In addition, the China group also is represented by Prunus serotina and Toona sinensis, a cedar, which is native to northern and western China. At the Enge lido is situated an impressive Beech group whose branches are cascading to the ground. Inside the group of trees are also powerful green-leaved trees, but also the purple Fagus sylvatica f. purpurea, and the outer ends form narrow- leaved Beeches. In the summer when the trees are in full leaf, they form a tree cathedral, in those shadows reigns a soothing coolness and soft twilight. Since 2006 an open gap in the middle of the group, as the central Beech unfortunately had to be cut. The death of the otherwise durable Beech is also a result of poor soil conditions, which occur on the artificial lake shore bed. Just steps away, there is a beautiful example of a tree grafting; aFraxinus americana graftage based on a slower growing surface, thus the strain at the intersection is almost seamlessly thicker. The lakeward side of the easterly hill section is meant by the garden architects as an open-minded moraine, and an alpinum, a collection of mountain plants, but some years later was abandoned as one of the 'garden fashions' of the 19th century. The high maintenance perennial planting was replaced with flowers shrubs as being much more easier to care by the park maintenance workers. Since 1988 the alpine garden blooms again, but the mountain plants are found only on the sunniest places to the southwest, and rather robust blooms perennials, including Sedums and Hylotelephium from the nearby Sukkulentensammlung. The original rock formation on the lake shore was intended, to lead the eye of the observer in the distance to the Alps. The information board that is illustrating the Alpine panorama is supposed to have been the first of its kind in Zürich, to round off the concept of education and edification of the Zürich citizenship. Around the increased park benches at the hill, there is arranged tree group that consists almost entirely of dark Pinophytas. The garden architectes intended to extend the perspective by planting initially bright tree species with small leaves, seamlessly to dark-leaved species, and finally to exit the arboretum towards the Enge harbour in a perspective sense to evergreen species. After the devastation of the Lothar storm in December 1999, this group of trees had to be overall replaced, based on the first tree inventory of 1898. The total renewal of the group had the advantage that all trees have the identical starting conditions and sufficient light to flourish in a few decades to ensure original character of the arboretum.  Aviary and bird's sanatory  Voliere Zürich towards Mythenquai The Arboreturm also houses a small aviary and the so-called Vogelpflegestation, meaning a unique veterinary hospital for wild birds. It claims to be the most important emergency department in Switzerland for injured and sick wild birds, and also for young birds that were fallen from their nests. Established in 1902, it is focused on the bird rescue and the publicity for the population, and therefore houses a unique competence center for native and exotic birds emerged. The foundation is financed by contributions and donations from its about 700 members, and by donations from individuals and prestigious foundations. The bird care station has a reputation, which goes far beyond the Swiss borders. For tourists, in particular for ornithologists, it is a very attractive point of attraction due to its unique portfolio of exotic birds. But also the townspeople themselves, use the wheelchair visitors hall of the aviary to expand their knowledge of the world of birds, of which approximately 111 exotics in 33 species are represented. Each year there are around 45,000 visitors, including many tourists, who get free information about some of the rarest bird species of Switzerland in eight naturally designed inn walks and three landscape-like outdoor enclosures.  Seebad Enge  Enge lido, Adlisberg in the background. The lido of the Arboretum is also a very popular public bath, and also houses the swimming Seebad Enge, which is also a unique Zürichsee lake shore sauna during winter season. The swimming lido consists of a building construction that is anchored in the lake. Conceived by Robert Landolt, the two-piece bathing complex was built in 1959/60, since 1999 it is private-owned and provides an open lake side sauna and gastronomy which were installed in 2003/04.  Arnold Bürkli Memorial  Arnold Bürkli memorial At the foot of the lake shore hill that elevates around , the Arnold Bürkli memorial honors the tireless creating engineer being the driving force behind the new quays. The simple monument was inaugurated in 1899, five years after his death, at Bürkli's favorite place in the Arboretum, or by the words of the sculptor Richard Kissling, in the midst of his creation.

Depicting the docks of New York City, this painting was sold to the National Gallery in London in 2014 for $25.5 million. Description Men of the Docks is a oil painting on canvas. It depicts a group of men, wearing overcoats smeared in grime, standing at a dock in Brooklyn together with some draft horses. These men appear to be day laborers, at the docks to find work. They look to the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner looms over them to their right. Behind them are a tugboat and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower Manhattan skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray. A writer for The Craftsman considered Men of the Docks to be \\"free of affectation of soul or technique\\", presenting a situation of solidity the way a normal man would see it, thus holding onto the scene through reality. However, the art critics Robert W. Snyder and Rebecca Zurier consider the painting to leave viewers in suspense as to the exact nature of the message received by this group of men, whether it is news that no work is available or notice that the men can begin their labor. This tension, they write, paired with the juxtaposition of the skyline and harbor (almost hidden from land), emphasizes the precariousness of the laborers' situation. Completion George Bellows, 1900 The artist, George Bellows, arrived in New York City in 1904. He completed Men of the Docks in 1912. At the time the Ashcan School, a group of painters who focused on the daily life in New York, was prominent. Bellows, and Men of the Docks, has been considered part of this movement. In the early 20th century, day laborers in the New York docks worked depending on the availability of ships to unload, and thus when not working they often stood nearby, waiting for news that there was work. This subject of men at the New York docks was a common one for Bellows, as well as fellow Ashcan painters such as Everett Shinn. Men of the Docks is the largest example of Bellows' treatment of the subject. Provenance Men of the Docks was exhibited at the Vanderbilt Gallery of the National Academy of Design in 1912, as well as Cornell University. Bellows again exhibited the work at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition of 1915, winning a gold medal. The painting was purchased for the Maier Museum of Art at Randolph Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1920; at the time, the college was one of the foremost for women intent on studying art. At the recommendation of Professor Louise Jordan Smith, students and locals raised $2,500 to purchase the work. Beginning with this painting, the Maier collection eventually grew to include 3,500 works. After the 1980s, Randolph College faced decreasing enrollment and financial difficulties. As such, in 2007 it decided to sell four of its works – including Men of the Docks. All of these works were taken from the Maier Museum in late 2007. Bellows' painting was scheduled to be auctioned at Christie's in New York, and expected to sell for $25–35 million. This would have been a record for an American painting sold at auction. However, this prospective sale faced controversy at the college. Students made \\"Missing\\" posters overlaid showing photocopies of Men of the Docks and the three other paintings which were to be sold. A lawsuit against the sale continued over the next several years, with detractors including the Association of Academic Museums and Galleries, the College Art Association, and the Association of Art Museum Directors. As the art market deflated, a Virginia judge blocked the sale in November 2007, but in March 2008 opponents of the sale had to drop their suit as they were unable to post the $1 million bond required of them. In 2012 the painting was lent to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to be included in a comprehensive exhibition of Bellow's career. This exhibition later continued on to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Ultimately, Men of the Docks was bought by the National Gallery in London in February 2014 for a total of $25.5 million (£15.6 million). The money was acquired from a fund established by Sir John Paul Getty. Director Nicholas Penny, said that the painting was a new direction for the gallery, as a non-European painting in a European style. The museum also touted a “new, transatlantic academic partnership, the first of its kind between an American college and a UK gallery” established by the sale, in which curators could lecture at Randolph and students of the college could do their internships at the National Gallery. In response to the sale, the College Art Association stated that Randolph had \\"compromised the educational and cultural mission of the museum\\" by selling art to increase its coffers, rather than to purchase further art. In protest, both the Indianapolis Museum of Art and Tacoma Art Museum cancelled plans to borrow a Georgia O'Keeffe work. College president Bradley W. Bateman defended the sale by saying that the college was \\"a college, not a museum\\", and thus not bound to follow guidelines established for museums. He further argued that Randolph's priority was to ensure quality education for its students, and that the $25.5 million for the painting was a \\"considerable\\" addition to the college's endowment of $136 million. At the time of the sale, Randolph had already sold another of its works, Rufino Tamayo's Troubador. Men of the Docks was the first major American painting acquired by the gallery, and the second painting by Bellows to be publicly owned in Europe. After its acquisition, Men of the Docks was hung in Room 43 of the National Gallery, between works by such European artists as Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro. The painting, with the accession number of NG6649, hangs in Room 45 . Reception Critic Charles Henry Meltzer, reviewing after the National Academy exhibition, described Men of the Docks as \\"irritating ... yet full of talent\\" owing to its \\"deliberate carelessness\\" in the drawing of the crowd, which he found to have character. The writer for The Craftsman found the painting to be \\"an important painting of the year\\", \\"a freshly painted canvas ... presented with the thrill and wonder inherent in the edges of great seaport towns\\". Marc Porter of Christie's described Men of the Docks as \\"the definitive essay on the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century. It’s big, brawny, tough.\\" Alan Franham of Forbes called it \\"a class by itself\\", noting that, as opposed to the work's value of millions of dollars, prints by the artist could be bought for $50,000. The curator Christopher Riopelle considers the painting to \\"evoke something of the raw and unbeautiful energy of the urban experience in what was at the time one of the world's fastest-growing cities\\" through its \\"wilful awkwardness and brutality\\".

It was designed by Bertrand Goldberg, to whose Marina City it bears clear affinities, and was completed in 1986 in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago.  Development and history  River City is situated alongside the Chicago River and consists of two 7- to 14-story, serpentine residential towers constructed of reinforced, poured-in-place concrete \\"shells\\" with 449 residential units, varying in size from studios to 4-bedroom penthouses. The towers sit on a 4-story post-and-beam \\"plinth\\" that contains approximately 225,000 square feet of commercial and office space, including a 50,000 square foot health club with full-size pool, an underground, indoor parking lot, and a 70-slip marina with a bubbler system that prevents freezing and permits year-round use. The roof of the base structure is a transfer floor that holds a 1-acre, landscaped private park for the residents, \\"Skyline Park\\", as well as a 10-story, enclosed, skylighted atrium between the two residential towers, \\"River Road\\".River City was originally conceived on a much larger scale. It was to consist of a series of 72-story mixed-use skyscrapers, clustered in groups of three, and joined every 18 stories by triangular platforms containing resident services. The architect called these clusters \\"triads\\". The complex was intended to be capable of housing as many as 30,000 families, the grand culmination of Goldberg's utopian vision of a \\"city within a city\\". He had an expansive conception of the responsibilities of a residential developer and planned to provide an extensive range of services to residents from medical clinics to educational and training facilities for \\"lifelong learning\\". Goldberg was unable to secure approval for this ambitious project from Chicago's Plan Commission, however. The project went through various re- designs over the next decade, ultimately resulting in the scaled-down current structure. Goldberg and the developers made plans to expand River City to the north and south, but were unable to acquire financing for additions to the building. The residential portion was converted to condominiums in 2001-2006 by American Invsco. In December 2018, the building was acquired by investors who are converting the condominiums back into rental apartments. In 2019, the new owners started extensive renovations to prepare the building for rentals. Architectural preservationists complained when the raw concrete interior of the \\"River Road\\" atrium was painted white. The controversy prompted Bertrand Goldberg's son, Geoffrey, himself an architect, to publish an essay in which he called the change a \\"diminution\\" of the original architect's intention for the building's design. In the 2014 film Divergent, the set for \\"Abnegation\\" was built on the vacant land immediately north of River City In the film, River City appears to loom over the modest housing of Abnegation. In the 2006 film Stranger than Fiction, Will Farrell's character moves into a co-worker's apartment in River City. The apartment used for filming is 1702/1704, a 3-bedroom triplex where architect Bertrand Goldberg briefly lived combined with a studio apartment.

He is one of the buddhist religious authorities in Europe signator of the interreligious Italian \\"Manifesto della pace\\" (Peace Manifesto). Biography After a short career in the world of photography and cinema, Carlo Serra arrives in Japan in 1983, and is ordained monk (出家 shukke), with the Dharma name (戒名, kaimyō) Tetsugen, at the Tosho-ji (東照寺) monkery of Tokyo. He became disciple of the abbot Ban Tetsugyu Soin Roshi (伴鐵牛, 1910–1996). During his training of monk, he attended the Institute of eastern medicine founded by Shizuto Masunaga (増永静人 1925–1981), from which, in 1988, he got a certificate of teacher of eastern medicine and Zen Shiatsu. The composite background of zen monk and shiatsu teacher opened to Tetsugen his intention to use the shiatsu discipline as zen practice, that will become one of particularity of his work in Italy. After five years training in Toshoji, Tetsugen was sent as a buddhist missionary in Italy, and in 1988 grounded the first monastery in Milan, Enso-ji il Cerchio. In 1992 had birth also the Shiatsu Zen school (\\"Scuola Zen di Shiatsu\\"). In 1995 follows the beginning, even in Enso-ji, of the offering of shiatsu massage, which permitted to monks and shiatsu teachers to use and improve the abilities apprehended in the training, making a job of that.

The confirm of this title accompanied the acknowledgement of Tetsugen as independent master by the international association \\"Sōtōshū shumucho\\" (曹洞宗宗務庁), to which belong many of the Soto temples and monasteries in Japan and in the World. Between 2000 and 2003, Tetsugen covered the seat of member of the direction of UBI (Italian Buddhist Union). The first years of 21st Century saw a gradual evolution of the approach of Tetsugen's doctrine, that began to put the basis for a new development of zen teaching and practising that could transfer the meanings of buddhist and zen tradition following the demands and the languages of the western society. The Italian zen master tested also an approach to management of the zen discipline of koan solving creating in 2003 the society \\"ZenEssere\\" (ZenBeing), deeping a theoretical path that took him to publish, for the publishing house Guerini Management by Zen Koan, in which he develops an application of Zen teaching to management. The work of Tetsugen Serra spreads itself also to experimentations that make from Zen teaching and cognitive psychology a lay path of self-improvement with the offering of counseling sessions, helping to solve daily problems about the attitude to life. In 2012 Tetsugen finishes to perfect the path of consciousness development named MindfulZen, that through sessions of meetings, seminars and appropriate essays achieve the Italian master's intention to build a path to mindfulness from zen teachings in a lay a contemporary way.

It is approximately long and flows through Davidson Township in Sullivan County and Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream has three named tributaries: Gallows Run, Hog Run, and Long Run. Elk Run is considered to be an Exceptional Value stream and a Migratory Fishery. The forests surrounding it are deemed by the Sullivan County Natural Areas Inventory to be a \\"locally significant\\" area. The stream is named for an elk that was killed in it in the 1840s. Elk Run is considered to be impaired by atmospheric deposition for a portion of its length. Glacial activity occurred near the stream during the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Wisconsinan Ice-Contract Stratified Drift, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till, Wisconsinan Till, and alluvium can be found near the stream. A bridge was constructed over it in 2000. Course The mouth of Elk Run Elk Run begins on the northern edge of North Mountain in northern Davidson Township, Sullivan County. It flows southeast for a short distance before entering a deep valley and receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. The stream then turns south-southwest and its valley deepens. After some distance, it receives its first named tributary, Gallows Run, from the right. The stream then turns south-southeast. Over the next few miles, it receives the tributaries Hog Run and Long Run from the left. It then reaches the village of Elk Grove and exits Sullivan County. Upon exiting Sullivan County, Elk Run enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. It continues flowing south-southeast through the village of Elk Grove. After a short distance, the stream reaches its confluence with West Branch Fishing Creek. Elk Run joins West Branch Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Elk Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between . Elk Run has a high gradient and is a clearwater creek. The valley of Elk Run is mostly in the vicinity of Wisconsinan Ice-Contract Stratified Drift, a glacial till known as Wisconsinan Bouldery Till, and alluvium. However, Wisconsinan Till is found near the stream's headwaters. Bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale lines the slopes of the stream's valley. The Ice-Contract Stratified Drift is found in small clumps in the stream's valley, as well as the valley of West Branch Fishing Creek. During the late Wisconsin glaciation, the location of the headwaters of Elk Run were at the glacial terminus on the northern part of North Mountain. During this glaciation, a tongue of ice flowed down the stream's valley to merge with another tongue of ice in the village of Elk Grove. Watershed The watershed of Elk Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Elk Grove. The part of the stream that is in Columbia County is in northern Sugarloaf Township. Elk Run is in the headwaters of the watershed of Fishing Creek. It is within Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13. A wetland is located near the headwaters of Elk Run. History and etymology Elk Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1174123. A prestressed box beam bridge carrying State Route 4049 over Elk Run in Elk Grove was constructed in 2000. This bridge is long. The stream was surveyed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in 1994. In the 1840s, hunters Benjamin McHenry and Silas Jackson killed an elk in the vicinity of Elk Run. The elk died in the stream. Elk were extremely rare in Columbia County and the elk that was killed in the stream was one of the few in northeastern Pennsylvania. The stream is named after the elk, making it one of approximately a thousand natural features in the United States to be named after elk. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Elk Run between its headwaters and its mouth. The stream is designated as an Exceptional Value stream throughout its entire drainage basin. The stream's basin is also designated as a Migratory Fishery. As of the 1990s, Elk Run's biomass class for wild brook trout is B. The biomass of trout in the stream is more than 20 kilograms per hectare. A lynx nearly long was observed in the vicinity of Elk Run in around 1900. A forest community along Elk Run is considered by the Sullivan County Natural Areas Inventory to be \\"locally significant\\". It serves as a riparian buffer for the stream. This forest contains trees of varying ages and some have trunks up to more than thick. The slopes in the forest mainly contain sugar maples. However, there are smaller numbers of basswood, beech, hemlock, white ash, and yellow birch. The shrub layer of the forest is described as \\"well-developed\\" in the Sullivan County Natural Areas Inventory. It contains elderberry, striped maple, and witch hazel.

A wetland plant, Manchurian wild rice is now very rare in the wild, and its use as a grain has completely disappeared in China, though it continues to be cultivated for its stems. A measure of its former popularity is that the surname Jiǎng (Trad. , Simp. ), one of the most common in China, derives from this crop. Cultivation Vegetables: Zizania latifolia stems peeled and unpeeled. Zizania latifolia is grown as an agricultural crop across Asia. The success of the crop depends on the smut fungus Ustilago esculenta. The grass is not grown for its grain, as are other wild rice species, but for the stems, which swell into juicy galls when infected with the smut. When the fungus invades the host plant it causes it to hypertrophy; its cells increasing in size and number. Infection with U. esculenta prevents the plant from flowering and setting seed so the crop is propagated asexually, by rhizome. New sprouts are infected by spores in the environment, which is generally a paddy. The galled stems are harvested as a vegetable known as Simp: 胶笋; Trad: 膠筍 (Pinyin:jiāo sǔn) and also, in the past, transliterated as gau-soon and kal-peh-soonChung, K. R. and D. D. Tzeng. (2004).

In 1820, Major Thomas Penrice of Great Yarmouth acquired the manor: in June 1831 he was ordered by the Marquess of Bute, Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan, to tackle civil unrest associated with the Reform Bill. To his huge embarrassment, Penrice and his Yeomanry troops were disarmed by a large mob of rioters and, following an official inquiry, the local Yeomanry unit was re-organised by the Government. The house passed to Penrice's nephew and, through the nephew's daughter, to the Lyons family. Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Lyons died there in 1908. In the 1930s it was bought by Arthur Thomas, a Swansea businessman, and in 1949 it was bought by the Oxfordshire Education Committee. It is now an outdoor learning centre.

Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine was a pulp magazine which was launched in December 1936. It was published by Harold Hersey, and was an attempt to cash in on the growing comics boom, and the popularity of the Flash Gordon comic strip in particular. The magazine contained a novel about Flash Gordon and three unrelated stories; there were also eight full-page color illustrations. The quality of both the artwork and the fiction was low, and the magazine only saw a single issue. It is now extremely rare. Publication history and contents Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback.Edwards & Nicholls (1992), pp. 1066–1068. After 1931, when Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories was launched, no new science fiction magazines appeared for several years. In 1934 a science fiction comic strip following the adventures of superhero Flash Gordon appeared in newspapers and quickly became popular. In 1936 the strip spawned a movie serial in thirteen parts, also titled Flash Gordon. Late that year Harold Hersey, an experienced pulp magazine editor and publisher, decided to launch three new magazines based on comics.Bleiler (1998), pp. 575–577. The first two were titled Dan Dunn Detective Magazine and Tailspin Tommy Air Adventure Magazine; these were launched in September and October 1936 respectively. The third was Flash Gordon Strange Adventures Magazine, which saw a single issue, dated December 1936; it was copyrighted by both Hersey and King Features, the syndicate that owned the copyright to Flash Gordon. Dan Dunn and Tailspin Tommy produced one more issue each before Hersey closed down the venture. It is not known why only one issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine appeared; poor sales figures from the other magazines may have been responsible,Ashley (1985), pp. 273–274. or Hersey may simply have run out of money, or possibly King Features, the owner of the copyright to Flash Gordon, only granted rights to Hersey for one issue, and withdrew from the venture after the first issue appeared.Ashley (2000), p. 98. Sf historian Everett Bleiler notes that Hersey did not mention the venture in his autobiographical Pulpwood Editor, published a year later, and adds that \\"given Hersey's usual attempts to glorify himself and to gild his failures, this silence suggests a fiasco larger than usual\\". The magazine contained a lead novel and three short stories. The novel, The Master of Mars, by James Edison Northford (or Northfield; the name is spelled one way on the contents page and the other way at the head of the story), has been described by Bleiler as \\"moronic\\". Bleiler also comments that of three short stories, one is dated and another third-rate. Two of the stories were by R.R. Winterbotham; one, \\"The Saga of the Smokepot\\", was published under his own name; the other, \\"The Last War\\", was published under the pseudonym \\"R.R. Botham\\". The other story, \\"The Man Without a Brain\\", is a collaboration between R.C. Vance (or R.C. Vane; as with Northford, the magazine is inconsistent in spelling the name) and F.K. Young. Hersey's idea was to have a pulp magazine about comic strip characters; he hoped that there would be sufficient overlap between pulp readers and comics fans to make the magazine successful. The presentation was like that of a typical pulp, but with eight full page color illustrations, all by Fred Meagher, who had previously illustrated Westerns. Bleiler describes the artwork as crude and \\"far inferior to the sometimes elegant work\\" of Alex Raymond, the creator of Flash Gordon. The attempt to market pulp fiction to comics fans turned out to be the wrong approach: the comics field was on the verge of dramatic successes, but the crossover appeal for pulp magazines was not there. The magazine was not widely known at the time it was issued, and has since become extremely rare.  Bibliographic details  The publisher of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine was C.J.H. Publishing Co., based in New York. The sole issue was numbered volume 1, number 1; it was in large pulp format, with 96 pages and was priced at 10 cents. Harold Hersey was the president of C.J.H. and the editor of the magazine. A facsimile of the magazine was released as a book in 2005.

Its range extends from the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the White Sea to eastern Greenland, and the eastern coast of North America as far south as Massachusetts. Its depth range reaches as deep as . It is also known from the northern Pacific Ocean, from British Columbia to South Korea. Description Onchidoris proxima is oval in shape and grows to a length of about . The head has a flattened piece of tissue above the mouth. The mantle is covered with club-shaped tubercles with pointed ends which are stiffened with calcareous spicules (spine-like structures). The body is a yellowish- orange colour, but is often quite a pale shade, especially in the northernmost part of the animal's range.

It also houses the so-called Vogelpflegestation, a unique sanatory for birds.  Location  upright upright upright The aviary is situated at the Arboretum in Enge (Zürich) on Zürichsee lake shore, being a part of the so-called Quaianlagen. It is separated by the General-Guisan-Quai and Mythenquai roads respectively the Arboretum from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area. Public transport is provided by the Zürich Tram route 5, as well as by the VBZ bus lines 161 and 165 at the Rentenanstalt stop.  History  Public area of the bird care center The so-called Vogelpflegestation, meaning a veterinary hospital respectively a sanatorium for birds, claims to be the most important emergency department in Switzerland for injured and sick wild birds, and also young birds that were fallen from their nest. Established in 1902, it is focused on bird rescue and information centre for the population, as well as a competence center for native and exotic birds that are emerged. The aviary has experienced financial issues since the city of Zürich ceased their support for the facility in 2000. The foundation is financed by contributions from members of its donor organization, Voliere-Gesellschaft Zürich. Staffing issues, as well as a higher-than-usual number of birds at the facility, are a factor in the financial situation.  Aims  The aviary and the bird care station have a reputation which goes far beyond the Swiss borders. For tourists, in particular for ornithologists, it is a very attractive destination due to its unique portfolio of exotic birds. But also the citizens of Zürich use the wheelchair visitor hall of the aviary to expand their knowledge of the world of birds, of which approximately 111 exotics in 33 species are represented. Each year around 45,000 visitors ask for free information of some of the rarest bird species of Switzerland, housed at eight naturally designed inn walks and three landscape-like outdoor enclosures. The three main tasks of the institution include the continuous improvement of the bird care station, the free educational work especially to the youth about the nature and animal welfare, but in particular the protection of birds, and obtaining the auspicious bird board.  Services  One of the winter guests The aviary also provides unique services to the population. It houses the bird nursing station HelpBird, claiming to be the busiest in Switzerland. It also offers free help, including ornithology education for schools, hands on educational activities, an information service via phone and mail, and special exhibitions. In addition as a paid service there is a bird aviary boarding facility used by around 300 birds from over 200 owners.  Bird care center  bird 'emergency boxes' The bird care center (German: Vogelpflegestation) is the main reception center in Switzerland for sick, injured or wild birds fallen out of their nests. As the aviary itself, it is staffed 365 days a year and takes care, every day from 10:00 (10 am) to 12:00 (12 am) and from 14:00 (2 pm) to 16:00 (4 pm), feathered emergency patients. Outside the opening times the wild birds may delivered in two special \\"bird boxes\\" at the entrance. In the largest sanatory for wild birds in Switzerland, only two people are employed for feeding and cleaning of the cages and enclosures, procurement of fodder, for advice and support of inquiries, looking for places for breeding birds and so one. We are literally overrun, and so the two employees had daily at 06:30 to feed the birds and specially catered young birds also at sunset. The long worktime in spring is directly related to the dramatic increase in sick and injured wild birds, of which 68% in 2010 were young birds that are fallen from the nest. People have been aware ... when they discover young birds, they call the police or animal rescue service which bring the birds to us. Absolute bustle prevails in the months of May to August, when the list of the animal patients is led by Mallards (300), followed by House Sparrows (107) Blackbirds (93) feral Pigeons (82), Crows (65), Swifts (55), Blue Tits (30), and many other, partly very rare species. Of the total of 1,150 wild birds, 45% have been saved. 1,579 wild birds of 70 species have been cared in 2012, about 20% more than in the year before, of which 55.4% were released back into the wild. In the same period 64 breeding birds of different species have been introduced. Thus, the number of the submitted breeding birds rose again to 64.1%, for all birds there were found within a year good places for further care, as well for 154 'exotics'. The purveyors of exotic, wild and farmed birds include people from the city of Zürich and its metropolitan area, as well as from all over Switzerland, including the Zürich fire department and government services, the police services, the animal hospital of Zürich and the veterinary services of the Canton of Zürich.

It was built in the 1840s or 1850s, rising through two inclined planes to reach the main Cwmorthin Quarry mill and its internal incline which rose from floor 1 to floor 8. In 1874, it was extended, rising up through a third incline to the Cwmorthin Lake level and continuing along the valley floor to reach the Conglog Quarry. The tracks to Conglog were abandoned in the 1920s and the rest of the tramway ceased to be used from the onset of the Second World War. History Quarrying of slate in the Cwmorthin Valley, to the west of Blaenau Ffestiniog, began around 1810 but was not particularly successful, in part due to the difficulties of transporting the finished product away from the quarry. After a lull of some ten years, work began again in 1840, and in 1861 the Cwmorthin Slate Company was incorporated. The company bought the freehold to the land on which quarrying took place. At some point, a tramway was built to connect the mill to the Ffestiniog Railway near to the site of station. Boyd suggests that a survey for the line was prepared in the mid-1840s, and that the cost was estimated to be £1,407 and 19 shillings. The line was completed by 1850, when it was mentioned in Cliffe's The Book of North Wales. However, Richards and Isherwood maintain that the tramway was constructed under the auspices of the 1861 Company, soon after it was established. The connection to the Ffestiniog Railway was never very satisfactory. A point left the main line, and immediately split into three tracks. Two were used for wagon storage, while the third passed through a gate, beyond which the twin tracks of the first incline began. Empty wagons were delivered to the sidings by the shunting engine from Blaenau Ffestiniog, but to get them up to the quarry, they were shunted by hand back onto the main line, and then onto one of the incline tracks. Loaded wagons followed the reverse procedure, so that they were marshalled in the sidings for collection by the Ffestiniog. Because this process involved moving wagons onto the main line, it could only be done when the single line staff for the track section above Tan y Grisiau was withdrawn from the token machine by the Tan y Grisiau stationmaster. He then supervised the operation of a small ground frame which controlled the points. A Board of Trade inspector visiting the site in 1864 objected to the arrangement, because there were no trap points to protect the main line, and ruled that distant signals must be fitted by the Ffestiniog Railway, that there should be a telegraph installed between the station and the drumhouse at the top of the incline, and that no trains should use the main line while the incline was in operation. The first incline headed towards the north-east, was some long and raised the level of the track by . It was generally known as the Village incline, and a stone bridge carried the minor road to the hamlet of Dolrhedyn over the lower section. There was a section of stone and earth embankment, and then a shallow rock cutting before the drumhouse was reached. This consisted of a drum which was long and in diameter, but little else, as there was no shelter for the brakesman who controlled its operation. The length of the wire rope differs wildly in different sources, ranging from to . The twin tracks of the incline became a single track as it passed under the drum and then split again to form two tracks where the wagons were marshalled. This section was in a cutting, some deep, which curved around towards the north-west. The track continued through cuttings and on embankments until the marshalling loop at the foot of the Tai Muriau incline was reached. The second incline raised the level of the track by another to reach the lower mill, which was later known as London Hall. At this point the tramway is on the contour. To the left of the incline, rubbish tramways from the mill served the mill tip. There was a network of tracks around the mill, and a second mill called the Cross Mill, where a 90 degree bend swung the route round to reach the foot of the main quarry incline, which rose in a north-easterly direction. This consisted of two sections, the first rising from floor 1 to floor 6, with a drumhouse as its head, and the second, continuing the same line, rising to floor 8, where there was a second drumhouse. The plan in Boyd shows a third incline on the tramway before the main quarry incline, but this is because the quarry incline is shown too far to the north-west.Ordnance Survey, 1:2,500 map, 1888 Extension Quarrying at Conglog, further up the Cwmorthin Valley, began in 1854, and in 1873 the Conglog Slate and Slab Co Ltd was registered, with a capital of £40,000. An agreement was reached in 1868, which would allow Conglog to lay rails down the valley, to connect to the existing Cwmorthin Tramway. All goods using the tramway would be subject to a toll of 6 pence (2.5p) per ton, with an additional amount payable to the Cwmorthin drivers, who operated the inclines. This was not pursued until 1874, when half of the partnership that ran Conglog was taken over by Charles John Sims. The Cwmorthin manager at the time was Joseph F Sims, and although it is not known if they were related, the success of the agreement may indicate that they were, since Rhosydd Quarry had been trying to reach an agreement for a tramway down the valley for years without success. The tramway was covered by a 21-year lease, and a requirement was that it should be no more than above the level of Llyn Cwmorthin by the time it reached Cwmorthin Terrace. This was to allow Cwmorthin Quarry to build a tramway from their Lake Mill across the end of Llyn Cwmorthin, to join with the Conglog tramway. From the main Cwmorthin Quarry incline, the track was continued a little further up the valley floor to a loop and then a third incline, generally called the Lake incline, but labelled the Lower incline in Hancock. Just beyond the drumhouse, the tracks split, with the right hand branch crossing beside the lake to Cwmorthin's Lake Mill. The left hand branch was built with surplus materials from the Ffestiniog Railway, and reached the Conglog mill by a reversing siding. Beyond the mill, another incline was used to bring rock down from the workings. Under the terms of the lease, Conglog were responsible for operating the Lake incline, but when the lease ran out, Cwmorthin would become the owners of the section below the junction with their Lake Mill branch. They would make a payment for the rails and the incline drum. There is no further evidence for the takeover, but presumably it took place, since the incline was listed in a sale document dating from 1900 for Cwmorthin, when the Conglog Quarry was still operating. The length of the tramway from Conglog to the Ffestiniog Railway was . Following the 1900 sale of Cwmorthin, it was taken over by Oakeley Quarry, working the same slate veins but from the other side of the Allt-fawr ridge. They began working the quarry through the mountain, and so there were no Cwmorthin men available to operate the inclines. In order to reduce the number of trips across the mountain to operate the tramway, they tried to insist that Conglog must run trains of 10 wagons or more, but this was not easy to achieve, and eventually a compromise was reached, whereby Cadwaladr Roberts, one of the consortium of men working the Conglog Quarry, could operate the inclines himself, at his own risk. There is no evidence of working at Conglog after the early 1920s, and so presumably the extension tramway was unused after that. The Oakeley Quarry records show that the tramway was refurbished in 1936/37, but at the onset of the Second World War in 1939, Cwmorthin was mothballed, and traffic on the lower section ceased.

In 1979–80 led Gabetti Cantù despite to two disadvantages in the final of the Championship where they lost from Sinudyne Bologna, while in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup lost the title -after three years of continuous wins- after a great final in Milan towards the superpower of the European Basketball in the former decade, Emerson Varèse. In 1981 he lived the best moments of his coaching career after having led Squibb Cantù at the top of Serie A for the third and last time in its history to date, while returned to the Cup Winners' Cup final (fifth consecutive time) where his team defeated FC Barcelona. The next and his final season at Cantù (1981–82), he became the third Italian coach who won the FIBA European Champions Cup after Cesare Rubini and Sandro Gamba. Ηaving won everything with the great team of Pallacanestro Cantù, he was found for the next three years at Rome as head coach of Virtus with a view to driving the upper echelons of the Italian League and Europe. The good results came just after the first year and Virtus won the league title for the first and only time in its history. Bianchini, built very quickly a team that seemed to be able to assert with claim the trophy of European Champions. Indeed, the next year (1983–84) Banco di Roma Virtus reached easily in semifinals group stage (top 6) and managed to place, in the second position of the group, which gave the right to fight in the great final against FC Barcelona which was considered the absolute favorite. The European Champions second title was a fact for the \\"prophet\\". In season 1984–85 all things looked that they could replicate these successes of the past two years. Virtus came out first in the regular season and fell victim surprising since been eliminated in the first round of Playoffs from Scavolini Pesaro. In Europe, the team was again in the semi-final group stage, but did not achieve anything more than the fifth and penultimate position above the other Italian team of Granarolo Bologna. Having completed a stunning six years in grand lobby of the Italian and European basketball, Valerio Bianchini accepted the proposal of the Italian basketball federation (FIP) and led the national team for the next two years. In the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain, Italy ranked sixth while in the Eurobasket of Athens in June 1987 where it undefeated in quarterfinals where excluded from Greece of Nikos Galis and Panagiotis Giannakis. In 1987 he joined Scavolini Pesaro and create a team that was highly competitive both in Serie A and in European competitions that took place in the coming years. The championship of 1988 came fatally added to his rich trophy. Despite his good job in Pesaro, returned for two years in Rome and in Virtus without being able to repeat the feat of his first pass. After the brackets of Siena returned to Scavolini for the three years 1993–1996. The second place in the league brought him after almost ten years in the European Championship. There after tough competition Scavolini took fourth place after teams such as Panathinaikos, Real Madrid and CSKA Moscow and found claiming to eight-fold, the entry of the Final Four of Zaragoza towards French Limoges of Božidar Maljković and Michael Young. He spent the last of the good days at the high level, in Teamsystem Bologna where for one year he was fortunate to coach great players of European and world basketball as Carlton Myers, Dominique Wilkins and David Rivers.

He founded the Digital Computer Newsletter published by the Navy from 1949 through 1968. Smith also participated in the development of the COBOL programming language. Smith was born June 26, 1907, in Marshall, Illinois. He graduated from Indiana Central College (now University of Indianapolis), and completed an M.A. in physics at the University of Illinois. He taught high school and junior college until the outbreak of World War II. Smith was on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1946, completing his tour as a lieutenant commander. In June, 1946, he joined the computer section of the Mathematics Branch of the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Postwar computing  While at ONR and later at the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships, Smith oversaw research contracts including Whirlwind and the Harvard calculators. Starting in 1951, Smith collaborated with Mina Rees and Grace Murray Hopper to organize a series of seminars on computing development. In 1946, Smith represented the ONR at the Moore School Lectures organized by the ENIAC team. The following year, Smith compiled summaries of active computer projects and published a survey of their activities. This led to the Navy's Digital Computer Newsletter.  COBOL  In April, 1959, a group of computer manufacturers and users met at the University of Pennsylvania to plan the development of a computer language for business applications. At the time, business-oriented languages were built to work with specific computer systems. This new effort would seek to build a language whose programs could be easily adapted to run on other computers. Gene Smith represented the Navy's Bureau of Ships at that meeting. The development was divided among three task forces: * Short Range – chaired by Grace Hopper * Intermediate Range – chaired by Gene Smith * Long Range – chaired by Saul Gorn The COBOL language evolved from proposals developed by the Short Range Task Force. Smith remained active in the COBOL community through the Conference on Data System Languages (CODASYL) until his retirement.

Her work encompasses non-objective, abstract, cityscape, seascape, landscape, and floral, but she is most noted for the specific clarity and compositional aspects of her non-objective abstracts which she terms haute conduite, a term which refers not only to the resulting watercolor paintings but also to the entire creative process used in their execution. Mary states that visitors to her studio often mistake her watercolors for acrylics. In 1994 Mary purposely set aside looking at the work of others in order to develop the haute conduite style. At that time she had been working as a full-time professional watercolorist for 17 years and wanted to expand the medium by using the oil techniques she had studied as a Fine Art undergraduate student at Boston University, techniques such as scumbling, dragging, and rubbing. She set aside looking at the work of others in order to avoid diluting her process. Endico watercolors are found in public and private collections throughout the U.S. and in 21 other countries.

The Group is the highest de facto body for China's policy towards Hong Kong and Macau. The General Office for the group is also known as the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.  History  The Group was established as the Central Coordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs on 17 August 1978 though an informal Hong Kong-Macau affairs group had formed much earlier. Its founding memo described the group's aim as \\"seek truth from facts, approach things appropriately according to the situation, do not assume what works in the mainland will work elsewhere, be flexible.\\" In order to deal with increasingly serious July 1 marches in Hong Kong in 2003, then Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) member and Vice President Zeng Qinghong became leader of the group that year, and China's policy towards the SARs underwent significant reforms. Most notably, the group enacted the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) and the Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, preferential trade agreements, and the Individual Visit Scheme, which allowed mainlanders to visit Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis without having to apply for group visas or go through officially approved tour groups.

He studied the sciences of the Sharia and the Arabic language, and he preached at the Umayyad Mosque and taught in the corner of Al-Ghazali. He was famous for his knowledge until he reached out to students from the country, which led to his incarceration. He then migrated to Egypt, where he was appointed a judge, and he taught and advised, and was appointed to preach at the Mosque of Amr Ibn Al-As, and incited people to fight the Mongols and the Crusaders, and participated in jihad himself. He died in Cairo in the year 660 AH (1262 AD). العز بن عبد السلام، محمد الزحيلي، الطبعة الأولى، 1412هـ-1992م، دار القلم، دمشق، ص39  Birth and education  Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was born in Damascus in 577 AH. He received his education in Damascus by such scholars as Ibn Asakir and Jamal al-Din al-Harastani in Sacred law, Sayf al-Din al-Amidi in usul al-Fiqh and theology, and Tasawwuf with Suhrawardi and Abul Hasan al-Shadhili. Imprisonment In Damascus, as sermon giver (khatib) of the Umayyad mosque, he openly defied what he considered to be unsanctioned customs followed by the other sermon givers: he refused to wear black, refused to say his sermons in rhymed prose (saj) and refused to praise the princes. When the ruler As-Salih Ismail made capitulatory concessions to Theobald during the Barons' Crusade, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam condemned him from the pulpit and omitted mentioning him in the post-sermon prayer. He was consequently jailed and upon release emigrated to Egypt. Egypt Having left Damascus, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam settled in Cairo where he was appointed chief judge and Imam of the Friday prayer, gaining such public influence that he could (and did) command the right and forbid the wrong with the force of the law. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam later resigned from the judiciary and undertook a career as a teacher of Shafi'i law at the Salihiyya, a college founded in the heart of Cairo by al-Malik al-Salih which had then barely been completed and which was, in Egypt, the first establishment providing instruction in the four rites. The biographers indicate that he was the first to teach Qur'anic commentary in Egypt. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's exploits eventually earned him the title Sultan al-'Ulema (Sultan of the scholars). Name and Lineage According to the consensus of scholars and the consensus of the approved sources, His name was Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Salam bin Abi Al-Qasim bin Hassan bin Muhammad bin Mudhahb.العز بن عبد السلام، محمد الزحيلي، ص40-41 طبقات الشافعية الكبرى، تاج الدين السبكي، هجر للطباعة والنشر والتوزيع، الطبعة الثانية، 1413هـ، ج8 ص209 الشيخ عز الدين بن عبد السلام، علي الصلابي، ص6 Works He produced a number of brilliant works in Shafi'i jurisprudence, Qur'anic jurisprudence tafsir, methodological fundamentals in Sacred Law, formal legal opinion, government and Sufism though his main and enduring contribution was his masterpiece on Islamic legal principles .

It is located one-and-a-half miles north of the centre of Workington on the A596, and four-and-a-half miles south of the town of Maryport. It is named after Dunmail, a legendary king of Cumberland. Construction began in 1986, following the purchase of the site by J Dixon & Son, Ltd on land near Siddick ponds which had been in use since the late 19th century for mining and iron working. The iron works previously on the site had, at one time, employed 5000 workers. Dunmail Park opened to the public in 1988, and is open Monday-Saturday from 07:00 until 23:00, and on Sundays from 10:30 until 23:00. However, individual shop opening times vary, and with the exception of the supermarket, most do not open before 09:00. Shops By far the largest shop in terms of floor space at Dunmail Park is Asda, a supermarket, which took over the largest unit after previous anchor tenant Dixon's moved to a smaller unit in the shopping centre in 2010. When it opened, Asda employed 330 people from Workington and the surrounding area. Other shops include Dixon's Homestore, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Mr Simms, Wallis and Topshop, all of which sell clothes and shoes, Cumbria Travel, an independent Travel Agent, Get Threaded, a hairdresser and beautician, and Toytown, a toy and games retailer. Costa and Subway have outlets at Dunmail Park, and café called The Terrace Cafe is also present on the upper floor of the shopping centre, with seating for 120 diners and serving main meals (including Sunday lunches) as well as lighter café fare. Finally, there is a petrol station and a Hyundai car dealership on the site. The shopping centre puts on a special event in November and December as Christmas approaches, with a Father Christmas-themed area for children as well as decorations. Plaza Cinemas Dunmail Park gained one of its biggest attractions in 2001, with the opening of Plaza Cinemas, a multiplex cinema. An independently-owned cinema, Plaza shows most of the major films released in the UK, as well as occasionally independent films and recordings of opera and ballet performances. Parking and public transportation The interior of Dunmail Park looking back toward the entrance. Asda is to the right, other shops to the left. The cinema is directly behind the camera. Dunmail Park has 475 car parking spaces available for visitors. It is served by several bus routes along the A596, which run to several locations, including Workington and Whitehaven to the south, and Maryport, Aspatria, Wigton, and Carlisle to the north and east. The number 60 bus, operated by local company Reay's, runs from Workington to Skinburness, and calls at Maryport, Allonby, Dubmill, Mawbray, Beckfoot, Blitterlees, and Silloth-on-Solway, providing residents of these smaller communities a public transportation link to the shopping centre. Workington North railway station Following the 2009 flooding in Cumbria, which saw several road bridges in and around Workington destroyed, a temporary railway station, Workington North, was built on the opposite side of the A596 from Dunmail Park. In addition to regular services along the Cumbrian Coast Line, an hourly shuttle service was commissioned between Maryport and Workington. However, Workington North railway station closed in October 2010, after slightly less than a year of operation. The nearest railway station to Dunmail Park is now the main Workington railway station.

Joan was the first person in history to fly solo around the world at the equator, the first person to complete the longest single solo flight around the world, the first woman to fly a twin-engine aircraft around the world, the first woman to fly the Pacific Ocean from west to east in a twin-engine plane, the first woman to receive an airline transport rating at the age of 23, and the youngest woman to complete a solo flight around the world. Joan had attempted to become the first woman to circumnavigate the globe by herself, but another woman, Jerrie Mock, set off during the same week and would complete the task earlier. Joan was an accomplished and experienced pilot. By the age of seventeen, Joan had already obtained her private pilot's license and soloed for thirty-five hours. At seventeen, Joan was also the youngest entrant in the All Woman's International Air Race. By age twenty- three, Joan became the first woman to achieve the Airline Transport Rating (ATR) at the minimum possible age. In 1960, she married Lt. Commander Marvin \\"Jack\\" Smith, Jr. After completion of her historic world flight in 1964, Joan was involved in two plane crashes following some 8,500 hours of logged flying time with zero accidents. In the first, Joan was forced to make a crash landing in the California desert on January 9, 1965 when her electrical system caught fire. A few weeks later on February 17, 1965, Joan tragically died at age 28 when the light aircraft that she was piloting out of Long Beach Airport crashed into the San Gabriel Mountains near Big Pines, California, killing her and foreign news correspondent, Trixie Ann Schubert.\\"Joan Smith, World Flyer, Killed in California Crash\\", Chicago Tribune, February 18, 1965, p1 She posthumously received the Harmon Trophy for Outstanding Aviatrix of 1964, which was announced by then Vice President Hubert Humphrey at the White House.

It was developed in Berkshire, England, United Kingdom, by crossing the Cox's Orange Pippin with a Worcester Pearmain to get the optimum positive traits from both parents. This was actually what happened. It received the high eating qualities for which the Cox's is notable: a firm white flesh which is also juicy, a little sharp in taste, but well balanced with sweetness and aroma. From the Worcester it took the best part of its horticultural adventures: easy to grow, reliable crop and resistant to many diseases. In appearance, it is usually conical in shape, medium-sized, a greenish background flushed with much bold red. It is very good in storage; harvested in December it will keep to April, and even improves its taste somewhat by keeping for some time after picking. It is one of the few apple cultivars that are self-fertile, meaning that it can set fruits with its own pollen, and doesn't necessarily need outcross pollination. It has earned the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1993.

Jackson had threatened to go to the tabloids with her claim she was Cosby's illegitimate child unless Cosby paid her $40 million USD. Jackson's disputed paternity claim against Cosby resurfaced in the media in 2014, as a result of sexual assault allegations against Cosby. Paternity Autumn Jaquel Jackson was born to Shawn Thompson Upshaw on September 20, 1974. The paternity has been disputed. Jackson and her mother have claimed that comedian Bill Cosby is Jackson's father while Cosby has denied the claim. In 1997, Cosby admitted to having an extra-marital affair with Upshaw in the 1970s. Upshaw also disclosed the affair with Cosby to the media in 1997, per interviews by the tabloid Daily Mail and the National Enquirer. In 2005, following sexual assault allegations against Cosby from an athletics director at Temple University, Jackson's mother alleged that she became pregnant with Jackson after Cosby allegedly drugged and raped her. This allegation received renewed attention in 2014, when other women claiming to have been raped by Cosby came forward. Jackson's mother claims she had consensual sex with Cosby prior to the alleged rape, but she alleges the last time they were together, Cosby spiked her drink and raped her. Upshaw claimed that when she later found out she was pregnant, she knew Cosby was the father as he was the only man she was sexually active with during that time period. According to Jackson's mother, when Cosby was told she was pregnant, he persuaded her to put her former boyfriend Jerald Jackson's name on the birth certificate. She claims she agreed to do so to protect Cosby's reputation. Upshaw expressed concern that no one would believe her account as she first made her allegations to the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer in 2005. Jerald Jackson claims to be Jackson's father and is listed on her birth certificate as her father. Additionally, Jesus Vasquez, who is an ex-husband of Upshaw, has also claimed paternity. Jackson's mother claims she never had sex with Vasquez, who was a Mexican immigrant and former busboy. Cosby says he paid over $100,000 over 20 years to keep the affair with Upshaw secret. The money went to a trust fund for Jackson, paid for Jackson's car, and her college tuition. While she was in college at Tallahassee Community College in Florida, Jackson says she and Cosby talked on the phone approximately 15 times. Cosby required that in order for Jackson's tuition to be paid, she was to maintain a B-average. When Cosby learned in April 1995 that Jackson had dropped out of college, he stopped having funds released from her education trust fund. Cosby reports he had told his wife about the affair but was concerned with what the media would do with the information. Following new sexual assault allegations against Cosby in 2014, questions surrounding Jackson's paternity resurfaced in the media. In November 2014, former NBC employee Frank Scotti said he helped Cosby by providing women Cosby liked with up to $2000 per month, claiming one of those women was Jackson's mother, Shawn Upshaw. Extortion, conviction, prison In 1997, Jackson, along with two others, attempted to extort $40 million from Cosby in exchange for not going to the press with her claims of being his daughter. At the time, Jackson was living in Burbank, California. Jackson believed the leverage she held over Cosby was that his public and professional image would be damaged if the affair and disputed paternity claims were revealed. Jackson was contacted by Cosby's lawyer who warned her that what she was doing constituted an extortion attempt. Jackson persisted, and sent Cosby a copy of the $25,000 contract she had negotiated with The Globe to sell her story. Cosby's lawyers contacted the FBI, who covertly contacted Jackson using the guise of a settlement agreement. Jackson was persuaded to come to New York for the purposes of a sting operation devised to gain proof of extortion on her part. Jackson was subsequently arrested on January 20, 1997. During the ensuing trial, Cosby was represented by attorneys Jack Schmidtt; Paul A. Engelmayer; and Lewis J. Liman, son of Arthur L. Liman, while Jackson was represented by Robert Baum. On December 12, 1997, Judge Barbara S. Jones of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found Jackson guilty of threatening to injure another person's reputation with the intent to extort money, traveling across state lines to promote extortion, and conspiring to commit extortion. She was sentenced to 26 months in federal prison. When Jackson began her sentence at the Dublin Federal Correctional Institution in April 1998, she was six months pregnant with twin boys. Their father was Jackson's then-boyfriend, now husband, Antonay Williams of Perry, Florida. Williams raised their sons while Jackson was in jail. In June 1999, after serving 14 months of her sentence, Jackson's conviction was overturned and she was released from jail, pending a retrial. She was also barred from contacting Cosby. In November 1999, Jackson's conviction was reinstated by the same court of appeals. It has been suggested by legal experts that if Jackson had negotiated the original terms through a lawyer rather than acting on her own, she would have been able to avoid extortion charges and reach a settlement with Cosby. While citing Jackson's case as such an example, Eric Dezenhall described the nature of the legal strategy as \\"wrapping an extortion threat in a legal cloak.\\" Criminal defense attorney Gerald B. Lefcourt stated that \\"Threatened lawsuits, and even filed lawsuits, are often no more than blackmail.\\" Personal life As a young woman, Jackson had aspirations of attending UCLA with the intention of studying film. Before the extortion case, Jackson worked for Spanish filmmaker José Medina and his production company. Jackson met Antonay Williams while both attended university at Tallahassee Community College in Tallahassee, Florida. On October 18, 1997, at Clearlake, California, Jackson married Williams in a private ceremony. On the marriage certificate, Jackson's father is listed as \\"unknown\\". As of 2014, Jackson works as a kitchen and bathroom designer and lives in Maryland.

Inaugurated in 1887, the quaysides are considered an important milestone in the development of Zürich. The construction of the lake fronts transformed the medieval small town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to a modern city on the Lake Zürich shore. The project was managed by engineer Arnold Bürkli.  Geography  The quays are situated in the districts of Enge, Seefeld and Wollishofen at the lower Lake Zürich shore within the city of Zürich. The complete construction includes, among others, the central Bürkliplatz on the outflow of the Lake Zürich, and (from west to east coast) Saffa-Insel, Strandbad Mythenquai, Belvoirpark, Mythenquai, Arboretum, General-Guisan-Quai, Sechseläutenplatz, Utoquai, Seebad Utoquai, Seefeldquai, Riesbach Harbour, Centre Le Corbusier, Blatterwiese, Chinagarten, Zürichhorn and Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen. The lower lake basin also houses four of the huge Prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zürich of the transnational 111 serial sites. The majority of the important sites of the Horgen culture are situated on lakeshore, including: Grosser Hafner on a former lake island; Kleiner Hafner on a peninsula at Sechseläutenplatz, at the outflow of the Lake Zürich; and Alpenquai, located within an area of about in the city of Zürich.  Further points of interests   Blatterwiese  Blatterwiese is a wide and popular neighborhood meadow situated between Seefeldquai and Zürichhorn, established in 1839 as a fabrication area, and since then also used as on open public lido. In 1926, the city government acquired the land and broke down the factory building. In 1939, it was the site of the Swiss National Exhibition Landi39, and was also used for the G59 exhibition in 1959. After the horticultural exhibition, the open parkland was taken over by the city government and transformed to a large playground. Between Blatterwiese and Bellerivestrasse, in 1993, the Chinese Garden Zürich was inaugurated. The new Spielplatz Blatterwiese began construction in October 2006 and opened in June 2007. Coordinated with the transformation of the adjacent playground, the former partially underground cable car station of the G59 exhibition was rebuilt with a ZüriWC public toilet. The Centre Le Corbusier (or Heidi Weber Museum), an art museum dedicated to the work of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, is situated opposite of the playground.  General-Guisan-Quai  The Alpenquai on the left bank – renamed General-Guisan-Quai after Henri Guisan in 1960 – was created as a terrace-like promenade for the urban population, and four rows of trees were planted. On occasion of the renovation in 2003, the 20th century asphalt-covered surfaces were restored to the original gravel pathways. The original trees, three rows of double-flowered Aesculus hippocastanum Baumannii significantly characterize the appearance of the place. To maintain the same basket-like crown as the elderly chestnut, the young trees are capped at their historical model of the main trunk, the runners are moved to the desired quirl-like crown. In combination with the intervening series of trumpet trees of the species Catalpa bignonioides and Catalpa ovata, the image of a compact roof tree is achieved. Works of art from three generations adorn this path segment: the sculpture of Ganymede by Hermann Hubacher (1959) on the so-called Bürkliterrasse (named after Arnold Bürkli) at Quaibrücke ; the fountain bowl of pink concrete by Christoph Haerle (2003, popularly known as female Ganymede); and the mosaic fountain by Alfred F. Bluntschli (1903) to the east at the Arobetum.  Hafen Enge  The Hafen Enge, meaning the harbour area in Enge, is situated between the Arboretum and Strandbad Mythenquai. The harbour itself is used as a private-owned marina. There is a restaurant, Quai61, and a very popular snack bar at the parking facility adjoining the Arboretum, also housing a ZüriWC. The harbour is in three sections, beginning at the Arboretum. At the parking facility and towards the Mythenquai there are four boathouses, typically for members; on the parking facility at the Mythenquai lido, it is permitted to park private boats in the winter season. The most popular sculpture there is the so-called Züri-Leu, a colossal statue of a lion (renewed in 2013), situated at the publicly accessible wave-breaker.  Hafen Riesbach  The Hafen Riesbach, or Riesbach harbour area, is situated between Seefeldquai and Blatterwiese. The harbour is used as a private-owned marina. In 2004, the old kiosk at the popular open lido at Riesbachstrasse was replaced by a building with a windowed face. The new polygonal pavilion was designed by the architects Andreas Furrimann and Gabrielle Hächler, and now houses a small restaurant and an annexed ZüriWC public toilet. The colour of the windows is reflected by the surroundings, and the pavilion is illuminated in the evening hours. The original seawall front is long, and was renovated in 2003 and 2006 but not fully renewed due to risk of collapse; thus the natural stone dry wall was rebuilt in the same way. The Seefeldquai is an important milestone in the work of the landscape architect Willi Neukom, as it combines park designs from different design periods. The stone pillar Klausstud originally stood in the lake and served as a border designation of the medieval right of bann (boundary) of the city republic of Zürich. It marked where fishing rights of the urban fishermen ended, and from here the Einsiedeln Abbey pilgrims proved their honour to the Protestant city by lowering the volume of their prayers and songs. Since the landfills in the construction of the quais, the pillar stands in the middle of the park. The sculpture by Henry Moore is named Sheep Peace, and was donated in 1976.  Landiwiese  Named after the Landi39 exhibition, various public events continue to be held here. These include the camp of the Circus Knie when it stages at Sechseläutenplatz, numerous youth events, Zürcher Theater Spektakel, the SAFFA (Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work) in 1958, and the popular artificial island Saffa-Insel that is connected by a small bridge for thousands of people who like to swim or have fun there. Landiwiese includes a large open meadow with a smaller hard court for sports, and is home to valuable old trees. The festival site is part of the last replenishment on the left lake shore; in 1939, it was named for the Swiss National Exhibition (Landesausstellung), and expanded to its present size. Mädchen mit erhobenen Händen is the most remarkable sculpture at the area; a work of Hermann Haller, created in 1939.  Mythenquai  Otto C. Banninger's Gottfried Keller memorial (1964) is situated at the Wabengarten, a honeycomb water installation, one of the few relics of the 1959 garden exhibition, G59. It had been constructed for a temporary exhibition, so reductions for bad foundations and water loss occurred in the less-dense pools. A few steps from the shore there's another rare plant in Zürich, Taxodium distichum having pneumatophores, originating from Mississippi River up to Missouri. At the marina, Alnus glutinosa were planted after the flood of May 1999, and because the high water table in the vicinity of the lake gets better than their commitments, a group of Paulownia tomentosa. In 2004 the city council (Stadtrat, Zürich's executive organ) decided to develop a master plan for this area of the lakeside promenades. Because the adjacent lake police (Wasserschutzpolizei der Stadt Zürich) planned a new building, and the public access to Mythenquai had to be reorganized, a general upgrading and redevelopment of the whole area was planned, extending to the parking facilities and Strandbad Mythenquai, Zürich's only sand-beach lido.  Seefeldquai  The Seefeldquai consists of the popular and historic promenade between Utoquai and Feldeggstrasse at the lakeside environment of the 1970s, leading to Lindenstrasse, opposite of the Mythenquai. It is the southernly extension of the long promenades from Utoquai, having a mix of beaches with sand and gravel areas. Due to fluctuations in the water level, some shore sections had to be secured with boulders. The upright stone pillar Klausstud, named after Saint Nicholas, was the former Bann (boundary) of the medieval city of Zürich, situated near the Riesbach harbour. The 1864-built bathhouse was closed in 1887, but as a substitute of the former Riesbach local authorities approved the construction of two new baths, Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen and Seebad Utoquai. From 1975 to 1977, the waterfront between Feldeggstrasse and Lindenstrasse was redesigned by the landscape architect Willi Neukom. The park was designed with pools, hills and sandstone blocks, and smooth transitions to the private property in the present Seefeld district. The curved routing at the Utoquai roadway, one of the busiest in Zürich, has been set in deliberate contrast to the orthogonal orientation of the paths towards Zürichhorn and Blatterwiese, and was paved with period- typical hexagonal stones. The trees have been integrated into the new design and supplemented with unusual flora, such as beech and hanging pyramidal elms, rhododendrons and azaleas, additional shrub and rose plantings, irises, grasses, and bamboo. In 1999, it was replaced by a more transparent planting, and in 2007, the park area was again upgraded with rose plants.  Utoquai  The Utoquai is situated between the effluence of the river Limmat and Bellevueplatz (respectively the Sechseläutenplatz (Kleiner Hafner) squares), with the Seefeldquai adjoining to the southeast. The promenade was built in 1887 and planted with chestnut trees as a lawn towards the Seebad Utoquai. It was formed as a high seawall with a wrought iron railing, and small stairs leading to the lake's shore. Traffic planners urged a masterplan be developed in the 1960s, which called for the adjacent Bellerivestrasse to be broadened due to the rapidly growing road traffic. The historic lakeside promenade was to be shifted, and construction implemented in 1971 effected a new promenade on concrete piles directly above the water level. However, the project plans were not fully realized, and the waterside path of the 1970s became an additional part of the existing promenades, preserving the chestnut trees of 1887 and resulting in the present, wide promenade. In 2006, the historic seawall was renewed, and the Utoquai's design is now of different time periods. As the old bathhouse had to make place for the construction, the then-independent municipality Riesbach built two new bathing facilities: Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen (1886) and Seebad Utoquai (1890). The latter was a \\"bathing palace\\" on stilts with delicate, tower-like structures in the Moorish style. For the first time in Zürich, it was permitted for men and women to bathe in the same place. In 1942, the towering domes were enhanced by the construction of wooden sun terraces, and the basic structure of the original bathing room is still preserved. The Utoquai figures in Inventar der schützenswerten Gärten und Anlagen von kommunaler Bedeutung, being the inventory of estimable gardens and grounds of local importance that was established in 1989.  History  Bellevueplatz, Quaibrücke, Bürkliplatz, Bauschänzli, Münsterbrücke, Rathausbrücke, and Weinplatz (aerial photograph by Eduard Spelterini, probably late 1890s) The site of the former Kratzquartier accommodation and Bauhaus district at the Bauschänzli (today's Stadthausanlage) was extended in 1833 by landfill with rubble of the baroque city fortification along the lake shore. This also marked the end of the medieval Kratzquartier as the distinctive urban axis, extending from Zentralhof, Kappelerhof, and Münsterhof towards the Bürkliterrasse, once home to the underprivileged citizens of Zürich. The medieval quarter had been thoroughly overhauled between 1836 and 1900, and was entirely demolished for the purpose of building a modern lakeshore city. The population welcomed the decision of the city of Zürich and the independent municipalities of Enge and Riesbach to construct the planned lakeside promenades on 4 September 1881. The project, which comprised the whole lower lake basin by the Zürichhorn close to the Enge port, was a considerable financial risk for the three communities that were involved. Smart financing models and the \\"unwavering optimism of the early years brilliantly mastered this challenge\\". The large-scale land reclamation works began in the area of Utoquai in the 1860s, requiring a total of 24.1 million cubic meters (850 million cu ft) of stone material and lake mud for an area of about . This was brought in by ship and introduced by machines specially designed for this purpose. The typical procedure was to construct a breakwater and then backfill it with less-stable lake marl. Railway construction and excavations of tunnels and cuts in Riesbach also provided material, and municipalities and private organizations were invited to deposit rubble, being compensated for large quantities. Arnold Bürkli- Ziegler gave up his position as city engineer to be the chief engineer and coordinator of the project. The construction work began in late 1881, with plans to present parts of the quays at the Swiss national exhibition of 1883. But the whole coastal zone had to be transformed in a time-consuming and costly process in public ownership. Previously, nearly the entire lake area was inaccessible to the public, as the shore land belonged to private owners. A comtemorary commented: \\"Zürich had a lake, but it [the city] did not see it, and his position [for the public] was almost a secret.\\" The inauguration was held in July 1887, and Quaibrücke became the link between the left (Limmat downstream or southerly) and right side of the lake. The elegant promenade of Utoquai, Bürkliterrasse (Alpenquai), and the General-Guisan-Quai lined up on the right side of the lake. The Arboretum, as a spacious park facility, became the southerly connection towards Mythenquai and present Wollishofen. The Swiss National Exhibition in 1939 initiated the further extensions of the existing plan. A monorail was built between the two shores of the lake, but was taken down shortly after the exhibition. At Zürichhorn, the popular tourist restaurant Casino Zürichhorn was removed temporarily to provide space for the buildings of the exhibition, one of which was preserved as the Fischerstube restaurant. In the 1950s, on the fallow area between the railway station Tiefenbrunnen and Zürichhorn, the Seebad Tiefenbrunnen lido was erected; in the 1960s, the new building of the restaurant Lakeside and the Centre Le Corbusier were built. As part of the horticultural exhibition 1959 (G59), Seefeldquai underwent important changes: the present natural embankment design in the English landscape style between Riesbach harbour and Zürichhorn, the removal of nearly century-old trees, and the replacement of all embankments with sandstone slabs and stones. In the mid-1960s, at the height of the Riesbachstrasse harbour area, some owners sold their property at Seefeldquai; in its place emerged several corporate offices and the private clinic Seepyramyde. The last extension was the Chinagarten Zürich at Zürichhorn.  Literature  * Gartenbiografien: Orte erzählen. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, ETH Zürich, Zürich 2013, . * Roman G.

The service relies on mobile phone applications and their Global Positioning System capabilities to match inventories and consumer demand. Launched in 2011, Postmates is one of many on-demand delivery companies in the United States providing delivery from restaurants and stores that previously did not offer goods delivery. Postmates is an example of an on-demand company. Postmates co-founder Bastian Lehmann calls the company \\"anti-Amazon\\". On July 6, 2020, Uber announced it would acquire Postmates for $2.65 billion. History Postmates was founded in 2011 by Bastian Lehmann, Sean Plaice, and Sam Street and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Postmates was part of Angelpad's first accelerator cohort.. Postmates early investors include from Uncork Capital, Russell Cook, Naval Ravikant, Matrix Partners, David Wu, AngelPad, Thomas Korte, Carine Magescas and Andy McLoughlin.. In December 2014, Postmates opened its application programming interface to merchants to allow small businesses to compete for delivery of consumer goods with larger companies such as Amazon. In the same month, the company announced that it had completed its millionth delivery and that it had over 6,000 drivers in its network. In June 2015, Postmates announced that it had surpassed 2.5 million deliveries across 28 markets and expanded its fleet to 13,000 couriers. In September 2015, Postmates updated the app, which added the ability to track delivery, gift meals to others, and the estimated delivery time. In November 2017, Postmates launched service in Mexico City, its first location outside the United States. It ceased operations in the country in December 2019, citing a lack of growth and desire to focus more on the U.S. market. In 2018, Postmates launched service in 134 new cities in the United States, bringing its total number of cities in the United States up to 550. In September 2018, Postmates announced that it has raised $300 million in additional funding led by Tiger Global Management. Fortune reported that the deal valued Postmates at $1.2 billion. On December 13, 2018, Postmates unveiled Serve, its internally developed autonomous delivery rover. In January 2019, Postmates raised $100 million investment by BlackRock together with Spark Capital, Founders Fund, Uncork Capital, and Slow Ventures. The total valuation of the company reached $1.85 billion. In May 2019, Postmates changed its pay structure for delivery workers, removing a $4-per-job minimum pay guarantee, changing the base rate per job, and changing the per-mile rate in some markets. Working Washington, a labor activism group affiliated with the SEIU labor union, urged couriers to refuse jobs with Postmates. The company defended its modified pay structure, citing improved efficiencies and its policy of allowing workers to keep all tips without counting them against other compensation. By mid 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic where demand for services delivering items surged, Postmates announced it was offering a selection of non-contact delivery options for customers. The company also encourages customers to report if their Postmate appeared sick when delivering. Controversy and Criticism  Allegations of monopolistic behavior In April 2020, a group of New Yorkers sued DoorDash, GrubHub, Postmates, and Uber Eats, accusing them of using their market power monopolistically by only listing restaurants on their apps if the restaurant owners signed contracts which include clauses that require prices be the same for dine-in customers as for customers receiving delivery. The plaintiffs state that this arrangement increases the cost for dine-in customers, as they are required to subsidize the cost of delivery; and that the apps charge “exorbitant” fees, which range from 13% to 40% of revenue, while the average restaurant’s profit ranges from 3% to 9% of revenue. The lawsuit seeks triple damages, including for overcharges, since April 14, 2016 for dine-in and delivery customers in the United States at restaurants using the defendants’ delivery apps. The case is filed in the federal U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York as Davitashvili v GrubHub Inc., 20-cv-3000. Although a number of preliminary documents in the case have now been filed, a trial date has not yet been set.

The song received a promotional video, shot at the Dunas do Rosado Environmental Protection Area in Porto do Mangue, a municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, where the group comes from. It was released on 8 October 2013, with an exclusive premiere at Tenho Mais Discos que Amigos! website.  Composition and lyrics  The song was named \\"Dino vs. Dino\\" due to its introductory guitar riff, which reminds the band of the steps of a big dinosaur. The track, guitarist Rafael Brasil's favorite, had already been performed live numerous times, but in demo forms with improvised lyrics. The song's lyrics talks about an argument one of the female members of the band had with a great friend of her. More specifically, such friend revealed a \\"sordid\\" story involving that member to other people, a story of which he also took part but tried to redeem himself. The first verse of the track shows the friend's version of the story, while the chorus shows the member's version, explaining that he is also to blame and that she didn't act like that when it was him to be the protagonist of a sordid story. According to bassist Edu Figueira, the member and that friend are already in good terms again.  Video  Dunas do Rosado, where the video was shot. Originally, the band intended to release just a lyric video, but co-director Cléver Cardoso convinced Brasil to make a complete video since he considered the track \\"too good for just a lyric video\\". The project was canceled as the people involved feared it would be a failure, but it was later revived. The idea of recording the video at Dunas do Rosado, in Porto do Mangue, was to play with the band's name. Cardoso commented: During the shooting sessions, which lasted from 3:30 am to 6pm, the band and the Granada Filmes production team faced cars jammed in the sand, sandstorms, insolation, rain, thorn bruises from the only available tree, guitar pedals buried and lost in the sand, among other problems.

In earlier eras, when information was scarce and access to information was power, organizations structured themselves along chains of power and authority, with those higher in the organization having more knowledge and therefore more power. These structures disintegrated as the Internet made a huge spectrum of information and knowledge freely available. The term wirearchy was coined in 1999 by Jon Husband, who defined it as \\"a dynamic flow of power and authority, based on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results, enabled by interconnected technology and people\\".Husband, Jon (2013). \\"What is Wirearchy\\". Hugh MacLeod illustrated the basic concept of wirearchy by showing links emanating from the classic hierarchical pyramid.  History  Power structures related to knowledge and information date back to early tribal systems, in which the tribal head was noted as the holder and keeper of knowledge. As tribes evolved into cities and countries, power evolved as well, into the hierarchical pyramid. Medieval churches and feudal kingdoms continued this arrangement of scarce knowledge and control of information at the top. Even with the arrival of the printing press and the resulting increase in the ease, speed, and affordability of disseminating information, the spread of knowledge remained relatively slow for centuries, and the hierarchical structure continued to thrive. The flow of knowledge began to radically accelerate in the 1990s with the emergence of the Internet. Members of many organizations began to connect and share with others through hyperlinks, social media, and easy self-publishing platforms. The availability of these tools led to increased social interaction around knowledge. Traditional hierarchies assumed that leaders higher in the system had better information for making decisions, and that it was in the followers' interest to allow them to make the decisions. The Internet and the ability of organizational members to connect with anyone both inside and outside the organization—and to find information both inside and outside the organization—disrupted this traditional notion of power. Power and authority came to be based less on hierarchical position and more on knowledge sharing, trust, credibility, and end results. The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in his book The World Is Flat that the web allowed individuals to be global players in much the same way that company structures of the 1800s and political structures of the Renaissance did.Friedman, T. (2005) The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, Farrar, Straus and Giroux.  Consequences  As a design principle, wirearchy means that information flows differently in networked organizations than in traditional hierarchical structures. Knowledge in a networked context flows horizontally, based on connections and collaborations, rather than in official up-and-down streams. Problems that involve formal meetings and memorandums in hierarchical organizations can instead be solved, for example, with a tweet, blog post, or web conference. In the past decade, the web has become more open, social, and participatory. Project work, analysis and planning, research and development, and other knowledge-intensive work has shifted from formal face-to-face settings to an array of web-based wikis, blogs, RSS feeds, and social networking. This, David Weinberger wrote in his book Everything Is Miscellaneous, allows socially networked work groups to \\"co-create\\" knowledge with an ease not possible in a traditional hierarchy.Weinberger, D. (2007) Everything is Miscellaneous, http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/ Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and maker fairs are examples of this new organizational model. In \\"The Internet of People for a Post-Oil World\\", Rob van Kranenburg and Christian Nold posit that the rise of the \\"Internet of Things\\", coupled with distributed workers, will disrupt the current business models for commercializing technologies and developing products, and that the lines between issues, people, and technology will continue to blur.Van Kranenburg, R. (2008) The Internet of Things. A critique of ambient technology and the all-seeing network of RFID, Network Notebooks 02, Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2007. Tom Austin, a vice president at the market research firm Gartner, said in a press release in 2010:Gartner, Inc. (2010) \\"Gartner Says the World of Work Will Witness 10 Changes During the Next 10 Years\\". > Work will become less routine, characterized by increased volatility, > hyperconnectedness, \\"swarming\\" and more.

In addition, simulation, visualization and > unification technologies, working across yottabytes of data per second, will > demand an emphasis on new perceptual skills. The concept of wirearchy holds that the Internet and its associated networks are moving the world away from the \\"master-servant\\" archetype of the Industrial Age to a more open, social, and collaborative relationship, forcing leaders to consider the scope and reach of interconnected markets and flows of information.

History  The Saint-Francis Hospital was founded by the congregation of the Grauwzusters from Zoutleeuw on 20 October 1925 when the head of the Franciscan order in Heusden-Zolder asked for a hospital for the local miners. This is how the hospital got its name. The construction of the hospital started in 1927 and in that same year, the hospital was able to take care of 30 people. An operating room, a pharmacy and a washhouse were added in 1928. In 1932, a room for radiodiagnosis was added. During World War II, in 1941, the hospital was extended with another hall that could fit 30 patients, as well as a delivery room. A maternity department was added in 1952 and in 1957, an internal medicine department was added. Finally, the hospital was extended with a pediatrics department. After these works, however, renovations and more specialised medical departments were needed in the hospital. On 19 December 1973, Jos De Saeger (Belgian minister of Public Health, Family and Environment) agreed on the hospital's proposal of its extension with another 84 beds. However, problems with the bad condition of the building due to mineshaft cave-ins underneath the hospital obstructed these works. On 20 May 1975, Rik Vandekerckhove agreed on new terms to replace the old building with a new one with 224 beds. Because of the Royal Assent (French: sanction royale) of 1 July 1982 that the number of beds could not be higher than 150, a new hospital with this smaller number of beds was built. It first opened on 25 September 1985. After the fusion with the Saint-Anna Hospital of Beringen (Dutch/Flemish: Sint-Annakliniek) in 1990, the hospital had 230 beds. On 1 October 1993, the hospital opened the first department for day hospitalisation. In 2005, large parts of the hospital were renovated and restructured. In 2008, the hospital started with the building of new departments and specialized areas, such as a geriatrics department and two new operating rooms, and with the renovation of older parts of the hospital buildings. These works lasted until 2011. On 1 July 2009, the hospital had 244 beds available for all kinds of patients.Over SFZ, Historiek ().

Belonging to the Visingsö Parish of the Church of Sweden, it was opened in 1636 as Wisingsborg Castle Church (). Brahe Church was erected as a royal church at the beginning of the 17th century. A church built in the Middle Ages, Ströja Church, already existed on its site at that time. Ströja Church was built in the 12th century and was then the royal church. At the beginning of the 17th century, Count Magnus Brahe built a new church on the foundation of the medieval Ströja Church. All that Magnus Brahe retained from the older church was the beautifully ornamented door to the sacristy, which probably originally stood in the main entrance of Ströja Church. However, Magnus Brahe didn’t have time to experience the church’s completion. It was his nephew Per Brahe the Younger who inherited the building and dedicated the new church in 1636. The church is a spacious hall church in the Renaissance style. It is made of clay slate, sandstone and limestone, and its roof is covered with copper that was donated by a sister of Per Brahe the Younger, Christina Brahe. The splendidly decorated church serves as a museum, art gallery and curios cabinet as well as a place of worship. A visit to Brahe Church presents a picture of the splendor that once was characteristic of Sweden’s largest countship, Visingsborg.

In a racing career frequently interrupted by injury he raced twenty-one times in eight seasons, winning eleven races. Despite an undistinguished pedigree, he showed promise in his early career, winning the Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle in 1995. He reached his peak in the spring of 1999 when he won the Victor Chandler Chase and the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He was retired from racing in January 2001. Background Call Equiname was a grey gelding bred in the United Kingdom by Mrs L Steele. He was by far the most notable horse sired by Belfort, a moderate racehorse and an obscure breeding stallion. Call Equinames dam, Cherry Season, won one minor race from fifteen starts in 1982 and 1983. As a yearling, Call Equiname was sent to the Doncaster bloodstock sale in September 1991 and bought for 1,500 guineas by Don Eddy acting on behalf of Karen McLintock. Although it was originally intended to use the horse for dressage, he was trained for racing by Eddy at his stable at Black Heddon, Northumberland. According to the Encyclopedia of British Horse Racing, Equiname was a company set up to allow advertisers to name a horse without actually buying one and Call Equiname was intended to act as their \\"mobile advertisement\\". Throughout his racing career, Call Equiname's efforts were compromised by a series of injury problems: the Racing Post described him as having \\"legs like glass and a heart of oak\\". Racing career 1993/1994 season: National Hunt flat races Call Equiname made his racecourse debut in a National Hunt Flat race at Musselburgh Racecourse on 7 January 1994. Starting at odds of 5/1 in a fourteen-runner field he accelerated clear of his opponents in the last three furlongs to win by fifteen lengths from Benbeath. After finishing second when favourite for a similar event at Doncaster Racecourse three weeks later he ended his first season in a National Hunt flat race at Ayr Racecourse in April. Starting the 7/4 favourite, he led from the start and won by six lengths from Sparky Gayle. In May 1994 Call Equiname was sent back to the Doncaster sales and was bought for 64,000 guineas by Paul Nicholls who moved the gelding to his stable in Somerset. For the remainder of his racing career, Call Equiname was owned by Paul Barber in a variety of partnerships. In his early days at Nicholls's yard Call Equiname was extremely aggressive: according to Robin Oakley he was \\"almost certainly responsible\\" for the death of the highly promising chaser See More Indians (winner of the Feltham Novices' Chase) who was euthanised after his leg was \\"shattered\\" by a kick from Call Equiname. 1994/1995 & 1995/1996 seasons: Novice hurdles On 28 October 1994, Call Equiname made his first appearance as a hurdler in a novice event at Wetherby Racecourse. He jumped poorly and finished fourth of the nineteen runners behind Callisoe Bay. On his only other appearance of the season, he started favourite for a similar even at Newbury Racecourse in March but was beaten four lengths by the 66/1 outsider Raqib. Having failed to win in the previous season, Call Equiname was still eligible to compete in novice hurdle events in the 1995/1996 campaign and had his most active season, racing seven times and ridden in all of his races by Tony McCoy. On 30 September 1995, he recorded his first win over obstacles when winning at Chepstow Racecourse, beating Speedwell Prince by half a length. He was then matched against more experienced hurdlers in a handicap race at the same course in November and finished unplaced behind Lightening Lad under top weight of 167 pounds. A week later, the gelding was then moved up in class for the Grade 2 Flowers Fine Ales Novices' Hurdle and finished second of the twelve runners behind the Josh Gifford-trained Mandy's Mantino. On 1 December, Call Equiname conceded ten pounds to nine opponents in a novices' event at Sandown Park Racecourse and won by four lengths from Crack On. Two weeks later Call Equiname started the 7/4 favourite for the Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle at Ascot Racecourse. McCoy sent the favourite into the lead at the second last flight of hurdles and Call Equiname prevailed in a closely contested finish, winning by a neck and a short head from Speedwell Prince and Strong Promise. On 23 February 1996 Call Equiname started 4/7 favourite for a novices' handicap at Kempton Park Racecourse. Carrying top weight of 162 pounds he took the lead at the fourth hurdle and drew away from his rivals to win by twenty lengths from Peace Lord. In March, Call Equiname ran for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival when he contested the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and started 10/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Castle Sweep, Kimanicky and Dance Beat. He was never in contention and finished eleventh of the twenty-seven runners behind the Jenny Pitman-trained Indefence. 1996/1997 season: Novice chases In the 1996/1997 season Call Equiname was campaigned in novice steeplechases and was unbeaten in an abbreviated campaign which comprised only two races. At Chepstow on 5 October he was ridden by Richard Dunwoody and started at odds of 4/5 for a two and a half mile novices' event. He won by eighteen lengths from Sonic Star, the only one of his three opponents to complete the course. Three weeks later in a similar event at Worcester Racecourse he was reunited with McCoy and won by one and a half lengths from Fine Thyne at odds of 8/13. 1997/1998 & 1998/1999 seasons: Steeplechases On his only appearance of the 1997/1998 season, Call Equiname was matched against more experienced chasers in the Mitsubishi Shogun Trophy Handicap Chase at Chaltenham on 14 November 1997. Ridden by Timmy Murphy, he took the lead at the second last fence and won by a length from Time Won't Wait. When Call Equiname appeared for the Victor Chandler Chase at Kempton on 23 January 1999 he was running for only the second time in more than twenty-six months. Ridden by Robert Thornton he started at odds of 15/2 in a seven runner field. After being restrained by Thornton in the early stages he made progress from the seventh fence and took the lead from the favourite Get Real at the final fence. Get Real regained the advantage on the run-in, but Call Equiname rallied to retake the lead in the final strides to win by a neck. On 17 March, three years after his previous appearance at the Festival, Call Equiname returned to Cheltenham to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Ridden for the first time by Mick Fitzgerald, who was given the ride ahead of the less experienced table jockey Joe Tizzard he started the 7/2 second favourite behind Edredon Bleu in a thirteen runner field. The other contenders included Papillon, Direct Route (1998 Tingle Creek Trophy), Hill Society, Ask Tom (1997 Tingle Creek Trophy), Celibate (Game Spirit Chase), Mulligan (Arkle Novice Chase) and Or Royal (Arkle Challenge Trophy). Fitzgerald positioned the gelding towards the middle of the closely bunched field as Edredon Bleu set the pace. He jumped the second last in fourth but then made rapid progress on the rail on the final turn and entered the straight in second place before moving up to challenge the favourite at the final fence. Call Equiname overhauled Edredon Bleu a hundred yards from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths, with Direct Route a further three and a half lengths back in third place. After the race Fitzgerald said \\"Any race here is good but when you win them they're even better. He was fantastic but he was stopping in front\\". Commenting on the horse's chronic leg problems, Nicolls said \\"Call Equiname has given us plenty of headaches and has been pin-fired, bar-fired and implanted.\\" On the same subject, one of his co- owners said: \\"We bought him as a four-year-old, he's now nine and he's had bad shins for the last five years\\". Call Equiname started the 11/10 favourite for the Melling Chase at Aintree Racecourse in April but after a making a jumping error at the fourth last fence he sustained his first defeat in over three years as he finished third behind Direct Route and Mulligan. Later career In November 1999 Call Equiname carried top weight of 164 pounds in the Murphy's Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Cheltenham and started the 3/1 favourite. He was never in contention and was tailed off when pulled up by Fitgerald four fences from the finish. According to the racecourse vet the horse was \\"distressed\\" after the race and was found to be suffering from an irregular heartbeat. When carrying 168 pounds in a handicap over the same course and distance in December, the gelding weakened badly in the closing stages and finished last of the four runners, again ending the race in a distressed condition. After a break of over ten months, Call Equiname returned in the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter Racecourse on 31 October 2000 and finished third behind Bellator and Upgrade. Retirement In January 2001 Call Equiname was retired from racing. Nicholls commented \\"On his day he was top- notch. He has been a great servant to us and a privilege to train, even if he has suffered from recurring injury problems\\".

The film originally premiered as the ABC Friday Night Movie on February 2, 1979. Synopsis \\"The Girls in the Office\\" are four young women working in the office of the new Nayfak's department store in Houston where the action centers around the quartet as they search for professional success and future husbands while balancing their jobs with their love lives: * Rita Massaro is an ambitious woman hardened by her past who is determined to have a better, more prosperous life, and is willing to do anything she thinks will help her get it; her vicious and unscrupulous manipulations of events and co- workers eventually backfire. * Lee Rawlins is a dedicated office manager who reconciles strife between employees and supervisors; she is a career woman and a long-time employee of Nayfak's old department store whose conservative attitude has kept her from fulfilling her life. * Karen Heineman is a secretary and Tracy Beaumont is the office coffee girl; they are both Rita's co-workers and roommates who, despite their youth and inexperience, soon learn to stand up for their rights. Ben Nayfak is a pioneer who rose from shirt peddler to tycoon and, as his crowning glory, is determined to build the world's grandest department store. In addition, Beau Galloway is head of the construction crew at Nayfak's who falls in love with Lee; Mike Holden and Bill Pearson are the two right-hand men to Mr. Nayfak jockeying for top position.

The title refers to Keeping Up with the Kardashians and the Kalashnikov rifle. Background Howard finished writing the book on Valentine's Day 2014, and named it Raiders of the Lost Dork, a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark and the insult dork. A month before publication, the title was changed to Keeping Up with the Kalashnikovs, as the original title was considered an outdated reference. Plot Fionn is taken captive while teaching at a school in Uganda. Ross and the guys go out to rescue him. Meanwhile, Sorcha has given birth to triplets and Honor is more difficult than ever, acting as Pied Piper to a troupe of rats. Release To promote the book, Penguin Ireland erected \\"blue plaques\\" at sites in Dublin significant to Ross. Keeping Up with the Kalashnikovs was the best-selling fiction book in Ireland for Christmas 2014, and it saw the book series pass the million-copy milestone. It sold 25,431 copies in the year 2014. It was nominated for the Books Are My Bag Popular Fiction Book of the Year Award at the 2014 Irish Book Awards. Reception In The Irish Times, Peter Murphy praised Keeping Up with the Kalashnikovs, saying that \\"Line by line [Howard] is an inventive, lively stylist, one whose grasp of the opposing rhythms of the northside and southside Dublin demotic is up there with Roddy Doyle’s.\\" and that \\"the most effective chronicler of the frappuccino, cheese and vino years was not some superhip social realist but a working-class former journalist, Paul Howard, writing as an upper-middle-class grotesque.\\" On Writing.ie, Declan Madden praised it, saying it was \\"a little darker then [sic] previous titles […] but had plenty of laugh out loud moments and was full of Ross’ usual humour.\\" In the Irish Independent, Ian O'Doherty wrote that \\"There's an old rule in TV comedy that once you start sending your characters on exotic holidays, you're close to jumping the shark. After all, Ross is effectively a sitcom […] It's certainly an unusual departure for a character so associated with First World problems, and it stretches the character to its limits.\\" He later added that \\"transplanting [Ross] to the rather murky world of jungle terrorism and Somalian pirates was certainly a stretch. Keeping Up With The Kalashnikovs was undoubtedly his oddest book yet.\\" References Category:2014 Irish novels Category:Penguin Books books Category:Ross O'Carroll-Kelly Category:Novels about kidnapping Category:Novels set in Uganda Category:Piracy in Somalia Category:Fiction set in 2012 Category:Fiction set in 2013 ","title":"Keeping Up with the Kalashnikovs"},{"id":"44869164","text":"The Lands of Tour and Kirkland (NS416406) formed a small estate close to the old Kirktoun and St Maurs-Glencairn collegiate church about 1 km south-east of Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire, Parish of Kilmaurs, Scotland. The word 'Tour' in Scots refers to a 'tower' and 'kirk' to a parish church.Scot's Dictionary History Jocksthorn Farm from the Kilmaurs Kirkton The name 'Tower', changed to 'Tour' in the 1900s, as used nowadays for the nearby estate and the old monastic area below the glebe, derives from the old buildings of the collegiate church community dwellings that lay below this church, once described thus : \\"It is a high strong-built house, consisting of several apartments; ... most likely the clergy had this for their residence.\\" It is recorded that the collegiate church had a provost, six to eight prebendaries and two choir boys and therefore a fair amount of accommodation was required.Dobie, Page 285 The slightly rectangular shaped tower itself stood close to the surviving dovecot dated 1630 and still stood to a significant height as late as 1912, however it is now almost at foundations level as most of the old tower was removed to make it safe in the 1990s.A History of KilmaursMcNaught, Page 128 Beattie records that the tower had a narrow entrance and a flagged floor with at ground level what appeared to be facilities for washing or bathing.Beattie, Page 9 The dovecot appears to be an adapted survival of an earlier monastic building as witnessed by the medieval carving of a face at the bottom of one of the crow-stepped gables.Pleasance, Page 24 The old dwelling is locally said to have been used by Huge de Morville lived here whilst Kilwinning Abbey was under construction and was last occupied in the 1660s. The Prebendary lands of the 'Tower' and the prebendary mill, once associated with the financing of the community, came to around 80 acres.McNaught, Page 116 Known as Kirk Fauld in 1967 it was previously known as Tour Gardens Farm.Patience, Page 23 The old collegiate church buildings would have been made use of in some way by the Cunninghames of Robertland from the time they acquired the lands in the 1530s as was usually the case following the Reformation in Scotland. The dovecot or doocot at the site has the date 1636 however the lower section has been tentatively dated to the 10th century as part of the collegiate church complex of buildings. Kirk lands at the time of the Reformation in Scotland were often returned to the representatives of the founding families and this was the case at the collegiate church of Kilmaurs which returned to the CunninghamesSanderson, Page 21 of Robertland, granted by the Abbot and Convent of Kelso in 1532, in the person of David Cunninghame. The lands remained with that family until the 19th century.Paterson, Page 475 By the time of the Reformation the kirk lands of Kilmaurs had already been leased out to Cunninghame of Robertland, surprisingly for a smaller sum than the absentee minister could have expected to receive from the petty kirk dues.Sanderson, Page 20 Kirkland House is located off the Kilmarnock road on a lane that also runs up to the old manse that stands on the hill to the west overlooking the Tour policies. Kilmaurs Castle The old kirk of St Maurs with the Glencairn Aisle prior to alterations and the addition of the bell and clock tower. Adamson relates in 1875 that the ancient castle of Kilmaurs was in the vicinity of Jock's or Jack's Thorn farm, now 'Jocksthorn' and several old people from Kilmaurs in 1875 remembered playing amongst the ruined remnants of masonry which occupied the site of this old castle of the Cunninghames.Adamson, Page 168. Adamson also talks of the typical woodland policies of such a dwelling still existing in the 1870s with venerable old trees, what sounds like roundels of trees, avenues that may have defined lanes or rides, etc. All of these are not normally associated with farms and he appears to clinch the argument of the castles site by describing the \\"..sward covered circular mound\\" or motte at the 'traditional' site. Roys military map of the area dating from the 1750s indicate a large area of probable woodland/land that is not being cultivated where Kilmaurs Castle is said to have once stood. Armstrong's map of 1775 indicates a castle-like building at the supposed site although the name 'Jock's Thorn' appears to be linked with it.Armstrong's Map of Ayrshire. Metal detectorists have found a number of medieval coins in this area amongst what may be old building and foundation stones. The 19th-century 6 inch OS Map of Kilmaurs marks the supposed site of Kilmaurs Castle as lying off the side of the farm road leading to Jocksthorn Farm from the old Stewarton Road. William Aiton's map of 1811 showing the ruins of Kilmaurs Castle near Jocksthorn. Dobie in 1874 that the old baronial residence was about a mile South-East of Kilmaurs and ruins could still be pointed out on the farmlands of Jocksthorn. He goes on to say that this could have been the 'Villam de Cunninghame', the original residence and first possession of this ancient family.Dobie, Page 289 The traditional site therefore of another 'tower', Kilmaurs Castle, as opposed to Kilmaurs Place, is located to the north-east of Tour, just off the entrance to Jocksthorn Farm that connects with the Stewarton road via Grassmillside Farm and Shaw Bridge. The map by Timothy Pont from circa 1600 marks Kirkland with no reference to Tour.Cuninghamia / ex schedis Timotheo Pont ; Ioannis Blaeu excudebat. Cunningham. Tours House first appears as 'Towers' on Robert Aitkens mapAitken of 1829 and on also John Thomson's 1832 map in a small woodland bounded enclosure.Thomson's Map of 1832 Tour House and estate In the Statistical Account of 1791-99 James Watson was the owner of the tower and its old monastic Cistercian buildings, separated from the church by a garden, \\"laid out with excellent tafte, efpecially of the kind that is favourable to retirement and meditation.\\" This suggests that the dwelling was at this site at this time. ;The mansion house and grounds The RCAHMS records that Tour is a castle-style, two-storey mansion, rebuilt about 1841. The office wall is terminated by a crow-stepped garden house which was a dovecot at one time.RCAHMS Canmore Site McNaught's Map of Kilmaurs Parish. Close states that a rubble built barn dated 1636 has a dovecot built into one end in the 19th century. Love records that James Ingram was the architect for the alterations to the mansion house.Love, Page 128 The B-Listed 1841 mansion house was rebuilt by Robert Parker Adam of Brazil, a Glasgow merchant. It is a two-storey building, ashlar, constructed with a castle-like appearance. The central two-storey porch projects with a Gothic doorway. To the rear are sited octagonal corner turrets. A crow stepped garden house is a modified dovecote or doocot.British Listed Buildings A number of outbuildings are increasingly shown on OS maps. Close and Riches regard Tour as having been enlarged for Robert Adams rather than rebuilt, the existing building having been added to already in 1823 by the Cathcarts.Close & Riches, Page 652 Internally the mansion house, recast in the 1840s \\"has a plaster-vaulted porch with stiff- leaf bosses, an interior hall, its cornice and ceiling panel with fleuron detail, opening through a Tudor-arched screen to the staircase which is also set behind a screen. The well stair has a flat candelabra-like cast-iron balusters and a plaster-panelled, coved ceiling with a central octagonal roof- light.\\" An escutcheon carved on the building at Tour is thought to be the coat of arms of the Cathcart family. The remains of an ice house are located near the house, close to the Tour Burn that runs down to the Carmel Water via the Lady's Well. The burn is shown with a dam upstream of the ice house, creating a pond and a source of ice in the winter.RCAHMS Record The one surviving traditional Gate Lodge is located at the main entrance to Tour House.RCAHMS Record A second gate lodge was once located at the second entrance to the estate on the Kilmarnock side of the estate. The surviving Tour lodge house. A private gas works and gasometer were located at Tour in 1856 as indicated by the OS maps. Mr Cathcart is recorded to have greatly improved the property with plantations in the early 19th century. A walled garden with several associated greenhouses dating from at least the 1850s is located to the east of the mansion house and has a late 18th-century over its entrance. The 1856 OS map indicates a Summer House and bowling green located on the east side of the walled garden.Ayrshire, Sheet XVIII. Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1860. An isolated building in a patch of woodland near the mansion house in 1895 has the appearance of a summer house. The 1937 OS map still shows a feature in front of the house that may have been a bowling green or a tennis court.Ayrshire, Sheet 018.05. Publication date: 1938. Revised: ca. 1937 ;Curling pond Within the screen of the woodland policies near the south gate lodge was a large rectangular curling pond in an area known as 'Fauldfield' with no obvious source of water other than the small Woodhill Burn near the old Sandyford Cottage. All that remains is the depression in the ground. The OS maps show it to be present in 1897 and 1911, however by 1938 it is no longer annotated as a curling pond. In the Kilmarnock Standard 19 April 1913 its construction is described and it is referred to as the 'Kilmaurs artificial' curling pond.Royal Caledonian Curling Club Accessed : 2014-12-28 ;The estate First shown in the 1750s as 'Sandy Ford' in 1856 a dwelling known as Sandyford, located near the Kilmaurs to Kilmarnock road is shown for the last time, located in a patch of ground just on the Kilmarnock side of the Woodhill Burn at the southern extremity of the Tour woodlands. A significant ford could have been present before field drainage work over the years altered the drainage pattern; this burn has a confluence with the Carmel Water. In 1889 the estate was sold by the Adams family in two portions, with David Dunlop of Fenwick purchasing Bellsland and Jocksthorn whilst Kirkland, the mansion-house and policies were sold to a Mrs Pollock of Barrhead. In 1904 a former Rangoon merchant, J. G. Findlay, became the proprietor at Tour.McNaught, Page 22 Lady's Well The Tour dovecot. The Lady's Well The Kilmaurs Glencairn church Minister (2007), the Rev. John Urquhart, has been informed by the locals that the well is named after the wife of an owner of Tour House who daily came to collect the cool water. Mr. Findlay of Tour is recorded by McNaught as having enjoy the never failing water, of excellent quality, and refreshingly cool on the hottest day of summerMcNaught, Page 117 as late as 1912. An opening in the ashlar estate wall opposite the entrance to Tour House near the Gate Lodge allows direct access to the woods in which the well is situated near the now demolished hamlet of Pathfoot, marked on the 1750s Roy's map as 'Old Yard'.Roy Military Survey of Scotland, 1747-55 The repairs on the well using a concrete slab as part of the roof and the ashlar walling appear to have been carried out within the last century. The original path down to the old hamlet of Pathfoot or 'Old Yard' was located slightly to the east before the short section of typical ashlar 'estate' boundary wall was built.Ayr XVIII.5 (Kilmaurs). Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1860. Lairds of Tour and Kirkland The ownership and history of the lands of Tour and Kirkland were at many points in time intertwined. Hugh de Morville of Burgh by Sands in Cumberland held the whole of the lands of Cunninghame from King David I, a 12th-century ruler. Warnebald, also from near Burgh by Sands, held the Manor of Kilmaurs and took the name 'Cunninghame'. Warnebald's son Robert inherited and he gave the patronage of Kilmaurs church and half a carucate of land to the monks of Kelso.Dobie, Page 283 In 1403 Sir William Cunninghame founded and endowed the collegiate church of Kilmaurs. Kirklands Farm from the old St Maurs Manse. David Cunninghame was granted the church lands of 'Kirkland-Kilmares' by the Abbot and Convent of Kelso in 1532, including the portion of land called 'Garnell Croft'McNaught, page 22 and in circa 1604 it had passed to William Cunninghame, designated of \\"Touer-lands\\". In 1572 a James Cunninghame of 'Tourlandis' is recorded.McNaught, Page 21 In 1698, William Watson, Senior baillie lived at Tour House and the Findlays lived at the estate in the early 1900s. In 1976 Dr and Mrs McAllister dwelt lived here. It has been suggested that the 'Tourlands' in the 1640s were held by James Hay, son of James Hay, however Towerlands near Bourtreehill may be the property concerned. In 1676 a James Cunninghame of Tour is recorded.Dobie, Page 379 In 1572 David Barclay of Kirkland is recorded, the son of William Barclay of Perceton. in 1586 John Cunninghame, son of Patrick Cunninghame of Kirkland was a party to the murder of Hugh Montgomerie, 4th Earl of Eglinton at Stewarton. Archibald, designated of \\"Kirklands\\" died in 1614 and left six children, Patrick, David, Archibald, Adam, Bessie and Margaret. David is referred to in 1630 and Patrick in 1633 as a feuar of Kirkland, suggesting that the brothers jointly held the property. In 1634 Archibald of Kirkland was succeeded by his eldest son. In 1645 a Patrick Cunninghame, married to Elizabeth Henderson died.Paterson, Page 476 William Watson in 1694 is recorded as the proprietor, possibly through marriage and the lands stayed with the family until 1814 when the line ended with an heiress who married William Cathcart of Carlton, formerly of Jamaica. James Watson, Esq. was a Greenock based merchant who was the proprietor of 'The Tower' circa 1791 - 1799.The Statistical Account, Page 374 Sir John Cathcart, Bart of Tours is recorded in the heritor's minutes of 1836. George James Cathcart, cousin to William, inherited in 1841 and a Glasgow based merchant, Robert Parker Adam, purchased the property. Margaret Haldane of Auchans was his spouse and his eldest son William Parker Adam inherited.Paterson, Page 477 Tour woods and St Maurs- Glencairn church from the site of Kilmaurs Castle. In 1889 the estate was sold by the Adams family with Kirkland going to David Dunlop of Fenwick and the mansion-house and policies being sold to a Mrs Pollock of Barrhead. In 1904 a former Rangoon merchant, J. G. Findlay, became the proprietor of Tour.McNaught, Page 22 Prehistory A copper alloy flanged axehead was found in a ploughed field (NS419404) and was deposited in Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum.RCAHMS Record A Carved Stone Balls of fine-grained sandstone, 2.5 inches (64 mm) in diameter, with the surface ornamented by six equal, circular and slightly projecting discs was found at Jock's Thorn Farm (NS 417 410).Marshall, Pages 4–72. History David Cunninghame, son of Patrick Cunninghame of Kirkland, was created a baronet in 1633 as Sir David Cunninghame of Auchenharvie.Robertson, Page 274 The house was advertised for lease for the 1839 Eglinton Tournament and at that time was stated to have three public rooms and six bedrooms.

This printing house was operational until 1566 and printed two srbulje books, The Four Gospels (Четворојеванђеље) in 1562 and The Flower Triod (Триод Цветни) in 1566. In 1567 the Ottomans destroyed the church and its printing house.  Location  Today the exact location of this printing house is unknown. There are different theories about exact location of the monastery and its printing house, but all of them agree that it was somewhere near Kosjerić. One of the most possible locations is above the county house and mouth of the river Kladoroba and Skrapež.  Printing  The books created in the printing house were edited and printed by Hieromonk Mardarije. According to some sources, it was Mardarije who inspired first Dmitrović and then Gundulić to invest in a printing business and organized all activities during the set up of the printing house in Belgrade. Some sources explain that Mardarije moved a printing press from Belgrade to Mrkšina crkva monastery. Two books were printed in the Mrkšina crkva printing house: * The Four Gospels (Четворојеванђеље) in 1562 and * The Flower Triod (Триод Цветни) in 1566. The Flower Triod is recognizable because in this book Mardarije preferred to use figural motifs instead of the ornaments. This book was printed on 1 September 1566 by Hieromonk Mardarije, priest Živko and deacon Radul. This was the last book printed in the Mrkšina crkva printing house in 1566.  Aftermath  In 1567 the Ottomans burned the church and its printing house, while the monks fled to Rača monastery, similar to monks from Rujno Monastery printing house who fled there after 1537. After the printing house became defunct in 1566, no other such operation existed in Ottoman Serbia until 1831.  Legacy  Two copies of the Four Gospels printed at Mrkšina crkva are still preserved in the Monastery of the Holy Trinity of Pljevlja, one copy in Monastery Ždrebaonik and two in Cetinje Monastery. A street in Kosjerić heading to the supposed place of the Mrkšina crkva is named Zoupan Mrkša.

The main farmstead, including a house and barn, were built in 1914 after the 19th- century farmstead was destroyed by fire. The property represented a virtually intact and well-preserved early 20th-century farmstead of rural Maine, and was stylistically distinctive because not very much new farm construction took place at that time in the state. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. This farmstead, including the historic house and barn, was destroyed by fire in 2013. It was removed from the National Register in 2015. Description and history The Burgess farm began in 1834, with the purchase of by William Burgess, who erected a log cabin on the property before eventually building a frame house. He transferred his property, a successful operation which included a small dairy herd and a flock of sheep, to his son John O. Burgess in stages between 1860 and 1877. Almost the entire farm complex was destroyed by fire on December 23, 1913, by which time the operation of the farm had been taken over by John's son Walter and his wife Eva. An ell was built onto a surviving blacksmithy to provide temporary living space for the family while a new house and barn were built. Both the house and barn built by the Burgesses included recent innovations not found in many farms in rural Maine, because agriculture was generally in decline. The barn was a large structure with a gambrel roof, a western innovation that improved hay storage capacity, and the larger number of milking stations indicated that the farm was shifting to an increased emphasis in dairy production. The house was a two-story frame foursquare structure, with a hip roof. A single-story hip-roofed porch, supported by Tuscan columns, spanned the front and wraps around to one side. The interior retained original varnished woodwork. An ell joined the house to the barn. The entire complex was engulfed by an accidental fire, probably started by sparks in the barn, and destroyed in July 2013.

It is a bridging or transitional brainstem reflex that is an important developmental stage and is necessary for a baby to transition from lying on the floor to quadruped crawling or walking. In order to progress beyond this development stage, the baby needs to have been successful in unlinking the automatic movement of the head from the automatic movement of the arms and legs. The STNR is normally fully developed by 6–8 months and significantly diminished by 2–3 years. If this reflex is retained beyond 2–3 years to such a degree that it \\"modifies voluntary movement\\", the child is considered to have \\"immature and abnormal reflex development\\", and this can have broad effects on the child's later development. Testing The symmetrical tonic neck reflex can be tested by placing the child in quadruped position on the floor and passively flexing the head forward and then extend it backwards. The expected response would be forward head flexion producing flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities while extension of the head will produce extension of the upper extremities and flexion of the lower extremities. Significance This reflex can help the child to come to quadruped or crawling position but does not allow crawling because when the neck flexes forward, the upper limbs flex and lower limbs go into extension. This reflex is not normally easily seen or elicited in normal infants but may be seen in an exaggerated form in many children with cerebral palsy.

Their style was characterized by grotesque gags on everyday life and caricatures of famous people. The trio made their first television appearance in 1978 on a program by José María Íñigo, and due to their success they repeated four times. Fernando Conde left the group in 1985 to dedicate himself to the theater, but Josema Yuste and Millán Salcedo continued to act together until 1997. Origins Millán and Conde met in the military service in Santander (Cantabria), where they already played brief \\"performances\\" among peers. Subsequently, they met Yuste at the School of Dramatic Arts in Madrid and they came with the idea to form a comedy group. Career They debuted on the small screen in 1979 in the program Fantástico, hosted by José María Íñigo. During the next two years, they appeared frequently on entertainment shows such as Aplauso. Narciso Ibáñez Serrador initially selected them to play the role of \\"Los Tacañones\\" (The Stingy Ones), an antagonist role for his famous quiz show Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez. They filmed a program, but he later decided to let the role to Las Hermanas Hurtado, still Martes y Trece appeared as comedians in the show. They were a regular part of the New Year's Eve TV specials on TVE. Performing sketches based on public figures, they generally parodied contemporary television and radio. The most famous was the \\"patty sketch\\" of 1985, about a confused mother calling radio host Encarna Sánchez while frying small pies to talk about her two sons and their military service in Móstoles. The lady, never seen on stage, mixed up all the details of her conversation and even said that she was frying the two sons and that Móstoles was on fire. In 1988 they were the hosts of ¡Hola, hola 89! They continued to make New Year programs, initially written by themselves and directed by Rafael Galan. From 1989 until the group split in 1997 (except in 1993, replaced by Cruz y Raya) they recorded: A por uvas (1989), ¡Venga el 91! (1990), El 92 cava con todo (1991), Martes y 13 en directo (1992), ¡Fíjate! (1994), A Belén pastores (1995), Emisión Imposible (1996) and Adós (1997). In 1990 they were also the hosts of the Twelve Grapes in Puerta del Sol. However, they also made specials outside New Year's Eve such as A ver, A ver (1991), Que te den concurso (1992) and Vísperas y Festivos (1995). TVE granted the group their own weekly show, Viéndonos, combining performances with comic sketches. There were 18 episodes. They conducted a surreal interview with Madonna in 1992. In 1994 they had another, less successful, weekly program El retonno.

The Hartley family The Ascension window at Hexham Abbey - hand made with Hartley Wood glass John Hartley of Dumbarton, Scotland, moved to the Nailsea, near Bristol, England, in 1812 and began working with Robert Lucas Chance at the Nailsea Glassworks. On 1 April 1828, he transferred to the British Crown Glass Company manufactory at Oldbury (then Worcestershire), which had been bought up by Robert Lucas Chance in 1824. By 1832 British Crown Glass was experimenting with the new sheet glass manufacturing method, which required French workers to make it and this was not favoured by Hartley's two sons, James and John. After John Hartley Snr. died in 1833, the two brothers were taken into partnership by Robert Lucas Chance in 1834 and the firm became known as Chances and Hartleys in 1834. In 1836 the Hartley brothers left Chances and Hartleys (which then became Chance Brothers and Company) due to differences of opinions regarding the viability of sheet glass. The brothers then moved north to Sunderland to set up their own business. The reasons why Sunderland was chosen as the site for their new venture are unclear, but it may have been because other family members (uncles and cousins) were already established in the glass making industry there. Packing shed at the Wear Glass Works in June 1889 The Wear Glass Works was established at the junction between Trimdon Street and Hylton Road, Deptford, Sunderland c 1836, trading as James Hartley and Co. Two years later, on 25 November 1838, James Hartley was granted a patent for Hartley's Patent Rolled Plate, manufactured by a new cast glass process, and the firm concentrated on this for the next fifty years. On 1 January 1840 John Hartley conveyed his share of the business to his brother, leaving James Hartley as a sole trader. When James Hartley decided to retire from the business on 31 December 1869, a new partnership was forged comprising the two remaining partners from the existing partnership, together with John's younger brother, Thomas Blenkinsopp Hartley and Hartley Perks Kayll. At this point the Company style reverted to James Hartley and Co. When Thomas Blenkinsopp Hartley died in 1872 the other 3 partners continued the business. On 22 April 1878 John Hartley too retired from active participation in the business, leaving the Kaylls as co-partners. James Hartley died in London on 24 May 1886 and his share of the business was divided between his two surviving sons, James and John. A month after his father's death, James sold his interest in the glassworks to his brother. Although the Wear Glass Works had been very successful for over half a century, in the 1880s business began to decline because new plate glass manufacturing methods developed by rival firms were not adopted at Hartleys. Family wrangling over the will of John Hartley, who died on 6 December 1889, exacerbated the situation, leading eventually to a Court of Chancery order for the sale of the Wear Glass Works in 1892. It was purchased first of all by a Trust which, in 1893, sold it on to a new firm, James Hartley and Co Ltd headed by James Hartley junior, son of John and grandson of James the founder. The Wear Glass Works continued to produce plate glass and James Hartley & Co Ltd continued to exist for several years after the foundation of the Portobello Glass Works, but by 1915 the factory had closed and the firm was wound up. To revitalise the firm, James Hartley decided to develop the manufacture of antique coloured glass which up to this time had been a sideline.  The Wood family  Alfred Wood, a skilled colour mixer was invited to join the Company from W E Chance & Co. Ltd, which he did in 1890. Alfred Wood's father, George worked for Chance Brothers as a colour mixer until 1873 when he left the company to become freelance. In 1882 Alfred Wood suffered a breakdown of some kind which may have been the factor which led him to consider moving elsewhere. In 1892, with the Wear Glass Works failing, James Hartley junior, established a second business making antique coloured glass at the Portobello Glass Works in Portobello Lane, Monkwearmouth. Alfred Wood became his works manager. James Hartley junior traded here as The Portobello Glass Co Ltd until March 1895 when he took Alfred Wood into partnership and the firm became Hartley Wood and Co. On 9 May 1908 the partnership was dissolved and Alfred Wood continued the business in partnership with his son, Alfred John Wood. In 1912 Alfred John Wood and his brother Gilbert Henry Wood bought out their father's share of the partnership and established a new partnership. Alfred Wood died in 1916. In 1914 trade directories describe the firm as manufacturers of antique, ambitty and Venetian glass. Alfred J Wood died on 1 March 1948. The surviving partner, Gilbert Henry Wood took his son, Gilbert Hartley Wood (great-grandson of the founder) as a partner. A year later Allen Alder joined the firm, becoming a partner in 1952. Gilbert Henry Wood retired in 1957.  Closure  The company was taken over by Pilkington in 1982 (Pilkington also acquired Chance Brothers) and ceased operation in July 1989. It resumed operation in 1992 and closed finally in November 1997. The company's records from 1849 until closure are in Tyne and Wear Archives.

The area takes its name from the former Middleton Junction railway station and lies along the course of the Rochdale Canal. It is located 1.4 miles south east of Middleton town centre and 1.9 miles west of central Chadderton. It is contiguous with other areas of Chadderton and Middleton including Moorclose, Mills Hill, Greengate, Alkrington and Firwood Park. Semi rural Foxdenton lies to the east. History The area now known as Middleton Junction originally comprised a number of hamlets situated along Grimshaw Lane and Foxdenton Lane on the border of Chadderton and Tonge townships – Lane End and Hillock (described in the early 1800s as \\"a pleasant hamlet\\") in Chadderton, Bradshaw Fold and Jumbo in Tonge (Tonge was a former township which was incorporated into Middleton in the late 19th century).P 94 Chadderton Chapters (1972), Lawson M, The area around Jumbo was historically part of the estate of the medieval Bradshaw Hall which was demolished in 1910. In the 16th century, the area consisted largely of undeveloped forest and meadow. The Hall was located on the south side of a valley overlooking the Wince Brook. The estate had a corn mill on the river and began to rent land to farmers. In 1777, the silk weaving business was introduced to the area and for the next 50 years there was great demand for hand loom weavers' cottages. The estate rented out land north of the current Grimshaw Lane and the settlements of Jumbo and Bradshaw Fold rapidly grew. The estate was bounded on the south by Wince Brook, the west by Tonge and in the north by Chadderton. The only access to the estate road would have been the lane to Foxdenton Hall, later to become Grimshaw Lane. Two settlements were formed firstly by the home weavers and later by the mill owners. Bradshaw Fold was the area on the north east of the estate, later to be replaced by the station name, Middleton Junction. In the 1861 census, Bradshaw Fold had over 70 weavers' cottages. On the west, between the current Aspinall Street and Sandy Lane, was the village of Jumbo or Jumba. In an 1823 slang dictionary, a jumbo is defined as a clumsy or unwieldy fellow. The origin of this expression is based on a well read travel book, Travels in Africa. It describes a tribal custom in Africa where a witch doctor would dress up and perform a noisy dancing ritual. He was known as Mumbo Jumbo. A letter to the Manchester Guardian in 1862 speculates as to the origins of the name. “….The cottages in the vicinity of Bradshaw Hall are occupied by silk weavers, farm labourers and cotton spinners and commonly known by the singular name “Jumba” which significant title is supposed to be conferred there-on from the jumping gambols and athletic exercises of the residents on Saint Mondays and other holidays.” In 1779, Thomas Chadderton sold the coal rights to the estate which were probably accessed from the Alkrington pit at Lancashire Fold. The Rochdale canal was built shortly after this (1804), greatly easing the transportation of both coal and cotton. JW Lees brewery opened at Bradshaw Fold in 1828.http://www.jwlees.co.uk/about/history> Middleton Junction railway station opened at Lane End on 31 March 1842 with a branch line to Oldham Werneth railway station.

Evans, Oldham, 1841 The station was originally called Oldham Junction but by August 1842 it was known as Middleton Station, changing its name to Middleton Junction some ten years later.P2 An illustrated history of Oldham's Railways, John Hooper, The branch line to Middleton opened in 1857. The station closed in the mid-1960s. The late 19th century gave rise to a substantial cotton spinning district around the area of the station and along the canal and saw terraced houses built along Grimshaw Lane and its environs. Mills included the Junction Mill, Laurel Mill among others. See List of mills in Chadderton The name Middleton Junction was adopted as place-name for the area during this period. Bradshaw Hall and Estate The estate was a key part of the post-medieval manorial system of North Manchester. It was occupied by descendants of the ancient Chadderton family from 1548 to 1820 and comprised a large part of the current Middleton Junction and Jumbo area. The remains of the Hall lie beneath private land off Glenn Grove. Although demolished in 1910, it is of significant archaeological interest as the footprint of the hall has not been built upon and the site may contain evidence of earlier occupation. History of the estate: The first recorded evidence to the Bradshaw area is a 1320 survey of the Barony of Manchester which records a ‘Bruyd-shaw' (Broad Wood) in the vicinity of ‘Alcryn-ton', ‘White Moss', ‘Black-ley' and ‘Nut-Hurst'. An 1839 map confirms the area as Broad Wood whilst later Ordnance Survey maps show both Bradshaw Hall and Bradshaw Fold in the same area. There is a record of the ownership of the land in the will of Robert Chadderton a “Yeoman of Bradshaw Hall” in 1639. It refers to previous owners of the land as; – The Priory of St John of Jerusalem, Roger de Montbegon (d 1266) and the Earls of Derby. Due to the close location to Chadderton Hall, it is likely that Bradshaw was originally part of the Manor of Chadderton which was passed to Gilbert de Notton in 1212 and to Richard de Trafford in 1232. Richard's second son Geoffrey inherited the land and took the name Geoffrey de Chadderton and built Chadderton Hall in the mid 13th Century. The Chadderton manor was passed to the Radcliffe family by 1367 and subsequently to the Assheton family in 1454. The Radcliffes were later to settle in Foxdenton, and the Chadderton family went on to establish both Nuthurst (Moston) and Bradshaw Halls. The Chadderton family can be identified as having a presence in the area of Bradshaw as far back as Edward VI (1547) when Edmund Chadderton was a plaintiff in a civil court action against John Tonge and others for trespass on the common turbary of Tonge Moor. The eastern side of the Tonge manor is bounded by the Irk River and Wince Brook so Tonge Moor must have been the area between Tonge Hall and Bradshaw Hall. Edmund had also begun a property dispute some years earlier in the reign of Henry VIII (1532). This concerned an area south of the Bradshaw Hall site and related to an area known as Theymore Waste (or Theale Moor). The dispute involved the borders of the Nuthurst Waste, Chadderton Waste, Oldham Waste, Moston Hamlet and Ashton Township. The dispute continued for over 70 years with Theymore borders being redefined and a common area left known as the ‘Equals'.(See also 'A Boundary Dispute'). Edmund Chadderton held the smaller of two Halls at Nuthurst which was 2 miles south of Bradshaw Hall. His eldest son was William Chadderton (1540–1608) who became the Bishop of Lincoln and Chester. We find the first reference to Bradshaw Hall in the will of Robert Chadderton in 1639. The ancestry of Robert is unclear but we can assume he is related to the Nuthurst hall branch and Edmund Chadderton's line because of the closeness of the two estates. Roberts's first son was named Edmund and this provides further support to this assumption. Although this is the first documentary evidence of the occupation of the site, the Chadderton family could have been here as early as 1367 following the transfer of Chadderton Hall to the Radcliffe's. Lowbands Farm, Jumbo In 1860, an influential meeting here helped lay the foundations for the development of the Co- operative Wholesale Society. Lowbands Farm was a convenient meeting place for the co-operators from Rochdale, Oldham and Manchester. Six miles south from Rochdale, four west from Oldham and five north from Manchester, the farm was a useful stopping-off point for a country walk. Jumbo is now part of Middleton, lying between Middleton and Middleton Junction. In 1860 it was a hamlet made up of a few farms and the cottages of handloom silk weavers, though the rural characteristics were beginning to disappear after the building of a railway through the area. In 1851 a few cottage workers, manufacturers of velvet waistcoats, decided to get back to the land. They pooled their resources to rent six acres with a house at Jumbo. Previously called \\"Walmsley's\\", the farm was nicknamed \\"Lowbands\\" after a Feargus O'Connor land scheme estate in Worcestershire. The farm made a loss. George Booth was put in charge to try and remedy matters. A Jumbo Co-operative Society was formed to lend a hand and the farm's loomhouse was converted into the new society's store room. Debts and high interest rates took their toll. The farm implements and other assets were sold in 1861, debts paid off, and the stock of the little store turned over to the Middleton Society for £13. 5s. Religion St Gabriel, Middleton Junction is an Anglo-Catholic Church founded in 1885.> Jumbo Methodist Church was located on Grimshaw Lane. It was founded in 1868 and closed in 1967. Grimshaw Lane, Wesleyan Methodist, was founded in 1874 and closed in 1966.

With the development of Middleton Junction following the arrival of the railway a new school became necessary which was opened in 1874 as Middleton Junction Wesleyan School. The school was taken over by Chadderton School Board in 1894.

He served as a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, as Mayor of Highland Park, Illinois, and as a trustee on the North Shore Water Reclamation District. Early life Pierce was born March 31, 1928 in Chicago. His family moved to the North Shore where he graduated from New Trier High School. He earned degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. He served in the United States Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps during the Korean War. While in the Air Force, he attended the United States Air Force Command & Staff School. He then took a position with Altheimer, Gray, Naiburg, Strasburger & Lawton where he would remain for the remainder of his legal career. Illinois House of Representatives In an unusual election, Pierce ran on a statewide ballot after the Illinois Supreme Court ordered an at large election for all 177 members of the Illinois House; the result of partisan gridlock preventing the completion of the decennial reapportionment process. After a 1965 Illinois Supreme Court Case to resolve the redistricting issue, Pierce's Highland Park home was drawn into the 32nd district which consisted of Algonquin, Dorr, Grafton, and Nunda townships in McHenry County and Cuba, Deerfield, Ela, Fremont, Libertyville, Shields, Vernon, Wauconda and West Deerfield townships in Lake County. He was reelected as one of the district's three representatives. During his tenure, he was a member of the Democratic Study Group, a caucus of independent, liberal Democrats. His role in this organization earned him a nominal spot on the leadership team of then-Minority Leader Clyde L. Choate. Pierce served as a delegate for Edmund Muskie in the 1972 Democratic presidential primary. He was in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment. He served as Chairman of the House Revenue Committee, the Mental Health Investigating Committee, the Energy and Environment Committee, the Illinois Economic Fiscal Commission, and the Energy Resources Commission He served on the House Public Utilities Committee and as House Minority Whip for two terms. Pierce explored running for the Democratic nomination for Illinois Attorney General in the 1982 primary, but stepped aside after failing to be slated by the Cook County Democratic Party in favor of Neil Hartigan. Hartigan would go on to beat incumbent Tyrone C. Fahner. In 1983, rather than run for an eleventh term, Pierce chose to retire. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat and former Lake County Clerk Grace Mary Stern. Mayor of Highland Park Pierce was elected Mayor of Highland Park in 1987 and reelected in 1991. In 1995, he was defeated for a third term by Trustee Raymond Geraci. He defeated Geraci in the 1999 election and served a final term from 1999 to 2003. Other political activities Pierce was later the President of the North Shore Water Reclamation District, a position he served in for over a decade. Pierce was also a member of the Central Committee for the Democratic Party of Illinois from Illinois's 10th congressional district.

Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the song with Avicii, Arash Pournouri, Salem Al Fakir, Magnus Lidehäll and Vincent Pontare. An early demo of \\"Rebel Heart\\" as well as the final version, both leaked to the internet prior the album's scheduled release. The final version was made available on March 6, 2015 when Rebel Heart was released. While the demo was a dance song, the album version of \\"Rebel Heart\\" is acoustic and composed in a major key. The recording was generally well received by music critics, who admired the autobiographical nature of the composition where Madonna acknowledges her musical legacy. The song was included on the set list of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), where Madonna performed it in front of a backdrop displaying fan art. She also performed it during a concert in support of Hillary Clinton.  Background and release  For working her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted a large team of songwriters and producers. In March 2014, she uploaded a photo on her Instagram account of a sunset, along with the words \\"Rebel Heart\\" and the caption \\"Day turns into night. I wont give up the fight. Don't want to get to the end of my days... saying I Wasn't amazed! #revolutionoflove\\", which prompted speculation that she was preparing to release a new album or single. In mid 2014, she uploaded a picture that revealed her playing the guitar alongside Swedish electronic musician Avicii. In November 2014, the demo of a song called \\"Rebel Heart\\" leaked onto the internet, resulting in Madonna taking to Instagram and posting a picture of a smashed iPod and explaining, \\"This broken ipod is a symbol of my broken heart! That my music has been stolen and leaked! I have been violated as a human and an artist! #fuckedupshit\\". She described the situation as \\"terrorism\\" and a form of \\"artistic rape\\". The unintended leaks led the singer to release six completed tracks through iTunes as a pre-order for the album on December 20, 2014. The album, also titled Rebel Heart, was leaked online in its entirety on February 3, 2015, more than a month in advance to its scheduled release. The final version was subsequently released only on the deluxe and super deluxe editions of the album on March 6, 2015.  Recording and composition  The final version of \\"Rebel Heart\\" included in the album was changed drastically from the leaked demo, by incorporating an acoustic sound. It was written by Madonna with Avicii, Arash Pournouri, Salem Al Fakir, Magnus Lidehäll and Vincent Pontare and was produced by all of them, except Pournouri. It is sung in a major key, starting off with bright, upbeat guitar sounds according to Amy Pettifer of The Quietus. The song's instrumentation consists of finger claps and a violin. In the autobiographical lyrical content, Madonna acknowledges her legacy in the music business, singing lines like \\"Hell yeah, this is me, Right where I'm supposed to be\\", followed by the chorus. According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \\"Rebel Heart\\" hearkens back to the folk- rock music Madonna had done in the past, but differs due to the usage of finger claps and some \\"brisk strings\\". Kot found that with the lyrics \\"addressing character flaws and missteps with unprecedented candor, [the singer] suggests how a onetime provocateur can mature and still remain interesting, if not remain at the center of pop culture as she once was.\\" Calling it the album's \\"most successful pop moment\\", Evan Sawdey from PopMatters observed that Madonna made numerous references to her past with the lyrics. He listed instances like Madonna's strained relationship with her father, to the singer's narcissistic image in the media. Sawdey also believed that instead of being \\"self-referential\\", the lyrics rather portrayed a more humane side of the singer.  Critical reception  Madonna performing the track during the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016) \\"Rebel Heart\\" received positive reviews from music critics. Pettifer wrote: \\"The last song on the album feels like the first to properly spring into aural life in an unapologetically major key [...] The song relates the story of its singer — who she was and how she became who she is – which is really the record's underlying conceit\\". Pettifer also wrote that the lyrics were \\"more auto-biographical and therefore more interesting\\". Bradley Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, also praised the song's autobiographical lyrics; \\"The message is sincere, vulnerable and undoubtedly true to Madonna's story, the music is strong and that chorus is utterly anthemic. Madonna hasn’t had a truly rich, singer-songwriter, sing- along friendly record in a while — maybe since Music? — so it's kind of unbelievable to hear such a strong melody from the Queen again\\". He called it \\"one of her best songs in a long time\\". Stern preferred the leaked demo over the final original version. Rolling Stones Caryn Grant wrote that \\"the album is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone to the side and just tells it to us straight. So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart — and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it\\". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that \\"it's taken the best parts of Avicii's sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting \\"Avicii feat. Madonna\\" number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'\\". Spin said it was the singer's \\"sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle\\". Q magazine called it a \\"movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years\\". In 2018, Billboard picked it as the singer's 72nd greatest song, calling it \\"a sentimental sing-along that looks back on her bumpy road to stardom, adding some shrugged-off self-awareness (\\"I spent some time as a narcissist...trying to be so provocative/ I said, 'Oh yeah, that was me'\\") to keep things from getting too schmaltzy\\".  Live performances  The song was included on the setlist of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). It closed the show's third segment and featured Madonna, dressed in a gypsy inspired dress created by Alessandro Michele for Gucci, consisting off a shawl, flamenco hat, lace, skirts and jacquard bodysuit, playing the acoustic guitar while the backdrop screens depicted a morph of fan art depicting many images of the singer throughout time. Madonna had previously launched an online contest calling her fans to submit their art for a digital gallery; those chosen winners would have their work displayed as backdrops during the tour. Jordan Zivitz from the Montreal Gazette, wrote that \\"In the concert's second category, none stood out more than Rebel Hearts uplifting title track, presented as a statement of identity and gratitude\\". Conversely, Joshua Ostroff from The Huffington Post found that only few people could sing-along to the track on the tour, thereby proving that the new songs from the album had not connected with the audience. The performance of the song at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour (2017). On November 7, 2016, Madonna performed \\"Rebel Heart\\" as part of an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

The X Party registered towards the end of 2012, and appeared publicly at the beginning of 2013. It was the first party to be founded by a group of people connected to the 15M Movement and other free culture movements. The party supports a model of democracy that is participatory and monitored by everyday citizens, taking advantage of the political potential of tools available for digital communication. Program Its program is based on four pillars: transparency in public management; governmental and legislative power for the people (Wikidemocracy); the right to a real and permanent vote; the application of a binding referendum process. Other characteristics of the X Party are: open electoral lists, the use of crowdfunding for financing, collaborative creation of the agenda, online publication of party's financial activity, a lack of affiliated members and fees, the recognition of free software and creative commons licenses, organization in nodes and networks, the federation of competencies, sequential participation, the use of activist vocabulary and its technopolitical style. History Background The majority of the founding members of the X Party actively participated in the 15M Movement as it became known. In May 2012, the 15MpaRato platform was created, a collective which would later become part of the X Party's Anticorruption Commission. This platform is part of the popular accusation involved in the judicial processes known as the Bankia case [link], The Bankia Preferential Shares case and the Blesa case. Some of the founding members of these collectives came together to form the X Party at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013. Founding Partido X, Partido del futuro (X Party, Party of the Future) was registered in the Registry of Political Parties on the 17th of December, 2012 and in November 2014, the name was modified to, and is currently registered as, the Red Ciudadana Partido X: Democracia y Punto (X Party Citizens' Network: Just Democracy). The members of the party were presented at a public press conference on October 8, 2013. 2014 European Parliamentary Elections The X Party ran for the May 2014 European parliamentary elections. The list was led by Hervé Falciani. Other candidates on the list included Simona Levi, Raúl Burillo, and Juan Moreno Yagüe. They obtained 100,561 votes, 0.64% of the total, which was insufficient to win parliamentary representation. Ideology The X Party is a transversal initiative that cannot be defined ideologically merely on the left-right axis. Rather, it is a method. The party's website states that their goal is to use the party as a means to help move towards a more direct and participative form of democracy, one based on pragmatism and compromise, also known as a \\"pact of minimums\\". Their working method is based on open source principles, free culture and free information. Program The X Party's program adapts to the competencies of the offices in the election in question. Up to this point, it has been adapted for the 2014 European parliamentary elections. The main axis of their proposal, Just Democracy, is based on 4 mechanisms to establish a true democracy where citizens have control over executive decisions and legislation. These mechanisms are: *Transparency in public administration *Government with citizen oversight (Wikigovernment: citizen participation in the handling of public matters) and citizen legislative power (Wikilegislation: elaboration of participatory and transparent legislation). *The right to a real and permanent vote (for all citizens to have the right to vote, if they wish, on all of the laws that are debated in parliament). *Binding and mandatory referendums The X Party has developed two emergency plans that provide solutions to specific problems. These plans, known as the Emergency plan for overcoming the economic crisis and the Specific Emergencies Plan, include proposals for different sectors such as healthcare, education, science and R&D;, housing, energy and the information society. Both plans were based on contributions from organized Civil Society groups such as the Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (Platform for People Affected by Mortgages), the Asociación de Facultativos Especialistas de Madrid (Madrid Association of Medical Specialists), and more. Organization The X Party establishes an organizational structure inspired by the 90-9-1 principle: a structure with five levels based on degree of involvement. Inspired by the nomenclature of free software, the levels are: *Developers *Hub (Kernel) *Matrix *Support *AgendaX This structure is kept open and flexible so that members can change their role according to different principals such as the level of involvement, proven ability, peer recognition, respect and the demands of common goals. Commissions The X Party has created different commissions focused on specific themes in which groups of independent experts advise the party. These commissions are: Science and R&D;, Education, Energy, Healthcare, Information Society, Housing and the Anticorruption Commission and Citizen Control of Financial Flow Commission. Members of these commissions include Manuel Castells, Hervé Falciani and Raúl Burillo, as well as collectives such as 15MpaRato, the Spanish Society of Scientists in the UK (Spanish: Sociedad de Científicos Españoles en el Reino Unido) or CERU, the Spanish Society of Scientists in the Federal Republic of Germany (Spanish: Sociedad de Científicos Españoles en la República Federal de Alemania) or CERFA, the law firm Bufet Almeida and Xnet. Anticorruption Commission This commission is composed of a group of citizens, activists, professionals and experts who work with, in collaboration or as integrated members, the X Party to create secure channels through which they can promote citizen observation. Using these methods, the Anticorruption Commission was able to leak Blesa's E-mails to the press, e-mails from the banker Miguel Blesa which were included in the Bankia case lawsuit. The 'Black' Credit Cards scandal was uncovered as a result of these leaks and led the investigating judge to open a second suit which deals specifically with the scandal. Financing The X Party is financed by donations and crowdfunding. Selection process for the electoral lists The X Party chose its candidates for the 2014 European parliamentary elections through an open and participative procedure that allowed citizens to propose candidates from outside of the party structure who were partnered with people from the organization to form the electoral list. In the elections, the party received 0.64% of the votes and gained no seat.

The Royal Lao Government forces in Military Region 1 of Laos had just been evicted from the crucial all-weather airfield at Muang Soui, as well as most of the Plain, on 28 June 1969. Hmong General Vang Pao planned a quick counter-offensive to recapture the airfield from his communist foe; it would kick off on 1 July, supported by 60 sorties per day of tactical air strikes from Operation Barrel Roll. In the event, the 1 July offensive ran afoul of its Neutralist allies, who retreated rather than carry out their assault. A constant flow of reinforcements from the attacking People's Army of Vietnam fed their own strength to resist. With the Neutralists' abstention, the remaining forces in Off Balance—two battalions of Hmong guerrillas and a Royalist paratrooper battalion— were defeated by counterattacking communist tanks supported by heavy artillery. During the battle, the Hmong suffered the loss of their only fighter pilot, Lee Lue. The reputation he had gained while flying over 5,000 combat missions had become the symbol of Hmong resistance; his death was a crushing blow to Hmong morale. Operation Off Balance ended the day of Lee Lue's burial. The communists still held the Plain of Jars and Muang Soui. Overview After World War II, France fought the First Indochina War to retain French Indochina. As part of its loss of that war at Dien Ben Phu, it freed the Kingdom of Laos. Laotian neutrality was established in the 1954 Geneva Agreements. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors.Castle, pp. 7–12, 15–18. A North Vietnamese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.Warner, pp. 44–47 After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng.Warner, p. 264. They were poised to turn the Hmong army's western flank.Ahern, p. 318. Background Facing an enemy drive that had penetrated within ten kilometers of his main base by the disastrous end of Operation Pigfat, as well as menacing his major air strip at Muang Soui, Hmong General Vang Pao and his CIA backers had fought back. An aerial campaign, Operation Raindance, had sapped enemy strength by its massive destruction of his pre-positioned supplies. However, after it and the following Operation Stranglehold ended, the Hmong guerrillas had swept through enemy ground back to their own territory. It seemed a somewhat successful end to their dry season operations.Warner, pp. 263–265.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 201–212.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 298–302.Ahern, pp. 308–310. As Vang Pao planned a rainy season offensive during late June 1969, the People's Army of Vietnam anticipated him. In its first rainy season offensive of the Laotian Civil War, as well as its first use of tanks in northern Laos, the communists captured Muang Soui on 27 June in Campaign Thoan Thang. Making the threat more serious was the addition of seven fresh communist battalions during the past two months. That brought the total PAVN order of battle opposing Vang Pao to an unprecedented 19 battalions.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 211–214. Operation Off Balance On 28 June 1969, Vang Pao began planning another preemptive attack on the communists in hopes of catching them by surprise; it would be launched three days later on 1 July. The Hmong general proposed rallying the 700 Forces Armées Neutralistes soldiers at Xieng Dat who had fled there from Muang Soui. He would stiffen their will to fight by assigning a couple of battalions of his guerrillas to the operation, some 600 Hmong. Also available was a Royal Lao Army paratroop battalion of 300; the paratroopers were considered the best of the regular troops. With half of the 120 daily Operation Barrel Roll air strike sorties pledged for support, the pincer movement on the ground was supposed to recapture the vital all-weather fighter strip at Muang Soui in ten days.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 213–214.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 304–306. On 29 June, a CIA case officer flew in to Xieng Dat to appraise the combat effectiveness of the Neutralists. He met with a sullen commanding officer, Colonel Sing, who reported the desertion of 50 soldiers the previous night, and claimed to be short of weaponry. On the other hand, when the case officer moved on to the Hmong, the CIA man found Vang Pao personally firing a 4.2 inch mortar at the enemy. The inspection tour left serious doubts as to whether the Hmong had sufficient military power to tackle an offensive by themselves. To further complicate matters, Vang Pao and the Neutralists loathed one another.Ahern, pp. 318–319. T-28Ds of the Royal Lao Air Force, used in Operation Barrel Roll in the Kingdom of Laos Nevertheless, dubbed Operation Off Balance, the plan tried to live up to its name by kicking off hurriedly on 1 July 1969, three days after it was proposed. The Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 (Warrior Battalion 206) was helilifted to a landing zone at the old Operation Momentum base at San Luang. They moved out on foot northeastward toward the objective. Neutralist Bataillon Commando 208 (Commando Battalion 208), which had been regrouped at Xieng Dat after their flight from Muang Soui, marched eastward to join that column. In a separate move, the paratroop battalion, 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes (101st Parachute Battalion), was helicoptered to Ban Na, southeast of the objective, to begin their approach march. In a third part of the operation, the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 201 (Warrior Battalion 201) paired with the Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 (Battalion of Infantry 15); they were helicoptered to Phou So to walk south to Muang Soui. On 1 July, the U.S. Air Force struck the communists at Muang Soui with 50 sorties of tactical air strikes. Their bomb damage assessment was 18 secondary explosions from munitions, 12 fires set, and 39 bunkers destroyed. Weather grounded the aircraft on 2 July. On 3 July, they got through for 24 sorties. They were grounded again on 4 July. Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 refused to participate in the operation. That left the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 alone in its advance from the north. The other Neutralist unit, Bataillon Commando 208, was scarcely any more aggressive. However, the other Hmong in Bataillon Guerrier 201 and the Royalist paratroopers advanced. On 5 July, as 30 sorties each of USAF and RLAF air struck the communists, Hmong guerrillas were only five kilometers from the airfield. However, at least two PAVN battalions still blocked them. Meanwhile, pilots and road watch reconnaissance teams reported a steady flow of reinforcement from North Vietnam; they had counted eight more tanks incoming, as well as 1,000 trucks. For several days, flying weather once again turned foul; only on 8 July did air power hit, and then with only six missions. On 11 July, a Neutralist unit finally made a decisive move—Bataillon Commando 208 moved away from Muang Soui. At that, Operation Off Balance was effectively ended. That was far from the worst news on 11 July. Vang Pao's kinsman, the famed Hmong RLAF pilot Lee Lue, was killed by anti-aircraft fire. At the time of his death, he had flown over 5,000 battle missions—arguably the most combat sorties of any fighter pilot in history.Hilmer, p. 5. The communists counter-attacked on 13 July, using both tanks and heavy artillery. Lacking air support to support their resistance, the Hmong guerrillas dropped back into defensive positions. On 15 July, Vang Pao called off Operation Off Balance. Aftermath Lee Lue's funeral Lee Lue was the survivor of the first two Hmong pilots trained. His reputation as a warrior had even spread within the American fighter pilot community. Daily, weather permitting, he flew combat whether healthy or ill. He had become an important symbol to the Hmong resistance. Commonly, when he landed at the end of a day's combat, he would be so weary he would be carefully lifted from the cockpit by his ground crew.Robbins, pp. 220–225. The communists fully appreciated his significance; they celebrated with impromptu fireworks as his plane crashed. His death so stunned the Royalists that the Royal Lao Armed Forces generals actually flew to the front in Military Region 2 to pay their respects at the three-day funeral. The ceremony was an amalgam of Hmong animist and Lao Buddhist beliefs. Air Attache Colonel Robert Tyrrell laid an American Distinguished Flying Cross on Lee Lue's coffin before his interment. Raven FACs stationed at Long Tieng also joined the ceremony. Karl Polifka stated, \\"Lee Lue was one of only two people I have shed tears over in my Air Force career.\\" Another Raven, Mike Cavanaugh, considered Lee Lue his brother. Bombing of Khang Khai Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma had been greatly perturbed by the loss of Muang Soui to the communists. As planning for Off Balance went forward, he decided to remove the ban on bombing Khang Khai. He stumped for 150 air strikes to attack on 1 July as a means of showing his wrath. He also requested 150 more sorties the following day. This request to Seventh Air Force was passed back to Washington, DC for approval. It arrived there on a weekend, and was mishandled by junior staff on duty. When more senior officials returned to work on Monday, they disapproved the request as being an unnecessary escalation of the war, especially since there was a Chinese cultural mission in Khang Kai. The American ambassador in Vientiane, G. McMurtrie Godley, was also cautioned about allowing the RLAF to bomb Khang Khai, for fear of provoking the Chinese communists. The entire subject was slated for discussion at an upcoming rules of engagement on 11 August. While this was in progress, in early August, a Raven Forward Air Controller directed an air strike using a laser-guided bomb on a communist radio station on the outskirts of Khang Khai. An errant cloud misguided the bomb; it struck the Chinese cultural mission. The resulting explosion of stored munitions leveled everything within a quarter mile, including the broadcast equipment. Much to the U.S. State Department's surprise, there was no subsequent complaint from the Chinese about the bombing. On the ground After Lee Lue's funeral, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew to Long Tieng. The Royalist 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes were helilifted to a defensive position at Ban Na. On 10 August 1969, PAVN troops overran Xieng Dat, scattering the Neutralists. After the remnants of the Neutralist unit were regathered at Muong Kassy, they were airlifted to Thailand for retraining. The communists still controlled the Plain of Jars. They had escalated their offensive power with tanks; to that they added seven fresh infantry battalions.Ahern, p. 320. Vang Pao was left with an internal problem in his community. Hmong clan leaders who were demoralized by losses lobbied for withdrawal of the Hmong community westward out of the war. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

Club football  Oberer started his football with FC Basel and advanced to their first team in their 1941–42 season under Manager Eugen Rupf. After one test match, Oberer played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 26 August 1941 as Basel won 5–1 against Concordia Basel. He scored his first league goal for his club one week later on 2 November in the away game against SC Zug. It was the winning goal and Basel won 1–0. Oberer transferred out and continued his playing career with Montreux-Sports, who played one league lower. He remained with Montreux for two seasons. For Basel's 1944–45 season Oberer transferred back to his club of origin. But the season ran badly and they were relegated at the end of it. Because they had suffered relegation, the clear aim for the next season was to obtain immediate promotion. Oberer scored five goals in one league match, including three goals in a row in the 70th, 75th and 80 minute, against FC Helvetia Bern on 16 December 1945. Basel won the match 10–0. In the return game in Bern against Helvetia, Oberer scored another hat-trick as Basel won 6–1. This time he achieved three goals in a row in the 77th, 80th and 83rd minute, within six minutes of each other. With his club at the end of their 1945–46 season he gained promotion from the Nationalliga B to the Nationalliga A (now called Swiss Super League). The two youngsters in the team together scored more than half of the teams 87 goals. René Bader was the teams top goal scorer with 27 goals, Oberer was second best scorer with 20 goals. In Basel's 1946–47 season Oberer won the Swiss Cup with his club. Oberer was the team's top league goal scorer with 13 goals and he achieved two further hat-tricks during that league season. The following season in the cup match on 26 October 1947 against Balerna, Oberer scored his first hat-trick in this competition. Between the years 1941 to 1942 and again from 1944 to 1948, Oberer played a total of 151 games for Basel scoring a total of 81 goals. 93 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 17 in the Swiss Cup and 42 were friendly games. He scored 42 goals in the domestic league, 11 in the cup competition and the other 28 were scored during the test games. In the 1949–50 season he played with Cantonal Neuchâtel (later Xamax) before moving to Chiasso for two years. Again in the 1952–53 season he return to play another year for Cantonal before returning to Chiasso for three further seasons. Oberer ended his playing career after the 1956–57 season, this was his third spell with Cantonal.  National team  Oberer gained three caps for the Swiss national football team. His debut was on 18 September 1949 in the away game against Luxembourg, a 3-2 win, in which he scored a goal. His second game was in the away defeat suffered against Belgium just two weeks later. Oberers third and final national team game was on 19 March 1950 as Switzerland drew 3-3 in the away tie against Austria. In the Praterstadion in front of 62,000 spectators Oberer scored the last goal to secure the draw.

Mehra (born December 1967 in Delhi) is The William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He is the medical director of the Brigham Heart and Vascular Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and specializes in advanced heart failure, mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. He has served as president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and is the editor-in-chief of the society's journal, the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation. He was also president of the Heart Failure Society of America. Dr. Mandeep Rajinder Mehra gained international notoriety during the COVID-19 pandemic after publishing as first author two research papers in the Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine respectively, that were subsequently removed on suspicions of fabricated data. Early life and career Mandeep Rajinder Mehra was born in December 1967. After graduating in medicine from the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in 1983, he pursued further studies in the United States with the ambition to qualify in cardiac catheterization. Cardiology career Narrowing of the coronary arteries, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), after a heart transplant has been noted as a significant problem in terms of long-term survival. The terminology used in past research has varied, causing difficulties in interpreting which treatments benefit. In 2010, Mehra led the first international consensus document from the ISHLT working group on the classification of CAV, standardising the nomenclature used and therefore defining the best way to identify CAV. His paper on allograft vasculopathy was accepted for presentation at the ISHLT in Venice. His research focuses on the use of intravascular ultrasound and angioscopy in coronary artery disease after heart transplantation. In addition, he has interests in new immunosuppressive therapy in minority populations and the role of artificial hearts and bio-markers to assess diagnosis and treatment in heart failure. Other research pursuits have included reducing side-effects of endomyocardial biopsys using genomic and proteonomic markers. He was also the first to define the association of suppressed natriuretic peptide expression in obesity. In 2018, Mehra published results of his research on the benefits of some left ventricular assist devices. Surgisphere scandal On May 1, 2020, Mehra was the lead author of a small group who published results of an analysis of data from 169 hospitals collected via a database funded by Surgisphere to assess the risk of in-hospital death among patients with cardiovascular disease infected with SARS-CoV2 in the New England Journal of Medicine. On May 22, 2020, the same group published another analysis of the Surgisphere data in The Lancet describing outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without a macrolide for patients with COVID-19. The latter paper resulted in the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announcing the temporary halt of hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity Trial of therapies for COVID-19. The provenance and validity of the data and database on which both papers rely was questioned, and an expression of concern was published in The Lancet and in the NEJM. Mehra, Ruschitzka, and Patel quickly hired an independent company to conduct an audit of the Surgisphere data. BWH Press Release. 4 June 2020. https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases- detail?id=3592 On June 4th, Mehra and two of his co-authors retracted The Lancet paper that had raised caution about the safety of hydroxychloroquine, due to inability to gain access to the data in the audit. “We can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources,” Mehra and his co-authors wrote. As the NEJM study used data from Surgisphere, the authors also withdrew that study. In the meantime, the same authors pulled a pre-print publication claiming effectiveness of ivermectin, an anthelmintic, in treating coronavirus from the pre-print server, as this paper also relied on the same Surgisphere data source. However, the study had already led to Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia and Chile using the drug for COVID-19 treatment. Mehra apologised for rushing to publish during the COVID-19 crisis: \\"I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions—both directly and indirectly—I am truly sorry.\\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, called the paper a fabrication and \\"a monumental fraud\\". Dr. Eric Rubin, editor in chief of NEJM, said \\"We shouldn’t have published this\\". Mehra was introduced to Surgisphere founder Sapan Desai by colleague Amit Patel. It was later found that Desai and Patel were brothers-in-law, and that Patel's position at the University of Utah was terminated. Harvard and ethical issue with investigatorsItalic text This adds to a growing list of Harvard investigators involved in scientific misconduct. Harvard has failed to take action against investigators including the well known cardiologist Eugene Braunwald in Darsee saga in 1980s.

Arguments for Proponents of such programs have supported them with a variety of goals in mind, including: getting help for drug users on welfare payments by referring those testing positive to treatment, avoiding \\"subsidizing drug habits\\" with public money, deterring drug use, reducing state welfare spending, and protecting children. Arguments against Opponents have criticized these laws for costing more money than they save. The cost per positive test varies because of differences in state programs, but a review of 14 programs in 2016 reported costs per positive test result of between $200 (Tennessee) and $7,006 (Missouri). Eric Liu has criticized drug tests of welfare recipients, which are often promoted by Republican lawmakers, as hypocritical, as they promote government paternalism. Some suggest drug testing welfare recipients is linked to discrimination against welfare recipients or to racism. Executives of the non-profit group CLASP have stated that the laws will have a chilling effect on the willingness of existing welfare recipients to admit themselves to drug treatment. Additionally, public policy professor Harold Pollack wrote that \\"Other physical and mental health problems are far more prevalent. Yet these less-moralized concerns receive much less attention from legislators or the general public.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union has opposed welfare drug testing laws in Florida and expressed concern about the proposal gaining traction in other states. Almost all scholarly articles on the subject of suspicionless drug testing of welfare recipients has concluded that this testing violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (for this reason many programs now involve initial screening with a psychological assessment tool, with those considered likely to have a drug problem then referred for testing). The ethical acceptability of drug testing welfare recipients has also been questioned. Laws by state Arizona In 2009, Arizona enacted a drug-testing law for welfare applicants that have a felony drug conviction. Florida In December 2013, federal judge Mary Stenson Scriven struck down a Florida law, passed in May 2011, that required welfare recipients to be drug tested before they could receive benefits. Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, had endorsed the legislation, and said he intended to appeal Scriven's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Georgia In April 2014, Georgia governor Nathan Deal signed a bill requiring drug testing for welfare applicants whom state employees suspected had been using drugs. Michigan In 1999 a pilot program of drug testing welfare recipients was introduced, but terminated after a legal challenge that it violated the Fourth Amendment. In December 2014, Rick Snyder, the governor of Michigan, signed a bill beginning a pilot program whereby welfare recipients in three Michigan counties will be drug tested if they are suspected of having used drugs. Utah From August 2012 to July 2013, Utah spent over $30,000 on drug testing welfare applicants. State Representative Brad Wilson claimed in September 2013 that the program had saved more than $350,000 based on a drop of 247 applicants for TANF after the drug testing was instituted. Wisconsin Scott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin, has previously endorsed drug testing for welfare recipients. Positive drug test result rates In a pilot drug testing program in Florida in 1999-2000, 5.1% returned a positive urinalysis. A 2015 study by ThinkProgress found that out of seven states reporting data on welfare drug testing, only one had a usage rate above 1%. Analysis of data on US state programs provided by CLASP shows that of the total population screened in 9 states, 0.19% returned positive tests, or 0.57% if refused tests (where reported) are treated as positives (see data in appendix D).

As chief of staff at Campbell Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee he pioneered using penicillin. Ingram served as president of the American Orthopaedic Association (AOA) and Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA). Ingram was selected as the only orthopaedist in a group of physicians to tour active field hospitals in Vietnam at the request of the president. Ingram also served as president of various orthopaedic organizations, including the Orthopaedic Society, American Orthopaedic Association, and the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. Early life Alvin John Ingram was born on March 31, 1914, to Alvin Hill and Margaret (Gallagher) Ingram and raised in Jackson, Tennessee. His father, Alvin Hill, was a railroad conductor, who worked for the Illinois Central Railroad Hill was a direct descendant of John Buchanan, who saved the town of Nashborough (present-day Nashville) from an Indian attack. He attended Union University in Jackson, TN from 1932 to 1933 than received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in 1939, for his MD degree (1939) and Master of Science in Orthopaedic Surgery (1948) Ingram attended the University of Tennessee, Memphis. After two fellowships at Campbell, he joined the staff in 1947 as a pediatric surgeon being promoted to chief of staff from 1969 to 1976, retiring in 1983. World War II service Following the U.S. entry into World War II, Ingram joined the Army Medical Corps and was stationed at Billings General Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, from July 1 to September 1, 1942, and Bushnell General Hospital in Brigham, Utah, where he was among a select group of doctors to administer penicillin for the first time to U.S. patients. During World War II, Bushnell Hospital treated approximately 13,000 military patients with various illnesses and injuries, and in 1944, it housed 3,286 GI–patients. The U.S. Army designated Bushnell Hospital as the military's first center for the study of penicillin’s possible use. On April 1, 1943, the first shipment of penicillin arrived at Bushnell, and during the War, it administered penicillin more than any other institution in the United States. In addition to administering some of the first doses of penicillin, Ingram promoted its use to the surrounding Brigham community. In speech by then-Captain Alvin Ingram to the Rotary Club of Brigham City, he explained how penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, and extolled recent successes of administering the drug at nearby Bushnell Hospital. According to historian Richard Polenberg, “[w]artime advances in medicine, particularly in the production of penicillin (which first became generally available for civilian use in the spring of 1944) saved countless [military and civilian] lives. Colonel Robert M. Hardaway MD, commanding officer of Bushnell, participated in Ingram's wedding to Catherine Davis as her \\"father by proxy\\" since her father was unable to attend. Accomplishments and recognitions In an interview with incoming president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), James H. Beaty listed Ingram as one of his inspirational mentors, noting that \\"[w]ithin medicine, I’ve had several significant role models and mentors. Alvin J.

He is noted for persuading federal and local government to dredge Galveston's harbor, which led to Galveston becoming a prominent shipping port of the 19th century. He was survived by his son, William Lewis Moody Jr. Family life and education William Lewis Moody was born to Jameson Moody and Mary Susan (Lankford) Moody in Essex County, Virginia. He attended law school at the University of Virginia from 1847 to 1851. After passing the bar exam, he moved to Fairfield, Texas where he practiced law and operated a mercantile trading company. Eventually he started W.L. Moody & Co. with his two brothers, David Jameson Moody and Leroy F. Moody.\\"William Lewis Moody Obituary.\\" Galveston Daily News. Galveston, TX: July 18, 1920. William and Lizzie had six children. One was still born and two daughters died in infancy. His two sons were William Lewis Moody Jr. and Frank Bradley Moody. His only daughter, Mary Emily Moody, married Sealy Hutchings of Galveston. Adult life In the summer of 1861, Moody organized Company G of the Seventh Texas Infantry, and he served as captain of the company. The unit, under the command of Moody's friend John Gregg, was captured at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Moody spent six months in the federal prison camps of Camp Douglas, Camp Chase, and Johnson's Island before he was released in a prisoner exchange in September 1862. He fought in the spring 1863 campaigns in Mississippi and was commended for his bravery at the Battle of Raymond on May 12. On July 10, he was wounded while fighting near Jackson, Mississippi and was sent back to Texas to recover. He was elevated to the rank of colonel and remained in Austin for the rest of the war. In 1866, Moody moved his family to Galveston, and he began working in the cotton industry. In the 1870s and 1880s, Moody worked with other businessmen to develop railroad lines from the island to the mainland and to dredge Galveston's harbor. In 1872 he participated in the founding of the Galveston Cotton Exchange and served as the president from 1877 to 1882, 1884 to 1888, and 1898 to 1900. In 1894 W.L.

Primarily a poet- philosopher, he also earned recognition as a graphic artist. He first became known in his teenage years, when, as a friend and associate of Gherasim Luca, he put out the review Alge. Its avant-garde aesthetics and its testing of censorship resulted in their prosecution. While Luca endured as a public intellectual and a founder of the Romanian surrealist cell, Pals became a recluse. Forgotten by the general public, exposed to antisemitic and later communist persecution, he continued to write for himself and an intimate circle of friends. He had a successful career in civil and railway engineering, but political nonconformity resulted in his marginalization for part of the 1960s. Moving to Haifa in 1970, Pals was rediscovered by later generations of Romanian and Israeli readers, known to them for the moderate surrealism of his poetry and prose, and, to a lesser degree, for his take on Hegelian philosophy. His editorial debut came well into his 80s, when Pals was already bedridden and contemplating death. This led to his rediscovery as a contributor to both Romanian and Israeli literature. Biography Early life Simion \\"Senia\\" Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Sesto Pals în anul de grație 1958 (I)\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 10/2006 Shestopal, the scion of a Ukrainian Jewish family, was born in Odessa, officially on September 18, 1913, but more likely on September 5, 1912. Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Gherasim Luca și Sesto Pals, o prietenie la granițele avangardei suprarealiste\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 668, April 2013 Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Ce s-a întîmplat cu 'algiștii' în 1933?\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 1/2007 According to literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu, his familiarity with Jewish mythology and the Hebrew language can be read as a clue that he was enlisted in a cheder.Crohmălniceanu (2001), p. 171 He lived in Odessa with his parents and his brother Fima until 1920, when they were chased out of the country by the revolutionary war. Lucy Sestopali, \\"Repere biografice\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 320, May 2006 His father obtained protection status from the Italian diplomatic mission, before moving with his family to Romania and legally changing his name to Emanoil Șestopali. Paul Cernat, \\"Sesto Pals, avangardistul subteran\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 179, July–August 2003 Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Sesto Pals, dialoguri între întuneric și lumină\\", in Viața Românească, Nr. 11-12/2009 Simion's mother, Berta née Berman, later arranged for her own relatives to settle in the new country. They lived in Galați, where Simion and Fima began their schooling, until 1923, then moved to Bucharest. Simion enlisted at the Matei Basarab High School, where he was colleagues with poet Gherasim Luca. Sharing a school-desk, the two became close friends. They also associated with Aurel Baranga, who was in the same school, but slightly younger. Their circle also included female colleagues and admirers, among them Henriette Iacobsohn, future wife of the cartoonist Saul Steinberg, and Amelia Pavel, later an essayist and art historian. Pavel, who vacationed with Simion at Sovata in summer 1930, remembered him as a \\"nice and well-behaved youth\\". Amelia Pavel, \\"Prieteni din anii '30\\", in România Literară, Nr. 30/2003 Nevertheless, all three young men made a habit of deriding cultural conventions: Pals was almost expelled from school when he burst out laughing during a lecture on poet-laureate Vasile Alecsandri. In 1930, having kept up with the Western European and Romanian avant-garde, Luca founded the radical youth magazine Alge (\\"Algae\\"), with collaborations from Șestopali (the nominal \\"chief editor\\"), Baranga, and Jules Perahim; they were later joined by Paul Păun. Șestopali experimented with literary pseudonyms, sometimes signing his work for Alge as D. AmprentPop, p. 41 and then, for the first time ever, Sesto Pals. A quasi-anagram of his Romanian name-and-initial, it was sometimes corrected to Șesto Pals in later reference, but the poet always signed his work sans diacritic. Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Poezia este trăire transcendentală (II)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 599, November 2011 The family name probably originated in a Russian moniker for \\"six fingers\\" or \\"six toes\\", and Șestopali bragged that he himself had inherited an extra toe. Obscenity scandal Underfunded, Alge only put out six or seven issues in this 1930 edition. By February 1932, Pals had established his own single-issue magazine, titled Muci (\\"Snot\\") and distributed free of charge at one of Perahim's art shows. Like Păun and the other Alge men, he was also co-opted by unu, the more established avant-garde sheet, but had a tense encounter with its editor, Sașa Pană. Nonetheless, unu hosted some of Pals' prose poems, including one which mockingly advertised Perahim's art as a \\"horrid crime\\" against the state. In addition to writing poetry, he was interested in hard science, taking his baccalaureate with honors in physics. He barely passed the overall examination, after having again slammed Alecsandri's work in his Romanian literature paper. In 1933, Luca reissued Alge in a more licentious edition, and challenged the cultural establishment by sending a copy to Nicolae Iorga, the nationalist historian and political figure. A clampdown on their activities followed: all known contributors were caught in a police investigation, and Pals' home was searched for incriminating proof. Despite no longer being a contributor (and feeling alienated by Păun and Baranga's leftist militancy), Pals was implicated by his nominal editorial contribution. He was eventually arrested and sent to Văcărești prison, where his colleagues were also rounded up. Pals later recalled being subjected to a thorough interrogation by the examining magistrate, and sharing a cell with a known communist. Taking his instructions from Iorga, the coroner alleged that the Șestopalis were themselves communists, sent in from the Soviet Union to subvert Romanian society. The family was threatened with expulsion. The writers' parents eventually obtained their release, with Emanoil pleading with his son that he amend his ways. The court ruled against the Alge group, and issued two-year suspended sentences against them. This tarnished their judicial record, leaving Pals exposed to persecution. Pals was traumatized by the whole experience, and no longer bothered with his college admission, although his grades qualified him for enlistment at the Bucharest Polytechnic. In 1934, when he and his family were naturalized Romanian, Pals finally matriculated with the Polytechnic, where he majored in mining engineering and metallurgy. He kept out of literary life. When, in 1939, Luca returned from Paris a committed surrealist, Pals was invited to attend the sessions of his Bucharest surrealist circle. He did so on occasion, meeting with new recruits such as Dolfi Trost and Gellu Naum, but, as Pals biographer Michäel Finkenthal notes, \\"chain smoked [and] kept himself dead silent.\\" Pals himself later asserted: \\"I never did 'fade' out of sight, I have always been out of sight.\\" Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Poezia este trăire transcendentală (I)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 597, October 2011 Antisemitic persecution and communist oppression Pals graduated in 1940, just as the National Renaissance Front dictatorship had barred Jews from employment in most fields, including technical. Pushed out of literary life, Pals discovered philosophy, and became an avid reader of Hegel. Finkenthal notes that his \\"rather obsessive preoccupation\\" was \\"to quantify qualitative values\\", a \\"strange mixture of Hegelianism and abstract arithmetic\\". Then, at the height of World War II, the Șestopalis came to be persecuted under tighter racial laws. Pals' brother Fima escaped to Palestine.Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Gherasim Luca, teoretician al suprarealismului?\\", in Mozaicul, Nr. 11-12/2013, pp. 7-8 Pals was singled out for compulsory labor, and sent to work as a \\"Jewish engineer\\" for the State Railways. Making occasional returns to Bucharest, he had an amorous affair with Lucia \\"Lucy\\" Metsch, a Paris- trained painter of Bukovina Jewish extraction. She had narrowly escaped the Einsatzgruppen, and was working at The Barașeum. Pals sought full employment after the antifascist coup of 1944, and, in 1945, was dispatched to oversee the construction of railway tunnels in Cluj County. Later that year, he returned to Bucharest, joining the City Planning Institute as founder and president of its geotechnical engineering section. In 1946, engineer Șestopali parted with Lucy and married Valentina Berman. This created controversy: Valentina was Pals' first cousin and his junior by 15 years. She was also Holocaust survivor, having just returned from the concentration camp in Berezivka, Transnistria.Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Amintiri deghizate, Editura Nemira, Bucharest, 1994, p. 135. Although he still refrained from an open affiliation, Pals continued to visit Luca and the surrealists, introducing his wife to them. His half-sister-in-law, Mura Vlad, was a published novelist and translator from Russian. The marriage soon crumbled: Pals was an absentee husband, and Valentina found it hard to cope with the rigors of life in Communist Romania. Working as a typist, she met the poet Ion Caraion, becoming his admirer, muse, and lover. Răzvan Voncu, \\"Sesto Pals și secretele avangardei\\", in România Literară, Nr. 26/2014 Pals accepted the informal separation, resuming his love affair with Lucy Metsch, who now worked as a scenic painter for Sahia Film. He was increasingly withdrawn and troubled, dedicating himself to writing down a whole corpus of literary and philosophical works that he would not publish. During that decade, the Șestopalis came into conflict with the communist regime. In 1957, an investigation began into Caraion's samizdat poetry, which was highly critical of the regime, and which Valentina had helped circulate. At the risk of incriminating himself, Pals returned to his conjugal home and protected his estranged wife. In mid 1958, Valentina was arrested by the Securitate, then implicated in Caraion's trial for sedition. She dismissed the option to denounce Caraion in exchange for freedom, and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.Sipoș, p. 6 Daniel Cristea-Enache, \\"Ion cel Negru\\", in România Literară, Nr. 2/2007 In 1962, Pals applied for an exit visa and emigration to Israel, a rebellious gesture which saw his demotion with reduced pay and his relocation to the remote town of Dej. Valentina, released from prison under a general amnesty, divorced him in 1963, and later married Caraion. Pals also married Lucy in 1965, and, starting 1967, retook his position at the Bucharest Planning Institute. He earned respect in the engineers' community, and had several professional awards to his name, while privately working on a set of essays which sought to reconcile Hegelianism with existentialism and phenomenology. Emigration By his own account, Pals lived a quiet and exceptionally fulfilling life down to 1970: caught up in his work during daytime, he turned to writing literature at night, and reconnected with his avant-garde friends. He still refrained from going public, although two of his close friends, former avant-garde writers Baranga and Geo Bogza, were well regarded by the regime and could arrange him a publishing deal. He was more preoccupied with discovering (as he put it) \\"the mystery of existence through one's own existence\\". That interval came to an end in 1970, when he and his wife were allowed to emigrate. They were seen to their plane by Bogza, the dissenting communist. Pals was forced by the authorities to leave his voluminous manuscripts behind in Romania; he split them into fascicles, which he hid in various places. Ion and Valentina Caraion, together with their daughter Marta, were themselves allowed to leave in 1981, moving to Lausanne. Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Intersecție europeană\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 345, November 2006 Caraion, who had agreed to collaborate with the Securitate in return for his freedom, was repeatedly blackmailed by his former supervisors.Sipoș, pp. 6, 7 Pals resumed his professional career in Haifa, where he oversaw the digging of utility tunnels. He traveled outside the country to meet Luca, who was living in Paris. However, his health declined abruptly, and he was forced to take retirement in 1982. He suffered from gastrointestinal cancer, and was treated at the Rabin Medical Center.A Generous Step Toward Prevention, Rabin Medical Center Spokesman Department, November 25, 2007; retrieved December 29, 2014 Working from his home, a small apartment in Bnei Brak, Pals focused entirely on philosophical essays, which he composed in French, Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Note de drum\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 351, December 2006 and a new set of visual poetry pieces. He reluctantly agreed to have samples of these works published in Romanian diaspora magazines—including Caraion's Don Quijote and Alexandru Lungu's Argo. In 1985, the Honolulu exile Ștefan Baciu dedicated him a special issue of his MELE, a poetry newsletter. It included homage pieces by his old friends Păun and Bogza.Crohmălniceanu (2001), pp. 172, 200 Interviewed about his work by journalist Solo Har-Herescu in 1993, Pals was oblique: \\"I am not fit to answer, as my head is filled with those snake-like questions, poisoning my replies, eating them up as they [...] bite into their own tails, making it hard to know where tails begin and heads end.\\" His only reason for writing was \\"an inner urging\\", as \\"so much better poems\\" already existed, which were still \\"of no use to the reading public\\". Final years and death Sesto Pals the poet was rediscovered in Romania only after the 1989 Revolution: in 1998, Nicolae Tzone published a book of his poetry with Editura Vinea, as Omul ciudat (\\"The Bizarre Man\\"). It was only at this time that Pals' former colleagues in the Bucharest Planning Institute discovered that he was the same as the avant-garde poet, as one of them confessed in a letter to the editors. Omul ciudat had a small circulation and, according to critic Răzvan Voncu, was only popular among the \\"connoisseurs of the avant-garde\\". The book earned Pals the Benjamin Fondane Award, granted by the Association of Romanian Writers in Israel. Pals' health condition was declining to such a degree that he had to be carried to that ceremony; by 1999, he was bedridden and tube-fed, but fully conscious and perfecting poems that were supposed to convey his final message to the world. He was still working on this on October 17, 2002, when he had to be taken to hospital. Pals died in Tel Aviv, on October 27, 2002. Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Epistolă despre trup\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 5-6/2006 Just days before this happened, the Romanian review Tribuna hosted three of his final poems. Pals' last work saw print a month later, in Ultima Oră, the Tel Aviv Romanian- Jewish newspaper. A revised edition of Omul ciudat came out at Editura Paideia, with illustrations by Mariana Macri, daughter of Pals' friend Ionathan X. Uranus. Much of Pals' sizable fortune was bequeathed to the Rabin Medical Center, founding a research unit \\"for early detection and prevention of gastrointestinal cancer\\". Pals was survived by Lucy, who died in 2006, and by Valentina Caraion, both of whom participated in the effort to recover and edit his work. Although most of Pals' texts remained unpublished and under- researched, a follow-up to Omul ciudat, titled Întuneric și lumină (\\"Darkness and Light\\") was put out in Romania in 2007. His 2013 centennial was celebrated in Romania under the auspices of the Museum of Romanian Literature and Gaudeamus Book Fair. \\"Târgul Internațional Gaudeamus. Programul zilei de sâmbătă, 23 noiembrie (I)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, November 15, 2013 Interest in Pals' work and personality was kept alive by the philosopher-physicist Michäel Finkenthal, who also collected some of the lesser known prose works into a 2014 anthology. A fictionalized portrayal of Pals as \\"the bizarre poet\\" is found in Virgil Duda's 2011 novel, Un cetățean al lumii (\\"A Citizen of the World\\"). Paul Cernat, \\"Legături fără frontiere\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1139, January 2012 Work Various exegetes have reached the conclusion that Pals' Alge poetry is ahead of its time and context, one of the more notable contribution to the second-wave avant-garde in Romania. Paul Cernat describes a clash of visions between the \\"prophetic\\" ambitions of Alge and Pals' character, that of a \\"vulnerable introvert, terrorized by the precariousness of the human condition\\". According to Ion Pop, some of these poems stand out among the \\"purely awkward exercises\\" of youth, as \\"unhinged\\" expressionist pieces in succession to those of Adrian Maniu and Jules Laforgue.Pop, pp. 41, 43 Other, tamer, pieces were directly inspired by the hermetic Ion Barbu and the mainstream modernist Tudor Arghezi. Several poems are singled out by Crohmălnicanu for being biblical-themed and distinctly apocalyptic, while yet others are \\"socially-inspired\\", \\"unanimistic\\" and \\"fraternal\\", addressed to \\"those people I meet on the tram\\".Crohmălniceanu (2001), pp. 171-172 By the mid 1950s, when he settled for a format of blank verse and haikus, Pals was prone to philosophical meditation, and explored much deeper into lyrical themes. As argued by Finkenthal, this change was prompted by his separation from Valentina: \\"From now on, the poet finds himself locked in a world where things happen, things change, where there is no longer room for any refuge into love or wisdom.\\" Michäel Finkenthal, \\"Sesto Pals în anul de grație 1958 (II)\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 12/2006 According to Voncu, there was another cultural layer: like Gellu Naum and other late arrivals on the avant-garde scene, Pals was moving away from the sheer negativity of Alge, and attempting to construct instead a post-philosophical surrealism. Cernat sees Pals' surrealism as having \\"a familiar face\\", with classical-format quatrains like those of Tristan Tzara, H. Bonciu, and Jacques Prévert. Some of Pals' poems, tentatively dated to 1958, seemingly allude to Valentina's arrest by the communists and the whole wave of political repression. Such dark and brooding works are held by both Finkenthal and Voncu as proof that Caraion and Pals influenced each other directly, despite their erotic rivalry. One fragment depicts silent struggles between the scheming fishermen and their catch, implying that fish still have a dying hope: In 1960s prose poems which display influences from Franz Kafka or Urmuz, Pals amplified his sense of bafflement about the human condition. Nonetheless, Finkenthal writes, his very series of lyrical verse hints at \\"truths that are inaccessible to common mortals\\". He reconciled himself with the idea of time by denying its concreteness, but drew a line between general time and \\"the time of creation\\". The latter allowed for a future, and therefore provided room for \\"affirmation and oblivion\\". This meant that, \\"once he puts himself on the line, an artist will have to fade into his own affirmation.\\" The moribund Pals sketched out a quaint prophecy: References References *Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Evreii în mișcarea de avangardă românească, Editura Hasefer, Bucharest, 2001. *Ion Pop, \\"Un 'om ciudat': Sesto Pals\\", in Steaua, Nr. 7-8/2009, pp. 41–43 *Mariana Sipoș, \\" 'Rămâne-o lacrimă năucă' — de vorbă cu Valentina Caraion\\", in Jurnalul Literar, Nr. 7-10/1999, pp. 6–7 External links *Pals, Sesto, in The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe *The Bucharest Surrealist Group (collective portrait), in Europeana database Category:1910s births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century Romanian poets Category:21st- century Romanian poets Category:20th-century Israeli poets Category:21st- century Israeli poets Category:Romanian male poets Category:Israeli male poets Category:Jewish Romanian writers Category:Jewish Ukrainian poets Category:Expressionist poets Category:Romanian surrealist writers Category:20th-century essayists Category:Romanian essayists Category:Romanian philosophers Category:Romanian science writers Category:Philosophers of science Category:Hegelian philosophers Category:Jewish existentialists Category:Romanian writers in French Category:Romanian magazine editors Category:Romanian magazine founders Category:Romanian illustrators Category:Israeli illustrators Category:Writers who illustrated their own writing Category:Politehnica University of Bucharest alumni Category:Romanian mining engineers Category:Geotechnical engineers Category:Train drivers Category:Odessa Jews Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Romania Category:Jewish refugees Category:Soviet emigrants to Romania Category:Naturalised citizens of Romania Category:Obscenity controversies in literature Category:Romanian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Romania Category:Căile Ferate Române people Category:Censorship in Romania Category:Romanian people of World War II Category:Romanian emigrants to Israel Category:Deaths from cancer in Israel Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:20th-century philosophers ","title":"Sesto Pals"},{"id":"44871193","text":"The 1935–36 William & Mary Indians men's basketball team represented the College of William & Mary in intercollegiate basketball during the 1935–36 season.

He previously played for the New York Giants. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, leading the Pac-12 Conference in rushing as a sophomore in 2014. He earned second-team All-Pac-12 honors the following year. High school career Perkins attended Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona, where he played high school football with his childhood friend and future college teammate Brett Hundley. As a senior, Perkins was named first-team all-state after rushing for 1,297 yards and 20 touchdowns. He was also the most valuable player (MVP) of the track team, which won the state title. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was rated as the 40th-best athlete prospect of his class. On December 4, 2011, he committed to UCLA over offers from Fresno State and Northwestern. College career Perkins redshirted as a true freshman in 2012. In 2013, he became the Bruins' primary rusher after starter Jordon James sprained his ankle. Perkins started four games, and rushed for 573 yards on 134 carries (4.3 avg) and six touchdowns. He also caught 24 passes for 296 yards. In 2014, he worked his way into a pivotal role in the offense. As a backup to James in the season opener, Perkins ran for 80 yards against Virginia. He later became the team's starter. With starting quarterback Hundley exiting in the first quarter after an injury, Perkins gained 195 all-purpose yards in a 20–17 win over Texas. In the Alamo Bowl, he was named the game's offensive MVP after running for a then- career-high 194 yards and scoring two touchdowns in a 40–35 win over Kansas State. He finished the season as the Pac-12 leader with 1,575 yards rushing, the second-highest in UCLA history behind Johnathan Franklin (1,734 in 2012). In 2015, Perkins ran for a career-high 219 yards against BYU. He finished his junior year with 1,343 yards and 14 touchdowns, and was named second-team All- Pac-12. After the season, he decided to forgo his senior season and declared for the 2016 NFL Draft.

He was rated as the seventh-best running back by NFLDraftScout.com. Perkins was invited to the NFL Combine but was unable to finish all the drills after suffering an injury to his hamstring while running his 40-yard dash. Scouts and analysts gave mostly positive reviews focused on his one-cut ability, quality vision, reliable hands, decisive gap selection, and willingness to pick up blitzes. He was also criticized for his lack of consistent play speed, limited route options, and smallish frame. New York Giants Perkins was selected by the New York Giants in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft with the 149th overall pick. He signed a four-year, $2.59 million contract that included a signing bonus of $252,548. Perkins entered the 2016 season as the Giants' fourth running back on the depth chart, behind veterans Rashad Jennings, Bobby Rainey, and Orleans Darkwa. Late in the year, Perkins was being used as the primary back, in front of Jennings. In the regular season finale against the Washington Redskins, he had 21 carries for 102 rushing yards. The Giants lost in the wild card round of the playoffs to the Green Bay Packers. On May 2017, Giants head coach Ben McAdoo named Perkins the starting running back. Perkins played in 11 games in 2017 season and finished with 41 carries for 90 rushing yards and eight receptions for 46 yards. On May 10, 2018, he was waived by the Giants with a non-football injury designation after suffering a pectoral injury in the offseason, and then placed on their reserve/non-football injury list. On September 16, 2019, Perkins was waived by the Giants. Detroit Lions On September 17, 2019, Perkins was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions.

It is approximately long and flows in a north to northwesterly direction toward the community of Patagonia, where it joins with Sonoita Creek. Most of Harshaw Creek is ephemeral and experiences its greatest stream- flow after the summer monsoon and winter snowstorms. Vegetation is typical to the region with cottonwood, willow, sycamore and other lesser plants forming a riparian corridor along its banks. Upper Harshaw Creek flows through a narrow, steep-walled valley, which widens out into a sandy channel as it enters the Sonoita Valley a few miles south of Patagonia. Much of Harshaw Creek is located within the Coronado National Forest and is available for recreational use. Several ranches are also located alongside the creek, although cattle grazing is limited. The creek and its tributaries were the center of extensive gold and silver mining activity beginning at the end of the 19th century and lasting well into the 20th century. As a result, there are multiple abandoned mines in the area, which are a significant source of pollution. Because of this, Harshaw Creek has a significantly higher pH level than other nearby streams.

The first professional team was the Bridgeport Giants who played in the Eastern League from 1885 through 1887. Bridgeport moved to the Connecticut State League in 1888 and became the Bridgeport Victors for the 1895 and 1896 seasons. They were nicknamed the Orators in 1898 to coincide with the nickname of the team's owner and manager, Baseball hall of famer Jim \\"The Orator\\" O'Rourke. In 1904, the team won a league record 71 games and went on to win the championship. Their home games were played at Newfield Park which was located on Newfield Ave. In 1913 they moved to the Eastern Association as the Bridgeport Crossmen and they moved again, to a new version of the Eastern League in 1916, where they would remain until the league folded in 1932. This version of the team was known as the Americans until 1923 and then the Bears. In 1941 they resurfaced as the Bees in the Interstate League but were shut down again by the onset of World War II. The team returned in 1947 in the Colonial League where they remained until they folded in 1950. No team played in Bridgeport until the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball started in 1998.

During his time in the Ottoman Empire, Smith was a caretaker of many Armenians who were victims of the Armenian Genocide. He wrote extensively about the treatment of his patients and provided detailed medical assessments of each of them. Smith later worked in the Philippines for nine years, and remained in there for another thirty years. During World War II, he was captured by Japanese forces and was held as a prisoner of war. He returned to the United States where he spent the rest of his life. Early life Floyd Smith was born on December 1, 1885 in Rowley, Iowa to parents Arthur and Jane Smith. After attaining a Bachelor of Science degree from Lenox College in 1907, Smith continued his studies at the University of Iowa where he attained his medical degree in 1911. He served as an intern at the Iowa Methodist Hospital in Des Moines. He married Bessie Heath in Hopkinton, Iowa on 4 October 1912. Floyd Olin Smith prior to leaving to the Ottoman Empire Work in the Ottoman Empire Floyd Smith was sent to the Ottoman Empire by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). He sailed from Boston on 31 December 1912 and initially settled in Paris, France where he remained there for six months in order to learn French. Smith then arrived in the Ottoman Empire in 1913 where he passed medical examinations in Constantinople. After he was briefly sent to Jerusalem he was then transferred to Aintab (today Gaziantep) located in the eastern provinces of the Empire. While in Aintab, Floyd and Bessie Smith had a child named Arthur. However, both Floyd and Bessie became gravely ill. After making a recovery, Floyd Smith moved to Kharpert (today Harput) where he united with other missionaries. By this time, his correspondence with relatives in the United States suggested that war was about to begin. In one letter, Smith noted that the conscription of Armenians into the military caused much anxiety within the Armenian community while the Turks, on the other hand, were similarly dissatisfied with the policy. Smith was later transferred to Diyarbakir in October 1914. During his time there he was unable to continue corresponding. With the outbreak of World War I, the local British consulate in Diyarbakir entrusted Smith with the archives of the consulate. The archives were to be transferred to the American consulate for security purposes. However, Smith, along with a nurse, decided to burn the archives. Treating victims of the Armenian Genocide When a typhus outbreak occurred in Diyarbakir, Smith was assigned to treat the provincial governor, Hamdi Bey. By this time, Hamdi Bey had a tolerant view towards the local Armenian population. However, fearing that he might lose his post as governor due to his tolerance, he ordered the arrest of many Armenians he believed would cause disturbances. Nevertheless, Hamdi Bey was still branded as someone who favored the Armenians and was subsequently removed from his post and replaced by Mehmed Reshid Bey in March 1915. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and fighting erupted at the border against Russia. In early spring of 1915, the Russians advanced successfully into Ottoman territory and the quick march of their army toward Diyarbakir, according to Turkish historian Uğur Ümit Üngör, must have confirmed Reshid's \\"apocalyptic fear\\" of the Russians and perceptions that all Armenians were Russian spies. Floyd Smith managed to establish contact with the new governor in the first few weeks of his governorship. However, the governor then prohibited Smith from visiting him. Dr. Smith asserted, \\"Diyarbakir is an interior province with extremely few foreigners—an ideal setup to find out how to solve the Troublesome Armenian problem: Massacre and Deportation, or both combined. Talaat, Enver, and Jemal were fiends from hell itself.\\" By this time, the deportations of the Armenians in Diyarbakir had already begun and there were mass arrests of Armenian men throughout the city. Smith described that during the arrests, many belongings were confiscated and sexual assaults towards women were rampant. Smith also remarked how the Armenian male population was disarmed and subjugated to torture: Mehmed Reshid would eventually be known for organizing the annihilation of the Armenian communities of Diyarbekir, earning him the nickname the \\"butcher of Diyarbakir\\". He had persuaded himself that the native Armenian population was conspiring against the Ottoman state and he had accordingly drawn up plans for the \\"solution of the Armenian question.\\" In his memoirs, Reshid recounted his first days as governor: Over the next two months, the Armenians of the province were targeted in an extermination campaign through wholesale massacres and deportations. According to the Venezuelan officer and mercenary Rafael de Nogales, who visited the region in June 1915, Reshid had recently received a three-worded telegram from Talat Pasha to \\"Burn-Destroy-Kill,\\" an order cited as official government approval of his persecution of the Christian population. Nesimi Bey and Sabit Bey, the governors of the districts of Lice and Sabit, respectively, are both suspected to have been assassinated under the express orders of Reshid for their opposition to the killings. Anywhere between 144,000 and 157,000 Armenians, Assyrians, and other Christians, or 87 to 95% of the province's Christian population, were killed or deported during Reshid's tenure as governor of Diyarbekir. upright During these events, Smith received many patients from throughout the province of Diyarbakir who suffered from deportations, torture, and massacre. He compiled a list of all the patients he treated and provided details concerning each patient. In one such instance, on 21 May 1915, Smith received a group of twenty patients who escaped the massacres of Karabash, a village near Diyarbakir. The village had a population of about seven hundred people, and consisted of a mixed population of Armenians and Assyrians. Despite the fact that Turkish soldiers were guarding the village to prevent escapes, about twenty people managed to flee to Diyarbakir for safety and treatment. Smith reported that these patients suffered from bullet wounds, severed wrists, attempted decapitations, and sword and knife cuts. Smith recounted that one of the more common torture techniques was the bastinado, which involves the beating the soles of a person's bare feet. One such patient, considered a \\"prominent Armenian\\", underwent seven hundred lashes to the soles of his feet. The man received heavy swelling around his feet and his skin, which had already contained numerous blisters, was visibly broken. Smith also treated an Armenian woman who was beaten in prison and had several bruises on her legs and arms. In late May 1915, Smith had sent a telegraph to Henry H. Riggs, a Christian missionary stationed in Kharpert. The telegraph requested help from him, since Smith and his wife were the only missionaries left in Diyarbakir. Riggs, who overheard of the massacres in Diyarbakir, immediately went to Diyarbakir and was greeted by Smith. Riggs noted that he was particularly relieved when he saw that Dr. Smith wasn't in immediate danger, since most of the massacres happened outside of Diyarbakir. Riggs visited Smith's treatment center, which in reality was his own home. In his report to the ABCFM, Smith remarked that Henry H. Riggs was also a witness to the condition of his patients. In his memoirs, Riggs does relate his encounters with Smith's patients. Riggs also noted that Smith refused to leave his post as a doctor since his patients needed him. It was then decided that Dr. Smith's wife and their child Arthur should return with Riggs to Kharpert while Smith remained in Diyarbakir. Emergency passport photograph dated 16 August 1915 of the Smith family following their expulsion from Ottoman Empire Bessie Smith and Arthur left with Riggs to Kharpert on 3 June and arrived two days later. On their way there, Bessie Smith's bag was searched by Turkish authorities and a code that was to be used in communication with her husband was confiscated. This involved use of innocent terms to describe such things as \\"massacre\\", \\"tortures\\" and \\"imprisonments\\". Rumors had circulated claiming that the Armenians were planning to conduct an insurrection against the local government and that Floyd Smith was one of their agents. Smith believed that an Armenian close to him was forced to make such a claim in order to escape torture. Dr. Floyd Smith was subsequently expelled from Diyarbakir as a result of an official order from the governor. After his expulsion, the government confiscated the property of the ABCFM. Smith was then transferred to Urfa where he was imprisoned; his release was arranged by Jesse B. Jackson, the United States consul of Aleppo. He only able to meet with his wife and children outside of the country. After a special passport was granted to them in August 1915, Floyd Smith along with his family settled in Beirut before being transferred to Greece. Work in the Philippines Floyd Smith volunteered to work for the Red Cross and briefly cared for Russian and Turkish soldiers in 1916. He was then sent to the Philippines in 1918 where he settled in Cagayan de Oro. In 1922, Smith founded a hospital there that contained fifty beds. In late 1924, Bessie Smith died while giving birth to their fifth child. He remarried in 1925, to fellow American missionary Anna Isabel Fox (1890-1974). He officially served with the Red Cross until 1927, but continued to run his own private medical practice. He then worked for the Insular lumber Company as an industrial doctor and worked around the country. World War II Dr. Floyd Smith treated many male internees who, from malnourishment, lost an average of 53 pounds during the 37 months of their internment at Santo Tomas. During the Philippines Campaign (1941–42), when Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, Smith fled to Negros island where he and his Filipino friends were captured and taken in as a prisoner of war. For three years, Smith was then interned in various internment camps until he was ultimately relocated to Santo Tomas Internment Camp. The camp housed more than 4,000 internees from January 1942 until February 1945. At Santo Tomas, he continued to treat various prisoners and saved the lives of dozens of internees, many of which were starved. In January 1945, a doctor reported that the average loss of weight among male internees had been during the three years at Santo Tomas, 32.5 percent of average body weight (Forty percent loss of normal body weight will usually result in death).Cogan, Frances B. Captured: The Japanese Internment of American Civilians in the Philippines, 1941–1945. Athens, GA: U of GA Press, 2000 p. 206 A month later, however, American forces liberated the camp in February 1945, but it was not until September that Santo Tomas finally closed and the last internees boarded a ship for the US or sought out places to live in Manila, almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Manila.Hartendorp, A.V.H. The Japanese Occupation of the Philippines. Manila: Bookmark, 1967, pp. 613–626 Later life After World War II, Smith briefly continued his medical practices in the Philippines. Eventually however, he settled in the United States in the late 1950s. He died in Felton, California on August 6, 1961 at the age of seventy- five and is buried at the Felton cemetery.

The historic property in downtown Houston faces Market Square and lies within the Main Street Market Square Historic District. It is probably the \\"oldest Houston building existing on its original site.\\" History The Kennedy Bakery is named for John Kennedy, a baker born in Ireland. He resided in New Jersey and Missouri before immigrating to the Republic of Texas in 1842. He arrived in Houston with no savings, but opened his first bakery in the fall on Franklin Street. He accumulated and developed property at the corner of Congress and Travis streets, though he lost these buildings to a fire in August 1860. He did not hesitate in rebuilding; however, it is only conjecture that the Kennedy Bakery is this 1860 building. Kennedy was already successful leading up to the American Civil War, converting his bakery to steam power, operating as a grocer, and establishing his own grist mill. He had already amassed thousands of acres of land within the Houston region in addition to his urban properties. He owned many slaves and offered material support to the Confederate States of America (CSA). He sold hard tack to the CSA Army and converted one of his buildings into an arsenal. After the war he divested of his rural land at great financial loss. By 1873, Kennedy’s building operated as a drug store, and various druggists were tenants through 1932. It continued to operate as a retail location after 1932. In 1960, there were renovations to the structure and grillwork was added. Ownership remained within the Kennedy family until 1970, when it was sold to William V. Berry, who opened La Carafe. La Carafe was one of the oldest bars operating in Houston as of 2012. Building description In 1979, the NHRP nomination form described the Kennedy Bakery as a two-story brick building with a first floor window of wooden sash broken into 24 light. The lot to its east was bordered by a five- foot alley, while abutting a retail building to the west. The façade had fifteen feet of frontage and its brick was a structural feature. Pilasters flanked the front entry, a single door under a \\"bracket-supported architrave.\\" The upper windows were double-sashed with nine lights each. The alley led to an interior courtyard.

Built in 1932, the three-span reinforced concrete girder bridge connects the Second and Fifth Ward areas, northeast of downtown Houston. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 2002. Description The 290-foot continuous girder bridge is divided into two 85 foot spans and a center 120 foot span. The center span crosses the entire central channel of the Buffalo Bayou. The bridge provides 42 feet of vertical clearance. As it is located between two bends in the bayou and crosses it at an angle, the design also allows for 100 feet of horizontal clearance to accommodate the small craft traveling the bayou at the time it was built. The road surface atop the concrete deck is two and one-half inch brick on a one-inch sand cushion. The concrete girders are curved in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and reveals the distribution of the bridge's load on the girders. The bridge was painted aquamarine, purple and lavender by a local artist in 1985. A partial version for HTTP access is also available. History The Buffalo Bayou was an import trade route between Houston and Galveston Bay as early as 1836. Steamboat service was established in 1837. The area around the future Mckee Street had become a major industrial and commercial center by the start of the 1900s. The new automobile as well as continued growth in train and bayou transportation required more, and better, bridges. The first bridge built at McKee street was a steel truss swing bridge, using a motor to move the bridge out of the way of water traffic. The 1932 bridge was built to replace the 1908 bridge that had been demolished in 1928. A requirement by the War Department for both a minimum vertical and horizontal clearance, coupled with McKee Street meeting the bayou at a 77 degree angle required a new bridge that was unique for its time. The concrete girders, usually designed as any other type of wood or steel beam, were instead shaped to match the calculated bending moment curve, resulting in reduced cost and a longer span. Indeed, the central span was the longest of any concrete girder bridge at the time, and the undulating wave-like shape had also never been used before. The bridge was built between 1931 and 1932 for a contracted price, including removal of the previous bridge, of $122,000.

Early life and military career Longshaw left school at 14 to work for his father, a delivery van driver who operated in Peckham. During the Second World War, on his 17th birthday in 1943, Ted enlisted with the Royal Navy where he first undertook his basic naval training at HMS Royal Arthur, Skegness; then was based at HMS Scotia, Doonfoot specialising as a signalman. By 1944, as Signalman 1st Class, he joined HMS Wager, a newly built W class destroyer, serving there for 21 months and graduating to Leading Signalman by 1945. Following training on board Wager, Longshaw served at the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, supporting Fleet Air Arm's participation of Operation Meridian and subsequently escorted HMS King George V in Guam. During the final stage of the war, Longshaw was temporarily transferred to its sister ship HMS Whelp, serving with the future Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh who were both present during the Japanese surrender and returned to Portsmouth in January 1946. Later life and radio-controlled car racing After being demobilisation in the late 1940s, Longshaw undertook a career in laundry engineering, setting up his own successful company. Longshaw also became involved in the model car industry with his son. He took part in the first radio-controlled car meet in England for l:8th scale cars on Easter Monday of 1971, which led him to form the British Radio Car Association that year. That led him to fly overseas to the United States to take part in the ROAR Open National Championship at the Briggs Cunningham Museum, California. He returned to the same championship in 1974 and 1975 and attempted to persuade American drivers to compete in Europe without success. As president of EFRA, he persuaded European drivers to compete in California in 1977. In response to his request, racer John Thorpe agreed to allow ROAR to host races on his circuit, and Longshaw organised the race. Beside the twenty plus European drivers taking part, the rest of the field consisted of expatriates. It was then agreed afterward that the next world championship was to be held in Europe in 1979 but Monaco wanted to hold a round in 1978 but took a compromise with the EFRA and agreed to hold a World Cup race there that year. Following a world championship round in Geneva, as a number of clubs and organizations had previously advertised their meeting as a world championship round with their own rules, Longshaw called a meeting of thirty people involved in the industry with the intention to create a world governing body that would not only establish a uniform set of rules, it would establish the prestige of a single World Championship round every two years. Longshaw retired from his position as president in EFRA in 1983 and IFMAR in 1995, remaining at the latter as an honorary president where he remained active in the sport and attending meetings. Longshaw also ran his eponymous model shop, Ted Longshaw Model Cars serving as a UK agent for Novarossi, Associated Electrics and Mugen Seiki, closing the business down to focus on his other interests. Longshaw also served as the Master of the Worshipful Company of Launderers between 1989 and 1990 and was in 2010, a captain of his golf club near Downe, Kent, his hometown where he lived with his wife, Linda, held a position of Company Secretary up to his passing at his home on 6 September 2011 at 85 having suffering from respiratory problems for a long period of time. Longshaw was given a private cremation service on 21 September followed by a memorial service.http://news.efra.ws/fileadmin/news/2011/09/Ted%20Announcement.pdf References Category:1926 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Royal Navy personnel of World War II Category:Royal Navy sailors Category:Radio- controlled car personalities ","title":"Ted Longshaw"},{"id":"44872097","text":"TECS, formerly known as the Treasury Enforcement Communications System, is used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to manage the flow of people through border ports of entry and for immigration enforcement case management.

The road provides a primary access route across the Brinsmead Gap for suburbs west of the Whitfield Range, and is one of two major crossings over the Barron River. In 2007, it was estimated that 24,000 vehicles per day used the road. After proceeding north-west for 2.4 km from the Bruce Highway at Bungalow, the dual carriageway road alignment follows Reservoir Road west of a signalised intersection with Pease Street in the suburb of Manoora. A number of suburban streets connect directly to the arterial between here and Enmore Road. West of Enmore Road, the route rises over high terrain. A grade separated interchange provides access to McManus Street, Whitfield through this section. Beyond this point, access from some side streets is possible as the alignment passes Kanimbla and Brinsmead. Turning north from Brinsmead to follow the Redlynch Valley, the road becomes a single carriageway passing over the Kuranda Scenic Railway and through Kamerunga where it crosses the Barron River. North of the river, the arterial provides access to Caravonica before joining the Captain Cook Highway at a large roundabout adjacent to the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway terminal. Plans exist to duplicate the road between Brinsmead and Caravonica, which would include the construction of two bridges and an overpass. Based on current capacity this upgrade is estimated to be complete by 2023, however a proposed 7,500 room resort and casino at Yorkeys Knob may require the upgrade to occur earlier due to increased traffic volumes associated with the development.

In 1965 it again became possible to make a Catalan version of a film; Armando Moreno's Maria Rosa was made in Castilian and dubbed into Catalan; Moreno's wife, Nuria Espert played the title role. The film was of poor quality. \\"La horda\\" (1969) The Institut de Cinema Català was founded in 1975 by a group of over 70 professionals from all areas of the cinema. It was divided into four sections: commissions for education, labour and production, distribution and exhibition, and the economic commission. The first films made were two documentaries by Francesc Bellmunt (Canet rock and La nova cançò) and La ciutat cremada by Antoni Riba. In the mid 1970s there also existed in Catalonia some groups of \\"alternative\\" film-makers, e.g. the Central del Corto.Molina-Foix, V. (1977) New Cinema in Spain.

Early life and education He was born in Portland, Oregon in 1946 and completed a Commercial Arts course at Mt. San Antonio Jr College in California between 1964 and 1965. Between 1971 and 1973, he studied Commercial Arts and Pottery at Long Beach Jr College. Career and process He first visited New Zealand in 1973 and emigrated in 1975, establishing a studio in Nelson. For ten years he worked with a woodfired kiln, before experimenting with gas, diesel and electric kilns. He works largely with earthenware pottery. In an interview with Form Gallery in Christchurch, Fullmer discussed his working processes, saying, \\"Some years ago I started exploring with new forms at the lower firing temperatures. Now what I try to show more than anything else is the feeling of clay. By stretching, tearing, pulling and pushing, the plastic qualities of the material become apparent. The firing procedure is very important as it gives life to this fragile material. I try to use fire in such a way that the passage of the flames show on the body of the work. Although I have a tremendous respect for traditions of ceramics, I do not wish to be a slave to them. I want my work to represent my time, my thoughts, and my people.\\" Recognition In 1985, Fullmer won a Merit Award at the Fletcher Brownbuilt Pottery Awards, going on to win the Supreme Award the following year. In 1987, he was the joint winner of the Supreme Award at the Fletcher Brownbuilt Pottery Awards. In 1992, his work was included in Treasures of the Underworld at the Seville World Expo. His work is held in the collections of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Rodgers remained loyal to the Union during the war, and chaired the convention that reorganized the state government in January 1865. Prior to the war, Rodgers served as U.S. Attorney for Tennessee's Eastern District (1850-1853), and taught at East Tennessee College (the forerunner of the University of Tennessee).

During the Black Hawk War (1832), Rodgers served as a commissary colonel, and thus the title \\"Colonel\\" would subsequently be associated with his name. In 1834, Rodgers organized a petition calling for the gradual abolition of slavery, which he submitted to the state constitutional convention then in session.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (R. Clarke and Company, 1899), p. 111. In 1849, President Zachary Taylor appointed Rodgers United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee. He served in this position until 1853.

He left the senate at the end of his term in 1857. During the 1860 presidential election, Rodgers supported the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell, who sought to preserve the union by opposing both secession and abolition. In September 1860, Rodgers was one of five Bell supporters who confronted radical Alabama secessionist William Yancey during one of Yancey's campaign events in Knoxville. Rodgers was one of the more vocal Unionists at a citywide assembly held in Knoxville in late 1860 to discuss the secession issue.Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War, pp. 150-165. In May 1861, Rodgers was among the Unionists who signed a call for the region's Union supporters to meet in Knoxville at what would become known as the East Tennessee Convention. He attended this convention as a member of the Knox County delegation.Proceedings of the East Tennessee Convention (H. Barry Book Company, 1861). Accessed at the Calvin M.

In the March 1865 elections scheduled by the convention, Rodgers was elected to the Tennessee Senate seat for the new fifth district, which consisted of Knox and Roane counties (his previous constituency). When the state senate convened on April 5, Rodgers was elevated to speaker. In his acceptance speech, he stated the new senate's immediate purpose was to \\"restore this once proud, prosperous and happy state to its original place among the loyal States of the Union.\\"\\"Editor's Correspondance,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 12 April 1865, p. 2.

One of the senate's first actions was to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which outlawed slavery.\\"Tennessee Legislature,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 6 April 1865, p. 1. In May 1865, the state senate turned to a contentious piece of legislation known as the \\"Franchise Bill,\\" which would bar former Confederates from voting. While the more radical members of the legislature, including Rodgers, vigorously supported the bill, some of the more moderate legislators (including Rodgers' House counterpart William Heiskell) opposed it. Speaking forcefully in favor of the bill, Rodgers stated that Rebels \\"had no right to live, much less to vote,\\" and that it was \\"a piece of impudence for them to come here and ask the immunities of loyal citizens of America.\\"\\"Tennessee Legislature,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 20 May 1865, p. 2.

He resigned from the state senate on June 10, 1865, to take this position.\\"Tennessee Legislature,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 11 June 1865, p. 2. He had also reportedly started suffering from the symptoms of tuberculosis, which may have contributed to his decision to leave the senate. Later life In May 1866, Rodgers chaired a convention of East Tennessee Radicals who sought to form a separate state in East Tennessee, much like the East Tennessee Convention Rodgers had attended in 1861. The Radicals were frustrated with the failure of the state legislature to pass a second, more restrictive Franchise Bill (several legislators who were opposed to the bill had fled the capital several weeks earlier to prevent a quorum, leaving the bill in limbo). Shortly after the convention adjourned, however, the legislature passed the bill, and support for East Tennessee statehood collapsed.James Walter Fertig, The Secession and Reconstruction of Tennessee (University of Chicago Press, 1898), pp. 76-77.

Background Malamud began the initial composition of the novel in 1969 and completed it in 1971.Davis (2007), p. xxi Its plot concerns a rivalry between two writers—one of them a Jew and the other an African-American— who are the last two persons remaining in a soon to be condemned apartment building.Hemon, Aleksander The Tenants: An Introduction – Hemon provided the Introduction to the 2003 reissue of The Tenents. Before Malamud began writing this novel, he'd already \\"published two short stories treating relationships between blacks and Jews\\": \\"Angel Levine\\" (1955) and \\"Black Is My Favorite Color\\" (1963). And in at least one other story, \\"The Mourners\\" (1955), he had examined the fraught relationship between a tenant and a landlord. After he'd completed the novel, Malamud himself described The Tenants as a \\"tight, tense book, closer to the quality of short fiction.\\"Davis, Philip. \\"Bernard Malamud: A Writer's Life.\\" Oxford University Press,, 2007. . p 272 When Malamud was asked, during an interview, what \\"set off\\" the writing of his novel, he replied: \\"Jews and blacks, the period of the troubles in New York City; the teachers strike, the rise of black activism, the mix-up of cause and effect. I thought I'd say a word.\\" Malamud's biographer explains the genesis of the novel this way: Book summary A quick synopsis of the book's story was provided in the book jacket: As the story unfolds, all the building's residents have moved out with the exception of Lesser, who believes he's the sole remaining occupant and plans on staying until he completes his third novel. Lesser believes that it is crucial for him to remain in familiar surroundings so as not to break his writing routine. Then he hears the sound of a typewriter and soon discovers that it belongs to Willie Spearmint (who eventually adopts Bill Spear as a nom de plume) who has taken over one of the abandoned apartments as his writing space. The time of the novel seems to be set in the final years of the 1960s, \\"a time of racial strife affecting both the book's Jewish and black characters.\\" The novel's point of view is through Harry Lesser and \\"is rendered in third-person-limited narration.\\" See also * The Tenants, a 2005 film adaptation of the book Further reading *Leslie Fiedler, \\"Negro and Jew: Encounter in America,\\" in No! in Thunder: Essays on Myth and Literature (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1963), 241. *Herbert Mann, \\"The Malamudian World: Method and Meaning,\\" Studies in AmericanJewish Literature 4 (Spring 1978): p 7 *David R.

Both were acquired in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, and both were lost that year; her crew destroyed the first to avoid her capture, and the Americans captured the second. Both were named for General Sir Robert Pigot, the general commanding the British Army at Newport, Rhode Island, during their service there. First galley Pigot On 16 May 1778, Pigot, (or Pigott) took her station in the Seconnet. Pigot was the former tender, Lady Parker, a schooner, that had been fitted out as a galley. The British at Newport now had three galleys, , Pigot, and Spitfire. They also had a new galley equipping. Earlier, Lieutenant (and future admiral and baron) James Saumarez had commanded Lady Parker for some months until 17 February 1778, when he had been given command of Spitfire. Lieutenant Sir Henry Edwin Stanhope, of , was appointed to command the Pigot galley. On 25 May, the British launched the two-pronged Warren and Bristol raid. Pigot supported one division, which went up Warren Creek, where they succeeded in surprising and capturing an armed galley. Five days later, 100 men of the 54th Regiment of Foot embarked on boats to attack saw mills at Fall River, Massachusetts. Pigot and some armed boats were to provide support. Pigot grounded, but the attack proceeded anyway. A sharp skirmish ensued when the troops arrived at their objective. Even so, they were able to destroy one saw mill and one grain mill, as well as a large stock of planks and boards, other buildings, some cedar boats, and so on. They then withdrew, having lost two men killed and five officers and men wounded. As the tide returned, Pigot was floated off, but as Flora towed her off, Flora lost two men killed and a lieutenant severely wounded. Between 29 May and 18 July, the British captured a number of vessels: the sloops Sally and Fancy, snow Baron D'Ozell, Olive Branch, sloop Betsey, and schooner Sally. Pigot shared the prize money with , , , and . French Admiral d'Estaing's squadron arrived in Narragansett Bay on 29 July 1778 to support the American army under General George Washington during the battle of Rhode Island. On 30 July, four French ships of the line entered Narragansett Bay and positioned themselves north of Conanicut Island to support the American and French forces in the battle of Rhode Island. The arrival of the French vessels trapped several British vessels, Pigot among them. On 5 August 1778, Pigot lay anchored off Arnold's Point; Stanhope ran her ashore and set fire to her. The Royal Navy ended up having to destroy ten of their own vessels in all. Second galley Pigot Admiral Lord Howe bought on 19 July 1778 a brig that would become the second Pigot. This was well after the first Pigot was already deployed under her own name, but not long before Stanhope scuttled that Pigot. Apparently the Royal Navy registered her by Admiralty Order dated 22 December 1778, that is, some two months after the Americans had captured her. By end- August 1778, the American threat to Newport had ended. At some point, the British removed the upper deck of the brig they had bought and converted her to a galley of 200 tons (bm). They gave her eight 12-pounder guns that they had rescued from Flora, and ten swivel guns;Flora was the largest of the ten vessels the British had had to scuttle in August. she received the name Pigot, after Sir Robert. Lieutenant William Dunlop commissioned her, commanding a crew of 40-45 men. Capture Pigot took up her station in the Seconnet River. This proved to be a problem for the Americans and the American commander in Rhode Island, General John Sullivan decided to attempt to remove her. He appointed Major Silas Talbot to command of the schooner Hawk (or Hawke). Hawk belonged to the Providence River squadron that the Continental Army organized after the failure of the attack on Rhode Island. She was a small vessel, 70 tons (bm), armed with only two guns, both 3-pounders, and Talbot gathered 60 volunteers to man her. Hawk left Providence on 25 October but had to wait several times for better winds, or night. On the way she picked up 15 more men. On the night of 27 October Talbot launched his attack. He had rigged a kedge anchor to Hawks bowsprit so as he came up along Pigot he was able to tear open the anti-boarding nets she had rigged. At 2:30am on 28 October, Dunlop was awakened with the news that a strange vessel was approaching. He rushed on deck to discover that only the quartermaster and three men were on deck and that, in disregard of his orders, Pigots guns were not primed. He and the men on deck fired small arms, but a volley of small arms fire from the men on Hawk drove all but Dunlop below decks. Dunlop attempted to resist but was soon overpowered. There were no casualties on either side. Talbot sailed Pigot out to sea; he arrived at Stonington, Connecticut the next day. From there the Americans sent the prisoners to Providence, Rhode Island. They arrived there on 2 November and were incarcerated on board a prison ship. On 14 November the Continental Congress passed a resolution recognizing Talbot's feat in capturing Pigot, and promoted him to lieutenant colonel. The Rhode Island General Assembly awarded Talbot with an honour sword in recognition of his exploit. American service Pigot was condemned as a prize of war on 25 November.Pigot, - accessed 28 December 2014. Sullivan received the consent of the Rhode Island authorities to acquire some vessels. He bought Pigot in November, and the sloop Argo the next spring. The Americans took Pigot into service with Talbot as her captain. She served until 1779 and was sold in 1780. A Captain Clarke had replaced Talbot, who went on to command Argo. Governor Greene of Rhode Island, but then at Philadelphia, instructed William Ellery to have Clarke sail Pigot to Providence and that she be sold there as she was too rotten and too dull a sailer to warrant retaining in service, and it would be too expensive to refit her. Legend has it that she was subsequently burned.DANFS: Pigot Post- script The court-martial of Dunlop, his officers, and men resulted in the master, John Lanadale, being dismissed the service and imprisoned in the Marshalsea for one year for being in his hammock when he was supposed to have been on watch on deck. Also, Midshipman William Allen was severely reprimanded for having left the deck without having been properly relieved.

The attack is thought to have been a bid to rescue imprisoned members of Boko Haram. About 40 prisoners escaped from the prison; seven inmates and one prison warden died. The escaped prisoners were largely members of the insurgent. Incident The incident occurred on the morning of Sunday, 4 June 2012. It was reported that the terrorist attacked the prison through the Emir's palace during curfew hours imposed by the Yobe state government. The entrance of the terrorists drew the attention of the armed prison guards and other security agencies within the prison, resulting in an exchange of gunfire between the Boko Haram and security personnel. The escapees were largely members of the Boko Haram. The prison break resulted in the death of seven prisoners and a prison official, leaving several people injured.

It was founded in 1919 by a group of Deobandi scholars. Mufti Kifayatullah Dehlavi was elected the first president of the organization.History of Jamiat Ulama The Jamiat was an active participant in the Khilafat Movement in collaboration with the Indian National Congress. It also opposed the partition of India, taking the position of composite nationalism: that Muslims and non-Muslims form one nation. As a result, this organisation had a small break-away faction known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, which decided to support the Pakistan movement. After the death of its former president Asad Madni, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind split in to two factions. The first faction is headed by Arshad Madani and is known as A group or Jamiat Ulama-e- Hind (A). The other faction is headed by Qari Usman Mansoorpuri, but is known as Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind (M), as Mahmood Madani being its general secretary.https://m.etvbharat.com/urdu/national/state/delhi/100-years-of- jamiat-ulema-hind-completed/na20191206181034458 History Inception and founders The founders of the Jamiat in 1919 were the scholars Sheikh ul Hind Maulana Mehmood Hasan, Maulana Syed Husain Ahmad Madani, Maulana Ahmed Saeed Dehlvi, Mufti Kifayatullah Dehlavi, Mufti Muhammad Naeem Ludhianvi, Maulana Ahmed Ali Lahori, Maulana Bashir Ahmad Bhatta, Maulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri, Abdul Haq Akorwi, Maulana Abdul Haleem Siddiqui, Maulana Noor u Din Bihari and Maulana Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali.  Independence movement  During the British Raj, the Deobandi and Deoband-based organization was against the British rule in India and for a united India, opposing the formation of a separate homeland for Indian Muslims. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind was a member of the All India Azad Muslim Conference, which contained several Islamic organisations standing for a united India. Partition of India  Maulana Syed Husain Ahmad Madani, the principal of the Darul Uloom Deoband (1927–1957) and the leading Deobandi scholar, held that Muslims were unquestionably part of a united India and that Hindu-Muslim unity was necessary for the country's freedom. He worked closely with the Indian National Congress until the Partition of India was carried out. A faction under Shabbir Ahmad Usmani supporting the creation of Pakistan parted ways in 1945 to support the All Indian Muslim League. This faction came to be known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, and is currently a political party in Pakistan. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) at Islamopedia Online Scholar Ishtiaq Ahmed states that, in return for their support, the Jamiat obtained a pledge from the Indian leadership that the state would not interfere with the Muslim Personal Law in India. So far, the Indian state has kept its word.Ishtiaq Ahmed, The Pathology of Partition The Friday Times (newspaper), Published 6 November 2015, Retrieved 22 August 2019  Recent developments  The Jamiat has an organisational network which is spread all over India. It also has an Urdu daily Al-Jamiyat. The Jamiat has propounded a theological basis for its nationalistic philosophy. The thesis is that Muslims and non-Muslims have entered upon a mutual contract in India, since independence, to establish a secular state. The Constitution of India represents this contract. This is known in Urdu as a mu'ahadah. Accordingly, as the Muslim community's elected representatives supported and swore allegiance to this mu'ahadah, so it is the responsibility of Indian Muslims to support the Indian Constitution. This mu'ahadah is similar to a previous similar contract signed between the Muslims and the Jews in Medina.Islam in Modern History. By Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Pg 285. In 2009, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind said that Hindus should not be called kafirs (infidels), even though the term only means a \\"Non-Muslim,\\" because its use may hurt someone. After the death of its former President Asad Madni, Jamiat- Ulema-e-Hind split into two factions, one being presided by Arshad Madani and the other by Qari Usman Mansoorpuri.  Criticism  In November 2009 the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind passed a resolution describing Vande Mataram as an anti- Islamic song and received opposition from Muslim Rashtriya Manch national convener, Mohammed Afzal stating \\"Our Muslim brothers should not follow the fatwa as Vande Mataram is the national song of the country and every Indian citizen should respect and recite it.\\" A century of existence In 2019, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind will be observing its 100th anniversary since it was founded back in 1919.

It was composed in the early 1950s and was premiered in March 1954 in London. A performance takes about 15 minutes. History The Horn Trio was commissioned by the pianist Colin Horsley for hornist Dennis Brain, with whom he had enjoyed playing the Brahms Horn Trio. Together with the violinist Manoug Parikian, they gave the first performance of the trio for the Chamber Music Society at the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington, on Sunday, 28 March 1954 (; ). They also made the first recording, issued on HMV CLP 1029 . The year of composition is given variously as the late 1940s, 1952, 1953, and 1954 (; ; and ; and , respectively). The trio is one of Berkeley's most often performed and recorded chamber-music works . Analysis The trio is in three movements: #Allegro #Lento #Tema con variazioni The opening Allegro is dominated by the interval of the perfect fourth, and in general alternates pairs of the instruments, rather than using all three together. Although they are not the basis of the entire work, Berkeley's use of fourths in the opening of this movement resembles the free atonality of the Chamber Symphony No. 1 by Arnold Schoenberg, but this sound was also very much in the air amongst British composers at that time, in particular Michael Tippett's Piano Concerto . The character of this movement rests largely on its springy rhythms, moving at the end to a calm close in F major . The Lento is a slow dirge with a more lively middle section, and the only movement that shows much affinity with the Brahms trio (; ). The long main theme is given first to the horn and then the violin plays transformations of it . The last movement is in F major, and consists of a series of variations on an original theme that nevertheless strongly recalls Mozart . The theme is characterized at the beginning by a leap of a seventh and continues with a song-like melodic line, followed by ten variations . The sixth variation is a waltz, and the seventh uses the theme as a ground bass . The harmonies deliberately contrast triadic sonorities with chords built from fourths and sevenths, and there are recollections of motivic material from the first movement .

It was built from 1864 to . It is also known as Granite House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000. The present day neighbourhood of St Johns Wood takes its name from this early house.  History  Granite House with Cedar House, right. 1880 St John's Wood, a single storey residence, primarily built of local granite, was constructed in the mid-1860s for Daniel Rowntree Somerset. The neighbourhood of St John's Wood in Ashgrove is named after the house. Free settlement occurred in Brisbane, traditional country of the Yuggera and Turrbal people, from 1842. Land available for private ownership was progressively surveyed and offered for sale by the New South Wales government. Land was categorized as either \\"town\\", within gazetted towns and villages, \\"suburban\\", within of town boundaries or \\"country\\", beyond this radius. Early settlement was largely focussed on town land on opposite sides of the river at North Brisbane and South Brisbane, while suburban areas developed more slowly. The area that is now the suburb of Ashgrove was known as \\"Kallindarbin\\" by the Turrbal people. From at least the 1850s, the land was on which St John's Wood is located was contained within a large pastoral lease holding. The Gap pastoral station, watered by Enoggera Creek and extending west towards the Taylor Range, was taken up by Darby McGrath in 1851 to run sheep. At the second freehold sale of portions of this land in 1858, prominent pastoralist (later inaugural Member of the Queensland Legislative Council) John Frederick McDougall purchased Portion 164 and 165, an area of 12 hectares and 21 hectares. By the following year McDougall was the major landholder along Enoggera Creek and remained owner of Portions 164 and 165 until they passed to auctioneer Arthur Martin in 1863. Daniel Rowntree Somerset acquired Portions 164 and 165 and in 1867, portion 381. The latter two portions became the suburb of St John's Wood. Originally from Northern Ireland, Somerset arrived in Brisbane with his wife Dora and three children in 1850. For much of the 1850s he was a general merchant in partnership with John Richardson and was prominent in civic affairs, including the push for Separation of Queensland from New South Wales. In December 1859, he was appointed Chief Clerk and Shipping Master of the Port of Brisbane, a post he held until his retirement in 1876. The first half of the 1860s was a period of strong growth for Brisbane in the newly established colony of Queensland. Immigration boosted the population dramatically (more than doubling between 1861 and 1864 to over 12,000) and many substantial public and private buildings were constructed during this time. The urban environment of Brisbane's fledgling town centre, where residential dwellings co-existed in close proximity with commercial and industrial activity, was characterised by congestion, noise, and poor sanitation, common among other developing towns and cities in mid-19th century Australia. During this period \\"villa estates\\", located in the suburban periphery in then semi-rural settings – on elevated locations such as along ridgelines, and in some instances with river frontage – became an increasingly popular type of dwelling for Brisbane's more affluent residents. This demographic included the likes of higher ranking public servants, professionals and successful business people. The flight to residential villa estates by the well-to-do was a development pattern that occurred internationally during the Victorian era. Key elements of villa estates included large and comfortable houses, associated outbuildings such as servant's quarters and stabling, expansive garden settings, and a good road to town. In March 1865, the Brisbane Courier noted, \\"substantial brick villas, instead of wooden houses are on the increase\\". A later article in September stated, \\"numerous villa residences have been erected during the past 12 months in the suburbs of the town. No greater proof of the prosperity of a city as a whole can be afforded than that derived from the disposition of its citizens to plant and build on its environs, and to make it their home socially as well as professionally. Scarcely a day passes but our advertising columns invite tenders for the erection of villa residences\\". Sometime after acquiring the property, Somerset commissioned the construction of a residence. The designer and builder of the residence are unconfirmed. Joshua Jeays, a prominent Brisbane contractor, who designed and built the nearby villa Bardon House in 1863, has previously been linked to St. John's Wood but no firm evidence to support this has been identified. It is not known if any buildings or structures were already on Somerset's property, but highly unlikely as the purchase price was ₤450 The house was a single storey building with a formal symmetrical U-shaped plan, featuring substantial walls constructed of Enoggera granite, by the working to size of the exposed rocks on the nearby hillside. The Somersets occupied the house for only a short time. Dora Somerset died in February 1867, with her death notice indicating the residence was known by this time as St. John's Wood. The following month Daniel Somerset advertised the property for sale or let, describing the residence as \\"a substantial and well-finished Stone Dwelling House of eight rooms, and the necessary outbuildings, all in a state of thorough repair, and suitable for a respectable family\\". Somerset was still at St John's Wood in May 1868 when his eldest daughter Anna was married there. Shortly after, in June 1868, the house was leased to George Rogers Harding. George Rogers Harding George Rogers Harding was born on 3 December 1838 at Taunton, Somerset, England and undertook his legal training prior to immigrating to Australia. Harding and his wife Emily (née Morris) arrived in Brisbane in 1866 with their three daughters and servant. He was admitted to the Bar shortly after arrival, as the first equity counsel in the colony. In July 1879 he became senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Over the course of his career, Harding was respected for his \\"scrupulously fair\\" judgements, except when his harsh sentences for unionists convicted during the conspiracy trial after the 1891 shearer's strike made him unpopular. Author of six legal books and a noted bibliophile, Harding played a large part in establishing the Supreme Court's library. Harding married Isabella Grahame on 23 December 1889 following Emily's death in May of that year. In 1874, Harding became the owner of the property, residing at St John's Wood with his family for another two decades. It was in 1874 that Ash-grove, the name of the future suburb, first appears, as Harding's address in the Post Office Directory. A keen property speculator, over time Harding extended the estate to include an area from Bailey's Quarry to Betheden at Ashgrove and from Sir Charles Lilley's Quarry to Glen Lyon Estate. Harding donated 2 acres (0.81 hectares) of land on Waterworks Road in 1876 to establish the Ashgrove Provisional School (now Ashgrove State School). In June 1877 architect Richard Gailey called tenders for alterations and additions to Harding's residence. Part of the additions included a ballroom, created by infilling the space (in brick) between the two wings of the house. The need for extra space at St John's Wood was influenced by the size of the Harding family; of 15 children born, 12 survived George and Emily. Next to the main house was another large building, mostly of cedar, with a shingled roof and 10 rooms. The designer and date of construction of this building (later referred to as the \\"Cedar House\\" to differentiate from the \\"Granite House\\") is unknown; the first evidence of its existence is an 1880s photograph of St John's Wood. This building was moved to a new site in 1926 and burnt down shortly after. Over the course of the Hardings' occupancy other improvements occurred at the property including an access road to the property and stabling. Part of the estate, on the other side of Waterworks Road, near the present Orchard Avenue, was the site of a citrus orchard, thought to have been cared for by the important botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. Some sources have stated the orchard was 10 acres (4.05 hectares), but in 1877 Harding advertised for sale by auction the \\"Ashgrove Orangery\\", a 37-acre (15.18 ha) orchard featuring 900 citrus trees \\"just coming into fruit\\". St. John's Wood Dance Card 1886 St John's Wood became renowned for its gatherings, with Harding \\"having taken a leading part in the social life of Brisbane\\". Events were often reported in the social columns of Brisbane's newspapers and according to Sir Charles Lilley, the house was \\"always a popular place with the younger folk in the ordinary rounds of social entertainment\\". An oft-repeated claim is that Prince Albert and Prince George (later George V) spent time at St John's Wood in 1881, due to Harding's friendship with the Prince of Wales, Edward II. Contemporary reports extensively covered their busy three-day schedule and while they did attend a ministerial picnic at the Enoggera Waterworks (and thus had an opportunity to visit riding there and back) there is no record of any time spent at St John's Wood. A later visit by George V and his wife Mary in 1901 during their Federation tour is even more unlikely, as no Hardings resided at St John's Wood by this time. The stories of the royal visits appear to have been a way of marketing Francis Anglim's \\"high class suburb\\", when the property was subdivided in the 1920s (see below). Interior of Granite House at St. John's Wood, Brisbane, 1924 George Harding died in August 1895. He died intestate and had amassed considerable debt through his property speculation. In the months after his death, the household furniture and effects of St John's Wood were sold off, \\"the result of good taste and the accumulation of a lifetime\\". An auction catalogue of Harding's effects described St John's Wood as containing a drawing room, dining room, large hall, smaller hall, library, \\"best\\" bedroom, dressing room, bachelor's room, seven other bedrooms, pantry, lumber room, two servants rooms, kitchen laundry and stables. This extensive list suggests the Cedar House and other buildings were included in this description. Part of a building that originally extended from the rear of the main building (to the west), thought to have been the servant's quarters and kitchen/laundry, survives on the adjacent property. Granite House, St Johns Wood 1924 The Hardings' link to St John's Wood ended by July 1896, when the property was advertised to let, \\"one of the most complete and best appointed properties in the colony\\". In 1898 ownership of the land passed from administrators of Harding's estate, the Union Trustee Company of Australia, to the Queensland National Bank. In subsequent years St John's Wood was advertised to let a number of times and for auction in 1912. Little is known about the occupancy of the place during this period. Post Office Directories record James Pitkeathly at St Johns Wood from 1906 to 1910-11; the 1908 entry mentions a dairy, so this may have been how the land was being used at the time. In 1910 and 1911, scout troops conducted activities, including camping and cooking competitions, on the property. In 1914, advertisements for the sale of thoroughbred horses at St Johns Wood appear. Francis Michael Anglim, who became owner of the property in 1917, was a thoroughbred horse breeder. His name appears in relation to St John's Wood in 1915, so it is possible he may have been renting the property earlier. Anglim's 1931 obituary states he resided at St John's Wood for 21 years (from 1910). War-related fundraising functions were held at St John's Wood in 1915, but the resident of the house is not identified in reports of these events. Gravel drive up to the front of St John's Wood in Ashgrove Brisbane In the 1920s, the suburb of Ashgrove underwent rapid development. Until this time, the area was still fairly sparsely settled in comparison with suburbs closer to the city. The extension of the tramline in 1924 led to a number of subdivisions of large landholdings for housing. This included Glen Lyon Gardens, Oakleigh and Graham estates, and St John's Wood. St John's Wood was advertised by Anglim as a housing estate from 1924, \\"good enough for His Majesty the King\\". With 244 lots subdivided by 1926, the area surrounding the house was reduced to just over 1 acre (0.51 hectares). By 1950 the original building had been converted into flats and in 1958 the lot was further subdivided, which reoriented property frontage and access from Laird Street to Piddington Street. When Jules and Judithann Guerassimoff purchased the house in 1968, the of continuous verandah had been partially enclosed and the former ballroom was in use as a workshop. During their ownership some restoration work occurred at the house, which included returning the place to a single residence. St John's Wood was purchased by new owners in 1987 who still occupy the house in 2014.  Description  St John's Wood is a single storey residence, square in plan and built of granite with a hipped roof originally sheeted with timber shingles, now replaced with corrugated iron. It is surrounded on all sides by verandahs supported by timber posts. The four brick chimneys have brick string courses and caps. An entrance in the eastern facade is centrally located under a projecting portico with gable. The pediment has understated timber detailing and is supported by three verandah posts on each side. This was originally the front entrance. The cedar double paneled door has glazed sidelights and a semi-circular fanlight. The southern side of the house has now become the street frontage. French doors open onto the verandahs from all major rooms except the ballroom. Internally, the front door opens into an entrance hall which opens to the ballroom, the principal room in the house. The ballroom is lit by a skylight set into a rectangular roof lantern. The ballroom is surrounded by the remainder of the house. Pressed metal ceilings feature throughout the house and are emphasised by the height of the ceilings and the polished timber floors. Detailing is fine with extensive cedar joinery and marble fireplaces to the main bedroom, living and dining rooms To either side of the entrance hall are two equally proportioned rooms. The remaining rooms open from the ballroom. The southern wing contains the dining and the modern kitchen. The northern wing houses two bedrooms, one of which contains an ensuite bathroom. To the south a modern brick laundry and guesthouse are connected to the house by a covered walkway. The remaining garden and mature trees provide a pleasant and private setting for the house.  Heritage listing  St John's Wood was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St John's Wood, the first major house in the suburb of St John's Wood, gave the suburb its name, and plays a key role in demonstrating the pattern of settlement and growth of Brisbane's north- western suburbs. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. St John's Wood is significant for its rarity because it is an 1860s house built primarily of granite quarried in the vicinity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The 1860s stone residence is significant for its aesthetic quality, craftsmanship and intactness, including the internal cedar joinery, skylight, pressed metal ceilings throughout, stonework and original beech floors. The house and grounds are significant also for their landmark quality. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

An academic, writer and translator, Kennett was elected president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, serving for a short time before his early death. His 1696 Romæ Antiquæ Notitia, or the Antiquities of Rome was considered the subject's standard handbook for a century. Biography Basil Kennett was born at Postling, Kent, on 21 October 1674, and was younger brother of White Kennett, bishop of Peterborough. He was educated under the care of his brother at a school at Bicester and in the family of Sir William Glynne at Ambrosden, Oxfordshire. In 1689 he entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, under the tuition of his brother, who was then vice-principal. According to Biographia Britannica, \\"he sat down to his studies with remarkable diligence ... so that he soon became distinguished both by his genius, and the extraordinary advances he made in classical and polite literature.\\" In 1690 he was elected scholar of Corpus Christi College as a native of Kent, and graduated B.A. in 1693, M.A. in 1696. In the same year he published his Romæ Antiquæ Notitia or the Antiquities of Rome, to which he prefixed two essays on the Roman Learning and Education. These essays were the first attempts of the kind made in any language at that time; and the book was so well received by the public, that he was thereby encouraged to prosecute his design of promoting and facilitating the study of classical learning. In that view he proceeded to draw up The Lives and Characters of the ancient Greek Poets, which came out in 1697. The same year, on the 14th of February, he was admitted Fellow of Corpus Christi College, and became a tutor there. It was probably about this time, pursuant to the college-statutes, that he entered into Holy Orders: after which, directing the course of his studies in a more particular manner to Divinity, he published in 1705, An Exposition of the Apostles Creed, according to Bishop Pearson, in a new Method, by way of Paraphrase and Annotations. This was followed in 1706 by An Essay towards a Paraphrase on the Psalms in Verse, with a Paraphrase on the third Chapter of the Revelations. According to the Dictionary of National Biography, his learning and amiable qualities won him the regard of all parties. In the late 16th century Livorno - Leghorn - in Tuscany became an English Navy base for patrolling shipping routes in the Mediterranean Sea, thereby attracting a large English community to the city. According to Villani, \\"The history of the British Factory of Leghorn is also the history of the conflicts that its members had with the Tuscan authorities to assert their right to live openly their religious beliefs. One of the questions that for a long time poisoned the relationships between the English and Tuscans in those years was the attempt made by the British Factory to obtain permission to celebrate Protestant religious services for its members. The religious authorities were against any concession — not because they were afraid of a possible Protestant proselytism, but because they feared the emergence of a spontaneous doctrine of tolerance among the Catholics.\\" Against this context, and at the instigation of his brother White Kennett and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Basil Kennett was in 1706 appointed chaplain to the British factory at Leghorn, being the first to fill that office, and received the degree of B.D. by decree of convocation. The suggestion is made that he took up the post with some reluctance. He was at first much harassed by the Inquisition - the Roman Catholic Church's institutions dedicated against heresy - and had to seek the intervention of the English government, which promised military reprisals for any 'molestation given to her chaplain'. Ill-health, caused by the climate and his dislike of exercise, obliged him to resign, and he preached for the last time on 8 January 1712–13. He returned home by way of Florence, Rome, and Naples, and through France, collecting books, sculpture, and curiosities. He resumed residence at Corpus Christi in 1714, became D.D., and during the same year was elected president of his college, although he was ‘even then very sickly.’ He died of fever on 3 January 1714–15, and was buried in the college chapel.

The organisation's stated vision is \\"to see a world inspired by the unique personality of Hussain: his actions and his compassion for those around him.\\" Hussain ibn Ali Hussain, son of Ali and Fatimah and the grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, lived 1400 years ago in Arabia, and is recognized as an important figure in Islam, as he was a member of the Ahl al-Bayt (the household of Prophet Muhammad) and Ahl al-Kisa, as well as being the third Shia Imam. He is most well known for his death in the battle of Karbala, 61 A.H./680 AD, in which Hussain and his companions fought the caliph Yazid and his army of circa 30,000. Who is Hussain cites this battle as epitomising Hussain's greatest qualities, saying that while Hussain had little or no hope of victory for himself, it was hoped the stand would shake the nation's conscience to battle the injustice and immorality Hussain felt present in Arabia. According to Who is Hussain the battle of Karbala laid the foundations for the overthrow of the Caliph's dynasty. The organisation also seek to highlight other stories of Hussain's life to promote compassion, honour and integrity. For example, \\"a celebrated example was when he and his brother Hassan cared tirelessly for a poor blind man they came upon in their city, in spite of traditional social expectations. Water and event of Karbala The event of Karbala holds a core concern with water shortage, this is why supply of water is provided without considering race or religion. The organization donated 30,000 bottles of water to the Red Cross in Flint Michigan during the water contamination crisis in early 2016. A similar move was also arranged in India at local level with the motivation that Hussain stands as a timeless example for all irrespective of their faith or color Repeating the tradition of water supply, team of volunteers to introduce their campaign distributed the bottles of water tagged with information about Hussain Ibn Ali in Seattle, Washington, US.  Website  whoishussain.org Who is Hussain's website is the group's main platform for sharing the message of Hussain ibn Ali, which explains the full story of Hussain's life, details of how to get involved in promoting the campaign, famous quotes of Hussain, merchandise and how to request an information pack. Upon launch in 2012, the website was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. Since its launch in December 2012, the website has had over 100,000 unique hits from over 30 countries.  Global presence  Over time the organisation began to gain international recognition. In 2013, Who is Hussain began to accumulate global representatives. These representatives are local ambassadors for the organisation with a twofold purpose: (i) the organisation of local advertising promoting Who is Hussain and in particular its website and (ii) putting on goodwill and charitable events in honour of and 'inspired by' Hussain ibn Ali. Examples of these initiatives include blood donation drives, initiating food collections for the homeless and winter coat collections for the elderly. As at December 2014, Who is Hussain had 68 representatives in cities across the globe. Each representative liaises with the central London team on a periodic basis. Representatives span cities in five continents including Chicago, Ottawa, Sydney, Adelaide, Birmingham, Karachi, Stockholm, Cape Town and Christchurch.  #TeamGiveBack  In November 2014, Who is Hussain launched a campaign entitled '#TeamGiveBack'. The aim of the campaign was to engage with the public on social media to identify how Hussain ibn Ali inspired them. The public was invited to donate to Iraq Relief Fund (Iraq being the site of Hussain's shrine). Who is Hussain encouraged individuals to 'give back' to the community.

Just like jeepneys, they have fixed routes. Although, there are multicabs that serve as taxicabs where passengers go exactly where they want, as a tricycle might. Aside from being a mode of mass transportation, it can also be customized for other purposes such as a pickup truck or a private van. Multicabs can be found throughout the Philippines. It can be found in urban areas such as Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao. A multicab is lightweight, narrow and small and can navigate through narrow streets. With seating capacity of around 11 to 13, the passenger space also tends to be cramped relative to a van. There are also multicabs that have a seating capacity less than 11. Small multicabs typically have three-cylinder engines. In Tacloban, there are plans to convert the multicab engines into rechargeable batteries for sustainable energy. A multicab is about as comfortable as a jeepney, and usually has a cleaner and less noisy engine. A group travelling by multicab may hire a multicab for a day (e.g. for family use) and pay the daily fee, while optionally buying food and drink for the driver. A multicab is typically assembled in a factory in the Philippines with surplus parts from Japan and South Korea, in contrast to jeepneys, which are usually hand-made. Popular makes are Suzuki models such as, Suzuki LMM 376 and Suzuki Every 660, or more rugged cousin, the Suzuki Scrum. Multicab models sometimes also using Daihatsu Hijet S100.

Campbell (April 25, 1845 January 4, 1904), also known as T. C. Campbell, was an American lawyer and Republican political boss. Biography Campbell was born on April 25, 1845 in Rochester, New York, to Scottish American parents. On his sixteenth birthday, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, he enlisted in the Union Army and rose to the rank of Colonel. He was honorably discharged in the fall of 1865. After leaving the army, Campbell moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked as a bookkeeper while studying law at the Cincinnati Law School. In 1867, he was elected quartermaster general of the Grand Army of the Republic and appointed editor of its official organ, The Republic. He was elected to City Council in 1868 and the following year was appointed Assistant Collector of Internal Revenue of the Cincinnati district. In March 1870, Campbell completed his studies and began practicing law in the city. The next year, he was elected prosecuting attorney. During his two terms as prosecutor, his successes included prosecutions for electoral fraud, a defense of the police chief in a friendly fire incident, and a prosecution against the city controller for illegally reissuing bonds. Campbell was retained for ten years by the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune and Cincinnati Enquirer. In the 1870s and 1880s, Campbell had a reputation for jury fixing and was blamed for much of the corruption in the Hamilton County court system. Reprinted from The Sun (New York). With his protégé, George B. Cox, he controlled much of city government. They were supported by The Cincinnati Enquirer and its Democratic publisher John Roll McLean. In 1883, The Cincinnati Post launched a series of attacks against Campbell. Campbell responded by suing the paper for libel in front of a partially fixed jury. Amid threats from the Cox machine, the Post hired bodyguards for its editors and managers. In 1884, Campbell founded the Cincinnati Telegram, a daily afternoon newspaper, mainly for the purpose of lampooning Post editors. After one of Campbell's juries triggered the Courthouse riots of 1884, one of the most destructive riots in American history, prominent attorneys including William Howard Taft began disbarment proceedings against Campbell. He was only temporarily disbarred, but the episode had ended his influence. Cox would later take Campbell's place as head of the city's Republican machine. In 1888, Campbell moved from his College Hill home to New York City. The next year, the Post put the Telegram out of business by secretly financing its unsuccessful move to morning publication. Campbell continued practicing law both in New York and in Ohio. He was twice nominated to run for Congress but declined both times. He became active in New York politics, turning a reliable Tammany Hall district into a Republican stronghold and helping to send his law partner John Ford to the state senate. On January 3, 1904, Campbell arrived in New York harbor, having fallen ill aboard the yacht Roamer when it went ashore at Rum Cay in the Bahamas. He died in his sleep the next day in Brooklyn.

Designed by architect Alfred Charles Finn, the building was built in 1923 in the Spanish colonial style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1982. History The State National Bank Building was designed by local architect Alfred C. Finn (1883–1964). Lacking formal training, he came to Houston while working as a draftsman for Sanguinet & Staats of Fort Worth. He stayed with the firm's Houston office for about a year, contributing to the design of two homes in the Courtlandt Place subdivision. He left for private practice in 1913 and remained in Houston. His secured his first commission for a major building as a contractor for Mauran, Russell & Crowell of St. Louis, who hired Finn to supervise the construction of the new seventeen-story Rice Hotel. Finn built at least two other skyscrapers, the Houston Chronicle Building (1913) and the Rusk Building (1916), before his work on the State National Building. It represents the work of an architect of regional importance, and by 1982, represented \\"one of the few surviving Neo-Classical skyscrapers in the city of Houston.\\" State National Bank originates from the State Bank and Trust Company, chartered by the state of Texas and opened in 1915. Five years later the bank joined the Federal Reserve System, which led to an alienation of its state charter in favor of a national bank charter. The name changed to State National Bank, which engaged American Construction Company to start building a new skyscraper in 1922. Construction costs are estimated at $500,000 and the building was completed in 1923. The building was soon fully leased and remained so until 1946, when State National Bank vacated its namesake building. In 1947, the real estate brokerage of Huster and Wise purchased the State National Bank Buildings and its two flanking properties for $720,000. Building features The skyscraper is in the neo-classical mode with Beaux Arts ornamentation. The first three stories are composed of a first and second story separated by a mezzanine, forming the base of the structure. This base is faced in rough-cut granite, features several ornaments, and displays a large engraving of the motto, “Frugality is the mother of all virtues.” A high arch envelopes the main entry, originally fronted by bronze gates, and further embellished with tablets and lighting fixtures made of bronze. The façade for the upper seven stories are arranged bays with double-hung windows, with interspersed ornaments. A marble stairway leads to the basement, the location of the bank's vaults, conference rooms, and a boiler room. The main lobby is decked in concrete and marble. An aperture in the ceiling provides a partial view of the mezzanine level.Axelrad (1982), p. 2. After the first sale of the building, the new owners replaced the rough-hewn granite cladding with polished Indiana limestone in 1948. They removed the banking equipment from the lobby to accommodate a broader range of retail business, while closing off the mezzanine. They also added a metal portico to support a canopy. During the 1960s and 1970s, the building suffered from neglect like many other buildings in downtown Houston. However, starting in 1981 leading up to the property's NRHP-listing in 1983, a new ownership group began restoration of the State National Bank Building. All tenants vacated the building, while workers removed the limestone cladding and endeavored a comprehensive restoration.Axelrad (1982), pp. 4–5.

Description and history The firm of Alfred C. Finn designed the building for City National Bank in 1947. City National Bank was the name of the Houston bank which descended from Guaranty Trust Company, the original bank founded by James Anderson Elkins, Sr. in 1924. National Archives Identifier: 40972408. When the building first opened, the bank leased the retail frontage to Corrigan's Jewelry, while the bank occupied the rest of the ground space, but with ceilings raised to a third floor elevation. The bank also let 19 floors of the upper floors as office space. The top two floors are reserved for the building's infrastructure. The McKinney Street side of the building takes the whole block running from Main Street to Fannin Street, running 250 feet along that side. Instead of a rectangular profile, the top floors form the smallest tier, and each tier grows broader until the building's base, which occupies the whole lot. The Main Street side of the building has a narrow profile. The building also featured modern infrastructure, including eight high-speed elevators, and a kind of modular flooring which hid the conduits. The City National Bank Building leased almost all of its space by the time it had opened. Among it tenants were well-known national companies such as Braniff, DuPont, Humble Oil (later known as Exxon), Monsanto, and Phillips Petroleum. A local radio station, KPRC, transmitted from the 23rd floor. City National Bank operated out of the ground floor lobby for about a decade. A parking garage was added in 1999, but it is not attached to the original building. The building has direct access to the Houston underground pedestrian system.

Jerome of Worcester, Massachusetts in 1958. Jerome created what he termed a \\"revolutionary vehicle\\" due to concern with what he saw as 1950's Detroit's lack of concern with safety and focus on planned obsolescence. While never produced commercially the Sir Vival featured many innovative car safety concepts that would later become standard such as seat belts, a roll cage, sliding side doors, rubber bumpers, and side lights. However, the most distinctive feature of the car are a two-part construction that separates the engine and front wheels from the main passenger cab via an articulated universal joint and the driver's turret, an elevated seat where the driver commands a near-360 degree visibility, thanks to a cylindrical glass enclosure. Along with the 1957 Aurora it is one of the earliest Experimental Safety Vehicles ever made. History Creating the Sir Vival prototype was a 10-year mission of Walter Jerome, a graduate of Northeastern University's College of Engineering. He created it from a 1948 Hudson, purchased from a Hudson dealer in Bellingham, Massachusetts. He drew up blueprints and enlisted students of his at the Worcester Boys' Trade School. The actual Sir Vival bears little resemblance to the original Hudson. Features According to the marketing pamphlet written by Jerome entitled \\"Sir Vival. An Adventure in Safe Motoring\\" the prominent features of the car were: * Two-piece engine and cab. Perhaps the most noticeable design element of the Sir Vival is the two-part segmented chassis. The engine and front wheels sit in a separate section which in turn is connected to the passenger cab by an articulated joint. The rationale was that in a front or side collision the sections would articulate around the vertical axis and absorb the critical shock of the collision. * Driver turret. The driver of the Sir Vival sat in a single elevated seat about 3 feet above the level of the rear passenger seat. To increase visibility, the Sir Vival \\"windshield\\" was a cylinder of glass about one foot high and four feet in circumference. Marketing and reception It was Jerome's belief that the safety of the American motoring public had for too long been ignored by the Detroit manufacturers and that he could lure the safety conscious auto-buyer by stressing safety and the \\"breathtaking design\\" of his car. He intended to produce 10-12 cars a year at a retail price of $10,000. This was not an inconsequential price tag given that a Series 62 Cadillac started at around $5,000 at that time. To market the Sir Vival Jerome created the Hollow Boring Corporation of Worcester and spent many years looking for purchasers and financing. In the process he displayed the vehicle at automotive and popular events such as the International Auto Show, the 1964 New York World's Fair, the Springfield Exposition, and the 1959 Foreign and Sports Car Show in Boston. The Sir Vival received publicity in Life magazine and automotive focused publications such as Mechanix Illustrated and Motor Trend magazines. It was covered in many foreign publications as well. The publications were generally neutral on the viability of the car but stressed the safety features and the technological advancements. Despite the press and the showings at high-profile venues, Jerome never garnered the funding needed to manufacture another Sir Vival, and so the prototype remains the only version ever produced.

It was built from 1880s to 1930s. It is also known as Clarke's Farm and Glen Urquhart. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1997.  History  Professor John Henry Pepper Woodlands is situated on part of the 30 acres of land originally purchased in 1868 by James Clarke and known as Clarke's Farm. From at least 1882 Clarke and a William Reinhold prospected for gold on the property. In 1883, the land, together with a small house and outbuildings, was sold to William Widdop, although Clarke and Reinhold continued their activities. In the same year, Professor John Henry Pepper leased the property for himself and his family. Pepper, an analytical chemist, also had an interest in other branches of the sciences, particularly the application of electricity. He had arrived in Brisbane in 1881 after gaining a name in his native England and abroad as an educator and populariser of science and for introducing evening classes to the London Polytechnic. He gave lectures and staged entertaining demonstrations including the famous illusion named Pepper's ghost. In Brisbane, he gave early demonstrations of electric light and of the gramophone as well as setting up courses in science at schools and introducing chemistry classes at the School of Arts. He also opened a laboratory in Queen Street as a consulting analytical chemist. He is credited with the first formal teaching of chemistry in Queensland. Following an agreement made in 1883 with Widdop, who agreed to sell the property to Pepper if no payable gold was found, Pepper erected a house on the property, which is now known as \\"Woodlands\\". In 1886 this agreement became the subject of a legal dispute that was settled in favour of Pepper, who then purchased the land. In 1889 he sold the property to Charles Plant and returned to England. Plant, who had extensive gold mining interests in north Queensland, including the Venus Battery, used the property to stay at when in Brisbane until he retired there in 1897/8 for the benefit of his children's education. About this time he erected a grand house for himself, adjacent to Pepper's house, which he named \\"Ferndale\\" and erected a decorative wrought iron fence along Woodland Street that enclosed both houses. Pepper's former house was rented out until 1922, when the land was subdivided in anticipation of the marriage of Plant's elder daughter, Hilda. The house and land were placed in the name of her fiance, John MacDonald Grant, who had been in military service at Gallipoli and in France with Eric and Reg Plant, two of Hilda's brothers. In the same year, Plant made a similar provision for his other daughter, Oenone, transferring land between the former Pepper house and Ferndale to her future husband, John Finlay. This land was not built on however, and was used until the 1950s as an extension to the garden of the Grant's home, which they called Glen Urquhart. In 1933 a new room in the current, Art Deco style was added to the south east corner of the house by architects Addison and MacDonald. In 1932 Charles Plant died and in 1936 the land on which Ferndale stood was subdivided and the house was demolished. It had featured handsome carved cedar joinery and a ballroom surmounted by a lantern decorated with leadlight panels. These panels and some decorative joinery were then incorporated into the Grant home. Hilda Grant died in 1943 after prolonged ill health. She had been deeply involved with the Australian Red Cross in both World Wars, being President of the Ashgrove Branch in World War II and Convenor of the Ithaca Branch of the Australian Comforts Fund. She was also commissioner for Girl Guides in the 1930s. John Grant lived until the age of 94, dying in 1977. Although he was trained as an engineer, becoming Chief Assistant Engineer for Brisbane Tramways, he retained his military associations after World War I. In 1938 he was appointed to command and raise the 61st Battalion of the Queensland Cameron Highlanders, which he did with notable success. They were later to play a significant role in the Battle of Milne Bay in 1942. Grant was also inaugural president of the Ashgrove RSL. During his presidency between 1932–35, committee meetings were held at his home. Woodland Street remains the official Ashgrove marshalling area on Anzac Day, a reminder of Grant's early role in organising Anzac Day observances in the area. Following his death, the land accompanying the house was subdivided into two blocks. Lot No. 2 on which the house is located was purchased by its present owners, Mrs Janet and Major Austin Hogan in 1979 and named \\"Woodlands\\" the house having no name. Mrs Janet Hogan is a recognised author on Queensland's heritage and is well known for her work in furthering an awareness of the State's heritage, especially the built environment. In co- operation with newspapers, magazines and television stations, she has worked on the production of many educational programmes. Mrs Janet and Major Austin have both played integral roles in the National Trust of Queensland and in recognition of their work, they have both been awarded Honorary Life Membership of the National Trust.  Description  Entrance, 2015 Front garden, 2015 Woodlands is today situated on half an acre of land. The garden contains large mature trees, including a weeping fig, silky oaks, jacarandas, poincianas, Moreton Bay chestnuts, casuarinas, pines, flame trees and an albizia. It has a privet hedge along the front fence dating from at least the 1920s. A decorative wrought iron fence, gates and matching tree guards, constructed of Lowmoor iron and marked Baleys Patent Albion, survive from Charles Plant's time. The house is a single storey, timber building on stumps, low set at the front and high at the back where the land falls away to the former mining gully. The main, 1883 section is roughly square in plan, with walls of single skin, vertical beaded tongue and groove boards on a hardwood frame that has pegged tenoned joints visible at external door heads and windows. The roof is clad with corrugated iron. It has six main rooms with front and back hallways leading into the dining room. The joinery is cedar and the large cedar fireplace remains in the dining room. There are timber fretwork roses in the twelve foot ceilings. Cedar French doors with fanlights open onto the formerly encircling verandahs. The hall/dining room doors have etched and coloured glass panels in the upper sections. The leadlights believed to have been transferred from Ferndale have distinctive geometric patterns and have been incorporated as decorative features in internal and external walls and some fanlights. Wall panels are generally accompanied by elaborately carved cedar shelf/brackets, believed also to come from Ferndale. Externally, the \\"new room\\" added in 1933 sits comfortably at the corner of the house but has some distinctive details, in particular the concave sweep between the upper eaves and verandah roof levels of the original house, the sweep being clad with cedar shingles. Internally it has a plaster \\"art deco\\" ceiling, silky oak joinery and panelling, including panelled doors with crossed diagonal decorative mouldings. The diagonal cross design is repeated in the casement windows and in the fixed and sliding leadlight panels that replaced the wall dividing this room from the drawing room. The adjoining verandah, now a breakfast room has cedar bi-fold windows that match the design of the casements in the \\"new room\\". There is a fireplace for an electric fire that survives. Some modernisation also carried out in other rooms at the time, includes the installation of a matching fireplace in the drawing room and its Art Deco green tiling, a terrazzo hearth and a green enamel stove in the original brick stove recess of the kitchen. The house retains its 1930s form, together with a high degree of intact detail, including door furniture and the remains of gas lighting in the bedrooms. The bedrooms also have built-in hand basins set in timber beaded cupboards.  Heritage listing  Woodlands was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1883, Woodlands and its grounds are important for the evidence they provide of the way of life of prosperous citizens in the outer reaches of Brisbane in the late nineteenth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is important as an example of a fine quality 1880s residence that is substantially intact, both internally and externally. The grounds and gardens, which contain mature plantings including several specimen trees, an early privet hedge and rare surviving ironwork fence and gates, contribute to the overall integrity of the property. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The fine quality of interior finishes and fixtures, which include extensive decorative cedar joinery and leadlight panels give Woodlands considerable aesthetic significance. The large room, which was added in 1933, is of interest as an unusual and intact example of an Art Deco style interior incorporating extensive timber panelling and strong diagonal cross designs for the windows, doors and screens. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Woodlands, is important for its association with several notable owners who have contributed to the development of Queensland in the fields of education, mining, defence, community service and the heritage conservation movement. For their work in furthering an awareness of the State's heritage, Mrs Janet and Major Austin Hogan are particularly noted.

Development  \\"Patagón\\" prototype displayed at the Argentine Army Exhibition in May 2008. Note placard with technical data summary. In 2003 the Argentine Army defined goals for increasing its capabilities, among them nationalizing the manufacturing of its equipment; the VC SK-105 \\"Patagón\\" tank upgrade project was part of that effort. It was planned to convert and upgrade up to 40 vehicles at an expected cost of USD 23,4 million in the period 2005-2009; these vehicles were going to be assembled in Comodoro Rivadavia and provided to the army units based in the Patagonia. The vehicle is composed of a SK-105 Kürassier chassis which mounts a refurbished FL-12 oscillating turret armed with a 105 mm gun, obtained from obsolete AMX-13 tanks. Both vehicles were in service with the Argentine Army in the early 2000s. Most of the Patagón technical specifications are similar to the SK-105. The Patagón prototype was unveiled on 22 November 2005; however the project was cancelled in late 2008, as it was considered uneconomical.

Producing goods for trade has been an important economic activity in the state, especially in the Central Valleys region since the pre-Hispanic era which the area laid on the trade route between central Mexico and Central America. In the colonial period, the Spanish introduced new raw materials, new techniques and products but the rise of industrially produced products lowered the demand for most handcrafts by the early 20th century. The introduction of highways in the middle part of the century brought tourism to the region and with it a new market for traditional handcrafts. Today, the state boasts the largest number of working artisans in Mexico, producing a wide range of products that continue to grow and evolve to meet changing tastes in the market. Oaxacan handcrafts are also highly specialized by community. Notable wares include the barro negro pottery of San Bartolo Coyotepec, the green glazed and other pottery of Santa María Atzompa, the wool textiles of Teotitlán del Valle and surrounding communities, the mezcal of Tlacolula de Matamoros (and numerous other towns and villages) and a newcomer, colorful animal figures carved from wood made in San Antonio Arrazola and San Martín Tilcajete. Most of the production is in the Central Valleys, but artisans can be found all over the state including the Chinantla area with its huipils, the Tehuantepec area with its traditional clothing and jewelry made of gold coins and palm frond woven goods from the Mixtec area of the state. Status and distinguishing characteristics A \\"proto-turntable\\" and figure in progress from the Carlomagno Pedro Martínez workshop in San Bartolo Coyotepec The state of Oaxaca is one of the main and best-known producers of handcrafts (which includes certain kinds of processed foods) in Mexico. Its long tradition of production since the pre-Hispanic period along with an abundance of raw materials has allowed this tradition to stand out both in quality and the variety. The most successful products are ceramics and textiles, followed by those made from wood and leather. Other production includes wood carving, metal work, embroidery, leatherwork, fireworks, papel picado, stone work, furniture and more. One distinguishing feature of Oaxaca handcrafts is specialization of production by community, which began in the pre-Hispanic period supported by a complex web of regional markets. This tradition is maintained because of the state's mountainous terrain and poverty, which has inhibited the development of transportation infrastructure allowing communities to remain relatively autonomous and fractured politically and socially. This tradition is one of the strongest in Mexico, and the state has the highest number of artisans with 58,398 in 2012. The regional market system also remains in place to make handcrafts widely available in the state, especially in the Central Valleys region. The strongest indigenous influences on Oaxacan handcrafts are Zapotec and Mixtec. Local materials also have an effect on what is produced. In San Bartolo Coyotepec, the local clay turns a deep shiny black if the piece is burnished before firing. Traditional dyes for textiles include those made from the cochineal insect, which produces various shades of red and a marine snail found on the state's coastline for purple. Traditional fibers include cotton (brown and white), wool and maguey. Production techniques are largely unchanged since the pre Hispanic and colonial periods, made in family workshops, with labor often divided by sex, age and social status. A number of artisans and artisan families have gained reputation for fine products and the fine pieces can be found in museums in many parts of the world. There is also innovation in the handcraft markets with artisans adapting designs to suit new markets and even the creation of new items, such as alebrijes . Development Elena Villaseñor Oviedo weaving a double-sided piece on a backstrap loom at the Feria Maestros del Arte Blade in development at the Aguilar workshop in Ocotlán de Morelos The making of good for trade as well as local use was established in the region relatively early in the pre-Hispanic period because the state, especially the Central Valley, was on the trade route that connected central Mexico with Central America. One example of this is the archeological site of El Palmillo, which was a major weaving center, with the weaving of various fibers established by the Classic Period. Then as now, production was centered in households with the households varying in the intensity and type of production. One other common trade good was worked seashells, which the raw material coming from the Oaxacan coast despite the rough terrain, to be worked and then traded here. This tradition of supplementing family income has remained to the present day. The main products have been textiles, ceramics, stone products, baskets and wood products although these have evolved and new products have been introduced. The Spanish, at the beginning of the colonial period, introduced new raw materials, new products and new techniques to diversify the products the region's artisans produced. In the pre-Hispanic period, the main fibers were cotton and ixtle (made from maguey leaves), and the main weaving mechanism was the backstrap loom. The Spanish introduced wool and silk, along with new dyes/colors as well as the pedal loom, which allows faster weaving and the creation of larger pieces. Today Oaxacan weavers produce rugs, handkerchiefs, carrying bags, ponchos, various articles of clothing and more. These changes did not eliminate the older methods. The backstrap loom in still in use, as are dyes made from local plants, animals and minerals such as cochineal, an insect which is used to create red and tishinda, a marine snail used to create purple. The Spanish also introduced glazed ceramics, the filigree method of making gold and silver jewelry and the working of new metals, especially tin and iron. By the 20th century, industrialization had chipped away at the production of handcrafts, especially for local use. For example, by 1965 in San Miguel del Valle, only a few old men still weaved the local wood, using natural dyes because the demand was so low. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the construction of modern roadways, especially the Pan American Highway, allowed the development of a tourist industry, catering to those looking to explore traditional Mexico as well as the coastline. The modern Oaxacan handcraft industry took off, with its initial market being tourists. This led to an interest in traditional methods with the numbers of artisans multiplying, especially in textiles and ceramics from the 1960s to the late 1980s. By the end of this period, a number of communities’ economies had changed from agricultural to those based on one particular handcraft. The 20th century also saw some changes in technique, especially the use of synthetic dyes and paints and commercial thread, as well as lead-free glazes, but these have not completely replaced more traditional production. Jacobo Angeles demonstrates the making of paints with natural pigments in his workshop in San Martín Tilcajete Today, Oaxacan handcrafts are heavily dependent on the tourist trade, including collectors who come to the area especially for handcrafts. This success has also translated into an increase in exports of products to various parts of the world, especially to the United States. The continued development of Oaxacan crafts is supported by both government and private entities. One method of doing this is to encourage younger generations to become craftsmen, with money for equipment and avenues to promote their merchandise such as contests. These efforts also include those outside of Mexico, such as a government-run outlet in Pasadena, California, financing for export by Bancomext and sales by groups such as the Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art . Handcraft traditions continue to evolve in the state, generally to cater to tourist and foreign tastes and include the creation of new products such as alebrijes. The Centro de Diseño Oaxaca has worked to join artisans and contemporary designers to create new products based on traditional techniques and to document the development of handcrafts and folk art in the state. The relationship of crafts to tourism has promoted the opening of a number of museums, generally in the Central Valleys area, to promote and education about the products. These include the Oaxaca Textile Museum (Museo Textile de Oaxaca) founded by the Alfredo Harp Foundation and has a permanent collection of over 1,000 pieces, including some that date from the 17th century. Another example is the state run Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca, which mostly focuses on the barro negro pottery produced in San Bartolo Coyotepec, but contains representative example of all major crafts traditions in the state. Challenges Young artisan adding fine detail to an alebrije Oaxacan artisans are noted for the quality of their work and business success; however, the industry still faces challenges. There is little to no local demand for products because commercially made equivalents are cheaper and often easier to use. This means that artisans are almost completely dependent on tourism to keep traditions alive. The success of Oaxacan crafts has put strains on the availability of raw materials. One example of this is the over-exploitation of copal trees, whose soft wood is preferred by alebrije carvers. Another challenge is the introduction of cheaper imitations of products, generally from China. To date, few Mexican handcraft products have been eligible for certification guaranteeing authenticity. Although the promotion of handcrafts and folk art is a priority in the social and economic development of the state, there is still a lack of government support, often due to bureaucracy. Crafts that have a history in a town that dates back at least to the colonial period is more likely to receive support from government entities. Alebrijes is one exception. The dependency of crafts on the tourism trade means that disruption here has a disproportionate effect on the industry. The 2006 Oaxaca protests severely curtailed tourism to Oaxaca and with it the sales of handcrafts, affecting one of the most vulnerable economic sectors of the state, with sales reduced during the uprising by up to 95% as shops in the historic center were forced to close. This meant that not only vendors in the city were affected but also handcraft producers throughout the Central Valleys who depend on sales in the capital. Political corruption and upheaval, such as the 2006 uprising, have had a negative effect on handcraft sales. The 2006 events hit the artisans hard because as small enterprises, they did not have the resources needed to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Since tourism centers on the city of Oaxaca, with relatively few venturing to the outlying areas where the products are made, many artisans are dependent on middlemen based in the city and often are in debt to them. Wood carving and weaving artisans have formed cooperatives and other organizations to continue to promote their work. However, not all artisans have been able to do this. Because of the difficulty in making a living, many artisans emigrate to the United States. Towns of the Central Valleys Central Valleys Rebozo from Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec Skeletal ceramic piece by Leopoldo Garcia Aguilar of Ocotlan de Morelos Handcraft creation is mostly concentrated in the Central Valleys, the Zapotec region of the state. This area has the highest degree of specialization and variety which includes ceramics, stiff fiber weaving (baskets), textiles of wool and cotton, stone work, wood work, the making of mezcal and leather work. Most crafts-producing communities in the area specialize in one type or sub-type of handcraft and most are located in or near the city of Oaxaca. Merchandise is manufactured for the tourist trade and sold through intermediaries mostly in the city of Oaxaca as relatively few tourists venture into the rural areas where the products are made. Those who do venture outside the capital visit larger producers such as the weaving town of Teotitlan del Valle, and the alebrije carving centers of Arrazola and Tilcajete. As the state center for handcraft distribution, there are numerous outlets including Mercado Benito Juarez, the Casa de las Artesanías de Oaxaca and the Jardín Labastida. Other important regional crafts market in the Central Valleys are the market of Miahuatlán, with stands selling traditional clothing, foods and baskets; the tianguis in Ayoguezco, specializing in furniture and other wood products; and the small market in Etla, specializing in dairy products. Teotitlan and surrounding communities Rug woven by artist/artisan Arnulfo Mendoza in traditional Zapotec design at the Museo de los Pintores Oaxaqueños in the city of Oaxaca The weaving of wool was introduced to Oaxaca in the colonial period, but the specialization of rug making in Teotitlan del Valle and the surrounding communities dates to the development of weaving for the tourist trade. These products are commercialized mainly in Mexico and in fine galleries and other venues in the United States. The rugs are made in family workshops located in homes, with most workshops having three looms. Children learn the craft from a very young age, helping with the process with most having their own loom around age 12 to create small items such as bags and wall hangings. While the yarn used remains 100% wool, much of it is pre-dyed with commercial colorings. The craft has adapted in various ways to international trade in the designs used in the works. Some are called “commercial” as they are popular in markets rather than traditional, although traditional Zapotec designs can still be readily found. While most weavings are rugs, other products created here include blankets, pillows, director's chairs, handbags and wall hangings. Teotitlan is the main producer and marketing center for these wool textiles, making it one of the most prosperous indigenous communities that depends on a handcraft. Tourism to the town began in the 1970s, which gave it its status as an outlet for the even smaller communities around it. The town and surrounding communities still speak Zapotec and marketers have worked to project an image of a single Zapotec community (though the smaller communities tend to produce pieces that show variations). This marketing has led to a class system among the Zapotec in the area, with the middlemen in Teotitlan in tension with producers even before goods reach outside hands. The smaller communities that produce for sale in Teotitlán del Valle include Santa Ana del Valle, San Miguel del Valle and Díaz Ordáz. In these communities as many as half are dedicated full-time to rug weaving. Atzompa and San Bartolo Coyotepec Dolores Porras working in Santa Maria Atzompa Pottery making can be found in many parts of the state, but the two best-known centers are San Bartolo Coyotepec and Santa Maria Atzompa. Most of Oaxaca's pottery is made without potters’ wheels; instead it is produced with molds or formed by hand, sometimes using a kind of “proto-wheel”, which is a plate or shallow bowl place over an inverted bowl. Ceramics are one of Oaxaca's best known handicrafts in Mexico. The most common glazed pieces include those with base colors of brown and white, shaped into vases, plates, cups and decorative pieces. For utilitarian pieces, molds are most commonly used. For very large pieces, such as cantaros and other storage containers, the molding is done in sections. San Bartolo Coyotepec is the home of barro negro (black clay) pottery, the most recognized type from the state. Barro negro is a non-glazed pottery, which gets its shine from burnishing, rubbing the dried piece before firing. It is almost exclusively made in the Coyotepec area. These pieces are also decorative and include lamps, large jars called cantaros, bells, masks, wall decorations and more. To encourage visitors, the town hosts the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca museum and has a Mercado de Artesanias (artisans' market). Atzompa has been making pottery for at least 500 years. It is widely known for its traditional green glazed cookware and ornamental pieces. The glaze for the green pieces was originally lead-based but that was changed in the 1990s due to health concerns. The green glazed ware is mostly formed into utilitarian items such as pots, cazuelas (casserole dishes), jars, bowls and more. More recently, artisans in the town have been experimenting with various other styles of pottery, mostly decorative times in a variety of styles. One of these is called “pastillaje” where very small and fine pieces of clay are formed and pressed onto the main surface of the piece to create decoration. The town also has an outlet for its wares called the Casa de las Artesanias (House of the Artisans). Arrazola and Tilcajete Manuel Jimenez with alebrije Today, wood in Oaxaca is worked into masks and furniture; there is no local market for wood carving, with all production done for sales to tourists and collectors. By far the most popular wood carving is the making of fantastic animal figures called alebrijes. These are mostly made in the towns of San Antonio Arrazola and San Martin Tilcajete, with some notable work done in La Unión Tejalapan . Many buyers of alebrijes assume the works have a longer history in Mexico than they do. They were created in the 20th century, with the concept conceived by Mexico City cartonería maker Pedro Linares, who Oaxaca lore states emigrated from Arrazola to the capital. The Oaxaca version of alebrijes differ not only by being smaller and carved from wood, but the figures generally are more recognizable as a single animal such as lions, jaguars, iguanas, dragons, dogs, snakes, rather than an amalgam of various animal parts. The reason for this is that there is a long Zapotec tradition of the carving of wooden figures. The first to develop Oaxaca alebrijes was Manuel Jiménez Ramírez of Arrazola, who created them for over thirty years before his death, using soft copal wood which is still preferred. He then painted them in bright colors and with intricate designs. He was followed by Santos Pinos and then the craft spread to others in the town. It was similar in San Martín Tilcajete, where a few pioneering families started the trend there. The two towns originally began selling to tourists but eventually the pieces became collectors’ items that are now sold in shops and galleries in the US and other countries. Santo Tomás Jalietza The town of Santo Tomás Jalieza specializes in cotton textiles, embroidered items and those woven with a backstrap loom such as blouses, sarapes (shawls), other traditional clothing and tablecloths. It has been known for its backstrap loom works for at least 400 years, with most of its production in the colonial period sold locally, especially to communities in the Sierra de Villa Alta. Since the early 20th century the producers in Jalieza have organized to produce and market their wares. The number of craftspeople in Jalieza has increased since the 1940s, and especially since the 1960s when the paving of the highway through the municipality brought tourism. The demand for the textiles by the 1970s was great enough that even men began to participate in what is traditionally women's work, but only inside the home and in private. However, the most successful textiles produced by the community are not the most traditional; instead they are pieces which have been modified to be more attractive to outside markets. Today the quantity and quality of pieces is regulated and promoted collectively, mostly through the Unión de Artesanos. It works to introduce new designs, create new markets and fix prices for merchandise. Then the market was completed in 1970, sales of textiles concentrated there. Many families have specialized in certain garments or other pieces. Basket making communities Craftswoman making banana leaf bun in Tavehua, Oaxaca. Not all crafts are internationally known or collected. One such is the weaving of baskets. This craft is mostly practiced in very small communities in the Central Valleys region, where reeds grow abundantly along riverbanks. In addition to traditional baskets for carrying, the reeds are also fashioned into bird cages, lamps, candy dishes and screens/curtains. Towns best known for this activity include Etla, Ocotlán de Morelos, Tlacolula, Santa Cruz Papalutla, Santa Ana del Valle, Villa Diaz Ordaz and San Miguel del Valle. As these areas are not generally visited by tourists, the main outlets for baskets is the Centro de Abastos (wholesale food market) in the city of Oaxaca and the Sunday tianguis in Tlacolula. This craft has not been promoted by governmental and other entities, as other crafts have been, and which is crucial to creating a wider market and to adapting the craft to modern tastes. For this reason, and the fact that the local market is dwindling, the craft is in decline. One reason for the non-support of basket making is that the product is associated with rural areas rather than modern urban ones. Octolán de Morelos One exception to the specialization to one type of handcraft is the town of Octolán de Morelos, location south of the city of Oaxaca. The best known of the town's handcrafts is its pottery, the making of which is dominated by women. The best known potters are the Aguilar family, dominated by sisters Josefina, Guillermina, Irene and Concepción who create fanciful multicolored figurines. Ocotlán is noted for its production of hand-crafted knives and other blades. Apolinar Aguilar Velasco is one of the best-known for making knives, swords, machetes and the like using the same techniques as those used in the 16th century. Aguilar began making blades when he was ten, taught by his father and uncle. He is now teaching the craft to the next generation. Tlacolula de Matamoros Tlacolula is a small city east of the state capital. It is also known for various cottage industries especially the production of mezcal and wrought iron, but also for some textiles. While mezcal is produced all over Oaxaca, Tlacolula is considered the center of production. The beverage is made from various types of maguey plant such as tobalá, espadín and arroquense, either found wild or cultivated. The drink comes in a number of varieties, depending on the maguey used, the roasting and fermentation processes used and the aging. Although not all types use it, the “worm” in the bottle (really a larva) is associated with mezcal, not tequila. Mezcal is bottled straight or combined with flavorings to create cream style liquors. Metal is also worked in the city, especially tin and iron, which were introduced by the Spanish. Tin in worked in mostly decorative items such as mirror frames and figures. Iron is worked into knives, daggers and other blades, machetes, tableware. Tlacolula is particularly noted for its production of wrought iron railings for buildings. Other communities There is not much production of handcrafts in the city of Oaxaca itself. One exception to this is the working of sheet metal, which was established in the colonial period. The metal is mostly used for the making of candle holders and frames for windows and mirrors, along with fantasy figures and Christmas decorations. The Xochimilco neighborhood of the city is known for the production of tablecloths, napkins and other such linens. In Valle de Etla, one group of indigenous residents has taken to collecting old tires found on the highway and have begun converting them into handcrafts. The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used them to support washers and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he found a way to convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for their gardens. Since then he and others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income. The town of San Juan Teitipac makes stone products, but two of their traditional product, mutates and molcajetes, have mostly been replaced by blenders and mixers. Other parts of the state Huipils and blouses from Juchitán There are artisans in other parts of the state, although they are not as well known. The state has a wide variety of textile traditions, with many communities having distinctive styles of dress and designs. The Chinateca region in the north of the state is known for its unique huipil designs, made by the local Chinanteca and Mazatec peoples. Each town has its own variations and there are three types of huipils, those for everyday use, semi formal and formal. Wrought iron and other metal work is found in the towns of Tlaxiaco in the west and Santa Catarina Juquila and Santiago Jamiltepec in the southwest of the state, generally practical items such as knives. The last is known for a local style of machete . The Tehuantepec area produces an orange-colored pottery, which is highly resistant to breakage and generally used for tile, flowerpots and other heavy duty items. For decorative items, pastillaje is also use to add flowers and other foliage and may be fired a second time to affix coloring. In Juchitan, wares include traditional local dress for men and women, clay dolls and masks, key chains, local candies and mezcal. Most Juchitan artisans must rely on intermediaries to get products to market. However, over fifty workshops in the Juchitan area has banded into a cooperative to promote their products, especially in May when the city hold its regional fair which attracts many visitors. The group also works to have products available at other events in the state, especially during the main tourist seasons. Gold and silver jewelry is produced in the Tehuantepec area, both through the filigree method introduced by the Spanish as well as hand- hammered pieces. One local variety of jewelry is made from antique gold coins. Filigree and hammered pieces are also produced in Huajuapan de León, often reproductions of jewelry found in Monte Albán and other archeological sites. The weaving of palm fronds is most commonly done in the tropical Mixtec region of the state in the west and includes hats, mats, flower vases and small purses. The most noted community for this work is Tlaxiaco, which also makes fine textiles and linens. Most leatherwork can be found in Ejutla de Crespo and Jalatlaco, whose products are exported to other countries. Notable pieces include scabbards for machetes, saddles, wallets, belts, portfolios and more. The leather is made from the skins of local animals. Leather pieces such as belts and bags can be found embroidered with ixtle fiber, which is extracted from maguey leaves. Coffee is grown and processed in the mountain areas near the coast, especially in the municipalities of Santa María Huatulco, Pluma Hidalgo, Candelaria Loxicha, San Miguel del Puerto, San Mateo Piñas, Santiago Xanica, and San Pedro Pochutla. This tradition dates from the 17th century when the coffee plant was introduced by English pirates, later developed in the 20th century by German immigrants.

They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 February 2002.  History  The two mature Hoop Pines situated in front of the Administration Building of St Paul's Anglican School, Bald Hills, are believed to mark the location of the original Stewart Farmhouse at Bald Hills. The Stewart family, along with their relatives the Duncans, were the earliest non-indigenous settlers in the Bald Hills area (known to Aboriginal people as Wyampa) and later established one of the district's most successful dairy farms. The taller of the Hoop Pines may be remnant old growth vegetation, approximately 190 years old. The smaller Hoop Pine may be approximately 140 years old - either planted or a seedling from the older tree. The prevalence of valuable logging trees such as hoop and bunya pines and red cedar was one of the principal attractions for the establishment of a penal settlement at Moreton Bay in the 1820s. Historian JD Steele suggests that \\"Brisbane owes its foundations to Oxley's enthusiasm for its river and its indigenous pine tree, Araucaria cunninghamii, usually known as the hoop pine. The tree was first observed by Oxley on 1 December 1823, on the banks of the Pine River near Petrie . . .\\".JD Steele The Explorers of the Moreton Bay District 1770-1830 1972:90 Within 50 years, most of the hoop pine had been extracted from the Moreton Bay region. The establishment of Bald Hills as a farming community in the late 1850s was closely linked to the move by Scottish squatters John and David McConnel of Durundur on the Upper Stanley River (south of the Conondale Range and west of the Glass House Mountains), and their pro-Brisbane, pro-John Dunmore Lang associates, to establish a port at Cabbage Tree Creek, Sandgate in the 1850s. The move was given impetus with the reinstatement of the northern passage to Moreton Bay, around the northern end of Moreton Island and south past Redcliffe and Cabbage Tree Creek, as the principal shipping passage in 1848, following the wreck of the Sovereign in the South Passage in March 1847. In the early 1850s the McConnels and their associates, who supported John Dunmore Lang's vision of the development of a \\"cotton colony\\" north of Brisbane between Cabbage Tree Creek and South Pine River, lobbied for the establishment of a port at Cabbage Tree Creek, which they claimed was more convenient for shipping than the Brisbane River, offered safe berths for larger vessels, and in particular, would give more direct port access to the Stanley River squatters, who could travel via North Pine through Bald Hills to Cabbage Tree Creek. The McConnels were joined by a number of prominent Brisbane businessmen, including John Richardson, Thomas Dowse, Robert Davidson and George Raff, who in 1852 called for a port to rival Cleveland, and the development of a resort suburb, at Bramble Bay. The New South Wales government had already set aside a village reserve at the head of Cabbage Tree Creek, and now the Scottish connection was pushing for its survey and the survey of a road from Brisbane. The village was surveyed in 1852 and in November 1853 the first Sandgate town lots were offered at public auction. There was much interest, and high prices were obtained, with the McConnels, Dowse and Robert Davidson purchasing heavily. Sandgate never did develop as a port, development being retarded by government decisions, the inaction of early speculative landowners, poor communication with Brisbane, and strong Aboriginal resistance to European settlement. However, the lobby group did not give up hope through the 1850s, and the enticement of agricultural settlers to the Bald Hills area behind Sandgate in the mid-1850s may have been connected with move to develop a port at Cabbage Tree Creek. The link is Thomas Gray, who was responsible for encouraging the Stewart and Duncan families to take up land at Bald Hills, and who was connected with the McConnels; and the fact that both he and WJ Loudon, who had invested heavily at the first sale of Sandgate allotments, both purchased allotments at the first sale of Bald Hills land. Thomas Gray, a Brisbane bootmaker, had emigrated to New South Wales in 1841/42 from the Black Isle, Scotland, to work for fellow highlanders the McConnels at Moreton Bay. During the voyage Gray befriended fellow Scots John Stewart and his sisters Jessie (Janet) and Margaret, and the Duncan brothers and their families. In 1845 Gray married Janet Stewart and John Stewart married the Duncan's sister, Jane. Stewart and the Duncans eventually settled on the Hunter River, while Gray established a bootmaking business in Brisbane in 1844. In the mid-1850s Gray convinced the Stewarts and Duncans to leave the flood-stricken Hunter River district and move to the South Pine River north of Brisbane, to the area now known as Bald Hills. Stewart made a preliminary trip to the district to select suitable land, not just for himself and the Duncans, but also for a large number of Hunter River settlers who were equally interested. Stewart immediately applied to the New South Wales survey office to have the land surveyed, but it was not proclaimed available for sale until December 1856, with Stewart finally purchasing land in February 1857. Due to the delay in survey, most of the interested Hunter River settlers meanwhile had moved to the Clarence River where new land was available. Only Stewart and the Duncans and their families from the Hunter took up land at Bald Hills, moving onto their selections in early October 1857. They are generally acknowledged as the first non-indigenous settlers at Bald Hills. After their experiences on the Hunter River, the settlers selected the higher ground for their farms, erecting their first houses (apparently slab and bark) on the low ridge above the South Pine River where St Peter's Anglican School is now situated. Fearing attack from Aborigines, their houses were loop-holed for rifles and located within sight of each other. These precautions proved unnecessary, for at the request of Thomas Gray and other settlers in the area between Cabbage Tree Creek and Caboolture, a detachment of Native Police was stationed at Sandgate from 1858 to 1862. Under the command of Lieutenant Frederick Wheeler, the Native Police eliminated Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in the Pine Rivers, Cabbage Tree Creek and Caboolture districts by the early 1860s. The Stewart and Duncan families cleared the gentle slopes along the South Pine River for their crops. By the end of the 1860s most of the valuable stands of red cedar and hoop pine in the Bald Hills district had been removed, although much scrub remained. Through the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s maize, potatoes and some oaten and wheaten hay were the principal cash crops, and John Stewart had early experimented with arrowroot and cotton, for which he won bronze and silver medals at the London International Exhibition of 1862. Following the opening of a railway to Bald Hills in 1888, dairying became the principal economic activity in the district. By 1929, dairy farmers at Bald Hills were supplying up to of milk daily to Brisbane and Sandgate. John Stewart and his family were well respected in the Bald Hills community and active members of the local Presbyterian church, John serving as an Elder for nearly 40 years. The earliest Presbyterian services in the Bald Hills district were conducted at the Stewart home until a small slab and shingled church was erected in 1863 at the corner of the Strathpine and Bald Hills roads. In 1889 the slab church was replaced by a milled-timber building erected on land donated by John Stewart in 1887, further west along Strathpine Road. (This building was destroyed by fire in 1909, and replaced with the present building in 1911.) Two of Stewart's sons, James and Charles, became Presbyterian ministers. Rev. James Stewart was the founder of the Brisbane City Mission. Many local events also were celebrated at the Stewart home, including the opening of the bridge over the South Pine River in May 1865, when a ball was held in the Stewart barn. In 1890, John Stewart took out a mortgage from the Brisbane Permanent Building and Banking Company Ltd, which may have financed construction of a new residence. If he did, the Stewarts occupied their new house for only a few years, for in 1895 the main portion of the farm - nearly , including what is understood to be the site of the Stewart family's first residence and the possibly house - was transferred to William Thomas Taylor. The remaining Stewart property was developed as the Woodlawn dairy farm, managed by Alexander Caldwell Stewart until his accidental death in 1900. The Woodlawn Farmhouse survives at 15 Listowel Street, Bald Hills. Jane Stewart died in 1898, and her husband John in 1905, but at least one son continued to dairy farm at Bald Hills for many years. Taylor held the original Stewart property for only a few years, transferring it in February 1898 to Samuel Unwin of Eagle Farm, who in November 1905 took out a mortgage on the property. The residence located on this property and which now functions as the Administration Building at St Paul's Anglican School, appears to date to the 1890s or very early 1900s, but it has not been established whether it was erected by Stewart or a later owner. A photograph dated 1906 shows the house prior to additions and verandah enclosures, with the two already mature hoop pines forming a natural frame to the front entrance. From this evidence it is clear that the trees were not late 19th or early 20th century plantings, and it would have been unusual for them to have survived to the 20th century, were they not incorporated within the earlier Stewart house garden. The property continued to be worked as a dairy farm, changing hands again in 1907 and also in 1910. In 1921 it was acquired by William John Hawkins of Bald Hills, who was a leader in Queensland dairying, credited with being instrumental in the establishment of the first milk supply cold store in Brisbane, at the Roma Street railway station, . In 1929 a Brisbane newspaper described WJ Hawkins as \\"a successful settler, possessing a fine property and picturesque homestead\\".Brisbane Courier 14 December 1929 Further ownership changes were registered in 1934/35 and 1940, then in 1954 the property passed to John Joseph Murray Redmond and Dorothy Eliza Redmond. It was the Redmonds who transferred the land to the Anglican Church in 1958, to develop as a boys' Church of England School, thus ending over a century of agricultural activity on this land. Bald Hills remained predominantly a farming community until the second half of the 20th century, when many of the early farms were subdivided for residential settlement. Few 19th century farmhouses have survived, and of those which remain most have been substantially altered. The former farmhouse which is now used as the Administration Building of St Paul's Anglican School, is a rare surviving late 19th/early 20th century farmhouse in the Bald Hills district, and its site is associated with the earliest phase of non-indigenous settlement in the district. A tangible link with the early farm remains in the unsubdivided school grounds and its two early hoop pines.  Description  The two Hoop Pines (Araucaria cunninghamii) are located within the grounds of St Paul's Anglican School, Strathpine Road, Bald Hills. They are situated at the end of the school's main driveway, framing the entrance to the school's Administration Building, which is a late 19th/early 20th century former farmhouse. The older tree is approximately high with a canopy diameter of approximately . The younger tree is approximately high with a canopy diameter of approximately . Both trees have lost the upper trunk and canopy as a result of storm damage in the mid-1980s.  Heritage listing  Hoop Pines was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 February 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Hoop Pines at St Paul's Anglican School, Bald Hills are indicative of the pattern of Queensland settlement, being associated with the evolution of non-indigenous settlement in the Moreton Bay district in the 1850s, and with the earliest development of the Bald Hills district in particular The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The larger of the two Hoop Pines is likely to pre-date non-indigenous settlement, and as remnant forest growth is rare surviving evidence of the valuable stands of Hoop Pine which made the Moreton Bay district so attractive for early colonial settlement, and which had been virtually removed from the Bald Hills district by the late 1860s. The two early Hoop Pines at St Paul's Anglican School are of horticultural interest and are rare specimens of trees of this age surviving in the Brisbane area. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Hoop Pines have aesthetic significance for their landmark value on the ridge at Bald Hills. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. They also have a special association for the community of Bald Hills as evidence of the work of the Stewart family, who, together with their relatives the Duncans, were the first non-indigenous settlers in the area, and were instrumental in developing Bald Hills as an agricultural district supplying Brisbane and Sandgate; and for the community of St Paul's Anglican School as marking the administrative centre of the school.

Gambier is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia where it was an important trade item into the late nineteenth century. It can be used as a tanning agent, a brown dye, a food additive and as herbal medicine. Also known as pale catechu, white catechu or Japan Earth, it is often confused with other forms of catechu. History Chinese workers in a gambier and pepper plantation in Singapore, circa 1900. Gambier production began as a traditional occupation in the Malay archipelago. By the middle of the seventeenth century, it was established in Sumatra and in the western parts of Java and the Malay peninsula. It was initially used as medicine and chewed with betel. Local Chinese also began to use gambier to tan hides. Chinese first got involved in gambier production at Riau, using coolie labor and growing black pepper as a supplemental crop. Bugis merchants traded the gambier for rice from Java and Siam, helping the Bugis to become an important regional power in the late eighteenth century. When the British settlement of Singapore was founded in 1819, about 20 gambier plantations had already been started in the area by Chinese. The peak of Singapore's gambier trade was in the 1830s through 1850s, driven by demand from the British dyeing and leather tanning industries. Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that upon his visit to China in the 1830s, Chinese were using it for tanning, and noted that the uncaria gambir made \\"leather porous and rotten\\". He also noted that the Chinese would chew it with areca nut. In the 1860s through 1880s, gambier production was expanded in nearby Johor under the kangchu system. Production To make gambier, the leaves are first boiled in water. They absorb it and turn brownish in color. The leaves are then pressed mechanically to squeeze and extract liquid. This liquid is then dried into a semi-solid paste and molded into cubes, which are dried in the sun. Physical properties and composition Gambier has a highly astringent taste with no odor, ranging in color from yellow to brown. It is mainly composed of cattechu-tanic acid (a tannin) and catechin (a flavan-3-ol). Commercially produced gambier may range in catechin content of less than 20% to more than 40% depending on quality. When used for making leather, catechin is converted into cattechu-tanic acid by the tanning process. Trace components include quercetin, wax, oil, cattechu red, and gambier-flourescien. Gambier extracts further contain chalcane-flavan dimers (gambiriins A1, A2, B1 and B2) in addition to (+)-catechin, (+)-epicatechin, and dimeric proanthocyanidins including procyanidin B1, procyanidin B3, and gambiriin C. Uses Gambier has been used as a form of catechu for chewing with areca nut. Particularly in the nineteenth century, it was economically important as a brown dye and tanning agent. It is still used as herbal medicine, and occasionally as a food additive.

Jones (born July 10, 1949), is a businessman and civic leader who served from 1984 to 1989 as the thirteenth mayor of his native Bossier City in northwestern Louisiana. Earlier, he was the national president of the Junior Chamber International. Background Jones was born in Shreveport\\"Louisiana: Don E. Jones\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008 (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2007), p. 662 but reared in Bossier City. He graduated in 1967 from Bossier High School in Bossier City and is a 2012 inductee of the Bossier High School Hall of Fame. In 1971, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in business management from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He was affiliated with Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Thereafter, he joined the family-owned Jones Brothers Company, Inc., a general contractor based in Bossier City. He rose to the rank of vice-president of the company and then the president. He and his brother, Bill J. Jones (born 1953), remain the principals of the company, begun in 1953 by their father, William D. Jones (born 1925), and their uncle, Fred S. Jones (1913-1988), a former Bossier City public works commissioner under the former city commission government. The company originally installed underground storage tanks and piping and is certified by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Jones Brothers also installs fueling systems in four states in such businesses as bulk plants, convenience stores, and aviation facilities. Jones Brothers also has offices in Scott near Lafayette and Farmerville near Monroe. Since 1987, Jones has been vice president and secretary of Jones Environmental, Inc., based in a restored historic building at 708 Milam Street in Shreveport, with offices in Scott, Farmerville, and Van Buren, Arkansas. This company specializes in mold and asbestos abatement. Since 1991, he has been the treasurer of Environmental Gulf States Laboratory, Inc., also based in Bossier City. He is also an owner of Navarre Services Group, Inc. Jones is a member of the Baptist denomination; his maternal grandfather, Joseph E. Hinkie (1889-1977), was a Baptist pastor from Sabine Parish in western Louisiana. Jones is married to the former Gay Lynn Marchand (born September 1949), the daughter of the late Alexander Joseph Marchand, Jr., and the former Hallette Harlan (1919-2014), a Roman Catholic couple from Alexandria, Louisiana. Don and Gay Jones have two sons, Thomas Edward Jones (born November 1975) and Jacob Marchand Jones (born December 1978). Political life Jones's involvement in politics began when he was a delegate to a Democratic State Convention in Louisiana. In his first race for office in 1984, Jones won a hotly contested special election to fill the months remaining in the second term of Mayor Marvin Anding, a former commander of Barksdale Air Force Base, who had died in office in September 1983. Patricia Janelle Ball Anding (1935-2012), the widow of Mayor Anding, was Jones's opponent. The interim mayor, Democrat Frank Blackburn, had won a special election on March 15, 1980, over the Republican David Harold Broussard (1947-1998) to fill the at-large seat on the city council created by the election of Robert Adley to the Louisiana House of Representatives.Shreveport Journal, March 17, 1980, p. 2 On March 28, 1984, a mayoral debate appearance at a Bossier City hotel led thereafter to the filing of a defamation suit between two partisans of Anding and Jones. Bobby Garrett (born 1943), a Jones campaigner and the director of a local Community Action program, sued Anding backer Roger Kneass (born 1938) regarding remarks made during and after the debate. Kneass asked Jones about reports that he intended to select Garrett for various municipal offices. Garrett was outraged over the implications of Kneass's questioning. After the debate, with the reporters having exited the meeting and the crowd having mostly dissipated, Garrett walked up to Kneass and made remarks that became the subject of dispute. Kneass interpreted Garrett's comments as a threat to Kneass's family; others at the scene said that they heard no such implication. Garrett sued Kneass for having allegedly called Garrett \\"a thug\\". Kneass sent a letter to Jones, the United States Attorney General Ed Meese, and the FBI to complain of threats to Kneass's family. Reports of the threats against Keneass were repeated by Mrs. Anding to the since defunct Shreveport Journal, Shreveport Times, and KSLA-TV. Garrett sued and sought damages of $150,000 for humiliation, embarrassment, and loss of future income. The court held in Garrett's favor but awarded him only $2,500 based on mitigating factors as to whether the word \\"thug\\" alone is defamation. Jones also said that he would not hire Garrett in any \\"directory level\\" position. In 1985, Mayor Jones moved to demote Bossier City Police Chief Bobby Ray Gauthier (1944-1988) to the rank of patrolman because of actions taken more than two years earlier during the Anding administration. Gauthier was accused of having conspired in 1983 to influence the physical examination of B. W. Spencer to prevent Spencer's promotion to the rank of police lieutenant. Gauthier sued for reinstatement as chief, but the court ruled in favor of the city. Judge Graydon K. Kitchens, Jr., said that Jones acted in \\"good faith\\" when he removed Gauthier from the post. In 1987, Mayor Jones ran unsuccessfully for the District 9 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives. With 49.96 percent of the votes cast, he came within six ballots of winning the position outright. However, he was placed into a runoff election with his fellow Democrat, Billy Montgomery, a teacher and coach from Bossier Parish, who later switched to Republican affiliation. In the showdown, Montgomery polled 4,998 votes (53.5 percent); Jones, 4,343 (46.5 percent). Mayor Jones sought to expand business development and investment into the Shreveport-Bossier City area, particularly after job reductions were announced in 1987 by AT&T.; Prior to the downsizing by AT&T;, Jones said that area officials had \\"thought of ourselves as a sleepy southern town with cheap labor to offer corporations from the North, but we realized that we couldn't keep competing in the global economy on that basis any longer. We'd never be able to match the wage levels of Third-World nations, so it was time to see if there was any other way for this area to survive.\\" Jones did not seek a second full term as mayor in 1989 and was succeeded by the Democrat George Dement. Like most area political figures, Jones, even as a former mayor, is a long- term supporter of Barksdale Air Force Base. The Bossier City base is seeking to attract the \\"Common Battlefield Airmen Training\\" program to prepare troops for ready fighting on the ground. Jones said that for Barksdale to attract a program of this scope would have a decisive \\"economic impact throughout the entire community.\\" A member of the civic group Barksdale Forward and the 8th Air Force Consultation Committee, Jones pushed in 2009 for development of the Air Force Cyber Command at Barksdale. However, the selection went to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Jaycees national president Prior to his tenure as mayor, Jones was from 1979 to 1980 the Louisiana state vice president for membership and from 1980 to 1981 the state president of the Junior Chamber International, popularly known as the Jaycees. In June 1982, he was chosen at the national convention in Phoenix, Arizona, as the national Junior Chamber president. His selection came on the 42nd ballot after 40 hours of politicking.\\"Don E. Jones\\" profile, Future magazine, July/August 1982 For this assignment as national Jaycee president, Jones, his wife, who was active in the Jaycee Jaynes, and their sons spent the year 1982 to 1983 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They were the last family to live in the former Jaycee \\"White House\\" in south Tulsa and the first in the \\"Founders Home,\\" having moved early in 1983 to the residence a block from War Memorial Headquarters. This property remains the home for the Jaycee president and his family during the one-year presidential term. As the Jaycee president, Jones traveled through twenty-four states in a bus labeled \\"U. S. Jaycees Touring America\\", which received considerable media coverage. Though the Jaycees lost 4,300 members during Jones's tenure as president, the year ended with six consecutive months of growth. As Jones stepped down, the organization had nearly 272,000 members in about 7,000 chapters. During this time the Jaycees continued to exclude women from membership, a policy changed a year later in 1984 with relatively little opposition in the wake of an opinion by the United States Supreme Court which declared the organization to be a public accommodation. Jones was thereafter the JCI national treasurer in 1984. He viewed the organization as representing \\"improvement of the quality of life in America and the continuance of the free enterprise system. ... If we are to continue to remain a free country, it is going to take the efforts of each and every one of us as volunteers ...\\" On November 22, 1982, Bossier City proclaimed \\"Don E. Jones Day\\" because of his leadership over the Jaycees. While he was the Jaycee president, Jones maintained an official Bossier City residence and was qualified to run for mayor. An opponent, James Quillen Wellborn (1927-2004), a native of Daingerfield, Texas, a mathematics teacher at Bossier High School and a former chairman of the Bossier Parish Republican Party, failed to have Jones disqualified from the ballot on the grounds that Jones had not met the residency requirement for municipal office in Bossier City because he had spent part of the preceding year in Tulsa. Instead the Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Shreveport upheld Jones's validation as a legal resident of Bossier City. Civic activities Jones has long been active in Ducks Unlimited and the Boy Scouts of America. In 2001, he was named a laureate of the organization Junior Achievement. He was a contributor to the restoration of the Strand Theatre in downtown Shreveport. That same year, The Shreveport Times named Jones, along with current State Senator Rick Gallot, one of eleven regional \\"Outstanding Leaders\\". Jones is a past chairman and a current member of the board of directors of the Biomedical Research Foundation, which oversees the operation of former Louisiana State University public hospitals, the LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, renamed University Health in 2013, and the E.A. Conway Medical Center in Monroe. In 2013, he was among thirteen BRF directors selected from a list of fifty nominees. Jones is a board member of the Community Foundation of North Louisiana, which in 2011 displayed an initiative known as the \\"Science of Generosity\\" exhibit in Shreveport-Bossier City. Created in 2009 through the University of Notre Dame and the John Templeton Foundation, the initiative encourages philanthropy and demonstrates how recipients and givers both benefit. In 2011, the Community Foundation awarded more than $1 million in scholarships and grants in Bossier Parish. In 2008, Jones received from the United Way of Northwest Louisiana the Clyde E. Fant Memorial Award for Outstanding Community Service, named for the late Mayor Clyde Fant of Shreveport. He was cited as a \\"bridge builder\\" willing to work behind the scenes for the good of Shreveport and Bossier City. Jones was a regular contributor in her early campaigns to former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. He also financially supported former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Senators John Breaux of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. In 2011, Jones and his son, Jacob, each gave $1,000 to the Republican Jeff R. Thompson of Bossier City in Thompson's successful campaign for the Louisiana House of Representatives. Thompson in 2015 became a judge of the 9th Judicial District Court in Benton in Bossier Parish.

The film stars John Abraham, Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez alongside Akshaye Khanna as the antagonist, marking his comeback to acting after a four-year break. Dishoom released worldwide on 29 July 2016. It was commercially successful at the box office, earning more than 150 crs. worldwide.  Plot  During a cricket tournament in the Middle East, 48 hours prior to the final match between India and Pakistan, India's top cricketer Viraj Sharma (Saqib Saleem) goes missing. Indian authorities get a video tape of an unknown man claiming to have abducted Viraj till the India vs Pakistan cricket match two days later and warning them not to cancel the match. Attempting to avoid media outrage, Gayatri Shubha Mishra (Mona Ambegaonkar), the External Affairs Minister of India, sends special task force officer Kabir Shergill IPS (John Abraham) to U.A.E for a 36-hour manhunt. After being received by and getting into a semi-scuffle with a local officer, Saeed Naqvi (Tarun Khanna), Kabir, who is a no-nonsense cop, bumps into a rookie Indo-Emirati police officer Junaid Ansari (Varun Dhawan), who has never been able to solve a case but has a good knowledge of the town which he acquired during his first incomplete case of finding a dog named Bradman. Both Kabir and Junaid start their investigation with a CCTV footage of Viraj's hotel and find out that on the night of his disappearance, Viraj went out with a local girl, Samira Dalal (Nargis Fakhri). On confronting her, she reveals that she took Viraj to a friend's birthday party but he left soon. Kabir and Junaid roam around the town to meet a local goon nicknamed Khabri Chacha (Vijay Raaz) who directs them to Sameer Gazi (Akshay Kumar), the city's biggest party animal who met Viraj in the same party, but still could not get any clue. Finally, the duo gets a breakthrough by tracking down Viraj's cellphone from the apartment of a pick-pocketer, Ishika (Jacqueline Fernandez) who claims to have stolen the cell phone from a stranger, the previous night, in a supermarket. They also manage to capture the person in the video, but discover that he is just a struggling actor being used as the face in the video by the real kidnapper. However, Junaid is shocked when the actor recognizes the \\"stranger\\" Ishika had mentioned as the fugitive who conducted his audition, and rubs a sketch clue of evidence right out to Kabir, who asks Saeed, Junaid's superior, to identify the stranger. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the real kidnapper is a cricket bookie Wagah (Akshaye Khanna), who along with his assistant Altaf (Rahul Dev), the stranger, has abducted Viraj and offered him 300 million rupees to under play in the final. They finally close the deal for 500 million. But when the deal didn't work out and Viraj closeted onto them, bluffing an imposterly Wagah into believing he would underplay, they kidnap him permanently till the final match is played. In the current time Kabir, a suspended-from-duty Junaid and Ishika go to an underground Arabian club in Altaf's native state Abuddin, full of goons and guns, where Ishika helps Kabir and Junaid by distracting the goons and later Kabir rescues her from them. During the journey, Junaid reveals to Ishika that Kabir suffered from cancer and was cheated by his girlfriend for the same and has lost his smile ever since. Hearing this Ishika warms up to Kabir, clicking and sending photos of both together while he is still asleep, to his recently turned ex-girlfriend Alishka, with whom he had a breakup. Kabir spots Altaf and both try to chase him down but before they could succeed, a sniper kills Altaf. Wagah calls and confesses to Kabir that he got him killed and they should stop searching for Viraj. Wagah confronts Viraj, threatens to kill his family, shoots both a Mumbai-based partner and his own manager, and asks his wife to leave with their son, finally stranded, with only Bradman by his side. On returning to Abu Dhabi, Kabir and Junaid are taken off the case and Kabir ordered to fly back to India. Seeing Kabir walk towards the airport , Ishika goes soft and confesses her feelings for Kabir to Junaid .At the 11th hour Junaid gets a clue of Viraj's whereabout through a camera on Bradman's neck, as Wagah has hidden him in a yacht near the team's hotel. Both reach the location only to discover that Wagah has fled leaving behind Viraj tied with a time bomb after Wagah realised that Bradman, who is apparently his pet, carried over his neck a GPS tracker band Junaid tied out to never lose track of Bradman. With minutes to blast Kabir negotiates with Wagah to stop the bomb in return of 5 billion rupees from Indian Government. Wagah takes the money but refuses to stop the bomb. After witnessing the blast from a distance Wagah walks into the cricket stadium expecting the match to begin without Viraj. But to his shock Viraj is alive and walks into the ground all ready to play as a parallel flashback reveals Kabir and Junaid helped Viraj to get out of the jacket by dislocating his shoulder and all three had jumped into water just before the blast. After seeing his plan failed, Wagah tries to run away only to be apprehended by the duo. Kabir, who now has feelings for Ishika, returns to India along with her, while Junaid, who regains his duty, gets a marriage proposal from an Indian girl, Muskaan (Parineeti Chopra) and he also plans to fly to India to meet her.

Polish battalions were commanded by Captain Mieczyslaw Rys-Trojanowski and Captain Ottokar Brzoza-Brzezina. On November 17, 4th and 6th Battalions, supported by field artillery, took positions on the hill of Holy Cross, located between Krzywoploty and Bydlin.

Polish losses were heavy, with 46 killed and 131 either wounded or captured. All victims, Polish, Austrian and Russian, were buried in a cemetery at Bydlin. Jozef Pilsudski called the battle “our Thermopylae”, and following his initiative, a monument in the shape of a stone cross was unveiled at the Bydlin Cemetery in 1920.

The battle took place near Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand, Marne department, northeastern France. After dissolution of the so-called Bayonne Legion (Legion Bajończyków), which existed in 1914–1915, no other ethnic Polish unit was created within the French Army. French authorities were well aware of the position of the Russian Empire, which strongly opposed any kind of Polish independence movement. The situation changed after the February Revolution of 1917, when Western Powers realized that Russia was no longer a major player in the conflict. Due to efforts of Polish organizations in France, such as Committee of Polish Volunteers and Polish National Committee (1917–19), on June 4, 1917, French President Raymond Poincaré signed a decree, in which he created Polish Army in France. On January 10, 1918, 1st Polish Rifles Regiment began training of volunteers, many of whom came from Polish immigrants to the United States, Brazil and other countries. In June 1918, 1st Polish Rifle Division was created, and by July, this unit had 10,000 soldiers, commanded by General Józef Haller, who had come to France from Russia. In July and August 1918, Polish regiments were sent to different sectors of the front in the Vosges Mountains and Champagne. 1st Chevau-leger Regiment, together with sappers, was sent to the area of Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand. On July 5, Poles attacked German positions there, capturing 120 prisoners, together with 12 heavy machine guns. Soon after the battle, three Polish Chevau-leger regiments were merged into 1st Rifle Division, and the united force guarded the French-German frontline from Rambervillers to Raon-l'Étape. In November 1918, the Division was tasked with capturing Saarbrücken, but after the Armistice of 11 November 1918, it was not necessary any longer. In April and May 1919, all units of the Blue Army were sent to Poland, where they participated in the Polish–Soviet War and the Polish–Ukrainian War.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The house gives its name to the former suburb of Rainworth (now a locality within Bardon).  History  Early view of Rainworth homestead and outbuildings, circa 1875 Sir Augustus Charles Gregory KCMG CMG FRGS MLC, famed explorer, and surveyor-general of Queensland from 1859 to 1879, built and lived in Rainworth House from 1862 until his death in 1905. He reputedly constructed the dwelling himself. Gregory was a dominant, conservative Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Sir Augustus Gregory He was also a vital personality in Toowong Town Council, a leading Queensland freemason and an influential amateur scientist. Rainworth House was his rural retreat, his homestead, the place where he could think, invent, create and write. Unlike Gregory, the subsequent owner, Robert Philp, merchant and politician, rented the property, as did ensuing owners. Subdivision of Gregory's country estate necessitated shifting the house to a more accommodating position. In 1949 it was rented and later purchased by Frederick and Mildred Howell, whose descendants occupy the premises.  Description  Rainworth, residence of Sir Augustus Charles Gregory, Bardon, circa 1885 Rainworth is a vernacular, short-ridge roofed house with stepped but straight-roofed verandahs on three sides. The front elevation shows three pairs of French doors, and one on the lefthand side. Early photographs indicate that the rear of each side verandah had been built to form an enclosed pavilion. Most exterior walls are of twelve inch chamfer-boards, while interior walls are lined horizontally with beaded tongue and groove boards, as are the high ceilings. For ventilation purposes, casement windows with small wooden knobs may be opened above the French doors.  Heritage listing  Rainworth was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Rainworth is a scarce example of a vernacular 1860s dwelling of the steeply pitched short-ridge roof variety. In this case it was built as a farmhouse but is now part of suburban Brisbane. Rainworth is most important because of its long and personal connection with Sir A.C. Gregory. It still bears the stamp of Gregory the practical bushman rather than the prominent public figure.

It is the first single of their fourteenth album Nheengatu as well as the album's opening track. A short preview of the track was released in April 2014, when the album became available for pre-order. The track criticizes the police and is viewed by some as an update to their 1986 hit \\"Polícia\\", off their Cabeça Dinossauro album.  Lyrics  The song's introductory verse (\\"Você também é explorado - fardado!\\", which can be translated as \\"You are also exploited - uniformed (guy)!\\") was inspired by a sign seen amidst the 2013 protests in Brazil, held by a woman in front of a battalion of the military police, a sign that read: \\"Fardado, você também é explorado\\" (\\"Uniformed, you are also exploited). Commenting on the track's resemblance to \\"Polícia\\", guitarist Tony Bellotto said that they have similar critics, but with different focuses. He explained: Keyboardist, bassist, vocalist and co- writer Sérgio Britto said that the idea of the song is to focus on the fact that police officers are also victims of exploitation and, as such, should refrain from repressing demonstrations of other exploited people. In another interview, he stated: In his personal blog, he wrote a letter of clarification in response to people criticizing the band for supposedly supporting crime or willing to gratuitously depreciate the institution's image.  Music video  The single received a video, directed by Oscar Rodrigues Alves, who also co- directed the documentary Titãs – A Vida Até Parece Uma Festa, about the band's history. In the video, the members of the band are seen with clown make ups, in reference to the way people feel about their rights. The theme was a suggestion of Alves himself, who wanted the video to show a not so obvious interpretation of the lyrics, that is, a video with no direct references to the 2013 protests.

Biography Sōma was born as , and was the samurai in the service of Sendai domain, and her mother was a scholar of Chinese classical literature. She came into contact with Christianity through missionaries at an early age, and was sent to the Ferris Girls' School in Yokohama, and later transferred to the Meiji Girls' School in Kojimachi, Tokyo, where she studied under Hoshino Tenchi, Kitamura Tokoku and Tōson Shimazaki. She was given the pen name of Kokko by one of her teachers, with the cautionary note that for women authors, only a moderately shining light would be considered acceptable by society. In 1898, she married Aizō Sōma, a follow Christian, and moved to what is now Azumino, Nagano, where her husband was combining social activism with sericulture. page 115-117 However, she had frequent problems with her health and with adjusting to rural life, and the couple relocated to Tokyo in 1901. In Tokyo, Sōma purchased the Nakamura-ya bakery near the main gate to Tokyo Imperial University. In 1909, the shop relocated to Shinjuku. The bakery often hired foreigners or consulted with foreign residents in Japan for ideas on new products or new condiments to use, and the shop flourished, later added a café and restaurant. From 1908, Rokuzan Ogiwara, a sculptor and acquaintance of her husband, returned from studying under Rodin in Paris, returned to Japan and the Sōmas built an atelier for him adjacent to their shop. This was the start of the Sōmas patronage of the arts and literature. The atelier grew to become a literary salon, whose members included Naoe Kinoshita, a socialist activist from Sōma's home town, Vasili Eroshenko, a blind Russian poet, as well as actress Sumako Matsui, painter Tsune Nakamura, poet and sculptor Kōtarō Takamura. In addition to providing financial support to struggling artists and writers, the Somas also provided support to the pan-Asian movement, and the salon provided a convenient and confidential meeting place for politicians, including Toyama Mitsuru, Inukai Tsuyoshi and others. The Sōmas provided shelter for Rash Behari Bose, the fugitive head of the Indian independence movement. Bose was the mastermind behind a number of bomb plots against the Viceroy of India and attempts to organize an uprising against the British Raj. Bose married Sōma's daughter Toshiko in 1918.

It was designed by architect Mervyn Rylance and built in 1940 by Jan Cupka. It was extended in 1964 and 1965. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  Oogarding, a two storey, rendered masonry house in the Mediterranean Revival style was built in 1940-41 to the design of architect Mervyn Rylance. The house is prominently located on a sharp bend in Simpsons Road in the Brisbane suburb of Bardon and is set on a large block of land, against a stand of tall gum trees. In 1940, Rylance was commissioned by Mr James Gervase (Gerb) Joyce and Mrs Edith Joyce to design a house for them on a one-acre allotment which had been subdivided from the Joyce family property in Bardon. Gerb Joyce was a well known Brisbane business identity and owner of the Helidon Spa soft drink company. The Joyces named their new house Oogarding, the Aboriginal name for the spa to which they owed their fortune. It appears that the Joyces commissioned Rylance on the recommendation of the builder Mr Jan Cupka. Cupka had constructed at least three other buildings designed by Rylance around this time. Rylance opened his architectural practice in Brisbane in 1933 and domestic commissions formed the basis of his practice. In the period up until World War II, he designed a number of relatively expensive and substantial homes in both the English and Mediterranean styles. The Mediterranean style established itself strongly in the temperate parts of Australia in the interwar period. This was largely due to the efforts of its central proponent, Professor Leslie Wilkinson and through his position as the first chair of architecture at an Australian university. Wilkinson was able to influence many architects with his ideas about the suitability of Mediterranean styled architecture for the Australian climate. In effect, the style was a regionalisation of Georgian domestic architecture and avoided blatant Mediterranean features such as those adopted in Spanish Mission architecture, preferring classical details, smooth render, soft tones and round arches that simply evoked a Mediterranean feeling. Mervyn Rylance was one of these young architects influenced by Wilkinson's ideas. Although he was born in Brisbane, Rylance was educated in Sydney and England and was an articled pupil with Joseland and Gilling Architects in Sydney. F Glynn Gilling was recognised as a leading practitioner of the Mediterranean Style and his Woolcock Forbes house was to have a lasting influence on Rylance. Very few pure Mediterranean Style houses were built in Brisbane and Rylance was responsible for the design of a number of key examples including the Blanchard House at 43 Maxwell Street, New Farm, the Bartlett House at 390 Swann Road, St. Lucia and Oogarding. The house was constructed by Mr Jan Cupka and it appears to have been built on the basis of a negotiated contract as no tender was advertised. When interviewed in 1995, Mrs Joyce remembered Rylance as \\"a dedicated professional\\", attending the site every couple of days during the nine month construction period. He personally applied the faux stone finish to the fireplace, throwing sand at the wet render and ruling in the joints with his pencil. In 1964, a new family room was added to the south-east corner of the house, to the specification of Terrence Reid. Later in 1965, Hayes, Scott and Henderson Architects designed a new garage, front terrace and other landscape works and re-modelled the kitchen. The Joyce family lived in the house from its construction until 1999 when the house was bought by the Gasteen family.  Description  Oogarding is a substantial two story residence with basement designed in the Mediterranean Style. It is constructed of load-bearing masonry that has been smooth rendered, recently re-rendered and painted in a creamy tone. The medium-pitched roof is clad in glazed terracotta Marseilles pattern tiles and has exposed rafter ends that are decoratively shaped on the front elevation and agricultural pipe vents set in a diamond pattern in the gable ends. The entrance door is a significant feature and is strongly expressed with raised rendered decoration to resemble substantial masonry surrounding the panelled door. The door, designed by Rylance, has eight square panels which are repeated in the form of a vertical strip of four square windows on either side of the door. The door is surmounted by a leadlight fanlight with the name of the house incorporated into the design. In plan, the house has an offset cruciform shape with the entry positioned at the core of the house on the Western side. A sunken passageway leads from the front door to a hall that leads, through large openings, to the dining room, lounge room and terrace as well as to the stairs to the upper floor. Each of these major public rooms occupy an arm of the cross in plan and the lounge in particular is generously proportioned. The dining room and lounge room are linked by timber and glass sliding doors with arched heads. An ornate fireplace with a faux stone finish and moulded decoration is a prominent feature of the lounge room, as are the decorative plaster ceilings of both public rooms. The terrace is a semi- enclosed room with a short arcade of three arched openings on the northern wall and single arches on the eastern and western walls. The suspended timber floors are red stringybark and covering tiles have recently been removed from several areas. All joinery and mouldings in the house are silky oak, apart from the handrail which is maple. The house was originally designed to cater for a family served by a maid and a secondary circulation route links the main public rooms with the kitchen and laundry areas. A bathroom is located between these utility areas and public areas and has a small antechamber adjacent to it. Renovations in the 1960s relocated the kitchen further to the south-east edge of the house, in the position formerly occupied by the maid's room. A round-arched loggia links the utility areas to the garage which provides accommodation for three cars. The second story accommodates four bedrooms, a bathroom and a sleepout. The expansive main bedroom is located directly above the lounge room in the north-east corner and has several built-in cupboards. The highly detailed bathroom has an alcove bath, a built-in shower recess, a decorative sandblasted mirror designed by the architect and a strong single colour scheme of carefully detailed blue tiles. On the exterior, the main bedroom projects slightly and is supported by corbels. On the northern wall, multi-paned French doors open out to a small semi-circular \\"Juliet\\" balcony. These doors are surrounded with raised rendered decoration similar to that around the front entry door. Windows throughout the house are generally multi- paned timber sash and casement windows and most have external timber louvre shutters. N.B This description was prepared on the basis of documentary evidence only, the place was not inspected.  Heritage listing  Oogarding was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Oogarding demonstrates the principal characteristic of a substantial, interwar Mediterranean Style residence with important style indicators such as asymmetrical massing, cement rendered masonry construction and Marseilles tiled roof, strongly expressed main entry door, round arched and arcaded loggia, \\"Juliet\\" balcony and multi- paned, double hung windows with louvred timber shutters.

Evesham was built for Evelyn Thomason (nee Horsman), who commissioned Rylance to design Evesham as a block of four flats with the penthouse flat intended to be her personal residence. Completed in June 1937, Evesham's stuccoed walls, Juliette balconies, asymmetrical massing and numerous arched windows reflect the popular inter-War Spanish Mission architectural style. Having regard to the building's prominent location overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River, Rylance designed the top left section of the building, above the exterior staircase, to resemble the bridge of an outgoing steamer. From a distance it was intended to appear like a riverside mansion. Each of the apartments is spacious with its own entrance. The rear two apartments included maids’ quarters. Reflecting a modern style of living of those times, features of the apartments included open plan living areas, built-in wardrobes and cupboards, as well as gas hot water heaters. The building features an abundant use of casement windows to capture cooling river breezes and to maximise the panoramic views over the river and neighbouring suburbs. Notable residents of Evesham included German soprano Madame Lotte Lehmann, during her May 1939 season at Brisbane City Hall, and Sydney A.

She is mostly remembered for sewing (or embroidering) the flag raised by Ismail Qemali during the Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlorë on 28 November 1912. Marigo was the daughter of Papa Kosta Poçi and Lenka Ballauri (from Voskopojë). Some official Albanian sources define Hoçisht village near Korçë (back then Vilayet of Monastir in Ottoman Empire) to be her birthplace. Some other and later sources mention Korçë itself. Her sister Urani was married to Albanian politician and playwright Kristo Floqi, while the other sister Angjeliqi was married to Albanian politician and Prime Minister Kostaq Kota. Her two brothers Niko and Kristo were both emigrants to US, the first one settled in Natick, MA, and the other in Salt Lake City. She was a relative of Albanian patriot Spiro Ilo, activist of the Albanian colony of Romania and signatory of the Declaration of Independence Act. Marigo was educated in the First Albanian School of Korçë, being the 27th student enrolled in it. She married Jovan Posio from Hoçisht at a young age. The couple used the last name Posio, although it shows up also as Pozio, Pozjo, or Bozjo. The couple moved to Vlora around 1904, in Muradie neighborhood. Their house served as a center for meetings and activities of Albanian patriotic figures of that time. Marigo was a member of the Labëria Patriotic Club founded in Vlore in 1908. She was one of the initiators of the Albanian School of Vlore of 1909. The Albanian Declaration of Independence took place on 28 November 1912 in Vlora. Marigo is considered the \\"mother\\" of the Albanian flag which was raised during the Independence Act. The official sources mention her to have embroidered the flag. Lef Nosi, respected Albanian politician present at the event, states that the black eagle was cut from satin and was sewed upon the red base. Ekrem Vlora mentions that the flag was a gift from Aladro Castriota and Marigo was given it to make copies. In all cases, she is involved. She also produced many copies of the flag on her own expenses for various offices of the Vlora Government. Marigo is considered a leader of the first Albanian Women Organization, which aimed at helping wounded soldier which came from the border war with Greece. The organization was founded on 13 May 1914. Other members were wives of prominent Albanian figures of the time, i.e. wives of Syrja Vlora or Mehmet Pasha of Delvina. On 6 February 1921, she started publishing her own paper Shpresa shqiptare (\\"The Albanian hope\\") which continued with 6 issues. The family suffered from a series of misfortunes, first with their children, and later with Marigo's health due to tuberculosis. Kristo Floqi raised his voice on 9 December 1928 accusing the Albanian authorities of having forgotten Marigo's contribution. Marigo did not receive the \\"veteran's status\\" like many others did post 1912. She died neglected and forgotten in 1932, and was buried in the Zvërnec Monastery cemetery.

This term refers to – a) externally to the place where the breath dies away, b) internally to the crown of the skull and known as brahmarandhra, and c) above the skull to the dvādaśānta which is twelve fingers breadth away from the brahmarandhra, and when no longer identified with the body but with the all-pervading Shiva it is the Cosmic dvādaśānta, a wheel with a thousand spokes, eternally present. Dvādaśānta is like the triśūla signifying three kinds of energy – of the will, of knowledge and of activity. The initial extremity (ādi-koti) is the heart (whence the breath rises) but the final extremity (anta-koti) is the dvādaśānta (where the breath finally dies away or rests). Abhinavagupta tells us that Shiva makes the sādhaka seek a worthy teacher and makes that teacher take up that task with extra responsibility and lead his śiśya towards liberation. The ānavopāya ('atomic') method utilises the creative functions of Shiva and raises the sādhaka to śaktopāya ('method of power') that employs the cognitive functions of the Lord. In this and other two succeeding methods mantra transmitted by the teacher to the śiśya plays a vital role. According to the Devyā-yāmala- tantra, the subtle breath composed of sound rising from the former's heart moves through a series of centers to rest in the dvādaśānta which is the terminal point where the suśumnā ends and the central pathway of the three paths. Vijñānabhirava (Dhāraṇā 28 shloka 51) states:- :यथा तथा यत्र तत्र द्वादशान्ते मनः क्षिपेत् :प्रतिक्षणं क्षीणवृत्तेर्वैलक्षण्यं दिनैर्भवेत् |which statement means that the ānavopāya involves fixation of the mind again and again at ūrdhava dvādaśānta or bāhya dvādaśānta or āntara dvādaśānta which is the incomparable and ineffable state of Bhairava (an aspect of Shiva). This text had earlier in shloka 28 explained that meditation on prāṇaśakti arising from the mūladhārā chakra getting subtler and subtler dissolves in dvādaśānta to manifest Bhairava. When the apāna remains in the dvādaśānta, it is known as the external kumbhaka (retention of breath as in a pot). When the prāṇa moves up to the nose-tip it is known as recaka and when it moves up to the extent of the dvādaśānta it is called external-recaka. The apāna moving inwards without the prāṇa is the internal-kumbhaka, and the apāna rising in the dvādaśānta attaining internal expansion is the internal-pūraka. According to Yoga Vasiśtha, the one who knows (experienced) these kumbhakas becomes liberated from the cycle of birth and rebirth; dvādśānta represents the highest seat of God in the body, the seat of the vibrating Self.

It is found in the intertidal zone on the coasts of northwestern Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea. Description Megatrema anglicum has a pink conical shell on a cup- shaped base and can grow to a diameter of up to . There are longitudinal striations on the shell and the operculum, the lid to the opening through which the barnacle's feeding parts protrude, is depressed, so that the structure is vase-shaped. Another barnacle, Verruca stroemia, is sometimes found at the foot of the coral's calcified cup, but M. anglicum seems to be the only barnacle species adapted to live in close proximity to the coral's tentacles. Ecology Caryophyllia smithi, the cup coral on which Megatrema anglicum is frequently found In British waters, where it is at the northern limit of its range, Megatrema anglicum is found in association with the solitary cup coral Caryophyllia smithii, and in the Mediterranean it is often associated with the sunset cup coral (Leptopsammia pruvoti). However, it has been found growing on corals of at least eight different genera. The cyprid larvae of the barnacle settle around the rims of the stony cups of the coral where they seem unaffected by the nematocysts (stinging cells). They become firmly attached and, except for their operculum, are overgrown by the epithelium of the coral. The barnacles benefit from this arrangement by being in an elevated position for better harvesting of food particles and by being free of competition from other organisms that are unable to withstand the coral's stinging cells. The coral probably derives no benefit from the arrangement so the barnacle can be considered an obligate semi-parasite. It is also likely to benefit from some diffusion of nutrients from the coenosarc (living tissue) of the coral which overgrows it, another reason for considering it parasitic.

It was designed by the Queensland Department of Public Works and built from 1948 to 1955. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 February 1999.  History  Stafford State School is a substantial three storey brick building located on a 5.138 hectare site on the corner of Stafford and Webster Roads, facing Stafford Road. It was constructed in 1948-49 as the principal building of Stafford State School, providing primary education to children of the Stafford district. Stafford State School also incorporates formal gardens in the foreground of the school and large open playing fields to the rear of the building, established at the same time as the principal school building. Stafford's original name was Happy Valley until 1886, when a government administrator questioned whether such a name was dignified enough to grace a new school. It is one of the few places in Queensland which takes its suburban name from the school. Happy Valley incorporated the suburbs now known as Everton Park and Stafford, and remained a semi-rural area well into the twentieth century. Local industry included tanneries, fellmongers and dairy farms. In 1886, a simple timber school building and teacher's residence were constructed on the original Collier Street site. This site later became Stafford State Pre-school. In 1940 the tramline from Red Hill was extended to Stafford Road. Closer settlement was encouraged with the establishment of a housing commission estate during World War Two on the eastern side of Webster Road and the Somerset Hill subdivision was established after the war. The general changes in post war Australian society felt through the return of service personal, a baby boom and an influx of immigrants from Europe coincides with these infrastructural planning changes for the area. In 1947, a 12-acre site was purchased for the new school from John Smith. During the second world war, substantial changes were made to the incorporation of physical education into the primary curriculum. Specialised physical education teacher training had commenced in Queensland in 1941 with the first batch of graduates employed under the Organiser of Physical Education in 1944. In 1944, the Director General of Education called for the \\"enlarging of existing school grounds or acquisition of new sites\\" to accommodate facilities for field games. At this time organised games revolving around fair play and emphasising teamwork were included as part of the broader themes of educational philosophy. In order to accommodate such changes, the Department of Public Instruction began to purchase sites which allowed adequate space to be dedicated to physical education. Stafford State School had two full playing ovals accommodating football, cricket, basketball, vigaro, hockey and athletics, with a swimming pool and grandstand complex added later. The building was designed by Frederick Thomas Wylie Warren of the Architectural Branch of the Queensland Department of Public Works and construction of the first stage was completed in 1948. A second stage was completed in 1955 from the original design. The form and architectural style of building is more typical of interwar brick school buildings, particularly those constructed under the Unemployment Relief Scheme. As such it was criticised in the contemporary press, by teachers and architects, as severe and barrack like, and representing an outmoded style of school building. From the 1950s a change in architectural direction for the Departments of Public Works and Public Instruction can be seen in the introduction of organic planning for state schools. The school was constructed of brick and concrete. It contained 16 classrooms situated on the first and second floors. A head teacher's room; male and female teachers' rooms; library; reading room; store and medical inspection room; and hat and cloak rooms were also provided. Some of the classrooms on the first and second floor had folding partitions and a kindergarten room was included on the first floor. Toilets were located on the ground floor, with the remainder of ground floor space dedicated to play areas. An infants school consisting of three buildings was excised from the original site in 1953, this set of buildings is now redundant and unoccupied. The infants school was reincorporated into the main school after the demand on school facilities decreased. The school buildings continues to house the primary school for this area, although students enrolled in the school has decreased in recent years.  Description  Webster Road view, 2015 Stafford State School is a substantial three storey brick building located on a 5.138 hectare site on the corner of Stafford and Webster Roads, facing Stafford Road. The site also includes substantial open spaces principally used as playing fields and located behind the complex of school buildings. Stafford State School is a symmetrical U shaped building, with a linear plan on an east-west access. At the centre of the northern facade is the projecting bay of the main entry and near either end are two smaller breakfronts with secondary entries. The roof is hipped and clad in red ceramic tiles. The front or northern elevation also has two breakfronts near either end which mark the linear plan. The external walls of the two upper levels of the building are face brick with the classrooms indicated by grouped casement windows with awning lights above. The two upper levels sit on the rendered base of the Ground Floor which has arcades and smaller window openings. The three-storey height, and Georgian-style symmetry, proportion and massing make the building prominent from both Stafford and Webster Roads. The central bay of the northern facade is emphasised as the main entry to the building by the triangular pedimented gable, the rendered entry door surround, the double stairway and projecting further than the end bays. Also mounted over the main entrance is a large arched window with 16 panes. The first and second floors contain a series of classrooms opening onto a corridor running the length of the building on the northern side. There are panelled doors with toplights and double-hung windows between the classrooms and the corridor. The east and west wings each house two classrooms and former cloakrooms. The high ceilings, regular external windows and internal windows and doors provide substantial natural light and cross ventilation. The two stairways, near either end of the building, have steel balustrades, cast newels and timber handrails. A third stairway is located in the centre of the building. The central projecting bay houses a number of smaller rooms that are used as administrative offices and staff facilities. The tuckshop, girls and boys toilets and maintenance storage areas are located in the undercroft of the building. The foreground of Stafford State School building is lawn, pathways and established plantings. To the west of the main building is the tennis courts. A second school building is located behind the main building and is a two-storeyed timber and corrugated iron construction. Between the two buildings is bitumened parade ground that is marked for ball games and parade positions. Simple timber and iron covered walkways run between the two buildings and a covered eating area is located to the east of the two buildings. Behind the building complex is a vegetated lot which includes a number of native plants enclosing smaller lawned areas with timber benches. A sign marks the area as Centenary Grove. The playing fields are located behind the Centenary Grove and consist of large levelled and lawned area, incorporating two cricket pitches and marked at the southern boundary of the school by a row of Radiata pine trees. The western boundary of the playing fields has a carpark and bitumened pick up area, constructed in 1998. The pool and grandstand complex is located on the eastern boundary of the playing fields along with a small grove of plantings in the south eastern corner of the site.  Heritage listing  Stafford State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 February 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Stafford State School is a substantial 1948 three storey brick and tile building, associated playing fields and gardens which demonstrates the importance of the post war development of suburban Stafford. The impressive form and scale of Stafford State School is indicative of the governmental confidence in post war stability and economic growth in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The main building of Stafford State School is one of the final buildings of the design series which is represented by works under the Unemployment Relief Scheme of the interwar period and as such it demonstrates the characteristics of a particular type of Queensland school. The main school building is a well composed institutional building and is complemented by surrounding gardens and established plantings. The associated grounds and gardens of the school demonstrate the emphasis placed on physical education as a part of a holistic pedogological philosophy. Stafford State School's open playing fields, swimming pool and gardens demonstrate the importance of the introduction of specialist physical education into the primary school curriculum. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The combination of imposing building and plentiful open spaces is a landmark in the suburban streetscape of the area.

It can be reached from British Columbia Highway 11 on the Canadian side and Washington State Route 9 on the American side. This crossing has been important since this part of the border was established in 1846, but it would be several more decades before settlements were established on both sides of the border. This is because level terrain made this an ideal location for both roadways and railroads to cross the border. Border inspection services were first established here in 1896. The land surrounding the Sumas-Huntingdon border crossing is so flat that it is prone to frequent flooding. Over the course of its history, the Canada border station at this crossing has sometimes been called \\"Huntingdon,\\" and sometimes \\"Abbotsford,\\" because of its location in Huntingdon, Abbotsford. Today the Canada Border Services Agency calls this station \\"Huntingdon-Abbotsford\\". History The Sumas Border Inspection Station Under Construction in 1932 The US first established a Customs office at Sumas in 1891, the year the Bellingham Bay and British Columbia Railroad completed its connection to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Canadian government established a border station at this crossing in 1896, and the US began renting a building for its US Customs officer in 1907. The road through Huntingdon was relocated in 1913, resulting in the Customs office being in a poor location. US Customs built a new border station on the east side of Cherry Street in 1914, and rented part of it out as an automotive repair shop. In 1932, as traffic continued to grow, and in response to smuggling during prohibition, the Sumas border station was upgraded once again. In 1949, the operating hours of the Sumas border station were expanded to 24 hours. The building was large and ornate, but when it was once again deemed inadequate in 1988, a fourth Sumas border station was planned. Rather than demolishing the historic building, the decision was made to move the 714 ton brick building intact to 131 Harrison Street, where it stands today. Construction on the current US border station was completed in February 1990. Canada built a concrete border station at Huntingdon in the 1930s, and replaced it with a brick facade structure in a style similar to the current facility at Carway, Alberta in the mid-1950s. This structure was replaced by the current twin-wing facility in 1992. This border station has been sometimes called \\"Abbotsford\\", and CBSA now officially calls this station \\"Abbotsford-Huntingdon\\".

Located on 1110 kHz, XERED-AM is owned by Grupo Radio Centro.1110 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency. The frequency is currently silent. History The concession history for XERED-AM begins with XEFO, a radio station launched in December 30, 1930Enrique E. Sánchez Ruiz, \\"Orígenes de la radiodifusión en México\\". Guadalajara: ITESO, 1984 on 940 kHz as the radio station of the National Revolutionary Party (later the PRI). The earliest available concession for XEFO dates to July 1, 1932. Despite the ban on political use of radio stations, XEFO radio was used as a method of disseminating party ideology, government accomplishments and as the chief medium of broadcasting news and propaganda during Lázaro Cárdenas's 1934 presidential election. XEFO was also relayed on shortwave XEUZ, which broadcast on 6120 kHz with 5 kW.Jerome S. Berg, The Early Shortwave Stations: A Broadcasting History Through 1945. McFarland, 2013: 158. Not long after Cárdenas was replaced by Miguel Alemán, XEFO was sold in 1941 to Francisco Aguirre Jiménez, who changed the callsign to XEQR-AM and used it to launch what became Grupo Radio Centro—which would end up buying Radio Red in 1994. However, XEQR was launched on a separate concession. In 1946, a new station on 1110 kHz was established, XERCN-AM, owned by Rafael Cutberto Navarro through concessionaire Radio Central de México, S.A., with the concession history of XEFO. In 1973, it was sold to Clemente Serna Martínez and his Radio Programas de México, who the next year launched a new format for the station, \\"Radio Red\\". The callsign was changed to XERED-AM and the station began pioneering longform news and talk programming. Radio Red's flagship newscast was Monitor, which started on September 2, 1974 and whose morning edition was hosted by José Gutiérrez Vivó. Also in the 1970s, the station launched an FM sister station, XHRED-FM 88.1. Monitor grew to have four daily editions (morning, noon, evening and midnight) and became Mexico City's top-rated radio newscast by the late 1980s. In 1994, RPM/Radiodifusora Red—which, by this point, had grown to include XERED-AM, XHRED-FM, and XHRCA-FM 91.3 in Mexico City, as well as Radio Red repeaters in Guadalajara (XEDKR-AM 700) and Monterrey (XESTN-AM 1540), was sold to Grupo Radio Centro. After the sale, Gutiérrez Vivó created Infored, which remained in charge of producing Monitor and other news programming, while all of XERED's other talk programs and hosts became part of Radio Centro. thumb For media concentration reasons, Radio Centro sold two stations (1320 AM, which became XENET-AM, and 1560 AM, which became XEINFO-AM) to Infored in 1998, with the stations relaunched in 2000. After a legal conflict between the two sides that culminated in a lawsuit won by Infored, in 2004 the Monitor newscasts were removed from Radio Red after almost 30 years on air (they continued on 1320 and 1560 AM until 2008). Radio Centro responded by increasing XERED's daytime power to 100 kW from 50 and replacing Monitor with their own news offerings. In 2017, citing \\"changes in AM transmission infrastructure\\", Grupo Radio Centro reorganized all of its AM radio stations, shutting down several and consolidating their programs. Formato 21's news wheel format moved from XERC-AM 790 to 1110 AM, which continued to carry the La Red de Radio Red newscasts. Most of XERED's non-news programs moved to XHFO-FM. On January 18, 2019, at 9pm, XERED went off the air due to another transmitter relocation, with their news and talk programming now only being available as an online-only stream (with classical music playing when no talk programs were scheduled). The Formato 21 newswheel format was rebranded as \\"Radio Centro Noticias\\" and moved to XERC-FM beginning on February 1, but ultimately disappeared at the end of the year. On August 8, 2019, the station's talk programming was combined with that of XEQR-AM in a single online stream under the latter's \\"Radio Centro 1030\\" banner, ending, for now, the use of the \\"Radio Red\\" name. The Radio Centro stream was eventually shut down on May 15, 2020. Format Before going off the air, XERED's format consisted of a 20-minute news wheel, along with multiple \\"La Red de Radio Red\\" longform newscasts throughout the day, featuring such hosts as Sergio Sarmiento, Jacobo Zabludovsky (who after his death in 2015 was replaced by Juan Francisco Castañeda) and Jesús Martín Mendoza. All three of the hosts left GRC in 2019 and the \\"La Red\\" newscasts were cancelled. Beginning in 2014, the station also carried Sunday afternoon games during the NFL season, which now air on XHRED-FM.

In the early morning of 10 March 1975 at the start of the Battle of Ban Me Thuot, the base was attacked by two People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) sapper battalions. While the PAVN sappers quickly penetrated the 44th Regiment base area, which was defended by only rear echelon troops, they met stiff resistance in attacking the 53rd Regiment's base and by dawn had been pushed out of the base with the loss of over 100 dead. The PAVN 149th Regiment launched another attack against the 53rd Regiment's positions on 11 March, but were forced back with numerous casualties. From 12–13 March the ARVN 45th Regiment was dropped by helicopter onto Hill 581 east of Phung Duc to begin a counterattack to retake Buôn Ma Thuột which had fallen on 12 March. At dawn on 14 March, the 149th Regiment launched another attack on the base supported by 6 tanks, the attack was again beaten back with the loss of 1 tank. A further attack was scheduled to take place during the afternoon, but some of the supporting infantry failed to arrive on time. The attack took place at sunset and the tanks became disoriented in the fading light and vulnerable to ARVN fire, by midnight the attack was called off. Simultaneously with the attack on Phung Duc the PAVN 24th Regiment supported by tanks attacked the ARVN 45th Regiment on Hill 581 scattering the 45th Regiment, killing over 200 soldiers and ending the hopes for a counterattack to retake Buôn Ma Thuột. At 3 am on 16 March the PAVN launched an artillery barrage on the 53rd Regiment base followed by a two pronged assault 90 minutes later by the 66th and 149th Regiments supported by tanks. The PAVN were unable to breach the base's earthen walls and lost 2 more tanks to rockets and anti-tank defenses. PAVN engineers eventually blasted a path through the defenses and by dawn on 17 March the PAVN had finally penetrated into the base. The 53rd Regiment commander Colonel Vo An and over 100 of his men managed to escape the base and make for ARVN positions at Phuoc An. Current use The base is now known as the Buon Ma Thuot Airport.

XHRED-FM launched in 1976, picking up a format previously heard on 1560 AM: \\"Radio VIP\\", programming and music in English. In the 1980s, the Spanish- language Monitor newscasts were added, airing simultaneously with XERED-AM. From 1987 to 1994, the station's callsign was changed to XHVIP-FM in reference to its name. In 1995, Radiodifusora Red—which, by this point, had grown to include XERED-AM, XHRED-FM, and XHRCA-FM 91.3 in Mexico City, as well as Radio Red repeaters in Guadalajara and Monterrey (XEDKR-AM 700 and XESTN-AM 1540)—was sold to Grupo Radio Centro. At this time 88.1 finally adopted the \\"Radio Red FM\\" name. The station continued to air the Monitor newscasts, now produced by Gutiérrez Vivó's company Infored, alongside contemporary music in English and a nightly program focused on jazz, which ended in 2001. For media concentration reasons, Radio Centro sold two stations (1320 AM, which became XENET-AM, and 1560 AM, which became XEINFO-AM) to Infored in 1998, with the stations relaunched in 2000. The two sides had a falling out, which in 2004 resulted in the end of the Monitor newscasts on Radio Red after 30 years. Radio Centro responded by increasing XHRED-FM's effective radiated power to 95 kW and expanding its own news offerings. In April 2013, the station dropped the \\"Radio\\" from its name. Universal 88.1 On May 16, 2016, Red FM and Universal 92.1 swapped dial positions. Despite the name change, the station's callsign remains unchanged, and XERED-AM was still broadcast over its HD Radio subchannel (until XERED-AM went off the air in January 2019). The Universal English classic hits format was created in 1974 on XEQR-FM. From April 9 to December 7, 2018, a morning newscast called \\"Sin anestesia\\" hosted by Carlos Loret de Mola was broadcast on the station, causing controversy among its listeners and lower ratings than its programming the year before. The newscast ended as Loret de Mola couldn't reach an agreement with GRC to continue it when GRC opted to consolidate its talk programming on a relaunched XERC-FM, which would have required the show to move to a new timeslot. La Octava As part of the launch of Radio Centro's TV station, XHFAMX-TDT, on October 31, 2019, Universal moved to XERC-FM and all the talk programming moved back to XHRED, which took the same \\"La Octava\\" (The Eighth) name as the TV station. Not all programming on La Octava radio is a TV simulcast; the most notable of these exceptions is Carmen Aristegui's morning newscast, as Aristegui has a deal with CNN.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, homaleoides is in reference to the similarity to Niebla homalea. Distinguishing Features Niebla homaleoides is characterized by a rigid thallus divided into sub[terete] mostly strap- shaped branches spreading from a holdfast, to 8 cm high, and by the absence of lichen substances except usnic acid and an unknown suspected to be a scabrosin derivative. The species is best identified by chromatography such as high- performance liquid chromatography or thin-layer chromatography. The cortex generally resembles that of Niebla cornea, whereas comb-like branchlets on some thalli are similar to those of Niebla josecuervoi. Other thalli that have flattened branches are similar to Niebla flabellata. PycnidiaPycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (300–450 µm wide near the base in N. homaleoides) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexuallyBungartz, F. 2002. Morphology and anatomy of conidia-producing structures, Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 1: 35–40 are prominent on the upper parts of branches, and appear to be among the largest in the genus, but comparative measurements are not available for all species of Niebla. Niebla homaleoides is related to the depsidone species within the genus by the absence of triterpenes, most closely to salazinic-acid species by the presence of an unknown, possibly scabrosin derivative. This lichen chemotype is found in the related Niebla flabellata, Niebla josecuervoi, and Niebla marinii. Scabrosin esters isolated from the lichen Xanthoparmelia scabrosa have shown activity against human tumor cell lines at nanomolar concentrations.Moerman K. L., C. L. Chai and P. Waring. 2003. Evidence that the lichen-derived scabrosin esters target mitochondrial ATP synthase in P388D1 cells. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 190(3): 232–240.  Taxonomic History  Niebla homaleoides was discovered by Richard Spjut, accompanied by Richard Marin and Thomas McCloud, on 19 May 1986 just south of Punta Negra on rock outcrops on a ridge that appeared to receive more precipitation from ocean fog than other nearby areas (Plate 1D in Spjut’s 1996 revision of Niebla and Vermilacinia). This particular ridge was observed during May 1985 by Spjut—while he and Marin were collecting samples of lichens in search of new drugs to treat HIV—to have fog lingering around the peaks most of the day. The following year, in May 1986, a special effort was made to find a path to the ridges and peaks. In addition to Niebla homaleoides, other rare new species of lichens were discovered, Niebla infundibula (divaricatic acid) and Vermilacinia rigida. Except for N. infundibula, the species were also found on Punta Cono, 15 April 1990. A strong similarity of the Nieblas—and one other species on the same rock outcrop, Niebla josecuervoi (salazinic acid)—is suggested to be the result of hybridization, and also at another location, Arroyo Sauces, with Niebla flabellata, a species that is characterized by a flattened branch morphology.Niebla homaleoides, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 26 Dec 2014 The prominence of the pycnidia and their potential role in sexual reproduction has to be considered.Robinson, H.1975.

Generative economy claims to be based on designs that are rich in biodiversity, not monoculture. Examples of these types of organizational designs are employee ownerships, cooperatives, credit unions, community land trusts, co-housing communities, community wind, family-owned businesses, and foundations-owned companies (common in Northern Europe). Its goals are to create fair and just outcomes, benefit the many rather than the few, and enable an enduring human presence on the planet Earth. The generative (living) model is meant to contrast with the extractive (financial) model that fueled nations through industrialization; it is a postindustrial philosophy , and an alternative to conventional currency. Controversy Generative economy is arguably a better approach to the outdated extractive economy, but the transition to such a model must attempt to anticipate the difficulty in transforming participants behavior, such that living goals are prioritized and financial goals are not prioritized. It may be possible, albeit unlikely, that living and financial goals are not conflicting in the long-run for the majority of Earth's human population.

Description illustration Ivory sedge is a clump-forming sedge that spreads gradually by slender, light brown rhizomes to form colonies. It has narrow leaves, wide and long, that grow from the base of the plant and alternately on the culms (stems). The culms are longer than the leaves, long. The bases of the leaves and culms are wrapped in a light brown sheath. The leaves dry up after the growing season and persist at least until the next spring. Each inflorescence (flower cluster), at the end of a culm, has one staminate (male) spike above two to three pistillate (female) spikes, each enclosed at the base by a tubular bract. There are 3 to 10 florets in each pistillate spike. The scales under the florets are white and translucent. Pollinated florets produce three-sided seeds (achenes) that are glossy blackish-brown when ripe, long by wide. The stem of the inflorescence and the stems of the pistillate spikes are very short at blooming time, but lengthen a great deal by the time the seed matures, so that the clusters of achenes overtop the withered staminate spike and the stem is always longer than the leaves. Ecology Ivory sedge usually grows in coniferous or mixed woodlands, sometimes in fens, stable dunes, or alvar (shallow soil above limestone). It prefers sandy or gravelly soil with a neutral to alkaline pH.

The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. She is voiced by Seychelle Gabriel. The series' final scene, indicating the beginning of a romantic relationship between Asami and the female lead character, Korra, was unprecedented in its representation of LGBT persons in western children's television. Unlike many characters in the world of The Legend of Korra, Asami is not able to \\"bend\\", or manipulate, one of the elements of water, earth, fire or air. She is the only child of the wealthy industrialist Hiroshi Sato, who invented the \\"Satomobile\\" and whose company, Future Industries, is headquartered in Republic City. Asami is a trained engineer, skilled pilot and driver and competent unarmed combatant. Asami has been well-received with publications. Though many reviewers were content with her growth past being a love interest for Mako, some felt the relationship was not worth reviving. However, reception to her relationship with Korra was mostly positive.  Creation and conception  left Asami was initially conceived to be a duplicitous spy for the Equalist movement - antagonists in the first season - embedded within Team Avatar. However, the character became so well liked by co-creators DiMartino and Konietzko that they rewrote her to be a friend to Korra, and ignorant of her father's Equalist activities. DiMartino remembered that he and Konietzko \\"knew\\" they needed \\"a character who wasn't a bender\\" after they decided on the nonbender revolution storyline. Konietzko also floated the idea to the writing team that Asami might be bisexual \\"before the audience had ever laid eyes on\\" either her or Korra, but initially shelved the idea, assuming Nickelodeon would not allow it to be aired. This decision would be reversed after season two. An early script for the last episode of the first season, \\"Endgame\\", featured Asami joining the United Forces, a military in the universe of The Legend of Korra, at the end of the episode. The script was reworked sometime before the confirmation of the second season.Bryan Konietzko on the DVD commentary for \\"Endgame\\". Bryan Konietzko's design of Asami was based on the idea of an actress from the \\"Golden Age\\" of Hollywood in the world of Avatar, and her hair was inspired by that of Rita Hayworth, an American actress famous in the 1940s. Konietzko wrote that Asami's resemblance to the character Lust from the 2009 anime series Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was coincidental, as he had not seen the series at the time of Asami's design in 2010. Konietzko had previously had difficulty drawing women and chose to design Asami by himself, wanting a challenge.  Design  Asami's initial character design, from when she was meant to be an Equalist spy, was changed after co-creators DiMartino and Konietzko rewrote her to be an ally instead. Her design led viewers to speculate that the character would be a \\"femme fatale\\" when she first appeared. After it was revealed that she was not an Equalist spy, The A.V. Club noted that \\"it turns out that Asami's not bad—she's just drawn that way.\\" Throughout the first three seasons of The Legend of Korra, Asami consistently is seen wearing a dark red and gray jacket, red turtleneck dress, pink leggings and black boots. In her introductory episode \\"The Voice in the Night\\", Asami is also seen wearing formal attire, two different dresses, one while on her initial date with Mako and the other while attending a gala with him. Asami is also seen during the first season wearing a suit whenever involved in actual combat, which she retains throughout the series and wears the most during the third season when journey with Team Avatar. Her coat, which debuted in the season two (2013) episode \\"Rebel Spirit\\", was based on one Konietzko saw on a Japanese fashion website. She is only seen wearing the coat during the second season. Asami Sato as she appeared in season four; three years older, a bit taller, and with a changed hairstyle. The character was given a slightly different design in the fourth and final season of the series, which was revealed via a trailer for the season in September 2014. Asami was shown to have a different hairstyle, different clothing and grown in height. Her design went through a series of revisions, which included appearances with a hat and different hairstyles. DiMartino wrote that he loved the final version of her fourth season appearance, finding it to be a \\"nice balance of formal business attire and fashion forward elegance.\\" Entertainment Monthly wrote that while her appearance had changed, she still retained \\"the image of a businesswoman not to be messed with\\". Noriel Espinueva of Hallels felt the character looked \\"even more mature\\", adding that the design change contributed to the narrative that much had changed during the three-year gap between the third and fourth seasons of the series. The A.V. Club found her clothing to be more business-oriented than her previous attire and her hair to be worn in a similar manner to her mother.  Voice  Asami is voiced by Seychelle Gabriel. Gabriel's first involvement in the Avatar franchise was portraying Yue in The Last Airbender. Gabriel initially remembered Asami's name due to it sounding like \\"salami\\".Seychelle Gabriel on the DVD commentary for The Legend of Korra episode \\"Reunion\\" Gabriel was announced to be playing the role in March 2011, along with the rest of the main cast for the first season. Gabriel received The Legend of Korra scripts days before recording and was surprised by Asami turning against her father, calling it a \\"really weird situation to wrap your head around\\" as Asami had lost both of her parents. Gabriel was well-aware of the comparisons between Asami and Batman, having seen an Internet meme highlighting this and she and her parents were supportive of the friendship between Asami and Korra. She especially liked that they were two girls who did not let \\"a guy get between them\\", feeling that they were stronger together as well. While listing actors that he felt bore a resemblance to the characters of The Legend of Korra and could potentially play them in a live-action film, Tommy DePaoli of Moviepilot mentioned her as a suitable candidate, writing that Gabriel \\"would make an impeccable Asami.\\"  Appearances   The Legend of Korra  Asami Sato first appears in the series in the season one episode \\"The Voice in the Night\\", wherein she meets Mako by hitting him with her moped in a minor traffic accident. Recognizing him as the captain of the pro-bending team \\"Fire Ferrets\\", she invites him out to dinner by way of apology. A fan of pro- bending, she offers to become the team's sponsor. She meets Korra at a gala thrown in her honor by Tarrlok, commenting that Mako had told her much about her and making Korra jealous. On a date with Mako in Republic City Park, she expresses her trust in him while resting against him. She was a supporter of the \\"Fire Ferrets\\" and visible in attending their matches. Without running it by her father, Asami offers Mako and his brother Bolin a place to stay at her father's estate in the aftermath of an Equalist attack on the Pro-bending Arena. Asami takes the brothers and Korra to a racetrack to watch the test- driving of the Satomobiles. Noticing Korra's excitement over seeing them, she takes her on a ride while at the same time racing against one of the drivers, encouraging her to \\"mix it up sometimes.\\" This is the first time Asami and Korra are mutually friendly to each other. Asami's mother is later revealed to have been murdered during a triad robbery of their mansion when she was six years old. Her father, Hiroshi Sato, maintained a hatred of all benders thereafter - this is his motivation for joining the Equalists, an anti-bending movement that served as the antagonistic group of season one. Upon discovering her father's role, Asami joins with Korra, Bolin, and Mako, to form Team Avatar, turning against her father. This leads to a battle against Hiroshi Sato and his mecha, during which her father attempts to kill her. With Bolin's help, she defeats and captures Hiroshi. Asami's relationship with Mako faces difficulty when she becomes suspicious of him having romantic feelings for Korra when he only briefly addresses her before continuing his search for her, leading her to wonder why he is so concerned. She questions Bolin about it and presses the evasive earthbender about his brother, who he reveals previously shared a kiss with Korra. Following the group finding her, she confronted Mako over their kiss and when he tried to schedule their conversation for another time, she alluded to the possibility of breaking up with him before they could do so. She shows her disappointment with Mako exclusively, not blaming Korra for the deterioration of their relationship. Mako later pulls her aside to express how much he cares for her. In response, Asami relates her own positive feelings for him and kisses him on the cheek, ending their romance on a good note. Between seasons one and two, and following her father's imprisonment, Asami assumes control of Future Industries. With the reputation of the company in tatters, Asami needs to collaborate with the entrepreneur Varrick to save her company from bankruptcy. However, Varrick is later found to be committing acts of violence, fraud, and theft to entangle the Republic in the Water Tribe Civil War. After Varrick is arrested, the deal is nullified, and Asami regains full control of her company. Future Industries becomes an economic powerhouse; Asami herself becomes an urban planner, leading the reconstruction of Republic City's infrastructure after the physical return of Spirit World creatures to the human world. She briefly resumes her relationship with Mako after confiding in him in the midst of his investigation of the stolen shipment of mecha tanks, though she initially apologizes before he reassures her and the two relive their first date as he was arrested by officers who had incriminating evidence on him after interviewing the arrested Triple Threat Triad members, Asami learning and being shocked that he had explosives and a detonator in his back room and being unsure of what to believe when he blames Varrick. Asami chooses not to visit Mako in prison due to its location reminding her of her father and instead spends time with his brother Bolin and later Korra, who forgot her breakup with Mako after being attacked by a dark spirit and losing a part of her memory. When the three go to pick up Mako from jail, Asami becomes angry with him for not telling Korra that they were in a relationship again. Asami is a participant in the civil war between the Southern and Northern Water Tribes, steering a battle ship she had acquired from Varrick as she picks up a distress signal from the Southern Water Tribe rebels, though she and the others opt to continue towards the Southern Water Tribe where she suggests herself acting as a diversion by launching an aerial assault, which she carries out and is eventually brought down by Desna and Eska, Korra's twin cousins. After being apprehended and while imprisoned alongside the others, she is freed by Bumi and accepts Korra's request to fly her father Tonraq so he can seek treatment for his injuries. Remaining there with Tonraq, Katara and Tonraq's wife Senna, Asami watches over Jinora and learns after she wakes that the others are safe and Korra has saved the world, relieving her. Throughout season three, Asami and Korra's friendship deepens. During a ride in Asami's car, the two engage in a friendly but honest discussion about Mako, whom they had both dated. They express happiness and relief that their \\"rivalry\\" over Mako did not destroy their friendship. This is the first time Korra refers to Asami as a \\"girlfriend\\", although at this point the term is not used romantically. When Korra decides to seek out new airbenders, Asami joins her team and also provides a Future Industries airship for them to use in their search. From that point on Asami and Korra spend a significant amount of time with each other, seeking out new airbenders, fighting against bandits and investigating a faction known as the Red Lotus. After both being captured by Earth Kingdom forces, they work as a team to escape from the Earth Kingdom airship where they were being held captive, resulting in the airship crashing into a desert. Asami is able to design a sand-sailer from the wreckage, which she, Korra, and their former captors collaborate to build. Following an attack from the Red Lotus on the Northern Air Temple, Asami volunteers to watch over Korra's body when Korra visits the Spirit World in an attempt to contact the leader of the Red Lotus, Zaheer. The final battle in \\"Venom of the Red Lotus\\" at the end of season three leaves Korra wheelchair-bound. Asami becomes her day-to-day caretaker during the first phase of her recovery. The series' final shot, showing Asami and Korra becoming a romantic couple, was seen as pushing the boundaries of LGBT representation in children's TV. In the fourth season, it is shown that Korra's recovery process takes three years, which she mostly spends at the South Pole. Asami is the only member of Team Avatar with whom Korra maintains contact during this time, as they write to each other about their fears and vulnerabilities. During this time, Asami designs the airbender wingsuits seen throughout the season, which are built by Future Industries. While Korra is absent, Asami meets with her jailed father, Hiroshi Sato. Asami reveals that she has been receiving but not reading her father's prison letters, and demands that he stop trying to reconcile. However, the relationship thaws as Hiroshi apologies, acknowledges his crimes, and expresses his pride in Asami, stating that Asami was the \\"greatest thing he ever created\\". Out for dinner with friends, Asami accidentally reveals that she and Korra had maintained correspondence, despite Korra's silence with everyone else, provoking resentment from Mako and prompting him to demand, \\"What's been going on between you two?\\" Also, when Asami reveals she has visited her father, Korra objects, asking if Asami really feels Hiroshi could be trusted. Asami angrily responds that she is well aware of her father's capabilities, and asserts that it is not Korra's place to second-guess her after being away for three years. Midway through season four, as the threat from Kuvira - now self-proclaimed founder of the Earth Empire - builds, Asami is summoned to Republic City Hall and ordered to work with Varrick to find a way to counter Kuvira's growing military threat. Asami agrees reluctantly, reminding Varrick she has not forgotten his past betrayals. Asami also reunites with her father, Hiroshi, who is allowed out of jail temporarily for the same purposes. As they prepare for a last-stand defensive effort, Asami tells her father she loves him, a sentiment he immediately returns. Hiroshi Sato loses his life in the battle, saving his daughter in an act of self-sacrifice, validating Asami's acceptance, and completing their reconciliation arc. Afterward, Asami has a private conversation with Korra, in which Korra apologizes to Asami for their years apart and Asami reveals how she could not have coped with the loss of her father and Korra on the same day, the two settling on taking a vacation together in the Spirit World. Korra and Asami later step into the spirit portal, turn to face each other, hold both hands and gaze into each other's eyes as the camera swings upwards into the portal, officially signaling the start of their romantic involvement.  Graphic novel trilogy  In part one, Korra and Asami spend time in the Spirit World exploring their romantic feelings for each other. The pair travel to the Southern Water Tribe to reveal their relationship to Korra's parents, both of whom are happy and supportive upon hearing the news, though Tonraq warns Korra that the rest of the world may not be as accepting of a same-sex relationship. Upon returning to Republic City, the couple meet tycoon Wongyong Keum who plans to form an amusement park on the land surrounding the Spirit Portal. Asami loses her temper, recalling Kuem's shady dealings with her own father, and orders him to leave. Asami begins drawing up plans for new housing developments for the people who have displaced following Kuvira's assault, which President Raiko agrees to help fund along with Future Industries and Varrick Industries. At Air Temple Island, Korra and Asami receive advice from Kya on their relationship and the history of how same-sex relationships have been viewed in their world. Asami helps the Air Nomads when the Triple Threat triad, on Keum's orders, attempt to drive them away from the Spirit Portal. Asami is nearly killed in the fighting, distracting Korra and allowing a dragon-eel spirit to attack the Triple Threat's new leader, Tokuga. In the aftermath of the battle, Korra kisses Asami out of relief, leading to Mako, Bolin, Jinora and Opal discovering their relationship. Three weeks after Tokuga's defeat, Korra told Asami she is in love with her, and Asami said she feels the same way about Korra. Appearances in other media In March 2015, Bryan Konietzko posted previously unseen artwork of Korra and Asami embracing, entitled Turtle-duck Date Night. The art was announced to be sold as an exclusive print for The Legend of Korra / Avatar: The Last Airbender Tribute Exhibition at Gallery Nucleus and that its proceeds would be donated by Konietzko to an LGBTQ suicide prevention hotline. After same-sex marriage was declared legal in all 50 states of the U.S., Konietzko posted a rainbow version of the artwork. Asami appears in The Legend of Korra books Revolution and Endgame, two novels that together adapt the first season of the series.  Characterization   Personality  Raised in wealth and luxury, Asami is introduced as a sweet, caring, and independent young woman capable of handling adverse situations; she has trained in self-defense combat since childhood, and is \\"more than able to take care of herself\\". Throughout the series, she maintains a collected and mature presence in the cast, using her wealth and abilities both to defend Republic City and to help others, defying both the daddy's little girl and bratty teenage daughter tropes. In a collection of highly emotional personalities, Asami is described by The A.V. Club as the \\"brains\\" of \\"Team Avatar 2.0.\\" Asami's independence and strength of character leave her unafraid to stand up for her beliefs. She sides with her bender friends against her father, Hiroshi Sato, after he was revealed to be integral part of the anti- bender Equalist movement - a decision The A.V. Club referred to as \\"stone cold\\". After the events of the first season, Asami Sato evolved into a major in-universe business leader and was revealed to be a genius engineer/inventor, comparable with Bruce Wayne. DiMartino specifically compared her post-season one background and capabilities - although not personality - to those of Batman. Hallmarked through much of the series by her equanimity, Asami is naturally a very logical and forward thinking person, never allowing her emotions to cloud her judgement, and seldom maintains grudges over time. She never holds generalized prejudice against benders, despite losing her mother as to a murderous triad firebender in her childhood; she harbors little long- term ill will towards Mako after their romantic breakup, remaining friends after a period of upset - she even shows little animosity towards Korra after the Avatar 'stole' her then-boyfriend Mako. Instead, she develops a deeper friendship with Korra - so much so that the two become romantically involved in season four. The major exception to this theme is the resentment Asami carries against her father, Hiroshi, for both his emotional betrayal and physical attempt on her life. She musters no sympathy or forgiveness toward him for several years, preferring to keep him out of her life, and refusing his attempts at reconciliation. However, after receiving a heartfelt apology from jail, and coming through correspondence to understand how much he was suffering from his own guilt, she eventually forgives him, echoing familial- reconciliation themes exhibited throughout The Legend of Korra.  Skills  Asami is shown to be a practical thinker and a capable engineer, able to repair and construct vehicles and other period technology with limited resources, such as when she improvised a makeshift sand-sailer using materials from a destroyed airship. She is also a skilled Pai Sho player, proving to be an effective strategist. Although she is a non-bender, Asami is highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat, a result of her father having her to be trained by the best self-defense teachers in Republic City from an early age after the death of her mother so that she would always be able to defend herself. Her weapon of choice is an electrified glove, which she typically uses to incapacitate her opponents. Asami is particularly nimble in combat, once eluding attacks from five chi blockers before using her electrified glove to stun them all. Additionally, Asami is Team Avatar's de facto machine operator. Asami is an excellent automobile and moped/motorcycle driver in a technological period where that is new, having learned through test-driving her father's Satomobile line of vehicles; she taught Avatar Korra to drive, as well. Asami can also pilot airships, and operate other machinery such as motorboats, sand-sailers, and forklifts. Having assisted her father in operating their company before assuming engineering and management responsibilities, she has developed a keen eye for discerning high quality design and construction from subpar work, and utilizes this knowledge to further Team Avatar's goals in episodes such as season three's \\"Long Live the Queen\\".  Reception  Asami Sato's role in the series has been met with acclaim. As an engineer and leader in a STEM field, Asami has been praised as an inspiration for young girls to pursue a career in such fields, particularly by LGBT-friendly commentators and fans. While initially criticized as underdeveloped, the character was praised for growing beyond her initial depiction as an apparent romantic foil into a successful CEO. Tyler Edwards of The Artifice called her \\"a great example of a formidable woman\\", citing her status as the only main character without bending abilities and her compensating by using her martial arts and technology in place of it. Zach Blumenfeld of Paste ranked Asami as the 7th best character from the Avatar universe, noting that Asami is \\"badass\\" and displays \\"immense emotional maturity\\" throughout the series. The character's initial role as the romantic rival to the series' protagonist, Korra, was also called into question. While Max Nicholson of IGN enjoyed the rivalry, other reviewers felt that Asami was more likeable and sympathetic than Korra, making it difficult to root for the latter. Reviewer Jason Krell criticized the brief reintroduction of the Asami- Mako relationship in Season 2. Krell commended the character for not prioritizing the relationship when \\"more important things were at stake\\", but felt Asami \\"should know better than to take Mako back for a second time.\\" Noel Kirkpatrick wrote that he did not understand why either Asami or Korra had been interested in Mako \\"aside from the fact that he's the only single dude around who wasn't Bolin.\\" The depiction of the character's complex relationship with her father also received praise. Nicholson expressed that her falling out with her father Hiroshi Sato would make a \\"compelling moral struggle\\" and compared their relationship to that of Avatar: The Last Airbender's Zuko and his father Ozai. Asami's interactions with her father after he redeems himself in the fourth season were seen as \\"poignant scenes\\". The scene prior to his sacrifice, in which she realized he would soon be killed, was viewed as \\"heartbreaking\\". Relationship with Korra The depiction of a romantic relationship between Asami and Korra in the show's final moments received widespread praise. Vanity Fair praised the writers for taking \\"a tired dynamic between two women and turn[ing] it into something fresh and exciting,\\" while Polygon wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation to be a strict divide between \\"gay\\" and \\"straight\\". Some reviewers felt that the two characters complemented each other well as a couple, with Korra's brashness balancing Asami's calm nature. Joshua Rivera of Entertainment Weekly praised the ending scene, writing that after struggling with their legacies, Korra and Asami have rejected the world's expectations of them so as to make their own destiny. Korra and Asami's relationship has also been noted for being a \\"landmark moment for American and family animation.\\" The Advocate included Korra and Asami in their 2017 list of \\"35 LGBT Characters Who Redefined Family TV\\", noting that the series \\"ended on a note that changed family television forever.\\" In 2018, io9 ranked the series finale's reveal of Korra and Asami's relationship #55 on its list of \\"The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years\\". Among the critics who viewed the pairing negatively, E. Steven Burnett of Christ and Pop Culture wrote that the depiction of a same-sex relationship “hijacks Korra’s story in service of social causes to the detriment of its own creative storytelling.\\" Daniel Rodrigues-Martin of Geeks Under Grace agreed that the pairing was a detriment to the characters and story, opining that there was no foreshadowing of a romantic relationship between the two characters until the series' final moments. In response to criticism that the relationship was thrown in to appeal to fans who \\"shipped\\" Korra and Asami, Konietzko pointed out that any decision they made regarding Asami's romantic life could be interpreted as caving to a specific group of fans who supported Asami being paired with a certain character, and claimed that at the end of the day, the creators went for the relationship that felt right to them. He also suggested that anyone who felt the relationship was not adequately foreshadowed had watched the last two seasons only expecting to see heterosexual relationships. Gay Star News agreed that the romantic relationship between Asami and Korra has been heavily foreshadowed. Prior to the airing of the series finale, the two characters had drawn comparisons to Aang and Katara's relationship in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Prior to the reveal of the romantic relationship, there was a positive reception to the friendship between Asami and Korra, the two being viewed as \\"perfect partners\\" in that their personalities and abilities complemented each other. The Mary Sue noted Asami's role in Korra's recovery from PTSD, while The A.V. Club pointed out that Korra only writing back to Asami out of all her friends showed the strength and growth of their relationship. The relationship was praised for having realism, including depictions of disagreements between the two. Nicholson called the friendship his \\"favorite character dynamic\\" of the third season. On the other hand, Juliet Kahn of ComicsAlliance did not understand what \\"binds\\" Asami and Korra together due to Asami's underdeveloped personality.

Life He was the eldest son of John Macaulay, by his second wife Margaret Campbell; Colin Macaulay and Zachary Macaulay were brothers, and Thomas Babington Macaulay was his nephew. He graduated M.A. at Glasgow University in 1778. After acting for three years as tutor to the sons of Joseph Foster Barham I at Bedford, he took holy orders, and obtained a curacy at Claybrooke, Leicestershire. He remained there until 1789, when he became rector of Frolesworth; but then resigned the living after a year, in 1790. He had been admitted as a sizar in 1785 at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, but is not known to have graduated. In 1793 Macaulay went on a tour in Holland and Belgium, an account of which he wrote for the 1793–4; and next year, as travelling tutor to a son of Sir Walter Farquhar, he visited the court of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and gave English lessons to his daughter Caroline of Brunswick, who later married the future George IV of the United Kingdom. In 1796, after his return, Macaulay was presented by his brother-in-law Thomas Babington to the living of Rothley. In 1815 Macaulay made another tour on the continent, and four years later, on 24 February 1819, died of apoplexy. Works Macaulay published sermons, and: * Essays on various Subjects of Taste and Criticism, 1780. * Two Discourses on Sovereign Power and Liberty of Conscience, translated from the Latin of Gerhard Noodt, 1781. While in residence at Glasgow Macaulay contributed to Ruddiman's Magazine, under the signature \\"Academicus\\". For John Nichols's History of Leicestershire he wrote The History and Antiquities of Claybrooke, in the County of Leicester, including the Chapelries of Wibtoft, Little Wigston, and the Hamlets of Bittesby and Ullesthorpe. His European travels were written up for the Gentleman's Magazine. Family Macaulay married Ann, daughter of John Heyrick the town clerk of Leicester; they had eight sons. The abolitionist Elizabeth Heyrick was Ann's sister-in-law. The second son, Colin Campbell Macaulay (1799–1853), became partner in a firm of solicitors at Leicester. He was president of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1847, and contributed to their transactions. He died on 20 October 1853 at Knighton Lodge, Leicester, and was buried at Rothley. By his wife Mary Kendall, eldest daughter of Richard Warner Wood, he left a son and a daughter. The politician Kenneth Macaulay was another son.

Dopaj, Dupax del Sur, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. The parish church, under the advocation of Saint Vincent Ferrer, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong. The church complex has been declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines in July 2001. Parish History Dupax started as a mission by the Dominican Priests to convert the native group called Isinays into Christianity at around 1602. The Dominicans pushed through with the evangelization of the region until 1704 when the missions were turned over to the Augustinians because of lack of personnel. By 1740, the said missions in present-day Nueva Vizcaya were returned to the administration of the Dominicans. Architecture and Design Architectural History An earlier church structure of modest design might have been erected before 1773 and records tell that the structure may have been reused as a schoolhouse after the erection of the present church at around 1773 by Father Manuel Corripio, OP. By this time, the church of Tuguegarao by Father Antonio Lobato, OP was already standing. Like the earlier Tuguegarao church, Father Corripio had the church of Dupax made of bricks and even had two kilns made near the church complex, one for firing bricks and the other for preparing lime. The current façade, which mimics the silhouette of the earlier Tuguegarao Cathedral and is reflected on the churches of Bayombong and Bambang in Nueva Vizcaya, dates back to 1776 while each level of the bell tower bears inscription of the years when which it must have been completed. Its original titular patron is the Nuestra Señora del Socorro but was replaced by San Vicente Ferrer soon after the mission was returned to the Dominicans.

Unlike the church of Tuguegarao, the church of Dupax has no spiral columns and pilasters that offer support to the structure. The façade is divided by cornices into horizontal segments of plastered brick. The first level features a semicircular arched main portal embellished with clay insets. The main doorway is flanked on both sides by two blind windows with an embossed image of the Holy Eucharist. The second story features a niche and two windows framed by embossed carvings. The triangular pediment is divided into two horizontal sections with the lower half pierced with a deeply recessed oculus and the upper part featuring a relief of a cross. The entire pediment is capped by undulating cornices and seven finials, with the central finial crowned with a cross. To the left of the façade is the four-level, unplastered, rectangular bell tower. The base features saint’s niches similar to that found on the second level of the façade while the second level features long, narrow windows framed with bracket columns. The tower is capped with a decorative parapet and a small cupola surmounted by a cross. The church plaza is enclosed by a low perimeter wall and a replica of an earlier atrial cross.

He was the Regional Director (North) of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and also served as the Project Archaeological Director in the Aga Khan Trust for Culture from 2013 to 2016. He was honored with India's highest civilian honor Padma Shri in 2019 by President Ram Nath Kovind. Biography  Early life and education  KK Muhammed was born in Calicut, Kerala in a middle-class family to Beeran Kutty Haji and Mariyam. Muhammed is second amongst five siblings. After completing his schooling from Government Higher secondary School, Koduvally, he obtained his master's degree in history (1973–75) from Aligarh Muslim University and his postgraduate diploma in archaeology (1976–77) from the School of Archaeology, Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi, India. Career Muhammed served as technical assistant and then as assistant archaeologist in the Department of History at Aligarh Muslim University., before being selected as deputy superintendent archaeologist for the Archaeological Survey of India. Muhammed was initially posted at Madras in 1988 and then at GoaI in 1991. He was promoted to superintendent archaeologist in 1997 and subsequently served in many states in India, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. During this period, he also served as a tour guide to for prominent foreign guests such as Barack Obama and Pervez Musharraf.Mission Conservation In 2012, Muhammed was made regional director (North) of the Archaeological Survey of India, and he retired in the same year.  Major projects   Ibadat Khana  Ibadat Khana was a complex established by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1575 for hosting religious debates and discussions among theologians and professors of different religions. It was also the structure where Akbar first proclaimed the formation of the composite religion known as Din-e Ilahi. In the 80s, Muhammed, was a member of a team from the Archaeological Survey of India and Aligarh Muslim University visiting Fatehpur Sikri. With the help of a painting from Akbarnama, he convinced the others to excavate the mound, and they found more proof, including paintings of Christian missionaries from Spain and Italy (Fathers Monserrate and Rudolf Acquaviva). For centuries, the location of the complex had been controversial among archaeologists and historians, although it is generally accepted to be the place Muhammad discovered.  Excavations of the Babri Masjid  KK Muhammed was a part of the 1976 excavation of the Babri Masjid, led by B. B. Lal. He stated in a rediff interview that they had found remains of a temple on the western side of the mosque, however his findings were suppressed by Marxist historians like Irfan Habib, who he says were very powerful and influential towards the Indian Council of Historical Research and many leading newspapers. Muhammed also said they found 12 pillars in the excavations which were constructed with Hindu symbolism, including Ashtamangala signs. They had also found terracotta figurines of humans and animals, which Muhammad uses to hypothesize that a temple existed before the mosque.  Dantewada temples  KK Muhammed restored the Barsoor and Samlur Temples in Dantewada District near Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. This area is known to be the seat of Naxal activities in the region. In 2003, KK Muhammed was able to convince Naxal activists and with their co-operation, conserved the Temples to its present-day state.  Bateshwar Complex restoration  Bateshwar, Morena, a complex of 200 ancient Shiva & Vishnu temples situated 40 kms away from Gwalior. These temples were built between 9th and 11th century during the Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty, 200 years before Khajuraho. The area was under the control of Nirbhay Singh Gujjar and Gadariya Dacoits. KK Muhammed was successful in convincing the dacoits to let him do the restoration. He was able to restore 60 temples during his tenure. After the dacoits were eliminated by the police, the area has been under encroachment from illegal mining, as the tremors from the usage of explosives can damage the structure. In his autobiography, Muhammed alleged that a powerful mining lobby did not allow temple restoration work to on go and he himself made several attempts to get the mining work stopped.  Facelifting of Delhi's monuments  KK Muhammed was appointed as the Superintending Archaeologist of Delhi Circle, Archaeological Survey of India in 2008. His primary task was to carry out a major facelift and preservation activity at 46 monuments for the Commonwealth Games of 2010.  Other prominent tasks  * Discovered the first Christian Chapel of North India built by Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri. * Excavated the Buddhist Stupa of Kesaria built by Emperor Ashoka. * Discovered and excavated Buddhist Stupa in Rajgir. * Excavated the Buddhist archaeological site in Kolhua, Vaishali. * Located and Excavated a number of rock cut caves, Umbrella Stones, Cists and Dolmens in Calicut and Malapuram districts of Kerala. * Muhammed conceived and executed the idea of building a Museum that showcases replicas of Indian statues and stone-carved sculptures. The museum, called the Replica Museum, is situated outside the Siri Fort Sports Complex, behind Siri Fort Auditorium in Delhi. Autobiography In 2016, KK Muhammad's Malayalam- language autobiography Njan Enna Bharatiyan (\\"I am Indian\\") was released. The book attracted controversy due to his claim that the Marxist historians sided with the extremist Muslim groups and derailed attempts to find an amicable solution to the Ayodhya dispute. According to him, archaeological excavations at Ayodhya clearly indicated the presence of a temple below the mosque, but the leftist historians dismissed these, and even tried to mislead the Allahabad High Court.
