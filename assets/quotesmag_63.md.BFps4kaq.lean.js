Three-year-old season  As a three-year- old, As Indicated won the Sly Fox Stakes in the winter. In April, he competed in the grade two Gotham Stakes at Aqueduct at a mile. As Indicated saved ground under jockey C. V. Bisono, circled the field midway around the far turn, and overtook leaders Itaka and Strolling Along down the stretch to win by two lengths. Late in the spring, As Indicated had a minor injury that kept him out of the Triple Crown races in 1993. In June, he finished second in the grade three Woody Stephens Stakes.

It is often associated with Carey Street, where London's bankruptcy courts were once located. Origins The term appears in 1811 in the Lexicon Balatronicum: A Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit, and Pickpocket Eloquence, an updated version of Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. It is defined therein as: :\\"QUEER STREET. Wrong. Improper. Contrary to one's wish. It is queer street, a cant phrase, to signify that it is wrong or different to our wish.\\" Although often being associated with the Carey Street bankruptcy courts, which also lends its name to a similar phrase, the term Queer Street appears to predate the courts' move to Carey Street from Westminster in the 1840s. The folk etymology associating Queer Street and Carey Street has persisted and led to a number of explanations for its supposed origins: that 'queer' may be a corruption of 'Carey' or that it is a transmutation of the German language term Querstrasse (street running off at a right angle), the latter origin being akin to that of the idiom \\"orthogonal to\\" in the sense of \\"conceptually or logically incompatible with.\\"In and Around Covent Garden Literary uses Charles Dickens wrote a chapter in Our Mutual Friend (1864) called \\"Lodgers in Queer Street\\" about a corrupt moneylender plotting to bankrupt his \\"friends\\" because they outshine him socially.

World-systems are usually larger than single states, but do not have to be global. The Westphalian System is the preeminent world-system operating in the contemporary world, denoting the system of sovereign states and nation-states produced by the Westphalian Treaties in 1648. Several world-systems can coexist, provided that they have little or no interaction with one another. Where such interactions becomes significant, separate world-systems merge into a new, larger world-system. Through the process of globalization, the modern world has reached the state of one dominant world-system, but in human history there have been periods where separate world-systems existed simultaneously, according to Janet Abu-Lughod. The most well-known version of the world-system approach has been developed by Immanuel Wallerstein. A world-system is a crucial element of the world-system theory, a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to world history and social change. Characteristics World-systems are defined by the existence of a division of labor. The modern world-system has a multi-state political structure (the interstate system) and therefore its division of labor is international division of labor. In the modern world- system, the division of labor consists of three zones according to the prevalence of profitable industries or activities: core, semiperiphery, and periphery. Countries tend to fall into one or another of these interdependent zones core countries, semi-periphery countries and the periphery countries.Carlos A. Mart√≠nez-Vela, World Systems Theory, paper prepared for the Research Seminar in Engineering Systems, November 2003Thomas Barfield, The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, , is\\" hyphen&f;=false Google Print, p.498-499 Resources are redistributed from the underdeveloped, typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world (the periphery) to developed, industrialized core. World-systems, past world-systems and the modern world-system, have temporal features. Cyclical rhythms represent the short-term fluctuation of economy, while secular trends mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general economic growth or decline. The term contradiction means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term vs. long term trade-offs. For example, the problem of underconsumption, wherein the drive-down of wages increases the profit for the capitalists on the short-run, but considering the long run, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the crisis: a crisis occurs, if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system. The world-systems theory stresses that world-systems (and not nation states) should be the basic unit of social analysis.Immanuel Wallerstein, (2004), WORLD-SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, in World System History , [Ed. George Modelski, in Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS), Developed under the Auspices of the UNESCO, Eolss Publishers, Oxford ,UK Thus we should focus not on individual states, but on the relations between their groupings (core, semi-periphery, and periphery).  Immanuel Wallerstein  The most well-known version of the world-system approach has been developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, who has provided several definitions of what a world-system is, twice in 1974, first and second as In 1987 he elaborated his definition: Thus, we can differentiate world-systems into politically unified (world-empires) and not unified (world-economies). Small, non-state units such as tribes are micro-systems. World System vs. world- system(s) World system refers to the entire world, whereas world-system is its fragment - the largest unit of analysis that makes sense. Wallerstein stresses the importance of hyphen in the title: There is an ongoing debate among scholars whether we can talk about multiple world-systems. For those who support the multiple world-systems approach,E.g., Chase-Dunn Ch. K. and Hall Th. D. (1997), ‚ÄòRise and Demise. Comparing World - Systems‚Äô Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. there have been many world-systems throughout worlds history, some replacing others, as was the case when a multipolar world-system of the 13th-14th centuries was replaced by a series of consecutive Europe- and the West-centered world-systems.Abu-Lughod, Janet (1989), \\"Before European Hegemony: The World System AD. 1250-1350\\" Others coexisted unknowingly with others, not linked to them directly or indirectly; in those cases the world- systems weren't worldwide (for example, prior to colonization of Americas, the Americas world-systems had no connection with the one encompassing Eurasia and Africa).Andr√© Gunder Frank, Barry K. Gills, The world system: five hundred years or five thousand?, Routledge, 1996, , Google Print, p.3 From around 19th century onward, due to the process of globalization, many scholars agree that there has been only one world-system, that of capitalism. There are, however, dissenting voices, as some scholars do not support the contention that there is only one world-system in the modern day; Janet Abu-Lughod states that multiple world-systems did exist in past epochs.Janet Abu-Lughod.

He was one of the lead figures in the Mongolian Revolution of 1990 and Mongolian Democratic Union of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, Ganbold was elected as the Chairman of the Mongolian National Progress Party, which later merged to establish the Mongolian National Democratic Party. Mongolian National Democratic Party was one of the founding members of the current Democratic Party of Mongolia. Ganbold was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister of Mongolia between 1990-1992. Ganbold Davaadorj was elected as the Member of Parliament known as the State Great Hural of Mongolia between 1992-2000. Ganbold was the Chairman of the Parliament's Economic Policy Standing Committee from 1996 to 2000. He is considered to be one of the main people behind the Mongolian economic reforms of the early 1990s. In 1998 he was nominated for the position of Prime Minister of Mongolia five times between July 24 and the end of August of that year, and rejected by President Natsagiin Bagabandi on each occasion. In the end the Democratic Union gave up on getting Ganbold in as Prime Minister and instead nominated Janlavyn Narantsatsralt, whom was approved by the President of Mongolia. Ganbold is closely connected with the Buryat Mongol people.  Early life and education (1957‚Äì1987)  Ganbold with his grandfather Lodon Gotov(1959) Ganbold Davaadorj was born on June 26, 1957 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to Oyun.L and Davaadorj Tsedevsuren. The first of the 3 siblings, he has two sisters. Oyun, his mom, was a doctor. Ganbold's father Davaadorj is a prominent Mongolian economist and until 2016 he served as a professor at the University of Finance and Economics. Mr. Davaadorj, who was a close advisor to Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, was the official representative of Mongolia in Moscow for the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance during the Soviet Union. Ganbold grew up with and was very close to his grandfather Lodon Gotov (Oyun's father). Lodon was one of first neurologists in Mongolia, and established the very first modern soum hospitals in Tosontsengel, Aldarkhaan and Tonkhil soums of Zavkhan and Govi-Altai provinces. Soon after his grandfather passed away in 1966, Ganbold moved to Moscow with his parents. He studied in middle school in Moscow. In 1979, Ganbold graduated Moscow State University (MSU) with a Master's degree in economics. MSU is considered as the most prestigious university in Russia affiliated with 13 Nobel laureates as of 2019. After graduation, he joined National University of Mongolia as a lecturer of economics. Later, Ganbold went back to Moscow State University and graduated with Doctor of Philosophy degree in economics in 1987. He continued to teach at the National University of Mongolia until 1990.

In addition to composing madrigals in a relatively conservative style, works which were published as far away as England, he collaborated with Giulio Caccini on one of the earliest operas, Il rapimento di Cefalo (1600). Very little is known about Venturi del Nibbio's life. In 1592 he was in Venice, presumably to supervise the printing of his first two books of madrigals (Il primo libro de madrigali, and Il primo libro de madrigali pastorali, both for five voices), and in 1593 or 1594 he moved to Florence. After 1594 his known musical connections are all Florentine, and no unambiguous mentions of his name after 1600 have yet been found.Strainchamps, Grove online He had a reputation as a skilful composer of vocal music, both secular and sacred, in the conservative polyphonic style in a time and place in which a new musical style was quickly developing: monody, and the stile rappresentativo, developments which in retrospect demarcated the beginning of the Baroque era in music. In 1600 he collaborated with one of the chief practitioners of this new style, Caccini, in the music for the opera Il rapimento di Cefalo, by composing two choruses; since they are lost along with most of the music for the opera, it is not known to what degree they may have borrowed from the new musical language. Also in 1600, Venturi wrote some sacred music, for two choirs, for the nuptial banquet celebrated in the Duomo on 5 October for the marriage of Henri IV of France and Maria de' Medici.Carter, n.68 Venturi published a total of five books of madrigals. The earliest book, Il primo libro de madrigali of 1592, included two madrigals which were published in London with English words, one by Thomas Morley in his 1598 Madrigals to Five Voyces. In the introduction to the book Morley praised the work, and Venturi himself, as an exemplary composer of madrigals. Notes References *Carter, Tim. \\"Rediscovering Il rapimento di Cefalo\\".

The History of Galveston, Texas, begins with the archaeological record of Native Americans who used the island. The first European settlements on the island were constructed around 1816. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its successful revolution from Spain. The city served as the main port for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution. Galveston was founded in 1836 by Matthew Sabo and served as the capital of the Republic of Texas. The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay during the American Civil War when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city. During the mid-19th century, Galveston emerged as an international city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and the world. The city became one of the nation's busiest ports and the world's leading port for cotton exports. Galveston became Texas' largest city and, during that era, was its prime commercial center. In 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. Even post-Hurricane Katrina, this event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster. During the 1920s and 1930s, the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination centered on casinos and other vice businesses. Featuring venues, such as the famed Balinese Room, the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf. The illegal businesses were finally closed in the 1950s, leading to a long, stagnant economic period. Many businesses relocated off of the island, though some, such as the insurance businesses and the medical school, remained. The city gradually re-emerged as a tourist destination centered on its history and its historical buildings. New tourist attractions were established and further development of the medical school and other area businesses have revitalized the economy in recent decades. __TOC__ Exploration and settlement Bernardo de G√°lvez, Count of G√°lvez Galveston Island was originally inhabited by members of the Karankawa and Akokisa tribes who used the name \\"Auia\\" for the island. In 1519, the Alonso √Ålvarez de Pineda expedition sailed past Galveston Island en route from the Florida peninsula to the P√°nuco River. Pineda may or may not have actually seen the island, however, Spain lay claim to the entire Gulf Coast, including Galveston Island, based on the 1519 Pineda expedition. Soon afterward, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked on the island (or nearby) in November 1528, calling it \\"Isla de Malhado\\" (\\"Isle of Doom\\"), and from there began his famous trek to Mexico. Various Spanish explorers charting the region referred to the island as \\"Isla Blanca\\" (\\"White Island\\") and later \\"Isla de Aranjuez\\" (\\"Aranjuez Island\\"). In 1685 French explorer La Salle named the island \\"San Louis\\" (\\"Saint Louis\\") and the name became fixed for some time. The earliest known map of the island and the bay was made by French explorer B√©nard de La Harpe in 1721, who left the island unnamed but named the bay \\"Port Fran√ßois.\\" In 1785, Spanish explorer Jos√© de Evia, during his own charting of the Gulf Coast, referred to the island as \\"San Luis\\" and the bay as \\"Bah√≠a de Galveztowm\\" [sic] (\\"Galveztowm Bay\\"), in honor of Bernardo de G√°lvez y Madrid, Count of G√°lvez. The name San Luis for the island continued to be used by the Spanish and the Mexicans (and later even by Stephen F. Austin's colony), and is still used as the name for the pass at the west end of the island. The first permanent European settlements on the island were constructed around 1816 by the pirate Louis-Michel Aury as a base of operations to support Mexico's rebellion against Spain. In 1817, Aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against Spain to find the island occupied by the pirate Jean Lafitte, who took up residence there after having been driven from his stronghold in Barataria Bay off the coast of New Orleans, Louisiana. Lafitte organized the island's settlement into a pirate \\"kingdom\\" he called \\"Campeche\\", anointing himself the \\"head of government.\\" Lafitte remained at Campeche until 1821 when he and his raiders were given an ultimatum by the United States Navy: leave or be destroyed. Lafitte burned his settlement to the ground and sailed under cover of night for parts unknown. Following its successful revolution from Spain, the Congress of Mexico issued a proclamation on October 17, 1825, establishing the Port of Galveston, and, in 1830, erected a customs house. During the Texas Revolution, Galveston served as the main port for the Texas Navy. Galveston also served as the capital of the Republic of Texas when, in 1836, interim president David G. Burnet relocated his government there. In 1836, Michel Branamour Menard, a native of Canada, along with several associates, purchased of land for $50,000 from the Austin Colony to found the town that would become the modern city of Galveston. The Congress of the Republic of Texas hired Robert C. Trimble and William Lindsey to survey this land, and they completed the surveys in 1837. Menard and his associates began selling plots on April 20, 1838. In 1839, the City of Galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas. By this time, the name \\"San Luis\\" for the island had been abandoned and \\"Galveston\\" had become the island's exclusive name. The city of Galveston became important in the slave trade, establishing itself as the largest slave market west of New Orleans. Census records from 1860 show a population of 1,178 slaves (and two free blacks) compared to 6,000 free persons living in the city. The proportion of slaves, however, was somewhat less than the rest of Texas.Cotham (1998), p. 2-3. Succession as a whole, eventually led to the American Civil War, which Texas joined on the side of the Confederacy. The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay and island on January 1, 1863, when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city, which remained in Confederate hands for the duration of the war. In May 1865, the Lark successfully evaded the Union blockade off of Galveston Harbor and headed for Havana, becoming the final Confederate ship to slip through the blockade from any Southern port. In the late 1890s, the Fort Crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries were constructed in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads. Juneteenth, which is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States, owes its origins to the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation upon the return of Union forces to Galveston in 1865. Galveston was the first city in Texas to provide a secondary school and public library for African Americans. Golden era Map of Galveston in 1871 At the end of the 19th century, the city of Galveston was a booming metropolis with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion. During this golden era of Galveston's history, the city was home to a number of state firsts that include: the first post office (1836), the first naval base (1836), the first Texas chapter of a Masonic order (1840), the first cotton compress (1842), the first parochial school (Ursuline Academy) (1847), the first insurance company (1854), the first gas lights (1856), first Roman Catholic hospital (St. Mary's Hospital) (1866), first Jewish Reform Congregation (Congregation B'nai Israel) (1868), the first opera house (1870), the first orphanage (1876), the first telephone (1878), the first electric lights (1883), the first medical college (now the University of Texas Medical Branch) (1891), and the first school for nurses (1890). Beach Hotel catered to vacationers until a fire in 1898. Galveston was also home to the first Roman Catholic cathedral in Texas. In 1839, Rome created the prefecture apostolic of Texas, which was later elevated to a vicariate apostolic on July 10, 1841. Then, on May 4, 1847 Pope Pius IX approved the creation of the Diocese of Galveston and named St. Mary's Church the cathedral for the entire state of Texas. During the mid 19th century, Galveston, though not a large city by world standards, emerged as an international city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and around the world. The island has sometimes been called the \\"Ellis Island of the West\\" as it was the primary point of entry for European immigrants settling in the western United States. German immigration during this period was so great that the German language became a commonly used language on the city's streets.Hardwick (2002), pg. 28‚Äì29 The immigrants were not simply the poor or the oppressed seeking refuge but many of the educated, middle class. The Galveston Weekly News described one 1849 ship's arrival as carrying members of the \\"wealthy class\\" including lawyers and merchants and many skilled workers. The later 19th century was a high point in the history of civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to establish educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century. Galveston Grand Opera House Storm of 1900 Memorial marker along The Strand indicating a building that survived the 1900 hurricane. In 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. Even post-Hurricane Katrina, this event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster. In the early morning of September 8, high surf, despite prevailing winds out of the north, heralded the oncoming storm. By noon, low-lying areas near the Gulf and the Bay side of the city were flooding and the winds increased. Near 4 p.m. a storm surge approximately high slammed into the coast. Wind speeds reached approximately (an estimate, since the anemometer was blown off the U.S. Weather Bureau building). Isaac Cline was the bureau's chief meteorologist. An account of the events surrounding the hurricane, based on his personal records, is given in Isaac's Storm by Erik Larson. The city was devastated, and an estimated 6,000 to 12,000 people on the island were killed. After the storm, the city decided to shore up its defenses against future storms by constructing a permanent concrete seawall along a large portion of the beach front (1902‚Äì1904). The entire grade of the city was raised some behind the wall to several feet near the Bay (1904‚Äì1910). Rebuilding and the \\"Open era\\" Busy Dock Scene, Galveston, ca. 1912. Despite attempts to draw new investment to the city after the hurricane, Galveston has never fully returned to its previous levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by the construction of the Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into direct competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European, Jewish immigrants from the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews came to the city during this period.Hardwick (2002), pg.13 This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S. Though the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston grew into the region's principal metropolis, Galveston regained some of its former glory. Recognizing the need for Galveston to diversify from the traditional port-related industries, in 1905, William Lewis Moody, Jr., a member of one of Galveston's leading families, founded the American National Insurance Company. Two years later, Mr. Moody would further invest in Galveston by establishing the City National Bank, which would later become the Moody National Bank. A military facility by the US Army Coastal Artillery on Galveston Island was established in the late 1890s and construction, which was disrupted by the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, was completed in the early 1900s, with the facility being named Fort Crockett in 1903. During the First World War, Fort Crockett served as a US Army artillery training center. Troops bound for France were trained in the use of several types of artillery. During the 1920s and early 1930s, Fort Crockett housed the United States Army Air Corps' (USAAC) 3rd Attack Group (an ancestor to USAF's 3rd Wing). At this time, the 3rd Attack Group was the only USAAC group devoted solely to attack aircraft. During the Second World War, focus was placed on defense against German U-boats, and the fort also served as a prisoner of war camp. Following the war, Fort Crockett served for several years as an army recreational center. The Galveston‚ÄìHouston Electric Railway was established in 1911 and ran between the city and Houston. The railway was recognized as the fastest interurban line in 1925 and 1926. Stewart Title building in Downtown Galveston During the 1920s and 1930s, the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination. Under the influence of Sam Maceo, Rosario Maceo, and Oscar \\"Dutch\\" Voigt, the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the Balinese Room, offering entertainment to wealthy Houstonians and other out-of-towners. Combined with prostitution, which had existed in the city since the American Civil War, Galveston became known as the sin city of the Gulf. Galvestonians accepted and even supported the illegal activities, often referring to their island as the \\"Free State of Galveston.\\" The island had entered what would later become known as the open era. Aside from the vice-oriented entertainment the city hosted many legitimate entertainment venues and events. One of the most famous was the annual \\"Pageant of Pulchritude\\" beauty contest.* This event became the first international contest and attracted participants from England, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and many other nations until its demise in 1932. The 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the Island City. KLUF radio began broadcasting in 1937. During the World War II, the Galveston Municipal Airport, predecessor to Scholes International Airport, was redesignated a U.S. Army Air Corps base and named \\"Galveston Army Air Field\\". The United States Army Corps of Engineers, using funds made available by Congress through the Civil Aeronautics Authority, constructed three long, hard-surface runways at the airport to accommodate army aircraft. In January 1943, Galveston Army Air Field was officially activated with the 46th Bombardment Group serving an anti-submarine role in the Gulf of Mexico. Later it was replaced by the 10th anti-submarine squadron, flying RM-37 Lockheed Venturas. Postcard view of Beach Boulevard, early 1940s In 1942, William Lewis Moody, Jr., along with his wife Libbie Shearn Rice Moody, established the Moody Foundation, with the purpose of benefiting present and future generations of Texans.\\" The foundation, one of the largest in the United States, would play a prominent role in Galveston during later decades, helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs. The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally, in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which wrecked gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward. Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures including the failed Oleander Bowl football tournament and the Pelican Island Bridge for access to a new industrial park which never materialized. Nevertheless, key non-entertainment sectors such as insurance, banking, and the medical school helped to keep the economy viable. Recent history Strand Historic District The economy of the island entered a long, stagnant period. Many businesses relocated off of the island. By 1959, the city of Houston had long out-paced Galveston in population and economic growth. Recognizing this, the Reverend Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese, was permitted by the Vatican to erect a Cathedral of convenience in Houston, naming Sacred Heart Church as co- cathedral. The diocese was then re-designated the Diocese of Galveston- Houston. Galveston and St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica still remained the home of the diocese, but now the bishop could more easily access the rapidly growing Roman Catholic population in Houston. Beginning in 1957, the Galveston Historical Foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings. The 1966 book The Galveston That Was helped encourage the preservation movement. Restoration efforts financed by motivated investors, notably Houston businessman George P. Mitchell, gradually created the Strand Historic District and reinvented other areas. A new, family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years. In September 1961, an F4 tornado generated by landfalling Hurricane Carla hit the city, killing eight and injuring 200. The 1960s saw the expansion of higher education in Galveston. Already home to the University of Texas Medical Branch, the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the Texas Maritime Academy, predecessor of Texas A&M; University at Galveston; and by 1967 a community college, Galveston College, had been formed to help provide affordable education to the community. In the 2000s, property values rose after expensive projects were completedNovak, Shonda. \\"Growth Wave Hits Galveston.\\" Austin American-Statesman. Saturday July 22, 2006. and demand for second homes increased. This led some middle class families to move from Galveston to other areas such as League City, Texas City, and La Marque. The city population remained relatively the same from 2000 to 2005 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2007 The Associated Press compiled a list of the most vulnerable places to hurricanes in the U.S. and Galveston was one of five areas named. Among the reasons cited were low elevation and the single evacuation route off the island which is blocked by the fourth largest city in the United States, Houston. Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island in the early morning of September 13, 2008 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of Ike produced waves and a rising storm surge of about , which went around the famous Galveston Seawall, flooding the city via the storm sewers, and the unprotected \\"bay side\\" of the island, before the first winds or drop of rain. The storm left Galveston without electricity, gas, water pressure and basic communications. The Balinese Room, an historic nightclub, formerly a notorious illegal gambling hall, which was located on a pier extending into the Gulf of Mexico was destroyed in the storm. The island has since re-established services and the population has returned but some damage remains. Discussions are currently under way to build a so-called Ike Dike which would protect Galveston and the bay. the project is still in the conceptual stage and no funding has been allocated. The project was still under discussion in 2017 although the Sierra Club and other environmentalists were warning about the risk to marine life in the area. Several groups were providing their own recommendations on the technical aspects and design of the storm-surge protection system.

He fled from the Nazis three times - from Vienna and Prague in 1938 and from Paris in 1940. Radio broadcaster A master of Austrian slang dialects, Bauer broadcast anti-Nazi news stories in German anonymously through the Austrian Freedom Broadcasting Station in Fecamp, Normandy, in the 1930s and often imitated Adolf Hitler and mocked him in comical news stories. The press called him \\"Rudolph.2\\" He was active in the Austrian anti-Nazi movement against Hitler before World War II, and in 1980 was awarded the Great Silver Order of Honor from the Republic of Austria for Service in the Liberation of Austria. Education Bauer graduated from the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland in 1931; took an M.A. from the College of Economic Sciences in Vienna in 1932; a Doctor Juris degree from University of Vienna Law School in 1933; a diploma in Middle-East Studies from the University of Tehran in 1960; and a master's degree in Middle East Studies from American University in Cairo, Egypt in 1967. He was fluent in German, French and English. Early life Bauer was born in Vienna in 1910, the son and only child of Robert Bauer and Rosa Schwarz. His father was an officer in the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Army and was killed in the final days of World War I, when Bauer was eight years old. That early loss dramatically shaped Bauer's life. Upon graduating with a doctor of law in 1933, Bauer practiced in Vienna from 1935 to 1938. As a student at Vienna University, he became a member of the social-democratic youth movement. After the assassination of Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss by the Nazis in 1934, Bauer became convinced that the only way to fight the Nazis was within the framework of the Vaterlandische Front, the only political organization allowed in Austria at that time. Bauer joined its propaganda office as a volunteer and spoke at international youth conferences in Prague and Paris in 1937. World War II His broadcasting came to Hitler's attention, who placed Bauer on the Nazi's Most Wanted list. On the same day that the Nazis occupied Austria during the Anschluss on March 12, 1938, Bauer boarded a train with one suitcase and left Austria. He never saw his mother again. He fled to Czechoslovakia and joined the Free Austria Movement in Prague, where he worked as a New York Times reporter from 1938-1939, covering the Sudetenland and Carpatho-Ukraine regions. While in Prague, he met Maria von Kahler, (b. 1920) who worried that she and her assimilated Jewish parents, Felix and Lilli von Kahler, would be arrested by the Nazis. The von Kahlers were a wealthy, German-speaking, Austro-Hungarian family who owned sugar beet factories in what was known as Czechoslovakia after 1919. Their Prague home at 18 Under the Chestnuts Street and country chateau, Svinare, were later confiscated by the Nazis, then taken by the Russian communists. After the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia found itself surrounded by Germany on three sides. Nazi Germany invaded the Sudetenland, which formed the natural borders of Czechoslovakia, on Oct. 1, 1938. Bauer and the von Kahlers fled for Paris separately and later met again in Paris, where Maria von Kahler joined him to work for the underground Austrian Freedom Broadcasting Station in Fekamp, Normandy from 1939 to 1940. Bauer was director of the Austrian Freedom station, broadcasting from Normandy until just before France was invaded in the spring of 1940. The station was bombed and destroyed by Germany a few days after they fled. The Bauers and von Kahlers fled France ahead of the German army after the Maginot Line failed in June 1940, joining the same exodus route to Bayonne used by an estimated four million people in cars, bicycles and on foot. The route was featured in the 1942 movie Casablanca. Bauer and Maria von Kahler were married in Portugal in August, 1940 and sailed on the Portuguese steamer SS Quanza immediately afterward to immigrate to the United States. The SS Quanza was the first ship of refugees to flee Nazi Europe. Cincinnati and WLWO After several months of speaking to numerous New York civic organizations about the rise of Nazism in Europe, Bauer was contacted by Crosley Corporation in Cincinnati in mid-1941 and became the German language broadcaster at WLWO in Cincinnati, joining an international staff which broadcast daily shortwave war news from Cincinnati and transmitted them from Mason, Ohio to Europe in English, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French. He and fellow WLWO broadcasters included Giorgio Padovano (Italian) and Edward Beck (French). All three later joined the Voice of America as broadcasters when it was established in 1942. After Pearl Harbor was bombed on Dec. 7, 1941, Bauer was one of several WLWO staff members who took the night train to New York, joining the Voice of America as a broadcaster on the opening day of its operation on Feb. 24, 1942.¬≥ Programming at WLWO was taken over in February, 1942 by the Office of War Information.¬≤ Bauer was German language writer, announcer and producer for the Voice of America from 1942-1944. By 1944, he was chief of the German radio section of the American Broadcasting Station in Europe (ABSIE). On June 5, 1944, at 8 p.m., Bauer was taken to Inveresk House, where he and other broadcasters were sequestered and briefed about the coming Normandy invasion. At about 5:30 a.m. on June 6, 1944, he was taken by jeep to the studio ABSIE shared with the British Broadcasting Corporation, arriving in time for the 6 a.m. broadcast. Bauer was the first announcer in the rotation, so he was the first broadcaster to tell the Germans‚Äîin tolkienesque German‚Äîthat \\"Der Sturm aus dem Westen hat begonnen\\" (The storm from the West has begun).4 The D-Day invasion was the largest land, sea and air invasion in the history of the world, and the Allied victory broke the back of the Nazi regime. Cold War Bauer rose steadily through the ranks of the VOA. He was chief of the Austrian Service and name commentator for the VOA from 1945‚Äì49; chief of the VOA North European Branch in 1949; and chief of the VOA Field Services Division from 1952-1955. He faced Sen. Joseph McCarthy prosecutor Roy Cohn on March 6, 1953, at a U.S. congressional hearing to successfully defend the VOA against accusations that its South American radio program, ‚ÄúEye of the Eagle,‚Äù was Communist. After Bauer's testimony, the VOA was left alone by the McCarthy Commission and Bauer was made head of the VOA European Division, with direct control of radio programming to the Soviet Union and other communist- controlled countries in Europe. Diplomatic career In 1953, Bauer joined the United States Information Agency (USIA) as a radio program manager and during his tours of duty as a U.S. Foreign Service officer served as first secretary for cultural affairs and as counselor for public affairs. He became VOA policy officer in 1956 and was acting television manager for the VOA in 1957. His diplomatic career from 1954 through 1967 took him to U.S. missions in Iran, France, Egypt, and India during seminal historic events, including the Shah of Iran‚Äôs wedding in 1959 and the bombing of the Cairo airport at the beginning of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in 1967. He acted as a Foreign Service Inspector from 1958-1972. In 1972, after retirement, he became an adjunct professor of political science at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, until 1979, and at the American University in Washington, D.C. from 1980 to 1982. He acted as a consultant for the Center for Public Policy Education, the Brookings Institution, from 1982 to 1988. Bauer‚Äôs wife, Maria (n√©e von Kahler), is the author of Beyond the Chestnut Trees, a 1984 memoir of their lives together during World War II. The Bauers have two children, Robert F. Bauer, a Washington D.C. attorney who served as Democratic National Committee, White House Counsel and personal attorney for President Barack Obama, and Virginia Ceaser, also of Washington, D.C.

The \\"Coney Island of Texas\\" was built at a cost of $325,000 and featured a carousel, picnic areas, live entertainment (including diving horses), a dance hall with spring-supported floors, and various mechanical rides, including the Giant Skyrocket roller coaster.David Welling and Jack Valenti, Cinema Houston: From Nickelodeon to Megaplex (University of Texas Press 2007) At night the park (located near 2200 Houston Avenue) was bathed in the light emitted from 50,000 light bulbs. While it was a trolley park, Houston's Luna Park was one of the first amusement parks to offer free automobile parking to its patrons. Grand Opening Located on the banks of White Oak Bayou, Luna Park opened to the public for the first time 26 June 1924. Contemporary press coverage (printed 27 July 1924) stated that the park had ‚Äú‚Ä¶ virtually every variety of amusement device known in the world of showdom.‚Äù Houston‚Äôs first roller coaster,Betty Trapp Chapman, Historic Photos of Houston (Turner Publishing Company 2006) the -tall Skyrocket featured a drop and was billed (with a length of more than 1.25 miles) as the \\"largest\\" and \\"highest\\" roller coaster in the United States at that time. The popularity of the Skyrocket was immense as it carried between 2500 and 3000 passengers daily.The Houstonian:Luna Park In addition, \\"a monstrous seaplane swing also has been installed in the park, as has a caterpillar, a merry-go-round, dodgem, baby airplane swing, junior Ferris wheel, miniature railway and other devices.\\" The scenic railway was reported to be two feet taller than that of Coney Island's. The pavilion was also advertised as the largest in the American South; live entertainment was offered in the form of aerobatics, little people (billed as Williamson's Midget City), and shows entitled \\"See America First\\" and \\"The Mysterious Sensation.\\" Controversy and contention The brief existence of the Houston Luna Park was tumultuous and controversial, from a 1924 lawsuit by a patron who accused park employees of treating her roughly as she was waiting in line for the Skyrocket to claims of discrimination against Mexican people (a police deputy sheriff was arrested for assaulting a Mexican national but was eventually acquitted) to the October 1924 deaths of three people (two were killed from a fall from the Skyrocket; the third was professional parachutist Montie LeMay, who died after her parachute failed to open after attempting a stunt). The following August, the local barber was stabbed while on the Luna Park grounds. Activities in Luna Park In addition to the mechanical rides, Luna Park patrons were offered a variety of activities, including boxing and wrestling exhibitions, dance marathons (with a first prize of $750), beauty pageants, and a variety of outdoor competitions for the entire family. By 1928, the park was observing Mexican Independence Day, with activities organized by the Mexican consulate (including \\"patriotic speeches, patriotic music‚Ä¶ and the reading of the Mexican Declaration of Independence\\"). The success of the dancing marathons prompted the park to schedule (for 1929) a \\"floating marathon\\" in a water tank specially built for the event. Demise The original owners sold the property to a local lawyer (Abe W. Wagner) who held a contest to choose a new name. The eventual winner was Venice Park. He also changed the address to 2212. While the latter half of the 1920s appeared to be the best of times for Luna Park, the 1929 stock market crash was the beginning of a sequence of events that spelled doom for it. People were reluctant to leave home and go to the park after Black Tuesday, and that was not the park's only problem. The misfortunes that marked the first two years of Luna Park's existence returned, first with the discovery of a man's corpse on the park's grounds in 1930; two years later, a farmer was hijacked in his car while in Luna Park. By 1934, the park had closed; the Skyrocket, built and opened in 1925, was moved to a new amusement park nearby, Playland. Since then, the northern and eastern edges of the park's grounds have been occupied by two Interstate highways (I-10 and I-45). The rest of the property is currently occupied by various businesses near a small residential development.

Tradition holds this church shelters the relics of the Saint, leading it to become the center for her veneration and for prayers for her miracles. The original structure of the church dates back to 1300. Only three semicircular apses of the calcareous stone have remained, while the interiors were refurbished in the 18th century. The high altar has a bronze candelabrum (1593). In the 16th century, a polychrome wooden statue of Saint Agrippina was placed on a marble pedestal in the chapel on the right side of the church. The church of Saint Agrippina was rebuilt after an earthquake struck Mineo in 1693. People can still admire the battlemented towers. Since the earthquake, much restoration work has been completed on the church and this includes: * From the 17th century, in the dome of the church, there are four hexagonal columns that are covered in an embossed silver leaf * From the 18th century, a wooden status of the Nativity scene was placed there.

It is considered the nominate subspecies of the longfin dace.  Description  The only other form of fish closely related to Gila longfin dace is the Yaqui longfin dace, which also occurs in Arizona. The body is ‚Äúfusiform,‚Äù meaning that it is spindle-shaped (wide in the middle and tapers at both ends). The scales are small. A typical Gila dace has an average length of 3.5 inches. Their mouths are small and oblique, with a very bluntly shaped snout and head. The nares or outer ‚Äúnostrils‚Äù of the fish direct water toward the gills and define the termination of the mouth. The Gila dace is easily distinguishable from other Cyprinidae by the lack of dark spots normally located on the triangular dorsal fin. However, a large black spot is at the base of the caudal fin. This fish is typically silvery gray dorsally and olive ventrally, with the absence of gold speckles found on its relative, the Yaqui longfin dace.Minckley, W. L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona.

Reproductive biology of longfin dace (Agosia chrysogaster) in a Sonoran desert stream, Arizona. Arizona State University masters thesis. pp. 72. Distribution in Arizona The Gila longfin dace was originally introduced into the Virgin River Basin, the Zuna, and the Mimbres Rivers. This represents the bulk of the range and overall distribution of the fish, with increasing populations around mountainous areas of the Mogollon Rim. This drastic, rapid increase in range is due to vast climate changes within its range. They are generally found at elevations less than 4900 feet, with some scattered outlying records of species above 2030 meters. Habitat The Gila longfin dace has a very wide range of water temperature preferences, being found from low and hot desert streams, to mountain brooks with extremely cold water. They also prefer brooks and streams that have sandy or gravely bottoms, typically with overhanging banks to protect them from being spotted by predators and humans. The fish prefers relatively warmer water, with an average temperature preference of 23.9¬∞C (75¬∞F). They also prefer water depths averaging 0.18 m (0.6 ft). During water shortages, they seek refuge in algae and detritus mats of wetland habitats. Reproduction Gila longfin daces usually spawn during the months of September to December, and can extend this into January in desert habitats. They reach sexual maturity within the first year of birth, and will create depressions in the sand to hide their eggs. This helps them provide a safe place for development, allowing minimal disturbance from other species or predators. Studies have shown a positive correlation between fecundity and fish length, and it is suggested that the same correlation exists between male body length and mating success. Biology Sediment discharge in river bottoms occurs during flooding seasons, and will cause the Gila dace to swim directly into the currents avoiding the spraying of sediment into the gills. If droughts occur, the fish also seek refuge in wetland areas such as algae mats. They can prevent desiccation by hiding under logs and stones. The wetlands provide detritus, a nutrient that these fish primarily eat, as the fish are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders. They can also feed on invertebrates, zooplankton, and other forms of algae as the circumstances allow.

After graduating from high school, Winston moved east to study, graduating from Harvard Law School in 1852. Upon graduation, he moved to New York City and was admitted to the bar of New York State. After practicing law in New York for a year, in 1853, Winston moved to Chicago to launch a law practice there. From 1853 to 1861, Winston partnered with Norman B. Judd, a prominent Republican who nominated Abraham Lincoln at the 1860 Republican National Convention. In 1861, Lincoln appointed Judd as his Minister Plenipotentiary to Berlin, forcing Winston to find a new partner. He then partnered with Henry Williams Blodgett until 1870, when President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant appointed Blodgett to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1865, Winston began a relationship with what would prove to be a long-term client, the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago. Winston later represented three prominent railways: the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, and the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. Winston married Maria G. Dudley, daughter of General Ambrose Dudley. Together, they had six children, including Frederick Seymour Winston, who joined his father's law practice in 1878. Winston retired from active practice in 1885 and devoted time to his support of the Democratic Party. President Grover Cleveland appointed Winston as American Minister to Persia, a position he held only until 1886. Upon his resignation, he traveled in Russia, Scandinavia, and other countries Returning to the U.S. in 1886, he married his second wife, Sallie Reeves Hews, in New Orleans. Following a six-month honeymoon in Europe and Africa, Winston returned to Chicago, and became the president of his former client, the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago. He also became an organizer of the Lincoln National Bank in the later 1880s. During this period, Winston served as president of the Lincoln Park Commission for twelve years. In poor health, Winston retired to Florida in his later years, passing away near Magnolia Springs, Alabama on February 19, 1904.

Distribution  In Arizona, the Yaqui longfin dace only occurs in the southeast, in Cochise County (in both the endorheic Sulphur Springs (Willcox Playa) and R√≠o Yaqui drainages). However, it is also found in northern Mexico, in the Yaqui, Sonora, Mayo, Fuerte and Sinaloa River Basins of Sonora and Sinaloa. The Yaqui longfin dace was re-introduced into the Yaqui River on the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge and the Leslie Creek Wildlife Refuge including West Turkey Creek at Rucker Canyon. The Yaqui longfin dace has the same elevation restrictions as the Gila longfin dace, ranging only below 1484 m, with records of up to 2030 m. They are found in desert scrub to Madrean oak woodlands.  Habitat  The habitat of the Yaqui longfin dace is similar to that of the Gila longfin dace, and it ranges from low and hot desert streams to about 1600 m elevation.Hendrickson, Dean A., W. L.

NatureServe Explorer. 2014. It belongs to the carp family, Cyprinidae. There are three other species in this genus, Campostoma anomalum (the central stoneroller), Campostoma oligolepis (the largescale stoneroller), and Campostoma pauciradii (the bluefin stoneroller), which are morphologically similar.  Description  The Mexican stoneroller has a very stout body with a very large head and snout. The mouth is unique in that its teeth have cartilaginous sheaths, while the size of its mouth is usually very small. The fish's mature length can range anywhere from 3 to nearly 6 inches, however 6 inches is rare, and the average is about 3.5 inches. They have small scales that run along the lateral line, much like the Gila longfin dace and the Yaqui longfin dace. The scales of the Mexican stoneroller can sometimes form arches on its back. Sexual selection has dictated exaggerated male characteristics, which include larger heads and pre-dorsal areas in more successful males. These fish have color patterns with lighter bottoms and darker backs, with a distinct black stripe along the lateral line. They also have a somewhat blotched appearance.Girard, C.

(1973) Fishes of Arizona Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix, Arizona, pages 141-142, Arizona Game and Fish Department (1996 draft) Wildlife of special concern in Arizona Arizona Game and Fish Department Publication, Phoenix, Arizona  Distribution  The Mexican stoneroller has been found as far as south as the Rio Yaqui drainage in Mexico and in tributaries of the Rio Grande near the Big Bend region of Texas. The habitat of the Mexican stoneroller ranges in elevation between 2600 and 6500 feet.  Habitat  The Mexican stoneroller prefers shallow waters near gravel and stone substrates, and larger adults can be found in sandy-bottomed streams. They will use under- covered banks to protect themselves from predators and humans. The biotic community of the fish is primarily the Montane Conifer Forest in the Chiricahua Mountains. They are restricted to higher elevations because of their restricted diet of detritus and algae that thrive in colder waters. Aquatic insects are also part of the fish's diet, if these primary sources are not available due to droughts.  Reproduction  Very few studies of the reproduction of this species have been conducted, leaving a limited amount of information about their patterns. This species is capable of changing the colors on their fins during breeding. The color changes are more dramatic in males, due to sexual selection and female mate choice. The winter and late spring months seem to be the primary times in which the bulk of spawning occurs. Mexican stonerollers use their tubercles as weapons during male-to- male competition, and also to stimulate and attract females. The name stoneroller was given to the genus because males excavate breeding areas by rolling stones with their heads to invite the female. This also helps males defend against their rivals.  Biology and Conservation  The cartilaginous sheaths on their jaws are used for scraping algae and detritus along the gravel and stones within the habitat. An unusual amount of sexual selection has occurred in this species for unknown reasons, and large amounts of energy are expended in male competition and mating success because of this selection. This extra energy is perhaps wasted, and it could be contributing to the decline in fitness and ultimately the disappearance of the species. Populations are declining rapidly in Rucker Canyon along with 'San Bernardino Creek', however numbers in Texas and Mexico remain stable. The Arizona Game and Fish Department gave the species endangered status in 1988, and the Mexican stoneroller still remains on the list. Aquifer pumping, reduction in stream flows, and predation from non-native green sunfish, are all major contributing factors to the decline of the species. The San Bernardino Ranch has current plans to reintroduce individuals in an attempt to recharge the population, and other projects involve federal habitat preservation.

Moore, Anirvan Banerji, and Lakshman Achuthan. Purpose ECRI's stated mission is to preserve and advance the tradition of business cycle research established by Dr. Moore at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the Center for International Business Cycle Research (CIBCR). In contrast to the NBER, ECRI sells cycle risk management services to the business community. International Business Cycle Chronologies Before there was a Business Cycle Dating Committee to determine U.S. business cycle dates, Moore determined them on the NBER's behalf from 1949 to 1978, and then served as the committee's senior member until he died in 2000. Using the same approach, ECRI has long determined recession start and end dates for over 20 other countries that are widely accepted by academics and major central banks as the definitive international business cycle chronologies. History ECRI today represents a third generation of cycle research, building on the work of ECRI's co-founder, Geoffrey H. Moore, and his mentors, Wesley C. Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns. 1920, Wesley C. Mitchell and his colleagues established the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), with a primary objective of investigating business cycles. 1927, Mitchell laid down the standard definition of business cycles: \\"Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes approximating their own.\\" 1929, with the start of the Great Depression, business cycle researchers had a practical emergency on their hands. With the economy back in recession, in the summer of 1937, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. requested Mitchell \\"to draw up a list of statistical series that would best indicate when the recession would come to an end.\\" 1938, Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns identified the first leading indicators of revival. Also in 1938, Geoffrey H. Moore joined Mitchell and Burns at the NBER. 1946, Moore taught Alan Greenspan, who served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006, Statistics 1 at New York University. 1950, Moore developed the first-ever leading indicators of cyclical revival and recession. 1958 to 1967, Moore, working with Julius Shiskin, developed the original composite index method, and the composite indexes of leading, coincident, and lagging indicators of the U.S. economy. 1968, Moore gave over to the U.S. government the original composite leading, coincident and lagging indexes, which the Commerce Department adopted (and published regularly in Business Cycle Developments (BCD), soon renamed Business Conditions Digest), with the Index of Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) becoming its main forecasting gauge. 1969, Moore was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Labor Statistics, and took a four-year leave from the NBER. While Commissioner, he started the collection of additional statistics, including the Employment Cost Index. 1973, Moore and Philip A. Klein began developing international leading indexes. 1979, having retired from the NBER, Moore established the Center for International Business Cycle Research (CIBCR) at Rutgers University, moving it four years later to Columbia University. February 1994, following a surprise rate hike, Chairman Greenspan testifies in Congress that \\"anything that Geoffrey Moore does I follow closely,\\" to which a Congressman replies, \\"No kidding.\\" 1995, Moore received the American Economic Association's Distinguished Fellow Award. 1996, Moore, with his prot√©g√©s, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, established the independent Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), which virtually all of their CIBCR colleagues then joined. ECRI's Approach Many economists claim that recessions cannot be predicted. A 63-country study of economists' predictions conducted by the International Monetary Fund concluded that their \\"record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished.\\" However, The Economist noted in 2005, that \\"ECRI is perhaps the only organisation to give advance warning of each of the past three recessions; just as impressive, it has never issued a false alarm.\\" However, in 2011, ECRI saw a recession that did not materialize (see below). Publicly Available Data The U.S. Weekly Leading Index (WLI) of economic activity. The U.S. Coincident Index (USCI) is a broad measure of current economic activity. International business cycle chronologies for 21 economies. Recession and Recovery Calls 2001 Recession Call: In March 2001, ECRI made a U.S. recession call and in April 2001 ECRI's Achuthan told The Wall Street Journal that \\"the economy has passed the point of no return, beyond which it is not possible to shift away from the recession track.\\" 2007 - 2009 Recession and Recovery Calls: In March 2008, ‚Äúthe Economic Cycle Research Institute, a firm that focuses on identifying peaks and troughs in the business cycle, made its official call on Friday, stating that the U.S. economy had \\"unambiguously\\" entered a recession.‚Äù In April 2009 ECRI said ‚ÄúThe longest U.S. recession in more than a half-century will probably end before the summer is out.‚Äù 2011-12 Recession Forecast: In September 2011, ECRI forecast a U.S. recession that never happened. Growth did slow sharply and was ‚Äúabout as weak as it could be without falling into recession.‚Äù ECRI ‚Äúhad predicted that the final six months of 2012 would register contraction. The first estimate of GDP growth came in at 1 ¬Ω% (that is, at an annual rate of 1 ¬Ω%). The fifth revision to that initial estimate, unveiled in July, pushed down the measured rate of growth to a quarter of 1%, about as close to shrinkage as a positive growth figure can be.\\" 2015: In October 2015, ECRI titled its international cyclical outlook \\"Broader Global Slowdown Ahead\\".International Cyclical Outlook Essentials, Vol. 10, No. 10, October 2015 Specifically, ECRI was predicting the \\"progressively poorer global growth\\" that materialized in early 2016.

Born at Captains Flat in New South Wales to schoolteacher John Filshie and his wife Elizabeth Seaman, she was educated at the local schools, eventually becoming a physical culturist and organiser. On 11 December 1915 in Sydney she married Thomas Mitchell, a stock and station agent, with whom she had one son. They moved to Melbourne, but Thomas was killed in World War I in 1917. She married her second husband, fellow physical culturist Clarence Weber, on 7 March 1919; they had one son and two daughters. Following her husband's death in 1930, she experimented with several occupations, including as a lecturer on health and diet and a Country Party organiser. In 1937, she was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Nunawading, as an independent. She generally supported Country Party Premier Albert Dunstan in the Assembly. She resigned from the Assembly in 1943 to contest the federal seat of Henty in the election of that year; she came fifth in a field of six candidates with 3.9% of the vote, and the seat was won by another independent, Arthur Coles. She contested Box Hill unsuccessfully in 1945 and held various positions subsequently; in 1943 she had been president of the Victorian section of Women for Canberra. From 1950 to 1952 she was organising secretary for the women's section of the Victorian Country Party. After an unsuccessful stint as a guest house operator, she organised for Blind Babies Homes in 1955 and then became organising secretary of the Australian Women's Movement against Socialism. Weber died in 1976 at Camberwell, and was cremated at Springvale Crematorium. She was the first woman elected at a general election in Victoria (Millie Peacock had previously won the seat of Allandale at a by-election), and the first woman in Australia to win a seat as an independent.

Haganah intelligence Be'eri joined the Haganah in 1938 and was in its work battalions, before becoming commander of the Kfar Giladi region. In 1947 he joined Shai, and in February 1948 was appointed its head. On 30 June 1948 Shai was disbanded as part of a reorganization of the Israeli secret service.The History of the ISA Shin Bet Three agencies were created: Shin Bet (Shabak), Mossad and Military Intelligence Directorate, with Be'eri appointed the Director of the latter. Tobianski drumhead court martial Meir Tobianski was a Major in the British army during the Second World War and was a captain in the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Tobianski was working for the Jerusalem Electric Corporation and had knowledge of the exact location of several arms manufacturers in Jerusalem. These factories had received direct hits from Jordanian artillery. On 30 June 1948, Tobianski was taken into custody and interrogated by Be'eri, David Kron, Binyamin Gibli and Avraham Kidron during a drumhead court-martial. Be'eri had already prepared a firing squad consisting of six soldiers from the Palmach Yiftach Brigade, which was in control of the Jerusalem corridor zone. Tobianski was found guilty and executed in Bayt Jiz, where his body was buried. Tobianski had received neither a lawyer nor a right to appeal, and his case was not reviewed by a higher court. Be'eri knew of his innocence, but still ordered his execution.Shabtai Teveth (1996) Ben Gurion's Spy Columbia University Press p 17-30 On 3 July 1949, David Ben-Gurion issued a public exoneration of Tobianski and restitution of his rank and rights. Following Tobianski's posthumous rehabilitation, Be'eri was forced to resign as chief of military intelligence. In November 1949, Isser Be'eri stood trial in the Tel Aviv District Court for Tobianski's wrongful execution. The civilian court found that, as there was a ceasefire in effect at the time, any information supposedly passed by Tobianski could not have served the Jordanian artillery.Nachman Ben-Yehuda (1992), Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice, , p. 266 Be'eri was found guilty of manslaughter and given a symbolic punishment of one day of prison, \\"from sunrise to sunset, 30 days after sentencing\\", before which he was pardoned by the president, Chaim Weizmann. Be'eri reportedly left the trial a broken man and ensconced himself in his home until his fatal heart attack in January 1958. Be'eri's three fellow interrogators, Binyamin Gibli, David Kron and Avraham Kidron, who also were Tobianski's judges in the afternoon field court- martial, were not charged and tried in court. Later they reached high military and civilian positions. Gibli, who had acted as presiding judge, prosecutor, interrogator, witness and record-keeper in Tobianski's court martial, also appeared as a witness for the prosecution in Be'eri's trial. In his memoir, David Kron wrote that despite the official investigation, he was convinced that Tobianski had been guilty and that Be'eri had the full authority to act the way he had. Later Shabtai Teveth placed the fault with Gibli's overbearing ambitions and manipulation, personal traits that led to the Lavon affair.Shabtai Teveth (1996), Ben Gurion's Spy, Columbia University Press, p. 268 See also *1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War *Israeli Security Forces  References  Category:1901 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Bƒôdzin Category:Polish emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Haganah members Category:Israeli military personnel Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:Recipients of Israeli presidential pardons Category:Israeli people of German-Jewish descent Category:Directors of the Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel) ","title":"Isser Be'eri"},{"id":"24684223","text":"Pine Hill Airport is a public use airport located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) southwest of Albion, a village in Orleans County, New York, United States.

The only work attributed to her is the long poem Discourse in Praise of Poetry (Discurso en loor de la poes√≠a), which was printed in Seville in 1608.See Chang-Rodr√≠guez (\\"Gendered\\") 277. She is one of very few female, Spanish-speaking colonial-period poets whose work has not been lost. Thus, she is often read in partnership with Mexico's Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz and fellow Peruvian \\"Amarilis\\", whose identity is also uncertain.See Sabat de Rivers 159. Identity and early life Because she wrote under a pen name, and because no documentation definitively affirms her existence, Clarinda's identity is at best enigmatic. Her gender is itself a source of debate, though literary scholars like Georgina Sabat de Rivers and Raquel Chang-Rodr√≠guez have isolated in Clarinda's poetry what they believe is a distinctly female voice.See Chang-Rodr√≠guez (\\"Clarinda's Catalogue\\") 95. Clarinda was born in the latter half of the 16th Century and was likely a member of the criollo caste, therefore of pure Spanish ancestry, born in the Spanish colonies.See Mora√±a 10. Her writing, which depends heavily on Greek and Biblical allusions, indicates that she was well read and educated. With few exceptions, women under Spanish colonial rule were not encouraged to write, and women who did write typically learned to do so on their own and knowing their work would not find acceptance from the men who dominated the literary tradition.See Sabat de Rivers 113. Fear of rejection or persecution may have been what prompted Clarinda to adopt a pseudonym. However, restrictions on women interested in literature were looser in the colonies than in Europe, and Clarinda seems to have been granted access to the literary circles in colonial Peru. Her writing is characteristic of the Academia Ant√°rtica, a society of poets in Lima who shared and discussed literary texts.See Gonz√°lez Echevarria 201. She may herself have been a member of this society. Discourse in Praise of Poetry Title Page from Mex√≠a de Fernangil's translation of Ovid's Heroides, which includes Clarinda's \\"Discourse in Praise of Poetry\\". Published in 1608 in Seville, Spain. Publication In 1608, Discourse in Praise of Poetry (Discurso en loor de la poes√≠a) was published in the prologue to a new Spanish translation of Ovid's Heroides by the poet Diego Mex√≠a de Fernangil.See Chang- Rodr√≠guez (\\"Clarinda's Catalogue\\") 94. The notes accompanying the poem indicate that its author is a \\"se√±ora principal\\" (foremost lady) in Peru who requested that her work be published under the pen name Clarinda.See P√©rez- Blanco 209 Mex√≠a de Fernangil was a Spaniard but had lived for a time in the viceroyalties of Mexico and Peru,See Chang-Rodr√≠guez (\\"Clarinda's Catalogue\\") 94 and in Lima he was a member of the Academia Ant√°rtica, which perhaps explains Clarinda's association with him.See Gonz√°lez Echevarria 200. Discourse in Praise of Poetry is the only poem credited to Clarinda, though commentators have suggested that it was penned by the same woman who wrote the Ep√≠stola a Bernardo, published in 1621, which is typically attributed to the anonymous poet known as \\"Amarilis\\". As printed in Antonio Cornejo Polar's critical edition, the poem is composed of 269 three-line stanzas and takes as its subject the acclamation of poetry‚Äîwith emphasis on the poetry of Mex√≠a de Fernangil. Cornejo Polar explains in his footnotes that \\"[t]odo el texto tiene como motivo principal alabar la figura de Diego Mexia de Fernangil\\" (the entire text adopts the primary goal of praising the figure Diego Mex√≠a de Fernangil); however, other critics believe the poem's main objective is the insistence that Spanish colonists are just as capable as Europeans of literary invention.See Mora√±a 11. Thus far, no English-language translation of the poem has been published. Sample  In Petrarchan fashion, and following the literary trends of early 17th Century Spanish colonial literature, Clarinda invokes mythological figures, such as Apollo, the Muses, and Orpheus, in her verses: > La mano y el favor de la Cirene, > a quien Apolo am√≥ con amor tierno; > y el agua consagrada de Hipocrene > > y aquella lira con que del Averno > Orfeo libert√≥ su dulce esposa, > suspendiendo las furias del infierno; > > la c√©lebre armon√≠a milagrosa > de aqu√©l cuyo testudo pudo tanto, > que dio muralla a Tebas la famosa; > > el platicar suave, vuelta en llanto, > y en sola voz, que a J√∫piter guardaba, > y al Juna entreten√≠a y daba espanto; > > el verso con que Homero eternizaba > lo que del fuerte Aquiles escreb√≠a, > y aquella vena con que lo ditaba, > > quisiera que alcanzaras, Musa mia, > para que en grave y sublimado verso > cantaras en loor de la poes√≠a. (1-18) > A professional translation into English. From Google Translate:This is a literal translation by Dustin Hixenbaugh, a Ph.D. student in the Comparative Literature Program at the University of Texas at Austin, undertaken solely for the purpose of this article. As stated, no professional translation of the poem has yet been published. > The hand and favor of Cyrene, > whom Apollo loved tenderly; > and Hippocrene's consecrated water > > and that lyre with which, from Avernus, > Orpheus liberated his sweet wife, > suspending the rages of Hell; > > the renowned wonderful harmony > of he whose [testudo] could do so much, > who gave walls to Thebes the famous; > > the smooth conversation, full of weeping, > and in single voice, that protected Jupiter, > and whiled away and frightened Juno; > > the verse that Homer eternalized, > that he wrote for strong Achilles, > and in that vein with which he recited it, > > I would that you arrive, my Muse, > so that in solemn and sublime verse > you will sing in praise of poetry. (1-18) Legacy Clarinda's Discourse in Praise of Poetry has, in the more than three centuries since its publication, become one of Peru's most lauded texts. It is \\"one of the most celebrated products of the Academia Ant√°rtica\\", and it has greatly surpassed in fame the Mex√≠a de Fernangil translation it preceded in its initial publication. Some contemporary scholars view the poem as a fundamental piece in Peru's literary history and an influence on later Peruvian writers like Jos√© Maria Arguedas and Ciro Alegr√≠a.See Clarinda. Cornejo Polar makes this claim in his critical edition of the poem. Feminist responses The fact that Clarinda, probably a woman, composed and even published poetry despite widespread disdain for female writers in colonial Spanish America is typically depicted by feminist critics as a story of personal triumph via autodidacticism. Feminist critics have also endeavored to solidify the interpretation of Discourse in Praise of Poetry as a distinctly female voice, despite the puzzle of Clarinda's true identity. The evidence most commonly put forward in defense of Clarinda's femaleness are the notes that accompany the poem in its first publication (described above).See Chang-Rodr√≠guez (\\"Gendered\\") 279. The poem also catalogues, mostly through allusions, an arresting number of female \\"savants and writers from a variety of traditions and historical periods\\". These include references to Sappho, the Virgin Mary, and many others.See Chang-Rodr√≠guez (\\"Clarinda's Catalogue\\") 98. Many critics interpret this list as Clarinda's attempt to create a space for female voice within the male-dominated genre of colonial lyric poetry. Notes Bibliography * Anderson Imbert, Enrique, ed.

According to the Historia compostelana, he was \\"spirited ... warlike ... of great power ... a man who feared God and hated iniquity,\\" for Diego Gelm√≠rez himself had \\"fed him, like a spiritual son, with the nutriment of holy teaching.\\"Fletcher (1984), 37‚Äì38. Brought up at the court of the Emperor Alfonso VI, Pedro raised the future Emperor Alfonso VII in his household. Around the latter he and Diego formed a \\"Galician party\\" that dominated that region during the turbulent reign of Urraca (1109‚Äì26). In September 1111 they even had the child Alfonso crowned king at Santiago de Compostela, but it was Pedro who was imperator in orbe Galletiae (\\"emperor in the ambit of Galicia\\").Monteagudo Garc√≠a (1952), 490. Pallar√©s and Portela (1993), 833, reads orbem Galletie imperante, \\"ruling the ambit of Galicia\\". Widely travelled and well-connected, especially through the prestigious marriages of his many daughters‚Äîhe had at least sixteen legitimate children by his two wives‚ÄîPedro was, besides a political and military figure, a religious one. Sometime before 1109 he founded the first religious house for women in Galicia. As a result of his generosity to the Cathedral of Saint James in Compostela, Pedro is the best known Spanish nobleman of his era. One modern historian has written that he \\"needs a modern biography, and the materials are adequate for one.\\"Reilly (1982), 360‚Äì62. Most existing coverage is outdated or too heavily reliant on the Historia compostelana. Family The territory ruled by Pedro Fr√≥ilaz directly was the Trast√°mara, that is, the land beyond the river Tambre, just north of Santiago (hatched). Pedro was the son of Froila Verm√∫dez de Traba and his wife, Elvira de Faro.Barton (1997), 278‚Äì79.For Pedro's full, known ancestry, cf. Torres Sevilla-Qui√±ones de Le√≥n (), 304‚Äì305. The first reference to Pedro is from 9 November 1086, when he subscribed to his father's donation to the monastery of San Mart√≠n de Jubia, now Couto.Fletcher (1984), 36. According to the Historia compostelana, Pedro was raised from childhood at the court of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n.Barton (1997), 47‚Äì48. His first wife was Urraca Fr√≥ilaz, daughter of Froila Arias and Ardio D√≠az.For Urraca's ancestry, cf. Torres Sevilla-Qui√±ones de Le√≥n (), 302‚Äì304. They were married sometime before 12 August 1088, although a document surviving only in an eighteenth-century copy records their marriage on 11 August 1102.On that date Urraca comes domnus Petrus in coniugem accepit. By 6 May 1105 Pedro had remarried to Mayor (Guntroda) Rodr√≠guez (de B√°rcena), daughter of Rodrigo Mu√±oz.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1989), 124; Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1991), 23‚Äì24, where she is called Gontrodo Roiz. She had no relation to Ermengol V of Urgell, as sometimes alleged. Cf. also Alonso √Ålvarez (2007), 668. Mayor was a major benefactress of Lugo Cathedral (14 June 1112) and the monasteries of Jubia (26 December 1114) and Sahag√∫n (26 March 1125). She is last recorded alive on 6 January 1129 and probably died not long afterwards. By his first wife Pedro had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Bermudo, would eventually be overshadowed, politically, by the second, Fernando. His other son was Froila and his daughters Jimena and Lupa (married Munio Pel√°ez). By his second wife Pedro had six daughters‚ÄîElvira (married G√≥mez N√∫√±ez), Estefan√≠a, Ilduara (married Arias P√©rez and, as her second husband, the Portuguese nobleman Afonso Egas), Sancha, Toda (married Gutierre Verm√∫dez), and Urraca‚Äîand five sons‚ÄîRodrigo, Garc√≠a, Mart√≠n, Sancho, and Velasco. The assignment of any one of Pedro's children to one of his two wives is in many cases uncertain. The record of the cartulary of the monastery of Sobrado lists only five sons and a daughter without naming a mother, for instance.Quoted in Alonso √Ålvarez (2007), 700: De domno Petro Froyle natus est comes domnus Fernandus et domnus Ueremudus et domnus Garssia et domnus Uelascus et comes domnus Rodericus dictus Uelusu et domna Luba. There may have been a second daughter named Toda who married Gutierre Osorio, from the province of Le√≥n, as well as a daughter named Eva, wife of Garc√≠a Garc√©s de Aza.Fletcher (1984), 41.Alonso √Ålvarez (2007), 668, denies that Eva is a daughter of Pedro and Mayor. This Eva is sometimes identified with a wife of Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara and Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez de N√°jera. The historian Enrique Fl√≥rez named G√≥mez N√∫√±ez as another son-in-law by at the latest 1117.Reilly (1982), 290. Pedro's son Garc√≠a may have married Elvira, illegitimate daughter of Queen Urraca and her lover Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara.The first record of Elvira dates to 1117, cf. Reilly (1982), 217. This marriage would have taken place, if at all, between 1120 and 1126, and would have been designed to reconcile the Galician faction and the court faction. Political career Follower of Raymond of Galicia (1090‚Äì1107) In January 1090 Pedro was governing Ferreira in Galicia and is described in a royal charter as dominator Ferrarie (lord of Ferreira, today part of Coristanco). The only contemporary reference to Pedro which names him in the way by which he is now generally known is an undated fragment of a charter of Alfonso VI, which calls him Petro Froillaz de Traua.Pallar√©s and Portela (1993), 829. It was the thirteenth- century historian Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada some hundred years later who initiated the historiographic tradition, still followed today, which names Pedro and his descendants \\"de Traba\\". His wording‚ÄîComes Petrus de Trava in Gallecia‚Äîmay be derived from the corresponding passage in the Historio compostelana, where Pedro is named Petrus Froylaz Comes de Trava. By 11 January 1096 Pedro had received the title of \\"count\\" (comes in Latin), the highest title bestowed in the kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile. In that year he appealed to the king to intervene to settle a dispute he had with the Abbey of Samos, which the king did.Reilly (1968), 480, surmises that this may indicate a weakening of the authority of Raymond of Galicia at this time. By March 1098 he was governing Traba, from which his family was to derive its recurring toponym. In royal charters he is sometimes called comes de Ferraria (count of Ferreira)E.g. on 21 August 1096. and sometimes comes de Traba (count of Traba).E.g. on 28 March 1098. Pedro was a supporter and vassal of Raymond of Galicia and his wife, Urraca, whom he probably knew from his time in the household of her father, Alfonso VI. Shortly after his birth in 1105, Raymond and Urraca's son, Alfonso Raim√∫ndez, was placed in the care of Count Pedro. It was not uncommon for the scions of noble houses to be raised in others, commonly in those of higher standing. Formation of a \\"Raimundist party\\" (1107‚Äì1109) The monastery of Sobrado was granted to Pedro's eldest two sons in 1118, although already in 1109 Pedro's territory had been defined by it. After the death of Raymond, his widow Urraca donated a Galician monastery to the Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela, signing the charter, dated 13 December 1107, as imperatoris filia et totius gallecie domina. The important Galician bishops of Lugo, Mondo√±edo, Tui, and Ourense, along with Pedro Fr√≥ilaz and the Asturian magnate Suero Verm√∫dez were present to confirm the donation, which was probably designed to secure the support of Diego Gelm√≠rez for Urraca's rule in Galicia.Reilly (1988), 341‚Äì42. In 1107 Pedro also confirmed a royal donation to the monastery of Caabeiro, signing as \\"Count Pedro of Galicia\\", with his two eldest sons beside him, although the comital title (count) and the territorial designation (Galicia) were not directly connected.Comes Petrus de Gallecia. It is not clear whether he was named as Raymond's successor in Galicia by Alfonso VI. The authors of the Historia compostelana certainly did not recognise it, but perhaps for partisan reasons.Pallar√©s and Portela (1993), 833. Beginning in 1109, however, Pedro's power and influence in Galicia was such that he was calling himself \\"Count of Galicia\\" (Gallecie comes), although he did not control the entire province. This had occurred by 22 July, shortly after the death of Alfonso VI and the succession of Urraca, who was his heiress after the death of Sancho Alf√≥nsez at the Battle of Ucl√©s (1108). He continued using this title until 1122.Reilly (1982), 288 n41, cites as the last known reference to this title a document of 22 March 1122. However, contrary to Barton (1997), 278, he cites 29 March 1110 as the first known instance of the title. A judicial document, and thus one not having royal approval in its particulars, dated 1 November 1109 refers to \\"duke Don Pedro Fr√≥ilaz who [is] ruling the nearby territory of Sobrado\\".dux domnus Petrus Froile qui territorio citerio Superaddo imperanti. A royal charter dated 23 May 1121 and calling Pedro a count in maritimis (\\"in the maritime province\\") is probably an accurate description of the realm of his public authority: the Atlantic coastlands of Galicia, specifically those north of the river Tambre and encompassing A Coru√±a.Reilly (1982), 288‚Äì89. It is a sign of his fame that he was referred to as Petro Galliciensi comite (\\"Pedro, Galician count\\") in a letter from William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, to Diego Gelm√≠rez on the occasion of his pilgrimage to Santiago. War with Alfonso the Battler (1110‚Äì1112) ‚ÄúGalicia, behind its mountain shield, had become almost a third power rather than a province, ruled in uneasy alliance by the bishop of Compostela and Count Pedro Fr√≥ilaz. [The queen's] son, Alfonso Raim√∫ndez, was the ward of those two and the ultimate basis of their practical ability to govern there in near independence of her.‚ÄùReilly (1982), 87. When, in the autumn of 1109, Urraca married Alfonso the Battler, the King of Aragon and Navarre, Pedro opposed the marriage, which might have interfered with the succession of Urraca's son by Raymond. Within months of the wedding Pedro had rebelled in Galicia against Urraca's authority. Early in May 1110 Alfonso the Battler entered Galicia with an army. At some point before early July he ravaged the lands of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, but without much effect.Reilly (1982), 66. Our sources for this campaign are the Historia compostelana and the Cr√≥nicas an√≥nimas de Sahag√∫n. Late that summer, a faction of Galicians, led by Pedro with the young Alfonso in tow, visited Urraca at Castrojeriz and there became convinced that she was making peace with her estranged husband. This prompted Pedro to seek the advice of Henry, Count of Portugal, a relative of Raymond of Galicia and the most powerful man in the west of the kingdom.Reilly (1982), 69‚Äì70. On Henry's advice Pedro arrested the partisans of the queen who had journeyed with him and returned to Galicia, where he opened negotiations with the queen. In exchange for the freedom of her supporters she surrendered the castle of Santa Mar√≠a de Castrelo on the Galician border with Portugal. This acquisition secured communication with Henry for the future. In the fall of 1110 Pedro placed his wife, Mayor Rodr√≠guez, and his ward, Alfonso, in his newly acquired castle. One of the queen's supporters, a minor nobleman named Arias P√©rez, attacked suddenly and forced Pedro to retreat, leaving his wife and charge besieged in the castle. Pedro pleaded with Diego Gelm√≠rez to negotiate terms, but no sooner had he done so and the siege had been lifted than Urraca imprisoned Pedro, Diego, Alfonso, and Mayor.Barton (1997), 50‚Äì51. The bishop was soon released so that negotiations could begin with Count Pedro directly. He was released probably in January 1111. On 19 September 1111, Diego and Pedro had the young Alfonso crowned king in Santiago de Compostela.Barton (1997), 14. According to the Historia compostelana, Pedro acted as steward (dapifer) at the coronation festivities.Quoted in Alonso √Ålvarez (2007), 694 n379: Deinde, missa ex more solempniter celebrata, regem nouum deducens ad palatium suum episcopus omnes Gallicie proceres ad regale inuitatuit conuiuium, in quo clarissimus comes Petrus regius dapifer extitir eiusque filius Rudericus clipeum et frameam ad regis scapulas alferecis tenuit. After the coronation, Pedro and Diego gathered an army to subject Galicia to his rule, first attacking Lugo, which was still loyal to Alfonso the Battler.Reilly (1982), 77‚Äì78. They captured it and probably left a detachment there before crossing the mountains in the direction of the capital, Le√≥n. They were ambushed about twenty miles from the city by Alfonso and defeated in the Battle of Viadangos, whereat Pedro was captured.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1984), 45. Diego escaped with the young Alfonso Raim√∫ndez and brought the boy to Urraca in Galicia, marking the first time the queen had physical custody of her son since she began ruling in 1109. Coat-of- arms of Oleiros, showing a castle on the sea. The castle at Oleiros was probably originally built as protection against Vikings and it was granted to Pedro Fr√≥ilaz in 1112. By May 1112 Pedro had been released, possibly in order to cause division among the Galicians, who had gone over to Urraca after Viadangos.Reilly (1982), 81‚Äì85. Urraca was soon forced to recognise Alfonso as her heir and co-ruler, although he was then too young to possess any real power, making the effect of such a concession the increase in power of Pedro and Diego. At about this time, the young Alfonso was put once again in the physical custody of Diego and Pedro in return for their support against Alfonso the Battler. In May 1112, a royal castle at Leyro (perhaps Oleiros) in the north of Nendos was granted to Pedro.Reilly (1982), 268 n49. For the duration of the year 1112, however, no divisions appear among the followers of Urraca, united in their opposition to Alfonso the Battler. Guardian of Alfonso Raim√∫ndez (1112‚Äì1122) Between 1112 and 1122 Pedro served Alfonso Raim√∫ndez in various capacities as a tutor. In the earliest instance, May 1112, he is described by Alfonso's mother, Queen Urraca, as he \\"who raised and nourished my son the lord king Alfonso\\", a fact justified by his being raised at the court of her father, the previous lord king Alfonso.ideo quod pater meus rex dominus Adefonsus uos criauit et nutriauit et pro fideli seruitio uestro quod de uobis cognoui usque in hunc diem et quod criastis et nutristis filium meum regem dominum Alfonsum. On 5 July 1118, in a document from Celanova, Alfonso is called a clientulus (\\"little dependent\\") of Pedro.This document is published in S√°nchez (1944), 188‚Äì89. As late as 22 March 1122 Alfonso was still referring to Pedro as regis altor (royal protector). It was around this time, in 1121 or 1122, that Pedro made a final peace with his old enemy, Arias P√©rez, by marrying to him his own daughter Ildaria.Probably reluctantly, considering the different social strata of the two families thus united, cf. Barton (1997), 51. By 1121 Pedro's second son, Fernando, was already a count, because of his influence at the court of Theresa, Countess of Portugal. On 25 July 1122, Pedro's eldest son, Vermudo, made over the bridewealth to his wife Urraca Enr√≠quez, daughter of Theresa of Portugal.The carta de arras is edited in Barton (1997), 308‚Äì10. This marriage was contracted through Fernando and the bridewealth was given to Vermudo by his father for that express purpose.Barton (1997), 54. At some point early in the century Pedro gave a Moorish cook named Mart√≠n to Fernando.Barton (1997), 59‚Äì60. This has been taken to indicate Pedro's \\"taste for Moorish cooking\\". In July 1114 Urraca ventured into Galicia with the intention of depriving Diego of his secular powers. In this she was joined by Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, Munio Pel√°ez, Suero Verm√∫dez, Guter Verm√∫dez, and Rodrigo V√©laz, but not by her son.Reilly (1982), 98‚Äì99. A contemporary charter records that \\"the queen Do√±a Urraca reigning with her son Don Alfonso in the kingdom of Spain [and] discord also remaining between them.\\"regnante regina domna Urraca cum filio suo donno Adefonso in espanie regno discordia tamen inter eos manente. The conspiracy against Diego is mentioned in a royal charter of 23 July, in the Historia compostelana, and in a private document of the Cathedral of Le√≥n (26 July). Diego and Pedro were not always on good terms, with the Historia compostelana accusing of Pedro of depredating the Galician church and at times even robbing the poor.Barton (1997), 218. In July 1114, however, Pedro changed his mind and supported Diego. After Diego successfully defended himself from Urraca's charges, the queen left Compostela for Salnes, planning to kidnap Diego at Iria Flavia. The archbishop was warned in a secret message from Pedro and evaded the queen's men. Negotiations were then opened and the queen, Pedro, Mu√±o, and Rodrigo all swore oaths to respect the rights of the archdiocese to its tenancies. Pedro and Alfonso against Diego and Urraca (1116‚Äì1118) In March or April 1116 Pedro was fighting along with Alfonso Raim√∫ndez in the region around Toledo on behalf of Urraca.The Historia compostelana reads: puerum commorantem in Extremitatem Comes P. Froylaz. Through this he learned of a plot by the queen to have the archbishop seized and for a second time duly forewarned him.Reilly (1982), 109‚Äì11. Pedro and Alfonso promptly returned to Galicia and raised the standard of revolt. Urraca marched via Triacastela and Mellid, the route usually taken by pilgrims to Compostela, into Galicia, gaining many supporters on the way. Surprisingly, the citizens of Compostela were prepared to fight for her against their lord, Diego, and his allies. The rebels were forced to abandon the capital of Galicia to Urraca, who hastily arranged a new alliance with Diego. Castle of Sobroso, where Pedro surprised and besieged Queen Urraca. On 18 May 1116 Urraca granted Diego a charter that was subscribed by Pedro, indicating that at least initially he too was drawn into the alliance with the queen. But when Urraca campaigned against G√≥mez N√∫√±ez, whose lands guarded the roads into Portugal from Galicia, she was surprised and besieged in Sobroso by Pedro in alliance with the Countess Theresa. The queen was forced to retreat to Compostela and thence to Le√≥n. Pedro's breach with Urraca mirrored a temporary change in his relations with Diego. Not perfectly respecting his oath to the archbishop, in 1116 Pedro was chased by Diego from the territories of his archiepiscopal lordship into the mountains around Deza.Barton (1997), 213. The Historia also records that he led raids to scoff serfs and cattle.Barton (2000). In the autumn of 1116 Urraca held court at Sahag√∫n and there opened negotiations with the party of her son Alfonso, led by Diego and Pedro. The only secure date for these negotiations comes from a charter of 15 October, which the queen issued from Sahag√∫n.Reilly (1982), 114‚Äì17. Urraca was able to draw her son Alfonso at least temporarily out of the orbit of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz and Diego Gelm√≠rez by granting him the Kingdom of Toledo as an appanage. By November, when Alfonso was twelve years old, he had entered Toledo to rule it. The Historia compostelana also claims that Urraca conceded to her son, and by implication to his guardians, the rule of Galicia, although there is no documentary evidence of this. It seems especially unlikely in light of the apparent weakness of Diego and Pedro's alliance at the time, and the lack of support for them in Santiago de Compostela itself. In the spring of 1117, probably in June, Urraca, after campaigning against Theresa in southern Galicia, came to Santiago to mediate between Diego and the council (concejo), which had been ruling the town de facto for the past year.Reilly (1982), 124‚Äì25. During a private meeting between Urraca and Diego in the episcopal palace, the townspeople revolted and forced the two to take refuge in a cathedral tower then under construction, which they promptly lit on fire. When the queen came out she was seized by the mob, stripped, and pelted with stones before certain moderates rescued her. Extracting from her promises of amnesty, they freed her to leave the city. She and Diego‚Äîwho had managed to escape unscathed‚Äîthen joined the army that had assembled under Pedro Fr√≥ilaz and Alfonso. On seeing the approach of Pedro's forces the town surrendered. Its leaders were exiled and their properties confiscated. The town was assessed an indemnity and the rule of the archbishop was restored. Final war with Urraca (1120‚Äì1123) Pico Sacro (\\"sacred peak\\"), where Urraca camped her army to threaten Santiago In the years 1118‚Äì19, Pedro Fr√≥ilaz is revealed in the surviving documents of the period to have been the most important lay supporter of the royal prerogative and the imperial pretensions of Alfonso Raim√∫ndez.Reilly (1982), 125‚Äì144. In the spring of 1120 Urraca returned to Galicia and formed a tenuous military alliance with Diego against certain supporters of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz. The local campaigning was a success.Reilly (1982), 145. During the subsequent campaign against Theresa of Portugal, however, Urraca had imprisoned Diego and attempted to assert her authority in his lordship directly. At that juncture her son left her camp and joined that of Pedro in the vicinity of Santiago. This incited some citizens to riot in support of Diego, and Urraca was forced to release him on 28 July 1120, although she would not restore his secular authority.Reilly (1982), 146‚Äì47. The archbishop then enlisted the aid of Pedro, Alfonso, and Theresa. In the fall the queen was forced to concede the fiscal lands around Sahag√∫n to her son's direct rule.Reilly (1982), 151. In 1121 Urraca confiscated the secular lordship of the archbishop of Santiago, including his fortresses and castles. This led to a dispute with the papacy, and Pope Calixtus II sent letters to the queen threatening excommunication.Reilly (1982), 155‚Äì56. Negotiations between the monarch and the bishop were reopened, but they were soon broken off and Urraca gathered an army and invaded Galicia. She marched to the castle of Cira, thence to Tabeiros and Salnes, and finally camped at the mount of Picosacro, close by Santiago de Compostela. Archbishop Diego and Count Pedro raised an army and fought a few skirmishes, but the prelate soon arranged a peace. A royal document of 23 May records Urraca in obsidione super Acromonte (\\"in siege above Acromonte\\"), probably a reference to Picosacro. It indicates that, contrary to the testimony of the Historia compostelana, Alfonso Raim√∫ndez was then with his mother's forces, not those of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz. Diego was able ultimately to force the return of his church's lands, and probably Pedro received an equally favourable settlement from the queen.Reilly (1982), 158. He was with the queen on 22 March 1122, when she confirmed Alfonso's donation of the monastery of San Mart√≠n de Pinario to the church of Compostela,Reilly (1982), 166. and was with her again on 8 March 1123 at Lugo, with most of the Galician high nobility.Reilly (1982), 174‚Äì75. Sometime after this, and perhaps before she came to an understanding with Diego on 27 March, Queen Urraca had Pedro arrested and imprisoned along with his sons. Her exact motive is unclear, although his fiefs were confiscated.Barton (1997), 112. Pedro remained a royal prisoner at least until Urraca's death, and his sons continued to support her enemy, Theresa of Portugal.Reilly (1982), 191‚Äì92. The Chronicon iriense, a history of the diocese of Santiago de Compostela, may have been written between the years 1121, when Pedro and the Galician magnates were forced to swear oaths to Bishop Diego, and 1123, when Pedro and his sons were imprisoned by the queen. On this account, the Chronicon was designed to bolster Diego's claims by a recourse to the history.Isla Frez (1984), 430. Apse of the monastery of Jubia, a major beneficiary of Pedro's religious patronage and which he eventually gave to Cluny. Religious patronage Pedro was a major patron of Benedictine monasticism and of the Cluniac reform. He made donations to Jubia,On 12 August 1088, 14 December 1113, 27 February 1125. Neme√±o,On 6 May 1105. and Pedroso.On 25 March 1126. On 14 December 1113 Pedro and his siblings granted Jubia to the Abbey of Cluny. There are also three suspicious donations recorded to the regular clergy of Caabeiro.Dated 25 July 1086, 24 June 1092, and 6 April 1108. The last he signs as Ego comes Petrus, principis Gallecie, una cum uxore mea comitissa (\\"I, Count Pedro, prince of Galicia, together with my wife the countess\\"). Sometime in the early 1120s, persuaded by Diego Gelm√≠rez, Pedro granted the church a Cospindo near Traba to the archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela.Barton (1997), 188. His other benefactions to the see were so numerous that the author of the Historia compostelana refused to list them all. The motive behind this generosity was Pedro and his second wife's desire to be buried in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.Barton (1997), 207. Pedro is also known to have made donations to the diocese of Mondo√±edo, to the immediate east of his domains. The Historia compostelana records that there were no nunneries in Galicia around the year 1100.Fletcher (1984), 35. This was rectified by Pedro Fr√≥ilaz sometime before 1108. The monastery of Cines (Cinis), long abandoned, he had recently resurrected as a community of nuns. Early in 1108, with papal and episcopal support, a certain Abbot Nu√±o (Munio), with a community of monks, expelled the ladies and re-established a monastery there. Pedro in turn removed the men and in their place re-installed the women. These may have included two of his three known sisters. Visclavara, who never married and was a prolific religious donor‚Äîto Jubia, Cines, Carboeiro, and the cathedral of Santiago‚Äîwas still in secular life in 1097, but was described as a \\"handmaid of the handmaids of God\\" (ancillarum Dei ancilla) in 1114. The other sister, Munia, is consistently called \\"vowed to God\\" (Deo vota) in the sources. She lived until 1145 and was also a donor to Jubia. The removal of the monks of Cines provoked a controversy which was eventually brought before Pope Paschal II. Initially he was persuaded by the expelled monks and sent a letter dated 1 May 1109 to the bishops of Compostela, Mondo√±edo, and Lugo ordering them to protest Count Pedro's actions.Garrig√≥s (1943), 393‚Äì94. A second letter was sent to Bernard de Sedirac, the apostolic legate, at the same time. Pedro responded by making a pilgrimate to Rome with the archives of the monastery of Cines to plead his case before the curia Romana.Barton (1997), 211. There he persuaded Paschal that the monastery was a family possession. Paschal sent a new letter to Bernard and Diego, dated 11 April 1110, ordering them to re- establish the women at Cines.L√≥pez Sangil, \\"La fundaci√≥n,\\" 14. Death Pedro's relationship to the monastery of Caabeiro is perhaps somewhat falsified in the surviving documents, but a document from here is one of the last records of Pedro (1125) and the only one that names his countship as Trast√°mara, that is, the lands beyond (tras) the Tambre (T√°mara). Pedro is not recorded in any royal document after his imprisonment in 1123. His wife does name him as co-donor of the Tresancos and N√©mitos to Jubia on 27 February 1125.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1991), 35. A document of Caabeiro, dated 1125, refers to Pedro as count in Trast√°mara, a title his descendants would frequently bear.in Trastamar comite Petrus Froylaz. Pedro is last recorded in a document dated 25 March 1126. On 3 May his widow made a donation to the monastery of Sahag√∫n for the sake of his soul, possibly indicating that he had died in the interim. The Historia compostelana records that Pedro made a division of his properties amongst his heirs on his deathbed, with the consent of his wife and children, although no written record of this division has survived.Barton (1997), 57. Several modern sources date Pedro's death to 1128, but few give reasons.Reilly (1982), 192 n45. The deathbed munificence of Pedro in favour of the see of Compostela, which is recorded in the Historia compostelana, has been dated to 1128. The historian Richard A. Fletcher has noted how well-travelled and well-connected Pedro was for a nobleman of his time: \\"His upbringing at the peripatetic court of Alfonso VI must have familiarized him with most corners of the kingdom of Le√≥n-Castile; he had spent some time in captivity in Aragon; [and] he numbered among his acquaintances the princes of southern France.\\" He was buried in the cathedral of Compostela, where his tomb, surmounted by an effigy carved in stone, still lies in the \\"Chapel of Relics\\". In the central plaza of Compostela, he had once had an iron statue of himself put up, which does not survive. Notes Bibliography *R.

Political career Moore ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district of Smoky River to pick it up for the Progressive Conservatives who would go on to form government in that election. The race for Smoky River was hotly contested with all three candidates splitting roughly a third of the vote. Moore ran for a second term in the 1975 Alberta general election. For the second time in a row he faced off against New Democrat challenger Victor Tardif. This time Moore won a solid majority to hold the district. After the election Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Moore to his first portfolio in the Executive Council. Moore would take of as Minister of Agriculture from Hugh Horner. He ran for re-election to his third term in the 1979 Alberta general election. His vote popularity would take a hit, but he still retained his seat by a wide margin. After the election Lougheed shuffled the cabinet. Moore became the new Minister of Municipal Affairs. He would run for his fourth term in office in the 1982 general election. Moore would see a modest rise in his popular vote. The opposition vote split evenly between the New Democrat and Western Canada Concept candidates. He would be easily reelected on the split vote. After the election Moore was shuffled to his third portfolio. This time as the Minister of Transportation. He kept his portfolio after Don Getty became premier in 1985. Moore would run for his final term in office in the 1986 general election. He would win the highest popular vote of his political career defeating three other candidates. Moore would be shuffled by Getty to his final portfolio and he became Minister of Hospitals and Medical Care serving until 1988. Moore retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the assembly in 1989.

Underhill. 1978. How to know the freshwater fishes, third edition. Wm. C. Brown Company, Dubuque, IA.  Description  The bluehead sucker is the largest of all Arizona endemic suckers, reaching lengths over 11.8 in. Their colors are very similar to the desert sucker, with dark green or dark silvery top portions and light yellow bottoms. The bluehead has the largest lips of any sucker and has tiny papillae on the lower lip. This is also the only species with the absence of an inguinal process, just behind the pectoral fins, distinguishing it from the other eight suckers. The lower lip is slightly notched at the midline, with lateral line scales in large numbers that range from 70 to 100. They have 7 to 9 dorsal fin rays and a smaller number of caudal fin rays. During breeding, the males obtain a blue patch on the top of their large heads, and the lower fins become yellow/orange with red/rosy lateral lines. These drastic coloration changes are probably due to sexual selection and female mate choice. An easy way to distinguish the bluehead from the other Arizona suckers is the distinct cartilaginous lower jaw.  Distribution in Arizona  Primary records are concentrated at the Colorado River main stem and the Grand Canyon tributaries, as well as the Colorado River drainages at Lake Mead. Blueheads are also found at Snake River above Shoshone Falls and Bear/Weber River drainages. Scattered reports around the Bonneville Basin have been made. Arizona bluehead sucker distributions are more specifically the Clear, Bright Angel, Shinumo, Kanab, and Havasu Creeks, rarely below Diamond Head. Some can be found near the Navajo Reservation and the San Juan drainage. Their biotic communities are restricted to aquatic wetland and riparian zones within Arizona, with a more restricted elevation distribution of 609 to 2060 m.  Habitat  Bluehead suckers prefer larger streams and rivers due to their larger size, but they can be found in a variety of habitats.(Sublette et. al. 1990). This species has a wide temperature preference, as well, ranging from cold mountain brooks at 12¬∞C to warmer desert rivers at 27¬∞C. If times are good and water is clear, the suckers stay in shallow steams and eddies during the day, finding their way to hard-bottomed streams to forage at night. Primary spawning areas include a high concentration of juvenile minnows in the Grand Canyon tributaries and Colorado River drainages. Populations will remain stable unless humans destroy habitats.  Reproduction  The bluehead sucker has unique spawning techniques, which make it different from most of the other Arizona native fish. Arizona fish usually mate and breed during the winter, due to specific physiological parameters and water temperature preferences. The bluehead sucker is the opposite, preferring the spring/summer and much warmer water temperatures, exceeding 15.72¬∞C. Males join females in gravel/sandy-bottomed streams and copulation begins, taking only a few seconds. In the Grand Canyon tributaries, mating can extend even later into the year through April, May, and July. This species will not mate unless the water depth is strictly lower than 1 m, probably because the shallow water is easily heated to their desired temperature by the sun. Juveniles grow exponentially fast, reaching lengths of 60 mm and sexual maturity within the first year.  Biology  Suckers use their cartilaginous jaws to scrape the algae and detritus off the stones at the bottom, and despite any shortages of these foods, suckers show little seasonal movement. Diatoms, detritus, algae, and other organic debris have been found in the gut. They are unique in that they are the only members of the genus to hybridize with other members of the same genus, increasing gene flow among species. They can also live to be more than 20 years old.

Las, qu'i non sun sparvir, astur (), which translates \\"Oh, to be a sparrow- hawk, a goshawk!\\", is the incipit of an anonymous Old Occitan cobla (single stanza poem). It was found in the margins of an eleventh-century manuscript in the British Library. Possibly it was added late in that century, certainly by a German scribe. It was first published in 1984, and has been translated into French and English. In the poem the lover expresses erotic desire and the longing for fulfillment through his wish to be a sparrow hawk or, which was more prized, a goshawk so that he could fly to her. In the Middle Ages, the value of a sparrow hawk was proportional to its resemblance to the goshawk in size, strength and beauty. The symbolism of the male lover as hunting bird reoccurs in the troubadour lyricBernart Marti, Bel m'es lai latz la fontana (I like it near the fountain). and in the Middle High German Minnesang,Der von K√ºrenburc, Ich z√¥ch mir einen falken (I trained a falcon). beginning a century later. The apposition of joy (joi) and grief (dolor) would become a mainstay of the troubadours. Notes Bibliography *Pierre Bec. \\"Pr√©troubadouresque ou paratroubadouresque?

These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The word \\"robot\\" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel ƒåapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term \\"robotics\\" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story \\"Liar!\\"According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \\"robotics\\" was first used in the short story \\"Liar!\\" published in the May, 1941 issue of Astounding Science Fiction.  Nature of robotics  Robotics can be described as: * An applied science - scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. ** A branch of computer science - ** A branch of electrical engineering - ** A branch of mechanical engineering - * Research and development - * A branch of technology -  Branches of robotics  * Adaptive control - control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions. * Aerial robotics - development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Their flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. * Android science - interdisciplinary framework for studying human interaction and cognition based on the premise that a very humanlike robot (that is, an android) can elicit human-directed social responses in human beings. * Anthrobotics - science of developing and studying robots that are either entirely or in some way human-like. * Artificial intelligence - the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. * Artificial neural networks - a mathematical model inspired by biological neural networks. * Autonomous car - an autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the human transportation capabilities of a traditional car * Autonomous research robotics - * Bayesian network - * BEAM robotics - a style of robotics that primarily uses simple analogue circuits instead of a microprocessor in order to produce an unusually simple design (in comparison to traditional mobile robots) that trades flexibility for robustness and efficiency in performing the task for which it was designed. * Behavior-based robotics - the branch of robotics that incorporates modular or behavior based AI (BBAI). * Bio-inspired robotics - making robots that are inspired by biological systems.

Biography J. Graham Parsons was born in New York City on October 28, 1907. He was educated at Groton School, graduating in 1925, and Yale University, receiving his B.A. in 1929. Upon graduation, he entered the United States Foreign Service, and served from 1932 to 1936 as private secretary to Joseph Grew, United States Ambassador to Japan. In 1934, he was on a train in the far north of China in which he survived a shootout between guards and bandits. He left Japan in 1936, upon being promoted to vice consul, holding that position first in Cuba, then in Manchuria, then in Canada. Parsons spent 1943-47 at the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C. as part of the British Commonwealth Affairs Section. Parsons returned to the field in 1947 as assistant to Myron Charles Taylor, the Personal Representative of the President of the United States to the Vatican, a post he held until 1948. He then spent 1948-50 as Consul in the American Embassy in New Delhi and Kathmandu. Returning to the U.S. in 1950, Parsons was posted at the National War College, and then in 1951 became Deputy Director of the State Department's Office of European Regional Affairs. In 1953, he returned to Japan, serving as Minister and deputy chief of mission in Tokyo until 1956. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Parsons as United States Ambassador to Laos, head of the U.S. embassy in Vientiane, with Parsons presenting his credentials on October 12, 1956. As ambassador to the Kingdom of Laos in the midst of the Laotian Civil War, Parsons is identified with the Eisenhower administration's support of the Royal Lao Government against the Pathet Lao. His mission to Laos ended February 8, 1958. Parsons continued to support the administration's Laotian policy in 1959-61, during which time he served as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. (He assumed office on July 1, 1959, and relinquished office March 30, 1961.) Testifying to the United States Congress in March 1961, Parsons said \\"the responsibility of the United States in Laos is indeed a very great one, and I hope there will be no misunderstanding of our firmness and steadiness.\\" In his 1965 book A Thousand Days, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. was highly critical of Ambassador Parsons' approach to Laos (Schlesinger favored American neutralism between the royalists and the rebels), saying that Parsons \\"drastically misconceived the situation\\". Parsons never publicly responded to this or other similar criticisms. President Kennedy and other ambassadors in March 1961 On March 15, 1961, President John F. Kennedy named Parsons United States Ambassador to Sweden, heading up the embassy in the Diplomatstaden, Stockholm. Closely identified with American policy towards Southeast Asia, Parsons became the focus of criticism in Sweden as Swedish opposition to the United States' role in the Vietnam War mounted throughout the 1960s. Parsons left his post as Ambassador to Sweden on April 17, 1967, and less than a year later, his successor, William Womack Heath, was recalled to protest the participation of Swedish education minister Olof Palme in an anti-Vietnam War protest. The U.S. would not appoint a new ambassador to Sweden until 1970. Parsons served as deputy chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks from 1970 until he retired from the Foreign Service in 1972. In his later years, Parsons lived in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and he died while visiting friends in Lyme, Connecticut on October 20, 1991. Parsons married Margaret Josephine Boulton in 1936. She died in 1987. Together they had two daughters, Margaret and Jane. External links * The J.

The approach builds on the strengths of proven budgeting approaches, leverages the respective advantages for situations of fluctuating incomes, and at the same time reduces possible negative impacts.  Summary  The core idea of conditional budgeting is to structure income and expenditures according to probabilities and priorities respectively. After the budget is approved, the actual status of the finances is reviewed and analyzed regularly, and if income reaches a certain level (or probability), the corresponding level of expenses is approved. Therefore, conditional budgeting does not focus on spending a certain amount of money or consuming certain resources; rather, it defines priorities of expenses and resources as well as income and earning levels that will allow releasing the funds for expenses and resource consumption.  Background  While different understandings of budgeting exist, for the purpose of this article budgeting shall be understood as the implementation of the long-term plan for the year ahead. Because of the shorter planning horizon budgets are more precise and detailed. Budgets are a clear indication of what is expected to be achieved during the budget period whereas long-term plans represent the broad directions that are intended to be followed.Smith, Julia; Handbook of Management Accounting, Fourth Edition; Oxford, CIMA Publishing, 2007; p. 137  Traditional line item budgeting  The traditional budgeting approach develops a plan within the context of ongoing business and it is ruled by previous decisions that have been taken within the long-term planning process. Budgeting may serve different functions such as: forcing managers to plan ahead and therewith reducing ad hoc decisions; communicating objectives, perceived problems and opportunities, as well as the role that everyone is expected to play; coordinating the separate activities and ensuring that all parts of the organization are in mutual harmony; aiding motivation through setting targets and providing a challenge; or providing standards which can be employed as part of the control process.Smith, Julia; Handbook of Management Accounting, Fourth Edition; Oxford, CIMA Publishing, 2007; p. 138 To establish a budget, Smith suggests the following six steps:Smith, Julia; Handbook of Management Accounting, Fourth Edition; Oxford, CIMA Publishing, 2007; p. 140 * communicating details of budget policy and guidelines to those people responsible for the preparation of budgets * determining the factor that restricts output * preparation of the sales budget * initial preparation of various budgets * final acceptance of budgets * monitoring of actual results against the budget. The traditional budgeting approach, also called line-item budget, normally consists of a set of several budgets that build on one another and have to be integrated. For a manufacturing company, these budgets may be:Drury, Colin; Management and Cost Accounting, 7th Edition; London, Cengage Learning, 2008; p. 363 * sales budget * production budget * direct materials usage budget * direct materials purchase budget * direct labor budget * factory overhead budget * selling and administration budget * cash budget. This approach typically builds on the previous year sales and cost structure and it works fine for unit level costs where the consumption of resources varies proportionately with the volume of the final output of products or services. Such approaches are also called incremental budgeting.Drury, Colin; Management and Cost Accounting, 7th Edition; London, Cengage Learning, 2008; p. 371  Activity-based budgeting (ABB) While basing the budget on previous effective costs figures, and therewith accepting the cost of non-unit level activities to be fixed, and consequently inherent past inefficiencies and waste in the current way of doing things, activity- base budgeting allows to manage costs more effectively. Adopting the underlying ideas of activity-based costing (ABC), ABB authorizes the supply of only those resources that are needed to perform activities required to meet the budgeted production and sales volume. In this budgeting process, cost objects are the starting point and their budgeted output determines the necessary activities which are then used to estimate the resourced that are required for the budget period. The process stages are: * estimate the production and sales volume by individual products and customers * estimate the demand for organizational activities * determine the resources that are required to perform organizational activities * estimate for each resource the quantity that must be supplied to meet the demand * take actions to adjust the capacity of resources to match the projected supply.  Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) Zero-based budgeting, also known as priority-based budgeting, emerged in the late 1960s as an attempt to overcome the limitations of incremental budgets.- This approach requires that all activities are justified and prioritized before decisions are taken relating to the amount of resources allocated to each activity. ZBB typically also focuses on activities instead of functional departments.Drury, Colin; Management and Cost Accounting, 7th Edition; London, Cengage Learning, 2008; p. 375 Zero-based budgeting involves the following three stages:Drury, Colin; Management and Cost Accounting, 7th Edition; London, Cengage Learning, 2008; p. 376 * description of each organizational activity in a decisions package * evaluation and ranking of decision packages in order or priority * allocation of resources based on order of priority up to the spending cut-off level.  Criticism of budgeting  The major criticism of the traditional annual budgeting approach is that the process is incapable of meeting the demands of the competitive environment in the information age. The specific criticism points are:Drury, Colin; Management and Cost Accounting, 7th Edition; London, Cengage Learning, 2008; p. 377 * encouraging rigid planning and incremental thinking * being time- consuming * producing inadequate variance reports leaving the 'how' and 'why' questions unanswered * ignoring key drivers of shareholder value by focusing too much attention on short-term financial numbers * being a yearly rigid ritual * tying the company to a 12-month commitment, which is risky since it is based on uncertain forecasts * meeting only the lowest targets and not attempting to beat the targets * spending what is in the budget even if it is not necessary in order to guard against next year's budget being reduced * achieving the budget even if this results in undesirable actions. Steven Bragg adds that the typical budget process requires a large number of iterations and many meetings by the management team before a satisfactory budget is created. This is not an efficient use of managers' time, since they must meet many times to make incremental changes to the budget and then wait for the budget team to process the changes and give the results back to them.Bragg, Steven; Just-in-time accounting: how to decrease costs and increase efficiency; New York: Wiley Publishing, 2001; p. 276 Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electrics, concludes that the budgeting process at most companies has to be the most ineffective practice in management. It sucks the energy, time, fun, and big dreams out of an organization. It hides opportunity and stunts growth. It brings out the most unproductive behaviors in an organization, from sandbagging to settling for mediocrity. In fact, when companies win, in most cases it is despite their budgets, not because of them.Welch, Jack; Winning; New York: Harper Business, 2005; p. 189 Jack Welch instead imagines a system of budgeting where both the field and headquarters have a shared goal: to use the budgeting process to ferret out every possible opportunity for growth, identify real obstacles in the environment, and come up with a plan for stretching dreams to sky; not being internally focused and based on hitting fabricated targets, but throwing open the shutters and look outside. Such a budgeting system must be focused on two questions:Welch, Jack; Winning; New York: Harper Business, 2005; p. 197 * How can we beat last year's performance? * What is our competition doing, and how can we beat them? Other alternative approaches include: Rolling Forecasts / Rolling Budgets: A rolling budget is a budget or plan that is always available for a specific future period by adding a month, quarter or year in the future as the month, quarter or year just ended is dropped. Thus, a 12-month rolling budget for March 2008 to February 2009 period becomes a 12-month rolling budget for the April 2008 to March 2009 period the next month, and so on. There is always a 12-month budget in place. Rolling budgets constantly force management to think concretely about the forthcoming 12 months, regardless of the month at hand.Bhimani, Alnoor; Horngren, Charles; Datar, Srikant; Foster, George; Management and Cost Accounting; Essex: Prentice Hall, 2008; p. 473 Flexible Budgets: The concept of flexible budgets is an extension of the traditional budgeting methodology that is most valuable when the company expects or any experience wide variations in levels of activity within some area of the company, such as sales, or if many of the costs vary directly with those levels of activities, e.g. they are direct costs tied to sales, and the budget controls for these costs would be marginally useless if activity levels were significantly different from those in the budget. In such situations, direct costs are budgeted for various levels of activity and the budget used for a comparison with actual results is the budget that is based on the actual activity levels achieved.Siciliano, Gene; Finance for the non-financial manager; New York: McGraw-Hill Companies, 2003; p. 166 Beyond Budgeting: Beyond Budgeting, promoted by the international movement Beyond Budgeting Round Table, advocates the replacement of the traditional budgetary control system with an assortment of 'adaptive processes'. These are planning and decision-making processes which are not strictly part of the traditional budgetary control system. Such a new budget system would show summary figures of sales, costs, profits and cash flow, which enables managers to review the financial outlook of the business without being constrained by the corporate financial year used for the annual reporting cycle. This removing of the traditional budget process must be accompanied by the removal of fixed performance contracts and therefore organizations are able to change the attitudes and behaviors of people at every level of the organization, incl. eradicating the undesirable behaviors that result from setting a fixed target that must be met even though the outcome is highly uncertain. To manage without annual budgets, organizations should adhere to the following six principles:Proctor, Ray; Managerial accounting for business decisions; Essex: Pearson Education, 2006; p. 420 * Base goals on external benchmarks rather than on internally negotiated targets. * Base evaluation on rewards on relative improvement contracts rather than on fixed performance contracts agreed upon in advance. * Make action planning a continuous and inclusive process rather than an annual and restrictive exercise. * Make resources available as required under KPI accountability rather than allocated in advance on the basis of annual budgets. * Coordinate cross-company actions dynamically according to prevailing customer demand rather than a predetermined annual master budget. * Base controls on effective governance and on a range of relative performance indicators rather than on fixed reviews against annual plans and budgets. Better Budgeting: Better Budgeting, also known as advanced budgeting, intends to increase the efficiency of the traditional budgeting approach, mainly by streamlining budgetary processes through market orientation and optimization. Therewith better budgeting aims for a more flexible and less resource consuming design of budgeting. The designing elements of a better budgeting approach are:Slebioda; Damian Markus; Better und Beyond Budgeting: Kritische Diskussion der Weiterentwicklung der Weiterentwicklung der klassischen Budgetierungsformen; Norderstedt: GRIN, 2008, pp. 5f * coordination through budgets: adapt the coordination of traditional budgeting for increasing complexity and dynamics * decentralization: increase flexibility of budgetary process by decentralized authority * focus and criticality: reduce the level of detailed budgets and thereby increase speed of forecasting * analytical planning from baseline: no longer based on previous year's effective figures * strategy orientation: establish strong link to strategic planning * rolling forecasts: follow the changing market conditions by not restricting the planning to the financial reporting requirements * self-control: foster focus on materiality through self-control of the respective budget responsible * reduction of dysfunctional effects: avoid dysfunctional effects, such as budget buffers, by not leading people based on budgets * stronger support of planning process with adequate tools: achieve cost effectiveness by using planning applications. Besides tailored approaches, Damian Markus Slebioda names zero-based budgeting and activity-based budgeting to be two examples of better budgeting approaches.Slebioda; Damian Markus; Better und Beyond Budgeting: Kritische Diskussion der Weiterentwicklung der Weiterentwicklung der klassischen Budgetierungsformen; Norderstedt: GRIN, 2008, p. 6 Kaizen Budgeting: Budgeting approach that explicitly incorporates continuous improvements during the budget period into the resultant budget numbers.Bhimani, Alnoor; Horngren, Charles; Datar, Srikant; Foster, George; Management and Cost Accounting; Essex: Prentice Hall, 2008; p. 484  Methodology  Conditional budgeting derives many ideas from multiple budgeting approaches, however, it is unique in the way how it combines budgeting and analysis of current status, and then releases expenses (while other budgeting approaches compare variances between actual and budget). The budget becomes a process for everyone to agree on income probability and expense priority. It no longer defines a certain level of expenses; rather, it is a process for an organization to agree at what income and earning level to release what amount of expenses and resources. The budgeting approaches that served as the foundation for conditional budgeting include traditional budgeting, zero-based budgeting, better budgeting and beyond budgeting. While building on the strengths of these approaches, conditional budgeting avoids the disadvantages of these approaches for organizations or in times of unstable income streams. The two main benefits are: # Expenses are budgeted according to priority level and in correlation with income and cash flow. In the effective year, expenses are only released based on the corresponding positive income and cash situation. # During the effective year, the ongoing analysis does not explain deviations, the analysis rather focuses on defining the appropriate point in time when to release the conditionally pre-agreed expenses.  Planning objective  While any budget approach aims to think through different future scenarios and the respective reactions of the company regarding capacity and resources, different approaches set different priorities regarding other aspects, e.g. how flexibly resources shall be adapted to changing market conditions or who shall be entitled to define targets. One of the strengths of traditional budgeting is the integration with financial reporting. While this close relationship is also mentioned as disadvantage above, all organizations remain to be confronted with financial reporting (see also Financial statement).As all organizations are somehow bond to some form of taxation (even it results into being tax exempted), and taxation builds on some form of annual financial reporting, fueled by accounting and local GAAPs (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) One advantage arising from this close relationship is that financial reporting as well as traditional budgeting have established procedures how operational figures regarding sales and costs (at all levels, departmental up to group- wide) are reflected in the Income Statement, and then combined with capital expenditure and financing roll into the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement. Given the growing importance of the Statement of Financial Positions (the financial situation of companies is no longer dependent on the Income Statement only, Financing and the Statement of Financial Positions enjoys an increasing importance), allowing the budget to use existing and established mechanisms to roll into a full set of financial reports can clearly be used as an advantage. And so it the reuse of existing knowledge regarding interpretation and taking decisions based on financial reporting and Financial ratio (this aspect relates to the above-mentioned advantage of communication). A third objective besides reusing the existing advantage of integrated financial analysis and building on existing financial reporting knowledge is the ongoing review of actual versus budget and taking corrective actions if necessary. While other budgeting approaches allow analyzing such variations after they did occur, conditional budgeting strives to take a more proactive approach. It only releases costs only after a pre-defined level of income, which has jointly been agreed upon to be necessary in order to release the costs, has been achieved.  Planning income  As suggested by Peter Drucker, income is key for any business: there are only cost centers within a business, and the only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced.Drucker, Peter; Managing in the Next Society. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2002; p. 84 However, estimating income is not an easy task, and it might be harder for certain organizations such as NPOs (Non-profit organization) being dependent on number of visitors or NGOs (Non-governmental organization) being dependent on donations), or at certain times such as during changes in consumer habits (e.g. consumers avoiding department stores and turning to fast fashion retailers), society values (a company being perceived to be involved in a scandal, e.g. Shell's income in Germany fell by 50% during the Brent Spar crisisThe Brent Spar), or during economic crises. Based on this understanding of fluctuating income, conditional budgeting requires executives to plan income at the following four stages: * secured income: income that is very likely to be achieved, even under pessimistic scenarios. This income results from normal ongoing operations and includes a certain amount of fixed cost and/or sunk costs, i.e. expenses that apply regardless of the level of income resulting from the activities. Information for this stage may be drawn form existing orders (but only non-changeable, fixed orders) or from previous years coupled with market analysis for the budgeting year. * additional income: this stage holds any additional income that is planned to be achieved through additional income generating activities. Such activities might include special advertising campaigns, opening of new locations, entering new markets, or running a new fund raising activity for NPOs. It is important to distinguish which of these activities are necessary to stay in business (i.e. to achieve the secured income in the long run) and which really lead to additional income for the budget period. Several similar activities may be bundled into one single activity for simplicity reasons. Besides planning income, the additional expenses for such activities including direct variable cost (see also indirect costs) must be budgeted as income deduction. * optimistic secured income: while secured income is planned pessimistically, this stage describes what income may realistically be expected from the ongoing activities (assuming that the results are realistic to somewhat optimistic). Any additional direct variable costs for this higher level of income must be deducted from the optimistic secured income. As all fixed and/or sunk costs are already accounted for at stage one, and therefore this higher level optimistic secured income contributes directly to the gross margin. * optimistic additional income: while additional income is planned pessimistically, this stage describes what additional income may realistically be expected from additional income generating activities (assuming that the results are realistic to somewhat optimistic). Any additional direct variable costs for this higher level of income must be deducted from the optimistic additional income. As all fixed and/or sunk costs are already accounted for at stage two, and therefore this higher-level optimistic additional income contributes directly to the gross margin. These four stages result in a minimum income, consisting of stage one and stage two, and a maximum income, consisting of all four stages. These two income levels, minimum and maximum, will then be compared to planned expenses.  Planning expenses  For planning expenses, the organization shall take a strict analysis regarding the necessity of expenses. Expenses then are grouped according to how important the payment of the respective expenses is regarding to the success and survival of the organization. While in most cases the costs may be assess regarding their importance to the success of the companies, in times of crisis an organization may be forces to rate the importance of their expenses according to the survival or the organization. The four groups of expenses are: * fixed expenses: these expenses are absolutely necessary and may not be avoided by any means, unless drastic consequences for the organization are acceptable. Which expenses an organization may recognize as fixed is largely dependent on its current situations and might be determined by contracts and law, especially labor law. These costs include the direct variable costs associated with the secured income. * Priority 1 expenses: such expenses are of high priority, they may be even be vital for the long-term survival of the organization, but not for the short-term survival. Priority 1 means that as income and cash gets available during the budget period, these expenses are the first ones to spend the income and cash on. A later discussion has to define if these expenses shall be released all at once only or partial release may apply. Examples of these costs may include education and knowledge building for a services firm, product development or machinery optimization for a manufacturing firm, or additional projects to be financed for an NPO. * Priority 2 expenses: such expenses are of lower priority, but still important for the organization. Examples may include research & development, acquisitions, or market expansion. * Priority 3 expenses: this group holds all remaining expenses. These may be things like donations to charities, employee fringe benefits, bonuses, rebuilding, cafeteria discounts or sponsoring (these examples may not apply to a specific organization where the respective activities are key for short-term survival or short-term success). These four groups result in minimum expenses, consisting of fixed expenses, and maximum expenses, consisting of all four groups of expenses.  Planning cash  Based on the cash flow calculation according to the cash flow statement, changes in cash result mainly from: * operating activities: net income before depreciation, changes in working capital, and changes in provisions * investing activities: investments and disinvestments * financing activities: transactions with owners as well as borrowing and repayment of loans or other forms of financing Planning of cash focuses on investment and disinvestments as all other figures are derived from other planning sections (income, expenses and financing). For simplicity reasons and as for a majority of companies disinvestment many enjoy minor significance only (exceptions apply), disinvestments shall be planned at one stage only. For the investments, the same stages apply as for planning of expenses. In total, planning of cash consists of the following five stages: * disinvestments: planning of cash and profit on disinvestment (sales price compared to book value) * fixed investment: investments being absolutely critical for success and survival of the organization. * Priority 1 investments: investments that shall be released immediately after respective cash (and income to cover additional depreciation expenses) is available. Similar to the expenses, a decision has to be taken if priority 1 investments have to be released all at once or if they may re partly released as the cash and income situation allows to do so partly. If partial release applies, further decisions have to be taken on the sequence (having 120 cash available, shall the one big investment for 100 or the 2 small for 50 each be release?). * Priority 2 investments: investments being less critically, but still important. * Priority 3 investments: all remaining investments. These five stages result in minimum cash, consisting of disinvestments and fixed investments, and maximum cash, consisting of all five stages.  Planning financing  Planning of financing requires to plan all financial positions that influence the required level of financing, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, loan, provision (accounting), and equity (finance). As these positions influence one another (e.g. additional investments may be finance by different ratios of loans and equity), they must be planned dynamically. All these figures must be planned at two stages: * minimum: amount / value of each figure in case of minimum income, expenses and cash. * maximum: amount / value of each figure in case of maximum income, expenses and cash. Providing additional ratios, e.g. inventory turnover, may help to define the right value for each figure. The planning of financing at minimum and maximum level provides the remaining figures to integrate the different planning and take the necessary budget decisions.  Tying the planning to a budget  After all necessary details have been provided to result in minimum and maximum income, expenses, cash, and financing, the plans can be tied together into an integrated budget. However, this first requires to: * provide Latest Estimates and therewith an actual forecast for the current year: as budgeting normally takes place in autumn (in case the financial year matches the fiscal year), figures that indicate the situation at the end of the current year must first be provided to then provide the correct calculation, especially for the Statement of Financial Positions. These Latest Estimates are critically important, for if they are wrong, the budget may not be suitable as a decision basis (e.g. if the amount of cash available turns out to be significantly below the forecast amount, Priority 1 investments may realistically never be likely to be released during the budget period). * provide some additional ratios, including depreciation rates, interest rates, and tax rates. These ratios will be used to provide the respective automated calculations, e.g. to automatically calculate the depreciation expenses for the capital expenditures. These calculations are especially helpful to later suggest releasing priority 1, 2 or 3 expenses and capital expenditures, as they allow to automatically calculating all consequences of any such decision. The resulting budget shows the integrated minimum and maximum figures. At least, the minimum budget should be positive (i.e. the minimum income and cash covers the fixed expenses and capital expenditures). Ideally, the maximum budget is also positive, i.e. under realistic-optimistic assumptions the income pays all expenses and capital expenses. If the maximum budget it seems adequate to inform the respective people that priority 3 resources may never be released through the budgeting period and therefore they may be taken off the plan. Alternatively, additional income generating measures or fund-raising may be planned in order to ensure a positive enough income and cash situation to possibly also accommodate for Priority 3 expenses and capital expenditures. And these are the discussions on resource priority that a budget intends to foster to then agree for the focus of the respective period, and therewith having the possibility to set different focus for the next period (e.g. invest in people the first year, and the following year invest in machinery). Such iterations bear the risk that one additional income generating measure is added after the other, which may reduce the overall effectiveness of each measure. Other potential violations of the budget structure include increasing the level of optimistic income. While such violations are real risks, it is a question of leadership to gear the discussions into the right direction. The conditional budgeting approach may provide supporting ratios for cross-checking and comparison (e.g. revenue by sales person, if increasing too much optimistic income levels may be estimated too high).  Budget review: analyzing conditions  The first step of analyzing actual results with the budget is to enter effective figures for the previous year (the forecast at the time the budget was established). If the effective figures divide too far away from the forecast figure, the budget may be not achievable (e.g. the available cash is too low for fixed investments even). Then the current year figures are added, following the same structure as budget (four stages for income, four stages for expenses, and five stages for cash). Base on the actual situation of income and cash, assessment of releasing priority 1, 2 or 3 expenses and investments may be discusses. Therefore the organization does not have to stick to one of the scenarios or alternatives that it has decided upon some month ago, rather the organization understands what the current income and cash situation is, how much additional income may be expected, and what the impact of releasing the next bundle of expenses and investments is. Therewith, the discussion turns from analyzing variances and possibly explaining why the actual did not turn out to be what the budget was, the discussion is more forward-looking focusing on how much the income and cash has to increase before additional expenses are release, and how such an increase may be achieved. While conditional budgeting may support an organization regarding if the income and cash conditions are meat so that releasing the next bundle of expenses and investments is save, the organizations still has to decide on the details of such a release: * shall all expenses of one bundle be released at once (all expenses and all investments)? If so, what happens to 'remaining' income and cash at the end of the period, is it brought forward to the next period (so in the next period it is already available to release priority 1 expenses and investments)? * may allow certain expenses and investments to be released independently (i.e. do different items in the priority 1 group have different priorities?) * if certain expenses and investments are released independently, how to be decided upon which are to be released (if 120 income is available, should one big expense at 100 be released or two small ones at 50 each)? May such decisions be different at the beginning of the period than at the end? While traditional budgets answer such questions upfront, organizations using conditional budgeting may be confronted with such questions several times during the budget period. Answering these questions may be difficult as the expenses in one bundle may be of very different character, e.g. Priority 2 expenses may include individual education for staff as well as upgrading the office software package to the current release. While upgrading the software requires all installations to be upgraded at once (otherwise the heterogeneous environment may cause even higher costs), selecting what employees to allow attending an education needs to be aligned with leadership, motivation and compensation approaches.  Examples  Conditional budgeting has been used successfully at Foundation Green Ethiopia, an NGO supporting agriculture and afforestation projects in rural Ethiopia. Any project expenses are clearly tied to respective income. Conditional budgeting has allowed the organization to successfully implement projects to benefit rural farmers in Ethiopia, and it has allowed the organization to smoothly grow 5-fold within 10 years without adding more complexity to the budgeting and financial performance measurement. Instead, the resources have been used for conducting projects, manage operational performance, and therewith focus on income and growth instead of managing costs and expenses.

Reaction Motors, Inc. (RMI) was an early American maker of liquid-fueled rocket engines, located in New Jersey. RMI engines with thrust powered the Bell X-1 rocket aircraft that first broke the sound barrier in 1947, and later successors including the X-1A, X1E, and the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. A thrust RMI engine also powered the Viking research rocket, the first large liquid-fueled US high-altitude rocket. RMI was merged with Thiokol in 1958, where it produced the XLR-99 engine that powered the X-15 rocket aircraft. History  Formation and the sound barrier  Reaction Motors, Inc. began operation as early as 1930 through the work of then American Interplanetary Society members Lovell Lawrence, George Edward Pendray, Hugh Pierce, and engineer John Shesta. This group quickly moved from science fiction discussions to practical rocketry. Pendray contributed heavily to their early designs using knowledge acquired from a trip to Berlin in 1931. In 1938, Princeton University student James Hart Wyld tested a two-pound rocket engine which provided 90 pounds of thrust; this would become the basis for the group's work over the next two decades. Though test flights are recorded from 1933 forward, the group would rename themselves the American Rocket Society and continue experimentation in the relatively populous area of Staten Island until incorporating Reaction Motors, Inc. under Lovell Lawrence in 1938 in pursuit of a war-time contract from the United States Navy. In 1938 and prior to incorporation, the group successfully designed and perfected the world's first workable regenerative cooling rocket engine, technology which would for the first time make liquid-fueled rocket engines capable of burning for long enough periods to be practical. All future liquid-fueled rockets would build off this technology. They tested this rocket engine in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, not far from the laboratory they built it in. With Lawrence as president and Wyld, Pierce, and Shesta as company officers, Reaction Motors, Inc. received its first naval contract in 1942. Operating on a start-up budget of $5,000, the company first used a bicycle shop in Oakland, NJ belonging to Shesta's brother in-law as mailing address and laboratory but soon moved to a previous night club in Pompton Plains, NJ to provide space for rocket engine testing and machine work. In 1945, Reaction Motors, Inc. was granted a contract from the United States Army to develop a rocket engine for the first of the \\"X\\" series of experimental airplanes, designed to break the sound barrier. Undaunted by the 1946 death of British test pilot Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., the company eventually furnished the X-1 project with a design based upon four of Wyld's engines which would provide 1,500 pounds of thrust each. On October 14, 1947, American test pilot Chuck Yeager was the first in the world to break the sound barrier, piloting the X-1 with the four Reaction Motors, Inc. engines. Yeager was able to complete his flight safely due to the remarkably smooth flight provided by Wyld's system and despite the fact that he had broken several ribs while horse-riding the previous day. Merger with Thiokol and the Space Race In early 1956, following an extensive bidding war, Reaction Motors, Inc. was awarded a contract from the United States Navy for the development of the proposed XLR30 engine to be used to pilot the experimental aircraft known as X-15 and eventually pursue manned spaceflight. After much misadventure, a massive increase in budgetary requirements, and engineering problems related to fuel injectors and the thrust chamber which resulted in the Navy enlisting the assistance of the Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation, the XLR30 engine project was moved back on track with a new designation of TR-139 to convey the striking changes in design which were required. On April 17, 1958, Reaction Motors, Inc.'s acquisition by Thiokol Chemical Corporation was finalized by the approval of the stockholders and RMI was henceforth referred to as Reaction Motors Division (RMD). RMD's engine for the X-15 was completed and 199 flights were made before the X-15 project was discontinued in 1969, years past its due date and having cost more than five times its original budget. The X-15 is credited as having reached a record mach 6.72 at 67 miles above the Earth, being solely responsible for providing the data necessary to insulate and maintain the structural integrity of the Mercury spacecraft, and a host of additional technical achievements and aviation milestones.

She committed suicide in July 1992, a week after the Mafia killed the prosecutor Paolo Borsellino, with whom she had been working. Family background Rita was born into a Mafia family in Partanna, Sicily. In 1985, at the age of 11, she lost her father, Vito, a shepherd, who was shot dead by a hit man from a rival Mafia family. Atria‚Äôs brother, Nicola, vowed to avenge his father and probably knew who the murderer was.Longrigg, Clare. \\"Where talking is met with deadly silence\\", The Independent, September 21, 1992.

Since her brother was also a Mafioso, Rita was privy to detailed information on the doings of the Mafia in Partanna. She also dated a boy who moved in the criminal underworld.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, pp. 325-26 In June 1991, the Mafia killed Nicola Atria. A month later her brother‚Äôs widow, Piera Aiello, went to the police and talked ‚Äì deciding to collaborate with the judicial authorities. Rita Atria ‚Äì la sua storia in breve, Associazione antimafia Rita Atria Anti-mafia testimony At 17 years of age, Rita decided in November 1991 to follow in her sister-in-law's footsteps, hoping to obtain justice for these murders from the legal system. The first person to receive her testimony was the magistrate Paolo Borsellino, to whom she bonded as a father. She named the heads of the most powerful families and told Borsellino about the war between the Mafia families of Partanna, in which 30 people died. She also named the men who had killed her father and her brother. Her mother threw Rita out of the house when she found out that her daughter was collaborating with the police. She did not care that her own son's killer was to be brought to justice; in her opinion ‚Äì and the deep-rooted Mafia culture she belonged to ‚Äì the police were on the wrong side of the law. Rita was relocated to a safe house in a seventh-floor flat on the outskirts of Rome, where the only people she knew were her police guards. Borsellino became her lifeline. The evidence given by Rita and Piera, together with other testimony, led to the arrest of various Mafiosi and to the launch of an enquiry into the politician Vincenzo Culicchia, who had been mayor of Partanna for thirty years.Pickering-Iazzi, Mafia and Outlaw Stories from Italian Life and Literature, p. 166 Evidence from another woman, Rosalba Triolo, from the rival Mafia factions in Partanna, independently confirmed the testimonies of Rita and Piera. Suicide Abandoned by friends and family, both Rita and Piera Aiello had turned to Borsellino for emotional support. They referred to him as \\"Uncle Paolo\\" and phoned him whenever they needed him. He visited them whenever he was in Rome, even after they had finished their depositions. Borsellino used to pinch Rita on the cheek and poked fun at her tough, streetwise behaviour, calling her a \\"mafiosa with a skirt.\\" On 19 July 1992, a Mafia bomb killed Borsellino, less than two months after his colleague Giovanni Falcone had been killed. Rita wrote in her diary: \\"You have died for what you believed in, but without you, I too am dead.\\"Apperly, Eliza. \\"Italy anti-mafia film sparks anger with relatives\\", Reuters, March 26, 2009. Accessed July 19, 2014. A week later, on 26 July, Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: \\"I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino. Now there's no one to protect me, I'm scared and I can't take it any more.\\" Then she threw herself out of the window. Legacy Many people regard Rita as a heroine because of her willingness to sacrifice everything, including the affection of her mother (who after her daughter's death destroyed her tombstone with a hammer) in order to pursue justice. She grew from a desire for revenge for her losses to one for justice. Like Piera, Rita was not a Mafia penitent (pentito), as she had not committed any crimes to repent. Because of this, she is referred to as a \\"witness of justice\\", a title that has been legally recognised in Italy by the law of 13/2/2001 n. 45.https://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/01045l.htm Rita wrote in her diary: \\"Before fighting the Mafia you must first examine your own conscience, and then, after you have defeated the Mafia inside yourself, you can fight the Mafia that's in your circle of friends.

The field originally known as Smith Lake Airfield. In June 1952 the 6th Transportation Company (Helicopter) arrived with 21 Sikorsky H-19C Chickasaw and two Bell H-13 Sioux helicopters; it deployed to Korea in December 1952 as the first combat helicopter company. On May 1953 Fort Bragg engineers completed final plans for an expanded field and started construction the next summer. In August 1954, the runway was repaved, aprons improved and the floor was laid for field's first hangar. On June 21, 1955, the airfield was renamed in honor of Warrant Officer Herbert W. Simmons, Jr., a pilot killed on November 3, 1953, when two H-29B helicopters collided near the field. During the mid-1950s, the Helio U-10 Courier aircraft was tested at Simmons. Most of the Army's U-10s were stationed at Fort Bragg and in the Panama Canal Zone. The first U-10 from Fort Bragg is now in the Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker in Alabama. Construction in 1956-1957 converted the field to a permanent army airfield, allowing transfer of air activities from overcrowded Pope Air Force Base to Simmons AAF. In 1957 the 82nd Aviation Company was formed at Simmons. In the early 1960s Fort Bragg and Simmons played an important role in emerging air mobility. In December 1961 the 8th Transportation Company (Light Helicopter), departed Simmons AAF with their Piasecki H-21 helicopters for duty in Vietnam. The 8th and another unit, the 57th Transportation Company, were the first helicopter units to serve in Southeast Asia. By 1965 Simmons comprised 23 permanent buildings, which remain in use. Fixed wing aircraft based at Simmons included the XVIII Airborne Corps and 82nd Airborne Division liaison planes, Grumman OV-1 Mohawk observation aircraft and the 4th ASTA (Aerial Surveillance Target Acquisition) attached to the 82nd Aviation Battalion. During July 1965 the 116th Assault Helicopter Company formed at Simmons and trained for duty in Vietnam. The company departed for Vietnam in October 1965 and joined the 11th Combat Aviation Battalion there. The 18th Aviation Brigade activated at Fort Bragg on July 1, 1966, formed from the 269th Aviation Battalion. Following seven months of training, the 269th departed for Vietnam in January 1967 where it served in the 12th Aviation Group. By 1976 Simmons had 176 aircraft assigned and 375 flights operations a day. In 1983 the number grew to 298 aircraft. The 82nd Combat Aviation Battalion expanded in July 1979, acquiring the 119th and 129th Assault Helicopter Companies of the 269th Aviation Battalion. These two companies became A and B companies of the newly designated 82nd Combat Aviation Battalion. The Battalion deployed to Grenada for Operation Urgent Fury in October 1983 and remained into 1984. In the early 1980s there were 22 operating activities with total personnel strength of 2,134 and 298 assigned aircraft. On August 17, 1987 the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 269th Aviation Battalion, reorganized and was redesignated as the 18th Aviation Brigade. The brigade served in the Persian Gulf, Panama, first Gulf War, and provided storm relief following Florida's Hurricane Andrew. On the first day of the Gulf War, February 24, 1991, the 18th Aviation Brigade airlifted troops and equipment into Iraq. By 2002 Simmons AAF had more than 180 aircraft, along with Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache flight simulators.  Facilities  Simmons AAF has one runway designated 9/27 with an asphalt surface measuring 4,650 by 110 feet (1,417 x 34 m).

The legislature is a bicameral body composed of the upper house Arkansas Senate with 35 members, and the lower Arkansas House of Representatives with 100 members. All 135 representatives and state senators represent an equal number of constituent districts. The General Assembly convenes on the second Monday of every other year. A session lasts for 60 days unless the legislature votes to extend it. The Governor of Arkansas can issue a \\"call\\" for a special session during the interims between regular sessions. The General Assembly meets at the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock. History The Arkansas General Assembly is authorized by the Arkansas Constitution, which is the state's fifth constitution. The first was constitution was ratified on January 30, 1836, and the current constitution was adopted in 1874.Arkansas General Assembly, Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture (accessed April 28, 2013) The constitution has also been amended throughout the state's history since 1874. Originally, legislators met biennially, but today meet annually.Arkansas Legislative Council, Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture (accessed April 28, 2013) In 1922, Frances Hunt became the first woman elected to a seat in the Arkansas General Assembly when she was elected to a seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives. Powers and process The Arkansas General Assembly is responsible for making and amending the laws of Arkansas. The legislative process is similar to that of other state legislatures in the United States. Bills undergo committee review and three readings on the floor of each house of the legislature. The governor has veto power, but a simple majority of both houses of the legislature can override that veto.http://www.nga.org/files/live/sites/NGA/files/pdf/BOSTable3.16.pdf Legislators also select 20 state representatives and 16 state senators to serve on the Arkansas Legislative Council, which oversees the Bureau of Legislative Research and acts as an organizing committee for the legislature. Terms and term limits Amendment 73 of the Arkansas Constitution, approved by voters in the 1992 state general elections, set term limits for Representatives and Senators. Representatives were limited to three two-year terms (six years); Senators were limited to two four-year terms (eight years). (Amendment 73 also set term limits for U.S. Senators and Representatives. That part of the Amendment was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton. Section 4 of the Amendment included a severability clause so the remainder of the amendment remained in force.) This was largely obviated by Amendment 94 of 2014, which extended the total years that could be served to 16, in any combination of House and Senate seats.

Knox, PhD in Theology & Religion (2009), University of Birmingham, UK. As theological thought evolved, specifically after the advent of liberalism in the nineteenth century, a change began to take place in the religious world. Religious attitudes and prioritization seem to begin shifting from Sacro-Clericalism, where authority is given to the church and its representatives, to Sacro- Egoism, where the individual assumes greatest authority. The role of the individual, the self, was elevated more than ever before and self-reliance was glamorized, epitomized, and utilized in society‚Äîeven until the present. Liberal theologians like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Tillich \\". . . sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview.\\"Alister McGrath, Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 1998), 233. Schleiermacher, known as the father of modern liberal theology, considered religion and Christianity to be \\". . . the distinctly human awareness of something infinite beyond the self on whom the self is dependent for everything.\\"Roger Olson, The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition & Reform (Illinois, IN: InterVarsity Press, 1999), 544. Though first a subtle and infrequent occurrence, more and more the authority and centrality of the Church began to lose ground to the prominence of the individual. Culturally, the expression of religion and Christianity encountered \\". . . a turn towards life lived by reference to one's own subjective experiences (relational as much as individualistic).\\"Paul Heelas and Linda Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion is Giving Way to Spirituality (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2005), 2. Leaning on one's own understanding became an asset, not a detriment, to religious life and approval. According to Heelas and Woodhead, \\"The subjectivities of each individual become a, if not the, unique source of significance, meaning and authority.\\"Heelas and Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution, 3-4. Grasso continues this understanding stating, \\"Liberalism's movement toward an ever deeper individualism receives signal expression in the ascendancy of the type of liberalism that dominates our intellectual scene, in the ascendancy . . . termed the liberalism of the unencumbered self.\\"Kenneth L. Grasso, ‚ÄòChristianity, Enlightenment Liberalism, and the Quest for Freedom,‚Äô Modern Age (Fall 2006): 304. Starks and Robinson comment that modernists \\". . . see individuals and not a deity as the ultimate arbiters of moral authority and hold to a largely individually directed universe.\\"Brian Starks and Robert Robinson, ‚ÄòMoral Cosmology, Religion, and Adult Values for Children,‚Äô Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 46, no. 1 (March 2007): 32. Religious focus has moved from the institution to the individual. Currently, this shift can be observed in a variety of ways as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered membership and attendance numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion. Christian society has never operated from a vacuum. Furseth and Repstad state, \\"It is simply not true that individuals invent their own world-view in a void.\\"Inger Furseth and P√•l Repstad, An Introduction to the Sociology of Religion (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), 124. From its earliest beginnings, this religious movement has interacted closely with culture, as did its founder. Thus, this interaction \\". . . is two-way: Christianity both influences and is influenced by culture.\\"McGrath, Historical Theology, 9. Furthermore, the expression of Christian faith has never been static. Sociological studies of Religion such as the Kendal Projecthttp://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/projects/ieppp/kendal/methods.htm and the McMinnville ProjectJohn S. Knox PhD Dissertation Research Project (2006-7). aptly demonstrate a religious transformation from older traditional patterns. Sacro-Egoism suggests that at the heart and in the origins of Christianity and modern religion is a personalized, dynamic, individualistic faith. This is Sacro-Egoism.

Formally, this is plural (\\"my Lords\\"), but the plural is usually construed as a respectful, and not a syntactic plural. (The singular form is Adoni, \\"my lord\\". This was used by the Phoenicians for the god Tammuz and is the origin of the Greek name Adonis. Jews only use the singular to refer to a distinguished person: in the plural, \\"rabotai\\", literally, \\"my masters\\", is used in both Mishnaic and modern Hebrew.) Since pronouncing YHWH is avoided out of reverence for the holiness of the name, Jews use Adonai instead in prayers, and colloquially would use Hashem (\\"the Name\\"). When the Masoretes added vowel pointings to the text of the Hebrew Bible around the eighth century CE, they gave the word YHWH the vowels of Adonai, to remind the reader to say Adonai instead. It is thought by some that later Biblical scholars mistook this vowel substitution for the actual spelling of YHWH and interpreted the name of God as \\"Jehovah\\". The Sephardi translators of the Ferrara Bible go further and substitute Adonai with A.

Like in almost all Asteraceae, the individual flowers are 5-merous, small and clustered in typical heads, and are surrounded by an involucre, consisting of in this case several whorls of bracts, which are merged at their base. In Gorteria, the centre of the head is taken by relatively few bisexual and sometimes also male, yellow to orange disc florets, and is surrounded by one complete whorl of 5‚Äì14 infertile cream to dark orange ray florets, sometimes with a few ray florets nearer to the centre. None, some or all of them may have darker spots at their base. The fruits remain attached to their common base when ripe, and it is the entire head that breaks free from the plant. One or few seeds germinate inside the flower head which can be found at the foot of plants during their first year. The species flower between August and October, except for G. warmbadica that blooms mostly in May and June. The species of the genus Gorteria can be found in Namibia and South Africa.  Description  Gorteria personataFive of the species assigned to Gorteria are always annuals, two always shrublets (G. alienata and G. integrifolia), and one species (G. diffusa) is mostly annual, but populations near the coast in Namaqualand tend to survive and become woody in their second year. The stems are cylindrical (or terete) with long, stiff white hairs, rarely reddish or blackish at their foot, striped along their lengths, and sometimes with short soft hair as well. The alternately set leaves lack a stalk, have margins rolled downward and inward. The upper surface is sparsely to densely set with ¬Ω‚Äì2 mm (0.02-0.08 in) long stiff white hairs, while the lower surface is whitish felty hairy except on the midvein. The flower heads can be found on their own at the end of the branches, and are enveloped in an involucre, whose bracts are merged at their base only, with short, soft, silky white hairs and long, stiff white hairs with striping along their lengths. These involucres become woody with age, and the entire flower heads detach from the mother plant with the fruits (or cypselas) inside them. Later one new plant emerges (or sometimes up to five) from it. The common base of the florets (called the receptacle) does not have receptacular bracts (or paleas) at the foot of each floret. There are between five and fourteen infertile ray florets that have a base color that ranges between cream and dark orange. At the base there may be darker spots, sometimes jointly creating a ring, but sometimes only present on two or three of the ray florets. The underside has mostly a darker, less clear color and there are some short, striped hairs. The fertile yellow to orange disc florets are somewhat bilateral symmetrical (or zygomorph), deeply incised to form five lobes and have some hairs and glandular hairs. Some set seed, but most of them are functionally male. The anthers do not have tail extensions.  Differences with related genera  A very particular character for Gorteria is that plants in their first year have an old flower head at their foot, because the cypselas do not part from the flower head when ripe, but germinate remaining in the flower head. Furthermore, the species of Gorteria share spine-like hairs on the corollas of both ray- and disc florets, the bracts of the involucre merged only at their foot, and crystals below the skin of the outer seed coat. All these characters are absent in its near relatives.  Taxonomy  Carl Linnaeus, famous for his introduction of the binominal nomenclature, erected the genus Gorteria, in part II of the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1759, with the description of the type species Gorteria personata. Linnaeus' circumscription of the genus was much wider than today, since he included species that now are in several other genera of the Gorteriinae, such as G. squarrosa (= Cullumia squarrosa) in 1760, Gorteria rigens (= Gazania rigens) and G. fruticosa (= Berkheya barbata), both in 1763. Carl Peter Thunberg in 1798 reviewed Gorteria and considered the interlocked margins (or connation) of the involucral bracts diagnostic for the genus, but this is in fact common to the entire subtribe Gorteriinae. He distinguished ten herbaceous species and two woody, seven including G. diffusa and G. integrifolia new to science. In 1818, French botanist Henri Cassini described the new genus Ictinus with type species piloselloides, but in 1824 reassigned it to Gorteria, making the new combination G. piloselloides. In 1820, Cassini erected the genus Hirpicium with type species H. echinulatum. This however is an illegitimate name, since the type specimen is identical to that used by Thunberg to base Oedera alienata on in 1792, and the correct name would be Hirpicium alienatum (= G. alienata). In 1797, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck erected the genus Personaria, and in 1816, Jean Louis Marie Poiret reassigned Personaria personata to Gorteria. In 1832, German botanist Christian Friedrich Lessing restricted Gorteria. In 1838, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described three further species: G. affinis, G. calendulacea and G. corymbosa. In 1959 and 1973, Helmuth Roessler distinguished two subspecies in G. personata, subsp. personata and subsp. gracilis, and three subspecies in G. diffusa, subsp. diffusa, subsp. calendulacea and subsp. parviligulosa. Only in 2014, Frida St√•ngberg and Arne Anderberg reassigned Hirpicium alienatum and H. integrifolium to Gorteria, and clarified the relationship between the taxa within Gorteria. The genus was named in honour of the Dutch physicians and botanists Johannes de Gorter and his son David de Gorter.  Phylogeny  The tribe Arctotideae consists of the subtribes Arctotidinae and Gorteriinae. The Gorteriinae contain two groups, one comprising Berkheya, Cullumia, Cuspidia, Didelta and Heterorhachis, the other one Gorteria and its close relatives of the genera Gazania and Hirpicium. Recent comparison of homologous genes has seriously upset the delineation of the species within Gorteria and prompted the reassignment of Hirpicium alienatum and H. integrifolium to Gorteria. According to this study, the species and their relationships are as expressed in the following tree.  Reassigned species  The species that were originally described as, or moved to Gorteria, which since have been reassigned include the following: * G. acaulis = Haplocarpha leichtinii * G. arachnoidea = ? * G. araneosa = Cuspidia cernua * G. asteroides = Berkheya fruticosa * G. barbata = Berkheya barbata * G. cathamoides = Berkheya barbata * G. cernua = Cuspidia cernua * G. ciliaris = Cullumia ciliaris * G. ciliata = Cullumia patula * G. cruciata = Berkheya cruciata * G. echinata = Cuspidia cernua * G. fruticosa = Berkheya fruticosa * G. herbacea = Berkheya herbacea * G. heterophylla = Gazania sp. * G. hispica = Cullumia aculeata * G. ilicifolia = Berkheya fruticosa * G. incisa = Gazania sp. * G. linearis = Gazania linearis * G. loureiroana = ? * G. lyratopinnnatifida = Gazania pinnata * G. mitis = Heterolepis mitis * G. oppositifolia = Berkheya angustifolia * G. othonnites = Gazania othonnites * G. ovata = Relhania rotundifolia * G. pavonia = Gazania pavonia * G. pectinata = Gazania pectinata * G. pinnata Lam. = Gazania pinnata? * G. pinnata Thunb. = Gazania pinnata * G. rigens = Gazania rigens * G. rigida = Stobaea gaertneri * G. setosa = Cullumia setosa * G. speciosa = Gazania pectinata * G. spectabilis = Gazania rigens * G. spinosa L.f. = Berkheya spinosa * G. spinosa auct non L.f.(Jacq.) = Cullumia bisulca * G. squarrosa = Cullumia squarrosa * G. uniflora = Gazania rigens var. uniflora  Distribution  Representatives of the genus Gorteria can be found in the !Karas Region of Namibia, the Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces, and a few observations in the west of the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

It is native to North Africa and the Middle East, as far east as Balochistan. Together with the very different Cavea tanguensis it constitutes the tribe Gymnarrheneae, and in the subfamily Gymnarrhenoideae. Gymnarrhena is a small, flowering, winter annual with a rosette of simple, narrow leaves and flower heads cropped at its hart. It does not contain latex and does not carry spines. Gymnarrhena flowers in March and April. One of the common names in Arabic is ŸÉŸéŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸéŸÑŸíÿ® meaning \\"dog's footprint\\", while in Hebrew it is called ◊û◊ï◊¶◊†◊ô◊™ ◊ß◊ò◊†◊™-◊§◊®◊ó◊ô◊ù meaning \\"small chaff flower\\".  Description  Gymnarrhena micrantha is a dwarf annual herb of ¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm high, with all its leaves in rosette of up to 10 cm in diameter, and its flowers tucked away in the hart of this rosette, that is lacking latex, and does not have thorns. Two sources report twenty chromosomes (2n=20), but one other publication says eighteen (2n=18).  Leaves  The leaves are simple and are arranged in a dense basal rosette. They are narrowly lanceolate to narrowly ovate in shape, more or less V-shaped in cross-section, lack leaf stalks and have a smooth surface. The tip is pointy or gradually narrowing. The leaf margins may carry some small, distanced teeth.  Subterranean flower heads  The flower heads that develop underneath the leaves do not open and are self-pollinated. Each floret is fully enclosed in its involucral bracts, and the corolla shows very little development. The cypselas are relatively large and flattened, blackish in color, with ample hairs, and remain below the soil surface after the plant has died. Any pappus consists of somewhat scale-like bristles, hardly developed or is entirely absent.  Aerial flower heads  The aerial flower heads are congested in the center of the leaf rosette, more or less arranged as a low cauliflower. Groups of florets are either functionally male or functionally female. The involucral bracts are overlapping in several series, papery, whitish and have an pointy tip. The aerial flower heads have some semblance to a hedgehog and the hard, dry plants hurt the naked foot if stepped upon.  Male florets  The functionally male florets occur in small groups and have very short individual stems, mostly in the centre of a larger cluster of female florets. The corollas are small, have (three or) four triangular lobes, greenish yellow and contain (three or) four stamens, carry yellowish or purplish anthers that are blunt on both ends and the filament is not extended beyond the anther. The fruit at the base of the male flower is much reduced and void, and pappus may consist of some irregular scales or be entirely abstent. Pollen is globe- shaped and has three sunken furrows (a type called tricolpate). These furrows have sharp ends and do not merge at the poles. The pollen has some unevenly distributed hollow spines, which are conical with a somewhat swollen base and a pointed tip, 1‚Äî2 Œºm high.  Female florets and fruits  The functionally female florets are each stiffly enclosed by a large, cone-shaped green and white bract, and clustered with other one-flowered female flower heads, mostly surrounding groups of male florets. The inconspicuous corolla consists of whitish threads and surrounds the base of a whitish style with long arms which have rounded tips. The one-seeded indehiscent fruit (or cypsela) of the female florets are tiny, ovoid, with rows of stiff hairs on the ribs, and felty overall with long twin hairs, which have thin cell walls. The pappus on top consists of scales ending in a long drawn tip and with a row of hairs along the edges.  Characters in common with Cavea  Gymnarrhena is most related to Cavea, but few morphological features would support this assignment, other than both having two types of flower heads and sharing a tendency towards dioecism. Both also have basal leaf rosettes, stretched leaves, with few spaced teeth on the margin, and both lack spines and latex.  Differences with other Asteraceae  Gymnarrhena has aerial inflorescences that consist of many individual flower heads with disk florets which are either functionally male, with few florets each, or female with one floret only. This is a rare character combination, that is further known from the inflorescences of Gundelia. The latter however is a much larger, erect, thistle-like plant, which has latex and pentamerous florets. In Gymnarrhena the male florets (the only ones where a judgement can be made without enlargement) are (tri- or) tetramerous. The vast majority of Asteraceae have pentamerous florets, and several to many florets per flower head. Other asterids that have flower heads with only one floret are Corymbium, Hecastocleis shockleyi, Stifftia uniflora and Fulcaldea laurifolia, but these are pentamerous and hermaphrodite.  Taxonomy  specimens with and without aerial flowersGymnarrhena micrantha was first described by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1818. In 1857, a second species, G. balansae was distinguished by Ernest Cosson and Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve, but it is doubtful this form from Algeria is sufficiently different. In 1868, the name Cryptadia euphratensis, with a description by John Lindley, was published, cited on but this name was later synonymised with G. micrantha. The unusual morphology of Gymnarrhena has made it difficult for taxonomists to make a solid assignment. Bentham, Hoffmann, and Cronquist put this genus in the Inuleae tribe in its widest circumscription, while both Hoffmann and Cronquist note Gymnarrhena is similar to Geigeria. In 1973, Peter Leins thought the pollen of Gymnarrhena too different from the Inuleae and proposed a position in the Cynareae tribe. John J. Skvarla, Billie Lee Turner, and their colleagues in 1977 agreed that Gymnarrhena has some traits in common with the Cynareae but a pollen type that cannot be found in the Inuleae tribe. K√•re Bremer in his 1994 book Asteraceae: Cladistics & Classification included Gymnarrhena in the Cichorioideae, but without clarifying its position in this tribe.  Modern classification  Gymnarrhena micrantha is now considered the sister group of Cavea tanguensis, who together constitute the tribe Gymnarrheneae and the subfamily Gymnarrhenoideae.  Phylogeny  Based on recent genetic analysis, it is now generally accepted that the Pertyoideae subfamily is sister to a clade that has as its basal member the Gymnarrhenoideae, and further consists of the Asteroideae, Corymbioideae and Cichorioideae. These three subfamilies share a deletion of nine base-pairs in the ndhF gene which is not present in Gymnarrhena micrantha. Current insights in the relationships of Gymnarrhena to the closest Asterid subfamilies are represented by the following tree.  Evolutionary processes  The early production of few large seeds followed by production of many small seeds may have been the result of the variable and unpredictable growing season, fitting to a pioneer species.  Etymology  The genus name Gymnarrhena may be a contraction of two Greek words, Œ≥œÖŒºŒΩœåœÇ (gymnos) meaning \\"naked\\" and ·ºÑ·ø§·ø•Œ∑ŒΩ (arrhƒìn), \\"male\\", while the species epithet micrantha is a contraction of the Greek words ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ (mikr√≥s), \\"small\\" and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (√°nthos), \\"flower\\".  Distribution and habitat  a herbarium specimenGymnarrhena is known from North Africa, such as Algeria and Egypt, the Middle-East, such as Sinai, Israel, Jordan, Siria, Kuwait, eastern Saudi- Arabia, Quatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan (Balochistan). It grows on gravel plains, stony or rocky areas, in thin sandy deposits, alluvial plains and wadis.  Ecology  Gymnarrhena is a dwarf herbaceous winter annual plant. It is said to be poisonous and animals appear to avoid it. It has aerial flowers in March, April and - when sufficient moisture is around - May. Already after four leaves have grown, underground flowerheads develop that produce few larger cypselas, followed later on by many small cypselas from the aerial flower heads for as long as moisture is available. When the plant dies down in summer, the cypselas remain encased between the hardened bracts, presumably safe from harvester ants. After the first rain, which usually occurs the next winter, the bracts and pappus on the aerial flowerheads unfold, and the cypselas are dispersed by the wind, while many are gathered by ants. The cypselas in the underground flowerheads however germinate through the dead parts of the flowerhead, and remain protected against the ants. These seeds increase the chance that the plant continues its presence in a location that was favorable in the previous year. Aerial cypselas on average only weigh 5‚Äì6% of a subterranean fruit. After six days, seedlings of subterranean fruits are six times larger than those of aerial fruits and their survival rate is much higher. In very dry years, only subterranean fruits may develop and aerial florets may be entirely absent. Gymnarrhena is one of few species that grows where the sand has blown out from under tar tracks in Kuwait after the Gulf war, a strong confirmation of its ability to colonize disturbed habitat quickly. At Khirbet Faynan, in the southern Jordanian desert, Gymnarrhena grows on slag piles containing copper and lead and accumulates these heavy metals.

Jacob Abraham \\"Jack\\" Stachel (19001965) was an American Communist functionary who was a top official in the Communist Party from the middle 1920s until his death in the middle 1960s. Stachel is best remembered as one of 11 Communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, for which he served a sentence of five years in prison. Biography Early years Jacob Stachel, known to all his contemporaries by his nickname \\"Jack,\\" was born of ethnic Jewish parents on January 18, 1900 in Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.According to a 1963 FBI report, the birthdate of Feb. 8, 1900 has also been claimed. See: R.F. Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA, Central Research Matter,\\" U.S. Department of Justice, Report of May 9, 1963; pg. 97. His father emigrated to America in August 1910 and young Jacob arrived with his mother and three siblings in January 1911, landing in New York City and making a home there. His father was a naturalized citizen of the United States, on which basis Jack Stachel claimed American citizenship for himself.Jack Stachel, Testimony to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, September 27, 1945; pg. 36. Stachel attended public school in New York City, selling newspapers and working in restaurants to help support the family.Bertram D. Wolfe, A Life in Two Centuries: An Autobiography. New York: Stein and Day, 1981; pg. 492. He obtained 8 years of elementary schooling and 2 years of high school before leaving.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA,\\" pg. 98. Stachel furthered his education on his own time, attending various courses at the Cooper Union and other institutions in New York City from 1915 through 1921. Stachel also briefly made his living as a \\"medicine man,\\" a seller of patent medicine to passersby through sidewalk orations. He later learned the trade of hatmaking and was an active member of the Cap and Millinery Workers Union for several years dating from 1918. Political rise Stachel left the Socialist Party of America to join the Communist Party ‚Äî then known as the Workers Party of America ‚Äî in the fall of 1923.Jack Stachel, Testimony to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, September 27, 1945; pg. 37. During the second half of the 1920s, Stachel was a loyalist to the faction headed by C.E. Ruthenberg and Jay Lovestone. In 1924, Stachel served as the District Organizer of the Young Workers League (YWL) for New York. He was also elected a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the YWL by that organizations 3rd Convention, held in October 1925. During 1926 and 1927, Stachel acted as the Organizational Secretary of the Communist Party's important New York District, working there with District Organizer William Weinstone. Stachel was a close political ally of Weinstone in this period and he was won over to his mentor's idea of following a non- factional policy, cooperating with a third group headed by James P Cannon in an attempt to end the war between the Ruthenberg-Lovestone and the Foster- Bittelman factional groups.James P. Cannon, The First Ten Years of American Communism: Report of a Participant. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962; pg. 176. Factional leader Jim Cannon later lamented that \\"after several months of persistent effort Lovestone finally got Stachel back into line. But there was one brief period in the life of this man, which seemed to be otherwise devoted exclusively to vicious factionalism, when he responded to higher considerations of party interests.\\"Cannon, The First Ten Years of American Communism, pg. 176. Stachel was elected to the 37 member Central Executive Committee of the Workers (Communist) Party of America in 1926, retaining a seat on that body until 1940 amidst the factional tides. He was made a member of the party's national Agitation and Propaganda Committee in 1927. Stachel married Bertha Zunser, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, in June 1927.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA, Central Research Matter,\\" pp. 103-104. The couple had one son, who followed his parents into the Communist movement, teaching at the party's Jefferson School of Social Science from 1954 to 1956.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA, Central Research Matter,\\" pg. 104. Association with Jay Lovestone Stachel was a top assistant to party leader Jay Lovestone in 1928, serving as Organizational Secretary of the Communist (Workers) Party. Stachel was also named the director of the party's pamphlet publishing house, Workers Library Publishers, from the time of its inception in 1928. Historians Irving Howe and Lewis Coser have characterized Stachel in this period as the \\"chief assistant in Lovestone's less savory projects\\" and charge that he \\"planned and led a raid upon the private apartments of the Trotskyist leaders, rifled their files, and stole whatever was likely to burn well in the factional fires.\\"Irving Howe and Lewis Coser with Julius Jacobson, The American Communist Party: A Critical History (1919-1957). Boston: Beacon Press, 1957; pp. 167-168. The primary source of this information, former factional associate Benjamin Gitlow, notes that the burglary of James P. Cannon's residence was conducted by Stachel and a party comrade named Ravitch, business manager of the Daily Worker.Benjamin Gitlow, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1940; pg. 491. The records stolen were then examined by Lovestone, John Pepper, and Stachel at Stachel's residence, with documents deemed damning subsequently published in the party press. In 1929, when Lovestone went to Moscow as part of a 10-member committee to appeal the decision of the Comintern to end American factionalism by reassigning Lovestone and factional opponent Alexander Bittelman to Comintern work abroad, Lovestone entrusted Stachel and Robert Minor with a code that would enable them to seize the party's assets from any new party leadership should trouble develop during the trip to Russia.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 19. The pair had betrayed Lovestone, however, revealing the plot to others in the party ‚Äî a decision which put the two back in good graces with the Communist International when the Lovestone group was purged from the party organization later in 1929. Depression-era activity Stachel was employed during 1930 as the CPUSA's District Organizer in Detroit, where he was briefly arrested along with the party's General Secretary, Earl Browder.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA,\\" pp. 98-99. He would return to New York City in 1931 to become the top assistant of William Z. Foster in running the party's trade union section, the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL).Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 26. Foster found himself on the mend after a serious heart attack and stepped back from political life during the middle 1930s. Stachel filled the void as acting head of TUUL from 1932 through 1934, becoming the formal head of the organization in 1935.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA,\\" pg. 99. Stachel's tenure as the acting head of TUUL coincided with a burst of activity of that organization in strike actions. According to the Communist Party's own reckoning, some 900,000 American workers went on strike in 1933, three times the total of the previous year. Of these, approximately 200,000 strikers were represented by unions linked to TUUL, compared to 250,000 represented by independent unions, and 450,000 represented by unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.William Z. Foster, History of the Communist Party of the United States. New York: International Publishers, 1952; pg. 298. In 1933, with Earl Browder's ascension to the top position in the CPUSA, Stachel was taken into the top leadership of the party, along with Charles Krumbein (New York District Organizer), Bob Minor, Gil Green, and Herbert Benjamin.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 88. Arrests and imprisonment Stachel was actively sought by the federal government in the fall of 1939, in hopes that he might be compelled to testify against party leader Earl Browder who faced charges of passport fraud. Alerted to the government's desire to take him into custody, Stachel went underground, disappearing from the radar of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from October 1939 until February 1942, by which time America had entered the war and the political climate faced by the Communist Party had changed. After his reappearance, Stachel was made Associate Editor of the Communist Party's English-language newspaper, the Daily Worker ‚Äî a post in which he remained until October 1945. Following his departure from the Daily Worker, Stachel was appointed Chairman of the CPUSA's \\"Education, Agitation and Publications Department\\" (AgitProp), which job he formally held through 1950. Following the end of World War II the brief period of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States came to an abrupt close and a new Cold War erupted, bringing with it renewed government efforts to hamstring the American Communist Party and its leaders. Stachel was arrested on June 1, 1948 on a deportation warrant obtained by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, which charged him with illegal entry into the United States as well as membership in an organization which advocated the overthrow of the US government through \\"force and violence.\\" He was released on bail that same day. This deportation matter was suspended the following month when a new and more onerous charge arose. On July 20, 1948, \\"stocky Jack Stachel\\" was one of 12 \\"kingpin Commies\\" (to borrow colorful contemporary terminology from Time magazine) indicted under the Smith Act for being \\"dedicated to the Marxist-Leninist principles of the overthrow and destruction of the Government...by force and violence.\\"\\"Communists: The Top Twelve,\\" Time, August 2, 1948. Although the Smith Act had been implemented eight years earlier for the altogether different purpose of fighting potential infiltration of America by secret Nazi saboteurs, in the fearful atmosphere of the Second Red Scare the existing law was used as a tool against national officials of the Communist Party. Prosecution of the ailing 67-year-old William Z. Foster was eventually dropped, but the 11 others, Jack Stachel among them, were convicted in 1949 and sentenced to five years in prison. Stachel was additionally slated for deportation proceedings upon his release ‚Äî an action which proved unenforceable for geographic reasons.David Caute, The Great Fear: The Anti-Communist Purge under Truman and Eisenhower. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978; pg. 234. Stachel suffered a heart attack of his own in January 1950, for which he was hospitalized in New York City for more than a month.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA, Central Research Matter,\\" pg. 100. Stachel was imprisoned at Danbury Federal Penitentiary in Danbury, Connecticut from July 2, 1951 to March 1, 1955 in connection with his Smith Act conviction.Smith, \\"Who's Who of National Leaders, Communist Party USA,\\" pg. 100. Career after prison Upon his release Stachel was returned to the top leadership of the CPUSA, first as a member of the CPUSA's National Trade Union Commission. He was elected to the party's governing National Executive Committee in 1957. He also served as business manager and editor of The Worker, the renamed official party newspaper, from 1957. During the Communist Party's period of internal discord following the so-called Secret Speech of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Stachel cast his lot with the CPUSA's pro-Moscow loyalists, including Eugene Dennis and Gus Hall. Stachel's loyalty was rewarded with elevation to the inner circle controlling the CPUSA's daily affairs, including promotion to the National Board in March 1961 and the National Administrative Committee in February 1962. Stachel also remained closely attached to The Worker as that publication's Press Director. Stachel suffered from a heart ailment.David Caute, The Great Fear, pg. 209. Death and legacy Jack Stachel died on December 31, 1965, of a heart and kidney ailment.\\"Jack Stachel, U.S. Communist And Party Official, Dies at 65,\\" New York Times, January 2, 1966, pg. 73. He was less than three weeks short of his 66th birthday at the time of his death. Following his death, Jack Stachel's life work was effusively extolled by CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall in a five-page memorial in the party's monthly magazine, Political Affairs. Hall called Stachel \\"a model of a patriot\\" who \\"not only disapproved of evil, he fought it.\\"Gus Hall, \\"A Single-Minded Son of the Working Class,\\" Political Affairs, vol. 45, no. 2 (June 1966), pp. 17-19. Although he did not provide any concrete detail about either the social origins, personal life, written ideas, practical achievements, or political career of the little-known functionary, Hall nevertheless lauded Stachel as \\"one of the finest Marxist thinkers\\": > \\"The name, Jack Stachel, shines brilliantly on the roll of honor of the > heroes of the working class struggle. He will be remembered and honored the > world over as one of the architects and builders of the new social order ‚Äî > socialism. > > \\"Jack Stachel's monument is the people and the better world he helped to > build. His Hermitage is the thousands of young rebels who will try to match > his greatness, who will emulate him because they saw in his life's work ‚Äî a > model.\\"Hall, \\"A Single-Minded Son of the Working Class,\\" pg. 20.

Season summary For its first season, Kim Hak-Cheol was the designated captain, and Daegu brought in two Czech players, Roman Gibala and Jan Kraus for the season. Another import was Turkish player Rahim Zafer, a former Turkish international defender who was in the twilight of his career. Indio transferred in midseason to Daegu from Brazilian club Esporte Clube Santo Andr√©. Some of the key Korean foundation players included Lee Sang-il, who had played domestic football in Belgium, and Park Jong-jin who has played all his domestic football with Daegu, bar a two-year spell with Gwangju Sangmu when undertaking his military service. Many of the Korean foundation players came to the club via University Football clubs, which meant that Daegu was their first experience of professional football. The K-League structure for 2003 required each team to play 44 matches, making for a long drawn out season. Daegu ultimately finished their first season 11th (out of 12 teams) in the league, winning 7 games, and drawing 16. In the 2003 Korean FA Cup, Daegu FC, as participants in the K-League, automatically qualified to the playoff phase (round of 32). However, their wins at this stage of the competition were against National League sides and university club teams. In their quarterfinal match, against their first serious opponent, and fellow K-League club Ulsan Hyundai Horangi, they were knocked out in a 1-nil result.

They released three albums during their existence, Country Home (1970), Ace of Sunlight (1971) and Smoking Mixture (1973). History Bronco were formed in August 1969 by Jess Roden following his split from The Alan Bown Set. They were signed to Island Records by Guy Stevens and, after initially recording tracks at Olympic Studios with him, recorded their first album, Country Home, at Island's own Basing Street Studios during 1970, with the final mix being overseen by Paul Samwell-Smith. One of the album's tracks, \\"Love\\" was included on Bumpers, an Island sampler album. The group similarly recorded their second album Ace of Sunlight at Basing Street (1971) which was produced by the band and Richard Digby Smith. Singer-songwriter Clifford T. Ward guested on their debut album Country Home. Trevor Lucas sang back-up vocals on Ace of Sunlight, and both Ian Hunter and Mick Ralphs from Mott The Hoople also guested on that album. In January 1971, Bronco appeared on BBC Two's Disco 2. Rock On TV: Disco 2 . Retrieved 5 November 2013 Following a serious motorway accident between Cheltenham and Bristol (in which the group's crew ‚Äì Dick Hayes and Alan Stone ‚Äì and drummer Pete Robinson and bassist John Pasternak were badly injured) and a later, ill-fated West Coast of America tour, Roden left the band after a final British tour with label-mates Mott The Hoople and John Martyn in the early 1972, to start a solo career. Guitarist Robbie Blunt soon followed and the remaining members drafted in Paul Lockey on vocals (who Kevyn Gammond knew from Band of Joy) and Dan Fone on guitar. This incarnation of Bronco signed to Polydor and released one album, Smoking Mixture. Bronco's bass player John Pasternak died of a heart attack in September 1986. Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant fronted a tribute event for Pasternak in December of that year, that featured Plant and The Big Town Playboys, and concluded with an ensemble band featuring Plant, Jimmy Page on guitar and Jason Bonham on drums. Two Bronco tracks are featured on Island records compilation albums: \\"Love\\" appeared on Bumpers released in 1970 and \\"Sudden Street\\" was on El Pea (1971). \\"Time Slips Away\\" was included on the Island Records compilation Meet on the Ledge, released as part of Island's 50th anniversary in 2009.

History right right thumb thumb thumb The slaughterhouse was originally located in Hung Hom, occupying which could hold 120 head of cattle, 200 lambs and 400 pigs.APART, \\"Cattle Depot Artist Village \\" It was moved to Ma Tau Kok in To Kwa Wan due to the construction of Kowloon-Canton Railway. The former Ma Tau Kok Quarantine Depot () was built in 1908. It was owned by the government and was used as a cattle quarantine and slaughter centre for more than 90 years. Central planning and development occurred throughout the years and people started to reside at Ma Tau Kok. In 1999, the old Ma Tau Kok Cattle Depot was finally closed down due to expressed concerns by the neighbouring residents about hygiene problems deriving from a slaughterhouse in the urban area. It was replaced by a new slaughterhouse in Sheung Shui. Architecture Built in 1907-08, elements of Western architecture are found. The site was made up of 5 blocks of distinctive red-brick buildings, offering a total space of . It has pointed roof with tiles.

As most of the tenants contribute in art work in the Cattle Depot, the place is then named Cattle Depot Artist Village. Originally, the village is leased for non- residential use. Tenants are not bound to have artistic use in the village. There are a total of 20 units for rental purposes. Now there are 5 artist groups and 9 independent artist units working in the village. Tenants can do their art work and stay in the village as their offices. They can have rehearsals, and performances open the public. Now the village is not all open for the public. 5 units remain vacant. As most of the vacant units need massive repair, they will remain closed and are not rented out. Government Property Agency is responsible for monitoring and collecting rents. The rent is $3.5 per square foot. Leases used to last 3 years in the past.

Although the Cattle Depot is not included in the scheme, the CHO has been planning to revitalize the Cattle Depot during 2009. The Development Bureau has appointed the Hong Kong Arts Development Council to carry out a study concerning the future development of the Cattle Depot. The study will evaluate the background and current situation of the Cattle Depot as a role of artist village as well as the feasibility of operating artist village in the Cattle Depot referring to the history of local and foreign artist villages. In addition, the study will also suggest how the revitalization of the Cattle Depot can have a synergetic effect on the surrounding areas including Kai Tak new development area and the old quarters in To Kwa Wan like the 13 Streets, with an investigation on the antiquities value of Kowloon City, the impact on the whole district and the possibility of exploiting a heritage trail/network. The Development Bureau is still consulting the public in terms of the conservation method and future revitalization of Cattle Depot.Commissioner for Heritage's Office, \\"Organisation Chart for Commissioner for Heritage's Office\\" Inside the Cattle Depot Artist Village Constraints faced by artists Due to the Cattle Depot being listed as a historical building, there are regulations placed on resident artists.Chan Ka Yee [Èô≥ÂòâÂÑÄ], U-Beat Magazine, \\"Âêç‰∏çÊ≠£Ë®Ä‰∏çÈ†Ü ÊîøÂ∫ú:ÁâõÊ£ö‰∏çÊòØËóùË°ìÊùë!\\" Artists are requested by the Government Property Agency to comply with various rules which may potentially inhibit the promotion of an artistic atmosphere within the Village. Artists are not allowed to paint on the walls of their own studios. Taking photographs is also not allowed. Artists are prohibited from putting plants or even their own works outside their studios. They cannot stay overnight in their studios.Ming Pao [ÊòéÂ†±], \\"ÈßêÊùëËóùË°ìÂÆ∂ÔπïÁõºÂ∞ëÈªûË¶èÁÆ° Â§öÈªûÁ©∫Èñì\\" Corridors are labelled as public space and art groups cannot conduct rehearsals along those pathways. Previously there was a stringent rule of checking visitors' HKID cards before they could enter Cattle Depot, but this has been relaxed. A Temporary Place of Public Entertainment Licence is needed for the temporary use of the units to organize public functions. In response to artists' concerns that the rigid regulations may complicate the maintenance of an artistic atmosphere, the government stated that a licence is needed because the premises are not well-equipped with fire safety and emergency access facilities. Comparison with the Fo Tan Arts Studio Young artists, e.g. arts graduates, in their twenties are renting studios in Fo Tan while large art groups and cultural bodies like Zuni Icosahedron, Artist Commune, Videotage, 1a Space and On & On Theatre Workshop Company are based in the Cattle Depot Artist Village. At Fo Tan, artists are generally more scattered, individualistic and reluctant to be labelled, while artists in the Village tend to be more organised, forming an aggregate body. They described themselves as simply a group of studios but the sense of community is already strong enough for them to hold an open studio each year. Young artists are attracted to the low rents of the Fo Tan site. It is also conveniently just one MTR stop from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, from which many of these art graduates hail.‚ÄúCreative Chaos‚Äù, The Standard, 27 Nov 2004. Cattle Depot has its own distinctiveness. Artists emjoy studios set in a quirky cultural heritage site. This is akin to the environment in some other countries where sites of historical value are reused. A visit to Fo Tan studios involves much climbing of stairs. It is rather inconvenient when compared to Cattle Depot where the red-brick houses are horizontally laid and people can get into the studios easily. Also, unlike studios located inside factory buildings, the doors are not necessarily closed all the time at Cattle Depot, there are more interactions and scope for creativity. Moreover, Cattle Depot offeres convenient access to nearby residential communities, it can take up the role of introducing developments in art to the public easily. Despite limited government promotion of Cattle Depot as a village for local artists, it is already known overseas. Journalists from China and Japan have come to report about Cattle Depot. This shows that Cattle Depot has good potential to be turned into a special and distinctive spot if there are good development opportunities. Possible developments Expanding the artists' village The Development Bureau and Hong Kong Arts Development Council, together with a relevant research centre responsible for architectural cultural heritage of the Chinese University of Hong Kong are investigating into the possibility of expanding art and cultural development from Cattle Depot Artist Village into the neighbourhood including the 13 Streets. The Development Bureau intends to seek the property management powers from the Government Property Agency, which is currently responsible for the management of the Cattle Depot.Ming Pao [ÊòéÂ†±], \\"ÁâõÊ£öÂçÅ‰∏âË°óÊì¨ÈÄ£Á∑öÁôºÂ±ï ËàäÊ®ìÁßü‰∫àËóùË°ìÂÆ∂Â±Ö‰ΩèÂ±ïË¶Ω \\", 3 May 2009 The idea is to develop Cattle Depot Artist Village together with the 13 Streets which is right opposite to it. The government would like to expand the area of the artists village into the old buildings on the 13 Streets such that part of the flats in those buildings can be rented to artists as their residence. It is envisaged that it would be very convenient for artists as they will then be living at flats nearby. It is within walking distance that they get back to their studios to continue with their work. Moreover, if the entire floor of a particular block is rented to artists, surely artists will have more opportunities for interactions, exchanging ideas about art. This helps to create an artistic atmosphere within the neighbourhood. It is also suggested that the roofs of those old buildings in 13 Streets can be used as exhibition areas by the artists to hold art exhibitions. The problem, however, is that there are a number of illegal structures on those roofs at present. Although the residents have been requested by the government to remove those illegal structures, this may still prove to be difficult given that they still have to pay a sum after receiving government subsidies for renovation purposes. Renovation of the roofs is expected to take quite a long time before the roofs can be used as sites for art exhibitions. Expanding the scope The Arts Development Council expressed the view that Cattle Depot may be better managed in the future. At present, some artists use it as store room, plant flowers on the site and do not pay any rent. The Council felt that the site has not been put into good use. In Hong Kong, the public has always argued that there is not enough venues and working space for local art groups. Since Cattle Depot is a very spacious site, it is very suitable for the performing arts. The Council wants to make best use of the site. The idea came up after the announcement of plans to turn a nine-storey government factory building in Shek Kip Mei into a centre for visual arts. Other related developments includes the establishment of the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre, which offers 100 studios to artists and arts groups for rents of HK$3‚Äì8/sqft.Quinton Chan, \\"Performing arts centre planned for artists' site\\", South China Morning Post, 26 Nov 2006 Creative industries in Hong Kong Creative industries in are divided into 11 categories: design, architecture, advertising, publishing, music, film, computer software, digital entertainment, performing arts, broadcasting, and antiques and art dealing. Some fall under the core industries, such as tourism. In Hong Kong Policy address 2005, it was mentioned that creative industries can be extended to cover areas such as community building and the creation of an urban image. In this new competitive era of globalization, adding value to products and services through design, packaging, image building and advertising serves to consolidate and realize the intangible values of culture. Strictly speaking, in Hong Kong, creative industries can be defined as \\"cultural and creative industries\\". This term clearly specifies the direction of development of creative industries.Policy Address 2005 Hong Kong has around 32,000 creative industry-related establishments, with more than 170,000 practitioners. The industry creates an added value to Hong Kong‚Äôs GDP of more than $60 billion annually. This constitutes around 4% of the GDP.(Hong Kong: The Facts, Creative Industries) It seems the government's attitude towards creative industries is very supportive. However, there are still many constraints in its development. The case of Cattle Depot can serve as an example. The government refused the long-term lease of Cattle Depot Artist Village. The lease has to be renewed every 3 months. Though the village is leased, it is still categorized as government property. Visitors cannot enter the village without permission. People who wish to enter the village need to show their HKID card for registration. This creates much inconvenience to the visitors. And the keeper of the village actually does not allow them to use the name of \\"Cattle Depot Artist Village\\". Banners are not allowed to be hung up under this name. Cultural development needs space and time. Hong Kong government has been promoting creative industry for years, but they neglect the local artistic atmosphere and the effort made by the art organizations/ artists, not to mention appreciating and supporting its development. The lack of long-term vision and supportive cultural development by the government creates much uncertainty to the contemporary art development. This is because the importance of coherence of artistic atmosphere is still in the blind-spot of government cultural development policy.‰∏âÂüé : Âè¶È°ûËóùË°ìÁ§æÁæ§, Êïò‰∫ãÁï∂‰ª£ËóùË°ì, È¶ôÊ∏Ø/Âåó‰∫¨/Êñ∞Âä†Âù° / Ë¨ùÁáïËàûËëó.È¶ôÊ∏Ø : ËóçÂ§©ÂúñÊõ∏, 2008,ÂàùÁâà Under the influence of financial turmoil, nations are undergoing economic recession.

(2009). \\"Odd New Pterosaur: 'Darwin's Wing' Fills Evolution Gap.\\" National Geographic News, 13 October 2009. Accessed 14 October 2009. Two additional species, D. linglongtaensis and D. robustodens, were described from the same fossil beds in December 2010 and June 2011, respectively. Description Restoration of a crested D. modularis Darwinopterus, like its closest relatives, is characterized by its unique combination of basal and derived pterosaurian features. While it had a long tail and other features characteristic of the 'rhamphorhynchoids', it also had distinct pterodactyloid features, such as long vertebrae in the neck and a single skull opening in front of the eyes, the nasoantorbital fenestra (in most 'rhamphorhynchoids', the antorbital fenestra and the nasal opening are separate). Darwinopterus is distinguished from its close relatives by the greater relative length of the back portion of the skull compared to its jaws, thin nasal bone, and elongated hip bone (illium). The teeth in all species were spaced widely with the longest teeth at the jaw tips. The teeth were spike-like in form, and set into tooth sockets with raised margins. The hand bones were relatively short, even shorter than the femur. The tail was long, with over 20 vertebrae, and was partially stiffened by long, thin bony projections. Unlike other wukongopterids, the head crest found in males was supported by a thin bony extension of the skull, with a serrated top edge. The serrations probably helped anchor an even larger keratin extension. Specimens of Darwinopterus have been divided into three distinct species, based largely on the size and shape of their teeth. The first, D. modularis, was named by L√º Junchang and colleagues in 2010. D. modularis had an especially elongated back end to the skull, and widely spaced, \\"spike-like\\" teeth. D. linglongtaensis was named by Wang Xiaolin and colleagues in later in 2010. It was characterized by a shorter and taller skull and shorter, cone-shaped teeth. In 2011, L√º and another team of scientists described and named D. robustodens, for a new specimen with very robust teeth. L√º and colleagues (2011) suggested that these differences in tooth shape may indicate that each Darwinopterus species occupied a different ecological niche, with the teeth of each becoming specialized for different food sources. The robust teeth of D. robustodens, for example, may have been used to feed on hard-shelled beetles. Biology Because Darwinopterus is known from numerous well-preserved specimens including an egg, researchers have been able to deduce various aspects of its biology, including growth patterns and life history, reproduction, and possible variation between sexes. Sexual variation The large amount of variation among Darwinopterus specimens has been interpreted as sexual dimorphism. The first Darwinopterus specimen in which sex could be confidently identified was specimen ZMNH M8802 in the collections of the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, nicknamed \\"Mrs T\\" (short for \\"Mrs Pterodactyl\\"), described by L√º Junchang and colleagues in January 2011. This specimen was preserved with the impression of an egg between its thighs in close association with its pelvis. This specimen had a broad pelvis and lacked any evidence of a crest. The egg was probably expelled from the body during decomposition, and its association with the Darwinopterus individual was used to support the hypothesis of sexual dimorphism.Hecht, J. (2011). \\"Did pterosaurs fly out of their eggs?\\" New Scientist online edition, 20 Jan 2011. Accessed online 21 Jan 2011, https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20011-did-pterosaurs-fly-out-of- their-eggs.html However, this hypothesis has been criticized. Pterosaur researcher Kevin Padian questioned some of the conclusions drawn by L√º et al., suggesting in a 2011 interview that, in other animals with elaborate display crests (such as ceratopsian dinosaurs), the size and shape of the crests change dramatically with age. He noted that the \\"Mrs T\\" specimen may simply have been a sub-adult which had not yet developed a crest (most animals are able to reproduce before they are fully grown). In 2015, Wang e.a. reassigned the \\"Mrs T\\" specimen to Kunpengopterus. Furthermore, a rigorous analysis of wukongopterid variation published in 2017 noted that crests among wukongopterids were subject to a large amount of individual variation, and that there was no consistent dimorphism in the pelvic anatomy of crested and uncrested wukongopterid specimens. Reproduction The specimen preserved along with an egg (nicknamed \\"Mrs T\\"), described by L√º and colleagues in 2011, offers insight into the reproductive strategies of Darwinopterus and pterosaurs in general. Like the eggs of later pterosaurs and modern reptiles, the eggs of Darwinopterus had a parchment-like, soft shell. In modern birds, the eggshell is hardened with calcium, completely shielding the embryo from the outside environment. Soft-shelled eggs are permeable, and allow significant amounts of water to be absorbed into the egg during development. Eggs of this type are more vulnerable to the elements and are typically buried in soil. The eggs of Darwinopterus would have weighed about when they were laid, but due to moisture intake, they may have doubled in weight by the time of hatching. The eggs were small compared to the size of the mother (the \\"Mrs T\\" specimen weighed between and ), also more like modern reptiles than birds. David Unwin, a co-author of the paper, suggested that Darwinopterus probably laid many small eggs at a time and buried them, and that juveniles could fly upon hatching, requiring little to no parental care. These results imply that reproduction in pterosaurs was more like that in modern reptiles and significantly differed from reproduction in birds. However, in 2015, the counterplate of the specimen was reported, IVPP V18403, which showed a single additional egg present in the body, indicating that there were two active ovaries, producing a single egg at a time. Diet Darwinopterus, like most wukongopterids, is a terrestrial pterosaur lacking speciations for piscivory; ergo, it was early on recognised to have been a terrestrial form. Originally, it was described as a raptorial hawking carnivore; however, posterior analyses have found no speciations towards aerial predation. Instead, it appears to have been a saltatorial insectivore, hopping around both in the trees and on the ground, akin to some modern songbirds.Witton, Mark P. (2013), Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy D. robustidens in particular might have preferred hard-shelled beetles. Classification Below is a cladogram following Wang et al. (2017) Implications As the name Darwinopterus modularis implies, the researchers who first described this genus saw it as evidence that pterodactyloid pterosaurs evolved from the more primitive 'rhamphorhynchoids' via modular evolution. In other words, rather than a gradual change from one body type to the other, various major aspects of pterodactyloid anatomy arose unsystematically, producing species with distinct combinations of both primitive and advanced features.

The project's mission was to send messages of hope to members of the LGBTQ community who were struggling with depression or feelings of isolation. It served as a suicide prevention awareness campaign for LGBTQ college students. The You-Are-Loved Chalk Message Project was founded at Drew University (Madison, New Jersey) in 2005 in response to personal tragedy. It went nationwide in 2009 as a suicide prevention awareness campaign for LGBTQ college students. The project continued annually each October until 2012. In May 2012, the Chalk Message Project became part of Active Minds' National Day Without Stigma program. Purpose The Chalk Message Project raised awareness about suicide prevention for LGBTQ college students According to the Trevor Project, (a 24/7 crisis intervention and suicide prevention lifeline) LGBTQ youth are four to eight times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. While little research has been done on suicide among LGBTQ college students specifically, a 2010 study from Campus Pride suggested a \\"chilly\\" climate for America's LGBTQ college students. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students in general. According to mental health advocacy groups like Active Minds, over 1,100 college students die by suicide each year. History The project first began on the campus of Drew University in 2005. It went nationwide on October 5, 2009 and was observed by universities across the country. By its sophomore year (2010), the campaign had grown considerably larger in size. In addition to gaining thousands of followers, the Chalk Message Project attracted positive reactions from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Active Minds, NOH8 Campaign, and occurred in hundreds of locations across country. In 2012, the Chalk Message Project became part of Active Minds' National Day Without Stigma programming.

Architecture  The church is a small cruciform monocoque type structure with a long west arm and semicircular eastern apse that is narrower by far than the other three arms. In the northeast corner adjacent to the apse is a \\"study\\" or prayer room. Large portions of walls and a section of the gable roof at the western end are preserved, as well as a large section of the lower-drum of a belfry that rests above the front entry. The belfry had been added in the 13th century but has recently collapsed. Four tall and thin columns stood on the rim of a lower drum and once supported a slightly narrower upper drum with a small conical dome above. A small portion of their footings may still be seen attached to the base drum. These lower and upper drums were both decorated with interwoven geometric knot designs that encircled the structural elements. There was originally a large octagonal drum and dome that stood above the center of the church before the collapse of its main roof. Close to the church to the southwest are the remains of the badly damaged main dome.

Since January 2013, Everything has been actively developed after a four-year break. This utility is released under a free software license that allows modification and commercial redistribution, requiring only attribution. Overview When Everything first runs, it creates an index of the names of every file and folder on all NTFS and ReFS volumes on the system from file metadata, in the case of NTFS from the NTFS Master File Table. By default, all mounted NTFS and ReFS volumes are indexed. Once created, the index is continually updated by the application; in the case of NTFS the updates are fetched from the NTFS change journal. Specific folders on any file system can also be added to the index, but the indexing of folders not using NTFS or ReFS will be slow, although searching using the completed index will not be. Regardless of the file system used on the indexed drives and folders, Everything searches its index for file names matching a user search expression, which may be a fragment of the target file name or a regular expression, displaying intermediate and immediate results as the search term is entered. Because Everything does not index content and, for NTFS drives, relies only on the NTFS change journal to filter file updates, the only file system activity it requires on NTFS drives is updating its index, and it uses very little memory and processor time to provide its service when only indexing NTFS and ReFS drives.

Not every veteran qualifies for a psychiatric service dog, however everyone who wants one can benefit from a companion or pet animal.  Pets for Vets Super Bond  Super Bond¬Æ is an innovative program designed by Pets for Vets. It‚Äôs a tested, step-by-step approach for Pets for Vets trainers to match an animal to a veteran based on their personality, temperament, needs, wants and expectations. The Super Bond¬Æ philosophy is individually tailored and aims to create the best possible match between an animal and a veteran. The method involves an evaluation to match the right pet to the right person and training the pet to immediately offer companionship and comfort. There are four steps in the Super Bond¬Æ program: Step One: Getting to Know the Veteran Information related to the veteran‚Äôs personality, needs, wants, expectations and lifestyle are gathered. The input helps with guiding them to the right animal for their situation. Step Two: Getting to Know the Animal Following the interview with the veteran, the animals are next. The Pets for Vets Skilled Social Companion Evaluation is used to determine the pet‚Äôs needs. The findings are used to build a temperament composite that we compare to the veterans. Step Three: Training If the matched animal is a dog, they are trained for the specific veteran using a positive reinforcement training philosophy. An approach developed by Clarissa Black, the founder of Pets for Vets, which encourages the human and animal to work together in a mutually beneficial way, based on trust and respect instead of force. Step Four: The Match The last step brings the veteran and pet finally together. Due to the earlier steps of the Super Bond¬Æ program, they should already seem to ‚Äúknow‚Äù one another and the animal is able to fit seamlessly into the veteran‚Äôs life.

Heterolepis species are shrublets, typically sprawling and about 30 cm high with moderately large yellow flowers. The flowerheads are solitary with glandular peduncles, the surrounding green bracts having membranous margins, especially in the inner rows. The ray florets are female, with a thread-like lobe opposite the ray. The disk florets are bisexual. The seeds (properly speaking the fruits) are flask-shaped, silky, with a pappus of two unequal rows of bristly, barbed scales. The leaves are alternate, typically 15-30 mm long, narrow or needle- like, sharply pointed, thick, and quite stiff, with the margins rolled under, woolly beneath. The rootstock is woody, and branches cobwebby. The plants occur mainly on rocky sandstone slopes in the mountains of the Western Cape in South Africa. The name Heterolepis is derived from two Greek words, heteros \\"different, dissimilar\\" and \\"a scale\\".Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II.

On each of the single or few stems, the species have one to three flowerheads consisting of yellow or yolk yellow ligulate florets, scaly pappus, greyish, pinnately segmented leaves in a basal rosette, and few smaller leaves on the 20‚Äì70 cm high stems. It contains two species: Hymenonema graecum, that is known from the Cyclades, and Hymenonema laconicum, which occurs in the central and south-eastern Peloponnesos.  Description  Both Hymenonema species are herbaceous perennial plants, with short glandular hairs, and a basal rosettes of pinnately segmented leaves that appears greyish due to longer hairs without glands that are pressed to the leaf surfaces. Plants may have one or few solid stems with zero to two branches, carrying few smaller leaves, the lowest pinnately segmented, and the higher increasingly simple, small and narrow. Each branch carries one flowerhead at its tip. The flowerhead consist of several overlapping rows of involucral bracts, with papery margins. The common base of the florets (or receptacle) is pitted, and carries scales near its margin. The ligulate florets are yellow and have five triangular teeth at their tip. The fruits (or cypselas) are five-angled and carry few or many rigid, appressed hairs. The cypselas are topped by the changed calyx called pappus, which consists of rigid hairs and scales in 2-3 rows, or sometimes only of scales.  Taxonomy  The earliest species that is now assigned to Hymenonema was from the Cyclades and described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus as Catananche graeca. In 1817 Henri Cassini described Hymenonema tournefortii, which is now considered a synonym of Catananche graeca L.. In 1838 Augustin Pyramus de Candolle considered C. graeca was too deviant to remain in Catananche and moved the species to Cassini's genus, recombining it with Linnaeus' epithet to Hymenonema graecum. Also in 1838, Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Louis Athanase Chaubard in their Nouvelle Flore du P√©lopon√®se et des Cyclades described Catananche graeca, but now based on a specimen from the Peloponnesos. Pierre Edmond Boissier and Theodor von Heldreich realised that the plants described by Linnaeus and by Bory and Chaubard, belonged to related but different species, therefore the last assigned name was no longer available, and hence invalid. They proposed a new name for it, Hymenonema laconium, which they published in 1875. hosted on  Phylogeny  According to recent genetic analyses, the genus Hymenonema is related to the genera Scolymus, Catananche and Gundelia. The latest common ancestor of both Hymenonema species is calculated to have occurred roughly 1.3 million years ago during the earlier Pleistocene. This results in the following relationship tree.  Etymology  Hymenonema is the contraction of the Latin hymen, meaning \\"membrane\\", and nema, a word for \\"thread\\", \\"cloth\\", \\"weft\\", probably indicating the plant has membranous margins to the involucral bracts, or the receptacular bracts (or paleas), or the branches of the style.  Distribution and habitat  H. graecum is only known from the Cyclades and doubtfully from western Crete. It grows on rocky soils, under scrubs, in dry meadows, along roads and at the seaside. H. laconicum is limited to the central and south-eastern Peloponnesos, in particular the Mainalo, Parnon and Taygetos mountains and the surrounding lowlands. It grows at altitudes of 5‚Äì1300 m in shrubland on stony soils, field margins and meadows.

Together with prints of the Panorama, it was sold to attendees of an exhibition given in the home of Thomas Pettigrew. Dale was an ensign in the 63rd Regiment of Foot, which was posted to Western Australia in 1829. He was assigned to the Surveyor-General's department, and thus spent his four years in the colony exploring and surveying Description The booklet is twenty pages describing the region surrounding Mount Clarence, including the flora, fauna, geography, geology, and the original inhabitants, at the new founded colony in Western Australia. Other remarks regarding the southwest of the continent are also included in the text. Robert Dale records the climate of the sound as \\"very fine\\", the temperature range and extremes are noted and compared with that of the Swan River Colony to the north. The topography of the region, from the coast to the Porrongurup Range, is described. At the right of panorama is a distant mountain range he identified as \\"Toolbrunnup\\". Areas of water within the harbour are distinguished from those of the ocean and the offshore \\"Islands of Breaksea and Michaelmas\\" are also named. The appearance of lakes and woods are also noted and mention is given to the Kalgan River and its immediate region. One area of cleared land in the image is noted as \\"Strawberry Hill\\",Currently the property of the National Trust of Australia the Government's attempt to establish a productive garden. An account of the new settlement, the viability of the country for agriculture and suitability for the production of wool, are presented as the text progresses. Observations on the Nyungar people who inhabited the region, several of which are included within the painting, and their cultural practices were also described. Their use of the 'native dog' for kangaroo- hunting is briefly detailed. The author identifies a man in the painting as Nakinna and discusses his brother, and his method of burial, the man known as Mokaree. Dale makes a general remark on the scarcity, and lack of beauty, of bird-life on the continent, but noted several ornamental birds found in the region. Of the other fauna he had this to say: > The animals that have been found consist of several kinds of the kangaroo > and opossum‚Äîthe native dog, which resembles the wolf or fox in shape‚Äîthe > dasyurus, a dark yellow animal with white spots, bearing some resemblance to > the cat‚Äîand a small animal lately found in the interior about the size of a > squirrel, or a yellowish colour, with light and dark shaded strips across > the hinder parts of the back, and a tongue very long in proportion to the > body. Several of the plant genera of the region, Nuytsia, Banksia, Kingia and what is locally termed as the \\"Tea tree\\", are identified and appended with short remarks. The wood of 'the Mahogany' (Eucalyptus marginata) is given especial mention, noting the great extent of its forest and recognised value, and predicts that it would become an important export. Head of Yagan by George Cruikshank, the frontispiece of the Descriptive Account The author concludes the text with a discussion of the killing of Yagan, which occurred some 400 km north at the Swan River Colony, and includes an image of that man's head. This hand-coloured aquatint portrait of Yagan by George Cruikshank was inserted as the frontispiece of the pamphlet. A letter from Pettigrew, detailing the results of a phrenological post mortem, was addressed to the author and appended as the last three pages. Background The view is from one of two large hills that straddle the township later named Albany, that nearest the entranceLater named Atat√ºrk's entrance, for the opposing commander of the Anzac Forces at Gallipoli to Princess Royal Harbour. Dale had brought Yagan's head to London, and had entered into an arrangement whereby Pettigrew was given the exclusive right to exhibit the head at his parties. Pettigrew in turn displayed the head in front of a copy of Dale's panorama, and encouraged his guests to buy a panorama as a souvenir of their evening. Thus, if Dale's panorama is intended to depict racial harmony, its purpose was contradicted by the accompanying pamphlet. It has been suggested that Dale included the information on Yagan in order to support his friend, Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Chidley Irwin, who had returned to London along with Dale in order to justify the killing of Yagan to his superiors.

All Our Mob, who had always shown plenty of speed but a tendency to wilt over the closing stages, blossomed in the latter half of his four-year-old season, in the autumn of 1994. This campaign featured a number of placings in high-class company, including the Doomben 10,000, and culminated with his first Group One win, in the Stradbroke Handicap. The then Federal Opposition Leader, Alexander Downer, tipped All Our Mob in the race, and explained that winning was what 'All our mob is going to do' against ‚ÄòMr Keating‚Äô at the next election.

The centre was built between 1988 and 1991, at a cost of $1 billion. Some years later, the centre was sold for $140 million, contributing to the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia. The park's signature attraction was a figure 8 roller coaster named \\"Jazz Junction\\", its track running overhead along the fifth level. Other attractions included dodgem cars, a carousel, a Lego Expo, giant playground, musical fountain, and train.Dazzeland ‚Äî Adelaide, 5 March 2016, Urban Exploring With the park's closure on 31 January 1998, an attempt was made to fill the upper levels with smaller, higher paying retail tenants. This soon proved unsuccessful in luring the necessary foot traffic, whereby the upper level remained vacant for many years. The remains of Jazz Junction were removed during 2003 as part of the renovation of the Myer Centre. A Fernwood Fitness Centre gym was located in part of the space during the early 2000s; as of December 2009, Fernwood had relocated to the Renaissance Centre (primarily occupied by Toys \\"R\\" Us until its closure in early 2012, being renovated to what is now Kmart, which had opened late November of that year), leaving level 4 entirely empty and closed-off to the public. In March 2013, the centre had commenced an upgrade. In August of that year, the escalators (sealed off from levels 4 and 5 since the park's closure) were removed completely, as part of the upgrade. In late 2015 it was announced that Dazzeland will return in 2016 as a venue for the Adelaide Festival of Arts.

The channel launched on 26 October 2009, replacing TMF, and ceased broadcasting on 31 January 2018. History The channel was officially launched on 26 October 2009 by Alexandra Burke, with an exclusive live performance of her single \\"Bad Boys\\". The first music video to be shown on Viva was Alphabeat's \\"The Spell\\" in The Official UK Chart Show Top 20 hosted by Sarah-Jane Crawford. It originally broadcast for 24 hours a day until Noggin was removed from the schedule and its hours were reduced to 9:00am ‚Äì 6:00am. It was further reduced to 9:00am ‚Äì 3:00am on 1 August 2011. The unused hours are now used for teleshopping. On 19 September 2011 the channel started broadcasting in the 16:9 picture format but the DOG was still set to the 4:3 picture format and appeared stretched; this was later fixed so it appears within the 4:3 safe zone. As with other Viacom channels, most 4:3 content has been stretched to 14:9. Viva dropped its free- to-view encryption on satellite on 19 March 2013, before launching on the free-to-air platform, Freesat, on 2 April 2013. On 8 October 2014, following the Viacom takeover of UK broadcaster Channel 5, it was announced that Viva would be removed from Freeview with all of its entertainment content moving to 5*. Its EPG slot was taken over by 5USA (which had moved from Freeview channel 31 for the launch of Spike) on 15 April 2015, with Viva moving to Freeview channel 74 and its broadcast hours changed to 9:00 to 11:00. The channel still broadcasts full-time on all other platforms. As of 31 July 2015, Viva moved to Freeview channel 58, and was only available to viewers who had devices which are compatible with Freeview HD, Freeview Play, YouView or EE TV in certain areas of the UK. It broadcast from 9:00 until 11:00. It moved once again on Freeview on 2 October 2015 from Channel 58 to 57. Following the establishment of a stream sharing capacity with 5USA +1, Viva extended to broadcast between 5:00am and 6:00pm on digital terrestrial television. Closure Viva ceased broadcasting on all platforms at 6:00am on 31 January 2018, with the final music video shown was Spice Girls' \\"Viva Forever\\" (1998). A day before, it was removed from Freesat, and the network's website was redirected to the MTV charts webpage. From 1 February, DTT's channel 57 began carrying a part-time placeholder broadcast of 5Spike +1.

Hanna had been awarded the Military Medal for gallantry while serving with the British Army's Royal Ulster Rifles in the Korean War. He then joined the Territorial Army and later the Ulster Special Constabulary. When the latter was disbanded in 1970, he joined the newly formed Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), a locally recruited infantry regiment of the British Army, as a part-time member. He held the rank of sergeant in C (Lurgan) Company, 11th Battalion UDR and served as a permanent staff instructor (PSI). According to Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Special Patrol Group (RUC) officer John Weir, Hanna was a leader of one of the two UVF units that planned and carried out the Dublin car bombings on 17 May 1974, which killed 26 people. Former British soldier and psychological warfare operative Colin Wallace suggested that Hanna had been the principal organiser of the Dublin attacks. Journalist Joe Tiernan confirmed this and stated that he had also directed the Monaghan bombing which occurred that same evening and claimed an additional seven lives. Military career A platoon of 11th Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers march past their commanding officer at Mahon Road Barracks, Portadown. Billy Hanna served as a sergeant and permanent staff instructor in C (Lurgan) Company, 11 UDR Hanna was born in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland in about 1929, and brought up as a Protestant. According to journalist David McKittrick in his book Lost Lives, Hanna, at an early age became \\"obsessed with guns and military paraphernalia in general\\". He began his military career in the British Army, serving in the Royal Ulster RiflesPotter p.90 where he held the rank of lance-corporal. He was awarded the Military Medal for gallantry during the Korean War. After Hanna left the regular Army, he joined the North Irish Militia, Territorial Army unit (TA) and later the Ulster Special Constabulary, commonly known as the B Specials, which was a reserve police force in Northern Ireland. Upon their disbandment in May 1970, he then became a part-time member of the newly formed Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). He was in 2 UDR's C (Lurgan) Company before it became C Company 11th Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment (C Coy, 11 UDR) in 1972. He served as a permanent staff instructor (PSI), holding the rank of sergeant, although he was for a time weapons instructor at 2 UDR's base in Gough Barracks in Armagh. According to David McKittrick and UDR historian John Potter, Hanna was dismissed from the UDR after serving two years as a sergeant \\"for UVF activity\\", however, authors Malcolm Sutton and Martin Dillon suggested he was still a member of the regiment at the time of his death. His brother Gordon served as a full-time member of the UDR. Members of militant groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) managed to join the UDR despite the vetting process. Their purpose in doing so was to obtain weapons, training and intelligence. Vetting procedures were carried out jointly by British military intelligence and the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch and if no intelligence was found to suggest unsuitability individuals were passed for recruitment and would remain as soldiers until the commanding officer was provided with intelligence enabling him to remove soldiers with paramilitary links or sympathies.CAIN Archive:Public Records: Subversion in the UDR With his previous military experience and decoration for bravery, Hanna was just the type of recruit needed. He would have been fast tracked on a refresher course to sharpen up his military skills, and would have been part of the UDR's front line of experienced soldiers when the regiment began duties in 1970.Ryder p.40 In the regimental history of the UDR the author commented on men like him and (referring to another individual) suggested that, \\"he may have regarded himself as a true blue loyalist but had so little understanding of the meaning of loyalty that he would betray his regiment and his comrades.....\\"Potter p.334 UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade Old UVF mural. Billy Hanna commanded the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade from 1972 until his death in 1975. In the late 1960s, the violent religious and political conflict known as the Troubles broke out in Northern Ireland. Many people from both sides of the religious/political divide were caught up in the violence that ensued. Hanna was no exception as attacks waged by the Provisional IRA escalated in the early 1970s, and many Ulster loyalists in Northern Ireland, feeling that their status was being threatened and the state response insufficient, sought to retaliate with illegal violence by joining one of the two main loyalist paramilitary organisations, the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA) or the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Up until his death in 1975, Hanna was the leader of the Mid-Ulster Brigade of the UVF, having established the brigade and set up the first unit in his home town of Lurgan in 1972. Hanna, who held the rank of brigadier, appointed himself commander and his leadership was endorsed by the UVF's supreme commander Gusty Spence. On 23 October of that same year, an armed UVF gang raided King's Park camp, a UDR/Territorial Army depot in Lurgan, and stole a large cache of sophisticated guns and ammunition.\\"Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster area in the mid-1970s\\". Pat Finucane Centre. Retrieved 25 January 2012 Hanna was the depot's guard commander when the raid took place. A member of the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) on the Shankill Road, Hanna was described by journalist Joe Tiernan as having been a \\"brilliant strategist and an able leader\\". Hanna's place on the Brigade Staff was remarkable in itself because since the formation of the modern UVF by Gusty Spence, almost all of the UVF Brigade Staff members have been from the Shankill Road or the neighbouring Woodvale area to the west. Hanna, a native of Lurgan, was one of the few exceptions.Anderson, Malcolm & Bort, Eberhard (1999). The Irish Border: history, politics, culture. Liverpool University Press. p. 129. A Garda S√≠och√°na document dating from 1974 to 1975 revealed that the Republic's police knew Hanna was the Officer Commanding (OC) of the Mid-Ulster Brigade's Lurgan unit. Tiernan alleged that Hanna personally recruited and trained young men from the Lurgan and Portadown areas who were \\"prepared to defend Ulster at any cost\\". Directed by Hanna, the brigade became the most lethal loyalist paramilitary group operating in mid-Ulster. He then began carrying out bank and post office robberies, and intimidated local businessmen into paying protection money to the Mid-Ulster UVF. Hanna's Mid-Ulster unit was part of the group of loyalist extremists known as the Glenanne gang, comprising members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), UDR, UDA as well as the UVF, which carried out sectarian attacks in the 1970s in the area of south Armagh and mid-Ulster referred to as the \\"murder triangle\\". The gang was allegedly controlled by the RUC Special Branch and/or British Military Intelligence. The name is derived from a farm in Glenanne, County Armagh (owned by James Mitchell, an RUC reservist),\\"Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid-Ulster Area in the mid-1970s\\" which was used as a UVF arms dump and bomb-making site. According to the 2003 Barron Report, it was Hanna who had first obtained Mitchell's permission for the UVF to use his land to store weapons and assemble bombs. In November 1973, Hanna was arrested after his home in Lurgan was searched by the RUC. He was charged with the possession of a round of ammunition and two six-volt batteries wired together which were found during the search. The Defence counsel described Hanna as a \\"former British Army soldier with a distinguished career in the Royal Ulster Rifles, having served in the Korean War\\". Former British soldier and Troubles' writer Ken Wharton suggested in his 2013 book Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1 that the accusations against Hanna having been involved in loyalist paramilitary activities were unsubstantiated.Wharton, Ken (2013). Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1. Solihull: Helion & Company. p. 106 Dublin and Monaghan bombings Planning and preparation RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir named Hanna, along with senior UVF member Robin Jackson and Davy Payne (UDA Belfast), as having led one of the two teams that bombed Dublin on 17 May 1974. Weir additionally alleged that Hanna had been the main organiser of the attacks.Seeing Red. John Weir affidavit 3 February 1999 Retrieved 11 January 2011 Weir did not join the Glenanne gang until after Hanna's death; so it was highly unlikely that they had ever met. Weir maintained he had received the information of Hanna's central role in the Dublin bombings from James Mitchell. His allegations were published in 2003 in the Barron Report, which was the findings of the official investigation into the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. The 1993 Yorkshire Television documentary, The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre also named Hanna as having been part of the Dublin bombing unit. The idea to bomb Dublin had been conceived and authorised by the UVF leadership, and the planning of the proposed car bombings took place in Belfast, Lurgan, and Portadown throughout the end of 1973 and early 1974. Hanna was allegedly put in charge of the operation and carefully chose the team of bombers who would assist him in the attacks. The men were all experts in their own field and drawn from the Mid-Ulster and Belfast brigades. Joe Tiernan claimed that Hanna appointed William Fulton as quartermaster for the bombings, but he did not indicate his source for the information. The Barron Report alleged that two months before the car bombings, instructions in making bombs were given by Hanna on Monday evenings, and that his name was on the Garda and RUC lists of suspects for the Dublin bombings.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence, and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, p.28 retrieved 3 May 2011 It was stated in the Barron Report that former British soldier and psychological warfare operative Colin Wallace also suggested that Hanna had been the principal organiser of the Dublin car bombings. The attacks took place on the third day of the Ulster Workers' Council Strike. This was a general strike in Northern Ireland called by hard- line loyalists and unionists who opposed the Sunningdale Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly which had proposed their sharing political power with nationalists and planned a greater role for the Republic of Ireland in the governance of Northern Ireland. The UVF deliberately timed the bombings to coincide with the strike. At the time the bombings occurred, the UVF was legal; the proscription against the organisation had been lifted on 4 April 1974 by Merlyn Rees, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in an effort to bring the UVF into the democratic process. It would once more be banned by the British Government on 3 October 1975. In July 1993, a Garda detective received information from a reliable source that on 15 May 1974, a meeting had taken place inside the Portadown Golf Club in connection with the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) strike; the same informer added that a separate meeting was held in the club which was attended by Hanna and Samuel Whitten, a suspect in the Monaghan bombing. Hanna and Whitten were both regular customers at the golf club and were often accompanied by RUC officers. Tiernan said in his book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, that the Monaghan bombing, which took place 90 minutes after the Dublin explosions, was executed by loyalists working under the direction of Hanna. According to Tiernan, a few days before the bombing, Hanna had visited a pub in Portadown to check that everything was in place for the operation to be carried out. The Monaghan bombing had been organised as a diversionary tactic to draw Garda√≠ away from the border, enabling the bombers to cross back into Northern Ireland undetected. According to submissions received by Mr. Justice Barron, the Monaghan bomb was assembled at the home of high-ranking UVF member Harris Boyle in Portadown.On 31 July 1975, Boyle would be blown up when the bomb he and Wesley Somerville had loaded onto the Miami Showband's minibus exploded prematurely. Alleged links to Military Intelligence It was alleged by Tiernan that Hanna was used as an agent by British Military Intelligence, and that his Army handlers often took Hanna on fishing trips to the Corbet Lough outside Banbridge. Middle-ranking officers of the Intelligence Corps based at Army headquarters in Lisburn were frequent visitors to his Houston Park home in Lurgan's Mourneview estate. They provided him with weapons and petrol for his car. He also invited regular soldiers to his house for \\"cups of tea\\". Tiernan also stated that he discovered through personal contacts with former UVF associates of Hanna the names of four British Army officers and one RUC Special Branch officer who helped him plan the 1974 car bombings and who were also involved in earlier attacks in Dublin which had taken place in 1972 and 1973. These UVF men, from the Portadown and Lurgan areas as well as Belfast, had taken part in the Dublin and Monaghan attacks; they all confirmed that Hanna was the mastermind behind the bombings and that army officers were involved in the operation. On pages 89 and 90 of his book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, Tiernan wrote > One former UVF man now in his seventies, who was a member of Billy's squad > and whom Gardai named as having been involved in the Dublin bombings, told > me during research for this book that Billy worked as a UVF agent for army > intelligence officers in Lisburn. He said two middle-ranking officers in > plain clothes travelled down from Lisburn once a fortnight in a van to meet > Billy and give him instructions on what they wanted done.

Former Military Intelligence officer Fred Holroyd claimed that Hanna had contact with a Field Intelligence Non-Commissioned Officer (FINCO) who reported to Holroyd. He wasn't certain whether his FINCO was working Hanna as an agent or seeking to gain his friendship in the hope of acquiring information. Colin Wallace stated that he was told in 1974 that Hanna worked for British Army 3 Brigade. The attacks The car bomb which exploded in Parnell Street, Dublin was a green 1970 model Hillman Avenger like the one shown here. Hanna allegedly told the driver where to park it; 10 people died in this first of three blasts Tiernan alleged that on the morning of 17 May 1974, Hanna and Jackson transported the bombs across the border into the Republic of Ireland in the latter's poultry lorry having retrieved them from James Mitchell's farm in Glenanne where they had been constructed and stored. After meeting up with the rest of the UVF bombing team at the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the northern outskirts of Dublin, Hanna activated the bombs and then, along with Jackson, placed them into the three allocated cars' boots. The cars had been hijacked and stolen earlier that morning in Belfast by a local UVF gang known as \\"Freddie and the Dreamers\\" which was allegedly led by William \\"Frenchie\\" Marchant.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, pp.14‚Äì15 They were subsequently driven south and delivered to the bombing team at the carpark. Tiernan suggested that Hanna had been paranoid that the Garda√≠ would stop the cars at a checkpoint. He therefore ordered the drivers to travel to Dublin by separate routes, and to make sure that there was no police presence on the roads. With the devices armed and each boot laden with its lethal cargo, Hanna then gave the final instructions to the drivers of the three car bombs and they set off on their mission towards Dublin's crowded city centre. Two of the vehicles were escorted by \\"scout\\" cars for the bombers' escape back to Northern Ireland. Hanna and Jackson meanwhile left Dublin before 4.00 p.m. to return to the north, with the bombs at that point unexploded. Upon their return they went back to the soup kitchen they were running at a Mourneville bingo hall; the UWC strike was in its third day making it extremely difficult for people throughout Northern Ireland to obtain necessities such as food. Their absence had not been noticed by the other helpers. Tiernan later interviewed an elderly woman who described Hanna as the \\"head buck cat\\" of this food parcel service.. \\"Head buck cat\\" is a Northern Irish expression similar to \\"top dog\\"; meaning a leader, boss or somebody in control. The car bombs detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, at 5.28 p.m., 5.30 p.m. and 5.32 p.m. respectively. No warnings had been given. According to military experts, the placement of the car bombs indicated \\"highly-intelligent military planning by people who knew what they were doing\\". One of the Irish Army's top bomb disposal officers, Commandant Patrick Trears, declared that the bombs were constructed so well that one hundred per cent of each bomb exploded upon detonation,Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, p.22 resulting in the deaths of 26 people, mostly women (including one who was nine-months pregnant). Most of the dead were blasted beyond recognition; one girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated and only her platform boots provided a clue as to her sex.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, p.5. Retrieved 7 October 2011 Close to 300 people were injured, many maimed for life. After the blasts the bombers fled from central Dublin in the scout cars and headed back north using the \\"smuggler's route\\" of minor and back roads, crossing the Northern Ireland border near Hackballs Cross, County Louth at about 7.30 p.m. Thirty minutes earlier, a fourth car bomb, delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit, had exploded in Monaghan, killing an additional seven people. Samuel Whitten was allegedly the driver of the car.Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, p.14 Aftermath According to Tiernan, the driver of the green Hillman Avenger, which contained the bomb that had exploded in Parnell Street, was approached after the bombings by an RUC detective acting on behalf of the Garda√≠. The driver was David Alexander Mulholland, a butcher from Portadown. Mulholland, after being threatened with extradition to the Irish Republic, named Hanna as the leader of the bombing team. Hanna and Mulholland were then offered immunity from prosecution by the Garda√≠, on the condition that they would become informers and reveal everything they knew about the bombings; they both accepted the deal. Although the British Army was aware of this, Jackson was apparently never told, due to the risk of him becoming an informer himself. According to the 2003 Barron Report, Mulholland had been identified from police file photographs as the driver of the Parnell Street car bomb by three separate eyewitnesses in Dublin during the Garda investigation into the bombings. Hanna was on the list of suspects established by both the Garda and the RUC for the Dublin bombings ;Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence, and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report), December 2003, Appendices: The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre. p.28 however, he was never arrested or interrogated in connection with the incident. No one was ever convicted of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. In the 1990s, journalist Peter Taylor questioned PUP politician and former senior Belfast UVF member David Ervine about UVF motives for attacking Dublin in 1974. Ervine replied that they [UVF] were \\"returning the serve\\". Although Ervine had had nothing to do with the bombings, he explained to Taylor that they had wanted Catholics across the Republic of Ireland border to suffer; this was in retaliation for the Protestant community in Northern Ireland, who had been victims of the Provisional IRA's intensive bombing campaign. Mr Justice Henry Barron's opening statement to Oireachtas Joint Committee on 10 December 2003, described the Dublin and Monaghan bombings as the \\"most devastating attack on the civilian population of this State to have taken place since the 'Troubles' began\\".Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women‚Äôs Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, December 2003, Appendix D, Mr. Justice Henry Barron's Statement to Oireachtas Joint Committee, 10 December 2003 For his part Hanna reacted to the bombings and his own role in them in a negative manner. According to a senior UVF figure in Armagh, who had not been involved in the bombings but who had played a leading role in a number of other operations by the Mid-Ulster Brigade, Hanna would frequently visit his house in the aftermath of the attacks and would cry about \\"all those children killed in Dublin\\". On 28 May 1974, 11 days after the bombings, the UWC strike ended with the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the power-sharing Executive. Death Hanna was shot dead after driving home to Lurgan from a function at the British Legion Club in Lurgan in the early hours of 27 July 1975. According to Martin Dillon and Irish writer and journalist Hugh Jordan, two men approached him as he got out of his car. One of them was Robin Jackson. Hanna reportedly asked them, \\"What are you playing at?\\", and Jackson produced a pistol, placed it to his temple and shot him. He then fired a second shot into the back of Hanna's head as he lay on the ground. A neighbour who was also in the car was shot in the head and seriously injured. His wife, Ann, witnessed the killing; however, she was too distressed at the time to identify the killer. Dillon claims that prior to his death Hanna had been under surveillance by the RUC Special Branch. Joe Tiernan maintained that the man who shot and killed Hanna was Robin Jackson, who then assumed command of the Mid-Ulster UVF. Sean McPhilemy's The Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland claims the Provisional IRA had initially been blamed for his killing. Hanna was allegedly shot after he had refused to participate in the UVF's planned Miami Showband attack, which Jackson had personally organised and would help to carry out on 31 July. Hanna's refusal stemmed from his purported remorse at the part he had played in the killing of \\"all those children in Dublin\\"; this was a reference to Hanna having instructed David Alexander Mulholland to park the first car bomb on Parnell Street, which killed two infant girls and eight other people when it detonated. By the time the Miami Showband ambush was in its planning stages, Hanna had already begun to distance himself from the UVF. Dillon opined that Jackson's accomplice in the shooting was UVF Major Harris Boyle, who would be blown up in the Miami Showband massacre four days later. Investigative journalist Paul Larkin in his book A Very British Jihad: collusion, conspiracy, and cover-up in Northern Ireland also said this, adding that Jackson shot Hanna after learning that he had passed on information regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Dillon suggested that because a number of UDR/UVF members were to be used for the Miami Showband ambush, Hanna was considered to have been a \\"security risk\\", and therefore had to be eliminated before he could alert the authorities. Dillon would later state that the killing had been carried out by Robin Jackson and Harris Boyle with Jackson shooting Hanna in the head at point blank range before firing a second shot as Hanna lay on the ground. According to this account Dillon maintained that Hanna's killing was purely a result of him having been labelled an informer.Martin Dillon (2003). The Trigger Men. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing. p. 25 David McKittrick in Lost Lives alleged that Jackson had killed Hanna to obtain a cache of weapons that Hanna held. Jackson reportedly later admitted that it had been \\"unfair to kill him.\\" Jackson attended Hanna's funeral where he was photographed standing beside Wesley Somerville, the second bomber who would be killed in the Miami Showband attack. Following Hanna's killing, Mulholland and his family fled to England. The RUC eventually declared the killing unsolved and closed the file on the case. Hanna's widow frequently stated that she knew Jackson had been her husband's killer.McPhilemy, p. 416 Personal life Hanna and his wife Ann had five children. None of his family members were known to be involved in paramilitary activities. His brother Gordon, also a UDR member, and other family members told Joe Tiernan that they were aware of Billy Hanna's membership of the UVF but had no idea of the extent due to their own non- involvement and had not believed he was directly involved in violence until after his death.

History The Institute was established in 1904 in Florence by Italian agronomists and tropicalists as the Istituto Agricolo Coloniale Italiano (Italian Colonial Institute), in order to promote the study and systematization of the tropical environment and agriculture and to implement vocational education and training of technicians and migrants, in the agricultural field.AA. VV. L'Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare la sua storia, Florence, 2007 The institute was very busy in the years between the two World Wars, under the leadership of Armando Maugini.AA.VV. Armando Maugini nel centenario della nascita, 1989Storia di una vita. Note biografiche di e su Armando Maugini. Bollettino della Societ√† geografica italiana. (Edited by Elena Maugini and Luigi Fabbri), 1998: 195 It studied the agricultural and economic issues of Italian colonies and trained the technicians in charge of the economic valorization of the colonies and other regions. In 1938 the institute changed its name, becoming the Istituto agronomico per l'Africa Italiana. After the Second World War, the institute shifted its focus to the technical assistance to the Italians migrating to Latin America on agricultural topics. In 1959 the Institute received its present nameLaw n. 404 of June 11, 1959 and was assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The Institute is run along the dispositions of the Law n.1612 of October 26, 1962 (), the Law n.49 of February 26, 1987, and the Decree (DPR) n. 177 of April 12, 1988. Organization The gardens with the greenhouses The IAO mandate is to study, train, advise, and support initiatives dealing with tropical and sub-tropical agriculture and environmental protection. It is active in the field of development co- operation in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. It runs agricultural development projects in developing countries, mainly on behalf of the Direzione generale per la cooperazione allo sviluppo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The institute was very active in international co-operation after the enactment of Law n. 49 (1987) framing \\"Italian Development Co- operation\\", and since then it has mainly been dealing with agricultural and rural development topics, conservation and promotion of agricultural biodiversity and the development of sustainable agricultural technologies. The IAO collaborates with agricultural institutions, research centers, academies, associations and rural communities. The institute directly funds small research programs on farming and the environment, in collaboration with research centers from developing countries and hosts vocational training courses, on such topics as irrigation and geomatics. It is endowed with a teledetection and environmental analysis laboratory and owns the Bonistallo Farm in Poggio a Caiano, in the Province of Florence. Training courses have included field stages in Tuscany, the islands of Elba and Sardinia, and in the developing countries in which the institute has field activities including Bolivia, China, Eritrea, Morocco, and Tunisia. The IAO Library was established in 1908 and specializes in tropical and sub-tropical agriculture and economics, gathering over 131,000 volumes and 800 periodical magazines. The institute has a photographic archive and a documentation center, where historic information on agriculture in the tropics, and especially in the former Italian colonies, is stored. The institute publishes an international scientific magazine: The Journal of Agriculture and Environment for International Development and several series of monographic studies. The institute hosts a training center, and botanical garden with a collection of tropical and subtropical plants.Piante Tropicali in Firenze, L. Frangioni, P. Luzzi, L. Giugnolini, 1991. Its main building hosts collections of tropical agriculture products and insects. Activities Filecabinets of the Library The Institute was involved in the several phases of the Italian overseas expansion. In the first twenty years of its existence, 1904 to 1924, it focused on the study of the natural resources and assets of Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. This orientation accrued the institute expertise in farming, technology, sociology and economics of the tropics. Such studies were intensified from 1924 to 1941, when the Institute assisted the expansion of Italian economic colonization of Africa. It participated in the elaboration of agricultural settlements plans, as well as in the training and technology transfer to Italian farmers and their families settling in the colonies. This great body of information, gathered under the direction agronomist Armando Maugini, resulted in the collection of a wide set of written and photographic documents and in the establishment of a collection of agricultural products, plants and other items, used in the training of technicians and dissemination of information. The output of the institute studies and its technical proposals were implemented in the field. In order to host the growing staff and assets of the Institute, new and spacious offices were built in Florence, still home the institute today. After the Second World War, and the repatriation of Italian colonists from Africa, the IAO collaborated with the Italian trust administration in Somalia, by supplying technical skills to the newly formed Somali federal government. It also assisted Italian farmers migrating to Latin America, who were benefited by the same services, such as training, technical assistance, investments planning, etc., created for the development of the Italian colonies. Such work was completed with the reshaping of the Institute endowments, under directors Armando Maugini, Ferdinando Bigi, and Arturo Marassi. Once the Italian agricultural migration flow faded, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Institute shifted its focus to the development co-operation policies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along the patterns established by Law n. 38 (1979) and Law n. 49 (1987). Such laws established the development co-operation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, collaborating with other scientific and technical institutions, in Italy and abroad. Since 1974, Prof. Nicola Matarrese, following the plenipotentiary Minister Ernesto Mario Bolasco, gives a decisive contribution in shaping the future development of the activity of the Institute in the framework of laws already in processing and then issued as indicated above. Matarrese leaves the direction of the IAO in 1977 to devote himself to full- time teaching of Agricultural Hydraulics at the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Bari.N. Matarrese, \\"Missione IAO: non far spegnere la candela (Dai diari 1974-1977)\\" Bari, Edizione digitale, 2010 (testo in pdf) In the 1970s, director Vincenzo Faenza strengthened the IAO in the agro-economic field. From 1983 to 1993, director Aureliano Brandolini enhanced IAO assets and human resources in the field of laboratory research, and broadened the collaboration with international and developing country research centers, in order to establish local knowledge and skills, and to fine tuning sustainable technologies on the spot. Since 2000, director Alice Perlini renewed the institute's strategy, by focusing on co-operation with civil society organizations, support to the decentralized co-operation processes, and training of Italian and foreign technicians. The continuous adaptation of the IAO to new situations and activity enhancement allowed the expansion of the collaboration network and presence of the Institute in forums where agricultural development and natural resources conservation topics are debated. At the same time, the digital classification of the institute's documentation was undertaken and internet tools, enabling a wider dissemination of the rich information heritage of the IAO, were established. The institute organizes scientific conferences and work groups, study meetings, other cultural events, and experience exchanges with other institutions in Europe and overseas.

The building itself is part of a small compound just inside the Jaffa Gate opposite King David's citadel. Consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat in 21 January 1849, it is the oldest Protestant church building in the Middle East. Its congregation is mainly composed of English-speaking Jewish Christians, with both Christian and Jewish festivals being celebrated. History Originally named the \\"Apostolic Anglican Church\\", it was consecrated as \\"Christ Church\\" on 21 January 1849 by Bishop Samuel Gobat. Three architects worked on the church: the first (William Curry Hillier) died in 1840 of typhus,Johannes Friedrich Alexander de le Roi, Die evangelische Christenheit und die Juden unter dem Gesichtspunkte der Mission geschichtlich betrachtet (11884), Berlin: Reuther & Reichard, 31892, p. 180, (= Schriften des Institutum Judaicum in Berlin; No. 9) while the second (James Wood Johns) was dismissed and replaced by Matthew Habershon in 1843. The construction of the church was met with considerable local and Ottoman opposition. Lord Shaftesbury and other prominent Restorationists lobbied consecutive Foreign Secretaries in its advocacy. On 18 March 1845 a petition signed by 1,400 clergy and 15,000 laity was presented to Lord Aberdeen in support of the project.Hyamson, Albert M., The British Consulate in Jerusalem in Relation to the Jews of Palestine, 1838-1914, , cited in Lewis, D.

Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, the Christ Church compound was also the site of the British Consulate.Crombie, A Jewish Bishop in Jerusalem, 243. The building survived the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war and the Six-Day War intact and continues to function as an Anglican church with several English, Arabic and Hebrew speaking congregations.

It also relates to inductive reasoning in modeling and decision-making. The technique has existed for decades as a heuristic approach and has more recently been given a systematic theoretical foundation. In optimization, robustness features translate into constraints that are parameterized by the uncertain elements of the problem. In the scenario method, a solution is obtained by only looking at a random sample of constraints (heuristic approach) called scenarios and a deeply- grounded theory tells the user how ‚Äúrobust‚Äù the corresponding solution is related to other constraints. This theory justifies the use of randomization in robust and chance-constrained optimization.  Data-driven optimization  At times, scenarios are obtained as random extractions from a model. More often, however, scenarios are instances of the uncertain constraints that are obtained as observations (data-driven science). In this latter case, no model of uncertainty is needed to generate scenarios. Moreover, most remarkably, also in this case scenario optimization comes accompanied by a full-fledged theory because all scenario optimization results are distribution-free and can therefore be applied even when a model of uncertainty is not available.  Theoretical results  For constraints that are convex (e.g. in semidefinite problems involving LMIs, Linear Matrix Inequalities), a deep theoretical analysis has been established which shows that the probability that a new constraint is not satisfied follows a distribution that is dominated by a Beta distribution. This result is tight since it is exact for a whole class of convex problems. More generally, various empirical levels have been shown to follow a Dirichlet distribution, whose marginals are beta distribution. The scenario approach with L_1 regularization has also been considered, and handy algorithms with reduced computational complexity are available. Extensions to more complex, non-convex, set-ups are still objects of active investigation. Along the scenario approach, it is also possible to pursue a risk-return trade-off. Moreover, a full-fledged method can be used to apply this approach to control. First N constraints are sampled and then the user starts removing some of the constraints in succession. This can be done in different ways, even according to greedy algorithms. After elimination of one more constraint, the optimal solution is updated, and the corresponding optimal value is determined. As this procedure moves on, the user constructs an empirical ‚Äúcurve of values‚Äù, i.e. the curve representing the value achieved after the removing of an increasing number of constraints. The scenario theory provides precise evaluations of how robust the various solutions are. A remarkable advance in the theory has been established by the recent wait-and-judge approach: one assesses the complexity of the solution (as precisely defined in the referenced article) and from its value formulates precise evaluations on the robustness of the solution. These results shed light on deeply-grounded links between the concepts of complexity and risk. A related approach, named \\"Repetitive Scenario Design\\" aims at reducing the sample complexity of the solution by repeatedly alternating a scenario design phase (with reduced number of samples) with a randomized check of the feasibility of the ensuing solution.  Example  Consider a function R_\\\\delta(x) which represents the return of an investment; it depends on our vector of investment choices x and on the market state \\\\delta which will be experienced at the end of the investment period. Given a stochastic model for the market conditions, we consider N of the possible states \\\\delta_1, \\\\dots, \\\\delta_N (randomization of uncertainty). Alternatively, the scenarios \\\\delta_i can be obtained from a record of observations. We set out to solve the scenario optimization program : \\\\max_x \\\\min_{i=1,\\\\dots,N} R_{\\\\delta_i}(x). \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (1) This corresponds to choosing a portfolio vector x so as to obtain the best possible return in the worst-case scenario. After solving (1), an optimal investment strategy x^\\\\ast is achieved along with the corresponding optimal return R^\\\\ast. While R^\\\\ast has been obtained by looking at N possible market states only, the scenario theory tells us that the solution is robust up to a level \\\\varepsilon, that is, the return R^\\\\ast will be achieved with probability 1 - \\\\varepsilon for other market states. In quantitative finance, the worst-case approach can be overconservative. One alternative is to discard some odd situations to reduce pessimism; moreover, scenario optimization can be applied to other risk-measures including CVaR ‚Äì Conditional Value at Risk ‚Äì so adding to the flexibility of its use.  Application fields  Fields of application include: prediction, systems theory, regression analysis (Interval Predictor Models in particular), Actuarial science, optimal control, financial mathematics, machine learning, decision making, supply chain, and management.

Established in 1960, the school enrolled approximately 730 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom one percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 27 percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education in accordance with a curriculum developed by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority; the principal is Bryce Grant. The school's sister school is the Asquith Girls High School. Activities such as music, art, drama, debating, sport and strong participation in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme are included in the co-curricular program. History The site on which Asquith Boys High School was built was originally a citrus orchard owned by the Fear family, a Hornsby pioneer family. The name \\"Asquith\\" from which the suburb north of Hornsby, and subsequently the school, takes its name, was named in 1915 after the wartime Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, H. H. Asquith, who was later made the Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Before the land was acquired by the New South Wales Government in the 1950s, the land had become a cattle and horse paddock. Originally intended to be the site of the Hornsby Technical College, the Department of Education later decided to build Asquith Boys on its current site instead. Construction of the school buildings began in late 1959 but it was realised that they would not be finished in time for the school's opening in 1960 and thus the half the first boys were housed in various sites around Hornsby while the other half were housed in Chatswood High School. By mid-1960, the A Block was complete and the school moved onto its present site on 24 June 1960. By 1961 the school had risen in size to 660 students, which was later to rise to 990 by 1962, and 30 teachers while E Block and the Assembly Hall were also completed. The first principal was Mervyn Brown, who contributed to establishing school traditions by composing the school song \\"Grow in Wisdom\\". By the time the first prefects and captains were elected in 1964, the school had risen in size to 1073 students and 54 teachers. The school was officially opened on 7 August 1964 by the director-general of secondary education, A.W. Stephens. By 1965 the science, arts and music rooms in G Block had been completed. The cadet unit was also formed in 1967, only to be disbanded again in 1973 following the end of Commonwealth funding for cadet units. The 1970s also saw various changes including an expansion of the Library as well as repairs to E Block following a classroom fire. The school's brother school is the Asquith Girls High School.

The show originates from the studios of Newark-licensed WHTZ in New York City, a Top 40 outlet branded as \\"Z100\\". The show is also syndicated through Premiere Radio Networks in over 75 markets such as Philadelphia, Miami, Cleveland, and Richmond, Virginia. The live show is available in Canada via Sirius XM Canada. The live airing of the show is weekdays from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern time, with most Central markets airing it live from 5 to 9 a.m., and other time zones further west taking the show on delay. Some stations, including WAZR, KCRZ, and WXXX, air a 5am \\"pre-show\\" (two pre-recorded segments and a phone tap) before the actual show. A \\"best of the week\\" compilation show is also carried on Saturday mornings by most stations. History While it was not created at WHTZ, the popular \\"Morning Zoo\\" format became a widely employed morning show concept based on its success at Z100 - even to the point of being implemented at WHTZ's sister station in Cleveland, rock-formatted WMMS. Essentially, the Morning Zoo formula was grafted onto their already successful morning show, and lasted until 1994. The regular segments of the program include the gossip- heavy \\"Entertainment Report\\", \\"Phone Taps\\", song parodies, and various contests. Local windows are made available for news briefs and weather, traffic reports and music.

The Collaborative Computing Project for NMR (CCPN) is a project that aims to bring together computational aspects of the scientific community involved in NMR spectroscopy, especially those who work in the field of protein NMR. The general aims are to link new and existing NMR software via a common data standard and provide a forum within the community for the discussion of NMR software and the scientific methods it supports. CCPN was initially started in 1999 in the United Kingdom but collaborates with NMR and software development groups worldwide. The Collaborative Project for the NMR Community The Collaborative Computing project for NMR spectroscopy was set up in with three main aims; to create a common standard for representing NMR spectroscopy related data, to create a suite of new open-source NMR software packages and to arrange meetings for the NMR community, including conferences, workshops and courses in order to discuss and spread best-practice within the NMR community, for both computational and non-computational aspects. Primary financial support for CCPN comes from the BBSRC; the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. CCPN is part of an array of collaborative computing projectsBBSRC Collaborative Computational Projects (CCP) and follows in a similar vein to the successful and well-established CCP4 project for X-ray crystallography. CCPN is also supported by European Union grants, most recently as part of the Extend-NMR project;The Extend-NMR project which links together several software producing groups from across Europe. CCPN is governed by an executive committee which draws its members from academics throughout the UK NMR community. This committee is chosen at the CCPN Assembly Meeting where all UK based NMR groups may participate and vote. The day-to-day work of CCPN, including the organisation of meetings and software development, is handled by an informal working group, coordinated by Ernest Laue at the University of Cambridge, which comprises the core group of staff and developers, as well as a growing number of collaborators throughout the world who contribute to coordinated NMR software development. NMR Data Standards The many different software packages available to the NMR spectroscopy community have traditionally employed a number of different data formats and standards to represent computational information. The inception of CCPN was partly to look at this situation and to develop a more unified approach. It was deemed that multiple, informally connected data standards not only made it more difficult for a user to move from one program to the next, but also adversely affected data fidelity, harvesting and database deposition.\\"The CCPN project: an interim report on a data model for the NMR community.\\" (2002) Nat Struct Biol. 9(6):416-8 To this end CCPN has developed a common data standard for NMR, referred to as the CCPN data model, as well as software routines and libraries that allow access, manipulation and storage of the data. The CCPN system works alongside the Bio Mag Res BankBio Mag Res Bank which continues to handle archiving NMR database depositions; the CCPN standard is for active data exchange and in-program manipulation. Although NMR spectroscopy remains at the core of the data standard it naturally expands into other related areas of science that support and complement NMR. These include molecular and macromolecular description, three-dimensional biological structures, sample preparation, workflow management and software setup. The CCPN libraries are created using the principles of model-driven architecture and automatic code generation; the CCPN data model provides a specification for the automatic generation of APIs in multiple languages. To date CCPN provides APIs to its data model in Python, Java and C programming languages. Through its collaborations, CCPN continues to link new and existing software via its data standards. To enable interaction with as much external software as possible, CCPN has created a format conversion program. This allows data to enter from outside the CCPN scheme and provides a mechanism to translate between existing data formats. The open-source CcpNmr FormatConverter software was first released in 2005 and is available for download (from CCPN and SourceForge) but is also recently accessible as a web application. CCPN Software Suite NMR spectra viewed with CCPN software. The illustrated spectra are from HNcoCA and HNCA experiments; used here to assign the sequence of amino acids in a protein chain. As well as enabling data exchange, CCPN aims to develop software for processing, analysis and interpretation of macromolecular NMR data. To this end CCPN has created CcpNmr Analysis; a graphical program for spectrum visualisation, assignment and NMR data analysis. Here, the requirement was for a program that used a modern graphical user interface and could run on many types of computer. It would be supported and maintained by CCPN and would allow modification and extension, including for new NMR techniques. The first version of Analysis was released in 2005 and is now at version 2.1. Analysis is built directly on the CCPN data model and its design is partly inspired by the older ANSIG.P.J. Kraulis, \\"ANSIG: A Program for the Assignment of Protein 1H 2D NMR spectra by Interactive Graphics\\" (1989) J. Magn. Reson 24, pp 627-633 and SPARKYT. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco programs, but it has continued to develop from the suggestions, requirements and computational contributions of its user community. Analysis is freely available to academic and non-profit institutions. Commercial users are required to subscribe to CCPN for a moderate fee. CCPN software, including Analysis, is available for download at the CCPN web siteCCPN Downloads and is supported by an active JISC email discussion group. CCPN Meetings Through its meetings CCPN provides a forum for the discussion of computational and experimental NMR techniques. The aim is to debate and spread best practice in the determination of macromolecular information, including structure, dynamics and biological chemistry. CCPN continues to arrange annual conferences for the UK NMR community (the current being the ninth) and a series of workshops to discuss and promote data standards. Because it is vital to the success of CCPN as a software project and as a coordinated NMR community, its software developers run courses to teach the use of CCPN software and its development framework. They also arrange visits to NMR groups to introduce the CCPN program suite and to gain an understanding of the requirements of users. CCPN is especially keen to enable young scientists to contribute to and attend its meetings. Accordingly, wherever possible CCPN tries to keep conference fees at a minimum by using contributions that come from our industrial sponsorship and software subscriptions.

He was the son of a famous and powerful traditional healer, the late Oloye Ezekiel Adesanya (alias Baba Obu‚Äôkeagbo), who lived between the 19th and 20th centuries. He was married to Rosannah Arinola Adesanya, n√©e Onafalujo, who died 2 years after the death of her husband. They were blessed with four children: Adebayo Adesanya, Oluwasegunfunmi Adesanya, Modupeola Adesanya Adelaja and Olufemi Adesanya. They have 10 grandchildren. Education Adesanya attended Ijebu Ode Grammar School, after which he worked as a teacher prior to travelling to the United Kingdom to study law at the then Holborn College of Law, Greys Inn. Early political life In 1959, Adesanya returned to Nigeria as a qualified lawyer and joined the Action Group led by Obafemi Awolowo. The same year, he was nominated and eventually elected to the Western House of Assembly to represent Ijebu Igbo constituency in the 12 December 1959 House of Representatives Election. Having qualified as an exemplar of the Action Group's core social democratic ideals, he secured another nomination to the second republic Senate. He was said to have preferred his senatorial appointment to the Governorship ticket that was originally offered to him by the Unity Party of Nigeria, a successor to the Action Group. This principle was to be further justified in the roles played by him in the effort to re-define Nigerian politics and Nigerian democracy. He was a dedicated Awoist (this being the term for a disciple of Awolowo's). He led a team of lawyers that defended Chief Awolowo against the Nigerian Federal Government's charges of treason in 1962. As \\"a leader and activist\\" In the aftermath of the deaths of Obafemi Awolowo and Adekunle Ajasin, Adesanya assumed the honorific title ' Asiwaju of Yorubaland ' and simultaneously became more active politically, allying with Bola Ige, Ayo Adebanjo, Ganiyu Dawodu, and Bola Tinubu to fight their way to victory in six states of the defunct Western region with their political party, the Alliance for Democracy. Later Chief Adesanya, under the auspices of Afenifere and the Yoruba council of Elders, led a congress of Yoruba elder-statesmen through an assembly that rose to pronounce that the convocation of a constitutional conference, where new confederating terms would be determined for the country, was necessary for the good of Nigerians. Adesanya was the deputy leader of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a pro-democracy movement formed in 1994. Turbulence and victory At the peak of military persecution, many of the then pro-democracy activists, including his leader in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), Chief Anthony Enahoro, fled the country and went into exile. Abraham Adesanya remained at home, working for the cause of the Nigerian masses alongside such figures as Gani Fawehinmi, Femi Falana, Olisa Agbakoba and a host of others. The Nigerian pro-democracy movement's victories were few and far between at this period - first, the independent press was gagged, then a number of people agitating for a return to civilian rule were arrested. Chief Adesanya acted as the champion of the ordinary Nigerian regardless of the danger to his person, persistently condemning General Ibrahim Babangida‚Äôs annulment of the June the 12th Presidential election that had been won by Chief MKO Abiola. When General Sanni Abacha, Babangida's successor, attempted to transform from a military head of state to a civilian president, Adesanya made certain that both he and NADECO remained a thorn in the General's side. When democracy was finally restored in 1999, he joined other prominent Nigerians in overseeing the transition from military rule. These feats saw both him and his group come into the international limelight, featuring in reported news and commentaries about Nigeria. On the 14th of January, 1997, Chief Adesanya's uncompromising stance in regards to military misrule led to an attempt on his life at the behest of the then head of state, General Sanni Abacha. Adesanya had just left his law chambers in his chauffeur-driven car when a team of would-be assailants (later revealed to be General Abacha's hit squad) struck. By the time that they were done, the windscreens of the car were shattered and the seats were perforated by bullets. Both he and his driver weren't injured. The car, a Mercedes-Benz, was ultimately transferred to the ownership of a Lagos museum. Illness and death In his later years, Adesanya was decidedly frail due to illness. He was ultimately incapacitated, leading to his confinement in his Apapa residence. Following this, his leadership of Afenifere adopted an advisory quality to accommodate his new circumstances. He died on the 27th of April, 2008, while having breakfast. He was 85 years old. Since his death, he has been immortalised in a number of ways, especially by the six South-Western states of Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Ekiti. References 1\\\\. Igbokue, Joe.

It was built between 1884 and 1885 for the Cavendish Spinning Company by Potts, Pickup & Dixon of Oldham. Cavendish Mill was next to the Ashton Canal Warehouse at Portland Basin. It ceased spinning cotton in 1934 and was then used for a variety of purposes before it was converted into housing in 1994.  Location  Cavendish mill was built on the site of the former Bankfield Mill, separated from Portland Basin on the final section of the Ashton Canal by the site of Tudor Mill,  History  The Cavendish Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1884 to build the Cavendish Mill on the site of the former Bankfield Mill. This was a Potts building. It was six storeys high on the canal side, and five on the other. It is a fireproof design and was the first mill in Ashton to have concrete floors and a flat roof. It is instantly recognisable by the octagonal staircase that surrounds the lower part of the chimney. It stopped spinning in 1934 and was put to other uses. It still stands.  Power  The steam engine was a horizontal twin compound by Hick, Hargreaves & Co of Bolton.  Equipment  The machinery was provided by Asa Lees; originally there were 72,360 for coarse and medium counts. Between 1911 and 1920 many of the mules were replaced by ring frames so it contained 57,172 mule spindles and 22,588 ring spindles Usage Until 1934, the Cavendish Spinning Company used the mill for spinning coarse and mediums of American cotton, after which it was used for the process of winding artificial silk from synthetic fibres on to weavers beams by the Bentinck Street Silk Works company until 1976, and then by Twinglass Limited, a double glazing company, to manufacture window frames. It is still standing, having been converted into a resource centre for the community, commercial units and 165 apartments by the Worcester-based Sanctuary Housing Association in 1994. In June 2008 ownership passed to New Charter Housing Trust, a company specialising in managing social housing in Tameside.

In the southern Europe the species is widespread from northern and central Spain to Turkey and the Caucasus. Habitat In western Europe it prefers dry to mesophilic habitats in coastal areas, sea-cliffs, open forests, grassland, chalk downland and subalpine valleys, at an elevation up to above sea level. Description Zygaena lonicerae have a wingspan of . The forewings reach a length of in the females, while they are slightly smaller in males. The forewings usually show five crimson to vermilion spots and a black basic colour, with a strong bluish or blue-green reflection. The third spot is smaller than the fourth one. Head, thorax and abdomen are black and moderately to strongly hairy. The antennae are long and slender and slightly clavate (club shaped) and tapered. The females are similar to males, but the top of the front wing is slightly rounded and the abdomen and the thorax are less hairy. However this species is very variable. Usually the moth populations in alpine areas are much larger, while those from southern Europe are darker. Narrow-bordered five-spot burnet moth (Zygaena lonicerae).jpg Zygaena lonicerae MHNT CUT 2011 0 437 Mont-Louis.jpg|Both sides Zyg√®ne des bois.jpg|Lateral with open wings Life cycle The moth flies during daytime from June to early August depending on the location. They suck nectar of the preferred blue violet flowers, such as on field scabious (Knautia arvensis), dove pincushion flower (Scabiosa columbaria), meadow knapweed (Centaurea jacea), panicle knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense), bulbous thistle (Cirsium tuberosum) and ring thistle (Carduus). The females lay eggs in July on the underside of leaves of the host plants or on plants that grow close to them. The eggs are pale yellow. The caterpillars reach a length of 19 to 28 millimetres. They are bluish green or pale yellow, with long pale hairs and a few rows of almost rectangular black spots. The larva feed on various low-growing plants, including Trifolium (Trifolium medium, Trifolium montanum, Trifolium pratense, Trifolium repens) and Lathyrus species (Lathyrus pratensis, Lathyrus linifolius, Lathyrus sativus), as well as Vicia, Lotus corniculatus, Lotus uliginosus, Onobrychis viciifolia. Larvae and pupae are occasionally parasitized by Tachinidae species (Phryxe magnicornis) and by some species of wasps. The larva eat until late summer and early winter, and continue to develop in the following year. At the end of May the caterpillars are fully grown. The not fully grown caterpillars overwinter a second time. The caterpillars pupate in an elongated or spindle-shaped yellowish or white cocoon on grasses and other plants. The colour of pupa varies from brown to black.

Some elements of the previous century have been retained, including postmodernism, polystylism and eclecticism, which seek to incorporate elements of all styles of music irrespective of whether these are \\"classical\\" or not‚Äîthese efforts represent a slackening differentiation between the various musical genres. Important influences include rock, pop, jazz and the dance traditions associated with these. The combination of classical music and multimedia is another notable practice in the 21st century; the Internet, alongside its related technology, are important resources in this respect. Attitudes towards female composers are also changing. Composition in the 21st century Like the term 20th- century classical music, \\"21st-century classical music\\" is defined entirely by the calendar and does not refer to a historical style period in music‚Äîin the sense that Baroque and Romantic do‚Äîbut rather to all art music produced since the year 2000. Musicologists generally say that we are in the postmodernist or contemporary music era‚Äîa term which covers art music written from around 1975 or 1945, depending on the historian's perspective.  History  During the 20th century, composers started drawing on an ever wider range of sources for inspiration and developed a wide variety of techniques. Debussy became fascinated by the music of a Vietnamese theatre troupe and a Javanese gamelan ensemble and composers were increasingly influenced by the musics of other cultures. Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School developed the dodecaphonic system and serialism. Var√®se, Stockhausen, and Xenakis helped pioneer electronic music. Jazz and the popular music of the West became increasingly important‚Äîboth as influences on art music and as genres of their own. La Monte Young experimented with performance art; John Cage applied the I Ching to his music; Reich and Glass developed minimalism. Music generally became more and more diverse in style as the century progressed. This trend has continued into the 21st century: in 2009 BBC Music Magazine asked 10 composers, mostly British (John Adams, Julian Anderson, Henri Dutilleux, Brian Ferneyhough, Jonathan Harvey, James MacMillan, Michael Nyman, Roxanna Panufnik, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and John Tavener), to discuss the latest trends in western classical music. The consensus was that no particular style is favoured and that individuality is to be encouraged. The works of each of these composers represent different aspects of the music of this century but these composers all came to the same basic conclusion: music is too diverse to categorise or limit. In his interview with the magazine, Dutilleux argued that \\"there is only good or bad music, whether serious or popular\\". The music of the 21st century is mostly post-modernist, drawing on many different styles and open to a great many influences. Yet it is still a struggle to encourage the public to listen to contemporary music; indeed, this is true of Indian Classical Music, too.  Musical styles and influence  Post-modernism continues to exert an influence on composers in the 21st century. Styles developed in the 20th century, such as minimalism (Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich), postminimalism (Louis Andriessen, Gavin Bryars, John McGuire, Pauline Oliveros (died 2016), Julia Wolfe), New Complexity (James Dillon, Brian Ferneyhough) and New Simplicity (Wolfgang Rihm) continue to be developed. Polystylism and musical eclecticism are growing trends in the 21st century. They combine elements of diverse musical genres and compositional techniques, often alien to the composers' own culture, into a unified and coherent body of works. Composers have often started their musical career in one discipline and have later migrated to or embraced others, while retaining important elements from the former discipline. In some cases, a composer now labelled \\"classical\\" may have started out in another discipline. For example, a specific label for John Zorn's music is difficult to choose: he started out as a performance artist and moved through various genres including jazz, hardcore punk, film music, and classical, and often embraces Jewish musical elements. All of these diverse styles appear in his works. Julian Anderson combines elements from many different musical genres and practices in his works. Elements of modernism, spectral music and electronic music are combined with elements of the folk music of Eastern Europe and the resulting works are often influenced by the modality of Indian ragas. His large-scale Book of Hours for 20 players and live electronics premiered in 2005. Tansy Davies's music also fuses elements of pop and classical music. Prince and Iannis Xenakis are both major influences. Kati Ag√≥cs' work for chorus and orchestra The Debrecen Passion (2015) surrounds settings of poetry by Szil√°rd Borb√©ly with mystical texts of Medieval Latin, Hungarian, and Georgian origin, as well as a Kabalistic prayer. Composers are influenced from around the world. For example, in 2002, La Monte Young, along with Marian Zazeela, and senior disciple Jung Hee Choi founded the Just Alap Raga Ensemble which performs Indian classical music of the Kirana Gharana and merges the traditions of Western and Hindustani classical music, Young applying his own compositional approach to traditional raga performance, form, and technique.Young, L., & Zazeela, M. (2015). \\"The Just Alap Raga Ensemble, Pandit Pran Nath 97th Birthday Memorial Tribute, Three Evening Concerts of Raga Darbari\\". MELA Foundation, New York. Other composers have also drawn upon diverse cultural and religious influences. For example, John Tavener (died 2013) drew his inspiration from eastern mysticism and the music of the Orthodox Church and James MacMillan is influenced by both traditional Scottish music and his own Roman Catholic faith. In a more abstract manner, religious and mystical associations are also found in the works of Sofia Gubaidulina, a devout member of the Russian Orthodox church. The influence of electronic music, numerology, unusual instrumentation and improvisational techniques are also apparent. Marxist songs serve as basic material for Konrad Boehmer in many works. Roman Turovsky-Savchuk is influenced by his Ukrainian heritage and Baroque music. He composes for the lute, orpharion and torban, and is an advocate of musical historicism and has collaborated with Hans Kockelmans and the New York Bandura Ensemble led by Julian Kytasty. Tan Dun, best known for his scores for the movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, attempts to connect Buddhist, Christian and other cultures in his works. His works often incorporate audiovisual elements Composers find inspiration from other sources, too. The music of John Luther Adams (an Alaskan environmentalist and no relation to the other John Adams discussed in this article) is informed by nature, especially that of his native Alaska. His Pulitzer Prize-winning symphony Become Ocean was inspired by climate change. Frank's House by Andrew Norman tries to evoke the architecture of Frank Gehry's house in Santa Monica. P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s employs a variety of timbres and sound-worlds within his music. Extended techniques such as over-pressure bowings coexist with lyrical folk songs and synthesized sounds. Composers have even created mashups, more commonly found in pop music. Jeremy Sams' The Enchanted Island is one example: he draws from Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau, and other Baroque composers to create a combination of pasticcio and musical collage which also combines the baroque and the modern in its staging and costume. According to A History of Western Music, \\"it calls into question ideas of authorship and originality, making it a thoroughly postmodern work\\". The music of Osvaldo Golijov often combines the classical, modern and popular traditions within a single work juxtaposing contrasting styles‚Äîan important trend in the music of the 1960s onward.  Opera  John Adams, George Benjamin, Osvaldo Golijov, Crist√≥bal Halffter, James MacMillan, Einojuhani Rautavaara (died 2016), Kaija Saariaho, Karlheinz Stockhausen (died 2007), and Judith Weir have all made important contributions in this field: * Licht, Stockhausen's cycle of seven operas, begun in 1977, was completed in 2003 with the opera Sonntag aus Licht. * Weir's opera Armida was premiered on television, rather than on stage. Channel 4 commissioned the work in 2005. The libretto, also written by Weir, updates Torquato Tasso's 1581 epic poem, La Gerusalemme liberata, setting it in a modern Middle-East conflict which alludes to but never specifically mentions the Iraq War. Weir's opera calls for props that could not be used practically in an opera house, such as a helicopter. * Doctor Atomic by Adams (which covers Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the building of the first atomic bomb). Oppenheimer's aria Batter my heart blends post-minimalist techniques with an expressive vocal line recalling 19th-century opera. In October 2008, just before the premiere, Adams told BBC Radio 3 that he had been blacklisted by the U.S. Homeland Security department and immigration services, probably because of controversy surrounding his 1991 opera The Death of Klinghoffer, which was based on the hijacking of the passenger liner Achille Lauro by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985 and the hijackers' murder of wheelchair- bound 69-year-old Jewish-American passenger Leon Klinghoffer. * Saariaho's L'amour de loin uses her spectralist-influenced orchestral style to tell the story of 12th-century troubadour Jaufr√© Rudel. In the last tableau of Act IV, the modernist technique of cells based on arrays of semitones and tritones within perfect fifths is applied to the melodic material, while troubadour songs are evoked in the patterns of repeating phrases and the melodic style of short phrases focussed around certain pitches. Thus, 12th- and 20th-century musical ideas are fused in a unique manner. * The Spanish composer Halffter wrote his second and third operas, Lazarus (2008) and Schachnovelle (2013), both for the Kiel Opera House. * Golijov's Grammy-award winning Ainadamar (2005) is about the murder in 1936 of Spanish poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca by the Fascists. The score combines computer music, musique concr√®te and modernist dissonance with elements from Flamenco music, Latin American popular music and Cuban rhythms. * Written on Skin by Benjamin, The Sacrifice by MacMillan and Rasputin by Rautavaara are other representative works. Chamber opera is an important type of opera developed in the mid-twentieth century. They use smaller scale forces than regular operas. Examples from the 21st century include Pauline by Tobin Stokes (libretto by Margaret Atwood), The Corridor by Harrison Birtwistle, El Caballero de la triste figura by Tom√°s Marco and The Sound of a Voice by Philip Glass.  Song and choral music  Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls (2002) is a choral piece commemorating the victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003). Roxanna Panufnik's recent output includes The Song of Names and All Shall be Well. Golijov's La Pasi√≥n seg√∫n San Marcos, Gubaidulina's Johannes-Passion, Tan Dun's Water Passion, and Wolfgang Rihm's Deus Passus were all composed for the Passion 2000 project, through which the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart commemorated the 250th anniversary of the death of J.S. Bach. Golijov, being a Jew and Latin American, offered a different perspective on the Passion: he drew on African- influenced traditions from Cuba and Brazil, flamenco and Baroque music to create a work that enacts the story as a ritual through voices, dance and movement. Henri Dutilleux's last works (died 2013) include Correspondances and Le temps l'horloge, both of which are song cycles.  Orchestral works  Arvo P√§rt's Symphony No. 4, Los Angeles is the first of his symphonies to be written post-1976 and is the first of his pieces to focus on larger scale, instrumental tintinnabulation. Oliver Knussen's Violin Concerto, Op. 30, written for Pinchas Zukerman, premi√®red in 2003. Jennifer Higdon's blue cathedral, premi√®red in 2000, is a one-movement orchestral tone-poem and is ranked among the most widely performed works of the early 21st century. It was written in memory of her brother and features flute (her instrument) and clarinet (his instrument) in dialogue in their upper registers. The work evokes Debussy's more accessible form of modernism: parallel triads in strings and brass; changes in pitch set demarcating musical units, such as phrases, and providing a sense of harmonic progression; and Debussy's distinctive orchestral colour. Samuel Adler's compositions for orchestra from this century include: A Bridge to Understanding (2008), All Nature Plays (2009), Drifting on Winds and Currents (2010), and In the Spirit of Bach (2014). Samuel Adler ‚Äì Works for Orchestra on samuelhadler.com Jonathan Harvey's Body Mandala (2006) and Speakings (2008), Anna Clyne's Night Ferry, Elliott Carter's Three Illusions for Orchestra, Christopher Theofanidis' Rainbow Body, Peter Maxwell Davies's Eighth (2001), Ninth (2012), and Tenth (2013) Symphonies, and Per N√∏rg√•rd's Seventh (2006) and Eighth (2011) Symphonies are just some of the other important orchestral works produced this century.  Chamber and instrumental music  Elliott Carter (died 2012) has written a large body of music for chamber groups and soloist since 2000. These include Tintinnabulation for percussion sextet, Double Trio for trumpet, trombone, percussion, piano, violin and cello, a string trio, Hiyoku for two clarinets, as well as several new pieces in his Retracing and Figment series for soloists and Two Thoughts about the Piano. His Cat√©naires for solo piano (2006) evokes both the texture of the finale of Chopin's B minor Sonata and 20th-century serialism. Stockhausen's last major work, the unfinished cycle of twenty-four compositions collectively titled Klang, is predominantly made up of chamber- music pieces. Notable string quartets composed since 2000 include: * the quartet by Hanspeter Kyburz * the Sixth (2002), Seventh (\\"Espacio de silencio\\", 2007), Eighth (\\"Ausencias\\", 2013), and Ninth (\\"In memoriam Miguel de Cervantes\\", 2016) Quartets by Crist√≥bal Halffter * two numbered quartets‚Äîthe Fifth (2006) and Sixth (2009)‚Äîand Dum transisset I‚ÄìIV (2007), Exordium (2008), and Silentium (2014) by Brian Ferneyhough * the series of ten Naxos Quartets (2001‚Äì07) by Peter Maxwell Davies. At his death in 2016, Davies also left an unfinished final String Quartet, Op. 338, of which only the first movement was completed. The German composer Wolfgang Rihm extended his list of string quartets, first with the Twelfth Quartet (2001), the brief Fetzen 2 (2002), and a Quartettstudie (2003‚Äì04), then with a revised version of String Quartet No. 11 (2010) and the Thirteenth Quartet (2011), as well as another short work, In Verbundenheit (2014). Austrian Georg Friedrich Haas has written a Third (\\"In iij. Noct.\\", 2003) and Fourth String Quartet (2003), and the Hungarian composer Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g has also extended his series of (unnumbered) works for this medium, with Six Moments Musicaux (1999‚Äì2005), Hommage √† Jacob Obrecht (2004‚Äì2005), and‚Äîin collaboration with Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g junior‚ÄîZwiegespr√§ch for string quartet and electronics (1999‚Äì2006).  Electronic music  Electronic, electroacoustic, and computer music, pioneered in the 20th century, continue to develop in the 21st century. One of the major figures in the early development of electronic music, Karlheinz Stockhausen, composed his last electronic works‚ÄîCosmic Pulses and eight further pieces derived from it‚Äîas hours 13 to 21 of his Klang cycle (2005‚Äì2007). Mario Davidovsky has extended his series Synchronisms, which in live performance incorporate both acoustic instruments and electroacoustic sounds played from a tape. Other composers including Mason Bates, Jean-Claude √âloy, Rolf Gehlhaar, Jon Hassell, York H√∂ller, Hanspeter Kyburz, Mes√≠as Maiguashca, Philippe Manoury, and G√©rard Pape are active is this field. Bates' The B-Sides is a symphony in five movements for electronica and orchestra and Hassell's music exploits unusual electronic manipulation of the trumpet sound.  Multimedia and music  Classical composers continue to write film music: Philip Glass (The Hours, Naqoyqatsi, and Notes on a Scandal), Michael Nyman (Everyday), John Williams (Harry Potter film series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens) are some of the most notable. Apart from film composers and Judith Weir, mentioned above, other composers have embraced the growing technological advances of the 21st century. The work In Seven Days (2008), by Thomas Ad√®s, was composed for a piano, an orchestra, and six video screens. The video segments were created by Tal Rosner, Ad√®s's civil partner. Polaris for orchestra and five video screens was released in 2011. In 2008, Tan Dun (best known for the score for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) was commissioned by Google to compose Internet Symphony No. 1‚Äî\\"Eroica\\" to be performed collaboratively by the YouTube Symphony Orchestra. This work used the internet to recruit orchestra members and the final result was compiled into a mashup video, which premiered worldwide on YouTube. Ludovico Einaudi is one other notable composer still working in the 21st century, blending classical, folk, pop, rock and world musics. Polystylism and musical eclecticism are therefore important. He came to prominence in 1996 with his piano album Le Onde and is still very popular in Britain and Italy. His latest work is Elements, for piano, electronics and orchestra (2014), and he has written the film music for This Is England (2006) and its sequels (2010, 2011, and 2015), the trailer music for Black Swan (2010), and the classical album Una Mattina (2004). His album, In a Time Lapse, was released on 21 January 2013, with US and Canadian supporting tours.  Composers  Important composers include Eric Whitacre, Kaija Saariaho, Fazƒ±l Say, Jennifer Higdon, Magnus Lindberg, Michael Finnissy, Michel van der Aa, Nico Muhly, and Paulo Costa Lima.  Female composers  Roxanna Panufnik, in the aforementioned interview with the BBC, says: Important female composers working in the 21st century (not already mentioned in this article) include Chaya Czernowin, Unsuk Chin, Gabriela Lena Frank, Cevanne Horrocks- Hopayian, Sophie Lacaze, Liza Lim, Meredith Monk, Onutƒó Narbutaitƒó, Olga Neuwirth, Doina Rotaru, Rebecca Saunders, Linda Catlin Smith, Joan Tower and Agata Zubel .  Important composers who have died  Several important composers active in the 20th century have died in the early part of the 21st century. These include: Konrad Boehmer, Pierre Boulez, Elliott Carter, Dutilleux, Maxwell Davies, Rautavaara, Stockhausen, and Tavener (already mentioned); Maryanne Amacher, an installation artist and experimental composer; Milton Babbitt whose final works included songs, chamber music and Concerti for Orchestra (2004); Hans Werner Henze whose opera L'Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe was premi√®red in 2003 followed by Sebastian im Traum (2004) for large orchestra and the opera Phaedr (2007); Peter Lieberson whose Shing Kham for percussion and orchestra (2010‚Äì11) was finished by Oliver Knussen and Dejan Badnjar after his death; John McCabe whose final works include the seventh symphony (Labyrinth) and chamber music; Emmanuel Nunes whose La Main noire for 3 violas (2006‚Äì2007) was based on his opera Das M√§rchen; and Peter Sculthorpe whose Thoughts from Home for piano was intended to form part of the Gallipoli Symphony for Anzac Day (2015).  Other important composers active in the 21st century  Those still active (and not already mentioned) include: : Georges Aperghis : Gerald Barry : Robert Beaser : Michael Berkeley : Boudewijn Buckinx : Richard Danielpour : Michel Decoust : Andy DiGelsomina : Jo√´l-Fran√ßois Durand : Julio Estrada : Frans Geysen : Alexander Goehr : Heinz Holliger : Toshio Hosokawa : Caio Fac√≥ : Andr√© Laporte : Mario Lavista : Paulo Costa Lima : Magnus Lindberg : Scott Perkins : Matthias Pintscher : Michael Pisaro : Robert H.P.

In the latter half of the century, this started to change as composers again started to embrace a wider public. In the 21st century, there are a number of musicians and groups whose primary purpose is the promotion of new music : * Pierre- Laurent Aimard, French pianist * Alarm Will Sound, 20-member chamber orchestra * Arditti Quartet, led by British violinist Irvine Arditti * Asko Sch√∂nberg, Dutch chamber orchestra based in Amsterdam *Bang on a Can, an organization founded by American composers Julia Wolfe, David Lang and Michael Gordo * Marco Blaauw, Dutch trumpet player * Boston Modern Orchestra Project, led by Gil Rose * Ensemble Musikfabrik, from Cologne * Ensemble Modern, an international ensemble based in Frankfurt * ensemble recherche, based in Freiburg * The Esoterics, a vocal ensemble based in Seattle, Washington * Judd Greenstein, an American composer and promoter of new music in New York * Michael Gielen, Austrian conductor * Peter Hannan, Canadian recorder player * Oliver Knussen, British conductor * Kronos Quartet, a string quartet with over 750 new works written for them * International Contemporary Ensemble, or ICE, an ensemble that has premiered over 500 new works * Claire Chase, American flautist, founder of ICE (International Contemporary Ensemble) * Nicholas Isherwood, American-born bass singer * Reinbert de Leeuw, Dutch conductor, pianist, and composer * Christian Lindberg, Swedish trombonist * London Sinfonietta, chamber orchestra * Paul M√©fano, French conductor and composer * Les Percussions de Strasbourg, French percussion ensemble * Ensemble 2e2m, French musical ensemble specializing in the interpretation of works of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. * Steven Schick, American percussionist * Peter Serkin, American pianist * Greg Anderson and Elizabeth Roe, pianists who regularly perform duets and works for two pianos *Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic *Michele Marelli, Italian clarinetist *Ludovic Morlot, French conductor *Esa-Pekka Salonen, Finnish conductor *Robert Spano, American conductor *Harry Sparnaay, Dutch bass clarinetist *Tambuco, Mexican percussion ensemble *Theatre of Voices, an international vocal ensemble based in Copenhagen *Frances-Marie Uitti, American-born Dutch cellist References Category:Contemporary classical music ","title":"21st-century classical music"},{"id":"24686348","text":"Porela vetusta, the ancient porela, is a moth of the family Lasiocampidae.

There are three subplots: the monster's egg that is ready to hatch, a scientist who wants to capture the beast, and a mysterious sunken Nazi bomber plane which the military is trying to cover up. A Scottish scientist, George Sanderson, finds help from an American sonic expert, Spencer Dean, to team up and hunt for the monster. Along the journey, Spencer falls in love with Kathleen Stuart, who is the daughter of the first person to claim to take a photo of the monster, Jack Stuart. As these events are happening, a rival scientist, Professor Pratt, and his team are searching for the monster as well. Professor Pratt and his team end up finding a sunken World War II German bomber before retrieving the monster's egg. Although Professor Pratt and his team receive the monster's egg, the monster ends up killing his assistants, and Professor Pratt manages to successfully take the egg into his van. As Spencer and Sanderson attempt to locate the monster, Kathleen gets kidnapped by Professor Pratt. Kathleen is held captive while the monster goes on a killing spree in attempts to get her egg back. The monster's efforts are not successful, the monster is blown up, but her eggs are left to survive.

Season summary The club's foundation captain, Kim Hak-Cheol, had left Daegu to join the newly formed Incheon United, which was making its K-League debut. Hong Soon-Hak, a midfielder who had played a number of games the previous season, was designated captain. While all of the imports from the previous season bar Indio were released following the conclusion of the club's first season, Nonato and Jefferson, both Brazilian strikers, transferred in. Another Brazilian, Santiago, a central defender, would arrive mid-season. Daegu improved in 2004 to 10th place in the league, which due to Incheon United's entry, now boasted 13 clubs. The K-League revised its playing structure following the prolonged 2003 season, and now required each club to play home and away matches in two stages (each club playing 12 matches in each stage) against the other participating clubs; the winners of each stage qualifying for a playoff phase along with the top two teams from the overall table. This meant that only 24 regular season games were played. In contrast to the previous season, Daegu had a reasonable offensive record, scoring 30 goals during the season, second only to eventual champion Suwon. Daegu's Brazilian import, Nonato, finished the season as the club's leading scorer (and the K-league's overall runner-up), with 13 goals from 23 appearances. However, the club's defensive record was the worst in the league. Furthermore, in the FA Cup, Daegu were knocked out in the round of 32 by National League side Hallelujah FC. In the Samsung Hauzen Cup, a new cup competition run as a league competition specifically for K-League clubs (thus excluding National League and lower tier clubs) during the K-League's mid-season break, Daegu finished 8th out of 13 teams. Nonato again featured prominently on the scorekeeper's chart, being runner-up in goals scored. Nonato would subsequently be loaned to FC Seoul for the 2005 season.

His paternal grandfather was Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, the Bishop of Derry. He was born at his father's London house, 6 St James's Square, on 20 August 1808. From 1817 to 1822, he lived abroad with his parents, chiefly in Paris, and was taught by a private tutor. He entered Eton College in 1822 and remained there until 1826. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, and after a residence of two years and a half, obtained a first class in the classical tripos and graduated B.A. in 1830. Career Having been ordained both deacon and priest in October 1832, Hervey was instituted in November to the small family living of Ickworth-cum-Chedburgh, Suffolk, with which he was associated until 1869. Chedburgh, being in 1844 separated from Ickworth and joined to Horningsheath or Horringer, he also became curate of Horringer until in 1856 he was instituted to the rectory which he held with Ickworth. He was active in clerical work, took a leading part in the organisation of educational institutions in Bury St. Edmunds, and seems to have been the first to propose a system of university extension.In a pamphlet entitled 'A Suggestion for supplying the Literary . . . Institutes . . . with Lecturers from the Universities' (1855). In 1862 he was appointed archdeacon of Sudbury. On the resignation of Lord Auckland, Bishop of Bath and Wells, in 1869, he was offered the bishopric on the recommendation of William Ewart Gladstone, and was consecrated on 21 December. He remained in the post until his death in 1894. He was a moderate evangelical. Works Hervey was a good linguist, and wrote some antiquarian papers. He was one of the committee of revisers of the Authorised Version of the Old Testament, which sat 1870-1884, and in 1885 received the honorary degree of D.D. from the university of Oxford in recognition of his services. He contributed largely to William Smith's Dictionary of the Bible and to the Speaker's Commentary. Besides sermons and lectures, charges and pamphlets, he was author of The Genealogies of our Lord (1853). Family Tomb in Wells Cathedral Hervey married Patience Singleton, daughter of John Singleton (born Fowke), of Hacely, Hampshire, and Mell, County Louth, on 30 July 1839. They had twelve children, of whom five sons and three daughters survived him. He died in Hackwood, near Basingstoke, the house of his son-in-law, C. Hoare, on 9 June 1894 in his eighty-sixth year and was buried in Wells. In the 1870s, one of Hervey's daughters trained the mute swans in the five sided moat at the Bishops Palace to ring bells, by pulling strings, to beg for food.

It was the first health promotion body in the world to be funded by a tax on tobacco. Better known as VicHealth, the organisation has a mandate to promote good health for all Victorians. With a focus on promoting good health and preventing chronic disease, it leads and advocates for excellence in health-promoting policies and programs.  History   Founding and early history (1987‚Äì1997)  In 1987, the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) was established with funding from government-collected tobacco taxes and mandated to promote health in the State of Victoria. In 1988, VicHealth moved to buy out tobacco company sponsorship of sport and the arts. As a result, Quit, Heart Health and other health promotion programs replaced tobacco sponsorships. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria (now the Cancer Council Victoria) received funding from VicHealth to run its SunSmart and Quit programs and VicHealth funded the first Victorian breast cancer screening program. In 1989, VicHealth funded significant research into Alzheimer's disease at the Mental Health Research Institute. In 1994, VicHealth held its first national conference to examine the pioneering developments of working with sport and art organisations to promote health. VicHealth also funded the research arm of the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, a program aimed to increase the capacity to intervene and prevent youth suicide. In 1995, VicHealth launched Healthy Families of the Future, a program to improve mental health and wellbeing within families. In 1996, VicHealth was recognised with the World Health Organization Medal for Excellence and the Active for Life program launched in schools to teach children about making exercise a healthy lifetime habit to prevent heart disease.  1998‚Äì2007  In 1998‚Äì1999, VicHealth launched the Koori Health Research and Community Development Unit and the Mental Health Promotion Plan for Victoria; focusing on social connection, freedom from discrimination and economic participation as major factors impacting on mental health. In 2000, The VicHealth Centre for Tobacco Control opened, focusing on legal, economic and social research to strengthen tobacco control initiatives. In 2001, smokefree dining in Victoria was introduced and the Together We Do Better campaign was launched; promoting mental health and wellbeing. In 2002‚Äì2003, VicHealth joined forces with education, adolescent and welfare organisations to highlight bullying behaviour as a significant mental health issue and launched Leading the Way; working with councils to create healthier communities, and provide a resource to better equip councils to identify and respond to the built, social, economic and environmental issues that affect health and wellbeing in communities. In 2006, VicHealth ran a 10,000 Steps Walking Challenge during the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, the largest of its kind to take place in Victoria. More than 1600 clubs participated in the Australian Drug Foundation‚Äôs Good Sports program, an initiative supported by VicHealth designed to change the booze culture that exists in many sporting clubs. VicHealth established a partnership with the AFL to advance violence prevention activity through sport. In 2007, VicHealth supported a State Government ban on the sale of alcopop tubes and created the Victorian Health Inequalities Network to encourage public dialogue about the development of coherent strategies to reduce inequalities.  2008‚Äìpresent  In 2008, VicHealth hosted the 2008 World Conference on the Promotion of Mental Health in Melbourne. The Streets Ahead program began; supporting and motivating people, especially children, to get active in their neighbourhoods. In 2009, VicHealth invested in the creation of Victoria Walks, which lead the move to create walking-friendly neighbourhoods. VicHealth announced an extra investment of $1.5 million to further reduce tobacco-related harms in Victoria, bringing the total VicHealth investment in tobacco control to $19 million over the next four years. In 2011, the ‚ÄòSee Beyond Race‚Äô, campaign launched; aimed at increasing awareness and acceptance of culture diversity in Greater Shepparton. VicHealth funded 30 State Sporting Associations over a number of years to increase sport participation by making clubs more welcoming places for all members of the community. The MOTION program launched, aimed at improving people‚Äôs health by giving them opportunities to get creative, active and involved in their local community through the arts. In 2012, VicHealth launched the Creating Healthy Workplaces program; which combines international evidence with pilot projects to identify best practices for addressing stress, gender equity, alcohol-related harm, race-based discrimination and prolonged sitting at work. VicHealth bolstered its investment for a second round of ‚ÄòArts About Us‚Äô performances and art installations until June 2015 to inspire communities to embrace cultural diversity. In 2013, VicHealth welcomed the full implementation of plain packaging of tobacco with enlarged graphic health warnings, a significant achievement to further drive down the smoking rates. VicHealth launched Name That Point and the TeamUp campaigns as well as releasing a suite of products and resources from the VicHealth Indicators Survey. With support from The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, VicHealth launched the Seed Challenge, bringing together individuals and groups to develop innovative, contemporary solutions to get more Victorians eating healthy food. VicHealth opened a second round of MOTION funding and continued to fund 30 State Sporting Associations to create safe, accessible, inclusive and equitable sporting environments to increase participation. In 2014, VicHealth supported a huge public dance event, I Could Have Danced All Night, as part of White Night; a celebration of Melbourne's music, art, theatre, sport, fashion, film, design and performance. VicHealth also supported over 200,000 members in 742 sports and active recreation clubs across Victoria as part of VicHealth's Active Club Grants. In recognition of many years of generating and sharing evidence-based knowledge with local and international partners, VicHealth was designated as a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Leadership in Health Promotion in September 2014. In 2014, VicHealth launched its Leading Thinkers initiative which brought experts who draw upon behavioural economics and other fields to generate new thinking and approaches to health challenges. In 2015, VicHealth convened Australia's largest Citizens' Jury. The VicHealth Citizens' Jury on Obesity saw more than 100 everyday people from Victoria come together online and face-to-face to answer the question 'How can we make it easier to eat better?'. They assessed evidence from submissions and presentations and formed their 'asks' which was reviewed by a steering committee of decision-makers in public health, government and industry. VicHealth is implementing actions in eight of the 20 asks. Strategic imperatives VicHealth's Action Agenda for Health Promotion 2013‚Äì2023 focuses on the following five strategic imperatives: * promoting healthy eating * encouraging regular physical activity * preventing tobacco use * preventing harm from alcohol * improving mental wellbeing These priorities are consistent with VicHealth‚Äôs obligations under the Tobacco Act of 1987. They also align with State Government policy and program directions, and national and international health promotion priorities and policies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) charters and declarations for Health Promotion. Organisation VicHealth has a Board of Governance that is responsible to the Victorian Minister for Health. The current CEO is Dr Sandro Demaio. His predecessors were Dr Lyn Roberts AO (Acting), Jerril Rechter, Todd Harper, now CEO of the Cancer Council Victoria; Rob Moodie, Professor of Global Health at the Nossal Institute of Global Health; University of Melbourne, and Rhonda Galbally, currently CEO of Australian community sector resource directory Our Community. Sir Gustav Nossal led VicHealth‚Äôs first Board, followed by Professor John Funder. VicHealth‚Äôs current Chair is Fiona McCormack.

TF-East provides the U.S. and its partners in Romania and Bulgaria with training facilities and, currently, a periodic integrated combined staff that stands up to facilitate combined training. Exercises at BS-AST (Former: TF-East) hone U.S. and host nation-invited NATO partner nations‚Äô ability to deploy forces and operate in austere conditions away from home stations. It enables training participants to learn from each other and improve their capabilities. Operations in Romania and Bulgaria also provide the U.S. and its partners the opportunity to engage in and demonstrate the continuance of peaceful and friendly international relations through combined training using host nation installations to support and facilitate rotational training activities. The facilities used include the Romanian Air Force's Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu Airfield (MKAF) located in the city of the same name and the Romanian Land Forces Babadag Training Area located approximately 70 km to the north. In Bulgaria, the primary facility is located in the Novo Selo Training Area located near Mokren, Bulgaria.Embassy of the United States, Sofia, Bulgaria These are sovereign host nation bases with co-located U.S. funded constructed facilities that the U.S. military uses on a consignment basis as stipulated in the Defense Cooperation Agreement signed by the governments involved. The U.S. military units training at the facilities are guests; they remain under a clear U.S. chain of command. BS-AST (former: TF-E) involves a bilateral, long-term investment in both Romania and Bulgaria that strives to have a positive impact in the local areas by providing jobs for the local populace through service and support contracts in support of the operations; providing construction and medical humanitarian civil assistance projects in the local areas; and having a positive impact on the local economy by the presence of U.S. and other host nation-invited NATO forces. History Origin While discussing initiatives directing the transformation of the U.S. military, Marine Gen. James L. Jones, Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, testified before Congress in April 2003 of the need for the European Command to \\"shift west\\" (back to the continental U.S.), \\"shift south\\" (Africa), and \\"shift east\\" to forward operating bases with our new NATO partners. The Eastern European Task Force (EETAF) concept envisioned a joint capable, deployable command and control headquarters that would not have permanently assigned combat forces, but which would command rotational forces operating out of sites in Romania (up to 1700 personnel) and Bulgaria (up to 2500 personnel). The EETAF HQ would be primarily responsible for supporting security cooperation activities throughout Eastern Europe. The Army component of EETAF would be a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) rotating on a four to six-month basis from the continental U.S. or Europe. The March 2006 Strategic Planning Guidance modified the presence requirement from a full-time BCT to a ‚Äúperiodic rotational force.‚Äù U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Romania in 2005 and Bulgaria in 2006 dictating the stipulations of the two bi-lateral agreements. The EETAF concept described a two-phased process to ‚Äústart small and grow‚Äù the objective capability. Phase I, from November 2004 to June 2007, involved USAREUR securing the necessary host nation agreements and constructing the facilities. Phase II would begin with the first ‚ÄúProof of Principle‚Äù battalion-sized rotation in June 2007 and eventually followed by a full brigade combat team as the facilities, training areas and agreements were established and validated. The 2007 Phase I ‚ÄúProof of Principle‚Äù and the 2008 Rotation were successful in validating the EETAF concept and provided key insights for further development. Key construction tasks identified for accomplishment in Phase I were not completed and insights were gained indicating significant improvement and expansion of facilities and training areas was required to meet the original brigade-sized concept; but, the plans had been developed, a timeline established, and funding allocated to complete construction of the identified Permanent Forward Operating Site (PFOS) in Romania and, later, one in Bulgaria. Facilities In Romania prior to the first rotation in 2007, existing Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu Airfield facilities were improved and temporary (prefabricated) facilities constructed to provide offices, billets, storage facilities, recreation and other life support needs to the JTF-East staff and rotational units. Most of these same temporary facilities, in addition to some remodeled structures, are what JTF-E used at MKAF through the 2009 rotation. In 2007, construction commenced in the former Romanian 34th Mechanized Brigade area in Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu for a \\"permanent forward operating site‚Äù to provide necessary life and training support facilities on a more permanent basis for up to 1,600 troops. This $47.4 million facility is expected to be completed and fully operational before the 2010 rotation. In the Romanian Land Forces Babadag Training Area, temporary facilities were constructed for the 2009 rotation that would accommodate up to 1,100. Similar facilities in Novo Selo Training Area, Bulgaria were also constructed to support the 2009 staff and rotational units there. - Both of these facilities were for joint and coalition use. The new US-funded facilities in both Bulgaria and Romania include barracks, battalion and brigade headquarters, chapel, dining facility, community center, fire and military police stations, first-aid station, retail or department store, post office, movie theater, fitness center, maintenance shops, showers and restrooms, and other support buildings for training and storage. In Bulgaria construction on a similar PFOS in the Novo Selo Training Area in Mokren, Bulgaria commenced construction in the winter of 2009 and is expected to be completed in 2012. The $54 million U.S.-funded facility is designed for 2,500 troops, providing 77 fully functional, turn-key type facilities with associated roads and infrastructure. After Proof of Principle Romanian and US forces train together The original 2007 Proof of Principle was originally planned to be conducted by a battalion-sized element from the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (2SCR) that had deployed to Germany in 2006. Following the Proof of Principle, the construction and rotations would continue until the brigade combat team headquarters could be established by January 2008, followed by a full-up BCT-sized rotation in summer 2008. However, in May 2007, the Pentagon announced that the 2SCR would be participating in the surge of U.S. forces to Iraq. USAREUR replaced 2SCR's participation in the Proof of Principle with 1-94th Field Artillery battalion, a unit well-prepared to conduct the type of training envisioned to help prepare the Romanian and Bulgarian units scheduled to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. Approximately 350 U.S. and 100 Romanian troops participated in the Proof of Principle. After the Proof of Principle exercise was completed, U.S. Army Europe issued an order for JTF-East to begin a period of ‚Äúwarm- basing‚Äù at the Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu Airfield, Romania. The driver for this decision was the absence of any available rotational forces to occupy JTF-East due to the 2007 ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in Iraq, which significantly increased the number of troops deployed there. This decision to go to a warm-basing status was reinforced by the perception that the impact on rotational force availability would be temporary and that construction of the PFOS was not yet complete. As operational impacts grew clearer, in February 2008, USAREUR announced that the originally intended brigade-sized rotation would be downsized to a battalion for 2008. Due to the lack of forces available in Europe, the rotation was adjusted to a battalion-sized active component/reserve component mix. The 2008 Rotation was executed sequentially with training operations first in Romania then in Bulgaria. Approximately 3,100 total U.S., Romanian, and Bulgarian personnel participated in the first rotation. Of the 2,100 that participated in Romania, the U.S. units included the 1-200 Infantry of the New Mexico Army National Guard, the 541st Engineer Company and B Company, 1-4th Infantry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 94th Field Artillery from Germany; Romanian Land Forces included the 341st Infantry Battalion.Association of the United States Army Nearly 1,000 participants in Bulgaria included members of the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery out of Germany. Concept of Warm- Basing US and Bulgarian troops renovate a kindergarten USAREUR directed the execution of \\"warm-basing\\" at JTF-East in November 2007 to maintain the facilities and facilitate various training missions and on-going humanitarian civil assistance (HCA) missions. The site at Novo Selo Training Area in Bulgaria was closed completely, while the area of the Temporary Forward Operating Site and PFOS construction at MKAF, Romania became the focal point of JTF-East efforts. The plan directed that USAREUR designate a lieutenant colonel as the warm-basing commander. The first commander was Lt. Col. John Moon for 2007-08 and second was Lt. Col. Tina Kracke for the winter of 2008-2009. The plan also directed a colonel be assigned as the commander to assume ‚Äúfull command authority‚Äù over all U.S. personnel operating on or from MKAF and the Novo Selo Training Area during rotations. The first colonel designee was Col. Peri A. Anest. The staff was assigned as necessary to accomplish the mission. On occasion USAREUR staff sections would surge additional personnel to JTF-East when required for a specific task or during a rotation. During the 2009 rotation, the name \\"Joint Task Force-East\\" was formally changed to \\"Task Force-East\\" to more accurately depict the fact that the task force is led by a single U.S. military service component. Currently (2008‚Äì2010) during the warm-basing period, the facility at Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu Airfield supports a contingency of about 20 to 30 U.S. support personnel including U.S. Soldiers, U.S. government civilian employees, local national contract employees, and US Army Corps of Engineers employees who manage the construction of the PFOS. Most personnel are assigned for about a one to two- year tour of duty. In addition, since the summer of 2007, U.S. Navy Seabees detachments of 25 to 30 construction-men and women have been stationed in MKAF. They have been on six-month tours conducting HCA projects in the areas TF-East operates in both Romania and Bulgaria. Currently (2010), there is no significant personnel presence in Bulgaria during the off-season. The TF-East headquarters in Romania manages both operations except during the rotational exercises when a JTF-East ‚ÄúForward‚Äù headquarters is stood up. The Bulgarian TF-East Forward headquarters is under the command and control of the TF-East commander based out of Romania. Training Training conducted at TF-East starts at the individual level and continues up to company-level in both Romania and Bulgaria. U.S. troops along with their host nation counterparts conduct both situational training exercises and live-fire exercises. In addition, staff elements are integrated at varying degrees for the duration of the operation to foster interoperability and working relationships. Romanians and Americans train together Integrated training includes conducting individual and crew-served weapons qualification, mounted and dismounted situational training, live-fire training, mounted patrolling, combat lifesaver training, and familiarization and training on the use of non-lethal weapon systems. Training equipment and vehicles have included High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV or Humvee), the Romanian's VAMTAC (Veh√≠culo de Alta Movilidad T√°ctico; a Spanish-made 4-wheel drive military vehicle), variants of the U.S. Stryker Light Armored Vehicle, the Romanian and Bulgarian armored personnel carriers in addition to various logistical support vehicles and equipment to include the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. In addition, JTF-East provides training tools to include the Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000) and the HMMWV Egress Assistance Trainer (HEAT). Headquarters The rotational TF-E headquarters have been a combined staff of U.S.-Romanian (in Romania) and U.S.-Bulgarian (in Bulgaria) forces. Troops from the Romanian and Bulgarian Land Forces and U.S. Soldiers and civilians from throughout U.S. Army Europe filled the bulk of the manning requirements. U.S. Army Reserve individual augmentees as well as a few service members from other U.S. service components and the National Guard have rounded-out various positions as well. Several local national contracted employees also fill a number of the positions both during the rotational period and year-round. Joint Task Force-East/Task Force-East 2009 US military medics provide medical assistance in Bulgaria. Commanded by Col. Gary R. Russ, the 2009 TF-East rotation in both Romania and Bulgaria included, for the first time, inclusion of approximately 30 Stryker combat vehicles in each country along with about the same number of Romanian and Bulgarian armored personnel carriers. The 2009 rotation was the first rotation with concurrent training for the duration of the rotation in both countries from the first week of August to the end of October. In Romania, the rotation included approximately 1,600 personnel including U.S., Romanian military and civilian support and the rotational units. Approximately 180 soldiers were from the Tennessee Army National Guard‚Äôs 176th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion headquartered in Johnson City, Tenn.; nearly 450 soldiers were from the 4th Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment from Vilseck, Germany. Romanian personnel numbered about 600 with service members from the 1st Infantry Division to include the 33rd Mountain Troop Battalion, Posada. U.S. units training in Bulgaria included over 1,400 personnel including soldiers from the Tennessee Army National Guard's 1-181st Field Artillery Battalion out of Chattanooga, Tenn.; 2nd Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, from Vilseck, Germany, and the Tennessee Army National Guard's 117th Military Police Battalion. Over 500 Bulgarian Land Forces participated including the 4th Artillery Regiment of Asenovgrad; 68th Special Forces Brigade from Plovdiv; 61st Mechanized Brigade of Karlovo; 5th Mechanized Brigade of Pleven; and Center for Preparation of Tank Specialists out of Sliven.Ministry of Defense Other rotational activities included humanitarian civic assistance construction missions conducted by U.S. Navy Seabees in partnership with Romanian and Bulgarian Land Force engineers. With an average cost of approximately $15,000 in materials per project over the last two years, the U.S. Department of Defense-funded program executed locally by TF-East included renovations of public facilities to include kindergartens, community centers, medical facilities and school fences. During the 2009 rotation, approximately $185,000 in HCA funds were spent supporting five projects in Bulgaria and four in Romania. Since 2007, about 38 projects have been completed in the communities around the TF-East operational areas in Bulgaria and Romania. The HCA missions are intended to help the local communities, build positive relations, and help set conditions for the success of TF-East. TF-East also executed medical HCA missions during 2009 rotation helping approximately 3,700 local people in 17 different communities in and around the JTF-East operational area in both Bulgaria (9 villages) and Romania (8 villages). In partnership with Romanian and Bulgarian military and community medical professionals, an 11-member U.S. medical team provided medical and dental screenings, public health education and optometry screenings to include distributing nearly 3,400 eyeglasses to people who couldn't otherwise afford them. In addition, TF-East acquired and distributed $18,000 of locally purchased U.S. HCA program-funded pharmaceuticals for dispensing to locals free of charge by the community medical professionals in Romania. The drugs were specifically purchased to target the main health issues identified by the HCA medical team during the screenings. Future The year 2009 marked the third rotation of JTF-E/TF-East and it continues to be one of the USAREUR commander's strategic priorities playing a key role in EUCOM's theater security cooperation program. Romania and Bulgaria are strong and important allies of the U.S. and have provided consistent support to U.S. overseas contingency operations; both of these countries currently have forces fighting alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Training together hones and develops techniques, tactics, and procedures that assist tactical units in working together in combat. Additionally, building interoperability, professional and personal relationships are essential for the success of today and tomorrow's coalitions and TF-East is a unique tool to help accomplish that. Planners continue to work the details to expand the success TF-East has had over the past three years. With the anticipated completion of the facility in Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, Romania in 2010 and the facility in Novo Selo Training Area, Bulgaria in 2012, even more opportunities for combined training will emerge allowing the already strong U.S.-RO and U.S.-BU relationships to grow even further. In 2010 it changed to Black Sea Area Support Team. The mission of the Black Sea Area Support Team is to provide base operations support to U.S. Forces in the Black Sea theater of operations. This includes, but is not limited to, providing life support, logistics support, base camp operations, reception, staging, fiscal management and budgetary activities, and coordination of force protection of U.S. military and government civilians in the area of responsibility.

It lies in East Anglia about north of London. Its main transport links are the M11 road to London, the A14 east‚Äìwest road and the West Anglia Main Line railway line to London. Buses Cambridge has several bus services including routes linking five Park and Ride sites all of which operate seven days a week and are aimed at encouraging motorists to park near the city's edge. Cambridge park-and-ride Since 7 August 2011, the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway has bus services running into the centre of Cambridge. Most buses run to and from the bus station located on Drummer Street in the heart of the city, although there are significant interchanges at the railway station and at Addenbrooke's Hospital. The principal operator is Stagecoach. The Busway A guided bus entering the concrete busway track Cambridgeshire Guided Busway is the world's longest guided busway and passes through Cambridge. Secretary of State Celebrates Start of Works on Guided Busway The designated route runs on normal road from Huntingdon to St Ives, then via a bus-only guided section along a former railway line south- westwards into Cambridge, where it rejoins the road at either Milton Road or Histon Road and then continues to Cambridge railway station on normal roads. From there it is again guided to Addenbrooke's Hospital and Trumpington Park and Ride. Cambridgeshire Guided Busway An additional short spur, to Cambridge North railway station, opened in 2017. The scheme, budgeted at ¬£116.2 million, had been scheduled to open in early 2009 Guided Busway leaflet but did not open until in August 2011. The scheme had been heavily criticised by campaigners who believed that the route would be better served by restoring the existing railway route. Cambridge Park & Ride A Stagecoach in Cambridge Park & Ride Enviro 400 The city is served by a seven days a week park and ride service run by Cambridgeshire County Council and Stagecoach. Five sites on the outskirts of the city or just outside its boundaries ‚Äì at Babraham Road, Madingley Road, Milton, Newmarket Road and Trumpington ‚Äì provide over 4,500 parking spaces, electric car charging and other facilities. Buses run from these sites into the city centre up to every 7 minutes. Roads Because of its rapid growth in the 20th century, Cambridge has a congested road network. Several major roads intersect at Cambridge. The M11 motorway from east London terminates to the north-west of the city where it joins the A14. Skirting the northern edge Cambridge, the A14 is a major freight route which connects the port of Felixstowe on the east coast with the Midlands, North Wales, the west coast and Ireland. The A14 is often congested, particularly the section between Huntingdon and Cambridge where the east‚Äìwest traffic is merged with the A1 to M11 north‚Äìsouth traffic on a 2-lane dual carriageway. Cambridge is situated on the A10, a former Roman road from north London to Ely and King's Lynn. The A428 connects the city with Bedford and St Neots, and the A1303 to Newmarket and beyond to Colchester. Some roads around the city have been designated as forming a ring road about a mile and a half in diameter, inside which there are traffic restrictions. There are five council car parks in the city centre. There are limited numbers of metered bays offering parking for up to 1‚Äì8 hours across the city Cycling Some colleges and workplaces have large bicycle parks. As a university town lying on fairly flat ground and with traffic congestion, Cambridge has a large number of cyclists. Many residents also prefer cycling to driving in the narrow, busy streets, giving the city the highest level of cycle use in the UK.http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/SearchRes.asp?term=KS15&btnSubmit;=Search UK Census 2001 According to the 2001 census, 25% of residents travelled to work by bicycle. A few roads within the city are adapted for cycling, including separate traffic lights for cycle lanes and cycle contraflows on streets which are otherwise one-way; the city also benefits from parks which have shared use paths. There are, however, no separate cycle paths within the city centre. Despite the high levels of cycling, expenditure on cycling infrastructure is around the national average of 0.3% of the transport budget. There are a few cycle routes in the surrounding countryside and the city is now linked to the National Cycle Network. The main organisation campaigning to improve conditions for cyclists in Cambridge is the Cambridge Cycling Campaign.Cambridge Cycling Campaign The city was chosen as a Cycling Town by the Department for Transport in 2008, with central government funding an expansion of cycling facilities in the city and its surrounding villages. There was a 5% increase in cycling from 2013 to 2014 ‚Äì an increase of 88% since 2004. Bike theft in the city is a problem, with over 3000 bicycles reported stolen between April 2005 and March 2006. The actual number is believed to be higher as many thefts are not reported to the police. Rail The front of station Cambridge currently has two railway stations. Cambridge railway station was built in 1845 with a platform designed to take two full- length trains, the third longest in the country. Cambridge North railway station is located in the suburb of Chesterton, close to Cambridge Science Park and opened in May 2017. Both stations are run by Greater Anglia. Cambridge has direct rail links to London with termini at (on the Hitchin- Cambridge Line and the East Coast Main Line) and (on the West Anglia Main Line). There is a direct shuttle service to King's Cross every half-hour during off peak hours. Peak hour trains to King's Cross have additional stops. Future developments for the Cambridge to London line include the provision of high speed trains. The line is currently graded for . The line is all welded rail, but because of the flat geography there are many level crossings, and they make it harder to run at higher speeds. Aside from London, Cambridge is linked by rail to and (via the Fen Line), (via the Breckland Line), , Birmingham New Street, and Stansted Airport. The important UK rail hub of is also less than an hour from Cambridge, which provides direct connections to Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh Waverley. A British Rail Class 37 at Cambridge on the diamond crossing under British Rail. , adjacent to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, is planned to open in 2025.  Proposed developments   East West Rail  The railway service connecting Cambridge and Oxford, known as the Varsity Line, ceased in 1968. The East West Rail proposal plans to reinstate a direct rail route to Oxford, possibly by 2030.Transport Secretary officially launches East West Railway Company at Bletchley Park East West Rail, 22 November 2017 Air The nearest passenger services are from London Stansted Airport at and London Luton Airport at , Birmingham Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Heathrow Airport all being about 90 minutes' travel, and the smaller London City Airport approximately 75 minutes' travel. The city's own airport is Cambridge Airport (formerly Marshall Airport Cambridge UK and originally Teversham Aerodrome) and is owned by Marshall Aerospace. There are no scheduled passenger services, though the runway can accommodate an unladen Boeing 747 or MD-11 and ScotAirways used to make scheduled flights to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.

Current Developments  Cambridge Cycling Town  In 2008 Cambridge was awarded the status of \\"Cycling Town\\", and granted ¬£3.6 million to spend on cycling improvements. Cambridgeshire County Council currently plans to use the money to construct six new cycle paths in the city and its surrounding area: *Cottenham to Histon *Histon to Cambridge *Harston to Cambridge *Babraham Road Park & Ride to Wandlebury *Fen Ditton to Horningsea *Milton to Impington Cambridge Gateway In order to promote safety and improve access to Cambridge railway station, the County Council is redeveloping the area surrounding it. Work is set to commence by the end of 2010 and continue for about a year, Local Transport Today, Issue 557, page 0 at an estimated cost of ¬£3.1 million. The redevelopment of the Cambridge Station area has been given the green light and has been awarded ¬£1.5 million of central government money to help pay for the scheme.

In 2009 the County Council revealed its plans to spend ¬£25 million on renovating the area from Regent Street to the Cherry Hinton Road Junction, entitled Project Cambridge. The scheme is composed of many smaller projects with common themes of making junctions easier for pedestrians to cross, promoting cycle use and reducing traffic. The scheme, criticised for not having had consultation with councillors or the public, is to be funded through tax increment financing where the money would initially be borrowed and would be repaid over 25 years from increases in business tax revenue. The scheme was due to be discussed by councilors in October 2009. The mayor of the newly-created Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, James Palmer, made the introduction of a light rail scheme, partly running underground, a priority on his election in 2017.  The Holford-Wright Report  In 1950, a city plan for Cambridge was published. Chaired by Sir William Holford, an eminent architect and planner, it proposed a set of changes which a relief road for the centre of Cambridge, which would have destroyed terraced housing and other areas.

When heated with hydrochloric acid, tannins in cocoa solids yield a glucose and a phlobaphene.Warden C. J. H., Pharm. Jour., [3], xviii. 985 Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to small additions during sole leather tannage carried out in hot liquors (temperature above 35 ¬∞C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulfiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Phlobaphenes formation (tannins condensation and precipitation) can be minimized in using strong nucleophiles, such as phloroglucinol, m-phenylenediamine and urea, during pine tannins extraction. The use of synthetic tannin neradol D can help solubilize phlobaphen in tanning solutions.

These lactotripeptides are derived from casein, which is a milk protein also found in dairy products. Although most normal dairy products contain lactotripeptides, they are inactive within the original milk proteins. Dairy peptides can be effectively released through enzymatic predigestion - a process by which milk protein is enzymatically broken down into smaller pieces. Some clinical studies have suggested that these lactotripeptides help promote healthy blood pressure levels as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle.Hirata H, Nakamura Y, Yada H, Moriguchi S, Kajimoto O, Takahashi T. Clinical Effects of New Sour Milk Drink in Mild or Moderate Hypertensive Subjects .J New Rem & Clin 2002;51:61-9. However, other clinical trials have seen no effects from these compounds.  Proposed mechanism  Dairy peptides are proposed to inhibit the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is part of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system - a natural mechanism that helps regulate blood pressure in the body. In certain individuals, the renin‚Äìangiotensin system can become overactive, often due to stress, an unhealthy diet, and/or unhealthy lifestyle. Under such conditions, ACE becomes overactive and converts more angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, and so increases blood pressure, which has potential to lead to hypertension. But, when ACE activity is inhibited, the formation of angiotensin II is reduced. This then helps the blood vessels to relax and expand back to a normal healthy state, so blood pressure is lowered.  Clinical trials  Several human trials aimed to evaluate the effect of lactotripeptides on blood pressure. Some trials show a blood pressure-lowering effect of lactotripeptides in people with mild to moderate hypertension, however others see no effect from these peptides. A recent systematic review of the literature found no confirmed ACE-inhibitor effects in humans, as well as no conclusive evidence for lactotripeptides as a successful intervention; the meta-analysis cited heterogeneity in methodology and lack of inclusion of recent larger studies by prior meta-analyses to account for the variance between studies.

According to Baylis postcolonial international relations scholarship has been largely ignored by mainstream international relations theorists and has only recently begun to make an impact on the discipline. Postcolonialism focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.Baylis, Smith and Owens, The Globalisation of World Politics, OUP, 4th ed, p187-189 Postcolonial IR challenges the eurocentrism of IR‚Äîparticularly its parochial assumption that Western Enlightenment thinking is superior, progressive and universally applicable. Postcolonialists argue that this is enabled through constructing the Other as irrational and backwards.Edward Said (1979), Orientalism, New York: Vintage Books Postcolonial IR attempts to expose such parochial assumptions of IR; for example, in the construction of white versus coloured peoples. An example is the IR story of a \\"white men's burden\\" to educate and liberate coloured men and women, to protect coloured women from coloured men. Often this is linked to other postpositivist theories, for example, through Postcolonial feminism, which analyze issues in IR through the lenses of gender and culture. Examples of the parochialistic nature of IR include geographical parochialism and cultural chauvinism. For the former, the construction of the Cold War era as a time of peace ignores the reality that major conflicts continued in the developing world. Furthermore, the oft-cited history of IR is constructed in western terms (more information under history); and IR has been used to justify everything from imperialism to a playground for skirmishes between the two Cold War superpowers. For the latter, the West (through IGOs such as the IMF's quick rush to \\"save\\" Asia in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997‚Äì8) could be seen as both a white men's burden to save Asia or to reformulate Asian capitalism in a Western image.Cultural Chauvinism and the Liberal International Order - ‚ÄòWest vs Rest‚Äô in Asia‚Äôs Financial Crisis - Forthcoming in G. Chowdhry and S. Nair (eds), Power in a Postcolonial World: Race, Gender and Class in International Relations (London: Routledge) http://www.isanet.org/archive/ling2.html  Criticisms and defense  Such IR stories are purposefully limited in scope in terms of statecentric modelling, cataloguing and predicting in formal terms; and like other postpositivist theories, they do not attempt to form an overarching theory as after all, postpositivism is defined as incredulity towards metanarratives. This is replaced by a sensitivity and openness to the unintended consequences of metanarratives and their negative impacts on the most marginalised actors in IR. In defence, postpositivists argue that metanarratives have proven unworkable. Thus, such theories, although limited in scope, provide for much greater possibilities in the normative work of developing an emancipatory politics, formulating foreign policy, understanding conflict, and making peace, which takes into account gender, ethnicity, other identity issues, culture, methodology and other common issues that have emerged from problem- solving, rationalist, reductive accounts IR.

The church belongs to the Syrian Orthodox Church which stands on a hill about 30 km from Ernakulam on the Moovattupuzha road. The history of this church was not written down, but lives through legends. The stories about Kadamattathu Kathanar embody the exaggerated experience of the people in that area giving expression through magic and sorcery. The stories relating to him tells that he had supernatural powers and being a Christian priest used his magic for the common good. In medieval legends, history and fables were combined inextricably. The story of Kadamattathu Kathanar might be a mixture of history and fables. Currently there is no certain proof that he really existed, but the fact that a real priest lived in that area in the ninth century cannot be denied. Tradition points out the existence of Christians in the area from 5th century of the Christian Era.Kottoor_kulangattil Family Magazine 2012 (Kottoor Church History) Mar Sabor and Mar Proth StoryKottarathil Sankunni. EithihyamaalaIythiha Maala (legends of Kerala). Chapter 72. pp 380-391. Childhood Poulose was born in a very poor Syrian Christian family in Kadamattom, a small village in North Travancore (now part of Kerala). People fondly called him Kochu Poulose. He had no siblings and his parents died when he was a child. He was taken care of by his mother for a short period before her death after which he came under the patronage of the Persian priest Mar Abo. Living in a small cottage with no one to look after, he felt depressed, left his home and went to a nearby church. The parish priest who passed that way saw this boy crying and praying on the doorsteps of his church. He took him to his house gave him shelter and food and cared for him like his own child. Soon the parish priest had realized that this boy was religious, intelligent and efficient. So he was given a good education under a famous teacher. The priest himself took time to teach him Syriac and Liturgy of the Mass. In due course he was ordained as a Deacon and people began to call him Deacon Poulose. Mastering of Magical Powers According to a popular legend, a local priest had a herd of cattle which were taken out by a servant boy to the nearby hills for grazing. One day while he was out with the cattle on the hills, a tiger came and killed one of them. Afraid of the tiger the boy ran to the village and told the priest what had happened. The priest and Deacon Poulose, immediately summoned the people in the village and they went out in different directions searching for the cattle. By sunset all the cattle returned, except the one that was killed by the tiger. But soon the priest realized that Deacon Poulose, who went in search of the cattle, did not return. Search parties went out in different directions that night. But there was no sign of the deacon. Days passed by, still he had not returned. Though the villagers thought that he was killed by the tiger, the priest believed that he was still alive somewhere. Paulose had actually lost his way in the deep forest which eventually led him to a group of ancient tribals. It is believed that he mastered his magical powers from these cannibal tribes known as Mala Arayas living in subterranean abodes. Their leader who became fond of Paulose, allowed him to stay with them for many years during which he learned the secrets of magical performances. Paulose later escaped from there after which the Mala Arayas searched for him in vain. It is believed that Kathanar escaped by staying in the church when the cannibal tribes created a storm in their effort to destroy the church and capture him. The scars said to be generated by the storm are still visible on the walls of the church. Mar Sabor the Bishop who ordained him as a priest left from Kadamattom after the arrival of Paulose. The Bishop built many churches, Kayamkulam and finally settled at Thevalakkara, his tomb inside the Martha Mariam Church Thevalakkara. It is difficult to detail all the great deeds in the life of Kadamattathu Kathanar as not many verifiable records exist. He has written a number of books on sorcery but his writings are not legible and is incomprehensive to the lay reader. Last days Neither his date of birth nor date of death are known. Till the end of his life, he did not reveal from where or from whom he received lessons on sorcery. It is believed that he went into a cave and disappeared. The cave, which is located beside the church is still preserved.

The principal source for his life are his own Memoirs,John Adolphus, Memoirs of John Bannister, Comedian, 2 vols (Richard Bentley, London 1839). Volume 1 Read here Volume 2 Read here and as a leading performer his career is well documented. Biography John Bannister was born at Deptford. He was the son of Charles Bannister, also an actor. He first studied to be a painter, but soon took to the stage. His first formal appearance was at the Haymarket Theatre in 1778 as Dick in Arthur Murphy's farce The Apprentice.In the Memoirs, Vol. 1, pp. 10-12, John Adolphus is careful to point out that a certain actor named J. Bannister active between 1764 and 1774 'was a very different person from the son of Charles,' though occasionally confused with him. The same year at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane he played in James Miller's version of Voltaire's Mahomet the part of Zaphna, which he had studied under David Garrick. The Palmira of the cast was Mrs Robinson (\\"Perdita\\"). His reputation increased with his personification of Don Whiskerando in The Critic in 1779, and he was well known in the character of Joseph Surface in The School for Scandal.H. van Thal (ed), Solo Recital: The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly, abridged with a Biographical Index (Folio Society, London 1972), p. 330. Bannister married Elizabeth Harper on 26 January 1783 who was a skilled actor and singer. Bannister was concerned about the rise of John Philip Kemble and his wife taught him to sing to help him compete. They had four daughters and his wife retired in 1792 to concentrate on their family. Bannister was the best low comedian of his day. He was in the first presentation of the comic burletta Hero and Leander by Isaac Jackman, as Solano, opposite John Braham as Hymen, with which John Palmer's Royalty Theatre in Goodman's Fields embarked in 1787 upon comedy theatre having been prevented by statute from presenting serious drama.The British Drama: A Collection of the Most Esteemed Tragedies, Comedies, Operas, and Farces, in the English Language. In Two Volumes, (Jones & Co., London 1824), Vol. 1, p. 213. He appeared as Juan in Stephen Storace's first musical success at Drury Lane in the same year, in James Cobb's adaptation of Dittersdorf's The Doctor and the Apothecary.The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 462. He led the cast in 1788 as the whimsical Sir David Dunder in George Colman the Younger's Ways and Means.The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 92. Bannister is mentioned several times in the Memoirs of his friend Michael Kelly. He was in the first production of Stephen Storace's The Pirates (text by James Cobb), with Kelly, Charles Dignum, Mrs Crouch and Mme Storace, under Sheridan's direction, at the King's Theatre on 20 November 1792.Michael Kelly (with Theodore Hook), Memoirs, ed. and abridged by H. Van Thal, Solo Recital: The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly (Folio Society, London 1972), p. 191. In 1797, Richard Cumberland wrote and staged (on 8 May 1797, at Drury Lane) his comedy The Last of the Family as a benefit for Bannister. It was repeated four times. Cumberland had been offended by the ridicule heaped on him in The Critic, and much disliked Sheridan. Before the production, Kelly and Bannister were invited to Tunbridge Wells to hear the play read over dinner. Kelly fell asleep during the reading. In revenge the pair were later treated to a reading of the first three acts of Cumberland's five-act tragedy Tiberius, and only avoided acts four and five by fleeing back to London.Kelly, Memoirs, pp. 216-221. In 1799 Bannister joined with Kelly to acquire the English copyright in a German work by Kotzebue (whose Pizarro had provided such an effective source for Sheridan), and induced Tom Dibdin to create a new libretto around the dramatic incidents, called Of Age Tomorrow, for which Kelly then provided the music. Bannister appeared in it (opposite Miss Decamp, the future Mrs Charles Kemble), in the character of the Hair Dresser, and he could not 'have handled the comb, curling irons and powder puff more skilfully'.Kelly, Memoirs, pp. 228-29. In November 1802 he was again with Kelly, Miss Decamp, Suett and Wewitzer in James Cobb's A House to be Sold. As manager of Drury Lane (1802-1815) Bannister was no less successful. In February 1809 he was one of the group including Michael Kelly, Richard Sheridan and William Dowton who met with Richard Wroughton (stage-manager) on the day after the fire which destroyed the theatre, and under Sheridan's exhortation agreed to keep the company together so far as possible during their subsequent removal to the Lyceum in the Strand.Kelly, Memoirs, pp. 283-85. In the 1814 revival of George Farquhar's The Inconstant, 'The inimitable performance of Bisarre, by Mrs Jordan, and of Duretete, by Mr John Bannister, will long be remembered with delight.'The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 170. The same year saw him as Scrub in the same author's The Beaux's Stratagem (originally 1707),The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 791. and as Colonel Feignwell (with Dowton as Obadiah Prim) in Mrs. Centlivre's comedy A Bold Stroke For A Wife (first produced 1718).The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 130. In the 1815 production of The Apprentice (his debut role), 'The performance of Dick, by Mr. John Bannister, and his admirable recitation of the prologue' (written by Garrick) 'were fortunate instances of that gentleman's comic versatility.'The British Drama, 1824, Vol. 1, p. 69. He never gave up his taste for painting, and Thomas Gainsborough, George Morland and Thomas Rowlandson were among his friends.

They were neighbours to the Veneti people (north-west), the Redones (North), the Andecavi (east) and the Pictones (south).

The latitude and longitude given by Ptolemy for Condevicnum are quite wrong for Nantes.

No man was ever allowed on the island and the women themselves sailed from it to have intercourse with men on the continent before returning there again. They also had the strange custom of unroofing their temple every year and roofing it again on the same day before sunset, each woman bringing her load to add to the roof. The woman whose load would fall out of her arms was rent to pieces by the rest, and they allegedly carried the pieces round the temple with the cry of \\"Ev-ah\\" in a frenetic manner.Strabo, Geography, IV, 4, 6 According to French archaeologist Jean-Louis Brunaux, there are three reasons to consider the story as factual. First, the wet and windy climate of Western Gaul suggest that the Gallic dwellings (made of branches or reed) were re-roofed every year. Second, not to drop new material was, according to Pliny the Elder, a common religious practice of the Celts. Third, circumambulation existed as a rite among the Celts according to Poseidonios.Jean-Louis Brunaux. Les Druides. Des philosophes chez les barbares.

In 1988, Samuel founded picture frame manufacturer D√©cor Frame, now Dekor plc, in Bridgend, South Wales. Bridgend RFC & Celtic Warriors Samuel purchased Bridgend RFC in the mid-1990s. He attempted to merge them with Neath in 2002. Bridgend won the Welsh Championship in 2003. In the summer of 2003, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) voted to reduce the top tier of Welsh rugby union from nine clubs in the Celtic League into five regions through a series of mergers. The new Celtic Warriors officially represented the Mid-Glamorgan Valleys area, which in practice meant that they were a combination of Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC with the two parent clubs continuing in the Welsh Premier Division. Games were to be rotated between Pontypridd's Sardis Road and Bridgend's Brewery Field. To concentrate on the Celtic Warriors, Samuel decided to withdraw his financial backing of Bridgend RFC in March 2004. The original club was finally wound up by HM Revenue and Customs in 2006. Fans and businessmen of the area resurrected the team, naming it Bridgend Ravens as the name Bridgend RFC was still owned by Samuel. Financial problems at Pontypridd RFC led to the sale of their half of the Warriors to Leighton Samuel for ¬£100,000; which he gifted to the WRU, his attempt to become sole owner of the club having been blocked by the WRU. Samuel's attempt to buy Sardis Road's ground lease to be an all-seater stadium for the Celtic Warriors was rejected by the Pontypridd's trustees. Games were moved away from Sardis Road to Brewery Field on commercial grounds, which led to threats of legal action from Pontypridd Supporters Club. Plans to merge Warriors with Cardiff Blues collapsed when Cardiff Athletic Club, the largest shareholders in Cardiff RFC made it clear they would not allow a combined side to use the Arms Park. The merger talks had attracted protests from both sets of fans. Trouble followed in the spring and early summer of 2004 where Leighton Samuel repeatedly threatened and revoked threats of selling the club; one such instance went as far as Samuel accepting an offer from the WRU citing a lack of support from fans in the new Bridgend/Pontypridd region, before changing his mind. This transaction was considered to be legally binding, and the Warriors became 100% owned by the WRU. On the advice of David Moffett who cited spiralling debts, the club was dissolved with Leighton Samuel reportedly receiving ¬£875,000 for his shares. Samuel alleged that he only sold his share in the Warriors to the WRU because they agreed to keep the region going. The WRU denied this but Leighton Samuel took them to court claiming a misrepresentation of sale and loss of earnings from Brewery Field which he still owned. The WRU settled out of court. Pontypridd Town AFC Samuel invested in Pontypridd Town A.F.C. who were playing in Welsh league division 1 with the ambition of promotion to the League of Wales. However, they failed to win promotion and Samuel withdrew his support and the club were subsequently relegated down to Welsh Football League Division Three. Celtic Crusaders Samuel was approached by the Rugby Football League in 2004 to start up Celtic Crusaders rugby league club in Bridgend, the only professional rugby league club in Wales. Celtic Crusaders were initially successful; winning promotion in their second season and being awarded a Super League licence in their third year. Crusaders struggled on the field and only won three games all season. They were also investigated by the UK Borders Authority for employing six players illegally on working holiday and student visas. The six players were later deported and the club was fined ¬£5,000 after providing evidence that checks were made on five of the players before employing them. In February 2009, Samuel reaffirmed his continued interest in the club. He then sold Brewery Field stadium in March 2009Control of Bridgend's Brewery Field changes hands walesonline.co.uk and decided to relocate the club to Rodney Parade, Newport for two years while a suitable venue in Bridgend was constructed. Leighton Samuel sold his interest in Crusaders to Wrexham Village in December 2009 and the club moved to Wrexham in North Wales. Samuel claimed to have put ¬£1.64 million into the club and that the club was relatively free of debt. Crusaders had a much better season finishing eighth in the Super League table and making the play-offs but ran into financial problems at the end of the season. By August 2010, documents showed that there were 18 county court cases against Crusaders, the earliest being December 2006. According to The Sun newspaper, Crusaders went into administration on 2 November 2010 after Samuel served a writ on the Welsh club for ¬£360,000. However, Samuel denied this in a statement to the BBC: \\"It's rubbish. It's absolute rubbish. It's news to me. I've not served a writ. There is toing and froing regarding the transfer of the business but I've taken no legal action\\". The GMB Union stated that they were taking action on behalf of players over alleged missing pensions payments on 12 November 2010. By the end of November, Crusaders finally did go into administration with debts thought to amount to around ¬£1.25 million, most of them inherited from their time in South Wales.

The Rob Roy Way is a Scottish long distance footpath that runs from Drymen in Stirling to Pitlochry in Perth and Kinross. The path was created in 2002, and takes its name from Rob Roy MacGregor, a Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century. It traverses countryside that he knew and travelled frequently. The route crosses the Highland Boundary Fault, a geological fault where the Highlands meet the Lowlands. Views from the trail overlook Loch Lubnaig, Loch Earn, Loch Venachar and Loch Tay. The way is in length if the direct route along the southern shore of Loch Tay and the River Tay is followed between Ardtalnaig and Aberfeldy. An optional loop also links these places via Amulree: choosing this option increases the length by a further to .

Founded in 1784, it had become the largest Sunday school in the world by 1859. The original school was situated on London Square, Wellington Street, Stockport, behind the town hall. Before the days of universal education, children would be employed in the cotton and hatting industry from a very early age, Sunday Schools provided the one source of Education available before the passing of the 1870 Education Act. The school still exists today on Nangreave Rd in Heaviley, though it is far reduced in size. Foundation The Sunday School was founded in 1784, the articles of association being adopted on 11 November 1784. The aim was that the town be divided into six, and an establishment provided for each division. Two subscribers should visit each school and report back to the committee. Scholars should attend from 9 to 12 in the morning, and from 1 to 6 in the afternoon, of which part would be attending a church service of their persuasion. Teachers were to be paid 1s 6d a day. They started with eleven schools, and twenty three teachers taught 700-800 children.Samuel Oldknow and the Arkwrights: the Industrial Revolution at Stockport p40 To put it in historical context John Wesley had visited Stockport on 12 June 1784: One of the schools abandoned the practice of paying teachers and encouraged a large number of unpaid volunteers to do the job. This was successful and it grew faster than the rest. The consequent need for extra books, added to an increase of rent and other expenses, occasioned a demand beyond its proportion of the public subscription. These circumstances led to this school becoming a separate institution independent of the rest, though agreeing with them in the general object, the mode of instruction, the books in use, and the subjects admitted. In the year 1794, a separate committee published a report, entitling the institution, by way of distinction, the Methodists‚Äô Sunday School, most of its promoters and active supporters being of that denomination. That report stated the number of scholars to be 695. In 1805, ¬£6,000 pounds was raised from subscription, and a school large enough to accommodate 5,000 scholars was built on London Square. The school belonged to the town rather than a particular church. The building, austere in design, was 132 feet in length and 57 feet in width. The ground floor and first storey were each divided into 12 rooms; the second storey was fitted up for assembling the whole of the children for public worship, or on other occasions; having two tiers of windows, and a gallery on each side extending about half the length of the building. In order to aid both the hearing and sight in this long room, the floor rose in an inclined plane about half way. There was also an orchestra with an organ behind the pulpit. Stockport Sunday School predates the founding of the Sunday School Society of 1786.  Prominence  The Sunday School, though nominally inter- denominational, was a Protestant institution. It was certainly seen as a threat to the establishment. Indeed, in 1811, a Mr Myddleton, vicar of St Thomas', Heaton Norris, reported to the Bishop: Up until the cotton famine, and the Education Act of 1870 it would be the only source of education for many children. Children would start helping their parents as young as five, and well before ten they would be subject to a fourteen-hour working day. The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802 had attempted to ensure children were instructed in reading, writing and religion but it was not effectively policed. This left the Sunday school, and in 1842 a local directory reports: The school had its own choir, orchestra and music library, it was also had many active sports teams and a growing reputation. The report for 1859 states the number of scholars belonging to this school made it the largest Sunday school in the world, with 3,781 scholars, and 435 teachers. In later years the people moved to Heaviley, leaving the National Sunday School and Centenary Hall vacant. The buildings were listed as a National Monument and were demolished around 1970.Hansard The Stockport Sunday School's enormous registers (now at Stockport Central Library) testify that Stockport Sunday School catered for 3,000 children. The un-indexed registers 1789-1920 have their names and ages (Registers for the Stockport Sunday School, Cheshire, 1790‚Äì1877). Many families sent generation after generation of children to Stockport Sunday school, the age range being from three years to late teenage.https://wiki.familysearch.org/en/England_Schools Family search Manslaughter of George Burgess On 11 April 1861, two eight-year-old boys recently suspended from the school, Peter Barrett and James Bradley, killed two-year-old George Burgess. The toddler was abducted from and smothered in a pool of water near Love Lane. He was last seen by his father, a powerloom weaver, near the Star Inn in Higher Hillgate; the child was being looked after by a nurse when he went missing. Peter Barrett and James Bradley had taken the toddler before stripping him, beating him with sticks, and then suffocating him in the brook. They had been challenged but not stopped by two residents and in court admitted to the crime, blaming each other. There had been a precursor to this incident: on 31 March the pair had been suspended from Stockport Sunday School when they had ripped up two Bibles and other children's caps. James Bradley served 4¬Ω years in the Bradwall Reformatory School, and Peter Barrett was sent to a Reformatory in Warwickshire. George Burgess was buried at Christ Church, Heaton Norris.

When the subject is the agent or doer of the action, the verb is in the active voice. When the subject is the patient, target or undergoer of the action, the verb is said to be in the passive voice. Voice is sometimes called diathesis. For example, in the sentence: :The cat ate the mouse. the verb \\"ate\\" is in the active voice. However, in the sentence: :The mouse was eaten by the cat. the verbal phrase \\"was eaten\\" is passive. In the sentence: :The hunter killed the bear. the verb \\"killed\\" is in the active voice, and the doer of the action is the \\"hunter\\". A passive version of the sentence is: :The bear was killed by the hunter. where the verbal phrase \\"was killed\\" is followed by the word \\"by\\" and then by the doer \\"hunter\\". In a transformation from an active-voice clause to an equivalent passive-voice construction, the subject and the direct object switch grammatical roles. The direct object gets promoted to subject, and the subject demoted to an (optional) adjunct. In the first example above, the mouse serves as the direct object in the active-voice version, but becomes the subject in the passive version. The subject of the active-voice version, the cat, becomes part of a prepositional phrase in the passive version of the sentence, and can be left out entirely. History In the grammar of Ancient Greek, voice was called Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ (di√°thesis) \\"arrangement\\" or \\"condition\\", with three subcategories: active (·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± [en√©rgeia]), passive (œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ [p√°thos]), and middle (ŒºŒµœÉœåœÑŒ∑œÇ [mes√≥tƒìs]).Dionysius Thrax. œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑ Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (Art of Grammar). ŒπŒ≥¬¥ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ·ø•ŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (13. On the verb). In Latin there are two voices: active and passive (Latin: [genus] activum, passivum). Active The active voice is the most commonly used in many languages and represents the \\"normal\\" case, in which the subject of the verb is the agent. In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action or causes the happening denoted by the verb. Example: Kabaisa ate the potatoes. The verb ate indicates the active voice. But consider the following sentence which is in passive voice: The potatoes were eaten by Kabaisa. The words were eaten indicate the passive voice. The passive voice shows that something has been acted upon by someone or something else. Passive The passive voice is employed in a clause whose subject expresses the theme or patient of the verb. That is, it undergoes an action or has its state changed.O'Grady, William, John Archibald, Mark Aronoff, and Janie Rees-Miller (eds.) (2001). Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction Fourth edition. Boston: Bedord/St. Martin's. In the passive voice, the grammatical subject of the verb is the recipient (not the doer) of the action denoted by the verb. Some languages, such as English and Spanish, use a periphrastic passive voice; that is, it is not a single word form, but rather a construction making use of other word forms. Specifically, it is made up of a form of the auxiliary verb to be and a past participle of the main verb. In other languages, such as Latin, the passive voice for some tenses is simply marked on the verb by inflection: librum legit \\"He reads the book\\"; liber legitur \\"The book is read\\". Middle Some languages (such as Albanian, Bengali, Fula, Tamil, Sanskrit, Icelandic, Swedish, Biblical Hebrew, Modern Hebrew and Ancient Greek) have a middle voice, which is a set of inflections or constructions which is to some extent different from both the active and passive voices. In some cases, the middle voice is any grammatical option where the subject of a material process cannot be categorized as either an Actor (someone doing something) or a Goal (that at which the actor aims their work). For example, while the passive voice expresses a Medium (Goal) being affected by an external Agent (Actor) as in The casserole was cooked in the oven, the middle voice expresses a Medium undergoing change without any external Agent The casserole cooked in the oven. In English, the inflections and constructions for middle voice and active voice are the same for these cases. In other cases such as in Classical Greek, the middle voice is often used for material processes where the Subject is both the Actor (the one doing the action) and the Medium (that which is undergoing change) as in \\"the man got a shave\\", opposing both active and passive voices where the Medium is the Goal as in \\"the barber shaved the man\\" and \\"the man got shaved by the barber\\". Finally, it can occasionally be used in a causative sense, such as \\"The father causes his son to be set free\\", or \\"The father ransoms his son\\". In English there is no verb form for the middle voice, though some uses may be classified by traditional grammarians as middle voice, often resolved via a reflexive pronoun, as in \\"Fred shaved\\", which may be expanded to \\"Fred shaved himself\\" ‚Äì contrast with active \\"Fred shaved John\\" or passive \\"John was shaved by Fred\\". This need not be reflexive, as in \\"my clothes soaked in detergent overnight\\". English used to have a distinct form, called the passival, which was displaced over the early 19th century by the progressive passive and is no longer used in English.Mike Vuolo, \\"The House is Building\\"? Why you never learned the passival tense, even though it used to be proper English grammar., Slate, May 29, 2012 In the passival, one might say \\"The house is building.\\", which may today be rendered instead as \\"The house is being built.\\" Likewise \\"The meal is eating.\\", which is now \\"The meal is being eaten.\\" Note that the similar \\"Fred is shaving\\" and \\"The meal is cooking\\" remain grammatical. It is suggested that the progressive passive was popularized by the Romantic poets, and is connected with Bristol usage.Platt and Denison, \\"The language of the Southey- Coleridge Circle\\", Language Sciences 2000 Many deponent verbs in Latin (i.e., verbs passive in form but active in meaning) are survivals of the Proto-Indo- European middle voice.Sihler, Andrew L, \\"New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\\", 1995, Oxford University Press Others Some languages have even more grammatical voices. For example, Classical Mongolian features five voices: active, passive, causative, reciprocal, and cooperative. Hebrew has active, passive, causative, causative-passive, intensive, intensive-passive and reflexive voices. The antipassive voice deletes or demotes the object of transitive verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among ergative‚Äìabsolutive languages (which may feature passive voices as well), but also occurs among nominative‚Äìaccusative languages. There are also constructions in some languages that appear to change the valence of a verb, but in fact do not. So called hierarchical or inversion languages are of this sort. Their agreement system will be sensitive to an external person or animacy hierarchy (or a combination of both): 1 > 2 > 3 or Anim > Inan and so forth. E.g., in Meskwaki (an Algonquian language), verbs inflect for both subject and object, but agreement markers do not have inherent values for these. Rather, a third marker, the direct or inverse marker, indicates the proper interpretation: ne-wa:pam-e:-w-a [1-look.at- DIR-3-3Sg] \\"I am looking at him\\", but ne-wa:pam-ekw-w-a [1-look.at-INV-3-3Sg] \\"He is looking at me\\". Some scholars (notably Rhodes) have analyzed this as a kind of obligatory passivization dependent on animacy, while others have claimed it is not a voice at all, but rather see inversion as another type of alignment, parallel to nominative‚Äìaccusative, ergative‚Äìabsolutive, split-S, and fluid-S alignments. Passive in topic-prominent languages  Chinese   Mandarin  Topic-prominent languages like Mandarin tend not to employ the passive voice as frequently. In general, Mandarin is best analyzed as using middle voice, but Mandarin-speakers can construct a passive voice by using the coverb (b√®i) and rearranging the usual word order.Li & Thompson (1981) For example, this sentence using active voice: Note: the first line is in Traditional Chinese while the second is Simplified Chinese. : corresponds to the following sentence using passive voice. Note that the agent phrase is optional. : In addition, through the addition of the auxiliary verb \\"to be\\" (sh√¨) the passive voice is frequently used to emphasize the identity of the actor. This example places emphasis on the dog, presumably as opposed to some other animal: : Mandarin has also an object-retaining passive which contains both object and topic (mostly the possessor of the object): : Ë¢´ (b√®i) as a passive marker is a relatively new addition to the language, introduced as part of the early 20th century language reforms that also added gender- specific pronouns such as ‰ªñ>Â•π and ‰Ω†>Â¶≥ and culminated in attempts to romanize Chinese entirely. Classically, Ë¢´ marked an adversative mood, indicating that something bad had happened. Even today, the following sentence is perfectly acceptable in speechÔºö : In general, Chinese employs middle voice.https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/bitstream/handle/10066/10847/Baglini_thesis_2007.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed;=y For a fuller treatment of Chinese morphosyntax see He, Xiaoling, Patient- Subject Constructions In Mandarin Chinese: Syntax, Semantics, Discourse. See also the discussion in works such as Li, Charles N; Thompson, Sandra A, where, arguing against Chao's analysis of Mandarin, the two dispute that there is a distinct class of middle voice verbs, but in so doing recognize that Mandarin (and Cantonese) verbs as a whole behave the same way.  Cantonese  In Cantonese, those features are quite similar by using the coverb (bei2), but the agent phrase is NOT optional, often with a formal agent (jan4): : : However, in some dialects of Yue, a passive voice with an optional agent phrase is also available: Qinzhou (Qin-Lian Yue): : In the actor-emphasizing passive voice of Cantonese, besides the addition of the auxiliary verb \\"to be\\" (hai6), the perfective event is also converted to an adjective-like predicative with the suffix (ge3) or (gaa3), which is a more emphasized one from the liaison of (ge3) and (aa3): :  Japanese  Although a topic- prominent language, Japanese employs the passive voice quite frequently, and has two types of passive voice, one that corresponds to that in English and an indirect passive not found in English. This indirect passive is used when something undesirable happens to the speaker. : : Impersonal voice While in ordinary passive voice, the object of the action becomes the subject of the sentence, in impersonal passive voice, it remains the grammatical object. The subject can be replaced with an impersonal pronoun, as in English One reads the newspaper, French On lit le journal, or German Man liest die Zeitung. (\\"The newspaper is (being) read\\"). Similar constructions are sometimes used in English, as in \\"One reads the newspaper\\"; \\"you\\" and \\"they\\" can also be used in an impersonal sense In other languages, the subject is omitted and a specific impersonal form of the verb is used. Finnic languages Verbs in the Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, have an impersonal voice, often simply called the passive (Finnish: passiivi, Estonian: umbisikuline tegumood), which omits the subject and retains the grammatical role of the object. It has also been called the \\"zero person\\". In Estonian: :Naised loevad ajalehte. Women read the newspaper. :Ajalehte loetakse. The newspaper is (being) read. In Estonian, the agent can be included by using the postposition poolt, although using such a construction instead of the active voice is critisised as a foreiginism (influenced by German, Russian and English) and characteristic of officialese. :Ajalehte loetakse naiste poolt. The newspaper is read by women. In both Finnish and Estonian, the use of the impersonal voice generally implies that the agent is capable of own initiative . For example, Finnish Ikkuna hajotettiin (\\"The window was broken\\") would generally not be used if the window was broken by the wind, rather than a person. In the latter case, one could instead use a reflexive (anticausative) verb in the active voice, such as Ikkuna hajosi (\\"The window broke\\"). Celtic languages Celtic languages have an inflection commonly called the \\"impersonal\\" or \\"autonomous\\" form, of similar origin to the Latin \\"passive- impersonal\\". This is similar to a passive construction in that the agent of the verb is not specified. However its syntax is different from prototypical passives, in that the object of the action remains in the accusative. It is similar to the use of the pronoun \\"on\\" in French (except wherever \\"on\\" is instead used an alternative to \\"we\\", which is very frequent). It increasingly corresponds to the passive in modern English, in which there is a trend towards avoiding the use of the passive unless it is specifically required to omit the subject. It also appears to be similar to the \\"fourth person\\" mentioned in the preceding paragraph. However, what is called in Irish an briathar saor or the free verb does not suggest passivity but a kind of generalised agency. The construction has equal validity in transitive and intransitive clauses, and the best translation into English is normally by using the \\"dummy\\" subjects \\"they\\", \\"one\\", or impersonal \\"you\\". For example, the common sign against tobacco consumption has its closest direct translation in English as \\"No smoking\\": : An example of its use as an intransitive is: : The difference between the autonomous and a true passive is that while the autonomous focuses on the action and overtly avoids mentioning the actor, there is nonetheless an anonymous agent who may be referred to in the sentence. For instance: : In English, the formation of the passive allows the optional inclusion of an agent in a prepositional phrase, \\"by the man\\", etc. Where English would leave out the noun phrase, Irish uses the autonomous; where English includes the noun phrase, Irish uses its periphrastic passive ‚Äì which can also leave out the noun phrase: : The impersonal endings have been re-analysed as a passive voice in Modern Welsh and the agent can be included after the preposition gan (by): :Darllenir y papur newydd. The newspaper is read. :Cenir y g√¢n gan y c√¥r. :The song is sung by the choir. Dynamic and static passive Some linguists draw a distinction between static (or stative) passive voice and dynamic (or eventive) passive voice in some languages. Examples include English, German, Swedish, Spanish and Italian. \\"Static\\" means that an action was done to the subject at a certain point in time resulting in a state in the time focussed upon, whereas \\"dynamic\\" means that an action takes place. German * Static passive auxiliary verb: sein * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: werden : Der Rasen ist gem√§ht (\\"The lawn is mown\\", static) : Der Rasen wird gem√§ht (\\"The lawn is being mown\\", literally \\"The lawn becomes mown\\", dynamic) English * Static passive auxiliary verb: be (the \\"be-passive\\") * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: get (the \\"get-passive\\") Note that for some speakers of English the dynamic passive constructed with get is not accepted and is considered colloquial or sub-standard. : The grass is cut (static) : The grass gets cut or The grass is being cut (dynamic) Swedish * Static passive auxiliary verb: vara (√§r, var, varit) * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: bli (blir, blev, blivit) Dynamic passive in Swedish is also frequently expressed with the s-ending. : D√∂rren √§r √∂ppnad. \\"The door has been opened.\\" : D√∂rren blir √∂ppnad. \\"The door is being opened.\\" The vara passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, simply using the corresponding adjective: :D√∂rren √§r √∂ppen. \\"The door is open.\\" The bli passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, the s-passive: :D√∂rren √∂ppnas. \\"The door is opening.\\" Spanish Spanish has two verbs corresponding to English to be: ser and estar. Ser is used to form the ordinary (dynamic) passive voice: :La puerta es abierta. \\"The door is [being] opened [by someone]\\" :La puerta es cerrada. \\"The door is [being] closed [by someone]\\" However, this construction is very unidiomatic. The usual passive voice is the se pasiva, in which the verb is conjugated in the active voice, but preceded by the se particle: :La puerta se abre. :La puerta se cierra. Estar is used to form what might be termed a static passive voice (not regarded as a passive voice in traditional Spanish grammar): :La puerta est√° abierta. \\"The door is open.\\", i.e., it has been opened. :La puerta est√° cerrada. \\"The door is closed.\\", i.e., it has been closed. In the ser and estar cases, the verb's participle is used as the complement (as is sometimes the case in English). Italian Italian uses two verbs (essere and venire) to translate the static and the dynamic passive: Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: essere and venire (to be and to come) :La porta √® aperta. or La porta viene aperta. \\"The door is opened [by someone]\\" or \\"The door comes open [by someone]\\". :La porta √® chiusa. or La porta viene chiusa. \\"The door is closed [by someone]\\" or \\"The door comes closed [by someone]\\". Static passive auxiliary verb: essere (to be) :La porta √® aperta. \\"The door is open,\\" i.e., it has been opened. :La porta √® chiusa. \\"The door is closed,\\" i.e., it has been closed. Venetian In Venetian (V√®neto) the difference between dynamic (true) passive and stative (adjectival) passive is more clear cut, using √®ser (to be) only for the static passives and vegner (to become, to come) only for the dynamic passive: :≈Åa porta ≈Ça vien verta. \\"The door is opened\\", dynamic :≈Åa porta ≈Ça x√® / l'√® verta. \\"The door is open\\", static Static forms represents much more a property or general condition, whereas the dynamic form is a real passive action entailing \\"by someone\\": :√®ser proteto. \\"To be protected = to be in a safe condition\\", static :vegner proteto. \\"To be protected = to be defended (by so)\\", dynamic :√®ser considar√†. \\"To be considered = to have a (good) reputation\\", static :vegner considar√†. \\"To be taken into consideration (by people, by so)\\", dynamic :√®ser raprexent√† (a l'ONU). \\"To be represented (at the UN) = to have a representation\\", static :vegner raprexent√† a l'ONU (da un de≈Çeg√†). \\"To be represented at the UN (by a delegate)\\", dynamic  List of voices  Voices found in various languages include: * Active voice * Adjutative voice * Antipassive voice * Applicative voice * Causative voice * Circumstantial voice * Impersonal passive voice * Mediopassive voice * Medium voice = middle voice * Neuter voice * Passive voice * Reciprocal voice (subject and object perform the verbal action to each other, e.g., She and I cut each other's hair) * Reflexive voice (the subject and the object of the verb are the same, as in I see myself (in the mirror)) See also *Anticausative verb *Dative shift *Deponent verb *Description *Diathesis alternation *English passive voice *E-Prime *Grammatical conjugation *Morphosyntactic alignment *Unaccusative verb *Valency (linguistics) Notes References * Category:Grammar ","title":"Voice (grammar)"},{"id":"24687388","text":"Robert Gray (1762‚Äì1834) was an English Bishop of Bristol. Life Born 11 March 1762, he was the son of Robert Gray, a London silversmith. Having entered St Mary Hall, Oxford, he graduated B.A. 1784, M. A, 1787, B.D. 1799, and D.D. 1802. Soon after 1790 he was presented to the vicarage of Faringdon, Berkshire. In 1796 he was appointed Bampton lecturer, and his discourses were published the same year, under the title of Sermons on the Principles upon which the Reformation of the Church of England was established. Through the favour of Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham, he was promoted, in 1800, to the rectory of Crayke, Yorkshire, and resigned Faringdon; in 1804 he was collated by Barrington to the seventh stall in Durham Cathedral, and again, in 1805, to the rectory of Bishopswearmouth, and resigned Crayke. He held this living, in which he had succeeded William Paley, until his elevation, in 1827, to the bishopric of Bristol. In 1815, when he was Vicar of Bishopwearmouth, Robert Gray played an important part in one of the most important moments in the industrialisation of the World. After witnessing many mining accidents, it was Gray that wrote to Humphry Davy asking for his help with the problem of providing light safely in the local underground collieries. As a result, Davy visited the Northeast of England in August 1815 and discussed the problem with Colliery owners and mining expert John Buddle. Davy took samples of the gas to his London laboratory and designed his famous \\"miners lamp\\". Buddle was one of the first people to test the lamp. Stating in a report from the Select Committee on Accidents in Mines on the 4 September 1835 \\"I first tried the lamp in an explosive mixture on the surface; and then took it to the mine; it is impossible for me to express my feelings at the time when I first suspended the lamp in the mine and saw it red hot. I said to those around me: \\"We have at last subdued this monster [fire-damp].\\" Thus is recorded one of the most significant moments in the industrialization of the world. Davy did not patent his lamp effectively giving it to the Nation and the miners of the world. During the Bristol riots of 1831, when one of the minor canons suggested a postponement of divine service, since the rioters were masters of the city, Gray replied that it was his duty to be at his post. The 3rd Dragoon Guards violently suppressing the Bristol Riots of 1831. The service was held as usual, and he was himself the preacher. Before the close of the evening his palace was burned to the ground, and the loss which he sustained was estimated at ¬£10,000. He died at Rodney House, Clifton, 28 September 1834, and was buried in the graveyard attached to Bristol Cathedral. A marble monument by Edward H. Bayly was erected in the cathedral. His wife was Elizabeth, sister of Alderman Camplin of Bristol, with whom he had numerous children; including Robert Gray who became Bishop of Cape Town and Metropolitan of Africa. Works His first literary undertaking was his 'Key to the Old testament and Apocrypha; or, an Account of their several Books, their Contents and Authors, and of the Times in which they were respectively written;' a work compiled on the plan of Thomas Percy's 'Key to the New Testament,' first published in 1790, and repeatedly reprinted. In 1793 he published 'Discourses on various subjects, illustrative of the Evidence, Influence, and Doctrines of Christianity;' and in 1794, 'Letters during the course of a Tour through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, in 1791 and 1792.' Gray also published sermons, and the following: * 'Religious Union,' a sketch of a plan for uniting Roman Catholics and presbyterians with the established church, 1800. * 'A Dialogue between a Churchman and a Methodist,' 1802, 5th edit. 1810. * 'Theory of Dreams,' 2 vols., 1808, anonymous. * 'Discourse at Bishopswearmouth', 1812, on the assassination of Spencer Perceval. * 'The Connection between the Sacred Writings and the Literature of the Jewish and Heathen Authors, particularly that of the Classical Ages,' &c.;, 2 vols., 1816; 2nd edition 1819.

Babiƒá and Subotiƒá argue against earlier opinions based on a partly preserved inscription, in Greek, that the icon was a gift of the Empress Helena Draga≈°, wife of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391-1425). They suggest that the donor may be Helena/Euthymia, who as a wife of a Despot would have had, in the late period, the title of vasilissa.

It is named after Canadian priest Louis Babel. It was established on January 30, 1991.Commission de Toponymie Qu√©bec With an area of 23,540 hectares, which makes it - by far - the largest of the entire Quebec network, the Louis-Babel Ecological Reserve occupies Mount Babel, in the northern part of the Ren√©-Levasseur Island (Manicouagan Reservoir). It is located in unorganized territory of the Regional County Municipality of Manicouagan. This ecological reserve protects boreal, montane and alpine ecosystems in the Toulnustouc River ecological region (domain of the black spruce-fir and moss forest) and that of the Lac Marceau summits (domain of the black spruce fir forest). It also protects a site of exceptional geological interest since it is one of five Quebec sites characterized by a shock metamorphism structure. The relief of √éle Ren√©-Levasseur is hilly. Its central part is surmounted by the Mount Babel, mountainous terrain and very rugged. The altitude varies from 350 to 940 meters. This island has long been of interest to geologists because of its shock metamorphism structure. Its origin is linked to the impact of a celestial body, which dates back to 210 million years ago. This meteorite impact formed a crater, the largest and most complex in Canada. Mount Babel and a strip of land averaging six kilometers in width in the center of the island are the two main areas of shock metamorphism that resulted from the rebound of the crater center. Anorthosite, quartz and feldspar constitute the principal rocks. Mount Babel is further characterized by a zeolite deposit, a semi-precious stone. This bedrock has been covered by generally thick tills.

A common example is haemoglobin, which contains a heme cofactor, which is the iron-containing molecule that makes oxygenated blood appear red. Other examples of chromoproteins include other hemochromes, cytochromes, phytochromes and flavoproteins. In hemoglobin there exists a chromoprotein (tetramer MW:4 x 16.125 =64.500), namely heme, consisting of Fe++ four pyrrol rings. A single chromoprotein can act as both a phytochrome and a phototropin due to the presence and processing of multiple chromophores. Phytochrome in ferns contains PHY3 which contains an unusual photoreceptor with a dual-channel possessing both phytochrome (red-light sensing) and phototropin (blue-light sensing) and this helps the growth of fern plants at low sunlight. The GFP protein family includes both fluorescent proteins and non-fluorescent chromoproteins. Through mutagenesis or irradiation, the non- fluorescent chromoproteins can be converted to fluorescent chromoproteins. An example of such converted chromoprotein is \\"kindling fluorescent proteins\\" or KFP1 which was converted from a mutated non-fluorescent Anemonia sulcata chromoprotein to a fluorescent chromoprotein. Sea anemones contain purple chromoprotein shCP with its GFP-like chromophore in the trans-conformation. The chromophore is derived from Glu-63, Tyr-64 and Gly-65 and the phenolic group of Tyr-64 plays a vital role in the formation of a conjugated system with the imidazolidone moiety resulting a high absorbance in the absorption spectrum of chromoprotein in the excited state. The replacement of Tyrosine with other amino acids leads to the alteration of optical and non-planer properties of the chromoprotein. Fluorescent proteins such as anthrozoa chromoproteins emit long wavelengths  References  Category:Biological pigments Category:Proteins ","title":"Chromoprotein"},{"id":"24687518","text":"Indigenous Peoples' DaySometimes punctuated Indigenous \\"Peoples\\" or incorrectly \\"People's\\" Day is a holiday that celebrates and honors Native American peoples and commemorates their histories and cultures. It is celebrated across the United States on the second Monday in October, and is an official city and state holiday in various localities. It began as a counter- celebration held on the same day as the U.S. federal holiday of Columbus Day, which honors Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. Many reject celebrating him, saying that he represents \\"the violent history of the colonization in the Western Hemisphere\\", and that Columbus Day is a sanitization or covering-up of Christopher Columbus' actions such as enslaving Native Americans. It was instituted in Berkeley, California, in 1992, to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas on October 12, 1492. Two years later, Santa Cruz, California, instituted the holiday. Starting in 2014, many other cities and states adopted the holiday. History In 1990, the International Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas, sponsored by the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, began to discuss replacing Columbus Day in the United States with a celebration to be known as Indigenous Peoples' Day. Similarly, Native American groups staged a sort of protest in Boston instead of Thanksgiving, which has been celebrated there to mark collaboration between Massachusetts colonists and Native Americans in the first years. In July 1990, at the First Continental Conference on 500 Years of Indian Resistance in Quito, Ecuador, representatives of indigenous people throughout the Americas agreed that they would mark 1992, the 500th anniversary of the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus, as a year to promote \\"continental unity\\" and \\"liberation\\". After the conference, attendees from Northern California organized protests against the \\"Quincentennial Jubilee\\" that had been organized by the United States Congress for the San Francisco Bay Area on Columbus Day in 1992 . It was to include replicas of Columbus's ships sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge and reenacting their \\"discovery\\" of America. The delegates formed the Bay Area Indian Alliance and in turn, the \\"Resistance 500\\" task force. It promoted the idea that Columbus's \\"discovery\\" of inhabited lands and the subsequent European colonization of them had resulted in the genocide of indigenous peoples because of the decisions which were made by colonial and national governments. In 1992, the group convinced the city council of Berkeley, California, to declare October 12 as a \\"Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People\\" and 1992 as the \\"Year of Indigenous People\\". The city implemented related programs in schools, libraries, and museums. The city symbolically renamed Columbus Day as \\"Indigenous Peoples' Day\\" beginning in 1992 to protest the historical conquest of North America by Europeans, and to call attention to the losses suffered by the Native American peoples and their cultures through diseases, warfare, massacres, and forced assimilation.Get Lost (Again) Columbus, an opera by a Native American composer, White Cloud Wolfhawk, was produced that day. Berkeley has celebrated Indigenous Peoples' Day ever since. Beginning in 1993, Berkeley has also held an annual pow wow and festival on Indigenous Peoples' Day. In the years following Berkeley's action, other local governments and institutions have either renamed or canceled Columbus Day, either to celebrate Native American history and cultures, to avoid celebrating Columbus and the European colonization of the Americas, or due to raised controversy over the legacy of Columbus. Several other California cities, including Richmond, Santa Cruz, and Sebastopol, now celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day and encourage people to donate to a neighboring tribe and recognize the trauma and pain indigenous peoples have been subjected to by colonizers. At least thirteen states do not celebrate Columbus Day (Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, DC; Wisconsin); South Dakota officially celebrates Native American Day instead. Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day as \\"Native American Day\\", or have renamed the day after their own tribes. In 2013, the California state legislature considered a bill, AB55, to formally replace Columbus Day with Native American Day but did not pass it.In December 2015 The Belfast, Maine City Council approved a resolution to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, making it the first city east of the Mississippi to take this historic step. It was first celebrated in October 2016 with a weekend of events planned and produced in full cooperation with our local Wabanaki communities, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq. On August 30, 2017, following similar affirmative votes in Oberlin, Ohio, followed later by Bangor, Maine in the earlier weeks of the same month, the Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day. On October 10, 2019, just a few days before Columbus Day would be celebrated in Washington, D.C., the D.C. Council voted to temporarily replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day. This bill was led by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) and must undergo congressional approval to become permanent. Other celebrations Numerous efforts in North America have honored Native American people as part of Columbus Day, or by designating two holidays for the same date. Especially since Native American activism has increased since the 1960s and 1970s, a variety of protests have been staged against celebrating Columbus Day. These have included mock trials of Christopher Columbus in St. Paul, Minnesota, and protests and disruptions of Columbus Day parades in the United States.Keith Coffman, \\"Columbus Day protest in Denver leads to arrests\\", Reuters, October 6, 2007. Indigenous peoples in other nations have also lobbied to have holidays established to recognize their contributions and history. In South America, for instance, Brazil celebrates \\"National Indigenous Peoples' Day\\" on April 19. In Asia, Taiwan designated August 1 as Indigenous Peoples' Day in 2016 under the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen, who announced that the government is committed to promoting the rights of Taiwan‚Äôs indigenous peoples and enhancing public awareness of their culture and history. In the Philippines, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, as well as various local indigenous towns, designated October 29, 2008, as Indigenous Peoples' Day. Native American Day Some states celebrate a separate but similar Native American Day, however this is observed not on Columbus Day but in September. Those who observe include the states of California and Tennessee.  International Day of the World's Indigenous People  In 1994, .declared an International Day of the World's Indigenous People, establishing it on August 9. This international holiday has been celebrated also in various nations.

Prior to January 22, 1992, it was in D'Autray Regional County Municipality.http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/pdf/Mod1992.pdf History Starting in 1790, the first few settler families arrived from the La Noraye Seignory and settled in the North and South concessions of the area, then called North Jersey. The origin of this name is not known but may be a phonetic deformation of Chertsey, the name of a neighboring district. In the 1830s, the parish of Sainte-√âlisabeth became overcrowded and many of its inhabitants moved to North Jersey, forming a new village called Saint-Thomas- de-North-Jersey from 1838 onwards. That same year, the Parish of Saint-Thomas was formed on November 15. It was named in honour of Thomas-L√©andre Brassard (1805-1891), pastor of Sainte-√âlisabeth-de-Joliette at that time. By 1839, Saint-Thomas had 930 inhabitants. In 1845, the Municipality of Saint-Thomas- de-North-Jersey was formed when it separated from parts of Sainte-√âlisabeth, Lanoraie, and Saint-Paul-de-Lavaltrie. One of the leading persons advocating for its formation was Louis Voligny, a former French officer who is considered the founder of St. Thomas. He donated land for the construction of the church, the presbytery, and for the establishment of the cemetery. Voligny was also elected as the first mayor and his son Felix Voligny was secretary-treasurer. Consequently, the place was also known as Saint-Thomas-de-Voligny for a period of time. In 1847, the municipality was abolished but reestablished in 1855 as a parish municipality, with Joseph Masse elected as mayor. In 1993, it changed status and became the Municipality of Saint-Thomas. Because of Saint-Thomas' sandy soil, tobacco began to be cultivated in the area starting in the 1930s. It became the dominatant crop, making Saint-Thomas the national tobacco capital and the largest tobacco producer in the province until 1980. Since then, tobacco has been supplanted by potatoes and is no longer cultivated there.

It is part of the Stari Ras complex, an UNESCO World Heritage Site.Bradt, Serbia It was founded in the 4th century during Roman rule, while additions were made in the 7th and 9th centuries, after which it served as the ecclesiastical seat of the Serbian church, and as the baptismal church and state council site of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, until the last years of the 12th century. It is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. History Early The exact date of founding is unknown; it is mentioned in the 9th century as the seat of the eparchy of Serbia (see Eparchy of Ras). Excavations on the site have unearthed Greek sculptures and Black-figure pottery dating to 7th and 6th century BC, as well as a 5th-century BC princely grave (with regalia, robes, gold-silver jewelry, masks, beads and Attic pottery), underneath the floor of the church in 1957‚Äì58.Trebenishte: the fortunes of an unusual excavation - M. Stibbe, Rastko Vasiƒá The findings are presently at the National Museum of Serbia, in Belgrade. Roman, Byzantine and medieval Slavic tombs surround the church. The present church has been built on several earlier churches of which remains have been well preserved. The foundation of the church, the massive columns, ground-plan and the octagonal tower which conceals an inner cupola are examples of the circular mausoleal architectural type used after Emperor Constantine (306‚Äì312). Archaeological findings point that the church has been rebuilt several times in history, beginning in the 4th century, with notable additions made in the 7th century. The architectural style resembles that of early churches in Pomorje, Armenia, Georgia, and Italy, dated to between the 7th and 9th centuries. Middle Ages The Church and old graveyard. The Church The first Serbian bishopric (Eparchy of Ras) was founded at the political center at Ras, near modern Novi Pazar on the Ibar river.The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, pg. 208 Ras itself originates from ancient Arsa,Mrkobrad and it is mentioned as a Serbian town in Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (r. 913‚Äì959). The initial ecclesiastical affiliation is uncertain, it was subordinate to either Split or Durazzo, both then Byzantine (Patriarchate of Constantinople). The church served as the seat of the Serbian eparchy, as the rotunda plan is characteristic of first court chapels. The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 209 The bishopric was established shortly after 871, during the rule of Prince Mutimir (r. 850-891), and was part of the general plan of establishing bishoprics in the Slav lands of the Empire, confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 879-880.Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Raska and Prizren Similarly, the Eparchy of Braniƒçevo was founded in 878 (as continuation of Viminacium and Horreum Margi). Prince Petar (r. 892-917), was entombed in the church.CHRONICLE OF THE PRIEST OF DUKLJA (Ljetopis' Popa Dukljanina) Christianity was spreading in his time.The early medieval Balkans, pg. 141 Prince ƒåaslav (r. 927‚Äì960) may have added the frescoes, which are dated to the 10th century. Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes (r. 969-976) recognized the Ras region as being the \\"focus of the Serbian lands\\", amid his annexation of the region (organizing it into a Catepanate). The Eparchy of Ras was organized into the newly established Archbishopric of Ohrid (1018), amid the renewed annexation of the region (organizing it into a Theme), as part of a wider Byzantine-Slavic Orthodox area. In the chrysobulls of Emperor Basil II, dated 1020, the Eparchy of Ras is mentioned as serving the whole of Serbia, confirming the church as ecclesiastical seat. The Church and gravestones Sometime before 1163, Stefan Nemanja, then only a Prince, was baptized in the church. In 1166, Stefan Nemanja acquired the throne of Serbia with the title of Grand Prince. He was married in the church (to Ana); their two sons, Rastko (later known as Saint Sava; l. 1175-1235), and Stefan Nemanjiƒá, were baptized in the church. Stefan Nemanja held the council that outlawed the Bogumils at the church. Rastko left Serbia in 1192 for Mount Athos, where he took monastic vows and was given the name Sava.ƒêuro ≈†urmin, Povjest knji≈æevnosti hrvatske i srpske, 1808, p. 229The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 218 Stefan Nemanja abdicated in 1195, crowning Stefan Nemanjiƒá (r. 1196-1228) at the Church of Peter, then joined his son Sava on Mount Athos. The father and son soon asked the Holy Community for the establishment of the Serbian religious base at the abandoned Hilandar, which they renovated, marking the beginning of cultural prospering (in arts; literature, and religion). The ancient cell of Helandaris was donated by Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195-1203) \\"to the Serbs as an eternal gift...\\" and Stefan Nemanja establishes and endows the monastery in 1198 (before 13 February 1199).Tibor Zivkovic - Charters of the Serbian rulers related to Kosovo and Metochia, pg. 15 Nemanja died at Hilandar in 1199, while Sava continued his work in establishing the Serbian church. Henceforth, the Church of Peter ends its service as the seat of the Serbian church. Sava crowned his brother Stefan as \\"King of Serbia\\" in 1217. Upon returning to Mount Athos, Sava is consecrated as the first Archbishop of the Serbian church, given autocephaly by Patriarch Manuel I of Constantinople, in 1219, the same year he published the first constitution in Serbia ‚Äì St. Sava's Nomocanon (Zakonopravilo in Serbian).pg. 118 After the Nemanjiƒá era, not much is mentioned about the church. The church frescoes date to the 10th, 12th and 13th centuries, while some frescoes were repainted in the mid-13th century. Early modern After the Ottoman conquest in 1455, the church was not abandoned and is referenced throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1690, the Church is abandoned and the region is largely depopulated amid Ottoman atrocities in Kosovo, amid the Great Turkish War in which Serb rebels fought on the side of the Holy League. Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá leads tens of thousands of Serb families to the Christian north. Metropolitan Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta restored the church in 1728. During the 18th century, the church had the rank of Metropolitanate, and after 1784, the Eparchy of Ra≈°ka is organized into the Eparchy of Prizren. In the 1830s, the church is built on and restored. Shortly thereafter, the Ottomans took over the church and use it as an ammunition magazine. Since the First Balkan War (1912), it has been a functioning church. Contemporary Conservatory work was done in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Stari Ras-complex, including the church and Sopoƒáani, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the church itself was included due to its uniqueness as one of the oldest churches in the region. It is designated a Cultural Heritage Site of Serbia (the national heritage list), of the Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance type. The church's walls were defaced with graffiti on 6 April 2008. The police have not officially concluded who perpetrated the act or why.

(Under a 1972 state constitutional amendment, the terms were doubled in 1974 to the current four years.) Eggers' races for governor were his only attempts at elected office. At the time, he was a largely unknown tax attorney in Wichita Falls in North Texas. By 1970, Eggers had relocated from Wichita Falls to Dallas. He was a close friend and associate of Republican U.S. Senator John G. Tower. Eggers' amiable personality was shown in his campaign posters, and he waged aggressive though underfunded races against the conservative Democratic nominee, Preston Smith, a theater owner from Lubbock, who was the lieutenant governor under retiring Governor John B. Connally, Jr. Background Eggers was born to a minister, Ernest H. Eggers, and the former Ottilie W. Carre in Seymour in Jackson County in southern Indiana. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941 from Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana, where he played football. In 1978, Valparaiso University named him a \\"Distinguished Alumnus\\". He served in World War II as a major in the United States Army Air Forces. He was honorably discharged in 1946 and on December 29 of that year married Frances Kramer. They had one son, Steven Paul Eggers (born 1957) of Dallas.Who's Who in America, 52nd ed., Vol. I (1998), p. 1200 In 1948, Eggers received his J.D. degree from the University of Texas School of Law at Austin and was thereafter licensed to practice in Texas. After his divorce from his first wife, Eggers married Virginia McMillin (born 1928) on February 23, 1974. He was in private practice and a partner in three law firms, Eggers, Sherrill, & Pace (1952‚Äì1969) in Wichita Falls and Eggers & Wylie (1977‚Äì1979), and Eggers & Greene (1979‚Äì1993), both in Dallas. Eggers was a long-term active member of the Episcopal Church. He was chancellor of the Diocese of Dallas from 1978 to 1992, when he was designated chancellor-emeritus. In 1967, Eggers headed a citizens group which developed plans to open the first senior citizens center in Wichita Falls for leisure activities for persons sixty years of age and older. The center, which offers dances, book reviews, lectures, and hot lunches, opened in May 1968. The project began on a three-year trial basis and became an integral part of Senior Citizens Services of North Texas. About the time that work began on the senior citizens center, Eggers was named to the board of directors of the City National Bank of Wichita Falls. The 1968 campaign To secure the 1968 party nomination, Eggers, with 65,501 votes (62.5 percent), handily defeated two challengers, John Trice (28,849) and Wallace Sisk (10,415). In 1964, Trice had been the GOP candidate for Texas Attorney General against the incumbent Waggoner Carr, who two years later was the Democratic opponent of Senator Tower. The Republican primary vote for all three intraparty rivals was only 5.6 percent of the total Democratic primary turnout. Time called Eggers a \\"virtually unknown candidate who is unlikely to make Texas history by becoming the first Republican Governor since Reconstruction.\\" Preston Smith won the 1968 nomination in a runoff against the liberal Don Yarborough of Houston, no relation to another Texas liberal with the same surname, U.S. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough of Austin. In the general election of 1968, the heavily favored Smith received 1,662,019 ballots (57 percent) to Eggers' 1,254,333 votes (43 percent). Eggers was considered somewhat moderate for a Texas Republican candidate. He seemed to vacillate on whether to seek the support of disenchanted liberal Democrats who opposed Smith's rather conservative positions or to maintain the active goodwill of the strong conservative base within the Texas GOP. In the end, Eggers lost, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, with the support of retiring U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and John Connally, held Texas, his sole Southern state, in his national loss to Richard M. Nixon. The election of 1970 In 1970, Eggers again ran for the Republican nomination to the Texas governorship, having defeated Roger Martin 101,875 to 7,146 votes. In the general election, he ran against Smith, who won the Democratic nomination without opposition. President Nixon came to East Texas in an attempt to convince conservative Democrats to support the Republican ticket. In Longview, the seat of Gregg County, he formally endorsed both Eggers and U.S. Senate nominee George H.W. Bush, with his greater comments reserved for Bush, then a U.S. Representative from Houston. Nixon declared his endorsement of Eggers: \\"I happen to know him personally and like him ... I appointed him as the General Counsel for the Treasury Department. He rendered distinguished service. And there he learned what it means to handle the great problems involving the finance of the United States of America. He is a man who, in state government, will know how important it is to keep down that spending so that you can keep down your taxes. That is the kind of a man you want in the governor's office in Austin. He is a man who understands the other problems of government, one who will take a firm stand for the enforcement of the law in a fair way; one who will be firm for equality of opportunity for all people, and, above everything else, who will be for progress for this state.\\" Nixon also addressed the use of school busing as a tool to promote desegregation of public schools. Nixon said: \\"If you are going to have quality education for a child, and particularly for a young child, you will have it best by having that child go to school closest to home in his own neighborhood and not some place else. That is why George Bush, John Tower, I, and Paul Eggers all stand firmly for the neighborhood school and against busing, which the law does not require solely for the purpose of racial balance. Because that is quality education.\\" In a low-turnout general election in 1970, Smith received 1,197,726 votes (53.6 percent) to Eggers' 1,037,723 (46.4 percent). In 1970, Eggers registered one of the stronger Republican gubernatorial showings. Eight years earlier, in the 1962 Republican race against then Democrat John Connally, the Houston oilman Jack Cox, a former Democrat, ran nearly as well as Eggers in 1970. Eggers ultimately finished with about the same 46 percent margin as his ticket-mate, George H. W. Bush, who lost to Democratic former U.S. Representative Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., also of Houston. Eggers trailed Bush by 34,000 votes.Texas Secretary of State, Texas election returns, November 1970Despite the defeats of Bush and Eggers, the Republicans won their first countywide race in Dallas County with the election of party stalwart Fred Agnich to the Texas House of Representatives. In 1964, Bush had also fallen short in the U.S. Senate race against Democrat Ralph Yarborough. In the 1970 campaign, Bush defended his support in Congress for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which forbade discrimination in the sale and rental of most housing in the United States. Eggers recalls Bush's admonition to opponents of open housing in that campaign: \\"If you don't want to vote for me because of open housing, then don't vote for me.\\" John Tower in Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir recalled that Lloyd Bentsen \\"moved to the right\\" and cut into Bush's natural base. Eggers, Tower said, \\"was nickeled and dimed to death in the cow counties by Preston Smith, who ran well in the traditionally Democratic rural areas.\\"John G. Tower, Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991, , p. 206-207 In 1969, between his two gubernatorial races, as Nixon had mentioned in Longview, Eggers served briefly in the Treasury Department. Later years In 1976, Eggers led a slate of delegates in Texas's 5th congressional district pledged to U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., but he lost his race and hence his delegate slot, 5,203 to 11,975 to backers of Ford's ultimately unsuccessful intraparty challenger, former Governor Ronald W. Reagan of California. Similarly, Robert Mosbacher in the Houston-based 7th congressional district lost his slot to Reagan backer Walter Mengden, a member of the Texas State Senate.Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96-0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976,\\" West Texas Historical Association Yearbook Vol. 86 (2010), p. 81 In August 1983, Tower flew to Austin on a private plane, with Eggers among his entourage on board, to announce that he would not seek a fifth term in 1984.Tower, Consequences, p. 250 When Tower left office early in 1985, Eggers joined him in the formation of a consulting firm. In 1997, six years after Tower's death, Eggers, then seventy-eight, and three others were charged with defrauding investors in a scheme involving \\"nonexistent bank obligations\\", according to Mary Jo White, then the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The four were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The complaint filed in United States Magistrates Court in Manhattan cited a brochure entitled Secured High-Yield Investment Program, which claimed that a $500,000 investment would bring a return of $10,390,625 within 60 days. The Federal Bureau of Prisons shows no record of Eggers having been imprisoned as a result of the charges filed against him in 1997. From 1987 to 1990, Eggers was named by Republican Governor Bill Clements as chairman of the Governor's Task Force on Drug Abuse. Though he did not seek office after 1970, Eggers supported various Republican candidates over the years, including the unsuccessful campaigns of Thomas Pauken for the U.S. House in Dallas and Howard Callaway for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, both in 1980. Callaway had been President Gerald R. Ford's first campaign manager in 1975. Eggers donated to the pre-general election race of the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1984 and to U.S. Representative Phil Gramm, Tower's successor in the U.S. Senate. In the summer of 1995, Eggers donated to the short-lived presidential bid of then Governor Pete Wilson of California. He also contributed to the Texas Republican Party in Austin. Until his death, Paul and Virginia Eggers resided in Dallas,People Search & Background Check where he had been a member of the Brook Hollow Golf Club. Eggers and his identical twin brother, Arthur Eggers, received the Silver Anniversary All American Award in 1966 from Sports Illustrated magazine in recognition of \\"extraordinary achievement\\" in the twenty-five years since playing their last college football game. He also had a second brother, the Reverend Ernest Eggers, and three sisters.

For the lyrics, he used an allegorical wheel of fortune motif to comment on the unpredictable nature of fame and fortune. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1972, the song was originally released on Clark's Roadmaster, which was only issued in the Netherlands in January 1973. Clark, with his former group the Byrds, re-recorded the song as \\"Full Circle\\" for the 1973 reunion album, Byrds. Original song According to biographer John Einarson, \\"Full Circle Song\\" was written by Clark in early 1972. Critic Matthew Greenwald commented that, although it is hard not to believe that the song is an autobiographical commentary on Clark's own critically lauded, but financially unrewarding solo career, Clark himself always denied that this had been his intention. Clark first recorded the song in April 1972 at Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles, as part of the recording sessions for Clark's second solo album for A&M; Records. For these sessions, Clark and record producer Chris Hinshaw assembled a top flight crew of L.A. studio musicians, including Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Clarence White, Byron Berline, and Spooner Oldham, but progress on the proposed album was slow. The recording sessions were eventually abandoned, due to A&M;'s frustration at the lack of progress, and consequently the album was shelved. Some months later, Clark's friend and former Byrds manager, Jim Dickson, approached Dave Hubert, the head of A&M;'s foreign markets division, regarding a possible European release for the eight tracks completed during the abandoned sessions. Despite protests from some A&M; executives, these tracks were compiled with three other previously unreleased Clark songs and issued in the Netherlands as the Roadmaster album. The Byrds version In late 1972, prior to the Dutch release of Roadmaster, Clark decided to re-record \\"Full Circle Song\\" for inclusion on the Byrds' reunion album, since, at that time, the song was gathering dust in the A&M; tape vaults. During the reunion recording sessions, the song was renamed \\"Full Circle\\" and, for a time, it provided the album's working title. Ultimately, the album would be released with the eponymous title Byrds, as Clark was uncomfortable with his song being used as the title track in case the public mistakenly assumed that it had been written specifically for the reunion. Clark confirmed that this was not the case during a 1979 interview with Byrds' biographer, Johnny Rogan: \\"I'd already recorded that song a couple of years earlier and it wasn't really written about anything specific. It was just an idea I had.\\" The Byrds' recording of the song is similar in feel to the Roadmaster version, with Rogan commenting on the addition of a soaring David Crosby harmony vocal, while Byrds expert Tim Connors described it as \\"a strong country rocker\\" highlighted by mandolin playing from the Byrds' bassist, Chris Hillman. Following the release of the reunion album, \\"Full Circle\\" was issued as a single on April 11, 1973, with \\"Long Live the King\\" as the B-side. The single failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100, but it appeared at number 109 on the magazine's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart; it missed the UK Singles Chart altogether. On August 8, 1975, in the UK the song was re-released as a single, but again, it failed to chart. Cover versions \\"Full Circle\\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Dan Fogelberg, for his 2003 album, Full Circle, and George Elliott, on his Men Don't Smoke album. Joe Algeri has also covered it on his The Stockholm Years album and on the various artists tribute album, Full Circle: A Tribute to Gene Clark. In addition, \\"Full Circle\\" was recorded by Walter Clevenger for the 2007 Byrds' tribute album, Timeless Flyte: A Tribute to the Byrds ‚Äî Full Circle.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The house was first built, not as a manor house, but as a vicarage. It was originally built in the middle of the 17th century. In the early 18th century, when the incumbent was Rev William Langford, it was refaced and partly rebuilt. During the 19th century the building was used as a farmhouse and was known as Manor Farm. The last lord of the manor of Hale was Peter Fleetwood-Hesketh, who was also an architectural historian. In 1947 he moved into the house with his family. Architecture The manor house is built in brown brick with red sandstone dressings. The fa√ßade is symmetrical with two-and-a-half storeys and five bays. Both lateral bays and the central bay are flanked by rusticated Doric pilasters. The central bay contains a door with Corinthian columns on each side. Above the door is a scrolled pediment containing the arms of Rev Langford. The upper storey of the central bay contains a sash window on each side of which are Corinthian pilasters on large brackets. Above the window is another pediment containing carving. The other bays each contain a sash window in both storeys while the top half-storey contains four blind oval windows; all these windows are in moulded stone frames. Across the top of the fa√ßade is a cornice and a balustraded parapet. Behind the fa√ßade the house is two- gabled, the north gable being higher than the south. Internally the entrance hall is panelled with fluted pilasters. There are two staircases, the main one having twisted balusters and the secondary one having flat balusters.

One of Brand's most famous works, it remained in print 70 years after its first publication. It is the story of Harrison Destry's quest for revenge against the 12 jurors whose personal malice leads them to wrongfully convict him of robbery. Plot summary Harrison Destry, a man who thinks he is better than anyone else and is constantly \\"proving\\" it by his skill with a gun, and his ability to win fistfights he provokes, has just lost his horse and his saddle in a card game. (A cowboy who loses his saddle loses the respect of other cowboys.) He has few friends and many enemies (most of whom he created) in his home town of Wham, Texas. But the teenage Charlotte Dangerfield, the daughter of a wealthy rancher, adores him. Only one of the men Destry has beaten in a fight, Chester Bent, seems to bear him no ill-will; Bent stakes the penniless Destry $100. But Bent has just robbed the Express, and (when the wind blows Destry's jacket open) slips cash from the robbery into Destry's pocket. Knowing Destry's character, Bent expects he will waste the money on liquor and gambling, rather than replacing his horse and saddle. This is indeed what happens, and Destry becomes the prime suspect, the planted cash being all but proof of his guilt. Failing to comprehend how much trouble he is in, Destry neglects his defense and is stunned when convicted by a jury stacked with his enemies, who ignore the fact that the robber's description bears no relation whatever to Destry. He is sentenced to 10 years and swears to wreak vengeance on the jurors. Only Charlotte believes Destry is not guilty. Released six years later for good behavior, Destry sets about systematically ruining the jurors' lives. He does not murder any of them, though he kills some in self-defense. Destry explains he is determined to stay within the law from now on (though some of his actions, such as trespassing and safe-cracking, are of dubious legality). His chief concern is to show that none of the \\"jury of his peers\\" is, in fact, his equal. Destry remains ignorant of Bent's role in framing him; Bent is one of the few people who treat Destry kindly, and Destry comes to count Bent as his best friend. But Bent is helping the remaining jurors organize to murder their nemesis. Anticipating a possible showdown with Destry, Bent has improved his shooting and fighting skills to the point where he is better than Destry. While on the run, Destry meets Willie Thornton, a boy who has adopted Destry as his hero, based on the tall tales he has been told. Thornton later secretly observes Bent murdering a creditor. Bent uses Destry's knife to kill his victim, in order to frame Destry again. Bent then spots Willie and chases him; Willie escapes by diving into a raging river, from which he emerges weak and sick. Though running a fever, Willie steals a horse and makes a long, hard ride back to Wham to warn Destry of Bent's treachery. So warned, Destry fights his way out of a trap Bent has laid for him. The story's emotional climax occurs when Destry realizes Willie risked his life to save him and might very well die: > ...he felt a sudden scorn for the baser parts that were in him, the idler, > the scoffer at others, the disdainful mocker at the labors of life. He > wished to be simple, real, quiet, able to command the affection of his > peers. ...for the first time he could realize the meaning of the word > ‚Äúpeer‚Äù. Equal. For all men are equal. Not equal in strength of hand, in > talent, in craft, in speed of foot or in leap of mind, but equal in mystery, > in the identity of the race that breathes through all men, out of the soil, > and out of the heavens. So it was that hatred for his enemies left him. Wham's sheriff, Ding Slater, deputizes Destry, and Destry tries to arrest Bent. But Bent outdraws Destry and shoots Destry's Colt out of his hand; Destry is saved only by Slater's gunfire from the window. Bent flees, with Destry in pursuit. Overtaking Bent, Destry unmounts his enemy, but Bent overpowers Destry and leaps onto Destry's horse, making a last mad dash for freedom. In a most uncharacteristic climax for a Western, Destry shoots Bent in the back as the unarmed man flees. But Destry realizes the shot was lucky and proves nothing about his skill with a gun. Returning to the devoted Charlotte Dangerfield, Destry announces he will lay down his guns forever, acknowledging that he found his peer in Bent.

Brand mentions Lefty Turnbull has been to the Klondike River and back; while Turnbull could theoretically have gone to the Klondike at any time, it is most likely that Turnbull would have participated in the Klondike Gold Rush, marking Destry's release as no earlier than 1897, and probably at least two years later to allow Turnbull adequate time to have gone to Canada and returned. Furthermore, Charlie Dangerfield refers to Mount McKinley in chapter 32. Denali Mountain in Alaska was not referred to as Mount McKinley until 1897, implying the events of the novel, particularly Destry's release, would have taken place around or after 1897. If the T&O; Railroad that bribes Clyde Orrin is the Oklahoma City & Texas Railroad, then that would place Destry's release no later than 1904, the date of the Oklahoma City & Texas's sale to the St. Louis, San Francisco & Texas line. In any event, the absence of references to motor cars or to any man having served in World War I suggests a setting no later than 1916. Publication history Destry Rides Again was first published in 1930, in a series of installments under the title \\"Twelve Peers\\" in Frank Blackwell's Western Story Magazine. It was republished, as a paperback, later that year under the title Destry Rides Again. The word \\"again\\" in the title refers to Destry's renewed freedom to ride after being let out of prison, not to any previous story; this novel was the Destry character's fiction debut. Destry Rides Again was in print continuously from its first publication in 1930 until at least 2000.John Tuska, foreword (2000) to Max Brand, The Bells of San Carlos and Other Stories, University of Nebraska Press, , 9780803261730, p. 1. Adaptations in other media Film Three film versions were made between 1932 and 1954. These owe little to the novel other than their name; the plots are completely unrelated to Brand's story, and Destry's first name is also changed to Tom in the movies. *Destry Rides Again (1932), starring Tom Mix *Destry Rides Again (1939), starring James Stewart *Destry (1954), with Audie Murphy Musical *In 1959, Destry Rides Again was made into a Broadway musical.

It has been bottled continuously since 1871 and is currently owned by Clear Mountain Spring Water Company of Little Rock, Arkansas. Mountain Valley Spring Water is distributed across the United States. History Mountain Valley water originates at a protected spring just west of Highway 7 North, approximately twelve miles from downtown Hot Springs. In 1871, pharmacist Peter E. Greene and his brother, John Greene, were the first to sell Mountain Valley Spring Water, which was then known in the Hot Springs area as ‚ÄúLockett‚Äôs Spring Water‚Äù because of its association with Benjamin Lockett and his son, Enoch. The brothers renamed the water Mountain Valley after a small community nearby. In 1883, the Mountain Valley Water Company was officially formed, with Zeb Ward, G. G. Latta, Samuel Fordyce, and Samuel Stitt House as principal investors and company officers with Peter Greene remaining as local manager. Ownership of the spring was transferred in 1902, when August Schlafly of St. Louis Missouri, already a major stockholder in the company, and his family became sole owners. By 1908, franchise offices had followed in Chicago, Illinois, and New York City. An apocryphal tale holds that two strangers, traveling home to New York from Hot Springs by train, were in the dining car, and each produced a bottle of Mountain Valley for his respective table. This coincidence led to much conversation and then an agreement to form a fifty-fifty partnership for a Mountain Valley Water Company franchise in New York. Upon exchanging business cards, media mogul William Randolph Hearst discovered that his new partner was the well-known gambler Richard Canfield, a man against whom his newspapers were conducting a fierce campaign. By the 1920s, Mountain Valley Water was being served in the United States Senate, and in 1928, distribution began in California, making Mountain Valley the first bottled water to be available coast to coast. In 1924, Schlafly purchased the DeSoto Springs Mineral Water Company, located at 150 Central Avenue in Hot Springs. The two-story, Classical Revival brick building was built specifically to house a mineral water depot. A third level was added in 1921 to house a Japanese-themed dance hall, with accommodation for a live band. The building remained the DeSoto Spring Water Depot and DeSoto Dance Hall until 1936, when Mountain Valley Water Company made the building its national headquarters and visitor center. In 1966, the Schlaflys sold the company to a group of distributors under the leadership of John G. Scott. The company‚Äôs headquarters were moved to Paramus, New Jersey, and the historic Mountain Valley building was closed. In April 1987, Sammons Enterprises of Dallas, Texas, purchased the company and returned administrative operations to Hot Springs. Sammons sold the company in April 2004 to the current private ownership. New York based CO OP Brand Co, illustrator Two Arms Inc, and Colorado based Land Design collaborated to create the new image and branding for the company in 2016 Health benefits In an effort to discover what ingredient or ingredients made this spring water different from its competitors and beneficial to those with chronic disorders, the company encouraged the clinical and biochemical study of the water and its possible therapeutic effects in the 1920s and 1930s. Clinical tests at hospitals in New York, St. Louis, and Philadelphia demonstrated improvements in the health of patients suffering from kidney and liver disorders and rheumatism as a result of drinking Mountain Valley Water. Studies after World War II in facilities in New York, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, and Houston further investigated the connection between the low-sodium content of the water and its alkaline buffering ability. The extensive testing of the spring water enabled the company to present a strong and successful defense to 1956 allegations by the Food and Drug Administration that its advertising claims were too broad and exaggerated. Awards In 2003, it received a Gold Medal at the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting Awards for Non-Carbonated Bottled Water. Water varieties include regular spring water and sparkling water, and both varieties are available in glass bottles or plastic bottles that use 25% recycled PET. In 2011, Mountain Valley Sparkling Water won the Silver Medal in the sparkling water category at the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting Awards. Notable connoisseurs Every United States President from Calvin Coolidge to Bill Clinton served Mountain Valley Spring Water in the White House. Following a heart attack in 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower drank the water on the advice of his physician. Other notable connoisseurs of the water included Elvis Presley and boxing champions Joe Louis, Gene Tunney, and Sugar Ray Robinson. Consumption of the water has not been limited to humans: thoroughbreds such as Secretariat, Nashua, Kelso, Bold Ruler, and Sunday Silence were trained on this spring water. P. Allen Smith serves Mountain Valley Spring and Sparkling Water at his garden home. Mountain Valley Spring and Sparkling Waters are the official bottled waters of the Southern Foodways Alliance and the Society of Hickory Golfers. Legal and environmental issues Because of the environmental impact of bottled water and the lack of any proven benefits of it compared to municipal tap water, states are increasingly banning its purchase using state funds. While of course individuals are free to purchase it, states like NY will not allow state money to be used to purchase it for any State events of at state-funded institutions. California and Massachusetts have similar laws preventing the use of taxpayer funds on these products. In popular culture Mountain Valley Spring Water has a long show business tradition that dates back to Gloria Swanson. Mountain Valley Spring Water was featured on screen in the convenience store in John Carpenter‚Äôs The Fog. Today Mountain Valley shares the screen with stars such as Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Paul Reiser, and Ashley Judd. On television, Mountain Valley has been featured in episodes of Parks and Recreation and Happily Divorced.

The library regularly contributes unique digitized public domain from their collections to the Internet Archive. History From 1862 to 1893 the library was located in the west wing of the Arts Building (Molson Hall), where the collection slowly expanded. In 1893 the Redpath Library opened in what is now Redpath Hall. At the same time, the first full-time University Librarian, Charles H. Gould (1893-1919) was appointed. Under Gould and Gerhard Lomer (1920-1947) both the collection and staff expanded. By the 1920s and 1930s the central library's lack of space meant that there was more departmental and area libraries being established. In 1952 a large addition to Redpath Hall was opened to the south and the east wall of the original building was enclosed. It was at this time the library reading room was moved over what is now known at the Redpath library building and the Hall became a music hall. It was during this time that the University Librarian became primarily responsible for this main library collection that covered the humanities and social sciences discipline. Area libraries in Medicine, Law, Engineering, Physical Sciences, Divinity, Nursing and other disciplines were still largely independent. In 1969, McLennan Library (Humanities and Social Sciences) opened, and Senate set up a University Libraries Commission whose Report (1971) recommended reorganization and greater coordination in the administration of the library systems.

The Torreya Formation is a Miocene geologic formation with an outcrop in North Florida. It is within the Hawthorn Group. Age Period: Neogene Epoch: Early Miocene Faunal stage: Aquitanian through early Messinian ~19‚Äì15.3 mya, calculates to a period of Composition The Torreya Formation is exposed or near the surface from Gadsden County, Florida on the west. Its eastern extent is westernmost Hamilton County, Florida. It includes the counties of Liberty, Leon, Jefferson, Madison, and Wakulla. It is informally subdivided into a lower carbonate unit and an upper siliciclastic unit. The majority of Torreya Formation outcrops expose the siliciclastic part of the unit.United States Geological Survey: Hawthorne Group: Torreya Formation Lithology The siliciclastics are quartz and vary in color from white to light olive gray. They are unconsolidated to poorly indurated (hard), slightly clayey sands with minor phosphate to light gray to bluish gray, poorly consolidated, variably silty clay (Dogtown Member). The siliciclastics are sporadically fossiliferous and often contain oyster shells as found in the Seaboard Air Line Railroad site. The carbonate sediments contain phosphate and are white to light olive gray. They are generally not hard but variably sandy with clay. This unit is also fossiliferous with both molds and casts and includes limestone (mudstone and wackestone). The limestones often grade into calcareous-cemented sands. The Dogtown Member is time transgressive with older aged material at ~15.9‚Äì15.3 Ma. and found in the south while the younger material is in the north.Improved chronologic resolution of the Hawthorn and the Alum Bluff Groups in northern Florida: Implications for Miocene chronostratigraphy by J.

Originally named Mount Whitney she was sold to new German owners in 1924 and renamed Margaret Sayer, finally in 1925 she was acquired by Flensburg owners and renamed 'Paul'. Shipwreck and salvage The wreck of the SV Paul in 2018 In 1925 the Paul crossed the Atlantic from Cadiz to St. John, Newfoundland and loaded 2,000 tons of timber at Halifax for Dublin. On 30 October she ran into severe gales, losing many sails and her anchors; eventually grounding on the Cefn Sidan sands as without any auxiliary motive power she was unable to make an escape. On this occasion she had a crew of twelve, with a cook, the master and a teenage stewardess Another reference cites her grounding as being on November 5, 1925. Several tugs came up from Cardiff and failed in an attempt to refloat her. A salvage company took on 26 local men and salvaged the timber cargo. Most of the timber was made into rafts and floated over to the nearby railway line at Bertwn. Archaeology Pembrey's Cefn Sidan sands translates as 'silken back', describing the smooth flat stretch of over 7 miles of sand and the Paul is the largest remaining timber wreck to be seen on the Cefn Sidan sands of the 182 vessels are recorded as being wrecked here. The unloaded hulk has shifted position and coastline alterations mean that she now lies within the Gwendraeth estuary. The construction being massive, and the site being protected from the worst of the storms has meant that the wreck has only slowly broken up. The substantial timbers held together by innumerable wrought-iron fastenings are still apparent. Much has been stripped from the wreck over the years and bullet holes indicate its use as a target before the establishment of the holiday camp. Local history Part of the Cefn Sidan sands Significant quantities of the Paul's cargo are said to have ended up in the hands of locals. Long prior to the Paul's loss, locals had become known as the 'Gwyr-y-bwelli-bach' (literally hatchet men), because in local legend they were accused of displaying lights to confuse and then attract shipping onto the sands. A so- called 'Wrecker's' window survives in Bryn Towi cottage on the lane running up to Tanylan Farm from the Gwendraeth and the old farm of Tanylan Isaf (previously Danylan) nearby has beams made from ship's timbers.Griffith, Roger (2009). Oral information. The aforementioned hatchets of the gwyr-y-bwelli- bach were said used to have been used to cut off swollen fingers of casualties bearing gold rings, etc. Fifty arrests are known to have been made of locals plundering wrecked vessels over the years and at least thirty mariners are unfortunate enough to have perished on the sands of the Cefn Sidan area. According to local accounts, an attempt to salvage the entire ship failed. The ship was filled below deck with barrels, hoping that the extra buoyancy would raise the ship at high tide. Unfortunately, all this achieved was the decking gave way under the force, ruining most of the integrity of the ship and making it practically impossible to salvage whole. Part of the wreck is still there to this day (as of 2019).

It was further manifested from 1850 under the new name Winterhalder & Hofmeier. In 1869 the company was renamed M. Winterhalder & Hofmeier, Friedenweiler und Schwaerzenbach, in Neustadt. From 1908 the new name was M. Winterhalder & Hofmeier GmbH. The company was part of the Black Forest clockmaker industry as its factory was located in Titisee-Neustadt and surroundings and as it subscribed to high quality standards. The company existed until 1933. It is regarded as one of the finest Victorian clockmakers of the time.  Origins of the company  Engraved initial letters on back of Winterhalder & Hofmeier clocks from Schwaerzenbach, Black Forest, Germany The firm Winterhalder Uhrenfabrik was established in 1810 by Thomas Winterhalder. Even his grandfather Nikolaus Winterhalder (1710-1743) made quality Black Forest clocks with wooden cogs and weights from stones.(de) Winterhalder & Hofmeier on web site Uhrmacherwerkstatt.com. Thomas moved in 1816 with his three sons Matth√§us, Karl und Thomas to Friedenweiler where he lived in an old house (\\"Altes Haus\\") which he had bought from a monastery. Matth√§us Winterhalder (1799‚Äì1863) took over the work rooms in 1830. In 1850 his relative Johannes Hofmeier (1802-1876) from Schwaerzenbach, which is nowadays a part of Titisee-Neustadt joined and they formed the company Winterhalder & Hofmeier. Clocks were marked from there on with the initials W & H Sch.  Company in expansion  The next generation, i. e. Anton, Karl, Thomas und Johannes, changed firm name and responsibility in 1869 (\\"oHG\\"). The third generation formed on December 19, 1908 a company of limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung). All partners of that company were brothers or cousins to each other. They delivered parts from their own separate firms to the common Winterhalder & Hofmeier company. At that time the firm had (including homeworkers) about 800 employees and a turnover of one million Mark.  Decline of the company in World War I  Orders from the United Kingdom declined just before World War I. War was anticipated by his customers, so Linus Winterhalder agreed in the UK in London with his customers to grant a delay of payments from one month to three months. Orders then came in, but he did not receive any more payments after World War I began. The company was in financial danger. During the First World War production had to change to war material, especially ignitors for shells.Hitzschlag in London. In: R√ºdiger Gramsch: Wo die Stunde schl√§gt. Mit Hansy Vogt unterwegs auf der Deutschen Uhrenstra√üe. Silberburg Verlag GmbH, T√ºbingen 2017. . P. 95‚Äì103.  Insolvency in Nazi Germany  After First World War former export markets were no longer in need for Winterhalder precision clocks because of import duties, Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, Great Depression and competing mass products. Linus Winterhalder tried in August 1932 to revive exports of his clocks to the United Kingdom, but died in London on August 18, 1932 by a heat stroke and heart attack. After his death the company Winterhalder & Hofmeier had to stop production in 1933 due to lack of liquidity. The buildings of the company were set under economic control. In 1937 the buildings of the company were sold in a compulsory auction in 1937 and came to the city of Neustadt.Hitzschlag in London. In: R√ºdiger Gramsch: Wo die Stunde schl√§gt.

On the current cadastral graphic matrix however, the border line is drawn along the southern border to the street, suggesting that it is entirely located within Canada. At the west end of Canusa is the Beebe Plain‚ÄìBeebe Border Crossing. Immediately facing them is a solid granite line house. This building (built as a store in the 1820s) was for a time the world's only international post office. It had one postmaster, but two doors and two postal counters, each serving customers from a different country.

The DC music scene from the 1970s through today enjoys a professional level of quality that many such studios offer locally. Technology at Cue and other studios has evolved from vintage tape equipment to modern digital recording systems such as Pro Tools. Throughout its 30 years producing recordings for bands, solo artists, politicians, and cable documentaries, it has seen advancements in recording technology and a degradation in industry sound requirements such as the advent of compressed digital files, i.e. mpegs, CDs, etc. Founded by Jeff Jeffrey in 1982, Cue began recording bands and commercial narrations in a basement studio located in Falls Church, VA. In 1987, Jeffrey leased 3500 square feet of space in a commercial building where the next phase Cue began. Today, this building still continues to be Cue's home with the expansion to 5500 square feet, housing six of its studios. Cue has achieved many accomplishments since its inception. It has been awarded 10 gold and platinum awards for tracking and mixing major label recordings, received three Wammies for Best Studio in the DC area, an Innovative Technology award from Falls Church City, a mid Atlantic Best Studio award from Music Monthly Magazine, and contributed to several Grammy awarded recordings. Cue created its sister enterprise in 2001, Cue Studios Center for Audio Engineering.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  History  Fred Smith was born in 1835 in Baden, Germany, and emigrated to the United States when he was twenty, settling in the Keweenaw Peninsula. Smith worked for various mining and mercantile corporations, until in 1876 he joined the Allouez Mining Company, first as a clerk and then, in 1877, as mining captain. Smith worked in the Allouez mine until 1892, when it suspended operations; he then joined the Wolverine Copper Mining Company as superintendent. The Wolverine Mine had been established in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula in 1882, but was \\"indifferently operated\\" until a reorganization in 1890 and Smith's subsequent stewardship. In 1898, John Stanton established the Mohawk Mining Company five miles north of the Wolverine, and simultaneously gained control of the Wolverine Mine. Stanton was born in Bristol, England, in 1830. His family emigrated to the United States in 1835, where his father worked in and eventually owned coal and iron mines in Pennsylvania. John Stanton began his career as an engineer in his father's iron mines, but he moved to other iron and copper mines in Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia. Stanton eventually came to the Keweenaw Peninsula, working first at the Central Mine and at the Atlantic Mine before establishing the Mohawk. Stanton assigned Fred Smith to supervise the Mohawk in addition to his supervision of the Wolverine. By the early 1900s, the Wolverine Mine employed 350 men and the Mohawk 450 men. In 1899-1900, the Wolverine Copper Mining Company had this house built for Fred Smith and his family at a cost of nearly $12,000. Smith occupied the house until his retirement in 1913, after which Theodore Dengler, the new superintendent of the Wolverine and Mohawk Mines, moved in. Dengler had been an employee of Stanton's since 1893, working at the Atlantic Mine and the Baltic Mine first as an engineer and, starting in 1907, as superintendent of the Atlantic. The mines closed in 1932, after which Dengler bought the house, reportedly for $22.50. Dengler reportedly committed suicide in the carriage house in 1940.  Description and significance  The Smith‚ÄìDengler House is a large Queen Anne‚Äìstyle mansion sided with clapboard on the first floor and wooden shingles above. It has an L-shaped plan and sits on a sandstone foundation. The house boasts multiple porches, bay windows, and an irregular roofline with multiple dormers. The house is significant as an unchanged example of a large house built for the elite mine agents and superintendents during the boom copper-mining years in the 1890s and early 1900s. The house is also an excellent example of residential architectural work of the firm of Charlton, Gilbert & Demar.

It does this by representing data as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The procedure thus appears to be the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data. MCA can be viewed as an extension of simple correspondence analysis (CA) in that it is applicable to a large set of categorical variables. As an extension of correspondence analysis MCA is performed by applying the CA algorithm to either an indicator matrix (also called complete disjunctive table ‚Äì CDT) or a Burt table formed from these variables. An indicator matrix is an individuals √ó variables matrix, where the rows represent individuals and the columns are dummy variables representing categories of the variables.Le Roux, B. and H. Rouanet (2004), Geometric Data Analysis, From Correspondence Analysis to Structured Data Analysis, Dordrecht. Kluwer: p.179 Analyzing the indicator matrix allows the direct representation of individuals as points in geometric space. The Burt table is the symmetric matrix of all two-way cross-tabulations between the categorical variables, and has an analogy to the covariance matrix of continuous variables. Analyzing the Burt table is a more natural generalization of simple correspondence analysis, and individuals or the means of groups of individuals can be added as supplementary points to the graphical display. In the indicator matrix approach, associations between variables are uncovered by calculating the chi-square distance between different categories of the variables and between the individuals (or respondents). These associations are then represented graphically as \\"maps\\", which eases the interpretation of the structures in the data. Oppositions between rows and columns are then maximized, in order to uncover the underlying dimensions best able to describe the central oppositions in the data. As in factor analysis or principal component analysis, the first axis is the most important dimension, the second axis the second most important, and so on, in terms of the amount of variance accounted for. The number of axes to be retained for analysis is determined by calculating modified eigenvalues. Recent works and extensions In recent years, several students of Jean-Paul Benz√©cri have refined MCA and incorporated it into a more general framework of data analysis known as geometric data analysis. This involves the development of direct connections between simple correspondence analysis, principal component analysis and MCA with a form of cluster analysis known as Euclidean classification. Two extensions have great practical use. * It is possible to include, as active elements in the MCA, several quantitative variables. This extension is called factor analysis of mixed data (see below). * Very often, in questionnaires, the questions are structured in several issues. In the statistical analysis it is necessary to take into account this structure. This is the aim of multiple factor analysis which balances the different issues (i.e. the different groups of variables) within a global analysis and provides, beyond the classical results of factorial analysis (mainly graphics of individuals and of categories), several results (indicators and graphics) specific of the group structure. Application fields In the social sciences, MCA is arguably best known for its application by Pierre Bourdieu,Scott, John & Gordon Marshall (2009): Oxford Dictionary of Sociology, p. 135. Oxford: Oxford University Press notably in his books La Distinction, Homo Academicus and The State Nobility. Bourdieu argued that there was an internal link between his vision of the social as spatial and relational --‚Äì captured by the notion of field, and the geometric properties of MCA.Rouanet, Henry (2000) \\"The Geometric Analysis of Questionnaires. The Lesson of Bourdieu's La Distinction\\", in Bulletin de M√©thodologie Sociologique 65, pp. 4‚Äì18 Sociologists following Bourdieu's work most often opt for the analysis of the indicator matrix, rather than the Burt table, largely because of the central importance accorded to the analysis of the 'cloud of individuals'.Lebaron, Fr√©d√©ric (2009) \\"How Bourdieu ‚ÄúQuantified‚Äù Bourdieu: The Geometric Modelling of Data\\", in Robson and Sanders (eds.) Quantifying Theory: Pierre Bourdieu. Springer, pp. 11-30. Multiple correspondence analysis and principal component analysis MCA can also be viewed as a PCA applied to the complete disjunctive table. To do this, the CDT must be transformed as follows. Let y_{ik} denote the general term of the CDT. y_{ik} is equal to 1 if individual i possesses the category k and 0 if not. Let denote p_k, the proportion of individuals possessing the category k. The transformed CDT (TCDT) has as general term: x_{ik}=y_{ik}/p_k - 1 The unstandardized PCA applied to TCDT, the column k having the weight p_k, leads to the results of MCA. This equivalence is fully explained in a book by J√©r√¥me Pag√®s.Pag√®s J√©r√¥me (2014). Multiple Factor Analysis by Example Using R. Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series London 272 p It plays an important theoretical role because it opens the way to the simultaneous treatment of quantitative and qualitative variables. Two methods simultaneously analyze these two types of variables: factor analysis of mixed data and, when the active variables are partitioned in several groups: multiple factor analysis. This equivalence does not mean that MCA is a particular case of PCA as it is not a particular case of CA. Its only means that these methods are closely linked one another as they belong to the same family: the factorial methods. Software There are numerous software of data analysis that include MCA, such as STATA and SPSS. The R package FactoMineR also features MCA. This software is related to a book describing the basic methods for performing MCA .Husson F., L√™ S. & Pag√®s J. (2009). Exploratory Multivariate Analysis by Example Using R.

They are also known for hosting the Tritonia radio show, broadcasting on Sirius XM BPM channel 51. Biography Formed in 2008, Tritonal, the Texas-based production and DJ duo consisting of Chad Cisneros and Dave Reed, are #65 on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs of 2012 and one of MTV Clubland's \\"10 Artists to Watch in 2013\\". In their early years, they often collaborated with Austin-based vocalist Cristina Soto on their vocal tracks. They also hosted a trance radio show known as Air Up There. In 2008, their track \\"Lights Over Austin\\" was featured on the Anjunabeats Volume Six compilation by Above & Beyond. In 2010, Tritonal formed the now-defunct trance sub label Air Up There Recordings (named after their former radio show) under Enhanced Music. The first release was Hands to Hold Me by the duo with Cristina Soto. Their 2011 debut artist album Piercing the Quiet produced eight top 20 Beatport singles, including five that held the #1 position on the trance chart for over three weeks. In September 2012, they released the remix album Piercing the Quiet Remixed, which landed in the top 5 on the iTunes dance albums chart. After 100 episodes of their radio show Air Up There, they ended it with a sold out, live performance in their hometown of Austin, Texas. A new program called Tritonia aired on Sirius XM Electric Area, but now broadcasts Monday and Wednesday evenings from 11pm to midnight EST on Sirius XM BPM channel 51. In 2013, Tritonal switched their style from trance to house, which was reflected in their 2013 and 2014 EP series entitled Metamorphic. The first EP, Metamorphic I, was released on March 25, with remixes of their track \\"Bullet That Saved Me\\" featuring Underdown released in April 2013. Also on April 16, 2013, Tritonal announced via social media that they would be joining Will Holland as co-owners and directors of Enhanced Music. Their sub label Air Up There Recordings had its last release on September 9, 2013. As of January 2018, Tritonal have produced over 200 original productions and remixes and have been supported by other DJs like Armin van Buuren, Above & Beyond, Ti√´sto, Steve Aoki, Nicky Romero, Cash Cash, Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz and more. In 2013, they played festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival, Escape From Wonderland, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Zoo Festival, and Creamfields Australia. In Summer 2013, Tritonal embarked on a major, 40+ city tour throughout North America. In 2015, their song \\"Untouchable\\" with Cash Cash made Billboard's Year-End Top 100 for Dance/Electronic songs. In 2016, they released their sophomore artist album Painting with Dreams.

It is formally founded in 1975 by Ven. Dongchu, a scholar monk and disciple of renowned Chinese Buddhist Master Taixu. It's named ' Farming Ch'an ' as its early residents dedicated themselves to Ch'an practice and grew their own food. Its spirit is based on 8th century Zen Master Baizhang Huaihai's aphorism, \\"A day without work is a day without food.\\" Ven. Dongchu bought the land at Guandu Plain near Taipei in the end of the 1960s. As he didn't have many followers, he worked most of the land by himself and for the first few years, his only improvement is to have the land leveled. It then became a farmland worked by Ven. Dong Chu, his two disciples, and the neighboring villagers. In 1971, Ven. Dongchu finally began to build a two-story farmhouse that still existed today behind the main hall. The building was completed four years later in 1975.http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000016&ccid;=C_00000018 Ven. Dongchu was determined to promote Buddhist culture in Taiwan and cultivating Buddhist human talent. The monastery became a center for Ven. Dongchu's cultural and educational activity, and annual winter charity events.http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000042 In 1978, Ven. Dongchu died and in his will he wanted to be succeeded by his disciple, Ven. Sheng-yen, as the abbot of the monastery. Ven. Sheng-yen was in United States by the time, he was just being elected abbot of a small monastery in Bronx, New York called Temple of Great Enlightenment. But he couldn't refuse his master's will and decided to return to Taiwan.Sheng Yen, Footprints in the Snow: The Autobiography of a Chinese Buddhist Monk. Doubleday Religion, 2008. . Under Ven. Sheng-yen's leadership the monastery's devotees increased, and it had to expand its buildings further. The two-story farmhouse wasn't enough for the growing followers. Under the help of some donors, it then erected several temporary steel buildings. Some of Ven. Sheng-yen's earliest Taiwanese disciples were devotees and monks in Nung Chan. Throughout the 1980s it continued to expand with temporary buildings as Master Sheng-yen's reputation grew. Its capacity became quite overwhelmed by the late 1980s and finally the organization decided to buy a new plot of land in the mountainous area of Jinshan, Taipei and build the Dharma Drum Mountain (DDM). Until today, after the completion of DDM in Jinshan, Nung Chan continues to serve as DDM's principal branch. Gallery File:ncwall.jpg File:Nung Chan Monastery 115.jpg File:Ncroom.jpg See also * Ven.

Shivaji  He first met Shivaji when the latter visited Agra to meet the emperor Aurangzeb; thereafter, Bhushan was supported by Shivaji Maharaj . Bhushan later moved from Varanasi to Maratha Kingdom in the 1670s, and attended Shivaji's durbar (court). Bhushan presented many of his poems on the occasion of the grand coronation of Shivaji Maharaj .

At 10pm on that day, 15-year-old Irish girl Amy Fitzpatrick said goodbye to her friend Ashley Rose, with whom she had been babysitting Ashley's brother at a house in Mijas Costa in M√°laga, Spain. Fitzpatrick should have arrived at her home a few minutes later, as it was only a short walk away. She never arrived home and has not been heard from or seen since that night. Initial search Following her disappearance, a search involving hundreds of people was launched amidst speculation this was not an abduction. In August 2008, the home of Mahon and Fitzpatrick's lawyer in Riviera del Sol was broken into and a laptop that was used in the search for Fitzpatrick was stolen. In addition, Fitzpatrick's Nokia mobile phone was stolen. The 32-year-old lawyer, Juan Jos√© de la Fuente Teixid√≥, said the burglars got into his property by forcing a locked garden gate. He said: \\"The stolen documents included confidential police reports about Fitzpatrick's disappearance. I believe the burglary was related to Fitzpatrick's disappearance. It makes no sense that they took documents which financially are worthless, and left behind all my expensive valuables like TVs, computers and music equipment.\\" Ransom demand In June 2009, Audrey Fitzpatrick received a telephone call from a man claiming he knew the location of Amy Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick described the caller as having an African accent asking her if she was Fitzpatrick's mother. In an article published by expatriate newspaper Euro Weekly News Audrey said: > He went on to say he knew where she was. She had been kidnapped and was in > Madrid and the police were not to be involved. So I agreed, of course. He > then said he'd ring me back with a name and address in two hours. Five hours > later, after sitting with my phone in my hand and my heart in my mouth, I > got a text to say, and I quote: 'Can you pay us 500,000 euro.

Audrey Fitzpatrick commented that the Guardia Civil and her private investigators followed up on these numbers, but they were both pre-pay, and had never been registered. Later investigations Audrey Fitzpatrick has taken on private investigators who have been working on Fitzpatrick's case since 2008. They are the same detectives who investigated the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. In May 2012, it was reported that an Irish gangland killer, Eric \\"Lucky\\" Wilson, murdered her.Is gangland killer Lucky linked to missing Amy? Evening Herald, 1 May 2012 Her parents believe that this particular piece of information is credible; however, a body is yet to be found. Amy was seen out with an older man on the night she disappeared who her family now believe was Wilson. A police report from May 2011, claims three witnesses have come forward alleging they saw Amy with a mystery blonde woman in the Trafalgar Bar in Calahonda's El Zoco centre hours after her previous last reported sighting. Amy's 23-year-old brother Dean Fitzpatrick was stabbed to death in Coolock, Dublin, in 2013 in an incident involving Dave Mahon, his mother's partner. On 6 May 2016, Dave Mahon was found not guilty of murder but guilty of the manslaughter of his stepson, Dean Fitzpatrick. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison.

Admissions It has around 1,000 pupils from the Penyrheol, Gorseinon, and Loughor areas. It is situated just east of the B4296, accessed via two miles along the A4240 from junction 47 of the M4. It does not have a sixth form. It serves Gorseinon, Loughor, Penyrheol, Kingsbridge and Garden Village. History It was formerly administered by West Glamorgan County Council (based in Swansea). 1976 fire The school had to be rebuilt due to a fire in 1976 which destroyed half of the school. Thirty years later, much the same thing would happen again and a similar financial shortfall in the cost from what was available from insurance cover.  2006 fire  On Saturday 18 March 2006 from around 2 - 6am the school was largely destroyed by arson when the school was largely engulfed in a blaze. Strong winds added to the fire. The whole main building was destroyed leaving only the drama studio, sports hall, and annex which contained the English and Welsh departments as well as one ICT room. Much course work was lost in the blaze. 40 classrooms were destroyed. Only the English and Maths departments survived. 60 firefighters fought the blaze for four hours. Water from the pool in the leisure centre was used to fight the fire. Many teachers lost valuable work that was irreplaceable. Artwork was completely destroyed. On 30 November 2006, 18-year-old Jonathan Giles, was sentenced to six years for starting the fire, having been arrested on 19 March 2006. He denied the charge of burglary. It was started in a bag of paper meant for recycling. On leaving the building they took some fire extinguishers which they used to spray some local girls. Not all of Swansea Council's insurance covered the fire damage. New building The school now has a new ¬£9.9 million building which was opened 4 September 2009, Designed by Stride Treglown and built by Carillion, and includes a sprinkler system and more CCTV. This new building now contains all the specialist teaching facilities. At the time of the blaze, the headteacher 'Alan Tootill' admitted that they would not have had a new school building had the school not been burned to the ground.

Mission  The mission of Educators Rising is to foster the recruitment and development of prospective educators worldwide through the dissemination of innovative programming and relevant research.  Vision  By elevating the image of teaching, Educators Rising will attract dynamic and diverse students who will become tomorrow's great educators.  History and governance  During the first half of the last century, the National Education Association initiated a Future Teachers of America program. Similar efforts were also made by various state departments of education, many local schools, and, most notably, by Jan Towslee. As president of the Association of Teacher Educators, Towslee made the development of the Future Educators of America a priority. In 1994, Phi Delta Kappa International took the lead on FEA and provided it with an international headquarters. In 2005, PDK changed the name to Future Educators Association to more accurately reflect the international nature of the organization. In 2015, FEA changed its name to Educators Rising, defined as one of seven divisions of PDK International, in this incarnation it set pre-service standards, built curriculum, and created tools to advance the education profession at an earlier age. Currently, Educators Rising is governed by the PDK International Board, which is composed of thirteen individuals elected by PDK's professional membership.

According to the Urban Institute, BCI is classified as an \\"International Relief\\" organization. BCI have built and operate the BCI Academy, the Adana Children Center, and they support orphaned and impoverished children through a foster care program. In addition, BCI hosts mission teams to Ethiopia throughout the year. BCI partners with several ministries, individuals, and organizations to effect its work in Ethiopia. Their strategy is to work through and equip local churches in Ethiopia to carry out the work of the ministry. At the time of this writing, BCI is partnering with 5 local churches in Debre Zeyit, Ethiopia. Working with Ethiopian church leaders and staff, the neediest orphaned and impoverished children are accepted into the Adana Children program and placed in homes with loving families. BCI raises support through donations, copy writing, print work, teams, and a child sponsorship program. History Blessing the Children International was founded by Keith V. Strawn in 2001 as a means to carry out his vision of helping impoverished children in foreign countries. Shortly after creation, BCI joined a partner ministry in El Salvador to improve donor communications through regular mailings and by publishing a regular newsletters. In 2002, BCI began partnered with the Blair Foundation to administrate their church planting in Ethiopia. BCI was responsible for developing and managing all aspects of the program, including a report collection system to keep sponsors informed of their sponsored missionary's progress. In January 2004, BCI launched the Ethiopian Call Ministry through a partner ministry, planting 1,000 new churches in the remote villages of Ethiopia over the next two years. Previously, only seven churches existed in the entire region of almost 1 million people. BCI fully administrated all aspects of the program; missionary deployment, tracking, and data collection for communications to more than 1,500 donors. The goal was achieved and the one thousandth church was planted September 15, 2006. In January 2006, BCI launched the Kamashi Orphanage & School in a remote area of Benishangul Gumuz, Ethiopia, at the request of President Yaregal Ashishem.The Christian Post The Kamashi Orphanage is a 500-bed facility built by the government in 2003, and sat empty for three years due to the government having no operational budget. The orphanage was given to BCI free of charge and they received the first 38 children in January, 2006. By November 2006, the number of children accepted had risen to 141. In April 2006, The first team visited the Kamashi Orphanage & School. BCI began recruiting and hosting mission trips to Ethiopia. In August 2006, BCI launched a short-term missionary program, whereby volunteers from America and aboard are able to serve longterm in Ethiopia. In the same month, the first two short-term missionaries arrived. Missionaries followed, teaching and caring for children to \\"Make a difference in the world\\", according to the University of South Carolina Upstate.University of South Carolina Upstate In October 2007, BCI announcedHope on the Horizon plans to start a ministry in the Debre Zeyit area of Ethiopia. The Adana Children Center is a school, community center, and foster care program. The word 'Adana' means 'Rescue' in Amharic. In January 2008, BCI launched the new program in Debre Zeyit, whereby over the next five years, 600 orphaned children are planned to be rescued and provided wholesome families to care for them as their own children. In November 2008, BCI broke ground for the construction of the BCI Academy (school) & Adana Children Center (community center) in Debre Zeyit, Ethiopia. Along with serving the community, this center will also house the BCI Academy, opening with grades 1st through 4th, the school will eventually offer grades K-12. In September 2009, BCI announced the completion of phase one construction and the opening of the BCI Academy to 83 students in grades 1st through 4th.Free Christian Press - article In October 2009, the BCI Academy began construction of Phase Two, adding 6 additional classrooms. Current work During BCI's first few years, BCI principally focused on partnering with like-minded ministries to increase their effectiveness and assist them in program development and implementation. Working with over 30 nonprofit organizations in America, Central America, and Africa to help them measure, document, and communicate the results of their ministries to their donors. Currently, BCI continues consulting, copy writing and print work for like- minded ministries, but also has direct project in Ethiopia, Africa. The Ethiopian ministry consists of 3 primary venues; BCI Academy & Adana Children Center, a Child Sponsorship program, and Teams & Missionaries. All three of these activities focus around the Adana Children Center, their current project. BCI Academy & Adana Children Center The Adana Children Center is a compound built by Blessing the Children International in Debre Zeyit, Ethiopia (phase one of four finished, scheduled to be completed by 2012). The compound will consist of a community center, a private school, and a housing area and is being built on 5,000 square meters of land provided by the Ethiopian government. According to the published construction plan & budget, the entire compound is to be built in four phases and will cost $243,205 USD to build. One of the schools that BCI uses to educate the children the BCI Academy, initially called the \\"American Academy of Excellence\\", located in the Adana Children Center. When completed, it will seat 350 students at 27 students per classroom. The Academy is being built to supply the need of quality education in Debre Zeyit and the surrounding area. As a private school being operated at first-world standards, English will be the principle medium of instruction in all classes instead of the native language of the region, Amharic. As a result, there will be much more advanced educational curriculum available to them than to schools teaching in Amharic. The compound, when not being used for school, in the afternoons and evenings, will be available for community service programs, focusing on the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of both children and adults in the community. At completion, the Adana Children Center will have housing and kitchen facilities, providing living quarters for up to 24 people. These accommodations are available to children in special circumstances, short- and long-term missionaries, foreign teachers, and teams serving BCI. This facility is not intended to be an orphanage or permanent residency for children, since BCI prefers children be raised in a family within their community, where they would receive more individual attention. Child Sponsorship Program Blessing the Children provides relief and support to children through child sponsorships. Individual and corporate sponsors can support specific children with a $30/month sponsorship or for those desiring to be a child's only sponsor, some choose to fully sponsor a child with $90/month. Sponsorships provide all of the services and support that the child needs, including full tuition, shoes and clothes, medical care, food, shelter, and vocational training for both the child and the foster family. The need for sponsorship is clearest to those who experience the need first-hand, as teams returning frequently sponsor children.The Woodstock Independent - article Dissimilar to other non-profit organisations, BCI pay no overhead expenses from donations for sponsorships or projects. Generally, non-profit ministries spend an average of 20% or more of their revenues on overhead expenses. Blessing the Children also has overhead expenses, but they are paid from revenues generated by BCI's printing and other services to other ministries. Therefore, no portion of donations for sponsorships or projects is spent on overhead. Teams & Missionaries Blessing the Children hosts 10 prescheduled trips to Ethiopia each year, open to individuals from anywhere in the world. These trips are frequently life changing experiences. A Baltimore Ravens Cheerleader says after returning from her trip, ‚ÄúYou hear about the poverty situation in Africa through [sporadic] media coverage, however, no news story on the subject will ever truly depict the brutality and reality that these people are faced with day in and day out, struggling to survive.‚Äù Scheduled trips are 2 weeks long, but missionaries can extend their stay as long as desired. Additionally, BCI hosts custom teams for churches, schools, and other organizations. As a full-service ministry, BCI handles the entire planning process for teams and missionaries; meals, lodging, translators, guides, taxes, tips, airport pickup in Ethiopia, local transport in Ethiopia, and airfare booking & ticketing. They are currently in the process of setting up internships and a study abroad program for college students. BCI‚Äôs main ministry options for teams and missionaries are as follows: *Children & Youth Ministry ‚Äì Vacation Bible School, dramas, puppets, crafts, worship, skits, games, Bible stories, speaking at youth gatherings and devotionals *Sports Ministry ‚Äì Football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, and especially soccer *School Ministry ‚Äì Aid teachers in classes, teach special subjects, hold rallies, participate in recess, tutor students, fellowship with children before & after school *Service Projects ‚Äì Home repairs for widows and impoverished families, digging water wells, constructing sanitary facilities, providing food & home visits *Medical & Dental Care ‚Äì Groups with medical dental staff can do physical checkups on sponsored children and their families during home visits or host a free health clinic *Construction ‚Äì There is always a need for people to help with construction at the new school, with homes for the poor, and in the local churches *Ministry of Helps ‚Äì Pastoral care, visiting shut-ins, hospital visitation, ministering to pastors' wives and otherwise assisting the pastoral staff of local churches *Church Ministries ‚Äì Attend and participate in church services, Sunday school classes and prayer meetings *Evangelism ‚Äì Hand out Bibles, door-to-door evangelism, street evangelism, clowning, miming, juggling, and drama; larger groups can hold special evangelistic crusades *Adult Ministry ‚Äì Parenting classes, Bible studies, topical studies, leadership training, coffee & tea socials to minister to the women, and special men‚Äôs gatherings Blessing the Children teams and missionaries stay in BCI guest houses. Their guest houses are meant to be comfortable by resembling an American house, with bedrooms, a living room, dining room, bathroom, and kitchen. Though not typical in Ethiopia, bathrooms have hot water. The kitchens are small, but equipped with the essentials, and meals are usually prepared family-style.

It is at and straddles the B6397 Gordon to Kelso road. The village is almost equidistant from both, standing northwest of the abbey town of Kelso. Since local government reorganisation in Scotland in the early 1970s, Smailholm has been part of the Scottish Borders Council.  History  Smailholm, in keeping with most of the south eastern part of Scotland, was part of the ancient Kingdom of Northumbria and was named from the Old English language as Smael Ham, meaning \\"narrow village\\".http://www.smailholm.bordernet.co.uk/history/ In early mediaeval times, the village was larger than it is now and was divided into three separate parts, East Third, West Third and Overtown. Sir Walter Scott, as a boy, was a regular visitor to his grandfather's farm at Sandyknowe. Captain Cook's mother Jean was born in Smailholm and married his father in Smailholm Church. Before the end of the 18th century, there were two schools in the village, a parochial school and a private establishment at Sandyknowe. St. Cuthbert is believed to have been born at Wrangham, a long disappeared village at New Smailholm. King Edward I of England passed through Smailholm in 1303 on his march to Lauder. Smailholm Church  Church  David de Oliford was granted the church and manor of Smailholm in the 12th century by King David I of Scotland. De Oliford subsequently granted the church and its tithes to the Benedictine monks of Coldingham Priory who held the church until the Scottish Reformation in 1560. Smailholm Kirk avoided demolition after the Reformation, and parts of an early Norman structure can still be seen in the chancel. The present church has had major renovation and renewal in 1632 and 1820.http://www.smailholm.bordernet.co.uk/history/church.html The church contains fine stained glass windows from 1907 commemorating Sir Walter Scott. Some of the ministers in the early years of the reformed church include David Forsyth, Archibald Oswald and James Hunter.  Smailholm Tower  Smailholm Tower in the winter Smailholm Tower, one in a string of Borders keeps guarding the Tweed valley, was built not later than the early 15th century, when it was held by the powerful Pringle family,http://www.smailholm.bordernet.co.uk/history/tower.html four of whom were killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The tower passed, in 1745, to the Scotts of Harden, but they left the structure in 1800. The tower fell into a perilous condition but was partially restored in the 1980s and is now in the care of Historic Scotland.  In popular culture  * Smailholm appeared in the third case of Ben Jordan: Paranormal Investigator, in which the titular hero investigates the mysterious ritual murder of two local girls, and discovers a shocking secret about the town √† la The Wicker Man. * It features in the book by C.L.

EFA is a technique within factor analysis whose overarching goal is to identify the underlying relationships between measured variables. It is commonly used by researchers when developing a scale (a scale is a collection of questions used to measure a particular research topic) and serves to identify a set of latent constructs underlying a battery of measured variables. It should be used when the researcher has no a priori hypothesis about factors or patterns of measured variables. Measured variables are any one of several attributes of people that may be observed and measured. Examples of measured variables could be the physical height, weight, and pulse rate of a human being. Usually, researchers would have a large number of measured variables, which are assumed to be related to a smaller number of \\"unobserved\\" factors. Researchers must carefully consider the number of measured variables to include in the analysis. EFA procedures are more accurate when each factor is represented by multiple measured variables in the analysis. EFA is based on the common factor model. In this model, manifest variables are expressed as a function of common factors, unique factors, and errors of measurement. Each unique factor influences only one manifest variable, and does not explain correlations between manifest variables. Common factors influence more than one manifest variable and \\"factor loadings\\" are measures of the influence of a common factor on a manifest variable. For the EFA procedure, we are more interested in identifying the common factors and the related manifest variables. EFA assumes that any indicator/measured variable may be associated with any factor. When developing a scale, researchers should use EFA first before moving on to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA is essential to determine underlying factors/constructs for a set of measured variables; while CFA allows the researcher to test the hypothesis that a relationship between the observed variables and their underlying latent exists.Suhr, D. D. (2006). Exploratory or confirmatory factor analysis? (pp. 1-17). Cary: SAS Institute. EFA requires the researcher to make a number of important decisions about how to conduct the analysis because there is no one set method. Fitting procedures Fitting procedures are used to estimate the factor loadings and unique variances of the model (Factor loadings are the regression coefficients between items and factors and measure the influence of a common factor on a measured variable). There are several factor analysis fitting methods to choose from, however there is little information on all of their strengths and weaknesses and many don't even have an exact name that is used consistently. Principal axis factoring (PAF) and maximum likelihood (ML) are two extraction methods that are generally recommended. In general, ML or PAF give the best results, depending on whether data are normally-distributed or if the assumption of normality has been violated. Maximum likelihood (ML) The maximum likelihood method has many advantages in that it allows researchers to compute of a wide range of indexes of the goodness of fit of the model, it allows researchers to test the statistical significance of factor loadings, calculate correlations among factors and compute confidence intervals for these parameters. ML is the best choice when data are normally distributed because ‚Äúit allows for the computation of a wide range of indexes of the goodness of fit of the model [and] permits statistical significance testing of factor loadings and correlations among factors and the computation of confidence intervals‚Äù. Principal axis factoring (PAF) Called ‚Äúprincipal‚Äù axis factoring because the first factor accounts for as much common variance as possible, then the second factor next most variance, and so on. PAF is a descriptive procedure so it is best to use when the focus is just on your sample and you do not plan to generalize the results beyond your sample. A downside of PAF is that it provides a limited range of goodness-of-fit indexes compared to ML and does not allow for the computation of confidence intervals and significance tests. Selecting the appropriate number of factors When selecting how many factors to include in a model, researchers must try to balance parsimony (a model with relatively few factors) and plausibility (that there are enough factors to adequately account for correlations among measured variables). Overfactoring occurs when too many factors are included in a model and may lead researchers to put forward constructs with little theoretical value. Underfactoring occurs when too few factors are included in a model. If not enough factors are included in a model, there is likely to be substantial error. Measured variables that load onto a factor not included in the model can falsely load on factors that are included, altering true factor loadings. This can result in rotated solutions in which two factors are combined into a single factor, obscuring the true factor structure. There are a number of procedures designed to determine the optimal number of factors to retain in EFA. These include Kaiser's (1960) eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule (or K1 rule), Cattell's (1966) scree plot,Cattell, R. B. (1966). The scree test for the number of factors. Multivariate Behavioral Research, I, 245-276. Revelle and Rocklin's (1979) very simple structure criterion, model comparison techniques, Raiche, Roipel, and Blais's (2006) acceleration factor and optimal coordinates,Raiche, G., Roipel, M., & Blais, J. G.|Non graphical solutions for the Cattell‚Äôs scree test. Paper presented at The International Annual Meeting of the Psychometric Society, Montreal|date=2006|Retrieved December 10, 2012 from Velicer's (1976) minimum average partial, Horn's (1965) parallel analysis, and Ruscio and Roche's (2012) comparison data. Recent simulation studies assessing the robustness of such techniques suggest that the latter five can better assist practitioners to judiciously model data. These five modern techniques are now easily accessible through integrated use of IBM SPSS Statistics software (SPSS) and R (R Development Core Team, 2011). See Courtney (2013)Courtney, M. G. R. (2013). Determining the number of factors to retain in EFA: Using the SPSS R-Menu v2.0 to make more judicious estimations. Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation, 18(8). Available online: for guidance on how to carry out these procedures for continuous, ordinal, and heterogenous (continuous and ordinal) data. With the exception of Revelle and Rocklin's (1979) very simple structure criterion, model comparison techniques, and Velicer's (1976) minimum average partial, all other procedures rely on the analysis of eigenvalues. The eigenvalue of a factor represents the amount of variance of the variables accounted for by that factor. The lower the eigenvalue, the less that factor contributes to explaining the variance of the variables. A short description of each of the nine procedures mentioned above is provided below. Kaiser's (1960) eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule (K1 or Kaiser criterion) Compute the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix and determine how many of these eigenvalues are greater than 1. This number is the number of factors to include in the model. A disadvantage of this procedure is that it is quite arbitrary (e.g., an eigenvalue of 1.01 is included whereas an eigenvalue of .99 is not). This procedure often leads to overfactoring and sometimes underfactoring. Therefore, this procedure should not be used. A variation of the K1 criterion has been created to lessen the severity of the criterion's problems where a researcher calculates confidence intervals for each eigenvalue and retains only factors which have the entire confidence interval greater than 1.0. Cattell's (1966) scree plot Compute the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix and plot the values from largest to smallest. Examine the graph to determine the last substantial drop in the magnitude of eigenvalues. The number of plotted points before the last drop is the number of factors to include in the model. This method has been criticized because of its subjective nature (i.e., there is no clear objective definition of what constitutes a substantial drop). As this procedure is subjective, Courtney (2013) does not recommend it. Revelle and Rocklin (1979) very simple structure Revelle and Rocklin's (1979) VSS criterion operationalizes this tendency by assessing the extent to which the original correlation matrix is reproduced by a simplified pattern matrix, in which only the highest loading for each item is retained, all other loadings being set to zero. The VSS criterion for assessing the extent of replication can take values between 0 and 1, and is a measure of the goodness-of-fit of the factor solution. The VSS criterion is gathered from factor solutions that involve one factor (k = 1) to a user-specified theoretical maximum number of factors. Thereafter, the factor solution that provides the highest VSS criterion determines the optimal number of interpretable factors in the matrix. In an attempt to accommodate datasets where items covary with more than one factor (i.e., more factorially complex data), the criterion can also be carried out with simplified pattern matrices in which the highest two loadings are retained, with the rest set to zero (Max VSS complexity 2). Courtney also does not recommend VSS because of lack of robust simulation research concerning the performance of the VSS criterion. Model comparison techniques Choose the best model from a series of models that differ in complexity. Researchers use goodness-of-fit measures to fit models beginning with a model with zero factors and gradually increase the number of factors. The goal is to ultimately choose a model that explains the data significantly better than simpler models (with fewer factors) and explains the data as well as more complex models (with more factors). There are different methods that can be used to assess model fit: *Likelihood ratio statistic:Lawley, D. N. (1940). The estimation of factor loadings by the method of maximumlikelihood. Proceedings of the Royal Society ofedinborough, 60A, 64-82. Used to test the null hypothesis that a model has perfect model fit. It should be applied to models with an increasing number of factors until the result is nonsignificant, indicating that the model is not rejected as good model fit of the population. This statistic should be used with a large sample size and normally distributed data. There are some drawbacks to the likelihood ratio test. First, when there is a large sample size, even small discrepancies between the model and the data result in model rejection. When there is a small sample size, even large discrepancies between the model and data may not be significant, which leads to underfactoring. Another disadvantage of the likelihood ratio test is that the null hypothesis of perfect fit is an unrealistic standard. *Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) fit index: RMSEA is an estimate of the discrepancy between the model and the data per degree of freedom for the model. Values less that .05 constitute good fit, values between 0.05 and 0.08 constitute acceptable fit, a values between 0.08 and 0.10 constitute marginal fit and values greater than 0.10 indicate poor fit .Steiger, J. H. (1989). EzPATH: A supplementary module for SYSTAT andsygraph. Evanston, IL: SYSTAT An advantage of the RMSEA fit index is that it provides confidence intervals which allow researchers to compare a series of models with varying numbers of factors. Optimal Coordinate and Acceleration Factor In an attempt to overcome the subjective weakness of Cattell's (1966) scree test,Raiche, Roipel, and Blais (2006) presented two families of non-graphical solutions. The first method, coined the optimal coordinate (OC), attempts to determine the location of the scree by measuring the gradients associated with eigenvalues and their preceding coordinates. The second method, coined the acceleration factor (AF), pertains to a numerical solution for determining the coordinate where the slope of the curve changes most abruptly. Both of these methods have out- performed the K1 method in simulation. In the Ruscio and Roche study (2012), the OC method was correct 74.03% of the time rivaling the PA technique (76.42%). The AF method was correct 45.91% of the time with a tendency toward under-estimation. Both the OC and AF methods, generated with the use of Pearson correlation coefficients, were reviewed in Ruscio and Roche's (2012) simulation study. Results suggested that both techniques performed quite well under ordinal response categories of two to seven (C = 2-7) and quasi- continuous (C = 10 or 20) data situations. Given the accuracy of these procedures under simulation, they are highly recommended for determining the number of factors to retain in EFA. It is one of Courtney's 5 recommended modern procedures. Velicer's Minimum Average Partial test (MAP) Velicer's (1976) MAP test ‚Äúinvolves a complete principal components analysis followed by the examination of a series of matrices of partial correlations‚Äù (p. 397). The squared correlation for Step ‚Äú0‚Äù (see Figure 4) is the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the unpartialed correlation matrix. On Step 1, the first principal component and its associated items are partialed out. Thereafter, the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the subsequent correlation matrix is computed for Step 1. On Step 2, the first two principal components are partialed out and the resultant average squared off- diagonal correlation is again computed. The computations are carried out for k minus one steps (k representing the total number of variables in the matrix). Finally, the average squared correlations for all steps are lined up and the step number that resulted in the lowest average squared partial correlation determines the number of components or factors to retain (Velicer, 1976). By this method, components are maintained as long as the variance in the correlation matrix represents systematic variance, as opposed to residual or error variance. Although methodologically akin to principal components analysis, the MAP technique has been shown to perform quite well in determining the number of factors to retain in multiple simulation studies.Garrido, L. E., & Abad, F. J., & Ponsoda, V. (2012). A new look at Horn's parallel analysis with ordinal variables. Psychological Methods. Advance online publication. doi:10.1037/a0030005 However, in a very small minority of cases MAP may grossly overestimate the number of factors in a dataset for unknown reasons. This procedure is made available through SPSS's user interface. See Courtney (2013) for guidance. This is one of his five recommended modern procedures. Parallel analysis To carry out the PA test, users compute the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix and plot the values from largest to smallest and then plot a set of random eigenvalues. The number of eigenvalues before the intersection points indicates how many factors to include in your model. This procedure can be somewhat arbitrary (i.e. a factor just meeting the cutoff will be included and one just below will not). Moreover, the method is very sensitive to sample size, with PA suggesting more factors in datasets with larger sample sizes. Despite its shortcomings, this procedure performs very well in simulation studies and is one of Courtney's recommended procedures. PA has been implemented in a number of commonly used statistics programs such as R and SPSS. Ruscio and Roche's comparison data In 2012 Ruscio and Roche introduced the comparative data (CD) procedure in an attempt improve upon the PA method. The authors state that \\"rather than generating random datasets, which only take into account sampling error, multiple datasets with known factorial structures are analyzed to determine which best reproduces the profile of eigenvalues for the actual data\\" (p. 258). The strength of the procedure is its ability to not only incorporate sampling error, but also the factorial structure and multivariate distribution of the items. Ruscio and Roche's (2012) simulation study determined that the CD procedure outperformed many other methods aimed at determining the correct number of factors to retain. In that study, the CD technique, making use of Pearson correlations accurately predicted the correct number of factors 87.14% of the time. However, the simulated study never involved more than five factors. Therefore, the applicability of the CD procedure to estimate factorial structures beyond five factors is yet to be tested. Courtney includes this procedure in his recommended list and gives guidelines showing how it can be easily carried out from within SPSS's user interface. Convergence of multiple tests A review of 60 journal articles by Henson and Roberts (2006) found that none used multiple modern techniques in an attempt to find convergence, such as PA and Velicer's (1976) minimum average partial (MAP) procedures. Ruscio and Roche (2012) simulation study demonstrated the empirical advantage of seeking convergence. When the CD and PA procedures agreed, the accuracy of the estimated number of factors was correct 92.2% of the time. Ruscio and Roche (2012) demonstrated that when further tests were in agreement, the accuracy of the estimation could be increased even further. Tailoring Courtney's recommended procedures for ordinal and continuous data Recent simulation studies in the field of psychometrics suggest that the parallel analysis, minimum average partial, and comparative data techniques can be improved for different data situations. For example, in simulation studies, the performance of the minimum average partial test, when ordinal data is concerned, can be improved by utilizing polychoric correlations, as opposed to Pearson correlations. Courtney (2013) details how each of these three procedures can be optimized and carried out simultaneously from within the SPSS interface. Factor rotation Factor rotation is a commonly employed step in EFA, used to aide interpretation of factor matrixes. For any solution with two or more factors there are an infinite number of orientations of the factors that will explain the data equally well. Because there is no unique solution, a researcher must select a single solution from the infinite possibilities. The goal of factor rotation is to rotate factors in multidimensional space to arrive at a solution with best simple structure. There are two main types of factor rotation: orthogonal and oblique rotation. Orthogonal rotation Orthogonal rotations constrain factors to be perpendicular to each other and hence uncorrelated. An advantage of orthogonal rotation is its simplicity and conceptual clarity, although there are several disadvantages. In the social sciences, there is often a theoretical basis for expecting constructs to be correlated, therefore orthogonal rotations may not be very realistic because they do not allow this. Also, because orthogonal rotations require factors to be uncorrelated, they are less likely to produce solutions with simple structure. Varimax rotation is an orthogonal rotation of the factor axes to maximize the variance of the squared loadings of a factor (column) on all the variables (rows) in a factor matrix, which has the effect of differentiating the original variables by extracted factor. Each factor will tend to have either large or small loadings of any particular variable. A varimax solution yields results which make it as easy as possible to identify each variable with a single factor. This is the most common orthogonal rotation option. Quartimax rotation is an orthogonal rotation that maximizes the squared loadings for each variable rather than each factor. This minimizes the number of factors needed to explain each variable. This type of rotation often generates a general factor on which most variables are loaded to a high or medium degree. Equimax rotation is a compromise between varimax and quartimax criteria. Oblique rotation Oblique rotations permit correlations among factors. An advantage of oblique rotation is that it produces solutions with better simple structure when factors are expected to correlate, and it produces estimates of correlations among factors.. These rotations may produce solutions similar to orthogonal rotation if the factors do not correlate with each other. Several oblique rotation procedures are commonly used. Direct oblimin rotation is the standard oblique rotation method. Promax rotation is often seen in older literature because it is easier to calculate than oblimin. Other oblique methods include direct quartimin rotation and Harris-Kaiser orthoblique rotation. Unrotated solution Common factor analysis software is capable of producing an unrotated solution. This refers to the result of a principal axis factoring with no further rotation. The so-called unrotated solution is in fact an orthogonal rotation that maximizes the variance of the first factors. The unrotated solution tends to give a general factor with loadings for most of the variables. This may be useful if many variables are correlated with each other, as revealed by one or a few dominating eigenvalues on a scree plot. The usefulness of an unrotated solution was emphasized by a meta analysis of studies of cultural differences. This revealed that many published studies of cultural differences have given similar factor analysis results, but rotated differently. Factor rotation has obscured the similarity between the results of different studies and the existence of a strong general factor, while the unrotated solutions were much more similar.. Factor interpretation Factor loadings are numerical values that indicate the strength and direction of a factor on a measured variable. Factor loadings indicate how strongly the factor influences the measured variable. In order to label the factors in the model, researchers should examine the factor pattern to see which items load highly on which factors and then determine what those items have in common. Whatever the items have in common will indicate the meaning of the factor.

The catastrophe claimed the lives of 146 people, almost all of whom were aged between 17 and 30. The scale of the disaster shocked the French nation. Subsequent official enquiries revealed a catalogue of shortcomings, oversights and evasions with regard to fire safety at both local and d√©partement level. Criminal charges were brought against a number of people; some received suspended jail sentences.  Venue  The Club Cinq-Sept (or Club 5‚Äì7), which was situated in a relatively isolated location 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from Saint- Laurent-du-Pont, opened for business in April 1970. It was housed within a newly constructed large, open-plan windowless structure with external walls built of breeze blocks supporting a corrugated iron roof. The main entrance to the club was via a spiked full-height turnstile. The ground floor housed a dance floor, bar and restaurant, with simulated grottos constructed of polyurethane and papier-m√¢ch√© around the walls. A single spiral staircase led to a gallery which ran right round the building and contained more alcoves and grottos. The roof was supported by pillars which were decorated with various flammable materials.Canning, J: Great Disasters, pages 100‚Äì101. Ivy Leaf Books, 1990. . The Club Cinq-Sept quickly established itself as a popular draw for young people in the region, attracting customers from Saint-Laurent-du- Pont, the nearby towns of Chamb√©ry and Voiron, and the city of Grenoble, 20 miles (32 km) away.  Fire  On the night of 31 October/1 November 1970, the Club Cinq-Sept had drawn a large crowd to watch a live performance by Les Storms, an up-and-coming six-piece rock group from Paris. An estimated 180 people were still in the club at 1:40 a.m. when a fire broke out. It was reportedly caused by a carelessly discarded match igniting a foam-filled seat cushion on the first floor gallery. The blaze spread rapidly through the roof space fuelled by the building's flammable d√©cor and furnishings. People in the gallery struggled to escape down the single spiral staircase as flames spread across the ceiling. Only 30 people within the main club area managed to exit the building via the main entrance turnstile before a huge wall of fire plunged down from the gallery turning the whole building into an inferno. Few managed to escape after this point. Of those who did, most suffered severe burn injuries. The club had no telephone on the premises. One of the club's managers, Gilbert Bas, was among those who had managed to escape and he had to drive into Saint-Laurent-du-Pont to raise the alarm. With the great speed with which the fire engulfed the building and the delay in alerting the emergency services, there was little the arriving firemen could do when they eventually reached the club. The intensity of the fire completely gutted the interior of the building and caused the roof to melt and collapse. When firemen were able to enter the building, they found 140 bodies within, most too badly burned for visual identification to be possible. Six badly-injured survivors were transferred to a specialised burn treatment unit in Lyon; four would succumb to their injuries, bringing the final death toll to 146.Le Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© ‚Äì article published on 30th anniversary of the disaster (in French) Two of the club's three managers were among the dead, as were all six members of Les Storms.  Investigation and prosecution  Three days after the fire, the mayor of Saint-Laurent-du-Pont and the Secretary-General of the Is√®re d√©partement were removed from their duties. This rapid move provoked a degree of controversy as it was seen by some, including a number of local politicians in Is√®re, as premature scapegoating before the full facts had been investigated. An official enquiry held in Grenoble found that many fire safety regulations had been breached. Planning permission had been obtained for the construction of the building, but French law also required an inspection of the finished structure by Building Safety and Fire Department officials prior to opening for business; this had not been done. There was no firefighting equipment on the premises, and unsafe materials were inappropriately used for internal furnishing and decoration. The gallery level had no emergency exit; its only means of egress was the spiral staircase and through the main club. The inquiry heard that, as required by law, the club had two exit doors in addition to the main entrance. However, in contravention of fire regulations, neither was marked; also, both were routinely locked and barred by the club managers in order to prevent patrons inside the building opening them to let others in free of charge. Although three managers held keys, two had succumbed to the effects of the fire and the third, Bas, had left to raise the alarm. The investigation heard how a man who had earlier escaped from the building managed to break open one of the doors, through which one woman was rescued alive; many others trapped behind the doors trying to escape had already perished. In June 1971, Bas was charged with, and found guilty of, manslaughter in relation to the deaths. He received a two-year suspended sentence. The mayor and three building contractors were found guilty of causing injury through negligence, and received short suspended sentences.

L. Bartholomew A chalk talk is an illustrated performance in which the speaker draws pictures to emphasize lecture points and create a memorable and entertaining experience for listeners. Chalk talks differ from other types of illustrated talks in their use of real-time illustration rather than static images. They achieved great popularity during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, appearing in vaudeville shows, Chautauqua assemblies, religious rallies, and smaller venues. Since their inception, chalk talks have been both a popular form of entertainment and a pedagogical tool. Early history Illustration by Frank Beard showing a Sunday School teacher giving a chalk talk. One of the earliest chalk talk artists was a prohibition illustrator named Frank Beard (1842-1905). Beard was a professional illustrator and editorial cartoonist who published in The Ram's Horn, an interdenominational social gospel magazine. Beard's wife was a Methodist, and when the women of their church asked Beard to draw some pictures as part of an evening of entertainment they were planning, the chalk talk was born. In 1896, Beard published Chalk lessons; or, The black-board in the Sunday school which he dedicated to the Rev. Albert D. Vail \\"Through whose simple Black-board teaching I was first led to search the Scriptures and my own heart.\\" Public performance  Like magic lantern shows and Lyceum lectures, chalk talks, with their presentation of images changing in real-time, could be educational as well as entertaining. They were choreographed performances \\"where the images would become animate, melding one into another in an orderly and progressive way\\" to tell a story. Chalk talks began to be used for religious rallies and became popular acts in vaudeville and at Chautuaqua assemblies. Some performers, such as James Stuart Blackton created acts around \\"lightning sketches,\\" drawings which were rapidly modified as the audience looked on. \\"Tricks\\" or illustrative techniques used by performers were called \\"stunts.\\" The seemingly magical stunts, and the chalk talk artist's power to transform simple images before their audiences' eyes appealed to magicians. Cartoonist and magician Harlan Tarbell performed as a chalk-talker and published several chalk talk method books. Signed illustration by John Wilson Bengough of the cartoonist presenting a chalk talk about woman suffrage. Winsor McCay began doing vaudeville chalk talks in 1906.Film reference: Winsor McCay In his The Seven Ages of Man vaudeville act, he drew two infant faces, a boy and a girl, and progressively aged them.Stabile, Carol A. and Mark Harrison. Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture. Routledge, 2003. Popular illustrator Vernon Grant was also known for his vaudeville circuit chalk talks. Pulitzer prize winning cartoonist John T. McCutcheon was a popular chalk talk performer. Artist and suffragist Adele Goodman Clark set up her easel on a street corner to convince listeners to support woman suffrage. Canadian cartoonist John Wilson Bengough toured internationally, giving chalk talks both for entertainment and in support of causes including woman suffrage and prohibition. Animation Chalk talks contributed to the development of early animated films, such as The Enchanted Drawing, by J. Stuart Blackton and his partner, Alfred E. Smith. Blackton's Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906) was another early animation with its roots in chalk talks. For his early films, Winsor McCay borrowed Blackton's image of the artist standing before drawings which come to life. References External links *Charles L.

She served during the French and Indian War, most notably at Louisbourg and Quebec, and the American Revolution, during which she captured two French privateers. The Royal Navy sold her in 1783. J. Montgomery purchased her and she became the Greenland whaler Union. Then in 1790‚Äì91 she became a slaver, making five slave-trading voyages. Between 1796 and 1802 she made two voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). She then traded between London and Liverpool. She was last listed in 1804. Career Royal Navy service Seven Years War (1756‚Äì1763) Captain Hyde Parker commissioned Squirrel in October 1755. A year or so later, on 10 October 1756 he captured the privateer Tr√®s V√©nƒórable. On 31 May 1757 Squirrel captured the American ship America, Lewis Ferret, master. Her owners appealed the seizure but the court of appeal ruled that America had delivered a cargo to San Domingo, and there picked up another cargo, owned by French subjects and all pursuant to French taxes, duties, etc., and having destroyed her documents, America was de facto a French ship and so the condemnation as a prize should stand. On 17 June Squirrel and Parker were at Embden where she stopped any forage being brought in to the French forces there. Around December Commander Joshua Loring was in command of Squirrel, and was promoted to post captain on 19 December. That same month Captain John Wheelock assumed command of Squirrel. Wheelock sailed Squirrel for North America on 15 January 1758. Squirrel was part of the British naval force at the siege of Louisbourg in 1757. During the landings at Gabarus Bay on 8 June she provided fire support on the right flank. At this time she was under the command of Commander George Hamilton. During the summer of 1759 Squirrel was part of the British naval force at the siege of Quebec. On 18 July she, under Hamilton's command, was part of a small squadron that ran up the river past the city. The vessels included , of 50 guns, three transports with three companies of grenadiers and a battalion of the Royal Americans, and two armed sloops. , of 32 guns, was part of the squadron, but she grounded and did not make the passage. Squirrel was among the Royal Navy vessels that received prize money for the capture of a number of small vessels in the St Lawrence River in 1759. At some point Squirrel came under the command of Captain John Cleland, either before or after she returned to England. On 31 January 1760 he sailed her for the Mediterranean. On 5 February 1760 Squirrel was escorting a fleet from Cork to Gibraltar.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2512. Lloyd's List reported on 17 June that Squirrel and had carried into Leghorn a French ship that had been sailing from Marseilles to Constantinople.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2549. This may have been the polacca St. Francis de Paul that they captured on 9 May, in company with . More probably, it may have been the polacca St Barbe that Squirrel and Kennington captured on 22 May. Squirrel returned to England and was paid off in June. At some point she was recommissioned. On 15 March 1761 Squirrel captured the pinque Marie. In 1762 Squirrel was in North America. In April she was in the Mediterranean and under the command of Captain James Cranston. He was still in command at the end of the Seven Years' War on 23 February 1763. Between wars In May Captain Richard Smith recommissioned Squirrel as she underwent fitting at Chatham between May and July. He then sailed her for the West Indies on 28 August. From 1764 to 1766 she was stationed at New Jersey. There she was used to enforce customs laws in New England prior to the American Revolution. In 1764 while in Newport, Rhode Island Squirrel came to the assistance of , which American colonists on Goat Island (Rhode Island) had fired on. The colonists dispersed before Squirrel brought her guns to bear.Golway (2005), p. 25. Squirrel returned to England and was paid off in January 1767. Between January and September she was at Chatham undergoing repairs and fitting out. Captain John Botterell commissioned her in July, and sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 9 October 1787. In November 1769 she was still in the Leeward Islands, and her commander was Captain Edward Cauldwell. She returned to England and was paid off in January 1772. In January Squirrel underwent a survey at Sheerness. Then between April 1772 and January 1774 she underwent a great repair there, and fitting out. In November 1773 Captain Stair Douglass recommissioned her. He then sailed for Jamaica on 31 January 1774. American Revolutionary War By March 1775 Squirrel was one of only five vessels on the Jamaica Station. In November, Admiral Clark Gayton, commanding the Jamaica Station, issued orders to Douglass to sail to the \\"little Caicos\\" and there to intercept and detain vessels coming from the island and carrying military stores to the rebels.Clark (1964), Vol. 2, pp. 1195‚Äì96. By December Squirrel was stationed at \\"Little Caicos\\".Clark (1964), Vol. 3, p. 43. In January 1776 Squirrel was still one of only five vessels on the Jamaica Station. Stephen Fuller, agent for the island of Jamaica, on 27 January wrote to Lord Germain listing the vessels available on that the station and pointing out that there were too few to provide an escort for the next fleet leaving the island.Clark (1964), Vol. 3, pp. 1022‚Äì23. During the month Squirrel sent into Jamaica two sloops, one from Cape Nichola with French produce, and the other from the Turks Islands, with salt. Both were sailing to \\"the Rebellious Colonies\\".Clark (1964), Vol. 3, p. 906. The first was the sloop Cornelia, of New York, Robert Sands, master, taken on 29 December 1775 with a cargo of molasses and coffee. The second was the sloop Affie & Hannah, of New York, Benjamin Bell, master, taken on 2 January 1776 with a cargo of salt.Clark (1964), Vol. 4, p. 517. Next, Squirrel sent in a schooner to Port Royal with French produce and French papers. When Douglass examined her he had discovered that her mate and three seamen were English. The mate confessed that her home port was Philadelphia and that the master had hidden her English papers. There was sufficient evidence to prove that she was an American vessel and so subject to condemnation.Clark (1994), Vol. 3, p. 1143. This was the sloop Thames, of Philadelphia, J. Fairibelt, master, taken on 30 January with a cargo of rum and molasses. On 10 February Jamaica was unsettled by Douglass's report that he had encountered three French ships, part of a flotilla bringing 17,000 men to Hispaniola.Clark (1964), Vol. 3, p. 1209. On 25 March Squirrel took the brig Industry, of South Carolina, Edward Allen, master, sailing in ballast. In late 1776 the former slave Olaudah Equiano came under Douglass's protection after Equiano got into a dispute in Jamaica with a local notable. Equiano sailed with Douglass back to England. On the way Squirrel captured an American privateer. Squirrel arrived back in England on 7 January 1777 at Plymouth. Between January and March 1777 Squirrel was at Portsmouth, undergoing fitting. Captain Henry Harvey recommissioned her and sailed her for Newfoundland on 14 April. She sailed with the African trade on 15 February 1778. On 6 September Squirrel took Betsy. In 1779 Squirrel was in home waters and under the command of Captain Farmery Epworth. In April 1780 Captain Thomas Piercy replaced Epworth. Between October and December 1781 Squirrel was at Plymouth receiving copper sheathing, and being refitted. Still, on 23 December 1781 Squirrel was in company with , , and at the capture of the Dutch ship De Vrow Esther. Captain John Inglis assumed command in 1782. On 15 February Squirrel captured the privateer Furet. Furet may have been the cutter of 10 guns that other records show Inglis capturing.Political Magazine and Parliamentary, Naval, Military, and Literary Journal (1783), Vol. 6, p. 367. On 21 June, Squirrel, Captain John Inglis, encountered a French privateer cutter off Lands End and chased for ten hours before she struck her colours. She proved to be Aimable Manon, of eight guns and 42 men. She was 14 days out of Brest and had caught nothing. Then four days later, Squirrel recaptured Penelope, which had been sailing from Liverpool to Cork with a cargo of salt and sugar when the French privateer Escamoteur had captured her going into Waterford. Lloyd's List reported on 5 July 1782 that Squirrel had sent Penelope into Falmouth.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1376. Disposal The Navy paid Squirrel off at the end of June. It sold her on 16 January 1783 at Sheerness for ¬£1,100, plus an additional ¬£302 5s for the copper on her bottom.Winfield (2007), p. 262.

Lloyd's Register (1786) reports that she underwent repairs in 1786, and the listing also gives her burthen as 400 tons, instead of 300 tons as in the 1784 volume.Lloyd's Register (1786), Seq. ‚ÑñU16. On 11 July 1786 Lloyd's List reported that Union was still with other whalers at Greenland and had taken three \\"fish\\".Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1793.

Bailie as master, and her trade became London‚ÄîAfrica.Lloyd's Register (1790), Seq. ‚ÑñU16. That is, she became a slaver. Lloyd's Register (1791) shows that her owner became Calvert & Co., and that she underwent coppering, and a thorough repair. Her master became James Tomson and Union then made five slave-trading voyages, primarily between the Gold Coast and Jamaica. Her owners were Anthony Calvert, Thomas King, and William Camden.Trans-Atlantic Slave Slave Trade Voyages Database. On her first voyage Thomson sailed from England on 18 May 1790, and arrived at the Gold Coast on 9 August. He gathered his slaves at Cape Coast Castle and Anomabu. Union sailed from Africa on 20 October, and arrived at Jamaica 13 December. There she delivered her slaves at Black River. She had embarked 503 slaves and she disembarked 461, for a loss rate of 8.3%. She arrived back at London on 22 July 1791. On her second voyage, Thomson left London on 26 August, and arrived at the Gold Coast on 13 October. He gathered slaves at Cape Lahoue and Cape Coast Castle, but primarily at Anomabu. Union sailed from Africa 15 January 1792, and arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, 2 March. There she discharged 536 slaves, having embarked 543. Her loss rate was only 1.3%. At some point her master changed to Robert Currie. She sailed from Jamaica on 10 April, but bound for Africa again, rather than home. Thomson had returned to command of Union and she gathered her slaves at Anomabu and Cape Coast Castle. She left Africa on 21 October, and arrived back at Jamaica on 16 December. She had embarked 549 slaves, and she disembarked 538, for a 2% loss rate. She returned to London 5 May 1793. Shortly before Union returned to England, war with France broke out. James Thompson received a letter of marque on 18 June 1793.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793‚Äì1815\\"; p. 90. Or her fourth slaving voyage, Thomson and Union left London on 10 July and arrived at Africa on 19 September. She again gathered slaves at Cape Coast Castle and Anomabu, and arrived at Jamaica on 15 May 1794. She had embarked 584 slaves and disembarked 535, for a loss rate of 8.3%. Union arrived back at London on 19 August. On her fifth, and last, slave voyage Thomson sailed Union from London on 31 October, bound for the Gold Coast. She arrived there on 6 April 1795, and gathered her slaves at Cape Coast Castle and Anomabu. She arrived with them at Jamaica on 25 May. She had embarked 549 slaves, and she disembarked 545, for a 0.7% loss rate. Union returned to England on 30 June. Voyages for the EIC In 1796 R. Owen became Unions master, and her trade changed to London‚ÄîEast Indies.Lloyd's Register (1796), Seq.‚ÑñU45. That year Union was also rebuilt, and her burthen changed to 476 tons.Lloyd's Register (1799), Seq. ‚ÑñU36. On 21 May 1796 Captain Richard Owen sailed Union from Portsmouth, bound for Bengal on a voyage for the EIC. Union reached Gibraltar on 14 June and the Cape of Good Hope on 19 September, and arrived at Calcutta on 2 March 1797. Homeward bound, she left Calcutta on 2 May, reached St Helena, and arrived at the Downs on 12 December.British Library: Union (3). Lloyd's Register continues to show Union, Owen, master, trading with India through 1804. However, on 30 July 1801, Captain John Luke sailed Union from Bengal, leaving Calcutta on 30 July. On 12 September she was at Saugor. She reached St Helena on 1 January 1802, and arrived at the Downs on 23 February. Then the Register of Shipping for 1802 shows Union, Hutchinson, master, Calvert, owner, trading between London and Liverpool.Register of Shipping (1802), Seq. ‚Ññ50.

The district includes the communities of Baileyville, Kelly, Oneida, Seneca, St. Benedict and nearby rural areas of Nemaha County. Schools The school district operates the following schools: * Nemaha Central High School * Nemaha Central Elementary and Middle School History In 1859, the first organized classes in Seneca were taught in the parlor of the Smith hotel.Cutler, William G. History of the State of Kansas, containing a full account of its growth from an uninhabited territory to a wealthy and important State .... Chicago: A.T. Andreas, 1883. As the class sizes increased, they were moved to the Nemaha County Courthouse. In 1865, the community build a brick schoolhouse at the site of the current Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church now in Seneca. The school employed two teachers, and it marked the beginning of a graded school system in the village. In 1868, the school became known as District No. 11. To accommodate a growing population, the district built a four-room stone schoolhouse, adding two additional rooms a few years later. This building served the town for 13 years before the district demolished it in 1889. In 1881, the district used money from a bequest to construct the Van Loan Memorial School Building. It was designated for children in the lower grades who lived south of the railroad tracks in Seneca. There were five graduates of this school in its first year. Classes were held there until 1890. In 2003, the Van Loan Building was demolished by a fire. In 1889, the district started building the Seneca Public High School; it opened on April 28, 1890. The high school was made of pressed brick, and it was heated by steam. It was large enough to accommodate all the pupils in the Nemaha Valley District as well as pupils from other parts of the county. In 1937, crowded conditions at the high school prompted plans for a new Seneca Grade School. The new grade school was finished in 1938, and it contained eight classrooms, an office, a stage, an auditorium / gymnasium, and a vocational shop and classroom. The building was planned so the district could add wings to accommodate future expansion. In February 1939, a cornerstone containing a copper box time capsule was placed on the southeast corner of the building. The grade school opened for grades 1-6 in August 1939. In 1965, the State of Kansas started unifying small county school districts into larger school districts. The Seneca School District was combined with towns of Kelly, Kansas, and Corning, Kansas, into Unified School District No. 442. In 1966, the new school board selected the name Nemaha Valley for the new school district. According to Earl McGee, the superintendent of school, ‚ÄúMy suggestion would be ‚ÄòNemaha Valley Schools‚Äô since the valley starts at Corning and runs past Kelly and Seneca.‚Äù On December 14, 1966, the Seneca Public High School was condemned. From 1967 to 1969, high school classes were held at the City Hall building, the Masonic Temple, and at the Seneca Grade School. Several bond issues to build a new school failed to pass election. Much of the disagreement centered around the location of the new high school. Some supported a central location for the three towns, while others favored building it in Seneca. In 1968, this disagreement eventually led to Corning transferring to the Centralia, Kansas school district. After Corning left the Nemaha Valley District, the high school bond issue specifying a new Nemaha Valley High School at Seneca passed. The old Seneca Public High School was demolished on July 1, 1968. In 1969 the new Nemaha Valley High School opened for classes. During this same year, Kelly High School was closed, and its students attended NVHS. In March 1970, Nemaha Valley High School was dedicated. In 1974, Saints Peter and Paul High School closed. In 1979, Kelly Junior High closed, and in 1981, Kelly grade school closed. During this time, a new Onida grade school and high school and Bern High school opened in the district. This addition of students required expansion of the buildings. In 1983, the north wing on the grade school was added, and in 1993, the west wing of the grade school was added. The north wing is now the junior high. The west wing primarily houses elementary grade classes. On March 10, 2007, the old section of Seneca Grade School was destroyed in a fire. For the remainder of the school year, classes were held in the public library annex in the basement of Bowman Law Office and Dental Practice, at the former restaurant Bob‚Äôs Sirloin, and at the high school. A bond issue to build a new grade school and junior high school passed in November 2007. The new school was to be located south of the high school. Nemaha Central USD 115 formed in 2011 by the consolidation of Nemaha Valley USD 442 and B&B; USD 451. On May 2014, state budget cuts resulted in closing of the neighboring B and B High School in Baileyville, Kansas. Those students were transferred to Nemaha Valley High School. This prompted a school renaming the preceding year, with students in grades 7 through 11 at Baileyville, students in grades K through 11 in Nemaha Valley, and students in Saints Peter and Paul Catholic School voting to change the name to Nemaha Central. The mascot was renamed the Thunder, and the new school colors were purple and Columbia blue. In August 2014, the school opened its doors as Nemaha Central. This also prompted changing the district number from 442 to 115.

It can be made from milk and lime, generally with pigments added for color. In other recipes, borax is mixed with milk's casein protein in order to activate the casein and as a preservative. Milk paint has been used for thousands of years. It is extremely durable, often lasting for hundreds of years if protected from the elements. It is made of all-natural ingredients, and is very safe and non-toxic once applied. Because oil base and acrylic paints are made in vast quantities using cheap petrochemicals, their price can be low relative to the price of milk paint, which is sold in small quantities. Another impediment to using milk paint for some is that it does not come pre- mixed. Milk paint is commonly sold in the powder form, which is a combination of casein and lime. Once water is added, the lime activates the casein and yields a durable but caustic paint that can be used only on porous surfaces. Before the invention of acrylics, most house paints were made from casein. There is a vast number of historical production documents that outline the manufacture of milk paint on an industrial scale. This type of manufacturing is being revived on a small scale, so that the advantages of an all natural paint can be combined with the convenience of a ready made paint that requires no mixing. Milk paint made from the borax casein recipe keeps for six months or more, if sealed very tightly to retain the moisture. With time, however, the casein binder will break down. Once lime casein milk paint has been mixed, it must be used within a day, or a little longer if refrigerated.  Uses  Milk paint can be used to create authentic reproductions and replicas of antique furniture, or modern pieces that do not rely on any connection with the past.Terri McGraw Additional Tips: Milk Paint Prime Painting Tips Tuesday, September 29, 2009 Central Florida News 13 See also *Casein paint *Painting and the environment References Category:Milk Category:Paints Category:Environmental impact of paint ","title":"Milk paint"},{"id":"24689162","text":"The Soria Moria Hotel in Oslo The Soria Moria declaration is a Norwegian political statement forming the basis of Jens Stoltenberg's second and first government.

Life Agafia was the daughter of Svyatoslav III Igorevich and his wife Yaroslava Rurikovna, a daughter of prince Rurik Rostislavich of Belgorod. Between 1207 and 1210, Agafia arrived in Poland to marry Konrad I of Masovia. The marriage was for political reasons, as her father had become an ally of Leszek I the White and wanted to improve relations with the Polish nobility. Agafia and Konrad were married for at least thirty years. Agafia was very supportive of bringing about the draft of the Teutonic Order. These efforts were successful and in 1227 the couple were greeted by Herman Balka, who brought the first knights. In 1239 there was a crime that involved Agafia's family. It started when their son Casimir married Constance, daughter of Henry II the Pious. John Heron, who had been good to the family and had educated Agafia and Konrad's sons, had shown disobedience towards Casimir after his marriage to Constance, John probably also disapproved over Konrad's rule in Plock. John was found guilty and put to death. He was tortured and then had a public hanging. Jan D≈Çugosz wrote: \\"And when he died his body was removed from the gallows and several brothers of a Dominican took him away to be buried. Since Agafia was involved in the conviction, she is now considered so blood thirsty, she became known as the second Jezebel. John was not buried, Agafia and Konrad had him hung in the Cathedral of Plock. The couple were also said to be cursed by Archbishop of Gniezno. The news of the murder spread rapidly across the country. Archbishop Pelka placed a curse on Conrad and Agafia and laid an interdict on Masovia. The church bells were silent over Masovia and the citizens did not go to celebrate mass; there were also no funerals or weddings. Conrad was now running out of friends and had lost the faith of his subjects.

CSF Corporation. February 20, 2017. 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888. Area code 822 is expected to be used in the future, followed by 880 through 887, then 889. However, 811 is reserved as a three- digit number for various other purposes. In addition, 899 is reserved as a member of the series x9x for future numbering plan expansion. Calls to these numbers are free to the caller if dialed from land-line phones, but may incur mobile airtime charges for cellular phones. History Most of the United States and all of Canada uses a flat-rate structure for local calls, which incur no per-call cost to residential subscribers. As regulators in North America had long allowed long-distance calling to be priced artificially high in return for artificially low rates for local service, subscribers tended to make toll calls rarely and to keep them deliberately brief. Some businesses, eager to sell their products to buyers outside the local calling area, were willing to accept collect calls or installed special services, such as Zenith number service, where they paid the cost of receiving telephone enquiries. Initially, all of these calls had to be completed by the switchboard operator. The first automated toll-free numbers were assigned with area code 800, created as inbound Wide Area Telephone Service (InWATS) in 1966 (U.S. intrastate) and 1967 (interstate). These terminated on special fixed-rate trunks which would accept calls from a specified calling area with either no limit or a specific maximum number of hours per month. The billing of calls was not itemized and the expensive fixed-rate line was only within financial reach of large corporations and government agencies. Typically, a service provider offered a variety of zones, each costing more than the smaller ones, but adding progressively larger areas from which calls would be accepted for a customer. In the early 1980s, Bell Labs received a patent for what became AT&T;'s \\"Advanced 800 Service\\", a computer-controlled system where any toll- free number could point to any destination number, such as to a small business local number instead of a special InWATS line, and an itemized bill generated only for the calls the business actually received. By breaking the link between the number's exchange prefix and geographic location, this system opened opportunities for vanity number advertising ‚Äì an advantage in media like commercial radio where numbers need to be memorable. The toll-free long distance market was opened to competition after 1986 and a RespOrg system instituted in 1993 to provide toll-free number portability between rival carriers using the SMS/800 database. Open competition also brought an end to the pattern of long distance subsidizing local service, bringing per-minute charges down to levels where any business could afford to take orders using an 800-number. Originally, 800-services were isolated between the US and Canada, but in 1984, an agreement between carriers in the two countries allowed the numbers in each country to be accessible to the other; providers of 800 service were able to add zones to cover the expanded areas able to be offered. The arrival of Advanced 800 Service meant that numbers originally limited for use in Canada became available to American customers, and vice versa. Operation The original 800-code operated for over thirty years before its 7.8 million possible numbers were depleted, but new toll-free area codes are being depleted at an increasing rate both by more widespread use of the numbers by voice-over-IP, pocket pagers, residential, and small business use, and widespread abuse by RespOrgs and subscribers who stockpile the numbers for use in misdial marketing, response tracking for individual advertisements (each ad from each client gets a different freephone number) or sale, lease or shared use. Brokering numbers for sale is illegal, but renting a number or part of a number circumvents these regulations as FCC enforcement is sporadic to minimal. Some geographic area codes are similar to the toll-free codes, e.g., 801, 818, 860. Such similarities have been exploited by fraudsters in international locations that can be direct-dialed with what appear at first glance to be domestic area codes, including 809, 829, and 849, which are official prefixes for the Dominican Republic and 876 which is the area code for Jamaica. Toll-free numbers are also sometimes confused with 900-numbers, for which the telephone company bills the callers at rates far in excess of long-distance service rates for services such as recorded information or live chat. These toll-free numbers can normally be called from any phone in Canada or the U.S., though the owner (and sometimes the provider) can put restrictions on their use. Sometimes they accept calls only from either Canada or the U.S., or even only from certain states or provinces. Some are not accessible from pay phones. Calls from pay phones assess the toll-free owner an additional fee in the U.S. as mandated by the FCC. Although toll-free numbers are not accessible internationally, many phone services actually call through the U.S., and in this case the toll-free numbers become available. Examples of these services are the MCI Worldphone international calling card and any US-based Internet telephone gateway. However, many calling card services charge their own fee when their toll-free numbers are used to make calls or when their toll-free numbers are used from pay phones. From many countries (such as the U.K.), U.S. toll-free numbers can be dialed, but the caller first gets a recorded announcement that the call is not free; in fact, on many carriers, the cost of calling a 'toll-free' number can be higher than that of calling a normal number. U.S. toll-free numbers could at one time be accessed from certain other countries (such as Mexico) on a paid basis by replacing the 800 by 880, 888 by 881, and 877 by 882. Thus, to reach 1-800-xxx-yyyy from a country outside its toll-free coverage area, 1-880-xxx- yyyy could be dialed. This is no longer true; area codes 880, 881 and 882 have since been reclaimed for future use. In addition, U.S. toll-free numbers may be accessed free of charge regardless of the caller's location by some IP telephone services. Operator handling In the United States, both interexchange carriers (IXCs) such as Sprint, AT&T; Inc., and Verizon, and Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) such as Verizon and AT&T; offer toll-free services. The way that a toll-free number is handled depends on whether it is a domestic or an interexchange call. Most countries are divided into regions called exchanges, and within each exchange a local telephone company handles all phone services. Intraexchange calls, which do not leave the individual region, would be managed by the individual local telephone company. Calls that cross U.S. LATA boundaries, or originate in one country and terminate in another, are referred to as inter-exchange calls. The format of the toll-free number is called a non-geographic number, in contrast to telephone numbers associated with households that are geographic. (Since the advent of cell phones and voice over IP, households can have any area code in the U.S., but it is still geographic in the sense that calls from that area code are considered local, but the recipient can be physically anywhere). In the latter case, it is possible to determine an approximate location of the caller from the area code (e.g. New York or London). In contrast, toll-free numbers could be physically located anywhere in the world. When a toll-free number is dialed, the phone company must determine where the actual physical destination is, which is achieved by using the intelligent network capabilities embedded into the network. In the simplest case, the toll-free number is translated into a regular geographic number, which is then routed by the telephone exchange in the normal way. More complicated cases may apply special routing rules in addition such as Time of Day routing. Toll-free numbers are normally specific to each country. Canadian numbers are an exception as they are drawn from the same SMS / 800 pool as other North American Numbering Plan countries; the +800 Universal International Freephone Number is an exception as these work from multiple country codes. The arbitrary distinctions between Local Exchange Carrier / Interexchange carrier, intrastate / interstate and the LATA structure are artificial U.S. regulatory constructs which do not have direct parallels in Canada or any other nation. Routing in the U.S. The IXCs generally handle traffic crossing local access and transport area (LATA) boundaries. A LATA is a geographical area within the U.S. that delineates boundaries of the LEC. LECs can provide local transport within LATAs. When a customer decides to use toll-free service, they assign a Responsible Organization (RespOrg) to own and maintain that number. The RespOrg can be either the IXC that is going to deliver the majority of the toll-free services or an independent RespOrg. When a toll-free number is dialed, each digit is analyzed and processed by the LEC. The toll-free call is identified as such by the service switching point (SSP). The SSP is responsible for sending call information to the service control point (SCP), routing the request through at least one signal transfer point (STP) in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network. SS7 is a digital out-of-band method of transmitting signalling (call control) information in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The SS7 network is a packet-switched network carrying signaling data (setup and tear down of the call and services) separate from the circuit-switched bearer network (the payload of the telephone call) in the AIN services network. The SSP asks the SCP where to send the call. The LEC will determine to which IXC that number is assigned, based on the customer's choice. Toll-free numbers can be shared among IXCs. A customer may do this for disaster recovery or so they can negotiate a better price. For example, a customer may assign 50% of their traffic to Sprint and 50% to AT&T.; Once the LEC determines to which IXC to send the call, it is sent to the IXCs point of presence (POP). The IXCs SCP must now determine where to send the call. Once the final determination of where the call is supposed to go is completed, the call is then routed to the subscriber's trunk lines. In a call center or contact center environment, the call is then typically answered by a telephone system known as an automatic call distributor (ACD) or private branch exchange (PBX). The subsequent routing of the call may be done in many ways, ranging from simple to complex depending on the needs of the owner of the toll-free number. Some of the available options are: ;Time-of-Day (TOD) routing: An example of using TOD routing would be a company with a call center on the east coast and a call center on the west coast. TOD routing would enable Follow the Sun routing. The east coast center opens first and calls are sent to that destination earlier in the day. As the time changes across the country, expanded coverage would be offered by the call center in the west. ;Day of Week (DOW) or Day of Year (DOY) routing: Depending on the day of the week and business practices, not all call centers operate 24√ó7. Some centers may be closed for weekends or holidays. DOW routing allows alternate routing for calls that arrive on specific days. DOY routing allows for alternate routing on fixed holidays (example December 25). ;Area Code or Exchange routing: Toll-free traffic may also be routed depending upon the location of the caller. For instance, if a company has call centers in the north and in the south, they may express a preference to have their southern callers speak with people in the southern call centers. Companies may also wish to take advantage of the difference in interstate rates versus intrastate rates. For example, the cost of a telephone call across multiple states may be less expensive than a call within a state, and as a result, the ability to route a call originating in Michigan to a call center outside Michigan can save a company substantial amounts of money. ;Least-Cost routing: Least-Cost routing is a variant of area code / exchange routing in which an independent RespOrg sends calls via different carriers based on which is least expensive for any given origination point. The RespOrg is not the carrier. A Canadian carrier could be used for Canadian calls and a U.S. carrier for American calls; a user with many inbound local voice over IP numbers in multiple cities could convert toll-free calls on one main toll-free number to local calls in each city where it has a point of presence. ;Percentage Allocation routing: If a company has multiple call centers, the company can choose to route calls across a number of call centers on a percentage basis. For example, an airline with ten call centers may choose to allocate 10% of all incoming traffic to each center. ;All-Trunks-Busy routing: If at a given time a company's trunk facilities can no longer handle the incoming traffic, an alternate destination may be chosen. This assists companies handling unexpected call volumes or during crisis times. ;Ring No Answer Routing: Some carriers have the ability to pull a call back into the network if the call is not answered. This provides for contingency routing for calls that ring and are not answered at the final destination. ;Emergency or Disaster routing: Companies usually have some type of disaster plan to deal with both natural (e.g. floods, fires and earthquakes) and man-made (e.g. bomb threats) emergencies. IXCs can provide alternate destinations should any of these situations occur. ;Take Back and Transfer / Transfer Connect / Agent Redirect: If a company uses an ACD to facilitate the transfer, the ACD will remain in the call as long as the parties are on the phone. The drawback is that this uses up trunk capacity on the ACD (or VRU). This is called by a number of names including hair-pinning or tromboning. IXCs have the capability to allow a company to answer a call, provide a level of service, and then transfer the call to another location. These IXC features provide a level of transferring that is different from what is available via the ACD. There is usually a feature charge associated with this offering. All of the above routing features are sometimes referred to as static routing features. These routes are put in place and are not usually changed. If changes are required, a customer usually has several options to make changes. A customer can call the IXC or an independent RespOrg directly via a special toll-free number to make changes, or a customer may be able to make changes through direct access to the network via a dedicated terminal provided by the IXC.  Assignment of NANP toll-free telephone numbers  Toll-free telephone numbers in the NANP are regulated by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 52 Section 101. RespOrgs assign the numbers in the SMS/800 database. SMS/800, Inc. administers this database as the Number Administration and Service Center, as a subcontractor for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The SMS/800 database and RespOrg structure are used in the U.S. and Canada. A few specific exchanges remain reserved or are assigned to specific North American Numbering Plan countries which do not draw numbers from the SMS/800 pool: * Some 800-xxx prefixes are reserved for the following areas: ** 800-389 for the Bahamas ** 800-534 for Barbados ** 800-623 for Bermuda ** 800-415, 800-751, and 800-907 for the Dominican Republic ** 800-271 for Trinidad ** 800-855 is reserved for services for deaf or hearing-impaired users; these TTY-related numbers, operated by individual telephone companies, are assigned directly by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA) * Several other prefixes, including 800-484, 800-703, 800-744, and 800-904 are reserved by the FCC. * 1-NPA-911 is forbidden as 9-1-1 is an emergency telephone number. (This is less restrictive than the rules prohibiting all three-digit N-1-1 codes as exchanges in all geographic area codes.) * 1-NPA-555 is reserved in every toll-free area code (except 1‚Äì800) for future information or directory assistance applications References Category:Telecommunications in the United States ","title":"Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan"},{"id":"24689256","text":"Kangbao County () is a county in the northwest of Hebei province, China.

The text survives in at least four 15th-century manuscripts, the archetype Cod. 78 A 11 (Berlin), dated to between 1410‚Äì1419, and three copies,: Heidelberg Cpg 843 Fasc. 3 (15th century); Munich, Staatsbibl., Cgm 598 (late 15th century, after 1467) and St. Gallen, Kantonsbibl., VadSlg Ms. 428 (dated 1488). The treatise describes the alchemical process in terms of Christian mythology. The theme of the book is the analogy of the passion, death and resurrection of the Christ with the alchemical process leading to the lapis philosophorum. The text is one of the most important alchemical works of late medieval Germany. It is not atypically a combination of alchemy and Christian mysticism. Ganzenm√ºller (1956) speculated that the book may have been known to Jakob B√∂hme. The Berlin manuscript contains drawings, some of which re-appear in later (16th century) alchemical works such as the 1550 Rosarium philosophorum. The work became notable among German nobility, who, on the eve of the German Renaissance, showed great interest in alchemy as a fashionable subject while at the same time rejecting occult magic as impious. Ulmannus' work as an explicitly Christian treatment of alchemy could resolve this dilemma and became a prestige possession in 15th century libraries. A revision of Ulmannus' text was prepared in 1433 for Johannes von Bayreuth, the eldest son of Friedrich von Brandenburg. Copies of this survive in MS. Dresden N 110 (dated 1492) and MS Gotha Landesbibliothek Ch. B. 254 (17th century). Other versions of the work are found in German National Museum Nuremberg MS 80061, John Rylands Library MS Germ 1, The Wellcome Institute, London, MS. 164, and other sources.

The state park contains many mature specimens of western red cedar, Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock, some of the largest on Whidbey island, including a giant cedar over 500 years old.  History  When the park was created in 1974 it consisted of approximately 87 acres of shoreline along Puget Sound. In 1977 local citizens filed a lawsuit against the Washington Department of Natural Resources, which managed the park, when they learned that the state agency planned to grant logging contracts on an adjacent 267 acre parcel of land known as \\"Classic U,\\" which contained one of the few remaining stands of old-growth conifers on the island. Activists pursued legal solutions to prevent logging of the parcel, forming a nonprofit foundation called Save the Trees and seeking a temporary injunction on logging from the state government. Many also practiced civil disobedience‚Äîlaying down in front of bulldozers to prevent the destruction of ancient trees. After many years of negotiation and litigation, 255 acres of the Classic U parcel were officially added to the state park system by action of the legislature. In 1992, the parcel was officially purchased from the DNR and added to South Whidbey State Park. In 2006 an additional 7.3 acre parcel was added to South Whidbey State Park, bringing the total acreage to 347. This land, known as the \\"Ryan addition\\" in honor of local conservationists Al and Maureen Ryan, who were instrumental in the battle to preserve the Classic U groves from logging, was purchased with funds contributed by the state Parks and Recreation Commission, the Island County Commission, and private donors in an effort organized by the non-profit Whidbey Camano Land Trust. In 2015 the campground and overnight use of the park closed indefinitely due to dangerous conditions from ‚Äúadvanced levels of heart rot in the stems of large old-growth trees.‚Äù  Amenities  Park activities include picnicking, hiking on of trails, camping, crabbing, clamming, fishing, swimming, beachcombing, birdwatching, and wildlife viewing.

Essentially a credit broker links somebody looking for consumer credit, a debtor with a company or individual willing to provide it, a creditor, normally for a commission. Credit brokers include mortgage brokers and loan brokers. The commission normally comes from the individual or institution offering credit, and the broker is therefore not entirely objective. Some credit brokers also levy a separate charge on the person looking for credit, without the knowledge of the offering institution.Goode (1978) p.16 In British law, credit brokers are covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Consumer Credit Act 2006, which defines a credit broker not just as a mortgage or loan broker, but also as a vast range of other intermediary bodies such as car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for hire-purchase agreements and solicitors who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. Under the 1974 Act, such businesses require licenses from the Office of Fair Trading.Goode (1979) p.347 If the business is unlicensed, any agreements made are considered \\"tainted\\".

The club is affiliated to Cork GAA and is part of the Imokilly division. Currently, the club fields teams in hurling and camogie, with no Gaelic football teams. History The club was founded in 1928. It was predominantly a Junior B hurling club for much of its early existence, winning an East Cork B hurling championship in 1947. It did on occasion sporadically enter teams in the East Cork football championship in its earlier years, with little success. In 1960 the club became a sister club to the Gaelic football club in the parish, Glenville. Watergrasshill would send its footballers to play for Glenville and in return, Glenville would send its hurlers to play for Watergrasshill. In 1968 the club won its second East Cork Jr B title and regraded to Junior A for the following season. Within 5 years the club had captured its first East Cork Junior A championship in 1974 and followed it up later that year by winning the Cork County Junior A hurling title beating Charleville in the final 3.08 to 0.10. This was the first county championship ever won in the parish. Between 1975 and 1981 the club competed in the Cork Intermediate hurling championship and reached the semifinals in 1978. The club regraded in 1982 back to Junior A and competed in and lost East Cork Jr A finals in 1982, 1985 and 1995. Since the late '70s the club has owned its own facilities in Condonstown Watergrasshill, the facilities are named after prominent club man Felix Sarsfield who did massive work in running the club throughout its early existence, and the venue hosted the 1993 East Cork Junior A hurling final. In the 1990s, considerable effort was put into underage hurling in the parish through both national schools and through a newly formed and well run juvenile hurling club. Many underage titles were won during the'90s and 2000s and the club often competed at the highest grades of juvenile hurling in Cork. This commitment to juvenile hurling was to reap dividends in the new millennium as the club entered its most successful era. In 2000 the club won its second East Cork Junior A championship and followed this up 3 seasons later with its third East Cork Junior A championship in 2003. The club was promoted back to the intermediate grade for the 2004 season. The 2004 season was to be the greatest season in the club's history. Complete outsiders at the beginning of the campaign the team surprised many by going on an incredible run and defeating Bandon & Kilbrittin, drawing with Bandon (who had regrouped and availed of the new 2cd chance system), defeating Bandon in the replay and defeating Nemo Rangers in the county semi-final and setting up a county final date with North Corkmen Dromina. On a wet and windy October Sunday, Watergrasshill were crowned Cork County intermediate hurling champions on a scoreline of 2.13 to 2.08 amid huge celebrations. The club was promoted to the Premier intermediate hurling championship in 2005 and has played at this high level since. In 2007 the club reached the final of this grade before losing to Carrigtwohill in a classic on a scoreline of 3.14 to 3.12. Since the early 1970s the club has fielded a second team that usually plays in the East Cork Junior B hurling championship but has on occasion played in the East Cork Junior A championship. This second team has won East Cork Junior B championships in 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2018. The 2018 triumph was followed later in the year by winning the Cork County Junior B hurling championship defeating Mallow in the final by 2.16 to 3.11. The club continues to thrive and its main aim is to promote hurling in the parish. Plans are underway to purchase and construct new playing facilities while on field the club is continuing its aim of attaining senior hurling status.

Byrd Jr. of Virginia‚Äîwas a 1971 amendment to the U.S. Federal Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. It prohibited the US government from banning the importation of any strategic material from a non-communist country as long as the importation of the same materials from communist countries was also not prohibited. While it did not single out any particular country, it had the effect‚Äìintended by its sponsors‚Äìof creating an exception in the United States embargo of Rhodesia to enable the import of chromite ore from that country. Harry F. Byrd Jr., United States Senator from Virginia, proposed the amendment, which came to bear his name. Rhodesia, run by a mostly white minority government, was unrecognised internationally and under a United Nations-led trade boycott from 1965 following its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain. Prior to the boycott, about 40 percent of US chrome came from Rhodesia, another 40 percent from the Soviet Union and the remaining 20 percent from South Africa, Turkey, Iran and elsewhere. Rhodesia had about 67 percent of the world's reserves of chromium, which is a key component of stainless steel. The United States had formerly been a major importer of Rhodesian chrome, acquiring $5 million worth in 1965, but ceased all imports following the imposition of sanctions. The loss of imports from Rhodesia led to the Soviet Union's share of US chrome imports reaching a peak of 69 percent by 1968. This situation was seen as undesirable in the light of Cold War considerations and was also opposed by an American network of pro-Rhodesian lobbyists and Congressmen, supported by American industrial concerns such as Union Carbide which stood to gain financially from a resumption in Rhodesian imports. The Byrd Amendment, despite breaching UN sanctions, was passed by the United States Congress to permit a resumption of Rhodesian chrome imports from January 1, 1972. It was signed by President Richard Nixon on November 17, 1971. The amendment enabled the resumption of trading not just in chrome but also in nickel and asbestos, with the US importing $13.3 million worth of the three commodities in 1972. Even though the amendment was declared a violation of international law by Diggs v. Schultz in 1972, the chrome trade continued; by 1976 Rhodesia was estimated to be supplying 17 percent of US imports of chrome. The ongoing violation of sanctions attracted widespread condemnation and damaged relations with black African countries. US liberals and civil rights groups also opposed it, but the Nixon administration was indifferent towards their views. The Gerald Ford administration took a mildly opposed stance, with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger criticising the amendment in a speech given in the Zambian capital Lusaka, but did little to try to reverse it. An attempt by congressional liberals to repeal the amendment was defeated in 1975 by a margin of 187 votes to 209. Despite the opposition and the legal findings against the amendment, it was not repealed until March 1977, when newly elected President Jimmy Carter successfully pushed Congress to do so. The Ford administration had finally turned against the amendment in its last few months in 1976 and called for it to be repealed. The success of Carter's administration in persuading Congress to go along with this was due to a significant degree to a collapse in industry support for the amendment, as it had had the side effect of letting in more ferrochrome than raw chromium and caused the collapse of half of the American ferrochrome industry. The Rhodesian government sought to put a brave face on the loss of the American market, announcing that it would have little economic impact, but it had a significant impact on the morale of the white minority government.

Biography Louis Antoine and younger brother Charles Ferdinand, 1781. Sophie d'Artois was born at the Palace of Versailles during the reign of her paternal uncle, Louis XVI. Her father was Charles Philippe de France, known as the comte d'Artois. Her mother was Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy, third daughter of Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia of Spain. She was known as Mademoiselle ‚Äì a very prestigious style of address which was given to the most senior unmarried princess at the court of Versailles. Sophie was also titled Mademoiselle d‚ÄôAngoul√™me and Mademoiselle d'Artois ‚Äì the former reflecting the Duke of Angoul√™me which was the title of her brother Louis Antoine d'Artois. Artois was derived from her father's Appanage of the County of Artois. Her father, as a son of Louis, Dauphin of France, held the rank of Grandson of France. Louis XVI declared that his niece and her siblings would be regarded as Grandchildren of France, despite not being born to a King or Dauphin of France. This rank of Grandchild, which immediately followed the Children of France allowed Sophie to use the style of Royal Highness, but she was always known as Mademoiselle. Sophie died at the Palace of Versailles at the age of seven. She was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris, the traditional burial place of Bourbon royalty. Portraits of Sophie and her family exist at Versailles, one of them being by the famous √âlisabeth- Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun.

The screenplay by Jean-Claude Tramont focuses on the effect that extensive cosmetic surgery has on the life of a middle-aged married woman. Plot In a desperate attempt to save her faltering marriage, 55-year-old Barbara Sawyer submits to full-body plastic surgery in a Swiss clinic, then checks into an exclusive ski resort Cortina d'Ampezzo to await the arrival of her attorney husband Mark. Reveling in her considerably younger and tauter appearance, she allows playboy Erich to seduce her. When Mark finally arrives, he makes an announcement that changes Barbara's initial plans forever. Cast *Elizabeth Taylor as Barbara Sawyer *Henry Fonda as Mark Sawyer *Helmut Berger as Erich *Keith Baxter as David Critical reception The film's critical reception was reasonably favorable, particularly for Taylor, who was nominated for a Golden Globe. Rex Reed's review in The New York Observer amounted to a love letter to Taylor: \\"She's subtle, sensitive, glowing with freshness and beauty, fifty pounds lighter in weight, her hair is coiffed simply, her clothes ravishing, her make-up a symphony of perfection. For those who grew up in love with Elizabeth Taylor, the movie is pure magic. She is once again the kind of star marquees light up for.\\" Variety agreed: \\"Taylor, fashionably gowned and bejeweled carries the film almost single-handedly. Fonda is excellent in his climactic appearance, an unusually superb casting idea. Taylor's performance also is very good, and relative to many of her recent roles, this is one of the strongest and most effective in some time. Her Beauty remains sensational.\\"Variety review Vincent Canby of The New York Times added a dissenting voice, saying the film \\"was directed by Larry Peerce...and written by Jean-Claude Tramont with all the fearlessness and perception demanded in the boiling of an egg.\\"New York Times review Roger Dooley of The Village Voice disagreed, thinking the film \\"Elizabeth Taylor's best role in years...Jean- Claude Tramont's screenplay, directed by Larry Peerce, makes one remember why millions of people used to enjoy movies.\\"Village Voice Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote \\"The movie's story is not really very interesting, but we're intrigued because the star is Taylor. She's 40 or 41 now, and yet she looks great. There's a kind of voyeuristic sensuality in watching her look at herself in the mirror (which she spends no end of time doing)...Maybe the fundamental problem with the movie is that we can't quite believe any man would leave Elizabeth Taylor. It's a good thing we never see Henry Fonda's bimbo, because if we did, we wouldn't be convinced.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Awards and nominations Elizabeth Taylor was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama.
