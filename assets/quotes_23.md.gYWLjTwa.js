History The Whitby Gazette was founded on 6 July 1854 by Ralph Horne, a local printer, bookseller, stationer, bookbinder, paperhanger and shipowner, who was also a member of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society. It was originally published as the Whitby Gazette: Horne's List of Visitors, and was little more than a list of visitors to the seaside town. However, on 2 January 1858, it became a proper twice-weekly newspaper, published on Tuesday and Friday each week. On the death of Ralph Horne in 1892, his two sons, H. S. \\"Mr Harry\\" Horne and F. W. \\"Mr Fred\\" Horne had taken over as Editor and Chairman respectively. In 1920, \\"Mr Harry\\" Horne retired and one of \\"Mr Fred\\" Horne's sons, William Mackenzie Horne, took over the editorship between the wars. In 1949, \\"Mr Fred\\" Horne died thereby relinquishing the Chairmanship, and William Mackenzie's son, L. M. \\"Mr Lionel\\" Horne, took over the running of the entire business. The Gazette stopped being privately owned by the Horne family on 30 March 1978, when Lionel Horne, the great grandson of Ralph Horne, died. The Gazette briefly experimented with a paywall, but this was quickly abandoned as the number of subscribers remained low. The Gazette was re-launched as weekly edition in January 2012 and the paper is now published on a Friday. It is published by Yorkshire Regional Newspapers Ltd, part of Johnston Press. Editor: Ed Asquith Editorial Director since 2003 (previously editor 1996-1998) The Whitby Gazette is the only newspaper in the world to have been read on the highest mountain on each of the seven continents, thanks to the efforts of mountaineer Alistair Sutcliffe, who lives in a village near to the seaside port. Lewis Carroll's first ever published literary works, Coronach and the Lady of the Ladle, were published in the Whitby Gazette between 1854 and 1856. Awards In 2011 the editorial team was a finalist in the O2 Media Awards for the Yorkshire and Humber. In 2013 the Gazette was nominated for the 02 Media's Weekly Newspaper of the Year award. In 2014 the newspaper was also JP Weekly Paper of the Year Runner-up.

It is a 15.5‚Äì16 kDa protein that regulates the activities of white blood cells (leukocytes, often lymphocytes) that are responsible for immunity. IL-2 is part of the body's natural response to microbial infection, and in discriminating between foreign (\\"non-self\\") and \\"self\\". IL-2 mediates its effects by binding to IL-2 receptors, which are expressed by lymphocytes. The major sources of IL-2 are activated CD4+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells.  IL-2 receptor  IL-2 is a member of a cytokine family, each member of which has a four alpha helix bundle; the family also includes IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. IL-2 signals through the IL-2 receptor, a complex consisting of three chains, termed alpha (CD25), beta (CD122) and gamma (CD132). The gamma chain is shared by all family members. The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) Œ± subunit binds IL-2 with low affinity (Kd~ 10‚àí8 M). Interaction of IL-2 and CD25 alone does not lead to signal transduction due to its short intracellular chain but has the ability (when bound to the Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunit) to increase the IL-2R affinity 100-fold. Heterodimerization of the Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits of IL-2R is essential for signalling in T cells. IL-2 can signalize either via intermediate-affinity dimeric CD122/CD132 IL-2R (Kd~ 10‚àí9 M) or high-affinity trimeric CD25/CD122/CD132 IL-2R (Kd~ 10‚àí11 M). Dimeric IL-2R is expressed by memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells, whereas regulatory T cells and activated T cells express high levels of trimeric IL-2R.  IL-2 signaling pathways and regulation  The pleiotropic effects of IL-2 are enabled due to the fact that IL-2 signal can be transduced via 3 different signaling pathways; JAK-STAT, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathway. After IL-2 binding to its receptor, cytoplasmatic domains of CD122 and CD132 heterodimerize. This leads to the activation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 which subsequently phosphorylate T338 on CD122. This phosphorylation recruits STAT transcription factors, predominantly STAT5, which dimerize and migrate to the cell nucleus where they bind to DNA. Gene expression regulation for IL-2 can be on multiple levels or by different ways. One of the checkpoints is signaling through TCR, antigen receptor of T-lymphocytes after recognizing MHC-peptide complex. Signaling pathway from TCR then goes through phospholipase-C (PLC) dependent pathway. PLC activates 3 major transcription factors and their pathways: NFAT, NFkB and AP-1. After costimulation from CD28 the optimal activation of expression of IL-2 and these pathways is induced. At the same time Oct-1 is expressed. It helps the activation. Oct1 is expressed in T-lymphocytes and Oct2 is induced after cell activation. NFAT has multiple family members, all of them are located in cytoplasm and signaling goes through calcineurin, NFAT is dephosphorylated and therefore translocated to the nucleus. AP-1 is a dimer and is composed of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. It cooperates with other transcription factors including NFkB and Oct. NFkB is translocated to the nucleus after costimulation through CD28. NFkB is a heterodimer and there are two binding sites on the IL-2 promoter.  Function  IL-2 has essential roles in key functions of the immune system, tolerance and immunity, primarily via its direct effects on T cells. In the thymus, where T cells mature, it prevents autoimmune diseases by promoting the differentiation of certain immature T cells into regulatory T cells, which suppress other T cells that are otherwise primed to attack normal healthy cells in the body. IL-2 enhances activation-induced cell death (AICD). IL-2 also promotes the differentiation of T cells into effector T cells and into memory T cells when the initial T cell is also stimulated by an antigen, thus helping the body fight off infections. Together with other polarizing cytokines, IL-2 stimulates naive CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes while it impedes differentiation into Th17 and folicular Th lymphocytes. Its expression and secretion is tightly regulated and functions as part of both transient positive and negative feedback loops in mounting and dampening immune responses. Through its role in the development of T cell immunologic memory, which depends upon the expansion of the number and function of antigen-selected T cell clones, it plays a key role in enduring cell-mediated immunity.  Role in disease  While the causes of itchiness are poorly understood, some evidence indicates that IL-2 is involved in itchy psoriasis.  Medical use   Pharmaceutical analogues  Aldesleukin is a form of recombinant interleukin-2. It is manufactured using recombinant DNA technology and is marketed as a protein therapeutic and branded as Proleukin. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in several European countries for the treatment of cancers (malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer) in large intermittent doses and has been extensively used in continuous doses. Interking is a recombinant IL-2 with a serine at residue 125, sold by Shenzhen Neptunus.Bloombert BusinessWeek. Last updated March 3, 2014 Shenzhen Neptunus Interlng-H Neoleukin 2/15 is a computationally designed mimic of IL-2 that was designed to avoid common side effects. It is currently being commercialized into a therapeutic.  Dosage  Various dosages of IL-2 across the United States and across the world are used. The efficacy and side effects of different dosages is often a point of disagreement. The commercial interest in local IL-2 therapy has been very low. Because only a very low dose IL-2 is used, treatment of a patient would cost about $ 500 commercial value of the patented IL-2. The commercial return on investment is too low to stimulate additional clinical studies for the registration of intratumoral IL-2 therapy. = United States = Usually, in the U.S., the higher dosage option is used, affected by cancer type, response to treatment and general patient health. Patients are typically treated for five consecutive days, three times a day, for fifteen minutes. The following approximately 10 days help the patient to recover between treatments. IL-2 is delivered intravenously on an inpatient basis to enable proper monitoring of side effects.American Cancer Society. Interleukin-2 (Aldesleukin). Date accessed: 07 Nov 10. A lower dose regimen involves injection of IL-2 under the skin typically on an outpatient basis. It may alternatively be given on an inpatient basis over 1‚Äì3 days, similar to and often including the delivery of chemotherapy. Intralesional IL-2 is commonly used to treat in-transit melanoma metastases and has a high complete response rate.  Local application  In preclinical and early clinical studies, local application of IL-2 in the tumor has been shown to be clinical more effective in anticancer therapy than systemic IL-2 therapy, over a broad range of doses, without serious side effects. Tumour blood vessels are more vulnerable than normal blood vessels to the actions of IL-2. When injected inside a tumor, i.e. local application, a process mechanistically similar to the vascular leakage syndrome, occurs in tumor tissue only. Disruption of the blood flow inside of the tumor effectively destroy tumor tissue. In local application, the systemic dose of IL-2 is too low to cause side effects, since the total dose is about 100 to 1000 fold lower. Clinical studies showed painful injections at the site of radiation as the most important side effect, reported by patients. In the case of irradiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma the five-year disease-free survival increased from 8% to 63% by local IL-2 therapy Toxicity Systemic IL-2 has a narrow therapeutic window, and the level of dosing usually determines the severity of the side effects. In the case of local IL-2 application, the therapeutic window spans several orders of magnitude. Some common side effects: * flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue) * nausea/vomiting * dry, itchy skin or rash * weakness or shortness of breath * diarrhea * low blood pressure * drowsiness or confusion * loss of appetite More serious and dangerous side effects sometimes are seen, such as breathing problems, serious infections, seizures, allergic reactions, heart problems, kidney failure or a variety of other possible complications. The most common adverse effect of high-dose IL-2 therapy is vascular leak syndrome (VLS; also termed capillary leak syndrome). It is caused by lung endothelial cells expressing high-affinity IL-2R. These cells, as a result of IL-2 binding, causes increased vascular permeability. Thus, intravascular fluid extravasate into organs, predominantly lungs, which leads to life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema. Other drawbacks of IL-2 cancer immunotherapy are its short half-life in circulation and its ability to predominantly expand regulatory T cells at high doses. Intralesional IL-2 used to treat in-transit melanoma metastases is generally well tolerated. This is also the case for intralesional IL-2 in other forms of cancer, like nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  Pharmaceutical derivative  Eisai markets a drug called denileukin diftitox (trade name Ontak), which is a recombinant fusion protein of the human IL-2 ligand and the diphtheria toxin. This drug binds to IL-2 receptors and introduces the diphtheria toxin into cells that express those receptors, killing the cells. In some leukemias and lymphomas, malignant cells express the IL-2 receptor, so denileukin diftitox can kill them. In 1999 Ontak was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL).  Preclinical research  IL-2 does not follow the classical dose-response curve of chemotherapeutics. The immunological activity of high and low dose IL-2 show sharp contrast. This might be related to different distribution of IL-2 receptors (CD25, CD122, CD132) on different cell populations, resulting in different cells that are activated by high and low dose IL-2. In general high doses are immune suppressive, while low doses can stimulate type 1 immunity. Low-dose IL-2 has been reported to reduce hepatitis C and B infection. IL-2 has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic viral infections and as a booster (adjuvant) for vaccines. The use of large doses of IL-2 given every 6‚Äì8 weeks in HIV therapy, similar to its use in cancer therapy, was found to be ineffective in preventing progression to an AIDS diagnosis in two large clinical trials published in 2009. More recently low dose IL-2 has shown early success in modulating the immune system in disease like type 1 diabetes and vasculitis. There are also promising studies looking to use low dose IL-2 in ischaemic heart disease.  IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb immune complexes (IL-2 ic)  IL-2 cannot accomplish its role as a promising immunotherapeutic agent due to significant drawbacks which are listed above. Some of the issues can be overcome using IL-2 ic. They are composed of IL-2 and some of its monoclonal antibody (mAb) and can potentiate biologic activity of IL-2 in vivo. The main mechanism of this phenomenon in vivo is due to the prolongation of the cytokine half-life in circulation. Depending on the clone of IL-2 mAb, IL-2 ic can selectively stimulate either CD25high (IL-2/JES6-1 complexes), or CD122high cells (IL-2/S4B6). IL-2/S4B6 immune complexes have high stimulatory activity for NK cells and memory CD8+ T cells and they could thus replace the conventional IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy. On the other hand, IL-2/JES6-1 highly selectively stimulate regulatory T cells and they could be potentially useful for transplantations and in treatment of autoimmune diseases.  History According to an immunology textbook: \\"IL-2 is particularly important historically, as it is the first type I cytokine that was cloned, the first type I cytokine for which a receptor component was cloned, and was the first short-chain type I cytokine whose receptor structure was solved. Many general principles have been derived from studies of this cytokine including its being the first cytokine demonstrated to act in a growth factor‚Äìlike fashion through specific high-affinity receptors, analogous to the growth factors being studied by endocrinologists and biochemists\\". In the mid-1960s, studies reported \\"activities\\" in leukocyte-conditioned media that promoted lymphocyte proliferation. In the mid-1970s, it was discovered that T-cells could be selectively proliferated when normal human bone marrow cells were cultured in conditioned medium obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes. The key factor was isolated from cultured mouse cells in 1979 and from cultured human cells in 1980. The gene for human IL-2 was cloned in 1982 after an intense competition. Commercial activity to bring an IL-2 drug to market was intense in the 1980s and '90s. By 1983, Cetus Corporation had created a proprietary recombinant version of IL-2 (Aldesleukin, later branded as Proleukin), with the alanine removed from its N-terminal and residue 125 replaced with serine. Amgen later entered the field with its own proprietary, mutated, recombinant protein and Cetus and Amgen were soon competing scientifically and in the courts; Cetus won the legal battles and forced Amgen out of the field. By 1990 Cetus had gotten aldesleukin approved in nine European countries but in that year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to approve Cetus' application to market IL-2. This source mentions approval in 9 European countries. The failure led to the collapse of Cetus, and in 1991 the company was sold to Chiron Corporation. Chiron continued the development of IL-2, which was finally approved by the FDA as Proleukin for metastatic renal carcinoma in 1992. By 1993 aldesleukin was the only approved version of IL-2, but Roche was also developing a proprietary, modified, recombinant IL-2 called teceleukin, with a methionine added at is N-terminal, and Glaxo was developing a version called bioleukin, with a methionine added at is N-terminal and residue 125 replaced with alanine. Dozens of clinical trials had been conducted of recombinant or purified IL-2, alone, in combination with other drugs, or using cell therapies, in which cells were taken from patients, activated with IL-2, then reinfused. Novartis acquired Chiron in 2006 and licensed the US aldesleukin business to Prometheus Laboratories in 2010 before global rights to Proleukin were subsequently acquired by Clinigen in 2018 and 2019.

Early career Ralph is first mentioned in 1152, when he received the archdeaconry of Middlesex. He was probably born between 1120 and 1130; of his parentage and nationality we know nothing. The common statement that he derived his surname from Diss in Norfolk is a mere conjecture. Dicetum may equally well be a Latinized form of Dissai, Dicy, or Dizy, place names in Maine, Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne. In 1152 Ralph was already a master of arts and, presumably, he had studied at Paris. His reputation for learning and integrity stood high. He was regarded with respect and favor by Arnulf of Lisieux and Gilbert Foliot, two of the most eminent bishops of their time. Quite naturally, the archdeacon took in the Becket controversy the same side as his friends. By 1164 Ralph had acquired the livings of Aynho, Northamptonshire, and Finchingfield, Essex, and served them both by vicars.Biography of Ralph de Diceto (August, 2016) Although Ralph's narrative is colourless and although he was one of those who showed some sympathy for Becket at the council of Northampton in 1164, his correspondence shows that he regarded the archbishop's conduct as ill-considered and that he gave advice to those whom Becket regarded as his chief enemies. Ralph was selected in 1166 as the envoy of the English bishops when they protested against the excommunications launched by Becket. But, apart from this episode, which he characteristically neglects to record, he remained in the background. The natural impartiality of his intellect was accentuated by a certain timidity, which is apparent in his writings no less than in his life. Dean of St Paul's About 1180 Ralph became dean of St Paul's. In this office, he distinguished himself by careful management of the estates, by restoring the discipline of the chapter, and by building at his own expense a deanery house. A scholar and a man of considerable erudition, he showed a strong preference for historical studies; and about the time when he was preferred to the deanery he began to collect materials for the history of his own times. Ralph's friendships with Richard Fitz Nigel, who succeeded Foliot in the see of London, with William Longchamp, the chancellor of Richard I, and with Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, gave him excellent opportunities of collecting information. Writings Ralph's two chief works, the Abbreviationes chronicorum and the Ymagines historiarum, cover the history of the world from the birth of Christ to the year 1202. The former, which ends in 1147, is a work of learning and industry, but is almost entirely based upon extant sources. The latter, beginning as a compilation from Robert de Monte and the letters of Foliot, becomes an original authority c. 1172 and a contemporary record c. 1181. In precision and fullness of detail the Ymagines are inferior to the chronicles of Roger of Hoveden.Roger's two Gesta were formerly attributed to Benedictus Abbas. Though an annalist, Ralph is careless in his chronology. The documents which he incorporates, while often important, are selected on no principle. He has little sense of style but displays considerable insight when he ventures to discuss a political situation. For this reason, and on account of the details with which they supplement the more important chronicles of the period, the Ymagines are a valuable though a secondary source.

It has two distinct but related meanings: *Historic steam beer produced in California, and in the East at the James River Steam Brewery in Richmond, Virginia from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century; *Modern California common beer, a competition category name for the beer family, which includes steam beers such as Anchor Steam beer. Historic steam beer, popularly associated with San Francisco and the U.S. West Coast, was brewed with lager yeast without the use of true refrigeration (by ice or mechanical means). It was an improvised process, originating out of necessity, perhaps as early as the Gold Rush and at least 1860 in Nevada. It was considered a cheap and low-quality beer, as shown by references to it in literature of the 1890s and 1900s.e.g., Norris, Frank; McTeague; 1899 Modern steam beer, also known as California common beer, was originated by Anchor Brewing Company, which trademarked the term Steam Beer in 1981. Although the modern company has corporate continuity with a small brewery which has made beer since the 1890s, Anchor Steam is a modern craft- brewed lager. The company does not claim any close similarity between its present-day product and turn-of-the-20th-century steam beer. Etymology There have been various explanations for the use of the name \\"steam beer\\". According to Anchor Brewing, the name \\"steam\\" came from the fact that the brewery had no way to effectively chill the boiling wort using traditional means. So they pumped the hot wort up to large, shallow, open-top bins on the roof of the brewery so that it would be rapidly chilled by the cool air blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. Thus while brewing, the brewery had a distinct cloud of steam around the roof let off by the wort as it cooled, hence the name. Another explanation is that the carbon dioxide pressure produced by the 19th-century steam-beer-making process was very high, and that it may have been necessary as part of the process to let off \\"steam\\" before attempting to dispense the beer. It is also possible that the name or brewing process derive from Dampfbier (literally steam beer), a traditional German beer that was also fermented at unusually high temperatures and that may have been known to 19th-century American brewers, many of whom were of German descent; Dampfbier is an ale, however, not a lager. Brewing process German Dampfbier In 19th-century California, not only ice, but even sources of naturally cold water, . California brewers, unfamiliar with brewing ale, found a strain of lager yeast which would ferment at higher temperatures. Final flavors of beer are influenced by the strain of yeast and the fermentation temperature. Lager yeast is best used at temperatures from . Classic lagering of beers takes place over a period of time from weeks to many months at a temperature of . Conversely, ale yeast is best used at temperatures from . Fermentation by ale yeasts produces a beer that has a more distinct flavor. Steam Beer uses bottom fermenting lager yeasts at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinctive flavor profile that includes both ale and lager characteristics. While steam beer is considered a specialty microbrew style of beer today, it was originally a cheap beer made for blue collar workers. Wahl and Heinus's American Handy Book of Brewing and Malting (1902) describes California Steam Beer as ‚Äúa very clear, refreshing drink, much consumed by the laboring classes.‚Äù And while most modern California common beers are all- barley malt, adjuncts were often used in the early days. According to the book, \\"Malt alone, malt and grits, or raw cereals of any kind, and sugars, especially glucose, employed in the kettle to the extent of 33 percent... Roasted malt or sugar coloring is used to give the favorite amber color of Munich beer.\\" In literature Jack London refers to steam beer in his \\"alcoholic memoir\\", John Barleycorn, in a passage explaining how he started drinking in late-1880s San Francisco: :The first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper, according to custom, called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up pins for several hours. The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer. As a budding writer, \\"a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest of honour to a beer bust\\" and was challenged to a drinking contest. :I'd show them, the young rascals.... These unlicked cubs who thought they could out-drink me! Faugh! It was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer... Frank Norris's 1899 novel McTeague, set in San Francisco, sets the stage with a reference to steam beer in its opening paragraph: :It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that day, McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car conductors' coffee-joint on Polk Street. He had a thick gray soup; heavy, underdone meat, very hot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet pudding, full of strong butter and sugar. On his way back to his office, one block above, he stopped at Joe Frenna's saloon and bought a pitcher of steam beer. It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to dinner.... By and by, gorged with steam beer, and overcome by the heat of the room, the cheap tobacco, and the effects of his heavy meal, he dropped off to sleep. When he marries, his wife convinces him to adopt more refined habits: :She broke him of the habit of eating with his knife, she caused him to substitute bottled beer in the place of steam beer, and she induced him to take off his hat to Miss Baker, to Heise's wife, and to the other women of his acquaintance. California Common beer According to the Beer Judge Certification Program, the term California Common beer, is \\"narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example\\", and other commercial examples include Skyscraper Brewing Company Lug Nut Lager, Moab Brewery Rocket Bike Lager, Southampton West Coast Steam Beer, Old Dominion Victory Amber, Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager, Schlafly's Pi Common, Linden Street Common Lager, Eagle Steam Beer and Cosmic Brewing Company Plead the Fifth common lager . The style \\"showcases the signature Northern Brewer hops (with woody, rustic or minty qualities) in moderate to high strength\\", is fermented with \\"a lager yeast, but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of normal ale fermentation temperatures\\", and was traditionally fermented in open fermenters. Other varieties of \\"steam beer\\" Adam Wood Steam Brewery is listed as having been sold in 1859. A British brewery, the Lincolnshire Steam Beer Co., derives its name from the steam-powered brewing machinery. When Canadian brewer Sleeman introduced a product called Steam Beer in Canada in 1999, Anchor sued for trademark infringement, since it had trademarked the term steam beer in Canada ten years earlier. Canadian courts dismissed the suit and subsequent appeals, ruling that Anchor's Canadian trademark was invalid, since the beer had not been marketed in Canada up to that time. After Sapporo bought Sleeman in a $400-million takeover in 2006, Sleeman's production of Steam Beer was discontinued. In Richmond, Virginia the remains of a former Yuengling brewery along the James River were once called David Yuengling Jr.'s James River Steam Brewery and are located at (or near) 912 East Main St. The St. Louis Guide for Citizens and Strangers (1859) shows advertising copy for J.F. Boyd & Co. St. Louis Ale, Porter and Lager Beer Steam Brewery. The 1865 New Orleans City Directory has an advertisement for the Old Canal Steam Brewery, \\"First Lager- Beer Steam Brewery in New Orleans\\", owned by Geo. Merz, next to the Ice House and Lager Beer Cellar. Widmer Brothers Brewery released Columbia Common Beer, a seasonal common ale which is brewed with lager and hefeweizen yeasts and Columbia hops. Derecho Common was issued by the Port City Brewing Company of Alexandria, VA after the power outages related to the June 2012 North American derecho resulted in a tank of Port City's beer fermenting as a steam beer due to loss of refrigeration. Port City has since continued to release Derecho Common. Steam beer may have developed in parallel in North Korea. Due to the scarcity of electricity, a North Korean beer style very similar to steam beer has developed because it does not require refrigeration. California Common is a revered style in the Home Brew community. Many brewing supply shops provide a Steam Beer/ California Common kit, and recipes abound.

Biography Rauf Yekta was born on 27 March 1871, in the Aksaray area of Istanbul, Turkey to his father Ahmed Arif Bey. He was named Mehmed Rauf but adopted Rauf Yekta as a pen name. Rauf Yekta spoke 3 languages: French, Arabic and Persian. He was a government official. Zeliha Han married Rauf Yekta Bey and they had two sons and two daughters. Contribution to the theory of Turkish classical music Yekta wrote the first modern account of Turkish classical music available in a Western language (Raouf Yekta Bey, \\"La musique turque\\", in Encyclopedie de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire, edited by Albert Lavignac, Premi√®re partie, Volume V, pp. 2945‚Äì3064. Paris, 1922). His emphasis in this encyclopedia article was on intervals, modes and rhythms, quoting some 73 musical examples. In the article he introduced a modified European notation. Yekta's system used a variety of accidentals to express the microtonal inflections necessary for the Turkish modal system. This notational system was the one used for the official publications of the Istanbul Conservatory during the 1920s and 1930s. The present-day theory of Turkish classical music is the result of collaboration by Yekta with Dr. Suphi Ezgi (1869‚Äì1962) and H. Sadettin Arel (1880‚Äì1955). Career as a performer Yekta performed often at Mevlevi ceremonies.

Camera and imaging use The monopod allows a still camera to be held steadier, allowing the photographer to take sharp pictures at slower shutter speeds, and/or with longer focal length lenses. In the case of video, it reduces camera shake, and therefore most of the resulting small random movements. Monopods are easier to transport and quicker to set up than conventional tripods, making them preferable for on-the-go (OTG) photography. An OTG photographer is not able to carry a heavy, bulky tripod around, and when he or she sees a potential shot, there is no time to bother with setting up a complicated tripod. A simple monopod is easy to carry, easy to set up, and enables the photographer to take advantage of the situation he or she is presented with, all while providing camera support to capture a clear, sharp image. Examples of situations in which a monopod is preferable include wildlife and sports photography where you can dramatically increase the stability of long lenses, travel photography, particularly around the golden hours and of course outdoor macro photography, especially when trying to photograph insects etc. When used by itself, it eliminates camera shake in the vertical axis. When used in combination with leaning against a large object, a bipod is formed; this can also eliminate horizontal motion. Unlike a tripod, monopods cannot support a camera independently. In the case of still cameras, this limits the shutter speed that can be used. They still allow longer exposures than hand holding, and are easier to carry and use than a tripod. Because it confers less stability than a tripod, monopods may present difficulties when trying to get a good image with very low light photography, i.e. night time, and shots where you need a 100% stable camera for example shooting light trails or landscapes with extreme depth of field. Many monopods can also be used as a \\"beltpod,\\" meaning that the foot of the monopod can rest on the belt or hip of the photographer. This is usually used in selfies for clearer shots by ensuring that the camera is not in motion relative to the body. With a special adapter, monopods can be used as a \\"chestpod\\", meaning that the foot rests now on the chest of the photographer. The result is that the camera is held more steadily than by hand alone (though not as steadily as when the foot is planted on the ground), and the camera/monopod is completely mobile, travelling with the photographer's movements. This technique is widely used in videography in which the photographer has to move with the subject e.g. first-person scenes, and is also especially useful for disabled photographers. Generally, in terms of mobility versus stability, if mobility increases, stability decreases as follows: * Tripod or tablepod resting on a solid surface (most stable) * Monopod on solid surface * \\"Chestpod\\" / \\"Beltpod\\" * Hand-held (least stable) Monopods are often equipped with a ball swivel, allowing some freedom to pan and tilt the camera while the monopod remains relatively stationary. Walking sticks or \\"trekking poles\\" exist that have a 1/4\\"-20 threaded stud on the top of the handle, usually covered by a cap when not in use, allowing them to double as a camera monopod. The user would usually need to carry a ball swivel adapter separately and mount it as needed. Monopods used with a smartphone or camera to take selfie photographs beyond the normal reach of the arm are known as selfie sticks, and (depending on the model) may have Bluetooth connectivity.  Ways of attaching a camera  There are two ways to attach your camera to a monopod. The first is to screw the monopod's screw thread directly into the camera body. This is fine if you're using a fairly small, light lens. If you're shooting using a long, heavy telephoto lens, it's better to use a tripod mount ring. This fixes the monopod to the lens rather than the camera body, giving better balance and stopping the monopod from rotating in your hands as you try to position it. There are various different types of monopod head available, and ball heads offer the most flexibility. They allow you to shoot in portrait or landscape orientation, and angle your camera to adjust for any sloping of the monopod. Firearms A Sako TRG sniper rifle on its standard factory monopod under the butt and its bipod. A monopod can be used for firearms. They have the advantage of being light and compact, although when used in firing mode they can only be used with small firearms. They are also used as \\"butt spikes\\" as a rear support on precision rifles. Precision optical and measuring instruments When used to support a compass or transit, the monopod is referred to as a jacob staff.Rutstrum, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), , pp. 47-55, 64-72 Mounting the compass atop the jacob staff eliminates reading errors introduced by body movements, and permits the taking of more precise bearings to targets.Rutstrum, pp. 47-55, 64-72 Monopods known as finnsticks are also used to steady high-power (typically, 10√ó or more) binoculars to permit a clear view without shake or wobble introduced by the user's hand and body movements. With the introduction of gyroscopically stabilized binoculars, the use of stabilizing supports for binoculars have declined in recent years.

One of a group of composers known as the Turkish Five who pioneered western classical music in Turkey, his works show a mastery of Western musical practice, while also incorporating traditional Turkish folk songs and culture. When alluding to folk elements he tends to spotlight one note of the scale and weave a melody around it, based on a Turkish mode. His extensive output includes five symphonies, five operas, two piano concertos, concertos for violin, viola and cello, and a wide range of chamber and choral works. The Times called him \\"the grand old man of Turkish music, who was to his country what Jean Sibelius is to Finland, what Manuel de Falla is to Spain, and what B√©la Bart√≥k is to Hungary\\".\\"Ahmet Adnan Saygun\\", The Times, 15 January 1991. p. 12 Saygun was growing up in Turkey he witnessed radical changes in his country‚Äôs politics and culture as the reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk had replaced the Ottoman Empire‚Äîwhich had ruled for nearly 600 years‚Äîwith a new secular republic based on Western models and traditions. As Atat√ºrk had created a new cultural identity for his people and newly founded nation, Saygun found his role in developing what Atat√ºrk had begun. Biography Statue of Ahmet Adnan Saygun at Ahmed Adnan Saygun Arts Center Ahmet Adnan Saygun was born in 1907 in ƒ∞zmir, then part of the Ottoman Empire ‚Äì in today's Turkey. There were frequent concerts given by the Ottoman military bands, and performances of Western works by chamber music ensembles at the time and this influenced Saygun to start his first music lessons in elementary school. He started playing the piano, the Ottoman short-necked lute and the oud at an early age and quickly found his passion writing music at the age of fourteen. His father who was a mathematics teacher and scholar of religions and literature taught him English and French as well as world religions at an early age. Through rigorous study Saygun was able to translate the music section of the French Grande Encyclop√©die into a music encyclopedia in Turkish. While in high school, he continued his music lessons with lessons in school as well as from a private teacher and through a theory book which he was given at an early age. In 1926, only two years after his graduation from high school he was appointed as teacher of music at a high school in his native city of ƒ∞zmir. In 1928 he was recognized nationally and received a grant to study in France by the Turkish state. He attended the Schola Cantorum de Paris where he studied composition with Vincent d'Indy, theory and counterpoint with Eug√®ne Borrel, organ with √âdouard Souberbielle and Gregorian chant with Am√©d√©e Gastou√©. He was further introduced to late-romantic music and French impressionism. During this time his imagination flourished, enabling him to write his first large work for orchestra: Divertimento. This piece won him an award in 1931 in Paris and was performed with great success the same year in Poland and former USSR. In 1931 he returned to Turkey as a music teacher for a new establishment found by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk that aimed to train music teachers with respect to the new law of arts. This suggested that previous training standards had to be changed to meet Western musical standards. Musical education adopted Western musical practices as part of this new era in Turkey. In 1934 he was appointed as the conductor of the prestigious Presidential Symphony Orchestra. That very same year Atat√ºrk approached Saygun, asking him to write the first Turkish opera. As Saygun was a huge follower of Atat√ºrk he accepted his offer with great warmth and in two months time finished writing the first Turkish opera, √ñzsoy. The opera's theme was the historical friendship between the peoples of Turkey and Iran. Following √ñzsoy's success Atat√ºrk asked Saygun to write another opera suggesting the heroism of the Turks and Atat√ºrk's devotion to his country and people. Saygun quickly finished his second opera Ta≈übebek in that very same year. This was the year that marked Saygun's career as the musical \\"voice\\" of the newly founded republic of Turkey. He now was the musical symbol of his country and had dedicated his works and life for the people and his country, like his great admirer Atat√ºrk. Following the operas he was neglected in Ankara State Conservatory by its founder Paul Hindemith. He moved to Istanbul as part of the theory faculty at the Istanbul Municipal Conservatory. In 1936 B√©la Bart√≥k visited Turkey to research the native folk music. Saygun accompanied Bart√≥k on his travels around the country, collecting and transcribing folk songs all through the Anatolia and Osmaniye (a region of Adana), Turkey. Saygun gained immense knowledge of Bart√≥k's style of writing during this trip and learned a great deal about string quartets: they became great friends. In 1939 he was invited back to Ankara to further promote Western musical activities and practices. A year later he formed his own organization, Ses ve Tel Birliƒüi, which showcased recitals and concerts throughout the country, further developing public knowledge of Western classical music. Saygun's international acclaim flourished with his oratorio Yunus Emre in 1946. This is an hour-long work written for four vocal soloists, a full chorus and full orchestra that sets a number of poems by the 13th century Anatolian mystic poet Yunus Emre. This work captures Yunus Emre's legacy with the use of Turkish modes and folk melodies, although it is written in the post-romantic style. Since its premiere in Ankara in 1947, the oratorio has been translated into five languages and performed worldwide, including a performance in English at the United Nations led by conductor Leopold Stokowski with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1958. This same year he won the Stella della solidariet√†Account of the event and the Jean Sibelius composition awards. The success of Yunus Emre encouraged Saygun to compose further large- scale works. In the 1950s he wrote three new operas, his first two symphonies, a piano concerto, and several pieces of chamber music pieces, of which a Paris premiere of the first string quartet (1954) and a premiere of the second string quartet (1958) in New York City performed by the Juilliard String Quartet gained him further international exposure. There followed, amongst other works, three more symphonies, concertos for violin and viola and a second piano concerto, and a third string quartet. A fourth quartet remained unfinished at his death. Saygun was known not only as a composer but also as a scholar as he wrote and published many books on the teaching of music. He was also an ethnomusicologist and a teacher. He greatly influenced the development of western music in Turkey and helped to establish several new music conservatories, and was also a member of the National Education Council and the board of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation. Starting in 1972, he taught composition and ethnomusicology at the Istanbul Municipal Conservatory (renamed \\"Turkish Music State Conservatory\\" in 1986) until his death in 1991. Following his death, the Ahmet Adnan Saygun Center for Music Research at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, was founded where his original manuscripts and archives are also kept. His works were played by orchestras such as NBC Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Symphony Orchestra, Munich Philharmonic, Bavarian Radio Orchestra, NDR Radiophilharmonie Hannover and numerous others. The German label CPO has launched a series of works in memoriam of the 100th birthday of the composer in 2007. The records are including Symphonies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Piano Concertos 1, 2, Violin Concerto, Viola Concerto, Cello Concerto, Anatolian Suite and String Quartets 1, 2, 3, 4. Turkish music historian Emre Araci published a comprehensive biography and catalogue of Adnan Saygun in 2001 (Yapƒ± Kredi Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, in Turkish), based on his 1999 PhD thesis from the University of Edinburgh.

Founded in 1676 it was the first purpose-built meeting place for the Quakers anywhere in the world. A V-1 flying bomb landed in Ifield during World War II. It damaged the village school and wounded one local man who remained slightly brain damaged for the rest of his life. Denzil Holles was created Baron Holles of Ifield in 1661, after his part in the restoration of Charles II of England. The peerage became extinct after his grandson died unmarried and without issue. Denzil was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his family are interred here. Education There are five schools in Ifield neighbourhood: * Primary Schools: St.Margaret's Church of England Primary School and Mill Primary Academy * Secondary School: Ifield Community College * Special Schools: Manor Green School and Manor Green College Ifield station Ifield station is located on the south side of the neighbourhood on the border with Gossops Green neighbourhood. The station is part of the Arun Valley line and was opened in 1907 as 'Ifield Halt'. Southern services run to Three Bridges and London Victoria from Platform 1 and Horsham from Platform 2. The level crossing that used to be in operation was replaced by the footbridge that now connects the two platforms. Ifield Village Conservation Area Originally the area around the church was designated a conservation area in 1981 and was later expanded to include Ifield village green, Tweed Lane and Rectory Lane. A further expansion in 2013 added Ifield Green and Langley Lane. Ifield Water Mill and Mill Pond Pond at Ifield, by the mill Ifield Mill Pond lies between Bewbush, Gossops Green and Ifield West. It is the source of the River Mole which runs north to the River Thames above Teddington Lock. In 1683 Ifield Water Mill, a corn mill, was built in the north of the pond; it used water from the mill pond to turn its water wheel. It was rebuilt in 1817 and is now being restored. The restoration has been led by a team of volunteers and spearheaded by Ted Henbery MBE, who has spent 34 years on the project after his son discovered the disused site in 1974. A second project to upgrade the Mill Pond concluded in July 2015 after ¬£6.5 million was spent upgrading the dam, finished ¬£1 million under budget. The Mill Pond is considered to be \\"the most important wetland site in Crawley\\" and supports a rich bird community. Ifield Barn Theatre The theatre is situated in Ifield, to the north of the 13th century church of St Margaret. The theatre buildings were converted from a group of agricultural buildings mainly based on a tithe barn and former Granary.

It was largely developed between the summer of 1972 and fall of 1973, at which point it included shooter elements and soon after was playable over ARPANET between multiple universities. It is considered the earliest first-person shooter; ambiguity over its development timeline has led it to be considered, along with Spasim (March 1974, on PLATO), to be one of the \\"joint ancestors\\" of the genre. Although the first- person shooter genre did not crystallize for many years, Maze War influenced first-person games in other genres, particularly RPGs. The Maze War style view was first adopted by Moria in 1975, an early RPG on the PLATO network, and further popularized by Ultima and Wizardry, eventually appearing in bitmapped form in games like Dungeon Master, Phantasy Star, Eye of the Beholder and countless others. Gameplay is simple by later standards. Players wander around a maze, being capable of moving backward or forwards, turning right or left in 90-degree increments, and peeking around corners through doorways. The game also uses simple tile-based movement, where the player moves from square to square. Other players are seen as their names, figures or later eyeballs in the Xerox version. When a player sees another player, they can shoot or otherwise negatively affect them. Players gain points for shooting other players, and lose them for being shot. Some versions (like the X11 port) had a cheat mode where the player running the server could see the other players' positions on the map. The original MIT Imlac version had cheat keys to knock out a wall in the player's local Imlac maze copy, which made it possible to walk through walls as seen by other players. Occasionally in later versions, a duck also appears in the passage.  Innovations  Features either invented for Maze War or disseminated by it include: *First-person 3-D perspective. Players saw the playing field as if they themselves were walking around in it, with the maze walls rendered in one point perspective. This makes the game one of the first, if not the first first-person shooter. It also could be considered a very early virtual reality system. *Avatars. Players were represented to each other as eyeballs. While some earlier games represented players as spacecraft or as dots, this was probably the first computer game to represent players as organic beings. *Player's position depicted on level map. Representation of a player's position on a playing field map. Unlike the playing field of a side-view or second-person perspective, this is only used for position reference as opposed to being the primary depiction of play. It does not normally depict opponents. The combination of a first-person view and a top-down, second-person view has been used in many games since. *Level editor. A program was written to edit the playing field design. *Network play. Probably the first game ever to be played between two peer-to-peer computers, as opposed to earlier multiplayer games which were generally based on a minicomputer or mainframe with players using either terminals or specialized controls, in 1973. *Client-server networked play. An updated version may well have been the first client-server game, with workstations running the client connecting to a mainframe running a server program. This version could be played across the ARPANET, in 1977. *Observer mode. In the 1974 and 1977 versions, a graphics terminal could be used by observers to watch the game in progress without participating. *Internet play. While not the first game to feature this, it certainly was a very early example running over the early Arpanet. *Modifying clients in order to cheat at the game. *Encrypting source code to prevent cheating.  Versions   1973, Imlacs at NASA  It was originally written by Steve Colley (later founder of nCUBE) in 1972‚Äì1973 on the Imlac PDS-1's at the NASA Ames Research Center in California. He had written a program for portraying and navigating mazes from a first-person perspective. The maze was depicted in memory with a 16 by 16 bit array. Colley, together with Greg Thompson, and Howard Palmer developed the MazeWars program at NASA in Jim Hart's Computation Division 2nd floor lab. Colley writes:  1973, Imlacs at MIT  The original Imlac networked version was limited to two players, with the Imlacs directly cabled to each other. In the fall of 1973, Greg Thompson brought the game with him when he went away to college at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There at J. C. R. Licklider's MIT Project MAC Dynamic Modelling Laboratory, Greg with Dave Lebling expanded Maze Wars into a full multiplayer game that could operate between Imlacs over the early ARPANET (the predecessor to the modern Internet). According to Lebling, the version of the game Thompson brought did not have shooting in it yet: \\"you wandered around in a maze, and that was it.\\" In addition to the network connectivity, they added the shooting, and Lebling wrote a maze editor where players could create mazes with a text file of '1's for walls and '0's for spaces. As described in the history of interactive computing book The Dream Machine: The clients ran on Imlacs which had 56 kbit/s serial connections, allowing them to communicate with a PDP-10 computer running MIT's Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS). A server program on the mainframe coordinated up to eight Imlac clients playing against each other. By using terminal servers, Imlacs at other colleges that were connected to the ARPANET could connect to the server at MIT and play against players located across the United States. The server program would also implement robot players and drive a playing monitor that would display a top-down map of the maze showing the locations of human and robotic players on an Evans & Sutherland LDS-1 Line Drawing System. Later a level editor was written so that different playing fields could have different designs.  1976, TTL at MIT  For a class in the fall of 1976, Greg Thompson (computer design), Mark Horowitz (display processor) and George Woltman (firmware) built a \\"hardware\\" version of Maze entirely from 7400 series TTL circuits, essentially creating a Maze computer with 256 16-bit instructions and 256 bytes of RAM, dedicated solely to playing Maze for up to 4 human players and 4 robots. Arcade games such as Pong had used this approach before. The TTL version of Maze used Tektronix oscilloscopes to display vector graphics. This was natural, since the Imlacs also used vector displays. This version introduced a full third dimension, by having a four-level maze with players able to climb up and down between levels. Robots players were also implemented in the firmware. Their skill level was controlled by simply adjusting the clock rate of the system. The game was so popular that even though it had been built as a MIT 6.111/6.112 class project it was kept assembled and operational for over a year.  1977, Xerox  In 1977, Jim Guyton, a staff member at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) rewrote Mazewar for the Xerox Alto and other Xerox Star machines. This was the first raster display version of Mazewar. It made use of the Alto's Ethernet network, using the Xerox PUP network protocol. The Data General servers used on the network were capable of gatewaying games to remote office locations, allowing people at several Xerox sites to play against each other, making Mazewar capable of being played in four different configurations: peer to peer with two Imlacs, client-server with Imlacs and a PDP-10, in pure hardware, and over Ethernet and PUP. Several programmers at PARC cheated by modifying the code so that they could see the positions of other players on the playing field map. This upset the authors enough that the source code was subsequently stored in an encrypted form, the only program on the system to receive this protection. This is interesting in light of the fact that this laboratory housed many of the most important programming developments of the time, including the first graphical user interfaces.  1986, Digital Equipment Corporation  In 1982, Jim Guyton showed Christopher (Kent) Kantarjiev Mazewar at RAND. Kent later interned at Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Lab (DEC WRL) in Palo Alto during his Ph.D. studies. Several former PARC employees worked at WRL, and one of them, Gene McDaniel, gave Kent a hard copy of the Mesa source code listing from the Xerox version of Maze, and the bitmap file that is used for the display. The X Window System had been newly released as a result of collaborative efforts between DEC and MIT. Kent wrote a networked version of Mazewar, which he released in December 1986. This version used UDP port 1111, and could be played by Unix workstations running X Window across the Internet. This was probably the second game which directly used TCP/IP, and the first which could be played across the Internet (1983's SGI Dogfight used broadcast packets and thus could not transit a router).  1992, Oracle SQL*Net  Using Kent's code and earlier code from MIT, Jack Haverty and others at Oracle created a version of Maze running over Oracle SQL*Net over TCP/IP, Novell SPX/IPX, DECnet, and Banyan Vines at Fall Interop 92 on a number of workstations, including Unix machines from Sun, IBM, and SGI, as well as DEC VMS workstations and MS-Windows. Attendees could play against each other at stations placed throughout the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.  Other versions  * 1982, Snipes by SuperSet Software. This used semaphores in a shared file which resided on a network drive. It was written as a demonstration program for SuperSet's local area network system, which became Novell NetWare. * 1987, MacroMind MazeWars+ for the Apple Macintosh computer. Fully 3D (multiple vertical game levels) and could be played over AppleTalk networks. It was distributed by Apple with new Macintosh computers for some period of time. Later the 1993 title Super Maze Wars by the Callisto Corporation was distributed with some Macintosh computers. * A version has been written for NeXT computers * A version has been written for Palm OS * A version has been written for iPhone and iPod Touch  Retrospective  A 30th anniversary retrospective was hosted by the Vintage Computer Festival held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, on November 7, 2004.

Elected as a member of the Labor Party, she was forced to resign from the party in September 2004 after being booked for driving a car without a licence. This followed an incident earlier in the year when she had lost her licence after being booked by police with an alcohol reading of 0.07, while driving home from an ALP function. She sat as an independent member of the Legislative Council from then until November 2005, when she was re-admitted to the ALP, but was forced to resign a second time on 23 June 2006, after a second drink- driving incident. Early history Hirsh was born in Melbourne, though she attended high school in the rural town of Colac. She trained as a teacher at Geelong Teachers College and then Monash University, where she also studied psychology. After graduating from university, she was employed as a teacher of children with disabilities, and also worked for some years in her family business. She joined the Labor Party in the late 1960s, while involved with the campaign against the Vietnam War. Political career Hirsh worked as a psychologist for the Victorian Department of Education from 1980 to 1985, when she was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for Wantirna. Hirsh was re-elected at the 1988 election, after which she was promoted to the position of Government Whip, but made an unsuccessful attempt to switch to the seat of Knox in 1992. After losing her seat, she returned to private practice as a psychologist. She made two unsuccessful attempts to move to federal politics, as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe at the 1996 election and 1998 election. She taught at the Mountain District Learning Centre, in addition to her practice, from 1996 to 1998, before giving both away in 1999 and taking on a position at the Chisholm Institute of TAFE. In the Labor landslide victory at the 2002 state election, Hirsh won an upset victory in the Legislative Council seat of Silvan Province, which had previously been thought to be a safe Liberal seat. In 2003, she was elected as the chair of the parliamentary Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee. She did not contest the 2006 election. Alcohol problems In June 2004, Hirsh was driving home from a Labor function when she was breath-tested and found to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .07, more than the legal driving limit of .05. Her licence was suspended for six months, and she was forced to resign from the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee. In an odd coincidence, six weeks later, Andrew Olexander, the Liberal member for Silvan Province (there were two members for each Province in the Legislative Council) was also caught drink-driving, and received a similar penalty. On 17 September 2004, Hirsh was again pulled over by police while driving, and was found to be driving while disqualified. The car she was driving also did not have a current registration sticker displayed, which is illegal, and it was reported that she gave police a false name. That night, Premier Steve Bracks publicly demanded that Hirsh quit the party, stating that \\"there is no room in the Labor Party for people who had so openly flouted the law\\". Despite pressure from the Labor Party and the media, Hirsh announced her intention to remain in Parliament as an independent. However, she continued to vote with the Labor Party, and her application in late 2005 to rejoin the Party was accepted. She rejoined on 10 November 2005, saying that the Labor Party is very much a part of \\"who she is\\". In October 2004, Hirsh told The Age newspaper that she had been battling depression, caused by the suicide of her eldest daughter in 2001, and said that while this was not an excuse for her behaviour, it was the reason. On 21 June 2006, she was again found by police to have been driving under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of .065, and was expected to be charged on summons for drink driving. Premier Steve Bracks announced that Hirsh had admitted herself to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, and that he would move to expel her from the Labor Party caucus a second time.ABC News Online (2006). Victorian MP caught drink-driving again. Retrieved 22 June 2006. She resigned from the party on 24 June.ABC News Online (2006). Drink- driving Hirsh quits Labor Party. Retrieved 23 June 2006. On 12 April 2014, Hirsh told The Herald Sun about her battle with alcoholism, which ultimately led to her forced resignation in 2004 from the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee.

Design and development In 1926 the Air Ministry specification N.21/26 was intended to produce a successor to the Fairey Flycatcher, then in its fourth year of Naval service. By the time it was replaced by the Nimrod in 1932, the Flycatcher had become so obsolete in terms of its speed that RAF officers who flew it often joked that a sprightly fly might actually give the aircraft a run for its money. None of the aircraft designed to this specification were selected for production after trials in 1928, but the radial-engined Hawker Hoopoe, not actually designed to N.21/26, was considered promising enough to be further developed. Despite the Navy's traditional preference for radial engines, Hawker's designer Sydney Camm was convinced by his experience with the landplane Hawker Fury that the future for shipborne aircraft also lay with inline engines and began such a design, powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel. Before it was completed Air Ministry specification 16/30 was written around it. It flew under the initial name \\"Norn\\" early in 1930, received a production contract and was renamed Nimrod.Mason 1961, pp. 184‚Äì190. The Nimrod had an overall similarity to the Fury: it was a single-seater biplane with an open cockpit, fixed undercarriage and guns firing through the propeller. Its unswept, constant chord, round-tipped wings had an unequal span and strong stagger, the latter partly to enhance the pilot's view. It was a single bay biplane braced with outward-leaning N-form interplane struts, with the upper plane held a little above the upper fuselage by cabane struts. The fabric- covered wings had metal spars and spruce ribs and carried balanced ailerons only on the upper wings. The Nimrod's fuselage was a Warren girder structure of tubular steel and aluminium, surrounded by stringers which defined its oval cross section. The Rolls-Royce F.9MS engine, later renamed the Kestrel IIMS was closely cowled in aluminium and the rest of the fuselage fabric covered. As with the Fury, the upper fuselage line was highest at the cockpit, placed between the trailing edges of the upper and lower planes. Its twin machine guns were mounted in the upper fuselage between pilot and engine, firing through the propeller using the standard interrupter gear. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried split horn balanced elevators; the vertical tail had Hawker's familiar curved shape, with a deep, wide chord, unbalanced rudder extending to the keel. The Nimrod had a conventional undercarriage of cross axle type on trailing struts, with compression legs almost at right angles to the fuselage and an aft tailskid. It could also operate as a floatplane on single-step, crossbraced floats mounted on N-form struts. With floats fitted, the maximum speed was reduced by 47 mph (76 km/h), or 25%. The Kestrel engine's bath type radiator was mounted on the lower fuselage between the undercarriage struts. After testing in 1930, the prototype went with HMS Eagle to Buenos Aires, flying there as part of the British Empire Trade Exhibition in March 1931. It returned to RAF Martlesham Heath for final testing. A production order for 35 was placed and the first of these flew on 31 October 1931. In the following year, another contract for a further 19 Nimrod Is was signed. With a top speed of 193 mph (311 km/h) it was only marginally slower than its land-based counterpart, the Hawker Fury. A headrest fairing was added retrospectively to the Nimrod Is, to ease pilot strain during catapult launches. Aircraft from the later production batch were fitted with arrestor hooks. Experiments with the first of this batch, refitted with swept upper and lower wings, lead to the Nimrod II. As well as the swept wings, this had at first an uprated Kestrel II engine. Later, these were replaced with Kestrel Vs. Later Nimrod IIs had a slight increase in rudder area to improve spin recovery of inverted, float-equipped aircraft. Originally it was intended that the Nimrod II should have corrosion-resistant stainless steel, but only three of these were built. The first of 27/33 Nimrod IIs was delivered in March 1933. Operational history The first production Nimrod Is entered service in 1932 with No.408 Flight on . Others went to No.s 402 and 409 Flights soon after. Fleet Air Arm flights were reorganised into Squadrons early in 1933, with the Nimrods joining No.s 801, 802 and 803 Squadrons RAF. The Nimrod II followed in September 1934. Few Nimrods were exported, though one aircraft was supplied to Japan and one to Portugal. Two went to Denmark, where they were known as the Nimrodderne. They were intended as pattern aircraft for proposed licence building and were essentially Nimrod Is, though powered by Kestrel IIIS engines. One, unusually, was fitted with spats. The Nimrod had been replaced by more modern designs such as the Sea Gladiator by May 1939, before the start of World War II.

Gossops Green is located in the west of the town and is bordered by Bewbush to the south west, Ifield to the north and Southgate to the east across the ring road. Gossops Green is also a local government ward. History Before 1946 There is mention of Gossipsgreen on a map dated 1795. Maps in the first half of the 1800s show Gossipsgreen in varying layouts surrounded by farmland and close to a few small estates. Gossipsgreen amounted to a hamlet along the north side of what is now known as Gossops Green Lane. The main road ran east‚Äìwest through the settlement. At the west end the road turned north towards the village of Ifield passing The Craigans, a house with gardens which was demolished and developed as private housing in the 1970s. To the east the road ran to Crawley through what is now Goffs Park and West Green. A road led south from Gossipsgreen approximately along what is now Dower Walk, past Dower House and Woldhurstlee estate and on towards Buxwood (later Buckswood) Farm. Woldhurstlee was demolished during the New Town development. The site of the house is now in public woodland off Buckswood Drive. The railway was built in the 1830s to the north of Gossipsgreen and ran by Hazelwood, a wooded area behind the hamlet, then past The Craigans before dividing Ifield Mill Pond to the west. Ifield railway station was first a halt on the road leading from Gossipsgreen to Ifield. During Victorian times, Gossipsgreen disappeared from published maps, though The Craigans, Dower House and Woldhurstlee continued to be marked. By 1946, a year before the formation of the Crawley Development Corporation, the hamlet reappeared on the map but the name had changed to Gossops Green. 1946 and After Crawley Development Corporation was formed in 1947 as a result of the New Towns Act 1946. At this time, Crawley had a population of 6,000 people. It was a declared objective that the New Town would be home to 50,000 people by 1961. It had achieved this by 1958 before Gossops Green was built. According to A History of the County of Sussex (1987, Hudson et al., online), the new neighbourhood of Gossops Green was ninth and last of the original New Town communities laid out during 1956-7 and built between 1958 and 1961. Later developments include The Holy Trinity School (1967), Hillmead and Parkhurst Close (formerly The Craigans) and private housing between The Holy Trinity School and Buckswood Drive (1970-80s). The old road into Ifield was reconstructed as an extension to Ifield Drive leading into another new neighbourhood of Ifield over a manually operated railway crossing similar to that still found down the line at Littlehaven railway station. The road name was changed to Craigans (after the adjacent, demolished house of the same name) after the construction of a road bridge over the railway at Overdene Drive, following which the railway crossing was closed. Education Primary Gossops Green Community Primary School has approximately 500 pupils from 4 to 11 years old. It is a feeder school for Ifield Community CollegeThe Holy Trinity CoE School as well as others. Secondary The Holy Trinity School is a voluntary aided church school of approximately 1200 pupils between 11 and 19 years old. It takes pupils from a wide area including Horsham and Crawley Down. Transport Gossops Green's main road; Gossops Drive Gossops Green is on the A23 trunk road which was the main London to Brighton route before the M23 motorway was opened in the 1970s, which by- passed Crawley. The main estate road is Gossops Drive which leads off the A23 and links up with Mowbray Drive in Bewbush. Ifield railway station serves western Crawley and is on the Arun Valley Line from Three Bridges to Horsham and Bognor Regis and the station is on the northern edge of the neighbourhood. Trains run regularly to and from London (45-minute journey) and Gatwick Airport (10-minute journey). When the station first opened in 1907, it was briefly known as Lyons Crossing Halt (then Ifield Halt), possibly because Lions Farm and fish pond used to stand here alongside the railway on the site now occupied by Hillmead. Regular buses run to and from Crawley town centre along Gossops Drive. Religion Church of England St. Alban's Church. Catholic St. Theodore of Canterbury Roman Catholic Church. Spiritualist Crawley Spiritualist Church, Capel Lane. Economy Being a neighbourhood, there is no industry in Gossops Green. Many residents work in the town, on the industrial estate at Manor Royal and at Gatwick Airport, which is in Crawley. There is a significant number of people who take the train to work in places like London, Croydon and Horsham. In Gossops Green, employment is limited and is mainly in the retail sector at the shopping parade though some local people may be employed at the schools and small service-sector employers.

They toured frequently in Sweden and made a German tour in 1991 with fellow Swedish EBM¬¥ers Poupp√©e Fabrikk. The lineup were originally a foursome, but somewhere along the line they lost a member and in 2002 there was Andreas Carlsson, Johan Nygren and Carl Sj√∂str√∂m left. The band was named after Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. The band slipped into the unknown after their 1994 release \\"Heads off to freedom\\". There was talk about releasing new material after the release of the 2002 compilation CD, but Scapa Flow seems to have slipped into oblivion yet again.

illustration is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device such as a tablet or a mouse. It is distinguished from computer-generated art, which is produced by a computer using mathematical models created by the artist. It is also distinct from digital manipulation of photographs, in that it is an original construction \\"from scratch\\". (Photographic elements may be incorporated into such works, but they are not necessarily the primary basis Pointing devices Mice are not very precise for drawing, so a graphics tablet is an important tool for a digital illustrator, because it allows the user to make a mark easily in any direction, in a way that reflects the natural or \\"lively\\" line made by the human hand. In addition to flexibility of movement, an industry-standard digital drawing tablet has a pressure-sensitive surface, allowing the illustrator to make marks that vary from faint to bold, and from thin to broad. These variations mimic traditional wet and dry media. Drawing on a digital drawing tablet starts to feel natural after about a week of practice. A hybrid graphics tablet/screen might be helpful, since the artist can see more accurately where to place strokes in the image, but the hardware is currently much more expensive. Illustration software Example of an original bitmap (raster) painting in Photoshop. Note the fuzzy textures and transitions between colors that are typical of a painting program. Example of an original vector drawing in Illustrator. Note the precise edges of shapes and even width of lines that are typical of a drawing program. There are two main types of tools used for digital illustration: bitmapped (also known as \\"raster\\") and vector applications. Bitmap applications are commonly called \\"painting\\" programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, while vector applications, such as Adobe Illustrator, are called \\"drawing\\" programs. These terms reflect the difference in look-and-feel between the images created in each type of program. With a bitmap application, the content is stored digitally in fixed rows and columns of pixels, which can be created in separate layers for more easily isolating and manipulating different parts of the image. A bitmap image contains information about each pixel's hue (color), luminance (brightness), and saturation (intensity of color). When the pointing device moves over an area of the image, new colors and values are applied to the underlying pixels. Painting tools allow the easy creation of \\"fuzzy\\" imagery, including effects such as glows and soft shadows, and textures such as fur, velvet, stone and skin, and are heavily used in photo-retouching. With vector-based tools, the content is stored digitally as resolution-independent mathematical formulae describing lines (open paths), shapes (closed paths), and color fills, strokes or gradients. Vector paths are constructed of anchor points and path segments by using the pointing device to click and drag. Many vector graphics are readily available for download from online databases which can then be edited and incorporated into larger projects. Drawing tools typically create precise lines, shapes and patterns with well-defined edges and are superb for working with complex constructions such as maps and typography. Digital illustrations may include both raster and vector graphics in the same work. A bitmap image file may be saved in a format which embeds a layer of vector information, and vector image file may include imported bitmap images.  Digital techniques  Photobashing is a commonly used techniques by concept artists. The process involves the artist merging and blending photographs and/or 3d assets while painting to composite a final art piece. This technique is very similar to the process of compositing in video editing. This technique is commonly used by concept artist to help increase the speed of their workflow to achieve a more realistic look.

Sometimes he is styled Hakon the Powerful (). Background Haakon was the son of Sigurd Haakonsson, Jarl of Lade and ruler of Tr√∏ndelag and H√•logaland. His mother was Bergljot Toresdatter, daughter of Tore Ragnvaldsson, Jarl of M√∏re. Adam of Bremen wrote that he was \\"of the stock of Ivar (possibly Ivar the Boneless) and descended from a race of giants\\".Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum II xxv (¬ß 22), tr. Francis J. Tschan, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen. New York, 1959. In the sagas, Haakon claimed descent from the divine lineage of S√¶ming, son of Odin. The Hakon Jarl Runestones in Sweden may refer to him. Reign Battle between Haakon Jarl and brothers of Harald Greycloak Christian Krogh (1899) Haakon Jarl commands the clergymen to return ashore Christian Krogh (1899) Haakon became earl after his father was killed by King Harald Greycloak's men in 961. Haakon Jarl warred with King Harald for some time, until he was forced to flee to Denmark, where he conspired with Harald Bluetooth against Harald Greycloak. The two arranged the death of Harald Greycloak around 971, after which Harald Bluetooth invited his foster-son to be invested with new Danish fiefs. Civil war broke out between Haakon Jarl and the surviving brothers of Harald Greycloak, but Haakon proved victorious. Sturluson, Snorri ; Eir√≠kr Magn√∫son (trans.) ; √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar, chapters 12 to 14, in Heimskringla. History of the Kings of Norway, 1905 After this, Haakon Jarl ruled Norway as a vassal of Harald Bluetooth, but he was in reality an independent ruler. For Harald, he attacked G√∂taland and killed its ruler Ottar Jarl. Around 973‚Äì974, he went to Denmark to help Harald Bluetooth of Denmark in his defense against the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. Otto's forces successfully opposed an attempt by Harald to throw off the German yoke. After that Haakon paid no taxes to Denmark. Haakon was a strong believer in the old Norse gods, even after Harald Bluetooth forced him to accept baptism around 975 and assigned him clergymen to take to Norway to spread Christianity. When a favourable wind came for Haakon to leave, he commanded the clergymen to return ashore,Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade (The Unification of Norway ca. 820 to ca. 1020 AD) and broke his allegiance to Denmark. In 977 Vladimir I of Kiev fled to him, collecting as many of the Viking warriors as he could to assist him to recover Novgorod, and on his return the next year marched against Yaropolk I of Kiev. In 986, a Danish invasion fleet led by the fabled Jomsvikings was defeated at the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr. In 995, a quarrel broke out between Haakon and the Tr√∏nders just as Olaf Tryggvason, a descendant of Harald Fairhair arrived. Haakon quickly lost all support, and was killed by his own slave and friend, Tormod Kark, while hiding in the pig sty in the farm Rimul in Melhus. Jarlshola is the location in Melhus thought to have been the hiding place of Haakon Jarl and Tormod Kark on their last night before the infamous murder at Rimul. After his death, Haakon Jarl's two sons Eirik H√•konson and Sveinn H√°konarson, fled for protection to the king of Sweden, Olof Sk√∂tkonung. A number of (textually related) sources also recount Earl Haakon's predilection for raping women, whether the daughters of nobles or of commoners.See John McKinnell, ‚ÄòOn Hei√∞r‚Äô, Saga-Book of the Viking Society, 25 (2001), 394-417, www.vsnrweb- publications.org.uk/Saga-Book XXV.pdf#page=420.

The play is based on the story of Haakon Jarl and Tormod Kark as portrayed in the Sagas by Snorri Sturluson. The first play was a poetic tableau that was made in connection with the 800-year anniversary of the Lade Church (Lade kirke) in 1989 and repeated two years later. In 1995, Idar Lind wrote a new script. The music is composed by Frode Fjellheim. Primary sources Source basis for Haakon Jarl are considerable. He was given coverage in several sagas, including by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas√∂gum and more. According to Hallfre√∞ar saga the poet Hallfre√∞r composed a dr√°pa on the earl. Several disjoint stanzas by Hallfre√∞r in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l are often thought to belong to this otherwise lost poem. Oehlenschl√§ger tragedy Haakon Jarl's life also received literary treatment by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschl√§ger, in his tragedy Hakon Jarl, written in six weeks in 1805 during a stay in Halle, after reading Snorri's Heimskringla. The theme is the conflict between paganism and Christianity. There is an English translation by J. C. Lindberg. Oehlenschl√§ger's play later formed the basis for Smetana's symphonic poem Hakon Jarl.DeLong, Kenneth (1998). \\"Hearing His Master's Voice: Smetana's 'Swedish' Symphonic Poems and their Lisztian Models\\" in Michael Saffle (ed.), Liszt and His World, pp. 295‚Äì334.

Portrait by Maksymilian Fajans. Karol Lipi≈Ñski by Walenty Wa≈Ñkowicz, 1822. Karol J√≥zef Lipi≈Ñski (30 October 1790 - 16 December 1861) was a Polish music composer and virtuoso violinist active during the partitions of Poland. The Karol Lipi≈Ñski University of Music in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland is named after him. Life Lipi≈Ñski was born in Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski. His father was Feliks Lipi≈Ñski (1765‚Äì1847), and he had a younger brother of the same name Feliks (1815‚Äì1865). In 1810 he became the first violin and two years later the conductor of the opera orchestra at Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine). In 1817 he went to Italy in the hope of hearing Niccol√≤ Paganini. The two met in Milan, met daily to play, and even performed two concerts together in April 1818, which added immensely to Lipi≈Ñski's reputation. Paganini dedicated his Burlesque Variations on \\"La Carnaval de Venise\\", Op. 10 for unaccompanied violin to Lipi≈Ñski. Later, in 1827, Lipi≈Ñski returned the honour by dedicating his \\"Three Caprices for Violin\\" to Paganini. In 1818 on his return to Germany he stopped in Trieste to receive instruction from Dr Mazzurana, a very elderly former pupil of Giuseppe Tartini; Mazzurana was ninety years old, and could no longer play himself, but gave his criticism of Lipi≈Ñski's performance of one of Tartini's sonatas. During that time, he also performed concerts together with the Polish pianist and composer Maria Agata Szymanowska. In 1820 he travelled to Berlin where he met Louis Spohr, and to Russia. In 1829 he went to Warsaw, and played a series of concerts with Paganini that summer that were attended by the nineteen-year-old Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. However, a rivalry developed between Lipi≈Ñski and Paganini which destroyed their friendship. Thereafter, whenever Paganini was asked who the greatest violinist was, he would say \\"I don't know who the greatest is, but Lipi≈Ñski is certainly the second greatest\\". In 1835‚Äì36 he went on a long tour, during which he met Robert Schumann in Leipzig. Schumann was so impressed that he dedicated Carnaval, Op. 9 to him. In 1836 he visited England and played his Military Concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In June 1839 he received a double appointment in Dresden, as concertmaster of the Royal Oratory and kapellmeister at the court chapel.A letter to his wife of 2 July 1839 (√ñsterreichischen Nationalbibliothek) . With his Dresden duties, he ceased touring as a virtuoso, but concentrated on chamber music, with a special devotion to the string quartets of Beethoven. Here he also gave a joint recital with Liszt, performing Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. He developed a great reputation as the only serious rival to Paganini. Henryk Wieniawski dedicated his Polonaise de concert, Op.4 to Lipi≈Ñski, like Ignacy Feliks Dobrzy≈Ñski his String Quartet No. 2, Op.40. He retired with a pension in 1861, and died in village Virliv (Ternopil region, Ukraine). He was the owner of two violins, one made in 1715 by Antonio Stradivari and another by Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges√π. Both instruments are referred to as \\"ex-Lipinski\\". The Karol Lipi≈Ñski Academy of Music in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland was named after him.  Compositions  Early in his life, during his assignment at Lviv theatre, Lipi≈Ñski composed 3 symphonies (Op. 2) and 3 operas: K≈Ç√≥tnia przez zak≈Çad, Terefere w Tarapacie, and Syrena Dniestru. The last one is an adaptation, with some of his own original music interpolated, of Ferdinand Kauer's Donauweibchen and was played every season at Lviv for nearly thirty years from 1814, but the music is now lost. Naturally, most of Lipi≈Ñski's compositions are for violin. These include four violin concertos (a fifth is lost), two string trios (originally for an ensemble 2 violins and a cello) as well as polonaises, rondos, variations, capriccios. He also composed several songs and harmonized some popular Polish tunes.  Recordings  His compositions have been recorded among others by Polish virtuoso violinist Konstanty Andrzej Kulka of the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw.Konstanty Andrzej Kulka , Firma fonograficzna Universal Music Group, January 2013. Of the major works, all the concertos, both trios, a symphony and an overture have been recorded, some of them more than one time. Notes  Further reading  * Henryka Filatowna. K.J.

The paper was originally led by secular writers but over the years it became more religious. Makor Rishon is associated with Religious Zionism and with the conservative right-wing of Israel.  History  Makor Rishon was founded as a weekly magazine in July 1997 in order to create an independent newspaper with a Jewish religious and nationalistic slant. The paper was the brainchild of its original owner, Rabbi Shmuel Tal. The Listenberg family, a National Religious family in the diamond business based in Belgium and Tel Aviv financed the founding of the newspaper. Journalist Meir Uziel was hired to recruit the staff. Uziel enlisted Michael Ruzulio to find writers. Ruzulio had served as a reporter for Yedioth Ahronoth as well as for the Second Authority for Television and Radio, and helped create the ‚ÄúVoice of the Red Sea‚Äù radio station. The newsroom was established in the ‚ÄúPirsum Yisrael‚Äù offices located in Givat Shaul in Jerusalem and included religious and secular journalists and editors. The majority of the newspaper's editors in its early years were secular and included Meir Uziel, Michael Ruzulio, Yehuda Levi (journalist) and Ofer Shapira. Earnings from the paper were low and its financial situation worsened. The paper closed down at the end of October 1999, after which the owners filed for bankruptcy. Makor Rishon was reestablished after five weeks, in December 1999, under the auspices of a company named ‚ÄúThe New Makor Rishon‚Äù ‚Äì a move that enabled its purchaser, Dr. Michael Karash, to derive benefit from the newspaper's name without having to be burdened by past debts. Karash worked to broaden the subscriber base and to make the paper financially viable. Over the course of 2003, the paper was purchased by businessman Shlomo Ben-Tzvi. After the buyout, changes were made that included a significant increase in the number of pages and journalists as well as a move to a broadsheet newspaper format. Until mid-2007, Makor Rishon was published as a weekly. On April 25, 2007, the HaTzofe daily was incorporated into Makor Rishon, which started appearing with the logo ‚ÄúMakor Rishon-HaTzofe‚Äù. Shlomo Ben-Tzvi, who until then had been the newspaper's CEO, was appointed the editor-in-chief. Makor Rishon was then published as a daily for the next two years. In November 2008, the newspaper entered into financial difficulties. The employees requested the court liquidate the assets of the paper. The newspaper dealt with the crises by drastically cutting content, raising prices, firing workers, and closing down its website and article archives, among other actions. Starting from June 2009, the paper returned to being a weekly. A reduced daily edition was distributed only to subscribers but was made available on the newspaper's website, and a weekend edition was also attainable at newsstands. On February 16, 2012, the newspaper began distributing a free expanded edition at various locations throughout the country, that contained many references to the newspaper's flagship edition that is sold on weekends, a move intended to increase sales and subscribers for the Friday edition. On March 9, 2014, Ben- Tzvi's request for a two-month injunction to halt bankruptcy proceedings against the Makor Rishon and Ma‚Äôariv newspapers was approved by the court. On March 30, 2014, the Jerusalem District Court approved selling the newspaper to Israel Hayom for 14 million shekels,. and Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo approved the sale one month later. On September 23, 2014, the daily edition was printed for the last time. Starting from this date, only the weekend edition is published.  Newspaper format  In the past, the newspaper had only included a main news section, a news journal and a weekly magazine, Diyukan, that also included a cultural supplement. After Shlomo Ben-Tzvi purchased the newspaper in 2003, new supplements began appearing, which culminated with the switch to a new format in May 2005. The newspaper has undergone frequent changes since Ben-Tzvi purchased it. In its current format, the paper includes eight sections: * General News ‚Äì news items; editorial articles; opinion columns; and finance, science, sports and local travel sections. *Yoman (Journal) ‚Äì a weekly current affairs supplement containing articles, interviews and personal columns. The regular sections are Amnon Lord's column ‚ÄúNeged Haruach‚Äù; a current events poetry column by Tzur Ehrlich; Adi Arbel's series of observations ‚ÄúLo Actuali‚Äù; political journalist Sophia Ron-Moriah's column; Pazit Rabinah's section ‚ÄúTeivat Pandora‚Äù containing international affairs expos√©s; a satirical section ‚ÄúBrichat Hamochot‚Äù edited by Gidon Dukov; and a weekly in-depth article on Middle Eastern affairs by Dr. Mordechai Kider. Avinadav Vitkun and Ariel Kahana are among the regular contributors. The supplement's editor was Ori Elitzur. After his death in 2014, Chaggai Segal took over as editor, and his current news column which had been in Diyukan, was moved to the ‚ÄúYoman‚Äù. * Diyukan (Portrait) ‚Äì a magazine that includes personal interest stories, personal columns and various sections, including an automotive section by Edward Atler, a food column by Ori Melamed, a travelogue by Galit Dehan-Karlibach, a computer games section by Assi Tubia, a broadcast calendar, a crosswords section and a film review by Nachum Mochiach (which had been written in the past by Renanit Parshani, preceded by Yuval Rivlin). Orly Goldklang is the supplement's editor-in-chief. In the past, Goldklang had written, together with Maya Levenson, ‚ÄúTzippornaim‚Äù, a humor column, and today writes ‚ÄúPuzzle‚Äù on the first page. The magazine's regular writers include Yifat Ehrlich, David Chermetz, Rikki Rat, Tzur Ehrlich, and Elyashiv Reichner. * Shabbat (Sabbath) ‚Äì a supplement for Jewish philosophy, Judaism and literature, with an intellectual bent. The editor-in-chief is Elchanan Nir. The editor of the section for book review is Dr. Shmuel Faust. * Motzash (Motza'ei Shabbat) ‚Äì a life-style magazine that began appearing in 2011. The editor-in-chief is Elad Teneh. The editor is Ariel Shinbal.  Past supplements  * Tzedek (Justice) ‚Äì news and commentaries in the fields of religious and secular law, edited by Yehuda Yifrach. From January 1, 2005, until February 2006, the weekly ‚ÄúHashavuon‚Äù, a culture supplement that also contained a calendar for scheduled broadcasts and plays. Tamar Nesher-Rati was the editor-in-chief. The assistant editor was Shai Tzeler. * Nashim (Women) ‚Äì a supplement geared to women that began appearing in the summer of 2006 and is published bi-weekly. Limor Garzim-Magen is the editor. Before this supplement began there was a magazine, termed Pnei Isha, that was edited by Ronny Shuv, preceded by Ayelet Kedem. * Otiot (Letters) ‚Äì a magazine for children and teens. A joint venture started in 2011 by the merger of the Makor L‚ÄôYiladim supplement and the established Otiot magazine. The new magazine was initially called ‚ÄúOtiot L‚ÄôYiladim‚Äù, after which it returned to being called ‚ÄúOtiot, a newspaper from Makor Rishon‚Äù. The first edition of Makor L‚ÄôYiladim appeared on December 10, 2004. Its editors were Etti Elboim and Orit Zimmer. In previous years, a two-page children‚Äôs section had appeared in the Diyukan supplement. In its final years, its editor was Ehud Maksimov. Among its writers were Shoshie Greenfield, Yoel Chait, Yossi Shachar and Avinadav Vitkon. * Sukariot (Candies) ‚Äì a newspaper for preschoolers, known as the sister paper to Otiot. Before the merger between the children's supplements of Makor Rishon and the newspapers from Otiot, Makor Rishon had published a supplement for preschoolers entitled ‚ÄúAnakim‚Äù. The two supplements were unified but the name Sukariot remained. At the start of the newspaper‚Äôs switch to the new format, a vacation supplement was added, which became bi-weekly and was quickly cancelled. In June of 2006, several months after the cancellation of ‚ÄúHashavuon‚Äù, a bi-weekly section entitled ‚ÄúShishi Yisraeli‚Äù was added, that was planned to become a weekly. It was a glossy supplement in a small format and contained articles on topics of current affairs. It was cancelled after around three months. The Kalkala supplement edited by economist Eran Bar-Tal and the sports section edited by Dotan Malach were originally separate entities, but since August 3, 2012 have been incorporated into the Motzash magazine. For a while, the newspaper published Shabbat Hagadol ‚Äì an expanded Jewish philosophy supplement that appeared three times a year and was edited by Yoav Shurek. The paper also published Makori ‚Äì a Shabbat pamphlet that was distributed free of charge in synagogues and contained condensed articles from the Makor Rishon newspaper and from other sections, but was canceled towards the end of 2010.  The Shabbat supplement  The newspaper‚Äôs Shabbat supplement deals with the topics of Jewish philosophy, literature and Torah thought and has been in print since 2004. Yoav Shurek was the editor from its inception until 2012. The current editor is Rabbi Elchanan Nir, with Dr. Shmuel Faust for book reviews. The Shabbat supplement combines Jewish content with articles on literature and the arts, in a format similar to Haaretz‚Äôs ‚ÄúCulture and Literature‚Äù supplement. Shabbat deals with more extensive subject matter and is far longer than a regular literary supplement. It has 24 pages which has been the case for nearly all the years it has been in existence. The supplement is highly regarded and is considered a respectable platform where authors, poets, translators, researchers and Torah scholars can publish regularly. It also serves as a forum to publish short stories and poetry. The supplement‚Äôs format has only undergone minor changes since its inception. The front page features a work of art (a drawing or a photograph) together with a quotation. The supplement is published in a similar format as Maariv‚Äôs culture supplement, entitled ‚ÄúErev Shabbat‚Äù, which contains exclusive material including weekly columns by Dov Elboim and Yair Sheleg. The sections in the supplement are: a regular column on the weekly Torah portion whose author changes from Chumash to Chumash; ‚ÄúArachim from a Jewish Lexicon‚Äù by Professor Shalom Rosenberg; a poetry review by Yonatan Berg, a music review by Amichai Chason; Chayuta Deutsch's column ‚ÄúLipnai U‚Äôlifnim‚Äù; ‚ÄúB‚Äôsafa Acheret‚Äù ‚Äì a monthly overview of periodicals from around the world by Zeev Shpeidel; ‚ÄúYashan Mipnei Chadash‚Äù, a book column by Edmiel Cosman; and a section dealing with rabbinic leaders in Jewish communities around the world written by Rabbi Eliyahu Birenbaum.  Exclusives  The newspaper claims several exclusives to its credit, such as exposing the non-profit organizations affair in which Ehud Barak was involved during the 1999 general Israeli elections, and election fraud accusations made during the Labor party primaries that year that led to MK Ediso Masalah‚Äôs defeat.

It led to significant changes in civil life and state matters in Z√ºrich and spread to several other cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Seven cantons remained Roman Catholic, though, which led to inter-cantonal wars known as the Wars of Kappel. After the victory of the Catholic cantons in 1531, they proceeded to institute counter-reformatory policies in some regions. The schism and distrust between Catholic and Protestant cantons would define their interior politics and paralyse any common foreign policy until well into the 18th century. Despite their religious differences, and despite an exclusively Catholic defence alliance of the seven Catholic cantons (Goldener Bund), further major armed conflicts directly between the cantons did not occur. Soldiers from both sides fought in the French Wars of Religion. In the Thirty Years' War, the thirteen cantons managed to maintain their neutrality, partly because all major powers in Europe depended on Swiss mercenaries, and would not let Switzerland fall into the hands of one of their rivals. The Three Leagues (Drei B√ºnde) of the Grisons, at that time not yet a member of the confederacy, were involved in the war from 1620 on, which led to their loss of the Valtellina from 1623 to 1639. Development of Protestantism After the violent conflicts of the late 15th century the Swiss cantons had had a generation of relative political stability.Norman Birnbaum. The Zwinglian Reformation in Zurich // Past and Present, ‚Ññ15 (Apr., 1959), p. 28. As part of their struggle for independence, they had already in the 15th century sought to limit the influence of the Church on their political sovereignty. Many monasteries had already come under secular supervision, and the administration of schools was in the hands of the cantons, although the teachers generally still were priests. Nevertheless, many of the problems of the Church also existed in the Swiss Confederacy. Many a cleric as well as the Church as a whole enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle in stark contrast to the conditions the large majority of the population lived in; this luxury was financed by high church taxes and abundant sale of indulgences. Many priests were badly educated, and spiritual Church doctrines were often disregarded. Many priests did not live in celibacy but in concubinage. The new reformatory ideas thus fell on fertile ground. Huldrych Zwingli (woodcut by Hans Asper, 1531). The main proponent of the Reformation in Switzerland was Huldrych Zwingli, whose actions during the Affair of the Sausages are now considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland. His own studies, in the renaissance humanist tradition, had led him to preach against injustices and hierarchies in the Church already in 1516 while he was still a priest in Einsiedeln. When he was called to Z√ºrich, he expanded his criticism also onto political topics and in particular condemned the mercenary business. His ideas were received favourably, especially by entrepreneurs, businessmen, and the guilds. The first disputation of Z√ºrich of 1523 was the breakthrough: the city council decided to implement his reformatory plans and to convert to Protestantism. Iconoclasm in Zurich, 1524. In the following two years, profound changes took place in Z√ºrich. The Church was thoroughly secularised. Priests were relieved from celibacy and the opulent decorations in the churches were thrown out. The state assumed the administration of Church properties, financing the social works (which up to then were managed entirely by the Church), and also paid the priests. The last abbess of the Fraum√ºnster, Katharina von Zimmern, turned over the convent including all of its rights and possessions to the city authorities on 30 November 1524. She even married the next year. John Calvin Over the next few years, the cities of St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Basel, Bienne, Mulhouse, and finally Bern (in 1528) all followed the example set by Z√ºrich. Their subject territories were converted to Protestantism by decree. In Basel, reformer Johannes Oecolampadius was active, in St. Gallen, the Reformation was adopted by mayor Joachim Vadian. In Glarus, Appenzell, and in the Grisons, which all three had a more republican structure, individual communes decided for or against the Reformation. In the French-speaking parts, reformers like William Farel had been preaching the new faith under Bernese protection since the 1520s, but only in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there, did the city of Geneva convert to Protestantism. The same year, Bern conquered the hitherto Savoyard Vaud and also instituted Protestantism there. Despite their conversion to Protestantism, the citizens of Geneva were not ready to adopt Calvin's new strict Church order, and banned him and Farel from the city in 1538. Three years later, following the election of a new city council, Calvin was called back. Step by step he implemented his strict programme. A counter-revolt in 1555 failed, and many established families left the city. In search of a common theology Zwingli, who had studied in Basel at the same time as Erasmus, had arrived at a more radical renewal than Luther and his ideas differed from the latter in several points. A reconciliation attempt at the Marburg Colloquy in 1529 failed. Although the two charismatic leaders found a consensus on fourteen points, they kept differing on the last one on the Eucharist: Luther maintained that through sacramental union the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper became truly the flesh and blood of Christ, whereas Zwingli considered bread and wine only symbols. This schism and the defeat of Z√ºrich in the Second War of Kappel in 1531, where Zwingli was killed on the battlefield, were a serious setback, ultimately limiting Zwinglianism to parts of the Swiss confederacy and preventing its adoption in areas north of the Rhine. Heinrich Bullinger After Zwingli's death, Heinrich Bullinger took over his post in Z√ºrich. Reformers in Switzerland continued for the next decades to reform the Church and to improve its acceptance by the common people. Bullinger in particular also tried bridging the differences between Zwinglianism and Calvinism. He was instrumental in establishing the Consensus Tigurinus of 1549 with John Calvin and the Confessio Helvetica posterior of 1566, which finally included all Protestant cantons and associates of the confederacy. The Confessio was also accepted in other European Protestant regions in Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands, and Scotland, and together with the Heidelberg Catechism of 1563, where Bullinger also played an important role, and the Canons of Dordrecht of 1619 it would become the theological foundation of Protestantism of the Calvinist strain. Religious civil war Map of the Old Swiss Confederacy 1536 showing the religious division The success of the Reformation in Z√ºrich and its rapid territorial expansion definitely made this religious renewal a political issue and a major source of conflict between the thirteen cantons. The alpine cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, and Zug remained staunchly Catholic. Their opposition was not uniquely a question of faith; economic reasons also played a role. Besides on agriculture, their economy depended to a large degree on the mercenary services and the financial recompensations for the same. They could not afford to lose this source of income, which was a major target of reformatory criticism. In contrast, the cities' economies were more diversified, including strong crafts and guilds as well as a budding industrial sector. Fribourg and Solothurn also remained Catholic. The five alpine cantons perceived the Reformation as a threat early on; already in 1524 they formed the \\"League of the Five Cantons\\" (Bund der f√ºnf Orte) to combat the spreading of the new faith. Both sides tried to strengthen their positions by concluding defensive alliances with third parties: the Protestant cantons formed a city alliance, including the Protestant cities of Konstanz and Strasbourg (Christliches Burgrecht), translated variously as Cristian Civic Union, Christian Co-burghery, Christian Confederation and Christian Federation (in Latin Zwingli called it Civitas Christiana or Christian State); the Catholic ones entered a pact with Ferdinand of Austria. In the tense atmosphere, small incidents could easily escalate. Conflicts arose especially over the situation in the common territories, where the administration changed bi-annually among cantons and thus switched between Catholic and Protestant rules. Several mediation attempts failed such as the disputation of Baden in 1526. After numerous minor incidents and provocations from both sides, a Protestant pastor was burned on the stake in Schwyz in 1529, and in retaliation Z√ºrich declared war. By mediation of the other cantons, open war (known as the First War of Kappel) was barely avoided, but the peace agreement (Erster Landfriede) was not exactly favourable for the Catholic party, who had to dissolve its alliance with the Austrian Habsburgs. The tensions remained essentially unresolved. The forces of Z√ºrich are defeated in the battle of Kappel. Two years later, the second war of Kappel broke out. Z√ºrich was taking the refusal of the Catholic cantons to help the Grisons in the Musso war as a pretext, but on 11 October 1531, the Catholic cantons decisively defeated the forces of Z√ºrich in the battle of Kappel am Albis. Zwingli was killed on the battlefield. The Protestant cantons had to agree to a peace treaty, the so- called Zweiter Kappeler Landfriede, which forced the dissolution of the Protestant alliance (Christliches Burgrecht). It gave Catholicism the priority in the common territories, but allowed communes that had already converted to remain Protestant. Only strategically important places such as the Freiamt or those along the route from Schwyz to the Rhine valley at Sargans (and thus to the Alpine passes in the Grisons) were forcibly re-Catholicised. In their own territories, the cantons remained free to implement one or the other religion. The peace thus prescribed the Cuius regio, eius religio-principle that would also be adopted in the peace of Augsburg in the Holy Roman Empire in 1555. Politically, this gave the Catholic cantons a majority in the Tagsatzung, the federal diet of the confederacy. When their Protestant city alliance was dissolved, Z√ºrich and the southern German cities joined the Schmalkaldic League, but in the German religious wars of 1546/47, Z√ºrich and the other Swiss Protestant cantons remained strictly neutral. With the victory of Charles V the previously close relations to the Swabian Protestant cities in the Holy Roman Empire were severed: many cities, like Konstanz, were re- Catholicised and many were placed under a strictly aristocratic rule. Counter-Reformation Religious division of the Old Confederacy during the 17th and 18th century While the official Church remained passive during the beginnings of the Reformation, the Swiss Catholic cantons took measures early on to keep the new movement at bay. They assumed judicial and financial powers over the clergy, laid down firm rules of conduct for the priests, outlawed concubinage, and reserved the right to nominate priests in the first place, who previously had been assigned by the bishoprics. They also banned printing, distributing, and possessing Reformist tracts; and banned the study of Hebrew and Greek (to put an end to the independent study of biblical sources). Overall, these measures were successful: not only did they prevent the spreading of the Reformation into the Catholic cantons but also they made the Church dependent on the state and generally strengthened the power of the civil authorities. Carlo Borromeo The Catholic cantons also maintained their domination of the Catholic Church after the Council of Trent (1545 to 1563), although they had accepted its positions. They opposed Cardinal Borromeo's plans for the creation of a new bishopric in central Switzerland. However, they did participate in the education program of Trent. In 1574, the first Jesuit school was founded in Lucerne. Others soon followed, and in 1579, a Catholic university for Swiss priests, the Collegio helvetico, was founded in Milan. In 1586, a nunciature was opened in Lucerne. The Capuchins were also called to help; a Capuchin cloister was founded in 1581 in Altdorf. Parallel to these efforts to reform the Catholic Church, the Catholic cantons also proceeded to re-Catholicize regions that had converted to Protestantism. Besides reconversions in the common territories, the Catholic cantons in 1560 first tried to undo the Reformation in Glarus, where the Catholics were a minority. The five Catholic cantons formed a military alliance with the Pope and the Catholic Duchy of Savoy, and had the support of Aegidius Tschudi, the Landammann (chief magistrate) of Glarus. But due to lack of money, they could not intervene in Glarus by force. In 1564, they settled for a treaty which prescribed the separation of religions in Glarus. There were henceforth two legislative assemblies (Landsgemeinde) in the canton, a Catholic and a Protestant one, and Glarus would send one Catholic and one Protestant representative each to the Tagsatzung. The Bishop of Basel, Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee, moved his seat to Porrentruy in the Jura mountains in 1529, when Basel became Protestant. In 1581, the bishopric regained the Birs valley lying southwest of Basel. In Appenzell, where both confessions coexisted more or less peacefully, the counter-reformatory activities beginning with the arrival of the Capuchin friars resulted in a split of the canton in 1597 into the Catholic Appenzell Innerrhoden and the Protestant Ausserrhoden, which both had one vote in the Tagsatzung. Developments in the west The Dukes of Savoy had tried already for centuries to gain sovereignty over the city of Geneva, surrounded by Savoyard territory, for the Vaud in the north of Lake Geneva belonged to the duchy. The Reformation prompted the conflicts to escalate once more. Geneva exiled its bishop, who was backed by Savoy, in 1533 to Annecy. Bern and the Valais took advantage of the duke's involvement in northern Italy and his opposition to France. When Francesco II Sforza died in Milan in 1534, the duke's troops were bound by the French engagement there, and Bern promptly conquered the Vaud and, together with the Valais, also territories south of Lake Geneva in 1536. The alliance of 1560 of the Catholic cantons with Savoy encouraged duke Emmanuel Philibert to raise claims on the territories his father Charles III had lost in 1536. After the treaty of Lausanne of 1564, Bern had to return the Chablais south of Lake Geneva and the Pays de Gex (between Geneva and Nyon) to Savoy in 1567, and the Valais returned the territories west of Saint Gingolph two years later in the treaty of Thonon. Geneva was thus a Protestant enclave within the Catholic territories of Savoy again and as a result intensified its relations with the Swiss confederacy and Bern and Z√ºrich in particular. Its plea for full acceptance into the confederation‚Äîthe city was an associate state only‚Äîwas rejected by the Catholic majority of cantons. Goldener Bund of 1586 Mercenaries of the Swiss cantons participated in the French wars of religion on all sides. Those from Protestant cantons fought on the sides of the Huguenots, supporting Henry of Navarre, while the Catholic troops fought for king Henry III of France. In 1586, the seven Catholic cantons (the five alpine cantons, plus Fribourg and Solothurn) formed an exclusively Catholic alliance called the \\"Golden League\\" (Goldener Bund, named after the golden initials on the document) and sided with the Guises, who were also supported by Spain. In 1589, Henry III was assassinated and Henry of Navarre succeeded him as Henry IV of France, and thus the Protestant mercenaries now fought for the king. Since 1586, the duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel I, had placed Geneva under an embargo. With the new situation of 1589, the city now got support not only from Bern but also from the French king, and it went to war. The war between Geneva and Savoy continued even after the Peace of Vervins and the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which ended the wars in France proper. In the night from 11 to 12 December 1602, the duke's troops unsuccessfully tried to storm the city, which definitely maintained its independence from Savoy in the peace of Saint Julien, concluded in the following summer. The rebuttal of this attack, L'Escalade, is still commemorated in Geneva today. Also in 1586, a Catholic coup d'√©tat in Mulhouse, an associate of the confederacy, prompted the military intervention of the Protestant cantons, which quickly restored the old Protestant order. Strasbourg, another Protestant city, wanted to join the confederacy in 1588, but like Geneva some twenty years earlier, it was rejected by the Catholic cantons. In the Valais, the Reformation had had some success especially in the lower part of the Rh√¥ne valley. However, in 1603 the Catholic cantons intervened, and with their support re-Catholicisation succeeded and the Protestant families had to emigrate. Thirty Years' War Siege of the Hohentwiel fort in 1641. During the Thirty Years' War, Switzerland was a relative \\"oasis of peace and prosperity\\" (Grimmelshausen) in war-torn Europe. The cantons had concluded numerous mercenary contracts and defence alliances with partners on all sides. Some of these contracts neutralized each other, which allowed the confederation to remain neutral. Politically, the neighbouring powers all tried to take influence, by way of mercenary commanders such as J√∂rg Jenatsch or Johann Rudolf Wettstein. Despite the cantons' religious differences, the Tagsatzung developed a strong consensus against any direct military involvement. The confederacy did not allow any foreign army to cross its territory: the alpine passes remained closed for Spain, just as an alliance offer of the Swedish King Gustav Adolph was rejected. The sole exception was the permission for the French army of Henri de Rohan to march through the Protestant cantons to the Grisons. A common defence was mounted only in 1647 when the Swedish armies reached Lake Constance again. The Grisons had no such luck. The Three Leagues were a loose federation of 48 individual communes that were largely independent; their common assembly held no real powers. While this had helped avoid major religious wars during and following the Reformation, feuds between leading clans (e.g. between the von Planta and the von Salis) were common. When such a feud spilled over into the Valtellina in 1619, a subject territory of the Three Leagues, the population there responded in kind, killing the Protestant rulers in 1620 and calling Habsburg Spain for help. For the next twenty years, the Grisons was ravaged by a war known as the Confusion of the Leagues. For the Habsburgs, the Grisons was a strategically important connection between Milan and Austria. The Valtellina became Spanish, and other parts in the north-east of the Grisons were occupied and re-Catholicised by Austria. France intervened a first time in 1624, but succeeded to drive the Spanish out of the Grisons only in 1636. However, Henri de Rohan's French army had to withdraw following the political intrigues of J√ºrg Jenatsch, who managed to play the French off against the Spaniards. Until 1639, the Three Leagues had re- acquired their whole territory, buying back the parts occupied by Austria. They even were restituted their subject territories in the south (Valtellina, Bormio, and Chiavenna), yet these had to remain Catholic under the protection of Milan. The mayor of Basel, Johann Rudolf Wettstein, lobbied for a formal recognition of the Swiss confederacy as an independent state in the peace of Westphalia. Although de facto independent since the end of the Swabian War in 1499, the confederacy was still officially a part of the Holy Roman Empire. With the support of Henri II d'Orl√©ans, who was also prince of Neuch√¢tel and the head of the French delegation, he succeeded to get the formal exemption from the empire for all cantons and associates of the confederacy. Social developments Hans Holbein's Totentanz, 1538. Historians count 13 (Geneva) or 14 (St Gallen) plague surges in Switzerland between 1500 and 1640, accounting for 31 plague years, and since 1580, smallpox outbreaks with an especially high mortality rate (80‚Äì90%) amongst children under the age of five occurred every four to five years. Nevertheless, the population in Switzerland grew in the 16th century from about 800,000 to roughly 1.1 million, i.e. by more than 35%. Absolutism on the rise This population growth caused significant changes in a pre-industrial society that could no longer significantly expand its territory. The dependence of the confederation on imports increased, and prices soared. In the countryside, settlements of estates increasingly lead to small and smallest properties insufficient to sustain a family, and a new class of daytalers (Tauner) grew disproportionally. In the cities, too, the number of poor rose. At the same time, rural subject territories became more and more (financially) dependent on the cities. The political power was concentrated in a few rich families, that over time came to consider their offices as hereditary and tried to limit them to their own exclusive circle. This solicited the response of both peasants and free citizens, who resented such curtailing of their democratic rights, and around 1523/25, also fuelled by the reformatory spirit, revolts broke out in many cantons, both rural and urban. The main objective of the insurgents was the restitution of common rights of old, not the institution of a new order. Although commonly called the Peasants' War, the movement also included the free citizens, who saw their rights restricted in the cities, too. Contrary to the development in the Holy Roman Empire, where the hostilities escalated and the rebellion was put down by force, there were only isolated armed conflicts in the confederation. The authorities, already involved in reformatory or counter-reformatory activities, managed to subdue these uprisings only by granting concessions. Yet the absolutist tendencies kept slowly transforming the democrat cantons into oligarchies. By 1650, the absolutist order was firmly established and would prevail for another 150 years as the Ancien R√©gime. Persecution of heretics The generally widespread intolerance of the time, as witnessed by the Inquisition, amplified by the conflicts between Protestants and Catholics, left no place for dissenters. Anabaptists, who took the idea of deriving new societal rules from the direct study of Biblical sources even further than the Protestant reformers only into conflict not only with the established Churches over the question of baptism but also with the civil authorities because, not having found any Biblical justification, they refused to pay taxes or to accept any authority. Both Catholic and Protestant cantons persecuted them with all their might. Following the forced drowning of Felix Manz in the Limmat in Z√ºrich in 1527, many Anabaptists emigrated to Moravia. Antitrinitarians fared no better; Miguel Servet was burned at the stake in Geneva on 27 October 1553. There was no individual freedom of religion in Switzerland‚Äîor indeed all of Europe‚Äîat that time anyway. The maxim of cuius regio, eius religio (\\"whose region, his religion\\") meant that subjects had to adopt the faith of their rulers. Dissenters who didn't want to convert typically had to (but also were allowed to) emigrate elsewhere, into a region where their faith was the state religion. The Bullinger family, for instance, had to move from Bremgarten in the Freiamt, which was re-Catholicised after the second war of Kappel, to the Protestant city of Z√ºrich. The 16th century also saw the height of witch-hunts in Europe, and Switzerland was no exception. Beginning about 1530, culminating around 1600, and then slowly diminishing, numerous witch trials were held in both Protestant and Catholic cantons. These often ended with death sentences (usually burning) for the accused, who typically were elderly women, crippled persons, or other social outcasts. Science and arts: the Renaissance in Switzerland The Old Swiss Confederacy on a map included in the \\"Topographia Helvetiae\\" by Matth√§us Merian 1652 Humanism and Renaissance led to new advances in science and the arts. Paracelsus taught at the University of Basel. Hans Holbein the Younger worked until 1526 in Basel; his high renaissance style had a profound influence on Swiss painters. Conrad Gessner in Z√ºrich did studies in systematic botany, and the geographic maps and city views produced e.g. by Matth√§us Merian show the beginning of a scientific cartography. In 1601, an early version of the theodolite was invented in Z√ºrich and promptly used to triangulate the city. Basel and Geneva became important printing centres, with an output equal to that of e.g. Strasbourg or Lyon. Their printing reformatory tracts greatly furthered the dissemination of these ideas. First newspapers appeared towards the end of the 16th century, but disappeared soon again due to the censorship of the absolutist authorities. In architecture, there was a strong Italian and especially florentine influence, visible in many a rich magistrate's town house. Famed baroque architect Francesco Borromini was born 1599 in the Ticino. Many Huguenots and other Protestant refugees from all over Europe fled to Basel, Geneva, and Neuch√¢tel. Geneva under Calvin and his successor Theodore Beza demanded their naturalisation and strict adherence to the Calvinist doctrine, whereas Basel, where the university had re-opened in 1532, became a center of intellectual freedom. Many of these immigrants were skilled craftsmen or businessmen and contributed greatly to the development of banking and the watch industry.

Member cantons are shown in green, associates in brown, condominiums in grey. The early modern history of the Old Swiss Confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft, also known as the \\"Swiss Republic\\" or Republica Helvetiorum) and its constituent Thirteen Cantons encompasses the time of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) until the French invasion of 1798. The early modern period was characterized by an increasingly aristocratic and oligarchic ruling class as well as frequent economic or religious revolts. This period came to be referred to as the Ancien R√©gime retrospectively, in post-Napoleonic Switzerland. The loosely organized Confederation remained generally disorganized and crippled by the religious divisions created by the Swiss Reformation. During this period the Confederation gained formal independence from the Holy Roman Empire with support from France, and had very close relations with France. The early modern period also saw the growth of French-Swiss literature, and notable authors of the Age of Enlightenment such as the mathematicians of the Bernoulli family and Leonhard Euler of Basel. Thirteen Cantons 1724 depiction of the thirteen cantonal coats of arms. The Old Swiss Confederacy between phases of expansion consisted of Eight Cantons () during 1352‚Äì1481, and of the Thirteen Cantons () from 1513 until its collapse in 1798. The Thirteen Cantons thus correspond to the sovereign territories of Early Modern Switzerland. They were listed in a fixed order of precedence, first the eight, old cantons of the \\"Alliance of the Eight Cantons\\" () of the 14th century confederacy, then the five cantons which joined after the Burgundian Wars, and within these two groups, the more powerful urban cantons (, \\"cities\\") were listed first, with Z√ºrich heading the list as the de facto Vorort of the Eight Cantons prior to the Swiss Reformation.Im Hof, U.. Geschichte der Schweiz, 7th ed., Stuttgart: Kohlhammer Verlag, 1974/2001. . The order of precedence, similar but not identical to the modern order (which lists Zug after Glarus, and Basel after Solothurn), was as follows: # 20px Zurich, city canton, since 1351 # 20px Berne, city canton, since 1353; associate since 1323 # 20px Lucerne, city canton, since 1332 # 20px Uri, founding canton (Pact of Brunnen 1315) # 20px Schwyz, founding canton (Pact of Brunnen 1315) # 20px 20px Unterwalden, founding canton (Pact of Brunnen 1315)the old coat of arms of Unterwalden was identical with that of Solothurn; the new coat of arms was introduced in the 17th century. # 20px Zug, city canton, since 1352 # 21px Glarus, rural canton, since 1352 # 20px Basel, city canton, since 1501 # 20px Fribourg, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1454 # 20px Solothurn, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1353the coat of arms of Solothurn was identical with that of Unterwalden during the 16th and early 17th centuries, and therefore sometimes shown with inverted colours or asymmetric division of the shield for disambiguation. # 20px Schaffhausen, city canton, since 1501; associate since 1454 # 20px Appenzell, rural canton, since 1513; associate since 1411 Symbolic depictions of the Confederacy consisted of arrangements of the thirteen cantonal coats of arms, sometimes with an additional symbol of unity, such as two clasping hands, or the \\"Swiss Bull\\" or (from the later 17th century), the Three Confederates or the Helvetia allegory. The cantonal coats of arms were often accompanied by the coats of arms of the close associates of the confederacy, including Biel, the Imperial Abbey of St. Gallen, Imperial City of St. Gallen, the Sieben Zenden (Valais), the Three Leagues (Grisons), the Imperial City of Mulhouse, the Imperial City of Geneva and the Imperial City of Rottweil. Thirty Years War The Reformation in Switzerland left the Old Swiss Confederacy divided between two hostile factions. But still, Switzerland remained a relative \\"oasis of peace and prosperity\\" (Grimmelshausen) while Europe was torn by the Thirty Years' War. The cities generally lay low and watched the destruction from afar, the Republic of Z√ºrich investing in building state-of-the-art city ramparts. The cantons had concluded numerous mercenary contracts and defence alliances with partners on all sides. Some of these contracts neutralized each other, which allowed the confederation to remain neutral ‚Äì in the 1647 Defensionale von Wil, signed under the impression of the Swedes advancing as far as Lake Constance in the winter of 1646/47, the confederates declared \\"permanent armed neutrality\\", the historical starting point of Swiss neutrality, which would be re-confirmed by the Congress of Vienna and adhered to throughout the 19th and 20th century conflicts. Religious division of the Old Confederacy during the 17th and 18th centuries Treaty of Westphalia At the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Swiss Confederacy attained legal independence from the Holy Roman Empire, although it had been de facto independent since the Swabian War in 1499. With the support of the Duke of Orl√©ans, who was also prince of Neuch√¢tel and the head of the French delegation, Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the mayor of Basel, succeeded in getting a formal exemption from the empire for all cantons and associates of the confederacy. During the Thirty Years' War, the Drei B√ºnde (Graub√ºnden, an associate state of the Swiss Confederation) had been caught in the middle of internal and external conflict. Because the Leagues were very decentralized, conflicts over religion and foreign policy broke out during the war (known as the B√ºndner Wirren or Confusion of the Leagues). Following the war the League took steps to strengthen itself. The Valtellina, which had broken from the Three Leagues, became a dependency once again after the Treaty and remained so until the founding of the Cisalpine Republic by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797. Relationships with France The Confederation, shown within Europe in 1700 Following the Thirty Years' War, as France grew into a great power in Europe, the newly independent Confederation turned to France for trade and protection. In 1663, the Confederation agreed to a new treaty with France which granted Swiss mercenaries certain rights and protections as well as promised French neutrality in Swiss religious conflicts. However, as a consequence of this treaty Switzerland could do nothing when Louis XIV took Alsace (in 1648), Franche-Comt√© (in 1678 during the Franco-Dutch War) and Strasbourg (in 1681). Following Louis XIV's revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which granted rights to Protestants, the Protestant cantons began to favor military service with the Protestant Dutch who were fighting a series of wars against several European powers including France. In 1707, following the death of Marie de Nemours, Duchess of Nemours and Princess of Neuch√¢tel, the city, which was on the border of the Swiss Confederation, had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. While Louis XIV promoted a number of French pretenders to the title, the Protestant cantons of the Swiss Confederation encouraged Neuch√¢tel to select the Protestant King Frederick I of Prussia. In a victory for the Protestant half of the Confederation, Frederick I, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau, was selected. In 1715, the Catholic cantons, to regain prestige following their defeat during the Second Battle of Villmergen, renewed the Confederation's treaty with France with several major and unpopular changes. France was placed in the position of the guarantor of their freedom with rights of interfering in case of attack from forces within or without the Confederation. France also promised to procure restitution for the lands lost by the Catholic cantons to the Protestant cantons. This agreement removed much of the independence that the Confederation had enjoyed. In 1777, the unpopular clause was dropped from a renewed agreement between the Confederation and France and the independence of Switzerland was explicitly stated. Growth of the aristocracy The concentration of wealth among the aristocrats allowed art such as this ballot box from Neuch√¢tel to be created, Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire (Neuch√¢tel) Political power congealed around the 13 cantons (Bern, Z√ºrich, Zug, Glarus, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel, Luzern, Schaffhausen, Appenzell) of the old confederation. During this era, the patrician families decreased in number but increased in power. Some patrician families were drawn from leadership in the guilds or trading groups within the town, while other families grew from successful mercenary captains and soldiers. The trend toward increasing authoritarianism conflicted with the history of public expression that grew out of the Swiss Reformation. In many regions the patrician families were unable to suppress the public assemblies, but they did dominate the assemblies. The tradition of inviting the people to express their opinions died out mostly during this era. During this time, changes to the membership of city councils became increasingly rare. Throughout the Middle Ages a seat on the town council was normally a lifetime appointment.Fl√ºeler, p. 93 However, plagues, battlefield deaths, and conflicts over the Reformation guaranteed a regular turnover in the city councils. During the early modern era, growing scientific knowledge and relative peace reduced the number of open seats in the cities. At the same time, council members were increasingly able to fill the council with relatives. The population in Europe began to expand again following the Thirty Years' War. This led to population pressure that hadn't been experienced in several generations. For protection and help against the rising number of immigrants and landless peasants, many villages began to draw closer to neighboring towns, eventually coming under the authority of the larger towns. During the 17th century seats in the councils became increasingly hereditary. There were between 50 and 200 families that controlled all the key political, military, and industrial positions in Switzerland. In Bern out of 360 burgher families only 69 still had any power and could be elected by the end of the 18th century. However, the aristocracy remained generally open, and in some cities new families were accepted if they were successful and rich enough. Conflict and Revolution During the Ancien R√©gime the nobility of Switzerland grew in power becoming nearly absolute rulers. Among the population the loss of power, growing taxes, conflicts between rural and urban populations and religious conflicts all lead to uprisings and conflicts throughout the Confederation. During the Thirty Years' War, the Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action. This allowed the Swiss economy to flourish as war ravaged neighbors bought food and equipment from the Confederacy. However, following the end of the war the German economy recovered and demand for Swiss exports dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems. URL last accessed 16 August 2006. For cities the war had brought both prosperity and new expenses. The cities required new defenses such as new bastions. During the war France and Spain had paid Pensions, the agreed sums in return for the cantons providing them with mercenary regiments. With the end of the war this money had to be replaced. Taxes were raised and new ones were created. Additionally, less valuable copper coins called Batzen were minted. The Batzen had, however, the same face value as the previously minted silver money. The population began hoarding the silver coins, and the cheap copper money that remained in circulation continually lost its purchasing power. At the end of the war, the population thus faced both a postwar depression and a high inflation, combined with high taxes. This financial crisis led to a series of tax revolts in several cantons of the Confederacy, for instance 1629‚Äì36 in Lucerne, 1641 in Bern, or 1645/46 in Z√ºrich. The uprising in 1653 continued this series, but would take the conflict to an unprecedented level. Davel in front of the Ch√¢teau Saint-Maire in Lausanne In 1653, the largest uprising occurred as peasants of territories subject to Lucerne, Bern, Solothurn and Basel revolted because of currency devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this Swiss peasant war, they did pass some tax reforms and the incident in the long term prevented creation of an absolutist state, unlike many of the other states of Europe. The Confederation remained a decentralised and disorganised country during this era, torn by religious and political conflicts. In 1655, an attempt to create a central administration fell apart after the two proposers, Bern and Z√ºrich, couldn't agree with each other. In 1656, a conflict over religious refugees from Schwyz who had fled to Z√ºrich erupted in the First War of Villmergen. The Catholics were victorious and able to maintain their political dominance, and a treaty agreement that each canton would be totally independent with respect to religious matters. Around 1707 unrest erupted in the city of Geneva which continued throughout the early modern period. Additionally in 1707, the Toggenburg valley rebelled against the Prince-Abbot of St. Gall. Attempts by the Abbot to suppress the valley led to the Second Battle of Villmergen in 1712 and the sacking of the Abbey of St. Gall by Bernese and Z√ºrich troops. From 1719‚Äì22 the Werdenberg region rebelled against the city of Glarus. In 1717, Major Jean Daniel Abraham Davel was appointed the commander of the Lavaux region, which is in modern-day Canton Vaud. He identified with the French-speaking population that felt oppressed by the German-speaking city of Bern that occupied Vaud. Davel believed that he had been called by God to free the inhabitants of Vaud from Bern. On 31 March 1723 he mobilised 600 men and marched on Lausanne to ask the city leaders to revolt with him. However, they reported him to Bern and arrested him on the next morning. He was judged guilty of treason and beheaded. About a quarter century later, in 1749, there was another unsuccessful uprising in Bern against the patrician families of the city. A few years later, in 1755, the unsuccessful Liviner Uprising against Uri. Finally in 1781 the Chenaux Uprising occurred against the city of Fribourg. Age of Enlightenment The Age of Enlightenment was well received in Swiss cities, in spite of contemporary tendencies towards political conservatism. The early modern period was a time when Swiss science and literature flowered. In Z√ºrich the scholar and physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer wrote about Swiss history, geology, geography and science. In Basel the Bernoulli family and Leonhard Euler worked on mathematics and physics, coming up with some fundamental concepts in these fields. Albrecht von Haller and Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised the natural beauty and unspoiled state of Switzerland and triggered an early wave of tourism (notably, Goethe's visit to Switzerland in 1775). Z√ºrich at the time was home to a number of internationally known scholars, such as Johann Jakob Bodmer, Salomon Gessner, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Johann Caspar Lavater, styling itself as \\"Republic\\" (after the great city states of the time, such as the Republic of Venice). Culture during the early modern period Before the early modern period most of the literature of the Swiss Confederation was either in Latin or German as until 1798 the confederation was overwhelmingly German with only small pockets of French. During the early modern period German still dominated though French, Italian and Romansh began to develop literary traditions within the boundaries of modern Switzerland. German writings Old Swiss 10 Franc Banknote honouring Leonhard Euler who developed many key concepts in mathematics, calculus, physics and engineering. In the 18th century the intellectual movement in Switzerland greatly developed, though it was naturally strongly influenced by local characteristics. Basel, Bern and especially Z√ºrich were the chief literary centres. Basel was distinguished for its mathematicians, such as Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783), and three members of the Bernoulli family, the brothers Jakob (1654‚Äì1705) and Johann (1667‚Äì1748), and the latter's son Daniel (1700‚Äì1782). But its chief literary glory was Isaak Iselin (1728‚Äì1782), one of the founders of the Helvetic Society (1760) and of the Economical Society (1777). He wrote about the philosophy of history, ideal politics and economics. Air-flow over different shapes (a first step in developing wings for flight) was one of many subjects studied by the Bernoulli family in Switzerland In Bern both German and French were commonly used in writing, making the separation of Bernese authors into one category difficult. Albrecht von Haller wrote both scientific works as well as poems which praised the beauty of the countryside. His son Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller (1735‚Äì1786), compiled a useful bibliography of writings relating to Swiss history, which is still used today. Beat Ludwig von Muralt (1656‚Äì1749) analysed, in French, the racial characteristics of other nations for the instruction of his fellow-countrymen. Samuel Wyttenbach (1748‚Äì1830), Gottlieb Sigmund Gruner and Johann Georg Altmann (1697‚Äì1758) all wrote descriptions of the countryside in a combination of literary and scientific styles. In Z√ºrich JJ Scheuchzer wrote in Latin of his travels around the country, and shared them with the London Royal Society of which he was a Fellow. He associated closely with other Fellows of the Royal Society, including Isaac Newton. JJ Bodmer and his friend Johann Jakob Breitinger (1701‚Äì1776) were among the most prominent purely literary writers in the city. Another famous Z√ºrich writer was Solomon Gesner, the pastoral poet, and yet another was JK Lavater, now best remembered as a supporter of the view that the face presents a perfect indication of character and that physiognomy may therefore he treated as a science. Other well-known Z√ºrich names are those of JH Pestalozzi (1746‚Äì1827), the educationalist, of Hans Caspar Hirzel (1725‚Äì1803), another of the founders of the Helvetic Society, and of Johann Georg Sulzer (1720‚Äì1779), whose chief work is one on the laws of art or aesthetics. Outside the three towns named above there were several significant writers of German-speaking Switzerland. One of the best known is Johann Georg Zimmermann (1728‚Äì1795), whose Betrachtungen fiber die Einsamkeit (1756-1784/1785) profoundly impressed his contemporaries. He, like the fabulist AE Erhlich, was born at Brugg. Johannes von M√ºller of Schaffhausen, was the first who attempted to write (1780) a detailed history of Switzerland, which, though inspired more by his love of freedom than by any deep research, was very characteristic of his times. JG Ebel was a Swiss by adoption only, but deserves mention as the author of the first detailed guidebook to the country (1793), which held its ground until the days of Murray and Baedeker. A later writer, Heinrich Zschokke (1771‚Äì1848), also a Swiss by adoption only, produced (1822) a history of Switzerland written for the people, which had a great vogue. French writing Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in Geneva during the 18th century The 18th century was the \\"golden age\\" for Swiss literature. This was due to the influence of French refugees who came to Switzerland after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Among the refugees was Louis Bourguet (1678‚Äì1743) who wrote geological works and founded two periodicals that provided Italian research and works by French Swiss authors to the country. Abraham Ruchat (1678‚Äì1750), who was published in Bourguet's periodicals, is best known as the author (under the pen-name of Gottlieb Kypseler) of an excellent guide-book to Switzerland, which was published from 1714 until 1778. Around the same time the historian Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat (1695‚Äì1754) and the philosopher JP de Crousaz (1663‚Äì1750), were working the Vaud region, which was at the time part of the Canton of Bern. A French refugee at Lausanne, Jean Barbeyrac (1674‚Äì1744), published in 1712 a translation of Samuel von Pufendorf's works on natural law. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694‚Äì1750) and the celebrated international lawyer Emeric de Vattel (1714 1767) were natives of Neuch√¢tel, though de Vattle only returned to die in the city. Voltaire wrote Candide: Or, Optimism one of his best known works while in Switzerland The second half of the 18th century was when some of the best known writers of the era established themselves in what would become French Switzerland. In 1754, the famed philosopher Rousseau came back for good to Geneva, and Voltaire established himself at Ferney, while in 1753 the historian Edward Gibbon moved to Lausanne. These three, while their works were not specifically Swiss, lead the golden age of French literature in Switzerland. Also during this time there were other active writers. Madame de Charri√®re (1740‚Äì1805) was Dutch by birth, but married to a native of Neuch√¢tel. She wrote of sad results of an unsuitable marriage and set her books in highly detailed small provincial towns. Paul Henri Mallet, a Genevese, who held a chair at Copenhagen, devoted himself to making known to the educated world the history and antiquities of Scandinavia. During the mid and late 18th century Geneva produced a number of scientists who were interested in the characteristics of the Alps. The chief of this school was Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure one of the founders of the sciences of geology and meteorology, while his Alpine ascents (undertaken in the cause of science) opened a new world even to non-scientific travellers. Jean-Andr√© Deluc devoted himself mainly to questions of physics in the Alps, while Jean S√©nebier, the biographer of Saussure, was more known as a physiologist than as a physicist, though he wrote on many branches of natural science, which in those days was not yet highly specialised. On the other hand, Marc Th√©odore Bourrit, the contemporary of these three men, was rather a curious and inquisitive traveller than a scientific investigator, and charms us even now by his genial simplicity as contrasted with the austerity and gravity of the three writers we have mentioned. In Vaud, at this time part of the Canton of Bern, nationalist feelings among the French-speaking inhabitants and against the German-speaking Bern administration began to grow. Philippe Cyriaque Bridel (1757‚Äì1845), began writing poetry in 1782 and is considered the earliest Vaudois poet. His descriptions of his travels around the Vaud region were published in serial form for nearly 50 years, from 1783 until 1831. His paintings and written portraits of the Vaud countryside inspired a number of later writers and helped unify the nationalist movement in Vaud.

In 1798, Switzerland was completely overrun by the French and was renamed the Helvetic Republic. The Helvetic Republic encountered severe economic and political problems. In 1798 the country became a battlefield of the Revolutionary Wars, culminating in the Battles of Z√ºrich in 1799. In 1803 Napoleon's Act of Mediation reestablished a Swiss Confederation that partially restored the sovereignty of the cantons, and the former tributary and allied territories of Aargau, Thurgau, Graub√ºnden, St. Gallen, Vaud and Ticino became cantons with equal rights. The Congress of Vienna of 1815 fully re-established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality. At this time, the territory of Switzerland was increased for the last time, by the new cantons of Valais, Neuch√¢tel and Geneva. The Restoration, the time leading up to the Sonderbundskrieg, was marked with turmoil, and the rural population struggling against the yoke of the urban centres, for example in the Z√ºriputsch of 1839.

Flag of the Helvetic Republic During the last years of the Ancien R√©gime, the growing conflicts throughout the Confederation (aristocratic cities against peasant farmers, Protestant against Catholic, and canton against canton) had weakened and distracted the Diet. In Paris, the Helvetian Club, founded in 1790 by several exiled Vaudois and Fribourgers, was the centre from which the ideas of the French Revolution were spread in the western part of the Confederation. During the next eight years, revolts sprang up across the Confederation and, unlike earlier ones, many were successful. In 1790 the Lower Valais rose against the upper districts. In 1791, Porrentruy rebelled against the Bishop of Basel and became the Rauracian republic in November 1792 and in 1793, there was a rebellion in the French department of the Mont Terrible. In 1795, St Gallen successfully revolted against the prince-abbot. These revolts were supported or encouraged by France, but the French army did not directly attack the Confederation. However, following the French success in the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797) against the aristocratic armies of Prussia and Austria, the time had come for direct action against the aristocratic Ancien R√©gime in Switzerland. In 1797, the districts of Chiavenna, Valtellina, and Bormio, dependencies of the Three Leagues (an associate of the Confederation), revolted under the encouragement of France. They were quickly invaded and annexed to the Cisalpine Republic on 10 October 1797. In December of the same year, the Bishopric of Basel was occupied and annexed. On 9 December 1797, Fr√©d√©ric-C√©sar de La Harpe, a member of the Helvetian Club from Vaud, asked France to invade Bern to protect Vaud. Seeing a chance to remove a feudal neighbor and gain Bern's wealth, France agreed. By February 1798, French troops occupied Mulhouse and Biel/Bienne. Meanwhile, another army entered Vaud, and the Lemanic Republic was proclaimed. The Diet broke up in dismay without taking any steps to avert the coming storm. On 5 March, troops entered Bern, deserted by her allies and distracted by quarrels within. With Bern, the stronghold of the aristocratic party, in revolutionary hands, the old Confederation collapsed. Within a month, the Confederation was under French control, and all the associate members of the Confederation were gone. Helvetic Republic Helvetic Republic, with borders as at the Second Helvetic constitution of 25 May 1802 On 12 April 1798 121 cantonal deputies proclaimed the Helvetic Republic, \\"One and Indivisible\\". The new r√©gime abolished cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights. The occupying forces established a centralised state based on the ideas of the French Revolution. Before the Helvetic Republic, each individual canton had exercised complete sovereignty over its own territory or territories. Little central authority had existed, with matters concerning the country as a whole confined mainly to the Diet, a meeting of leading representatives from the cantons. Histoire de la Suisse, √âditions Fragni√®re, Fribourg, Switzerland The constitution of the Helvetic Republic came mainly from the design of Peter Ochs, a magistrate from Basel. It established a central two-chamber legislature which included the Grand Council (with 8 members per canton) and the Senate (4 members per canton). The executive, known as the Directory, comprised 5 members. The Constitution also established actual Swiss citizenship, as opposed to just citizenship of one's canton of birth. With Swiss citizenship came the absolute freedom to settle in any canton, the political communes were now composed of all residents, and not merely of the burghers. However, the community land and property remained with the former local burghers who were gathered together into the B√ºrgergemeinde. No general agreement existed about the future of Switzerland. Leading groups split into the Unitaires, who wanted a united republic, and the Federalists, who represented the old aristocracy and demanded a return to cantonal sovereignty. Coup-attempts became frequent, and the new r√©gime had to rely on the French to survive. Furthermore, the occupying forces plundered many towns and villages. This made it difficult to establish a new working state. Many Swiss citizens resisted these \\"progressive\\" ideas, particularly in the central areas of the country. Some of the more controversial aspects of the new regime limited freedom of worship, which outraged many of the more devout citizens. Several uprisings took place, with the three Forest Cantons (Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) rebelling in early 1798. The Schwyzers, under Alois von Reding, were crushed by the French on the heights of Morgarten in April and May, as were the Unterwaldners in August and September. Due to the destruction and plundering, the Swiss soon turned against the French. After the Forest Cantons uprising, some cantons were merged, thus reducing their anti-centralist effectiveness in the legislature. Uri, Schwyz, Zug and Unterwalden together became the canton of Waldst√§tten; Glarus and the Sarganserland became the canton of Linth, and Appenzell and St. Gallen combined as the canton of S√§ntis. French Revolutionary Wars in Switzerland In 1799, Switzerland became a battle-zone between the French, Austrian and Imperial Russian armies, with the locals supporting mainly the latter two, rejecting calls to fight with the French armies in the name of the Helvetic Republic. Battle of Winterthur The Battle of Winterthur (27 May 1799) was an important action between elements of the Army of the Danube, Massena's Army of Switzerland, and elements of the Habsburg army, commanded by the Swiss-born Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. Winterthur lies northeast of Z√ºrich. Because of its position at the junction of seven cross-roads, the army that held the town controlled access to most of Switzerland and points crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. Hotze's troops arrived in the morning at the outskirts of Winterthur and immediately attacked Ney's position. By afternoon, his troops had joined those of Nauendorf and Archduke Charles, marked in yellow. With the first elements of both Austrian armies having already linked up during the Battle of Frauenfeld two days earlier; Mass√©na sent the newly promoted General of Division Michel Ney and part of the Army of the Danube to Winterthur on 27 May to stop the Austrian advance from eastern Switzerland. If the Austrians succeeded in uniting Hotze's army from the east with Nauendorf's directly north of Zurich, and Archduke Charles' which lay to the north and west, the French would be dangerously encircled at Zurich.Shadwell, p. 108; Smith, Clash at Winterthur. pp. 156‚Äì157. On the morning of 27 May, Hotze assembled his force into three columns and marched toward Winterthur. Opposite him, Michel Ney deployed his force around the heights, the so-called Ober-Winterthur, a ring of low-lying hills some north of the city. The overall commander of the forward line, Jean Victor Tharreau, had informed Ney that he would send Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division to support him; Ney understood this to mean he was to make a stand along the entire outpost line, and that he would not be isolated. He expected his small force would receive reinforcements from Soult's division. Consequently, Ney directed the weakest brigade, under the command of Th√©odore Maxime Gazan, to move up a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another brigade, under the command of Dominique Mansuy Roget, to take the right, preventing any Austrian flanking maneuver.Shadwell, p. 108. By mid-morning, Hotze's advanced guard had encountered moderate French resistance first from the two brigades Ney had at his disposal.Atteridge, p. 46. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran the weaker brigade and took possession of the woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third angled to the French right, as Ney had expected he would. Soult never appeared (he was later court-martialed for insubordination) and Ney withdrew his forces through Winterthur, regrouping with Tharreau's main force in the outskirts of Zurich.Blanning, p. 233; Shadwell, p. 108. A day later, Hotze's force united with the main Austrian force of Archduke Charles.Smith, Clash at Winterthur. pp. 156‚Äì157. Battles for Z√ºrich In the First Battle of Z√ºrich, on 4‚Äì7 June 1799, approximately 45,000 French and 53,000 Austrians clashed on the plains around the city. On the left wing, Hotze had 20 battalions of infantry, plus support artillery, and 27 squadrons of cavalry, in total, 19,000 men. On the right wing, General Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf commanded another 18,000.Smith, p. 158. The battle cost both sides dearly; General of Brigade Cherin was killed, on the French side, and on the Austrian side, Feldzeugmeister (General of Infantry) Olivier, Count of Wallis, was killed. On the French side, 500 died, 800 were wounded and 300 captured; on the Austrian side, 730 killed, 1,470 wounded, and 2,200 captured. When the Austrians took the French positions in the city, they also captured over 150 guns.Smith reports that the casualty figures are controversial. Smith, p. 158. Ultimately, French general Andr√© Mass√©na yielded the city to the Austrians, under Archduke Charles. Massena retreated beyond the river Limmat, where he managed to fortify his positions. Katja H√ºrlimann, (Johann Konrad) Friedrich von Hotze in Lexikon der Schweiz. 15/01/2008 edition, accessed 18 October 2009'; Blanning, pp. 233‚Äì234. Hotze's force harassed their retreat, and secured the river shoreline. Jens-Florian Ebert. Freiherr von Hotze. Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Accessed 15 October 2009; Katja H√ºrlimann, (Johann Konrad) Friedrich von Hotze; Blanning, pp. 233‚Äì34. Despite Hotze's aggressive harassment of the French retreat, Charles did not follow up on the withdrawal; Mass√©na established himself on the opposite bank of the Limmat without threat of pursuit from the main body of the Austrian Army, much to the annoyance of the Russian liaison officer, Alexander Ivanovich, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy.Smith, 158. On 14 August 1799, a Russian force of 6,000 cavalry, 20,000 infantry, and 1,600 Cossacks, under Alexander Korsakov, joined Archduke Charles' force in Schaffhausen.Rothenberg, p. 74. In a vice-like operation, together with the Russians, they would surround Andr√© Mass√©na's smaller army on the banks of the Limmat, where it had taken refuge the previous spring. To divert this attack, General Claude Lecourbe, attacked the pontoon bridges over which the Austrians crossed the Rhine, destroying most of them, and making the rest unusable. H√ºrlimann, \\"(Johann Konrad) Friedrich von Hotze. Mass√©na at the Second Battle of Zurich Before Charles could regroup, orders arrived from the Aulic Council, the imperial body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to countermand his plan;Blanning, p. 252. Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation as long as he could, but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander. Charles withdrew his force to the north of the Rhine. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, they were too late to reverse.Blanning, p. 253. In the Second Battle of Z√ºrich, the French regained control of the city, along with the rest of Switzerland. Notably, Massena out-generaled Korsakov; surrounded him, tricked him, and then took more than half his army prisoner, plus captured the baggage train and most of his cannons, and inflicted over 8,000 casualties.Thiers, p. 400‚Äì401. Most of the fighting took place on both banks of the Limmat up to the gates of Z√ºrich, and part within the city itself. Z√ºrich had declared itself neutral, and was spared general destruction. General Nicolas Oudinot commanded the French forces on the right bank and General √âdouard Mortier, those on the left.Blanning, p. 253; H√ºrlimann, \\"(Johann Konrad) Friedrich von Hotze\\"; Longworth, p. 270. On the same day, Jean-de-Dieu Soult and about 10,000 troops faced Hotze and 8,000 Allies in the Battle of Linth River. Soult sent 150 volunteers to swim the river in the middle of the night. Most carried a saber in their teeth and a pistol and cartridges tied to their heads; others carried drums or bugles. These soldiers killed the Austrian sentries, overran an outpost, made much confusing noise, and signaled Soult's main force to cross in boats. Hotze was killed during this maneuver when Soult's men surprised him on an early morning reconnaissance.Lina Hug and Richard Stead. Switzerland. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902, p. 361; Thiers, p. 401‚Äì402. Franz Petrasch assumed command but his troops were badly beaten and forced to retreat, losing 3,500 prisoners, 25 field guns, and four colors. While Mass√©na and Soult were drubbing the Allies, Alexander Suvorov's 21,285 Russians arrived in Switzerland from Italy. In the Battle of Gotthard Pass from 24‚Äì26 September, Suvorov's army pushed aside Lecourbe's 8,000 troops and reached Altdorf near Lake Lucerne. From there, Suvorov led his army across the Kinzig Pass hoping to make a junction with the other Allied forces. At Muotathal, Suvorov finally learned that disaster had overtaken the Allied forces and that his army was marooned. The Russians broke out of the trap and were at St. Gallen in early October. Suvorov was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.Longworth, pp. 270‚Äì271. Civil war and the end of the Republic 16 Frank coin issued by the Helvetic Republic, this represents the first national coinage of Switzerland. Instability in the Republic reached its peak in 1802‚Äì03‚Äîincluding the Stecklikrieg civil war of 1802. Together with local resistance, financial problems caused the Helvetic Republic to collapse, and its government took refuge in Lausanne. Due to the instability of the situation, the Helvetic Republic had over six constitutions in a period of four years. At that time Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul of France, summoned representatives of both sides to Paris in order to negotiate a solution. Although the Federalist representatives formed a minority at the conciliation conference, known as the \\"Helvetic Consulta\\"; Bonaparte characterised Switzerland as federal \\"by nature\\" and considered it unwise to force the area into any other constitutional framework. On 19 February 1803, the Act of Mediation restored the cantons. With the abolition of the centralized state, Switzerland became a confederation once again. The period of the Helvetic Republic is still very controversial within Switzerland. It represents the first time that Switzerland as a unified country existed and a step toward the modern federal state. For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden it was a time of military defeat followed by occupation. In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished. Act of Mediation The Swiss Confederation was re-established as a result of the Act of Mediation issued by Napoleon Bonaparte on 19 February 1803 in the aftermath of the Stecklikrieg. The period of Swiss history from 1803 to 1815 is itself known as Mediation. The act abolished the previous Helvetic Republic, which had existed since the invasion of Switzerland by French troops in March 1798. After the withdrawal of French troops in July 1802, the Republic collapsed (Stecklikrieg). The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the Ancien R√©gime and a Republic. This intermediary stage of Swiss history lasted until the Restoration of 1815. In 1803 Napoleon's Act of Mediation partially restored the sovereignty of the cantons, and the former subject territories of Aargau, Thurgau, Vaud, and Ticino became cantons with equal rights. Likewise, the Three Leagues, formerly an associate (Zogewandter Ort) but not a full member of the confederacy, became a full member as the canton of Graub√ºnden. The city of St. Gallen, also historically an associate of the confederacy, along with its own former subject territories (and with those formerly belonging to the Abbey of Saint Gall) became a full member as the canton of St. Gallen, for a total of nineteen cantons. In contrast, the territories of Biel, Valais, the former Principality of Neuch√¢tel (the later canton of Neuch√¢tel), of the Bishopric of Basel (the later Bernese Jura), and of Geneva did not become part of the Swiss confederacy until the end of the Napoleonic era. Act of Mediation, 1803 With Napoleon acting as a mediator and declaring that the natural political state of the Swiss is a Federation, the Act of Mediation dissolved the Helvetic Republic and addressed many of the issues that had torn the Republic apart. It restored the original Thirteen Cantons of the old Confederation and added six new cantons, two (St Gallen and Graub√ºnden or Grisons) having been formerly associates, and the four others being made up of the subject lands conquered at different times ‚Äî Aargau (1415), Thurgau (1460), Ticino (1440, 1500, 1512), and Vaud (1536). The Act of Mediation consists of nineteen separate constitutions for the nineteen sovereign cantons, ordered alphabetically, followed by a \\"Federal Act\\" (Acte F√©d√©ral, pp. 101-109) detailing mutual obligations between the cantons and provisions for the Federal Diet. In the Diet, six cantons which had a population of more than 100,000 (Bern, Zurich, Vaud, St Gallen, Graub√ºnden and Aargau) were given two votes, the others having but one apiece. Meetings of the Diet were to be held alternately at Fribourg, Bern, Solothurn, Basel, Z√ºrich and Lucerne. The Landsgemeinden, or popular assemblies, were restored in the democratic cantons, the cantonal governments in other cases being in the hands of a great council (legislative) and the small council (executive). There were to be no privileged classes, burghers or subject lands. Every Swiss citizen was to be free to move and settle anywhere in the new Confederation. However the rights promised in the Act of Mediation soon began to erode. In 1806 the principality of Neuch√¢tel was given to Marshal Berthier. Ticino was occupied by French troops from 1810 to 1813. Also, in 1810 the Valais was occupied and converted into the French department of the Simplon to secure the Simplon Pass. At home the liberty of moving from one canton to another (though given by the constitution) was, by the Diet in 1805, restricted by requiting ten years' residence, and then not granting political rights in the canton or a right of profiting by the communal property. As soon as Napoleon's power began to wane (1812‚Äì1813), the position of Switzerland became endangered. The Austrians, supported by the reactionary party in Switzerland, and without any real resistance on the part of the Diet, crossed the border on 21 December 1813. On 29 December under pressure from Austria, the Diet abolished the 1803 constitution which had been created by Napoleon in the Act of Mediation. 40 Batzen coin of Vaud (1812) Franken coin of Luzern (1814) On 6 April 1814 the so-called Long Diet met to replace the constitution. The Diet remained dead-locked until 12 September when Valais, Neuch√¢tel and Geneva were raised to full members of the Confederation. This increased the number of cantons to 22. The Diet, however, made little progress until the Congress of Vienna. Restoration On 20 March 1815 Bern was given the town of Biel/Bienne and much of the land that had been owned by the Bishop of Basel as compensation for territory lost during the Long Diet. The Valtellina, formerly owned by Graubunden, was granted to Austria. Muhlhausen (Mulhouse in French) was left as part of France. On 7 August 1815, the Federal Treaty went into force and the new constitution was sworn to by all the cantons except Nidwalden.Wilhelm Oechsli, History of Switzerland 1499-1914, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 368. Nidwalden only agreed under military force on 30 August and as punishment lost Engelberg to Obwalden. By the new constitution the sovereign rights of each canton were fully recognized, and a return made to the lines of the old constitution, though there were to be no subject lands, and political rights were not to be the exclusive privilege of any class of citizens. Each canton had one vote in the Diet, where an absolute majority was to decide all matters save foreign affairs, when a majority of three-fourths was required.

The constitution, which was heavily influenced by the United States Constitution and the ideas of the French Revolution, was modified several times during the following decades and wholly replaced in 1999. The 1848 constitution represented the first time, other than when the short-lived Helvetic Republic had been imposed, that the Swiss had a central government instead of being simply a collection of autonomous cantons bound by treaties. Sonderbundskrieg  The federal troops during the Sonderbund war In 1847, the period of Swiss history known as Restoration ended with the breaking out of a war between the conservative Roman Catholic and the liberal Protestant cantons (the Sonderbundskrieg). The conflict between the Catholic and Protestant cantons had existed since the Reformation; in the 19th century the Protestant population had a majority. In 1850, the population was 59.3% Protestant and 40.6% Catholic The Sonderbund (German: separate alliance) was concluded after the Radical Party had taken power in Switzerland and had, thanks to the Protestant majority of cantons, taken measures against the Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in Aargau in 1841. When Lucerne, in retaliation, recalled the Jesuits the same year, groups of armed radicals (\\"Freisch√§rler\\") invaded the canton. This caused a revolt, mostly because rural cantons were strongholds of ultramontanism. The Sonderbund was in violation of the Federal Treaty of 1815, ¬ß6, which expressly forbade such separate alliances, and the Radical majority in the Tagsatzung decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on 21 October 1847. The confederate army was raised against the members of the Sonderbund, composed of soldiers of all the other states except Neuch√¢tel and Appenzell Innerrhoden, which had stayed neutral. Ticino, while a Catholic canton, did not join the Sonderbund and fought with the Protestants. The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties. Apart from small riots,notably the shooting of 13 demonstrators by the Swiss Army in Geneva in 1932 this was the last armed conflict on Swiss territory. At the end of the Sonderbund War, the Diet began to debate a new federal constitution drawn up by Johann Conrad Kern (1808‚Äì1888) of Thurgau and Henri Druey (1790‚Äì1855) of Vaud. In the summer of 1848 this constitution was accepted by fifteen and a half cantons, with Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Valais, Ticino and Appenzell Innerrhoden opposing. The new constitution was declared on 12 September 1848. Federal Constitution 1848 Constitution The Federal Constitution of 1848 The new constitution created, for the first time, Swiss citizenship in addition to cantonal citizenship. A federal central government was set up to which the cantons gave up certain parts of their sovereign rights, retaining the rest. The Federal Assembly was made up of two houses- Council of States (St√§nderat), composed of two deputies from each canton (44 members at the time) and the National Council (Nationalrat) made up of deputies elected three years, in the proportion of one for every 20,000 citizens or fraction over 10,000 from each canton. The Federal Council or executive (Bundesrat) consisted of seven members elected by the Federal Assembly. In the 1848 Constitution, the entire Federal Council was granted the \\"supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation\\".Cst. art. 174 Each member of the Federal Council heads one of seven executive departments. The chairman of the Council also holds the title of President of the Swiss Confederation for a one-year term, with the position rotating among the members of the Federal Council. The judiciary (Bundesgericht) was made up of eleven members elected for three years by the Federal Assembly. The Bundesgericht was chiefly confined to civil cases in which the Confederation was a party, but also took in great political crimes. All constitutional questions are however reserved for the Federal Assembly. A federal university and a polytechnic school were to be founded. All capitulations were forbidden in the future. All cantons were required to treat Swiss citizens who belonged to one of the Christian confessions like their own citizens. Previously, citizens of one canton regarded citizens of the others as the citizens of foreign countries. All Christians were guaranteed the exercise of their religion but the Jesuits and similar religious orders were not to be received in any canton. German, French and Italian were recognized as national languages. Although there was now a fully organized central government, Switzerland was a very decentralized federation. Most authority remained with the cantons, including all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government. One of the first acts of the Federal Assembly was to exercise the power given them of determining the home of the Federal authorities (the de facto capital of the newly created confederation), and on 28 November 1848 Bern was chosen. The first Federal Council sat on 16 November 1848, composed entirely of members of the Free Democratic Party. Some of the first acts of the new Federal Assembly were to unify and standardize daily life in the country. In 1849 a uniform postal service was established. In 1850 a single currency was imposed to replace the cantonal currencies, while all customs between cantons were abolished. In 1851 the telegraph was organized, while all weights and measures were unified. In 1868 the metric system was allowed and in 1875 declared obligatory and universal. In 1854 roads and canals taken in hand were taken under federal control. The Federal Polytechnic wasn't opened until 1855 in Zurich, though the Federal university authorized by the new constitution has not yet been set up. In 1859, Reisl√§uferei (mercenary service) was outlawed, with the exception of the Vatican guard. In 1866 the rights granted only to Christians (free movement and freedom of religion) under the 1848 Constitution were extended to all Swiss regardless of religion. 1874 Revised Constitution From 1848 onwards the cantons continually revised their constitutions, with most including the introduction of the referendum, by which laws made by the cantonal legislature may (facultative referendum) or must (obligatory referendum) be submitted to the people for their approval. It was therefore only natural that attempts should be made to revise the federal constitution of 1848 in a democratic and centralizing sense, for it had been provided that the Federal Assembly, on its own initiative or on the written request of 50,000 Swiss electors, could submit the question of revision to a popular vote. The first attempt at a revision in 1872 was defeated by a small majority, owing to the efforts of the anti-centralizing party. Finally, however, another draft was preferred, and on the 19 April 1874, the new constitution was accepted by the people ‚Äì 14 cantons against 7 (those of 1848 without Ticino, but with Fribourg and Lucerne). The Constitution of 1874 further strengthened the federal power. The revised Constitution included three major points. First, a system of free elementary education was set up, under the superintendence of the Confederation, but managed by the cantons. Second, a man settling in another canton was, after three months (instead of two years in the 1848 Constitution), given all cantonal and communal rights (formerly only cantonal rights were granted). Finally, the referendum was introduced in its \\"facultative\\" form; i.e., all federal laws must be submitted to popular vote on the demand of 30,000 Swiss citizens or of eight cantons. The Initiative (i.e., the right of compelling the legislature to consider a certain subject or bill) was not introduced into the Federal Constitution until 1891 (when it was given to 50,000 Swiss citizens) and then only as to a partial (not a total) revision of that constitution. Industrialisation and economic growth The 1847 to 1914 period saw the development of the Swiss railway network. The Schweizerische Nordbahn (SNB) society opened the first railway line on Swiss soil in 1847, connecting Z√ºrich and Baden. The Gotthard Rail Tunnel was completed in 1881. The Swiss watchmaking industry has its origins in the 18th century, but boomed during the 19th century, turning the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds into an industrial center. Rapid urban growth also enlarged Z√ºrich, which incorporated its industrial suburb Aussersihl into the municipality in 1891.

See Early Modern Switzerland for the Early Modern period, Switzerland in the Napoleonic era for the period of 1798‚Äì1814, and Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland) for the period of 1815‚Äì1848. Formation of the Federal State (1848) Following a 27-day civil war in Switzerland, the Sonderbundskrieg, the Swiss Federal Constitution was passed on 12 September 1848. The constitution was heavily influenced by the US Constitution and the ideas of the French Revolution. The constitution establishes the Swiss Confederation, governed by a comparatively strong federal government, instead the model of a confederation of independent cantons bound by treaties. Industrialisation and economic growth (1848‚Äì1914) From 1847 to 1914, the Swiss railway network was developed. The Schweizerische Nordbahn (SNB) society opened the first railway line on Swiss soil in 1847, connecting Z√ºrich and Baden. The Gotthard Rail Tunnel was completed in 1881. The Swiss watchmaking industry has its origins in the 18th century, but boomed during the 19th century, turning the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds into an industrial center. Rapid urban growth also enlarged Z√ºrich, which incorporated its industrial suburb Aussersihl into the municipality in 1891. Banking emerged as a significant factor in Swiss economy with the foundation of the Union Bank of Switzerland in 1862, and the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1872. The Golden age of alpinism in the 1850s to 1860s lay the foundation to the tourism industry. World wars (1914‚Äì1945) During World War I and World War II, Switzerland maintained a stance of armed neutrality, and apart from minor skirmishes was not involved militarily. Because of its neutral status, Switzerland was of considerable interest to the warring parties, as a scene for diplomacy, espionage, commerce, and as a safe haven for refugees. During World War I, Switzerland was situated between the Central Powers to the north and east, and the Entente Powers to the south and west. During World War II, Switzerland was entirely surrounded by the Axis Powers from 1940 to 1944. 1945 to present Government From 1959, the Federal Council, elected by the parliament, is composed of members of the four major parties, the liberal Free Democrats, the Catholic Christian Democrats, the left-wing Social Democrats and the right-wing People's Party, essentially creating a system without a sizeable parliamentary opposition (see concordance system), reflecting the powerful position of an opposition in a direct democracy. Women were granted the right to vote in the first Swiss cantons in 1959, at the federal level in 1971Country profile: Switzerland UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Retrieved on 2009-11-25 and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden in 1990. After suffrage at the federal level women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven-member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp who served from 1984‚Äì1989. The first female president was Ruth Dreifuss, elected in 1998 to become president during 1999. The Swiss president is elected every year from those among the seven member high council and cannot serve two consecutive terms. During the Cold War, Swiss authorities considered the construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb.7.4 States Formerly Possessing or Pursuing Nuclear Weapons Retrieved March 6, 2014 Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Z√ºrich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In a nationwide referendum held in April 1962, the Swiss people chose not to prohibit nuclear arms in Switzerland. However, financial problems with the defense budget prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.Swiss nuclear bomb International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War October 9, 2010. Retrieved March 6, 2014 Domestic In 1979, parts of the Bernese Jura attained independence while remaining in the Federation, forming the new canton of Jura. The Demographics of Switzerland has changed in similar ways as in other states in Western Europe. Since 1945, the population of Switzerland has grown from roughly 4.5 to 7.5 million, mostly between 1945 and 1970, with a brief negative growth in the late 1970s, and a population growth hovering around 0.5% per year since the 1990s, mostly due to immigration. With a population composed of a roughly balanced combination of Roman Catholics and Protestants, together amounting to more than 95%, the population without any religious affiliation has grown to more than 10% in the 2000s, while the Muslim population grew from practically nil to some 4% over the past decades. Italians had been the largest group of resident foreigners since the 1920, but with the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, large-scale immigration of refugees has changed this picture, and residents with origins in the former Yugoslavia now constitute the largest group of resident foreigners, with some 200,000 people (roughly 3% of the population). Relations with the European Union With the exception of Liechtenstein, Switzerland has been completely surrounded by the European Union since 1995. Swiss-EU relations are a major issue in the country. Swiss voters narrowly rejected a December 1992 referendum to join the European Economic Area, with 50.3% of voters opposed. Swiss voters rejected EU membership in a March 2001 referendum, with 76.8% opposed. Despite Swiss opposition to joining the EU, voters have accepted bilateral agreements with the union. In a May 2000 referendum, for example, Swiss voters approved such agreements. In a June 2005 referendum, Swiss voters approved joining the Schengen Area. In February 2014, Swiss voters approved a referendum to reinstitute quotas on immigration to Switzerland, setting off a period of finding an implementation that would not violate the EU's freedom of movement accords that Switzerland adopted. Switzerland co-founded the European Free Trade Association in 1960, which is a parallel organization to the EU.

It is regarded as a national dish of Germany, and is frequently served in German- style restaurants internationally.Garrett 1898 It can be prepared from a variety of meats, most often from beef, but also from venison, lamb and mutton, pork and horse.Sheraton 1965, p. 147.Kummer 2007, p. 553.Casada 1996, p. 30. Before cooking, the raw meat is marinated for three to ten days in a mixture of vinegar or wine, water, herbs, spices, and seasonings. Usually, tougher cuts of meat such as rump roast or bottom round of beef are used, and the long marinating tenderizes the meat. A Sauerbraten dinner is almost always accompanied by a hearty gravy resulting from its roasting and is most often served with potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer), potato dumplings (Kartoffelkl√∂√üe), or Sp√§tzle pasta.Saekel 2005, F-5. Ingredients used in the marinade, and accompanyments served with Sauerbraten, vary across regions. Regional variants of the dish include those from Franconia, Thuringia, Rhineland, Saarland, Silesia, and Swabia. Etymology The name \\"Sauerbraten\\" is of German origin and means \\"sour roast\\". The word derives from Sauer meaning \\"sour\\" or \\"pickled\\" and Braten meaning \\"roast meat\\".The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th Ed.). (2006) History Julius Caesar has been assigned a role in the inspiration for sauerbraten as he sent amphoras filled with beef marinated in wine over the Alps to the newly founded Roman colony of Cologne. According to this legend (Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BC and the Roman city of Cologne was founded in 50 AD), this inspired the residents of Cologne to imitate the Roman import. While quite common, these claims are largely unsubstantiated. Several sources believe sauerbraten was invented by Charlemagne in the 9th century AD as a means of using leftover roasted meat.Herter 1995. Saint Albertus Magnus, also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, is also credited with popularizing the dish in the 13th century.April 2 Today's Events in Food History Sauerbraten was not originally made from horse meat, but this is done by many restaurants today, in the Rhineland, but most areas today sauerbraten is most often made from beef.Babcock 2002 p. 248. Regional variations Rheinischer Sauerbraten, in which raisins are added to provide a sweet balance to the sourness and acidity of the marinade There are many regional variants of sauerbraten. Many of the variations are in the ingredients used for the marinade in which the cut of meat is immersed for several days before cooking. Generally, the marinade's base is either red wine, vinegar, or a combination of both. While Germany largely produces white wines such as Riesling and Gew√ºrztraminer, regions of Germany that are closer to France often use red wine as the base for the marinade. Wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar and other varieties can be used as a base. Recipes from eastern regions of Germany closer to Poland and the Czech Republic tend to use vinegar as the base more frequently. In many regions, wine and vinegar are used together. * Rheinischer Sauerbraten is prepared in Germany's Rhineland region‚Äîalong the valley of the Rhine. Raisins and sometimes sugar beet syrup are added in cooking to provide sweetness to complement the sourness of the marinade.Hassani 2004, p. 156. Preparation Selection of the roast Sauerbraten can be made with many different kinds of roasting meat. Tougher, less expensive cuts of meat are used‚Äîtypically a rump roast or bottom round of beef. Venison or other game is often prepared as sauerbraten as the spices and vinegar take away the gamey taste of the meat.Schmidt 2003, p.94. Marinating the roast Sauerbraten marinating A solid cut from the bottom roundThe Culinary Institute of America Publisher 2006, p. 178. or rump is marinated for three or four days,Mitchell 1953, p. 106. or as many as ten,Sales 1977, p. 176. before cooking. Red wine vinegar and wine typically form the basis of the marinade, which also includes earthy aromatic spices such as peppercorns, juniper berries, cloves, nutmeg, and bay leaves and less commonly coriander, mustard seed, cinnamon, mace, ginger, and thyme.Sauerbraten Blend of Whole SpicesWood 1983, p.95. The marinade may also include vegetables such as onions, celery, and carrots. The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat before it cooks. Buttermilk is also used as a marinade in certain regional varieties.Richards 1966, p. 182. It is frequently advised to marinate the meat in an earthenware, glass, plastic, or enamel container rather than one made of bare metal, as the acidic marinade would react with a metal vessel during the extended marinating. Cooking the roast After the meat is removed from the marinade and dried, it is first browned in oil or lard and then braised with the strained marinade in a covered dish in a medium oven or on the stovetop. After simmering for four hours or more, depending on the size of the roast, the marinade will continue to flavor the roast and, as the meat cooks, its juices will also be released resulting in a very tender roast. Preparing the gravy After the roast is cooked, the marinade is strained and returned to a saucepan where it is thickened (often with crushed gingerbread, lebkuchen, or gingersnaps, flour, sour cream, brown sugar, and/or roux)Youngkrantz 1997, p. 105. which add body and flavor to the sauce. Before it closed in 1982, Luchow's German restaurant in New York City used crushed gingersnap cookies to season and thicken the gravy of its sauerbraten, one of the favored dishes.O'Neill 1992, p. 181. This style was made popular in the U.S. after the publication of Luchow's German Cookbook: The Story and the Favorite Dishes of America's Most Famous German Restaurant by Jan Mitchell in 1952.

Most are denominational schools, and the managers are often Catholic Church authorities, especially in the case of Catholic schools. Like national schools at primary level, voluntary secondary schools are supported by the Department of Education, on a per capita basis. Approximately 90% of teachers' salaries are met by the state. Some schools charge tuition fees, while many others request top-up funding or voluntary fee contributions from parents. The local community may also be involved in fund raising. Until 1966, all post- primary schools were voluntary secondary schools except for vocational schools run by Vocational Education Committees. The raising of the school leaving age by Donogh O'Malley triggered the creation of publicly managed community and comprehensive schools. Some smaller secondary schools subsequently merged with each other or with the public schools. Voluntary secondary schools still form the largest part of the post-primary school system and are attended by about 60% of post-primary education students. The schools are generally managed by a Board of Management or less often a patron or religious institute. A school principal is in general control of everyday business. Some voluntary secondary schools are boarding schools, this is particularly so in the case of Protestant, many of which are Church of Ireland, as students cannot commute daily to such schools which are often located only in a few provincial towns. These schools generally receive additional grants to the normal per capita grant.

It has a Mediterranean climate with 2570 hours a year of sunshine. Most summer days are hot, bright and clear with light westerly Maestral wind cooling the island in the afternoons. Silba has an area in the shape of number 8, with the village of Silba located at the narrowest point in the middle. It takes only around 10 minutes to walk the 600 m from the north-eastern harbour of Mul to the south-western harbour of ≈Ωaliƒá (Zhaleech). Officially, Silba's population is 292,http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/censustabsxls.htm but it varies seasonally; from a few hundred, mainly pensioners, in the winter, to several thousand during summer months. Many have jobs and properties on the mainland. There is also an influx of tourists during the summer months as tourism is now the main economic activity on the island. The whole island is a pedestrian zone, no traffic is allowed with the exception of vehicles supplying the local businesses. Zadar is Silba's mainland administrative center; it is part of the Zadar County. Geography The island has numerous small beaches and coves. The main public beach Sutori≈°ƒáe (Sotoreeshche), located close to the harbour of Mul, has very clear shallow waters with sandy bottom. On ≈Ωaliƒá, there are a number of pebbly beaches and a pier. Ships carrying passenger and commercial traffic dock here. There are a number of coves outside the village that can be reached by footpaths. On the southern side of the island, at walking distances of about 30‚Äì45 minutes, are: * Vele Stene (Large Rocks), the only point on the island where the shores are steep and rocky. * Port Sv. Ante, favoured with yachtsmen because it is protected from major winds. One can also view a small chapel on the side of the bay. * Dobre Vode, a beach with shallow sandy bottom. * Nozdre, a big cove with characteristic flat rock formations cut out by the sea. On the north side of the village is the highest point on Silba, Varh (86m). The northern shore is less accessible than the southern due to rocky shores, however, there is a path leading north out of the village to the small port of Papranica. Further on along the path, about an hours walk from the main village, is a cove Pernastica which is considered one of the nicest coves on the island. It faces westwards towards the sunset and has a long shallow sandy bottom. Toreta - iconic observation tower on the island of SilbaSilba's most popular landmark is Toreta, a sleek tower with a spiral staircase from which there is a wonderful view of the surrounding islands. It is in the centre of the village right on Veli Put - Silba's High Street. The village has several caf√©s, four restaurants, a number of shops, post office and a local GP. From any point in the village it takes only around 10 min or less to walk to the nearest beach. History The old name for this island is Selbo. It's supposed to come from the Latin word \\"Silva\\", meaning \\"forest\\". The island Silba is mentioned in historical records in the 9th century. In 827, it belonged to the Zadar county. In 1073, in the last year of Petar Kre≈°imir's reign, probably at the request of his sister Cika, the first nun of St. Maria in Zadar, the county donated the island to the monastery St. Maria, at the ceremony of sacrament of their church (some say this happened in 1027.). Later, the island fell into the hands of the Venetian authorities, which sold it to captain Fani Soppe for 12,350 ducats. It is not known how it later came into the ownership of Venetian family Morosini. Silba was held by family Morosini until the first quarter of 19th century. As it was too far to govern and receive tax on yield in nature they agreed with inhabitants of Silba in 1770 to receive each year 2000 Venetian lira in rent. Silbans called this rent ƒçetvrtina (quarter), as it amounted to quarter of the land's yields, which is what serfs elsewhere also gave to their masters. In 1838, for 28,500 Austrian lira, family Morosini sold the island to Marko Ragusin from Veli Lo≈°inj, who returned wealthy from United States. As Silbans paid rent to previous owner in currency, they assumed they will do the same to the new landowner, but since he lived in Lo≈°inj, near to Silba, he refused and demanded a quarter of land's yield in crop. A lawsuit ensued which lasted for 13 years when Ragusin finally decided to sell the island to these same inhabitants who bought it, each paying proportionally to the size of their plot, in total 5,025 bavarian thalers. On 19 March 1852 ownership of the island by inhabitants was registered. It became the island's main holiday, day of St. Joseph. In the 18th century Silba had a fleet 38 sailing boats with three masts called Manzere of 220 Mt and 60 sailing boats two masts called Kastrere of 63 Mt. The fleet was destroyed by the French at the beginning of the 19th century. The economic benefits to the island from sailing boats led to general well being on the island. Old local saying says: \\"Silba zlatom siva, i u njoj se raj u≈æiva\\", that is: \\"Silba shines with gold, on it heavenly enjoyment\\". In the olden days there was a custom of \\"village king\\" elections. The king would get elected on St. Stephen's Day (26 December) and his rule would last until Three Kings (6 January). During his twelve-day rule, he would preside, with crown on his head, surrounded by twelve councillors, over village gatherings and dealt justice. His task was to name the village head, head and members of village guards; close the previous years budget and plan the next years. He would give verdict on complaints and disputes that have accumulated during the year. This custom died out in the first quarter of the 19th century. The king's crown still exists in the treasury of the parish church.Juriƒá, Ljubimir. Silba (1910) (reprint 1991: Dru≈°tvo za za≈°titu prirode Silba) In 1943 Silba was the scene of a naval action during the Adriatic Campaign of World War II.

It stands in a park which formed a small part of the Digby estate. Old castle The ruins of the old castle Sherborne Old Castle () is the ruin of a 12th-century castle in the grounds of the mansion. The castle was built as the fortified palace of Roger de Caen, Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England, and still belonged to the church in the late 16th century. In the early 1140s, the castle was captured by Robert Earl of Gloucester during the Anarchy, when it was considered, 'the master-key of the whole kingdom'.King, Edmund. ‚ÄúThe Anarchy of King Stephen's Reign.‚Äù Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, vol. 34, 1984, pp. 133‚Äì153, 134. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3679129. Accessed 2 May 2020. After passing through Sherborne on the way to Plymouth, Sir Walter Raleigh fell in love with the castle, and Queen Elizabeth relinquished the estate, leasing it to Raleigh in 1592,Waymark 2001:65. Rather than refurbish the old castle, Raleigh decided to construct a new lodging for temporary visits, in the compact form for secondary habitations of the nobility and gentry, often architecturally sophisticated, that was known as a lodge. The new house, Sherborne Lodge, was a four-storey, rectangular building completed in 1594. The antiquary John Aubrey remembered it as \\"a delicate Lodge in the park, of Brick, not big, but very convenient for its bignes, a place to retire from the Court in summer time, and to contemplate, etc.\\"Aubrey, Brief Lives, \\"Sir Walter Raleigh, quoted by Nicholas Cooper, Houses of the Gentry 1480-1680, 1999:121. It had four polygonal corner turrets with angled masonry as if they were to serve for military defence, which Nicholas Cooper suggests \\"may be an obeisance to the old building\\".Nicholas Cooper 1999:121; the contemporary plan by Simon Basil, pl. 22, shows with dashed lines that the angle faces of the corner towers were aligned with the opposite inner corners. Its most progressive feature for its date was the entrance, disguised in one of the corner towers so as not to spoil the apparent symmetry of the facade, which was centred on a rectangular forecourt. The entrance vestibule also contained a winder stairwell and gave directly on the hall. During Raleigh's imprisonment in the Tower, King James leased the estate to Robert Carr and then sold it to Sir John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol in 1617. In the 1620s, the Digby family, in order to suit the lodge to a more permanent seat, added four wings to the house in an architectural style similar to the original, retaining the original corner towers. Civil War In the Civil War, Sherborne was strongly Royalist, with the castle now owned by Lord Digby, an advisor to the king. The castle was captured by Parliamentarians in September 1642, and recaptured in February 1643. In early August 1645, a New Model Army force under Sir Thomas Fairfax laid siege to the castle, then occupied by a Royalist garrison commanded by Sir Lewis Dyve. Following heavy bombardment and mining, Dyve surrendered the Castle on 17 August 1645. The castle was slighted in October 1645 and left in ruins. New castle Capability Brown's lake in Digby's garden The name \\"Sherborne Castle\\" was then applied to the new house, though today the term Sherborne New Castle is generally used to refer to it, in the same manner as \\"Sherborne Old Castle\\" is used for the ruins. Through the early and mid-18th century William, 5th Lord Digby,Though Lord Digby was sufficiently accomplished in architectural matters to rate an entry in Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects (3rd ed., 1995, s.v. \\"Digby, William, 5th Lord Digby\\") he left no mark at Sherborne. who laid out the grounds praised by Alexander Pope, and his heirs Edward, 6th Lord Digby, who inherited in 1752, and Henry, 7th Lord, created Earl Digby, laid out the present castle gardens. Features include the 1753 lake designed by Capability Brown, which separates the old and new castles.Waymark 2001. A new library, in Gothick taste, was carried out by the London surveyor William Ride in 1757-58, possibly to Ride's designs (Colvin 1995, s.v. \\"Ride, William\\"). The ruins of the old castle are part of the gardens, being conspicuous amongst the trees across the lake. King George III visited the house and gardens in 1789, shortly before awarding Henry Digby with a peerage. When Edward, 2nd and last Earl Digby, died in 1856 the house was passed to the Wingfield Digby family, who still own the house. The house was modernised by the architect Philip Charles Hardwick. In the First World War the house was used by the Red Cross as a hospital and in the Second World War as the headquarters for the commandos involved in the D-Day landings.  Listings  The newer house and the ruins of the old castle were designated as Grade I listed in 1951. Three outbuildings of the house, built in ashlar and stone, are Grade II* listed: the stables (1759, extended early 19th century); the greenhouse (c. 1779); and the dairy (late 18th century). The gardens are Grade I listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.  Today  The gardens are open to the public much of the year, and the house is open to the public most Saturdays. The estate often hosts special events, such as concerts and firework displays. The old castle was leased by English Heritage and is now separate from the rest of the estate.

It has released music from local artists such as Eskimo Joe, Ben Lee, The Avalanches, Wolfmother, Cut Copy, The Bumblebeez, Bag Raiders, Van She, Rocket Science, Ghostwood, The Presets, Pond, and Tame Impala, and local releases of international artists including Dom, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Chromeo, Colder, Klaxons, Ladyhawke, NYPC, MSTRKRFT, and Softlightes. After its establishment, the label was first recognised by the successful releases of The Living End's eponymous debut album and Ben Lee's Breathing Tornados, with the former becoming the highest-selling rock debut, and the latter being nominated for the ARIA Award for Album of the Year. It then grew during the early 2000s, defining itself through its assortment of parties, artists, and the \\"electronic, rock-leaning dance music\\" that became known as the \\"Modular sound\\". However, in 2015, a lawsuit filed by BMG Rights Management pitied the label against UMA, with UMA originally winning in July against owner Pavlovic, but the courts overturned the decision in October towards Pavlovic's favor. Thereafter, Pavlovic resigned in March 2016, leaving the label under renovations. History Modular Recordings was founded in 1998 by Steve Pavlovic, first recognized with The Living End's eponymous debut album and Ben Lee's Breathing Tornados. Both were successful, The Living End became the second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history at the time; Breathing Tornados was nominated for the \\"Album of the Year\\" ARIA Award. The Avalanches's Since I Left You (2000) was also another critical success, earning the group nine ARIA Award nominations. In 2004, with the emergence of Cut Copy, The Presets and The Bumblebeez and the development of regular Modular parties and tours, the label began to grow, defining its 'electronic, rock-leaning dance music' the \\"Modular sound\\". Dan Whitford of Cut Copy described it as 'discovering dance music played live with a more musical aesthetic, rather than just a DJ on stage'.\\"Cut Copy article 2011\\" Andrew Murfett, 'Cut Copy move on from the \\"Modular sound\\"' Sydney Morning Herald, 3 February 2011 In 2004, an office was established in New York, followed by London in 2005. Van She, a new wave electropop four piece from Sydney were signed in August 2005, as well as NYPC in mid-2006. An office in Los Angeles opened in 2007, along with the signing of Ghostwood, Plug-In City and The Whitest Boy Alive. In June 2015, Modular and Universal Music Australia were sued by BMG Rights Management for failing to honor an agreement made over $1 million worth in royalties from Tame Impala recordings, including Innerspeaker and Lonerism and the group's self-titled EP. Frontman Kevin Parker himself claimed in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) that 'Someone high up spent the money', and that he 'may never get that money'. UMA claimed that on 24 December 2014 Pavlovic agreed to sign a separation deal, giving half of Modular to UMA, together with music, trademarks, websites and other assets, but refused to and claimed the deal wasn't binding and is owed $32,500 in holiday pay. UMA initially won the lawsuit against Pavlovic in June at the New South Wales Court of Appeal, but the court overturned the decision in favor of Pavlovic in October, stating that Pavlovic did comply and recognized the deal, which was technically non-official since it wasn't signed. However, he resigned from Modular on 11 March and most of the roster of musicians have since been signed within Universal label group.

Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than , chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge. It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis, postpartum metritis, or postpartum endometritis. Risk factors include Caesarean section (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes, multiple vaginal exams, manual removal of the placenta, and prolonged labour among others. Most infections involve a number of types of bacteria. Diagnosis is rarely helped by culturing of the vagina or blood. In those who do not improve, medical imaging may be required. Other causes of fever following delivery include breast engorgement, urinary tract infections, infections of an abdominal incision or an episiotomy, and atelectasis. Due to the risks following Caesarean section, it is recommended that all women receive a preventive dose of antibiotics such as ampicillin around the time of surgery. Treatment of established infections is with antibiotics, with most people improving in two to three days. In those with mild disease, oral antibiotics may be used; otherwise intravenous antibiotics are recommended. Common antibiotics include a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin following vaginal delivery or clindamycin and gentamicin in those who have had a C-section. In those who are not improving with appropriate treatment, other complications such an abscess should be considered. In 2015, about 11.8 million maternal infections occurred. In the developed world about one to two percent develop uterine infections following vaginal delivery. This increases to five to thirteen percent among those who have more difficult deliveries and 50 percent with C-sections before the use of preventive antibiotics. In 2015, these infections resulted in 17,900 deaths down from 34,000 deaths in 1990. They are the cause of about 10% of deaths around the time of pregnancy. The first known descriptions of the condition date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates. These infections were a very common cause of death around the time of childbirth starting in at least the 18th century until the 1930s when antibiotics were introduced. In 1847, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiss decreased death from the disease in the First Obstetrical Clinic of Vienna from nearly twenty percent to two percent through the use of handwashing with calcium hypochlorite. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than , chills, low abdominal pain, and possibly bad smelling vaginal discharge. It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. Causes After childbirth a woman's genital tract has a large bare surface, which is prone to infection. Infection may be limited to the cavity and wall of her uterus, or it may spread beyond to cause septicaemia (blood poisoning) or other illnesses, especially when her resistance has been lowered by a long labour or severe bleeding. Puerperal infection is most common on the raw surface of the interior of the uterus after separation of the placenta (afterbirth); but pathogenic organisms may also affect lacerations of any part of the genital tract. By whatever portal, they can invade the bloodstream and lymph system to cause sepsis, cellulitis (inflammation of connective tissue), and pelvic or generalized peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining). The severity of the illness depends on the virulence of the infecting organism, the resistance of the invaded tissues, and the general health of the woman. Organisms commonly producing this infection are Streptococcus pyogenes; staphylococci (inhabitants of the skin and of pimples, carbuncles, and many other pustular eruptions); the anaerobic streptococci, which flourish in devitalized tissues such as may be present after long and injurious labour and unskilled instrumental delivery; Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens (inhabitants of the lower bowel); and Clostridium tetani. Risk factors Causes (listed in order of decreasing frequency) include endometritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia/atelectasis, wound infection, and septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Septic risk factors for each condition are listed in order of the postpartum day (PPD) on which the condition generally occurs. * PPD 0: atelectasis risk factors include general anesthesia, cigarette smoking, and obstructive lung disease. * PPD 1‚Äì2: urinary tract infections risk factors include multiple catheterization during labor, multiple vaginal examinations during labor, and untreated bacteriuria. * PPD 2‚Äì3: endometritis ( the most common cause ) risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examinations during labor. * PPD 4‚Äì5: wound infection risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examination during labor. * PPD 5‚Äì6: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and diffuse difficult vaginal childbirth. * PPD 7‚Äì21: mastitis risk factors include nipple trauma from breastfeeding.  Diagnosis  Puerperal fever is diagnosed when: * A temperature rise above maintained over 24 hours or recurring during the period from the end of the first to the end of the 10th day after childbirth or abortion. (ICD-10) * Oral temperature of or more on any two of the first ten days postpartum. (USJCMW)The Global Incidence of Puerperal Sepsis Protocol for a Systematic Review Puerperal fever (from the Latin puer, male child (boy)), is no longer favored as a diagnostic category. Instead, contemporary terminology specifies:Carter (2005):98 # the specific target of infection: endometritis (inflammation of the inner lining of the uterus), metrophlebitis (inflammation of the veins of the uterus), and peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining of the abdomen) # the severity of the infection: less serious infection (contained multiplication of microbes) or possibly life-threatening sepsis (uncontrolled and uncontained multiplication of microbes throughout the blood stream). Endometritis is a polymicrobial infection. It frequently includes organisms such as Ureaplasma, Streptococcus, Mycoplasma, and Bacteroides, and may also include organisms such as Gardnerella, Chlamydia, Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and Staphylococcus. Differential diagnosis A number of other conditions can cause fevers following delivery including: urinary tract infections, breast engorgement, atelectasis and surgical incisions, among others. Management Antibiotics have been used to prevent and treat these infections however the misuse of antibiotics is a serious problem for global health. It is recommended that guidelines be followed which outline when it is appropriate to give antibiotics and which antibiotics are most effective. Atelectasis: mild to moderate fever, no changes or mild rales on chest auscultation. Management: pulmonary exercises, ambulation (deep breathing and walking) Urinary tract infection : high fever, malaise, costovertebral tenderness, positive urine culture. Management: antibiotics as per culture sensitivity (cephalosporine). Endometritis: moderate fever, exquisite uterine tenderness, minimal abdominal findings. Management: multiple agent IV antibiotics to cover polymicrobial organisms: clindamycin, gentamicin, addition of ampicillin if no response, no cultures are necessary. Wound infection: persistent spiking fever despite antibiotics, wound erythema or fluctuance, wound drainage. Management: antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain wound, saline-soaked packing twice a day, secondary closure. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis: persistent wide fever swings despite antibiotics, usually normal abdominal or pelvic exams. Management: IV heparin for 7‚Äì10 days at rates sufficient to prolong the PTT to double the baseline values. Mastitis: unilateral, localized erythema, edema, tenderness. Management: antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain abscess if present. Epidemiology The number of cases of puerperal sepsis per year shows wide variations among published literature‚Äîthis may be related to different definition, recording etc. Globally, bacterial infections are the cause of 10% of maternal deaths‚Äîthis is more common in low income countries but is also a direct cause of maternal deaths in high income countries. In the United States, puerperal infections are believed to occur in between one and eight percent of all births. About three die from puerperal sepsis for every 100,000 births. The single most important risk factor is Caesarean section. The number of maternal deaths in the United States is about 13 in 100,000. They make up about 11% of pregnancy related deaths in the United States. In the United Kingdom 1985-2005, the number of direct deaths associated with genital tract sepsis per 100,000 pregnancies was 0.40‚Äì0.85. In 2003‚Äì2005, genital tract sepsis accounted for 14% of direct causes of maternal death.CEMACH: Saving Mothers' Lives 2003‚Äì2005 Puerperal infections in the 18th and 19th centuries affected, on average, 6 to 9 women in every 1,000 births, killing two to three of them with peritonitis or sepsis. It was the single most common cause of maternal mortality, accounting for about half of all deaths related to childbirth, and was second only to tuberculosis in killing women of childbearing age. A rough estimate is that about 250,000‚Äì500,000 died from puerperal fever in the 18th and 19th centuries in England and Wales alone.  History  Although it had been recognized from as early as the time of the Hippocratic corpus that women in childbed were prone to fevers, the distinct name, \\"puerperal fever\\" appears in historical records only from the early 18th century.The debate about when this term first emerged is presented by Irvine Loudon, The tragedy of childbed fever, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 8. The death rate for women giving birth decreased in the 20th century in developed countries. The decline may be partly attributed to improved environmental conditions, better obstetrical care, and the use of antibiotics. Another reason appears to be a lessening of the virulence or invasiveness of Streptococcus pyogenes. This organism is also the cause of scarlet fever, which over the same period has also declined markedly in severity and incidence. \\"The Doctor's Plague\\" In his 1861 book, Ignaz Semmelweis presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of pathological anatomy in Vienna in 1823 (vertical line) was correlated to the incidence of fatal childbed fever there. Onset of chlorine handwash in 1847 marked by vertical line. Rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy, is shown for comparison (view rates). His efforts were futile, however. From the 1600s through the mid-to-late 1800s, the majority of childbed fever cases were caused by the doctors themselves. With no knowledge of germs, doctors did not believe hand washing was needed. Hospitals for childbirth became common in the 17th century in many European cities. These \\"lying-in\\" hospitals were established at a time when there was no knowledge of antisepsis or epidemiology, and women were subjected to crowding, frequent vaginal examinations, and the use of contaminated instruments, dressings, and bedding. It was common for a doctor to deliver one baby after another, without washing his hands or changing clothes between patients. The first recorded epidemic of puerperal fever occurred at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris in 1646. Hospitals throughout Europe and America consistently reported death rates between 20% to 25% of all women giving birth, punctuated by intermittent epidemics with up to 100% fatalities of women giving birth in childbirth wards.Loudon I. \\"Deaths in childbed from the eighteenth century to 1935\\". Med History 1986; 30: 1‚Äì41 In the 1800s Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth in the doctor's maternity ward. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an antiseptic, in this case a calcium chloride solution, before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%. Publication of his findings was not well received by the medical profession. The idea conflicted both with the existing medical concepts and with the image doctors had of themselves. The scorn and ridicule of doctors was so extreme that Semmelweis moved from Vienna and was eventually committed to a mental asylum where he died. Semmelweis was not the only doctor ignored after sounding a warning about this issue: in Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever (1795), ex- naval surgeon and Aberdonian obstetrician Alexander Gordon (1752‚Äì1799) warned that the disease was transmitted from one case to another by midwives and doctors. Gordon wrote, \\"It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention, that I myself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women.\\" On p. 63, Gordon recognized the puerperal fever as infectious: \\"But this disease seized such women only, as were visited, or delivered, by a practitioner, or taken care of by a nurse, who had previously attended patients affected with the disease. In short, I had evident proofs of its infectious nature, and that the infection was as readily communicated as that of the smallpox, or measles, and operated more speedily than any other infection, with which I am acquainted.\\" From p. 64: \\"It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention, that I myself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women.\\" Thomas Watson (1792‚Äì1882), Professor of Medicine at King's College Hospital, London, wrote in 1842: \\"Wherever puerperal fever is rife, or when a practitioner has attended any one instance of it, he should use most diligent ablution.\\" Watson recommended handwashing with chlorine solution and changes of clothing for obstetric attendants \\"to prevent the practitioner becoming a vehicle of contagion and death between one patient and another.\\" From p. 806: \\"Whenever puerperal fever is rife, or when a practitioner has attended any one example of it, he should use most diligent ablution; he should even wash his hands with some disinfecting fluid, a weak solution of chlorine for instance: he should avoid going in the same dress to any other of his midwifery patients: in short, he should take all those precautions which, when the danger is understood, common sense will suggest, against his clothes or his body becoming a vehicle of contagion and death between one patient and another.\\"The Medical Journal of Australia.\\"The contagiousness of childbed fever: a short history of puerperal sepsis and its treatment\\" Hygienic measures Ignaz Semmelweis, discoverer of some of the causes of puerperal fever In 1843, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. published The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever and controversially concluded that puerperal fever was frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses; he suggested that clean clothing and avoidance of autopsies by those aiding birth would prevent the spread of puerperal fever.Oliver Wendell Holmes: The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever Holmes quoted Dr. James Blundell as stating, \\"... in my own family, I had rather that those I esteemed the most should be delivered unaided, in a stable, by the mangerside, than that they should receive the best help, in the fairest apartment, but exposed to the vapors of this pitiless disease.\\"(Holmes, 1842‚Äì1843), p. 510. Holmes' conclusions were ridiculed by many contemporaries, including Charles Delucena Meigs, a well-known obstetrician, who stated, \\"Doctors are gentlemen, and gentlemen's hands are clean.\\" From p. 104: Speaking of a physician in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Meigs said: \\"He is a gentlemen who is scrupulously careful of his personal appearance, ‚Ä¶ But a gentleman's hands are clean.\\" Richard Gordon states that Holmes' exhortations \\"outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia\\". In those days, \\"surgeons operated in blood- stiffened frock coats‚Äîthe stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon\\", \\"pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood\\", and \\"Cleanliness was next to prudishness\\". He quotes Sir Frederick Treves on that era: \\"There was no object in being clean. Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head\\".Gordon, Richard (1983) p. 44 In 1844, Ignaz Semmelweis was appointed assistant lecturer in the First Obstetric Division of the Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus), where medical students received their training. Working without knowledge of Holmes' essay, Semmelweis noticed his ward's 16% mortality rate from fever was substantially higher than the 2% mortality rate in the Second Division, where midwifery students were trained. Semmelweis also noticed that puerperal fever was rare in women who gave birth before arriving at the hospital. Semmelweis noted that doctors in First Division performed autopsies each morning on women who had died the previous day, but the midwives were not required or allowed to perform such autopsies. He made the connection between the autopsies and puerperal fever after a colleague, Jakob Kolletschka, died of sepsis after accidentally cutting his hand while performing an autopsy. Semmelweis began experimenting with various cleansing agents and, from May 1847, ordered all doctors and students working in the First Division wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before starting ward work, and later before each vaginal examination. The mortality rate from puerperal fever in the division fell from 18% in May 1847 to less than 3% in June‚ÄìNovember of the same year. While his results were extraordinary, he was treated with skepticism and ridicule (see Response to Semmelweis). He did the same work in St. Rochus hospital in Pest, Hungary, and published his findings in 1860, but his discovery was again ignored.Christa Colyer.\\"Childbed fever: a nineteenth-century mystery,\\" National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science, December 8, 1999 (revised October 27, 2003). In 1935, Leonard Colebrook showed Prontosil was effective against haemolytic streptococcus and hence a cure for puerperal fever.Colebrook, L; Kenny, M (June 6, 1936). \\"Treatment of Human Puerperal Infections, and of Experimental Infections in Mice, with Prontosil\\".Lancet 227(1): 1279‚Äì1286. Notable cases Elite status was no protection against postpartum infections, as the deaths of several English queens attest. Elizabeth of York, queen consort of Henry VII, died of puerperal fever one week after giving birth to a daughter, who also died. Her son Henry VIII had two wives who died this way, Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr. Suzanne Barnard, mother of philosopher Jean- Jacques Rousseau, contracted childbed fever after giving birth to him, and died nine days later. Her infant son was also in perilous health following the birth; the adult Rousseau later wrote that \\"I came into the world with so few signs of life that little hope was entertained of preserving me\\". He was nursed back to health by an aunt.Quoted from Will Durant's \\"The Age of Rousseau\\". French natural philosopher √âmilie du Ch√¢telet died in 1749. Mary Wollstonecraft, author of Vindication of the Rights of Woman, died ten days after giving birth to her second daughter, who grew up to write Frankenstein. Other notable victims include African-American poet Phillis Wheatley (1784), British housekeeping authority Isabella Beeton, and American author Jean Webster in 1916 died of puerperal fever. In Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol, it is implied that both Scrooge's mother and younger sister perished from this condition, explaining the character's animosity towards his nephew Fred and also his poor relationship with his own father.

It has both a national organization and chapters in individual states. Although frequently confused, the YRNF is independent from the College Republicans. Young Republican Clubs are both social and political in nature. Many of them sponsor various social events and networking events for members. In addition, Young Republican Clubs assist Republican political candidates and causes.  History  Although Young Republican organizations existed as early as 1856 with the founding of The New York Young Republican Clubhttps://nyyrc.com/history/, the Young Republican National Federation was formed by George H. Olmsted at the urging of Herbert Hoover. The YRNF was officially founded in 1931.  Organizational structure  The YRNF has limited control over its state federations. A few states, including Montana and the District of Columbia, act as both a state and local chapter, while a majority of states, including Texas and California, grant strong autonomy to individual clubs. Some federations include a regional chair to handle issues of clubs in the same city or plan larger events in a particular part of the state. State Federations elect a chair, treasurer, secretary, national committee man and national committee woman. Depending on the state, vice-chair, immediate past chair, or other directors are also elected to form the executive committee. Voting rights at state meetings are giving to each member of the executive committee, as well as regional chairs and club presidents. The state chair, national committee man, and national committee woman serve on the national governing board and elect a national chair, co-chair, treasurer, secretary, assistants, and others. Most clubs are allowed to form after having a small group of active members, those who pay club dues and are under 41 years of age, and by having the club pay a fee to its state governing body on an annual basis. Presently, the National Federation does not collect dues from either its state federations or its club members, raising money only through attendance at national events and from private donations.

It is one of the 13 designated neighbourhoods of Crawley and a local government ward. Furnace Green is located to the east of the town centre. It is bordered by Tilgate to the south west, Three Bridges to the north and Maidenbower to the east (on the other side of the London-Brighton railway line). The name Furnace Green is a reference to the iron smelting which is reputed to have taken place in Roman times - the local public house is the Charcoal Burner. Like much of Crawley, the street naming is themed i.e. different areas are linked by associated names. There are racecourses - Newmarket, Fontwell etc., forests - Arden, Savernake, Epping etc., references to the Norfolk Broads - Waveney, Oulton, Norwich, Yarmouth etc. There are also references to the iron industry - Coltash Road, Weald Drive, and the name Feroners Close also recalls the iron smelting. Crawley New Town With the creation of Crawley New Town in 1947 the Tilgate East area was reserved for housing. It was proposed to use this area for around 1000 houses because of the expansion of Crawley. The area was renamed Furnace Green after a farm in the area. Work started in 1960 and carried on into the 1980s. Furnace Green had a population of 6737 in 1981. Features There is a Nature Reserve and flood plain named Waterlea Meadow lying between Norwich Road and Waterlea. It is split by a meandering stream and has several ponds and footpaths. The stream is largely fed from the lake at Tilgate Park and in times of heavy rain often overflows onto the paths. National Cycle Route 20 passes through Furnace Green, entering via Tilgate Drive from Three Bridges, to the north, at the point where it passes over the Horsham railway line and continuing south into Tilgate Forest en route for Brighton. Part of it also forms a section of the Avenue Verte (Greenway) long distance cycling route from London to Paris which branches off towards East Grinstead via the Worth Way as part of NCR 21. Crawley's only full scale theatre is located on the northern edge of Furnace Green. The Hawth takes its name from the large area of woodland to its rear. Health GP surgery in Furnace Green. Primary Care in Furnace Green is served by the GP practice in The Glade.

Early life Spence was born on the island of Eday in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, the son of a stonemason, and migrated to Australia with his family as a six-year-old child. He had no formal education and worked as a farm labourer in the Wimmera district of Victoria from the age of 13. Later he acquired a gold-mining licence and worked for various mining companies. In 1871 he married Ann Jane Savage. In 1874 Spence was one of a number of militant mine-workers who formed the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Victoria, and he became the union's general secretary in 1882. He led the union into mergers with similar unions in the other Australian colonies, forming the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia. In 1886, he became the first president of the Australian Shearers' Union; he also became president of its successor, the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia in 1887, and by 1890 most shearers in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales had joined the union and 85 per cent of the shearing sheds were open to union members only. Since the Australian economy was expanding rapidly at this time and there was an acute shortage of labour, the unions were in a strong bargaining position and were able to secure great improvements in the living standards of Australia's rural working class. But the Depression which began in 1891 led to acute class conflict as the mine owners and graziers tried to cut wages to remain solvent in the face of falling commodity prices, and the unions resisted. In 1894 Spence led the amalgamation of the miners, shearers and other rural workers into the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), Australia's largest and most powerful union. There were bitter strikes in the maritime and pastoral industries, in which Spence played a leading role, although he was generally a force for moderation in the labour movement. He was the AWU's secretary from 1894 to 1898 and president from 1898 to 1917. Political career 1901 election, including Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, Billy Hughes, Frank Tudor, and King O'Malley. Spence is seated in a chair at far left. The defeat of the strikes of 1891‚Äì1894 led Spence and other labour leaders to move into politics. Spence supported the formation of the Progressive Political League, an early labour party, in Victoria in 1891 and he was narrowly beaten at a by-election in 1892 for the seat of Dundas in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. In 1891, he supported the first election campaign by the Labour Party in New South Wales, which won a number of seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. In 1898 Spence he became MP for Cobar in western New South Wales. He remained president of the AWU, making him one of the most powerful men in New South Wales politics. He described himself as \\"an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, socialist.\\" Unlike many in the labour movement, Spence supported the federation of the Australian colonies, and in 1901 he was elected to the first Australian House of Representatives as MP for the NSW Division of Darling. Like most of the older generation of labour leaders who were born in the United Kingdom, Spence was associated with the more conservative wing of the Australian Labor Party, led by Billy Hughes. He was not really suited to parliamentary life and did not hold office until he was appointed Postmaster-General in the third Fisher Ministry from September 1914 to October 1915. He was also appointed to the undemanding position of Vice-President of the Executive Council in the second Hughes Ministry from November 1916 to February 1917. In 1916 Hughes decided to introduce conscription to maintain Australia's contribution to the Allied forces in World War I. Most of the Labor Party bitterly opposed this, but Spence sided with Hughes. As a result, he was expelled from the party along with Hughes and the other conscriptionist MPs. He was also deposed as president of the AWU and shortly after was expelled from the union. At the 1917 federal election, although Hughes was easily returned to power, Spence lost his seat, mainly because the AWU organised the rural workers to oppose him. Shortly after he was returned to Parliament at a by-election for the Tasmanian seat of Darwin. He was one of only a small number of people who have represented more than one state or territory in the Parliament. In 1919, he ran for the Melbourne seat of Batman, but was defeated. Spence took up farming and died of pulmonary oedema at Terang, Victoria, survived by his wife, four daughters and three of his five sons. His daughter Gwynetha had married publisher and politician Hector Lamond in 1902. Honours In 1972 the Canberra suburb of Spence was named after William Guthrie Spence. In October 2003 the Australian Workers' Union named its Melbourne headquarters in Spence's honour.

He was known mainly for his considerable output of art songs and song cycles, though he also wrote a number of operas, notably his one-act Penthesilea, which was premiered at the Semperoper in Dresden in 1927 and revived at the Lucerne Festival in 1999. He wrote a handful of instrumental compositions, including two string quartets and concertos for violin (for Stefi Geyer, dedicatee also of B√©la Bart√≥k's first concerto), cello and horn. Biography Early life and career Schoeck was born in Brunnen, studied briefly at the Leipzig Conservatory with Max Reger in 1907/08, but otherwise spent his whole career in Z√ºrich. His father, Alfred Schoeck was a landscape painter, and as a young man, Othmar seriously considered following in his father's footsteps and attended classes an art school in Z√ºrich before dropping out to go to the Z√ºrich Conservatory. During World War I Schoeck earned his living in Zurich initially as a chorus director and as a freelance accompanist and conductor. An annuity given him by the Winterthur industrialist Werner Reinhart from 1916 onwards, coupled with the income from his appointment as conductor of the St Gall Symphony orchestra in 1917 (with special permission to remain resident in Z√ºrich), allowed Schoeck to give up choral conducting and devote more time to composition instead.The Schoeck Home Page. - Chris Walton: Othmar Schoeck. Life and Works. University of Rochester Press, Rochester NY 2009; xvii, 444 p., ill. (Eastman Studies in Music); , p. 71-74. Influence of Busoni In 1916, Schoeck became acquainted with Ferruccio Busoni, who had moved to Zurich from Berlin to escape the adverse effects of the war. Busoni was not alone in coming to Zurich. The war had turned \\"provincial\\" Zurich, in neutral Switzerland, into an international metropolis. Schoeck was a great admirer of the songs of Hugo Wolf; Busoni disliked them, and he said so. Despite their differences, their relationship quickly developed into one of mutual respect, and even one with a bit of affection. In fact, it was Busoni's suggestion that Schoeck use Ludvig Holberg's Don Ranudo de Colibrados as the subject of an opera.Walton, pp. 3‚Äì4. On 19 June 1917 Philipp Jarnach, a French composer who was also a refugee in Zurich, and an assistant of Busoni, gave Busoni a copy of Martin Buber's book Chinesische Geister- und Liebesgeschichten [Chinese Ghost and Love Stories] (Frankfurt, 1911). Jarnach suggested that one of these short stories might be suitable for an opera. Busoni immediately wrote a libretto, Das Wandbild [The Picture on the Wall], a short scene and pantomime, which he finished eight days later. Jarnach composed a prelude and the first scene, but lost interest and dropped the project.Beaumont, p. 262n. Undaunted, in June 1918 Busoni offered it to Schoeck. Schoeck, who appears to have taken the offer as a sort of challenge, immediately set aside the orchestration of Don Ranudo, and in three days, produced the new opera.Walton, p. 4. Das Wandbild is set in a Parisian antique shop around 1830. A student, Novalis, is captivated by a picture of a girl hanging on a wall of the shop. The picture comes to life, and in typical Busoni fashion, the scene immediately dissolves into a fantastical Chinese temple. The opera ends with Novalis awaking from his dream-state and escaping from the shop into the reality of the street. It is one of Schoeck's most unusual creations, \\"almost minimalist in conception.\\" Stylistic shift Around 1918 Schoeck's music began a stylistic shift. At this time he became involved with the pianist Mary de Senger, who appears to have had a profound influence on his compositional style. The second act of his next opera, Venus (1919‚Äì1921), employs interesting polyrhythmic and bitonal effects. As he became acquainted with the work of Alban Berg and Les six in Paris, he began to feel isolated by his stylistic conservatism.Walton, Chris. \\"Schoeck, Othmar,\\" New Grove, 2nd edition. By 1922 his former mentor, Busoni, who was now back in Berlin, wrote a letter to Volkmar Andreae, saying: \\"Schoeck has completely abandoned me. I have not entirely given him up. He lacks (or lacked) certain ingredients, which are not available at the chemists'. Which should however be manufactured in his own laboratory.\\"Letter (original in German) to Volkmar Andreae, dated 28 May 1922. Beaumont, p. 353. In the summer of 1923 Schoeck visited Arthur Honegger in Paris, and he later participated in the Salzburg ISCM festival. Not long afterwards, his affair with de Senger came to an end. His distress over the breakup, combined with the shock of the new music he had heard in Paris and Salzburg, seems to have led to a new maturity in his compositional style. Two weeks after his affair ended, he composed the song Die Entschwundene (1923), which was \\"as much a farewell to the tonal world of his previous music as to his departed lover.\\" Schoeck was not given to overt signs of gratitude, but he dedicated the song cycle Gaselen (1923),Musinfo the Sonata for Bass Clarinet and Piano (1927‚Äì28), and the Suite in A flat for Strings (1945) to Werner Reinhart .Theodore Front Musical Literature. tfront.com His work with the German poet Hermann Burte on the opera Das Schloss D√ºrande, for production at the Berlin State Opera, caused great controversy for Schoeck with the Swiss, because of his association with artists of Nazi Germany. The opera was premiered in Berlin on 1 April 1943 in the presence of Schoeck. Schoeck himself did not harbor Nazi sympathies, but the angry Swiss reaction to Schoeck's actions damaged his reputation and put great strain on Schoeck. He suffered a heart attack in March 1944, but continued to compose.

In representing three different political parties in parliament‚ÄîNew Zealand First, Mauri Pacific and the National Party‚ÄîHenare served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1993 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2014. Early life Henare was born in Otara, New Zealand, the son of a 37-year railwayman, on 29 September 1960. Known by his middle name \\"Tau,\\" Henare's tribal roots are NgƒÅpuhi and what he characterises as \\"all the North\\". His involvement in politics can be traced to his family's involvement in politics. Henare's great-grandfather, Taurekareka (Tau) Henare, served in Parliament from 1914 to 1938 alongside notable MƒÅori politicians such as ƒÄpirana Ngata, James Carroll and Maui Pomare. Henare's great-uncle was MƒÅori Battalion leader and politician Sir James Henare, who was once considered a candidate to be Governor-General and served as a revered guide and mentor to a young Tau. Henare himself was the brother-in-law to New Zealand MƒÅori politician Tuku Morgan through Henare's marriage to the sister of Morgan's wife. As a young boy growing up in Otara, Henare had a contrasting childhood. On one hand, he was told almost before he could walk that his future would be politics, which at times requires statesman-like skills to deal with others. On the other, Otara was \\"a place where you learn how to survive,\\" and it required Henare to learn \\"to be strong, stand up and not take a backward step.\\" Looking back on his 1960s childhood in 1996, Henare summed it up as one that \\"taught me to be proud of who I am.\\" It also later contributed to what he describes as \\"youthful exuberance\\" that lead to a 1980s reputation for being a stirrer and a radical. In Otara, Henare attended Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate. During Year 11 (Form 5) when he was 16, Henare passed School Certificate, a former New Zealand secondary school qualification for high school students to progress to Year 12. However, Henare was unsuccessful on his New Zealand University Entrance. After his schooling ended in 1978, Henare worked at a variety of positions, including wool cleaner and wool classer, where he was responsible for separating sheep's wool, organiser for the Northern Clerical Workers' Union under activist and trade unionist Syd Jackson, community worker, advise to the Waitakere City Council, and Department of Internal Affairs adviser. During this period, Henare was unemployed for two years. Also, at the age of 25, Henare was arrested for breaking through a police line and laying a wreath for the Maori Battalion during a royal visit on Anzac Day in 1985. In addition to being influenced by his upbringing and pre-Member of Parliament work, Henare was influenced during his 20s by MƒÅori culture: In connection with Winston Peters (himself half MƒÅori) establishing the New Zealand First party in July 1993, Henare changed the focus of his activities to politics for the 6 November 1993 election. Member of Parliament Henare first won election to Parliament in the 1993 election as the New Zealand First candidate for the Northern Maori electorate, a surprising result given Labour's traditional dominance in the MƒÅori electorates. In defeating incumbent Labour Party member Bruce Gregory, Henare became New Zealand First's third MP, joining Peters in the House. As such, Henare became New Zealand First's deputy leader. His election helped counter the perception that New Zealand First was merely an extension of Peters. In December 1994, Northern Maori member of parliament Henare supported MƒÅori tribe's paramount chief Sir Hepi Te Heuheu in Heuheu's refusal to attend a meeting with then Prime Minister Jim Bolger for a roundtable discussion on government proposals to settle MƒÅori claims, reasoning that the government's handling of Maori claims indicated a lack of understanding of the gravity of the issues involved and the meeting would be a public relations exercise. Two months later in February 1995, Henare supported a push to have the United Nations oversee a fiscal envelope negotiation process. by which a monetary cap of $1 billion would be placed in a \\"fiscal envelope\\" for use in settling all Treaty of Waitangi grievances. Henare felt that United Nations scrutiny would ensure justice in the face of past treaty breaches and that the Government's forceful approach did not create future resentment. Minister of MƒÅori Affairs In the 1996 election, conducted under the new MMP electoral system, New Zealand First gained fifteen further MPs, and also made a clean sweep of the five MƒÅori electorates. As deputy leader, Henare was second on New Zealand First's party list behind Peters. He easily won re-election in his electorate, which had been renamed Te Tai Tokerau. When New Zealand First went into coalition with National, allowing a third term of the fourth National government, Henare joined the Cabinet, with his most prominent ministry that of MƒÅori Affairs. He and the four other New Zealand First MƒÅori MPs ‚Äî Tuku Morgan, Rana Waitai, Tu Wyllie and Tuariki Delamere ‚Äî became known as the Tight Five, an allusion to the five tight forwards in a rugby union team. Mauri Pacific National and New Zealand First initially worked very well together, but relations became more strained after Jenny Shipley ousted Jim Bolger as National leader and Prime Minister in 1997. In August 1998, the coalition started to become unstable, and internal tensions arose within New Zealand First itself. When Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet on 14 August 1998, Peters pulled New Zealand First out of the coalition. However, Henare and several other New Zealand First MPs left the party to sit as independents. They offered their support to National, allowing the government to maintain a slim majority. It later emerged that before departing, Henare had mounted an unsuccessful challenge to Peters. Later in 1998, he banded together with four other MPs who had departed New Zealand First (including two other members of the Tight Five, Morgan and Waitai), to form a new party, Mauri Pacific, with himself as the new party's leader. Late in the term, he was criticised for refusing to give Trevor Mallard a chance to speak on the use of the MƒÅori language in Parliament because Mallard wasn't MƒÅori. In the 1999 election, Henare finished a distant third in his electorate and Mauri Pacific only gained 0.08% of the vote, forcing Mauri Pacific out of Parliament. National Party In the 2002 election, after Mauri Pacific's dissolution, Henare stood as a candidate for the National Party. He contested the Te Atat≈´ electorate, and was ranked thirty-fifth on National's list. On election day, Henare finished second in Te Atat≈´, and National did not win enough votes for Henare to return to Parliament as a list MP. In the , Henare stood again as a National candidate, again contesting Te Atat≈´ and holding the 29th slot on the party list. He expressed agreement with the controversial Orewa speech on race relations made by National Party leader Don Brash. Henare almost doubled his vote from the result but still finished a distant second in Te Atat≈´. However, National's gains in the election were enough to return him to Parliament as a list MP. With the National Party in opposition, Henare was a member of the MƒÅori Affairs select committee, an associate spokesperson for Treaty of Waitangi negotiations and early childhood education under Brash, and a spokesperson for MƒÅori affairs under John Key. In October 2007, Henare had an altercation with Labour Party MP Trevor Mallard outside the debating chamber in Parliament House; Mallard was later convicted of fighting in a public place. In , Henare contested Te Atat≈´; again, he finished second and was returned as a list MP. The National Party formed a government but Henare was not appointed as a Minister; instead, he was named chairperson of the MƒÅori affairs select committee. In 2009, Henare was additionally appointed deputy chairperson of the select committee considering legislative changes following the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance. In August 2009, it emerged that Henare had sent an email to his colleagues lobbying for the right to vote against part of the Auckland governance legislation, in particular the part that denied separate MƒÅori seats on the new Auckland Council which had been promoted by the ACT Party. In response to reaction to the email, Henare made a number of challenging remarks about MƒÅori Party co-leader Pita Sharples. Ultimately, no separate MƒÅori seats were established. In February 2010, Henare's Employment Relations (Workers' Secret Ballot for Strikes) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. The bill was enacted in May 2012. In , Henare contested Te Atat≈´ to come in second and be returned as a list MP. He was reappointed to the chair of the MƒÅori affairs committee. In March 2012, Henare married Ngaire Brown, his long-term partner, in a Parliament select committee room. The wedding celebrant was fellow MP Chris Auchinvole, Paula Bennett spoke, and Parekura Horomia gave the mihi (formal speech). In addition to his public office, Henare held positions as a talkback host on Newstalk ZB, an early childhood education consultant, a trustee on the Kura Kaupapa board and the Rutherford College board, and chairman of Tu Tangata education provider. In late 2012 Henare was looking to succeed Lockwood Smith as Speaker, but dropped his bid when he lost the backing of the MƒÅori Party.

It is to be contrasted with the law of compensation, which is the law of loss-based recovery. When a court orders restitution it orders the defendant to give up his/her gains to the claimant. When a court orders compensation it orders the defendant to pay the claimant for his or her loss. American Jurisprudence 2d edition notes: Restitution may be either a legal remedy or an equitable remedy, \\"depend[ing] upon the basis for the plaintiff's claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought\\". Generally, restitution and Equitable tracing is an equitable remedy when the money or property wrongfully in the possession of defendant is traceable (i.e., can be tied to \\"particular funds or property\\"). In such a case, restitution comes in the form of a constructive trust or equitable lien. Where the particular property at issue cannot be particularly identified, restitution is a legal remedy. This occurs, for example, when the plaintiff \\"seeks a judgment imposing personal liability to pay a sum of money\\". Unjust enrichment and quantum meruit are sometimes identified as types of a disgorgement legal remedies. This type of damages restores the benefit conferred to the non-breaching party. Put simply, the plaintiff will get the value of whatever was conferred to the defendant when there was a contract. There are two general limits to recovery, which is that a complete breach of contract is needed, and the damages will be capped at the contract price if the restitution damages exceed it. The orthodox view suggests that there is only one principle on which the law of restitution is dependent, namely the principle of unjust enrichment. However, the view that restitution, like other legal responses, can be triggered by any one of a variety of causative events is increasingly prevalent. These are events in the real world which trigger a legal response. It is beyond doubt that unjust enrichment and wrongs can trigger an obligation to make restitution. Certain commentators propose that there is a third basis for restitution, namely the vindication of property rights with which the defendant has interfered. It is arguable that other types of causative event can also trigger an obligation to make restitution.  For wrongs  Imagine that A commits a wrong against B and B sues in respect of that wrong. A will certainly be liable to pay compensation to B. If B seeks compensation then the court award will be measured by reference to the loss that B has suffered as a result of A's wrongful act. However, in certain circumstances it will be open to B to seek restitution rather than compensation. It will be in his interest to do so if the profit that A made by his wrongful act is greater than the loss suffered by B. Whether or not a claimant can seek restitution for a wrong depends to a large extent on the particular wrong in question. For example, in English law, restitution for breach of fiduciary duty is widely available but restitution for breach of contract is fairly exceptional. The wrong could be of any one of the following types: #A statutory tort #A common law tort #An equitable wrong Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio [1983] HCA 14; (1983) 151 CLR 447. #A breach of contract #Criminal offences Notice that (1)-(5) are all causative events (see above). The law responds to each of them by imposing an obligation to pay compensatory damages. Restitution for wrongs is the subject which deals with the issue of when exactly the law also responds by imposing an obligation to make restitution. Example In Attorney General v Blake, an English court found itself faced with the following claim. The defendant had made a profit somewhere in the region of ¬£60,000 as a direct result of breaching his contract with the claimant. The claimant was undoubtedly entitled to claim compensatory damages but had suffered little or no identifiable loss. It therefore decided to seek restitution for the wrong of breach of contract. The claimant won the case and the defendant was ordered to pay over his profits to the claimant. However, the court was careful to point out that the normal legal response to a breach of contract is to award compensation. An order to make restitution was said to be available only in exceptional circumstances. To reverse unjust enrichment Cases of intentional torts or breaches of fiduciary duty often allow for claims of unjust enrichment, as well as cases of statutory torts and breaches of contract. A plaintiff can even have a claim in unjust enrichment when there is no other substantive claim. The Uniform Commercial Code (\\"UCC\\") entitles a buyer who defaults restitution of the buyer's deposit to the extent it exceeds reasonable liquidated damages or actual damages. If the contract does not have a liquidated damages clause, the UCC provides a statutory sum: 20% of the price or $500, whichever is less, and the buyer who defaulted is entitled to restitution of any excess.

Biography From Howden's name and the internal evidence of his work, he is believed to have been a native of Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Nothing is known of him before the year 1174. He was then in attendance upon Henry II, by whom he was sent from France on a secret mission to the lords of Galloway. In 1175 he again appears as a negotiator between the king and a number of English religious houses. The interest which Howden shows in ecclesiastical affairs and miracles may justify the supposition that he was a clerk in orders. This, however, did not prevent him from acting, in 1189, as a justice of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, Cumberland and Northumberland. During this time, Howden is believed to have been working on his Gesta Henrici II et Gesta Regis Ricardi. This chronicle was formerly ascribed to Benedict of Peterborough, who had the manuscript copied for his library. The Gesta Regis Henrici II & Gesta Regis Ricardi is the work of a well-informed man, connected with the court and inclined to take the side of Henry II. He confines himself to the external history of events, and his tone is strictly impersonal. He incorporates some official documents, and in many places obviously derives his information from others which he does not quote. There is a break in his work at the year 1177, where the earliest manuscript ends. The work begins at Christmas 1169, and concludes in 1192; it is thus in form a fragment, covering portions of the reign of Henry II and Richard I. Howden went on the Third Crusade with Richard I of England, joining him in Marseille in August 1190. He left for Europe in August 1191, in the entourage of Philip II of France. On his return, about the year 1192 he began to compile his Chronica, a general history of England from 732 to his own time. Up to the year 1192 his narrative adds little to our knowledge. For the period 732‚Äì1148 he chiefly drew upon an extant, but unpublished chronicle, the Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obitum Bedae (British Library Royal MS 13 A VIBritish Library Archives and Manuscripts catalogue: Royal MS 13 A VI.), which was composed about 1150. From 1148 to 1170 he used the Melrose Chronicle (edited for the Bannatyne Club in 1835 by Joseph Stevenson) and a collection of letters bearing upon the Thomas Becket controversy. From 1170 to 1192 he drew upon his own earlier Gesta Regis Henrici II and Gesta Regis Ricardi, revising the text and inserting some additional documents. From 1192, the Chronica is an independent and copious authority. Howden is sedulously impersonal, and makes no pretense to literary style, quotes documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His chronology is tolerably exact, but there are mistakes enough to prove that he recorded events at a certain distance of time. Both on foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he is unusually well informed. His practical experience as an administrator and his official connections stood him in good stead. He is particularly useful on points of constitutional history. His work breaks off abruptly in 1201, though he certainly intended to carry it further. Probably his death should be placed in that year. Works *Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi et Gesta Regis Ricardi Benedicti abbatis (ed.

Richmond Castle in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England, stands in a commanding position above the River Swale, close to the centre of the town of Richmond. It was originally called Riche Mount, 'the strong hill'. The castle was constructed by Alan Rufus from 1071 onwards following the Norman Conquest of England, and the Domesday Book of 1086 refers to 'a castlery' at Richmond. In the 12th century, his great-nephew Conan expanded the castle and built the keep. Although it was derelict by 1540, it was restored centuries later. The property is the best-preserved early Norman castle in England and an important tourist attraction. Layout A plan of Richmond Castle's main enclosure, keep, and the small enclosure around the keep. The outer enclosure is off to the east. Richmond Castle consists of four main parts: a triangular main enclosure, an outer enclosure to the east, a keep at the northern corner of the main enclosure, and a small enclosure around the keep. History Richmond Castle from across the River Swale In 1069 William the Conqueror had put down a rebellion at York which was followed by his \\"harrying of the North\\" ‚Äì an act of ethnic cleansing which depopulated large areas for a generation or more. As a further punishment, he divided up the lands of north Yorkshire among his most loyal followers. Alan Rufus, of Brittany, received the borough of RichmondAlan the Red, the Brit who makes Bill Gates a pauper The Sunday Times - 9 October 2007 and began constructing the castle to defend against further rebellions and to establish a personal power base. His holdings, called the Honour of Richmond, covered parts of eight counties and amounted to one of the most extensive Norman estates in England. A -high keep of honey-coloured sandstone was constructed at the end of the 12th century by Duke Conan IV of Brittany. The Earldom of Richmond was seized in 1158 by Henry II of England. It was King Henry II who probably completed the keep which had -thick walls. Modern visitors can climb to the top of the keep for magnificent views of the town of Richmond. At the same time that the keep was probably completed, Henry II considerably strengthened the castle by adding towers and a barbican. Henry III and King Edward I spent more money on the site including Edward's improvements to the keep interior. In addition to the main circuit of the wall, there was the barbican in front of the main gate which functioned as a sealed entry space, allowing visitors and wagons to be checked before they gained entry to the castle itself. On the other side of the castle, overlooking the river, was another enclosure or bailey called the Cockpit, which may have functioned as a garden and was overlooked by a balcony. A drawing of 1674 suggests there was another longer balcony overlooking the river side of Scolland's Hall, the Great Hall. The castle seen from the south Richmond Castle had fallen out of use as a fortress by the end of the 14th century and it did not receive major improvements after that date. A survey of 1538 shows it was partly in ruins, but paintings by Turner and others, together with the rise of tourism and an interest in antiquities, led to repairs to the keep in the early 19th century. In 1855 the castle became the headquarters of the North Yorkshire Militia, and a military barracks block was constructed in the great courtyard. For two years, from 1908 to 1910, the castle was the home of Robert Baden-Powell, later founder of the Boy Scouts, while he commanded the Northern Territorial Army but the barracks building was demolished in 1931. The castle was used during the First World War as the base of the Non-Combatant Corps made up of conscientious objectors ‚Äì conscripts who refused to fight. It was also used to imprison some conscientious objectors who refused to accept army discipline and participate in the war in any way. These included the \\"Richmond Sixteen\\" who were taken to France from the castle, charged under Field Regulations, and then sentenced to death, but their death sentences were commuted to ten years' hard labour. An illustration of the keep's basement The original 11th-century main gate arch is now in the basement of the later 12th century keep which was built in front of it; the original arch was unblocked in the 19th century. The castle is a scheduled monument, a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building and therefore recognised as an internationally important structure. According to legend, King Arthur and his knights are sleeping in a cave underneath the castle. It is said that they were once discovered by a potter named Thompson, who ran away when they began to awake. Another legend tells that a drummer boy was lost while investigating a tunnel, and that his ghostly drumming is sometimes heard around the castle.

The world's oldest mutual insurer, it pioneered age-based premiums based on mortality rate, laying \\"the framework for scientific insurance practice and development\\" and \\"the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based\\". After closing to new business in 2000, parts of the business were sold off and the remainder of the company became a subsidiary of Utmost Life and Pensions in January 2020. At its peak in the 1990s, Equitable had 1.5 million policyholders with funds worth ¬£26 billion under management, but it had allowed large unhedged liabilities to accumulate in respect of guaranteed fixed returns to investors without making provision for adverse market changes. Many policyholders lost half their life savings, and the company came close to collapse. Following a July 2000 House of Lords ruling, and the failure of attempts to find a buyer for the business, it closed to new business in December 2000 and reduced payouts to existing members. Lord Penrose's 2004 Equitable Life Inquiry found that the company had made over- generous payouts leading it to be under-funded. A 2007 European report concluded that regulators had focused on solvency margins and failed to consider the increasing risk of accrued terminal bonuses. In 2010, government announced compensation to policy-holders of ¬£1.5bn. In June 2018, Equitable Life announced that Life Company Consolidation Group (now Utmost Life and Pensions) had agreed to buy the company for ¬£1.8bn, with most policies to be transferred to Utmost's Reliance Life subsidiary and converted to unit-linked. Some of the proceeds of the sale would be returned to the remaining 400,000 policyholders in the form of increased bonuses on their policies. The sale completed at the end of 2019.  History  The Society, established via a Deed of Trust in September 1762 with the name of the \\"Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships\\", offered both whole life and fixed term policies. Premiums, which were constant for the duration of the policy, were based on a method devised by the mathematician James Dodson using mortality figures for Northampton and the amount payable on death, the basic sum assured, was guaranteed, a major advantage at the time. As Dodson had died five years earlier, Edward Rowe Mores became its chief executive officer with the title of actuary‚Äîthe first use of the term‚Äîthough he was an administrator rather than a statistician. The first modern actuary, William Morgan, was appointed in 1775 and served until 1830. In 1776 the Society carried out the first actuarial valuation of liabilities and subsequently distributed the first reversionary bonus (1781) and interim bonus (1809) among its members. It also used regular valuations to balance competing interests. Its products therefore met the description of a modern with-profits policy. The Society sought to treat its members equitably and the directors tried to ensure that the policyholders received a fair return on their respective investments. Throughout the Society's history, the allocation of bonuses (at regular intervals of up to five years) was a carefully thought-through decision based on actuarial advice, designed to promote fairness and equity between different groups and generations of policyholders. Its methods were successful enough for it to be able to reduce its premiums by 10% in 1777, and there was a further reduction in 1781. By 1799 the Society had assets of ¬£4m and its 5,000 membership subsequently doubled to 10,000 in 1810. Famous 19th-century policyholders included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wilberforce and Sir Walter Scott. In 1870, the Life Assurance Companies Act was passed, \\"requiring all life offices to publish financial data on the lines so long followed by the Equitable.\\" In the 20th century, Henry Manly devised the concept and theory of staff pensions, which the Society marketed from 1913. Pensions became available to the self-employed in 1957 when the Society launched the Retirement annuity plan. Corporate pension scheme members included employees of the NHS, Unilever and the Post Office. Organisation The Society's first offices were in the parsonage of St Nicholas Acons in Nicholas Lane, London, moving to Blackfriars in 1774. Approval of policies, the main business of the Society, was undertaken by the Court of Directors; whilst resolutions had to be approved at two meetings of the General Court which all members were entitled to attend. From 1786 this court also dealt with grievances, and there was early tension between initial subscribers wanting a return on investment and those wanting to recruit new members. In 1816 a waiting period was introduced for new members, and only the oldest 5,000 policies were entitled to bonuses. In 1893 the Memorandum and Articles of Association were adopted, incorporating the Society as \\"The Equitable Life Assurance Society\\" and transferring power to the directors; the 1816 membership and bonus restrictions were removed. The Society moved to Mansion House Street in 1863, Coleman Street in 1924 (both in the City of London) and new offices in Aylesbury in January 1983. The archives of the Society from 1762 to 1975 are held by the Institute of Actuaries. The Society acquired the University Life Assurance Society and the Reversionary Interest Society in 1919 and the Equitable Reversionary Interest Society in 1920. Guaranteed Annuity Rates, Article 65 and the 1999 Hyman case Many of Equitable's with-profits policies were designed to provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing. Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee. In 1979, legislation allowed the lump sum to be transferred to another annuity provider. As a result, communications with policyholders increasingly focused on the lump sum rather than annuity benefits. The GAR was calculated using an interest yield of 4% per annum until 1975 when it was increased to 7%. By May 2001, of Equitable's 1.1m policyholders about 16% held a GAR option. During the 1980s and 1990s Equitable experienced a further period of rapid growth. It developed market-leading personal pension and additional voluntary contribution plans while maintaining its record of operating with one of the lowest expense ratios in the industry. Its success was \\"partly based on its reputation, its strategy of paying no commissions to insurance agents or independent advisers and its tactic of always keeping reserves low and returning to its members more money than other companies\\". In 1993 the CAR fell below the guaranteed annuity rate, thus prompting GAR policyholders to exercise their rights. According to actuary Christopher Headdon, policies issued from 1975 to 1988 were worth approximately 25% more than CARs; the total difference amounted to some ¬£1 billion to ¬£1.5 billion. Based on an affidavit sworn by Christopher Headdon on 28 June 1999, \\"from the 1980s onwards, Equitable was aware of the GAR risk. ... At no time did Equitable ever hedge or reinsure adequately against the GAR risk to counteract it. The reason for this was Equitable's belief that it could ... neutralise the potential effect of the GAR risk through the exercise of its discretion to allocate final bonuses under Article 65\\" (of the Articles of Association). In 1994, Equitable exercised its discretion under that Article to reduce the terminal bonus of those policies with Guaranteed Annuity Rates, negating the benefit from the guarantee but preserving the assets of non-GAR policyholders. By July 1998 there were a number of complaints to the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman and it was decided to seek a declaratory judgement. David Hyman was selected as the representative policyholder. Hearings started in July 1999, and in September the High Court ruled in the Equitable's favour; but this was reversed by the Appeal Court in January 2000. The Equitable now sought a ruling by the House of Lords. House of Lords ruling on the Hyman case On 20 July 2000 the House of Lords upheld the Appeal Court ruling. They concluded that GAR policies required that the guaranteed rate was applied to calculate the contractual annuity; and that the effect of the differential terminal bonus rates was that the annuity was calculated at current annuity rates, not at the guaranteed rate, and was not lawful. \\"The self-evident commercial object of the inclusion of guaranteed rates in the policy is to protect the policyholder against a fall in market annuity rates ... The supposition of the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors would not exercise their discretion [in Article 65] in conflict with contractual rights.\\" Even before that stage, Equitable, which had long claimed to be more transparent than its rivals, had assets worth ¬£3 billion less than communications with policyholders had indicated. Aftermath of the Hyman case and partial sales, 2001‚Äì9 Having not insured against losing the case, and with no other way to make provision for the immediate ¬£1.5 billion increase in long-term liabilities, Equitable put itself up for sale. By the end of July, about ten companies, including the Prudential, had considered, but rejected a bid. Equitable had intended using money from the sale to allocate bonuses for the first seven months of 2000, but now this was not available. On 8 December 2000 it closed to new business, and immediately set a Market Value Adjustment of 10% which was later increased to 15%. On 19 December, HM Treasury announced a review of the Financial Services Authority (FSA)'s regulation of Equitable. The following day, Equitable announced that their President and seven non- executive directors would step down. Vanni Treves became Chairman in March 2001, with Charles Thomson as Chief Executive. On 4 February 2001 the Halifax agreed to buy Equitable's operating assets, salesforce and non-profit business for a payment of up to ¬£1 billion into the with-profits fund, subject to policyholder agreement. On 20 September 2001, compromise proposals were published offering 17.5% increase for GARs in exchange for the guarantee and 2.5% for non-GARs in exchange for abandoning any legal claim. The deal was accepted by 98% of GAR policyholders, and was sanctioned by the High Court in February 2002. Both groups of policyholders (those whose pensions had vested and those that had not) received further bad news. In July 2001 deferred pensioners (the second group) were angered to be told their savings had been reduced by 16%, and then in November 2002 pensioners were told that \\"with- profits annuities, like yours, are now out of line by about 30%.\\" 50,000 annuitants suffered a 20% reduction in income. In February 2007, Equitable completed the transfer of ¬£4.6 billion of annuities to Canada Life, and in November transferred all ¬£1.8 billion of with-profits annuity policies to Prudential, a deal accepted by 98% of members voting at a meeting. In November 2008, Equitable announced that the sale of the Society would be put on hold and that the Board would instead review the arrangements to run off its existing business. Gross assets as of December 2008 were ¬£8,754 million, around 25% of the value in 2000. Treves stepped down as chairman in September 2009 and was replaced by Ian Brimecome. 2001 reports by the actuarial profession and FSA In May 2001, Ian Glick QC and Richard Snowden published their joint opinion on behalf of the Financial Services Authority. This concluded that there was an arguable case that the Equitable had breached the rules of its former regulators, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) and the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) in failing to disclose the risk of the existing GAR policies in the Product Particulars, Key Features and With-Profits Guide to new non-GAR policy holders. This was followed in September by the Corley Report on behalf of the Institute of Actuaries, which recommended, amongst other things, that the Appointed Actuary should require that there is a process for reviewing communications to policyholders, and should resist holding a dual role as Chief Executive, and that his work should be subject to peer review. In October, the Baird Report was published. This covered the Financial Services Authority's regulation of Equitable from 1 January 1999 to 8 December 2000, when the Society closed to new business. The report was produced by the FSA's director of internal audit with the help of independent accountants and lawyers. The review found that ‚Äì with hindsight ‚Äì there had been some \\"deficiencies\\" on the part of the FSA in the discharge of their regulatory responsibilities, but also stated that \\"the die had been cast\\" by the time the FSA had assumed regulatory responsibility for the Society, in relation to those who had already invested in Equitable. The Penrose report, 2004 The Penrose report, commissioned by the Treasury in August 2001 and expected in 2002, was finally published in March 2004 after delays due to vetting by Treasury lawyers. The 818-page report found that the company had made over-generous payouts to policyholders, reaching the stage where \\"The Society was under-funded to the extent of ¬£4¬Ω billion in the summer of 2001\\" (chapter 19, para 82). Penrose said: \\"Principally, the Society was author of its own misfortunes. Regulatory system failures were secondary factors\\". He also accused the former Equitable management team of \\"dubious\\" practices and nurturing a \\"culture of manipulation and concealment\\". The Report was debated in parliament on 24 March 2004. European Parliament investigation, 2007 In June 2007 the European Parliament issued a 385-page report on Equitable Life. Its fifteen-month investigation followed the implementation in July 2004 of EC Directive 92/96/EEC (the Third Life Directive or 3LD), which governs the single market in life insurance. This directive required the UK, where Equitable's headquarters were, to supervise its \\"entire business\\", and curtailed the supervisory power of other EU countries where Equitable operated. The EU Parliament's remit was to investigate, without prejudice, alleged breaches of Community law in relation to the collapse, to assess the UK regulatory regime in respect of Equitable Life, and to look at the adequacy of remedies available to policyholders including the 15,000 non-UK members. The 22-member committee heard evidence from 38 witnesses and analysed 92 public documents, and its report is the only one completely independent of UK Government influence. Whilst a detailed summary of the full document is well outside the scope of this article, an examination of the effectiveness of the supervision of Equitable is given below and closely follows the wording. * Financial supervision covering the Assurance undertaking's entire business. The evidence suggests that the regulator focused exclusively on solvency margins, and took little or no account of accrued terminal bonuses in its overall analysis of the financial health of the company. It quotes Penrose as saying that the Policyholders' Reasonable Expectations (PRE) would have included terminal bonus even if the amount was not defined; however the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) and the Treasury deny PRE existed as the terminal bonus was not guaranteed. The report goes on to say that if it is considered that these types of bonuses are an integral part of the company's \\"entire business\\", the regulatory authorities should have taken them into account. Although the regulator was given the option of not forcing Equitable to build reserves for discretionary bonuses, that did not absolve the authorities from their duty of financial supervision covering the \\"assurance undertaking's entire business\\". * Every insurance company is required to have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms. Though the Appointed Actuary (AA) is not a role required by the directive, it was an essential part of the UK's own system of insurance regulation. Inter alia, the AA was required to act as a guardian of policyholders' interests; but the overall evidence suggests that \\"the UK regulator did not fulfil its obligation ... in that Roy Ranson became CEO without relinquishing his role as the Appointed Actuary.\\" The Treasury rejected this claim as the 3LD does not mention the AA. The overall evidence received suggested that by not taking swift action on this matter, the UK regulator did not fulfil its obligation to require from Equitable sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms, as required explicitly. * Ensure that the competent authorities have the powers and means necessary for the supervision of assurance undertakings. The UK had the legal power to supervise Equitable. The Baird report stated that in January 1999, the total number of staff involved in the Government's prudential regulation of about 200 insurance companies was less than 135. The Penrose report also states that \\"the DTI insurance division was ill equipped to participate in the regulatory process. It had inadequate staff and those involved at line supervisor level in particular were not qualified to make any significant contribution to the process. For all practical purposes, scrutiny of the actuarial functioning of life offices was in the hands of GAD until the reorganisation under FSA was in place\\". More evidence also strongly suggests that the regulator adopted a conscious and deliberate \\"hands-off\\" approach with regard to the Equitable case. If this were proven to be the case, it would constitute a breach of the regulator's obligation to ensure the respect of PRE and therefore a breach of the letter and aim of Article 10 of the 3LD. Both the Baird and Penrose reports contain criticisms of the regulator's lack of a \\"pro-active approach\\". In its conclusion on p. 117, the report said that the powers bestowed on the Secretary of State (as prescribed by Section 68 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982) to waive the application of prudential regulations appear to be incompatible with the letter and the aim of the Directive, and were used inappropriately (particularly when granting authorisation on numerous occasions to include future profits in the assets available to meet the solvency margin), and that therefore ... there are serious concerns that the 3LD was not correctly transposed in full. \\"The committee is of the opinion that the application of the 3LD by the UK in respect of the ELAS case was deficient and that UK regulators and authorities did not adequately respect the ultimate purpose of the Directive.\\" Legal actions by Equitable Life, 2005 In April 2005, in the light of Penrose's findings, Equitable started a ¬£2 billion High Court action against auditors Ernst & Young, reduced 3 months later to ¬£0.7 billion, claiming they had failed to inform the directors of the seriousness of its position. However lawyers advised they could not prove that correct advice would have changed the outcome, and the case was dropped in September. Ernst & Young described the case as \\"ill conceived\\". Simultaneously, Equitable started a ¬£3.3 billion claim against former directors, claiming that they failed in their duties to policyholders. This claim was abandoned in December 2005; the costs of the two cases amounted to around ¬£40m. Government response and the Parliamentary Ombudsman, 2008‚Äì9 In July 2008, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman completed a four- year investigation, described by Equitable's chief executive as the \\"best chance of compensation\\". Her 2,819-page report accused the regulators, i.e. the DTI, GAD, and FSA, of \\"comprehensive failure\\", found the Government guilty of ten counts of maladministration, and called for a compensation scheme \\"to put those people who have suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in, had maladministration not occurred\\". Equitable's chairman estimated that 30,000 policyholders had already died without receiving compensation. In December, the European Parliament issued a press release describing the regulatory failure as an outrage. In January 2009 the Government issued their response and appointed retired judge Sir John Chadwick as an independent advisor to design an ex-gratia scheme for some policyholders \\"who have suffered a disproportionate impact as a result of the relevant maladministration\\". The Ombudsman accused the government of twisting the findings of her report by suggesting that whatever the regulators had done, it would have made no difference to the events which followed. She also said it had failed to give \\"cogent reasons\\" for rejecting some of her findings, mandatory since the Pensions Action Group Judicial Review. In March, the Public Administration Select Committee issued a second report in which it described the government response as \\"morally unacceptable\\", and repeated the Ombudsman's criticism that it had acted as judge on its own behalf. In May, the Ombudsman issued a supplementary report to the government's reply. In August 2009, Chadwick issued an interim report.  Government response, 2010  In the Queen's Speech following the formation of a Conservative-LibDem coalition government in 2010, the Equitable Life (Payments) Bill was announced. The bill sought to secure compensation for nearly a million policyholders (UK-wide) hit by the near-collapse of the insurer. The Government also announced that the final report from Sir John Chadwick in relation to Equitable Life would be received by mid-July. A statement on the HM Treasury website confirmed two elements of the design of the scheme: that there should be no means testing, and that the dependents of deceased policyholders should be included in the scheme. The July 2010 announcement by Mark Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, offered compensation starting by mid-2011 to 1.5m savers. However, policyholder compensation would be limited to the \\"absolute loss they suffered\\" estimated by Chadwick at a total of ¬£2.3-¬£3B, compared with the ¬£4B-¬£4.8B returns that similar companies produced, as calculated by consultants Towers Watson. Sir John, whose report was designed to compensate those who suffered \\"disproportionately\\", recommended a payment cap for each policyholder which would reduce total compensation to between ¬£400m and ¬£500m. Hoban said compensation would follow recommendations of the Parliamentary Ombudsman report and would take Sir John's findings into account, but might be affected by public spending cuts. Total compensation would be announced in the public spending review in October. Equitable Life pressure group EMAG were unhappy with the announcement but the Ombudsman said she would inform Parliament of her views once she had had time to consider the statement. Although Equitable‚Äôs management initially welcomed the announcement, they were concerned that compensation would be based on the Chadwick report, written on the premise that only five of the Ombudsman‚Äôs findings of maladministration were valid. In opposition, Hoban had promised that all ten counts would be considered. Equitable's Chief Executive, Chris Wiscarson, wrote to Hoban saying that they could not support Chadwick‚Äôs recommendations as they would only cover about 10% of losses and that compensation should be based on a total figure of ¬£4.8B. On 20 October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Spending Review Statement that the compensation package would be around ¬£1.5billion. Chancellor's Spending Review Statement, 20 October 2010 However, in 2013, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said that 200,000 people could miss out because of a lack of publicity ahead of the 2014 deadline. The report called on the Treasury and its administrator, National Savings and Investments, to \\"get their act together\\" and bring forward publicity for the deadline to July rather than September 2013. By March 2012, payments were only one third of that expected and Committee chairman Margaret Hodge also criticized the Treasury for destroying details of 353,000 policyholders on data protection grounds. In response, a Government Treasury spokesman criticized the Labour party for ignoring the problem for ten years.  Sale to Utmost, 2019  In June 2018, Equitable Life announced that Life Company Consolidation Group (LCCG) had agreed to buy the company for ¬£1.8bn, with policies to be transferred to LCCG's Reliance Life subsidiary and converted to unit-linked. LCCG (now Utmost Life and Pensions) is backed by Oaktree Capital Management and specialises in buying insurance businesses that are closed to new customers. Some of the proceeds of the sale would be returned to the remaining 400,000 policyholders in the form of increased bonuses on their policies. The sale required approval by policyholders and the High Court, and, having received this, completed at the end of 2019, with UK policies transferring to Utmost Life and Pensions. Irish and German policies remain with the Equitable Life, now a subsidiary of Utmost Life and Pensions.

Crawley was planned and laid out as a New Town after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings. Northgate was one of the four in the \\"inner ring\\" closest to the town centre, and was the second to be completed: almost all building work on the site took place in the first half of the 1950s. Northgate is bordered by West Green to the west, Langley Green to the north, Three Bridges to the east and the town centre and Southgate to the south. It is one of the smaller neighbourhoods in the town, but has the standard range of buildings as proposed in the 1940s masterplan: churches, a pub, a shopping parade, a primary school, and housing of various styles and layouts. Some older, pre-New Town buildings remain, including three with listed status and the locally listed Dyers Almshouses, which form part of the surviving interwar development in this part of the town. History For most of its history, Crawley was a slowly growing market town whose focus was the north‚Äìsouth High Street, part of the main London to Brighton road. This was turnpiked in 1770, and at the northern and southern limits of the parish tollgates were erected‚Äîthe North Gate and the South Gate. The section of road north of Crawley, called London Road, was widened in the early 1930s and bypassed a few years later to form the present A23. The tollgate was close to Boscobel House, a 17th-century timber-framed house which is now a listed building, and a long-established coaching inn called the Rising Sun. In the New Town era the inn was converted into a restaurant and later demolished, along with most of the other buildings along this section of London Road (including a public hall called Victoria Hall and a London Transport bus garage). The area now covered by the Northgate neighbourhood was, until World War II, an area of mostly open land lying northeast of the town centre, whose focus was still the ancient High Street and its northward continuation London Road. Much of the area was covered by Woolborough Farm, part of the Crabbet Park estate which had been owned by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and his family. Most of the estate was auctioned in 1916. The farm and its facilities were described in the auction catalogue as comprising \\"a picturesque farmhouse, two cottages and homestead of agricultural buildings, together with of arable land, of well-timbered and shaded pastures and cool meadows, [and] two pieces of woodland\\". None of this survives, apart from in the name of Woolborough Road: postwar housing now covers the land. Early 1950s terraced housing on Woodfield Road, with extensive green space in front The fields of the Crabbet Park estate were interspersed with allotments, and after the estate was broken up some housing was built, mostly directly off the London Road: Tushmore Lane, Cobbles Crescent and Woolborough Road had interwar ribbon development, there was some opposite The Sun Inn at the south end of London Road before it became Crawley High Street, and some \\"typical 1930s housing\\" on Green Lane. Altogether, 229 houses existed in the designated area at the start of World War II. A group of almshouses were built in 1939‚Äì40 on Northgate Road for the Worshipful Company of Dyers, a London livery company, which had moved from an older building in Islington. Crawley was designated as a New Town in January 1947 after the New Towns Act 1946 identified it as a suitable site for one. Crawley Development Corporation was formed, led by the architect Thomas Bennett, and planner Anthony Minoprio provided a master plan for the town's development. He proposed a double ring of nine neighbourhoods surrounding an extended town centre. Northgate was to form the northern part of the inner ring, between the town centre and the northern section of the planned Crawley ring road. Crawley Development Corporation's second annual report (1949) stated that Northgate was the second planned neighbourhood of nine, after West Green. Although 13 neighbourhoods were built in the end, the order of construction of the early neighbourhoods remained unchanged. Work got underway in 1950, when 162 houses were built. A higher proportion of flats was provided than elsewhere in Crawley: one-quarter of the residential units built in the early years were flats, and flats eventually made up 13% of Northgate's housing stock overall. Crawley Development Corporation also built 142 concrete houses, unique in the town, in 1955. Each New Town neighbourhood was to have a \\"neighbourhood centre\\" with shops, one or more churches, a pub, a primary school and a community centre. Work started on Northgate's in 1952 and the 13 shops were completed in 1953. Northgate suffered from the same problems and inconveniences in its first years as the other early neighbourhoods. No pavements were provided; streets lacked lighting and were either dusty or muddy; and potholes were common. There were also design errors at the main shopping parade: the pillar box was erected outside a chemist's shop instead of the post office, and all of the flats above the shops were mistakenly given the same door lock and key. Queen Elizabeth II visited Crawley in June 1958, principally to open Gatwick Airport; but she visited Northgate and toured the Territorial Army centre in Kilnmead among other places. Location within Crawley Northgate street sign The Crawley Borough area, showing the 13 neighbourhoods; Northgate (including the town centre and Manor Royal industrial estate) is shown in pine green The designated area of Crawley New Town according to Anthony Minoprio's masterplan was , of which was to be developed at first. Northgate was to cover immediately north of the expanded town centre. Anticlockwise from the south, the neighbourhood is bounded by The Boulevard (forming the northern limit of the town centre), Northgate Avenue (the A2004), Crawley Avenue (the A2011) and London Road, historically the main north‚Äìsouth route through the town but now bypassed and downgraded. When the New Town was planned, each neighbourhood was allocated a colour, which appears on street name signs together with the neighbourhood's name. Northgate's colour is pine green. Governance When Crawley Urban District was formed in May 1956, it was divided into eight wards whose boundaries were identical with those of eight of the extant and planned neighbourhoods. By 1983, nine years after the district became a borough, the town had thirteen wards. This position remained the same until an electoral review in 2002, which created two new wards. Throughout these changes, Northgate's ward boundaries remained the same. As well as the residential part of the neighbourhood, they cover the town centre to the south and the Manor Royal industrial estate to the north. The ward elects two councillors. In 2002 it was stated that the electorate in Northgate was 3,515 people, rising to an expected 3,918 in 2006; this made it one of the smallest wards in the town. Demography The administrative ward of Northgate covers the residential neighbourhood, the town centre and Manor Royal industrial estate. Wards are used for collecting census and other statistical and demographic data. Northgate's population was 5,298 at the time of the 2011 United Kingdom census. The ward covers , giving a population density of , but much of the area covered by the ward is non-residential. At the time of the 2011 census Crawley as a whole had 106,597 residents and a population density of . At the census date there were 2,259 households in Northgate, of which 1,041 (46%) were owned by the occupier, 592 (26%) were rented from Crawley Borough Council or another public-sector landlord, 550 (24%) were rented privately and 33 (1.5%) were occupied rent-free. These proportions were significantly different from the housing tenure mix of Crawley as a whole, where 59% of residences were owned by the occupier, 24% were socially rented (from the council or another public body), 14.5% were privately rented and 1.2% were occupied rent-free. Housing types in Northgate were also different from in Crawley as a whole. Detached, semi-detached and terraced houses made up 8.3%, 17% and 38.4% respectively of the housing in Northgate, 32.9% of residences were flats in purpose-blocks, 2% were flats above commercial premises, and 1.3% were converted premises such as bedsits. In Crawley overall, detached, semi-detached and terraced houses made up 13.9%, 20.7% and 41.6% of the housing stock respectively; 22.3% of residences were in purpose-built flats; 0.5% were flats above commercial premises, and 0.9% were converted premises of other types. According to the census, 74% of Northgate residents were White, 18.9% were Asian or Asian-British, 3.2% were Black or Black-British, 2.6% were mixed-race and 1.2% were from another ethnic background. The proportion of white people was lower, and that of Asian people higher, than in Crawley overall; other proportions were comparable to Crawley as a whole. Northgate's age profile at the census date was slightly older than that of Crawley as a whole, in common with the other inner neighbourhoods: 19.1% of residents were under 18 years old, 21.8% were between 18 and 29 years old, 41.4% were between 30 and 59, and 17.8% were 60 or older. The corresponding proportions for the borough overall were 23.3%, 17.1%, 42.3% and 17.4%. The mean and median ages were both about one year higher in Northgate than in Crawley as a whole. Northgate was the second of the three earliest New Town neighbourhoods, all of which \\"were intended to house the builders of the New Town and the earliest unskilled settlers\\". The mix of occupations in the neighbourhood still reflects this: there are lower proportions of residents working in the highest categories of the census-defined hierarchy of occupations, and higher proportions in the lowest categories, than in the borough as a whole. Buildings and facilities St Elizabeth's Church was built in 1958 for Northgate's Anglican worshippers. It was part of the parish of St John the Baptist's Church, Crawley. The building was extended in the mid-1960s. It is a simple brick hall with windows in the clerestory and a small fl√®che on the roof. Its role as a church has been downgraded since 2005, when weekly services ceased; occasional services are still held, but its principal use is now by New Generation Performing Arts, formerly the Louise Ryrie School of Dance and Drama. The parish of St Richard's Church, Three Bridges now covers Northgate and is involved with New Generation, which it describes as \\"a Christian performing arts group for children and young people\\". Crawley's main Methodist church, St Paul's, was built in the neighbourhood centre in 1953‚Äì55. A new church was built alongside in 1966 and the original building became the church hall. The 1966 building is polygonal and has a multi-gabled copper roof. There is exposed timberwork inside. A Kingdom Hall was built for Jehovah's Witnesses on a nearby site in 1983. It was registered for worship in April 1983 (originally on behalf of the Ifield Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses) and for marriages in 1991. Separate infants and junior schools were opened by West Sussex County Council in 1954, replacing a temporary school provided two years previously. They became a first school and a middle school respectively when education facilities in the town were reconfigured in 1971. Like the other New Town schools, it was designed by West Sussex county architect F.R. Steele. The schools now been amalgamated into one entity called Northgate Primary School; it takes children from ages 3 (nursery class) to 11 (Year 6). Many of the neighbourhood pubs made architectural reference to the Regency style and have been altered over the years. The example at Northgate, the Black Dog, has a \\"jolly Regency bow\\". A temporary hut for community activities was built in Northgate by 1954; it was replaced by the present community centre, a permanent building, in 1963. The following year, its lease was one of the first to be taken on by the Crawley Council for Voluntary Service, which operated all the neighbourhoods' community centres by the mid-1980s. Also in 1964 a separate youth club building was erected. There is a Territorial Army centre on Kilnmead. It is the Battalion Headquarters of 103 Battalion, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The building also houses an Army Careers Information Office. Heritage Three of the 100 listed buildings and structures in the borough of Crawley are in Northgate. Boscobel House is at the south end of London Road close to where it becomes Crawley High Street, very close to the former Northgate tollgate. The building, which is now an office, was built as a two- storey timber-framed cottage in the late 17th century and was given a brick and tile fa√ßade a century later. The roof is also tiled. Black Dog Cottage is a 16th-century farmhouse which retains its original timber framing, although it was given a brick fa√ßade in the 19th century. Another original feature is the chimney, which sits on the steep tiled hipped roof. The rear elevation is weatherboarded. Fir Tree Cottage is another timber-framed building, although it is later: it was built in the late 17th or early 18th century. By 1792 it was in use as the Crawley parish workhouse. A mixture of brickwork, tiles, stucco and exposed timberwork can be seen on the exterior of the building, which (like Black Dog Cottage) is now a private house. It is on the east side of London Road. There were 59 locally listed buildings in Crawley as of 2010, including one in Northgate. Dyers Almshouses are a \\"charming\\" complex of single-storey almshouses designed in the Arts and Crafts style by architect W.H. Hatchard-Smith of the Bertram & Co. firm in 1939‚Äì40. Their prominent tiled gables are \\"reminiscent of rural Dutch cottages\\", and each is topped with a large chimney. Only ten of the houses, which are set in a quadrangle around a garden, are original; another 16 were built to the same design in 1952, and four more were added in 1971. They were among the many buildings built in Crawley and the surrounding area by local building firm James Longley and Co. The buildings are also part of the Dyers Almshouses Conservation Area, one of 11 conservation areas in the borough. Transport Metrobus route 100, part of the Crawley Fastway network, runs through Northgate along Woodfield Road, calling at several stops in the neighbourhood. The route serves Maidenbower, Three Bridges, Crawley town centre, the Manor Royal industrial estate and business district, Lowfield Heath, Gatwick Airport and the Surrey towns of Horley and Redhill. Several stops along London Road, the western boundary of the neighbourhood, are served by routes 4 and 5 (Gatwick Airport‚ÄìLowfield Heath‚ÄìLangley Green‚ÄìCrawley town centre‚ÄìThree Bridges‚ÄìPound Hill) and 10 (Gatwick Airport‚ÄìManor Royal‚ÄìCrawley town centre‚ÄìSouthgate‚ÄìBroadfield‚ÄìBewbush).

The organization acquired its present name, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, with the transition of the state into the status of Republic of Sri Lanka on 22 May 1972. SLBC ( Stand for Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) has since continued in the same legal status as a state corporation, and is currently listed under the scope of the ministry of Information and Media of the Government of Sri Lanka.List of ministries of Sri Lanka Transition from AM to FM SLBC relied on mediumwave as its primary mode of domestic broadcasting until the 1990s. Some sporadic FM broadcasts were already introduced at several relay stations more as a means of expanding the broadcasts to medium wave repeaters stations. However, by the late 1980s. This was followed by the ‚ÄòIsland FM Development Project‚Äô that was launched in year 1995. The objectives of the project were to develop an Islandwide multi-channel FM stereo broadcast transmission network and to divest the costly domestic medium wave transmitting stations, which were typically broadcasting only one or two programme channels per transmitting station. By 1999, more than 95% country‚Äôs total population was being covered by SLBC‚Äôs FM transmissions with nearly 90% of them receiving all six nationwide channels. Radio services Currently, SLBC's domestic FM network broadcasts 6 radio stations on a nationwide basis, which are: *Sinhala Swadeshiya Sevaya‚Äô (Sinhala National Service) *Tamil National Service * English Service *City FM (Sinhala) *Velenda Sevaya‚Äô (Sinhala Commercial Service) *Thendral (Tamil Commercial Service)  Hindi service  Radio Ceylon had a Hindi service that was launched in the early 1950s. Millions of rupees in terms of advertising revenue came from India through the efforts of Dan Molina, Frank Courtney, and S. Hariharan (the director of the Malayalam film Vayanadan Thamban). The three operated Radio Advertising Services as the advertising agents of Radio Ceylon. The station employed some of the most popular Indian announcers who played a vital role in establishing Radio Ceylon as the 'King of the airwaves' in South Asia, among them, the Ganjwar sisters, Vimla and Kamini, Vijay Kishore Dubey, Gopal Sharma, Hasan Razvi, Kumar and Manohar Mahajan, Sunil Dutt (who went on to become a film star in Bollywood), Ameen Sayani and elder brother Hamid Sayani, though not hired by Radio Ceylon became popular by using Radio Ceylon for broadcasting programs like \\"Binaca Geetmala\\" (first broadcast in 1952) and \\"Lipton Ke Sitaare.\\" Group picture of Announcers of Radio Ceylon in the year 1953 Its most popular features were film songs. While the golden age of Hindi- language film music was in the 1950s and 1960s, the station popularised movie songs, including the ones form Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, K.L. Saigal, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Mohammed Rafi, S. Janaki and others. The radio station took advantage of the situation as Bollywood film music was banned by All India Radio and other Indian radio stations at the time. This led to increased listenership for radio programmes such as Binaca Geetmala. The Binaca Hit Parade was presented by Greg Roskowski, it was a countdown of English pop music beamed on the Commercial Service and the All Asia Service. Having heard the programme, the audience flooded the station with letters requesting a count down of Hindi-language filmi songs and the idea of Binaca Geetmala was born. Radio Ceylon also popularised English songs of Indian popular musicians - they went on to score huge hits, among them Uma Pocha (Bombay Meri Hai), Usha Uthup who has the rare distinction of singing Sri Lankan baila songs with ease and the Anglo-Indian star, Ernest Ignatius (who went on to be a success in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Bombay Dreams' in London) had a massive hit, I married a female wrestler, on the Hindi service. The station recorded jingles and beamed them on the All Asia Service - from Lux soap to Coca-Cola. Major brands queued up for their jingles to be broadcast live by the announcers of Radio Ceylon, such was the station's advertising power. M  Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation  Director General Neville Jayaweera in the boardroom of Radio Ceylon. Radio Ceylon became a public corporation on 30 September 1967 and the station's name was changed to the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation. Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake appointed a distinguished Ceylonese civil servant, Neville Jayaweera to head the CBC. When Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972 the station underwent yet another name change as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). In December 2005 Sri Lanka celebrated its 80th anniversary .

He is known for his study of languages as a key for classifying ancient peoples and being able to trace their migrations. He was the first to analyze and confirm that the Tutelo language of some Virginia Native Americans belonged to the Siouan family, which was most associated with the western Dakota and Hidatsa languages. He also identified the Cherokee language of the tribe that was associated with the inland American Southeast as a member of the Iroquoian family of languages. Most of the speakers of the latter occupied territory to the east and south of the Great Lakes, in present-day New York, Pennsylvania, with excursions into Ohio. In addition, he published a work, Iroquois Book of Rites (1883), based on his translation of their only two known historic manuscripts, supported by studies with tribal elders in interpreting the Iroquois wampum belts to establish the people's prehistory. Born in New Hampshire and educated in New England, Hale traveled from 1838‚Äì1842 with the United States Exploring Expedition, being appointed because of his skills as their philologist and ethnologist before he had finished his undergraduate degree at Harvard College. After his marriage to a Canadian woman in 1855, Hale settled with her in Ontario. He continued to publish articles in American scholarly journals, while living in Canada for the rest of his life. Early life and education Horatio Hale was born on 3 May 1817, at Newport, New Hampshire, in the United States, the son of David Hale, a lawyer, and of Sarah Josepha. After the death of her husband, Sarah Josepha Hale turned to writing and became a prominent magazine editor. Entering Harvard College in 1833, Hale showed a marked faculty for languages. His first original work was published the next year, and attracted the attention of the college authorities. It consisted of an Algonkin vocabulary, which he gathered from a band of Indians who had camped on the college grounds. Career Three years later, when the United States Exploring Expedition to little-known portions of the globe was organised under Charles Wilkes, Hale was recommended, while yet an undergraduate, for the post of ethnologist and philologist. He was appointed to the position. From 1838 to 1842, Hale worked with the expedition, visiting South America, Australasia, Polynesia, and North-western America, then known as Oregon Country. From this point he returned overland. The Hale Passages of Puget Sound were named in recognition of his service to the expedition. The expedition traveled also to Polynesia. Of the reports of that expedition, Hale prepared the sixth volume, Ethnography and Philology (1846), which is said to have laid the foundations of the ethnography of Polynesia. He continued to travel and study abroad. Having completed his degree of M. A. at Harvard, Hale made a short tour of Europe. On his return, he studied law, and was admitted to the Chicago bar in 1855. That year he married a woman from Canada, whom he met in Ontario. In 1856, the Hales moved to Clinton, Ontario, Canada, where he administered the estate of his father-in-law. He began to get involved in local real estate development and other business and educational endeavours. He continued to reside in Clinton till his death, devoting much attention to the development of the Ontario school system. He was influential in introducing co-education of the sexes in high schools and collegiate institutes, in increasing the grants to these institutions, in establishing the normal school system, and in improving the methods of examination. The vicinity of the Canadian reserves on the banks of the Thames and Grand River gave Hale ample opportunity for further investigation into American-Indian questions. He discovered two Indian manuscripts, dating between 1714 and 1735; these manuscripts are the only known literary American Indian work extant. In 1883 he published The Iroquois Book of Rites (reprinted 1963 by University of Toronto Press), which included his translated and edited versions of these papers. In addition, he had material from his studies and interviews with tribal elders as to the interpretations of the Iroquois wampum belts to develop an account of their prehistory. According to Browning, Hale's judicious introductions, careful translation and editing add much to the value of the work. In 1884, he reorganised the section of anthropology as an independent department of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting in Montreal that year. He had already performed a like service for the American Association. At the request of the British committee, he undertook the supervision of the anthropological section's work in the Canadian North-west and British Columbia. The reports, which are very elaborate, were published in the Association's Proceedings from 1885 to 1897. While Hale continued as a member of the committee, he was asked to accept the position of vice-president at the Association's meeting in Toronto (1896); he declined due to ill-health. Hale was an honorary fellow of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, to which he contributed his latest papers. He died on 29 December 1896 at Clinton, Ontario. Family In 1854, at Jersey City, New Jersey , he married Margaret Pugh. Her father William was formerly justice of the peace for the township of Goderich in Huron County, Canada West (now Ontario). Native American studies In Canada Hale returned to his study of First Nations and Native Americans. He was mentored by the Iroquois chiefs George Henry Martin Johnson and John Fraser, whom he met while visiting the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Ontario. In addition he traveled to the United States to consult with other native informants. Hale documented the oral history and rituals of the Iroquois Confederacy. He was assisted in interpreting the group's wampum belts, which recounted their history. As a result of this work, he published The Iroquois Book of Rites (1883). He also studied the Iroquois languages, determining that Mohawk was the oldest. He also concluded that the Laurentian languages were Iroquoian. Archeologists and linguists have since confirmed that the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were an early people who had occupied territory in what is now considered upper New England and along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and Ontario from about the 14th century to about 1580.Warrick, Gray and Lesagel, Louis (2016), \\"The Huron- Wendat and the St. Lawrence Iroquoians: New Findings of a Close Relationship,\\" Ontario Archaeology, p. 137, They were likely destroyed by the Mohawk from central New York, who were competing for control of hunting grounds and the fur trade. Hale made many valuable contributions to the science of ethnology, attracting attention particularly by his theory of the origin of the diversities of human languages and dialects. This was inspired by his study of child languages, or the languages invented by young children. He also emphasized the importance of languages as tests of mental capacity, and demonstrated that Native American languages were complex and had a high capacity for classification. He used language as a criterion for the classification of human groups. He was the first to discover that the Tutelo language of Virginia belonged to the Siouan family, which was more commonly associated with the Dakotan and Hidatsa languages and tribes located to the west of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River. He was also the first to identify the Cherokee language as a member of the Iroquoian family of languages. By the colonial and federal period, the Cherokee people were primarily located in the southern interior of present-day Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Most of their members were among the Southeastern tribes forced during Indian Removal of the 1830s to relocate to territory west of the Mississippi River, in what was reserved for a time as Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma). Besides writing numerous magazine articles, Hale read a number of valuable papers before learned societies. These include: * Hiawatha and the Iroquois Confederacy (1881) (available at Project Gutenberg) * Indian Migrations as Evidenced by Language (1882) * The Origin of Languages and the Antiquity of Speaking Man (1886) * The Development of Language (1888) * Language as a Test of Mental Capacity: Being an Attempt to Demonstrate the True Basis of Anthropology (1891)  Bibliography    * Brinton, D.

Beyond Freedom and Dignity is a 1971 book by American psychologist B. F. Skinner. Skinner argues that entrenched belief in free will and the moral autonomy of the individual (which Skinner referred to as \\"dignity\\") hinders the prospect of using scientific methods to modify behavior for the purpose of building a happier and better-organized society. Beyond Freedom and Dignity may be summarized as an attempt to promote Skinner's philosophy of science, the technology of human behavior, his conception of determinism, and what Skinner calls \\"cultural engineering\\". Synopsis The book is organized into nine chapters. A Technology of Behavior In this chapter Skinner proposes that a technology of behavior is possible and that it can be used to help solve currently pressing human issues such as over- population and warfare. \\"Almost all major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of human behavior.\\"Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. page 24 Hardback edition Freedom In this chapter Skinner offers a more precise definition of freedom, one that allows for his conception of determinism, and speaks to the conventional notion of freedom. Skinner argues against \\"autonomous man\\".Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.26 Skinner notes that the forces of Freedom and Dignity have led to many positive advances in the human condition, but may now be hindering the advance of a technology of human behavior: \\"[the literature of freedom and dignity] has been successful in reducing the aversive stimuli used in intentional control, but it has made the mistake of defining freedom in terms of states of mind or feelings...\\"Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.42 Dignity Dignity is the process by which people are given credit for their actions,Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity, p. 58 \\"We recognise a person's dignity or worth when we give him credit for what he has done\\" or alternatively punished for them under the notion of responsibility. Skinner's analysis rejects both as \\"dignity\\" - a false notion of inner causality which removes both credit for action and blame for misdeeds, \\"the achievements for which a person himself is to be given credit seem to approach zero.\\".Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.44 Skinner notes that credit is typically a function of the conspicuousness of control. We give less or no credit, or blame, to those who are overtly coached, compelled, prompted or otherwise not appearing to be producing actions spontaneously. Punishment Skinner saw punishment as the logical consequence of an unscientific analysis of behavior as well as the tradition of \\"freedom and dignity\\". Since individuals are seen to be making choices they are then able to be punished for those choices. Since Skinner denies the existence of free will, he therefore argued against punishment which he saw to be ineffective in controlling behavior. Alternatives to Punishment Skinner notes that the previous solutions to punishment are often not very useful and may create additional problems. Permissiveness, the metaphor of mid-wifery (or maieutics), \\"guidance\\", a dependence on things, \\"changing minds\\", all contain either problems or faulty assumptions about what is going on.\\"The fundamental mistake made by all those who choose weak methods of control is to assume that the balance of control is left to the individual, when in fact it is left to other conditions.\\" p.99 - Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity Skinner argues that this misunderstanding of control championed by the defenders of freedom and dignity \\"encourage[s] the misuse of controlling practices and block progress towards a more effective technology of behavior.\\"Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.100 Values Skinner notes a 'prescientific' view of man allows for personal achievement. The 'scientific view' moves human action to be explained by species evolution and environmental history.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.101 Skinner speaks to feelings about what is right, as well as popular notions of \\"good\\". Skinner translates popular words and phrases around value issues into his view of contingencies of reinforcement. Skinner notes that even if the technology of behavior produces \\"goods\\" to improve human life, they expose environmental control, which is offensive to the \\"freedom and dignity\\" perspective.\\"A technology of behavior is available...but the defenders of freedom oppose its use.\\" Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity p. 125 The Evolution of a Culture Skinner suggests that cultural evolution is a way to describe the aggregate of (operant) behavior. A culture is a collection of behavior, or practices.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.131 Skinner addresses \\"social Darwinism\\" and argues that as a justification of the subordination of other nations or of war competition with others is a small part of natural selection. A much more important part is competition with the physical environment itself.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.133 Skinner relates the idea of cultural evolution back to the question of values: whose values are to survive? The Design of a Culture Skinner notes that cultural design is not new, but is already existing and on-going.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. . 145 Skinner notes that most discussions of current problems are dominated by metaphors, concerns for feelings and states of mind which do not illuminate possible solutions.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.148 Skinner notes that behavior modification is ethically neutral p.150 \\"Such a technology is ethically neutral. It can be used by villain or saint.\\" Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner notes that Utopian speculations, like his novel Walden Two are a kind of cultural engineering.Although Skinner mentions Plato, Augustine and was presumably inspired by Bacon's Atlantic and does not explicitly mention Walden Two in this reference. p.153 Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. He then devotes much of the rest of this chapter to addressing the criticisms and complaints against cultural engineering. What is Man? Skinner again addresses the notion of the individual, and discusses how aspects of a person's character could be assigned to environmental factors.Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.186 aggression, industry, attention are addressed specifically He also covers cognition, problem solving, self-control and counters some arguments or possible misconceptions. Skinner notes that his analysis does not \\"leave an empty organism\\".\\"A great deal goes on inside the organism\\" Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p195 Skinner addresses the issue of mechanical models of human action, which are better addressed elsewhere.Mecca Chiesa's Radical Behaviorism deals with the misunderstanding of Skinner's analysis as \\"mechanistic\\" in some detail Skinner notes that, \\"The evolution of a culture is a gigantic effort in self- control.\\" and ends with, \\"A scientific view of man offers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man.\\" Walden Two Beyond Freedom and Dignity is consistent with Walden Two, a 1948 novel by Skinner, depicting a utopian community based on his ideas regarding behavior modification. In Beyond Freedom and Dignity Skinner extends his argument for explicit cultural engineering of which Walden Two may be seen as an example. Criticisms Linguist Noam Chomsky criticized Skinner's methods and conclusions. Chomsky's 1971 essay \\"The Case Against B.F. Skinner\\" responded to Beyond Freedom and Dignity, arguing against behaviorism and its claim to scientific status.Chomsky, N. The Case Against B.F.Skinner http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19711230.htm In response to Skinner's denial of human dignity, Chomsky said, \\"It would be absurd to conclude merely from the fact that freedom is limited, that ‚Äúautonomous man‚Äù is an illusion (...) It would be hard to conceive of a more striking failure to comprehend even the rudiments of scientific thinking \\".Noam Chomsky, The case against B.F.

John Staddon criticized Skinner's contention that punishment is ineffective and free-will an unnecessary concept, arguing that \\"Punishment doesn't always abolish freedom -- and freedom is not just absence of punishment\\".Staddon, J.

It is also played by the RPI Pep Band at Hockey games (when it is traditional to stand and sing along while the band is playing). It was written in 1897 by Edmund Fales, and was published in the first book of Songs of Rensselaer, printed in 1913. Lyrics :Here's to old RPI, her fame may never die. :Here's to old Rensselaer, she stands today without a peer. :Here's to those olden days, :Here's to those golden days, :Here's to the friends we made at dear old RPI.

Although the Rensselyrics are an a cappella group, this song is accompanied by piano. Each verse or section has a different musical style, several of which are closely based on Billy Joel songs or other popular music. As many facets of life at RPI have changed over the years, the lyrics have changed appropriately.

Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer \\"Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer\\" used to be the fight song during the 1960s. It is still played today by the RPI Pep Band at athletic events. At some point someone updated the words of the fight song to make it more politically correct than it was back in the 60's. Where it now says \\"We all must do our part\\" used to be \\"Each man must do his part\\" and the line \\"True to old Rensselaer.\\" used to be \\"True sons of Rensselaer.\\" Lyrics Words and Music by Charles S. Root '34 :Hail, dear old Rensselaer, the college of our heart. :For dear old Rensselaer, we all must do our part. :True to old Rensselaer, we'll always strive to be. :Now, dear old Rensselaer, hail to thee. :Hear the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet. :Hear the rat-tat-tat of drums that beat. :Hear the voices ringing loud and sweet. :Hear that mighty shout of ... :Hail, dear old Rensselaer, the college of our heart. :For dear old Rensselaer, we all must do our part. :True to old Rensselaer, we'll always strive to be. :Now, dear old Rensselaer, hail to thee. Can You Spell Rensselaer? Throughout the school's history, incoming students and non-students experience difficulty with the spelling and pronunciation of \\"Rensselaer\\". While the local population of those native to Troy, New York colloquially use two syllables when saying the name (e.g., \\"ren'-slur\\"), the student population always uses three (e.g., \\"ren'-suh- leer\\"). This song, with words and music by E.M. Frost, 1911, aims to simplify the art of spelling the name. Lyrics :Can you spell Rensselaer? R-E-N- S-S :If not, you're no Engineer.

Langley Green is in the north-west of the town and is bordered by Manor Royal to the east, Northgate to the south east, West Green to the south across the ring road and Ifield to the west. The main streets running through the community are Stagelands, Martyrs Avenue and Langley Drive. Many of the streets are named after trees and plants (Honeysuckle Lane, Hawthorn Close) animals (Hare Lane, Fox Close) or birds (Jackdaw Close, Swallow Road, Raven Lane). A small shopping parade, St Leonards Church, The Dr. Johnson Pub and Langley Green Primary School formed the centre of the community. History 20th century Work started on Langley Green in the early 1950s with workers being brought down from London by train and living in huts on site. After nine months workers were entitled to a council house, and many of the early population of Langley Green were builders by profession. As Langley Green was within walking distance of the new factory estate, many of the factory workers brought down from London with firms such as APV settled here. Houses in Langley Green ranged from two to four bedrooms, with a small number of flats and bungalows. Heating was by coal, with the coal being stored under the staircase. In some houses water was also heated by solid fuel burners. Many of Langley Green's residents became private house holders in the 1980s when the Margaret Thatcher government had a policy of selling council houses to tenants. Over the years virtually every house on the estate had been improved. The addition of central heating has been almost universal. Other common improvements include double glazing, insulation of walls and roofs and removal of walls and doors to create bigger rooms. Today Today the small neighbourhood is one of the most multi cultural in Crawley and has a lively and friendly community. There were few ethnic-minority families living in Langley Green before the late 1960s. The first families tended to buy their own property and as these were limited at the time, the new immigrants concentrated in areas around Denchers Plat and Beckett Lane.

Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton (the first original Bond novel not to be published by Jonathan Cape) and in the United States by Putnam. Plot summary After being connected to the death of a woman in London, Bond is called in by M to aid the investigation. Returning from Hereford, Special Air Service Sergeant Pearlman tags along by driving Bond back, during which they are attacked and involved in a high-speed chase on an English motorway. Upon safely returning to headquarters, Bond is briefed on the investigation by M and Chief Superintendent Bailey. The woman, whom Bond does not know, was found dead with Bond's telephone number. She is a member of a cult society known as \\"The Meek Ones\\", operated by a Father Valentine. With additional information from the CIA, the British Secret Service learn that Valentine is an alias for Vladimir Scorpius, an arms dealer for several terrorist organisations. As the country's general election approaches, by the use of brainwashed cult members, Scorpius has begun a \\"holy war\\" against every man, woman, and child. The cult members, thinking themselves to be pure, moral, and unsullied, sacrifice their lives for \\"the greater good of humanity\\" believing that by performing this \\"death task\\" that they will achieve paradise. Throughout the novel, The Meek Ones commit several acts of terrorism, including bombings and assassinations of British politicians. Throughout the horror, Bond meets Harriett Horner, an IRS agent working undercover in England and investigating a credit card company run by Scorpius. The two work together along with Pearlman to attempt to track down Scorpius. After an interrogation of a captured cult member, Horner is taken captive by Scorpius' men. Additionally, Pearlman confesses to Bond that he was secretly giving Scorpius information for the benefit of his daughter who had been brainwashed. Together the two set out for Scorpius' base of operations in South Carolina, having Scorpius believe Pearlman was taking Bond captive. At Scorpius' island, Bond meets up with Horner once again and the two actually marry at the behest of Scorpius. Knowing that the marriage is invalid, Bond agrees to go ahead with it thinking it would buy him time until he can escape. On the night the two decide to escape, Harriett is killed by a water moccasin. At the same time the FBI is conducting a raid of Scorpius' island, which further angers Bond since her death was in vain. Bond returns to the island, finding Scorpius attempting to flee. After giving chase, Bond successfully gets the upper hand and forces Scorpius to die in a similar manner to that of Horner.

Pearlman drives Bond back and in doing so earns Bond's trust. Bond later learns, however, that Pearlman was secretly feeding Scorpius information because his daughter was brainwashed and a member of The Meek Ones. He confesses this much to Bond and requests help in getting his daughter free from the society. Unfortunately for Pearlman, when the opportunity arises, his daughter is sent on a \\"death task\\" to kill both the President of the United States and the British prime minister. She is unsuccessful and subsequently killed by Bond before she can detonate her explosives. * Chief Superintendent Bailey: Bailey is sent by Special Branch to aid in the investigation of the terrorist activities in England.

School of Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger Sir Henry Savile (30 November 154919 February 1622) was an English scholar and mathematician, Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton. He endowed the Savilian chairs of Astronomy and of Geometry at Oxford University, and was one of the scholars who translated the New Testament from Greek into English. He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Bossiney in Cornwall in 1589, and Dunwich in Suffolk in 1593. Life He was the son of Henry Savile of Over Bradley, Stainland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, a member of an old county family, the Saviles of Methley, and of his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Ramsden. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1561. He then became a Fellow of Merton College in 1565. He established a reputation as a Greek scholar and mathematician by voluntary lectures on Ptolemy's Almagest, and in 1575 became Junior Proctor of the university. In 1578 he travelled on the continent of Europe, where he collected manuscripts, and is said to have been employed by Queen Elizabeth as her resident in the Low Countries. On his return he was named Greek tutor to the Queen. In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Savile, with John Chamber and Thomas Digges, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by John Dee.Adam Mosley, 'Chamber, John (1546‚Äì1604), in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) In 1585 he was established as Warden of Merton by a vigorous exercise of the interest of Burghley and Secretary Walsingham. He proved a successful and autocratic head of house, generally unpopular with Fellows and undergraduates, but under him the college flourished. His translation of four books of the Histories of Tacitus, with the learned Commentary on Roman Warfare (1591), enhanced his reputation. He also sat in Parliament as one of the two members for Bossiney in 1589 and for Dunwich (both were notorious rotten boroughs) in 1593. On 26 May 1596 he obtained the provostship of Eton College, the reward of persistent begging. He was not qualified for the post under the statutes of the college, for he was not in holy orders, and the Queen was reluctant to name him. Savile insisted with considerable ingenuity that the Queen had a right to dispense with statutes, and at last he got his way. In February 1601 he was put under arrest on suspicion of having been concerned in the rebellion of the Earl of Essex. He was soon released, and his friendship with the faction of Essex went far to gain him the favour of James I. So no doubt did the views he had maintained in regard to the statutes of Eton. It may have been to his advantage that his elder brother, Sir John Savile (1545‚Äì1607), was a high prerogative lawyer and one of the barons of the exchequer, who in 1606 affirmed the right of the King to impose import and export duties on his own authority. On 30 September 1604 Savile was knighted, and in that year he was named one of the body of scholars appointed to prepare the Authorised Version of the Bible. He was entrusted with parts of the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation. In 1619 he founded and endowed a chair in astronomy and a chair in geometry at Oxford, both bearing his name. He died at Eton on 19 February 1622, and is buried there. A fine mural monument to him in Merton College Chapel offers views of contemporary Merton and Eton and references to his literary achievements (notably Chrysostom). Sir Henry Savile has sometimes been confounded with another Henry Savile, called Long Harry (1570‚Äì1617), who gave currency to the forged addition to the Chronicle of Asser which contains the story that King Alfred founded the University of Oxford. Works Title page of Savile's introductory lectures on Euclid's Elements, Praelectiones tresdecim in principium elementorum Euclidis (1621) In 1596 Savile produced the first printed edition of the first four books of the Gesta Pontificum Anglorum ‚Äì an ecclesiastical history of England written by William of Malmesbury in the early 12th century. Savile used Cambridge University Library MS Ff.1.25.1 as his source for this, which was a copy of a copy of the original manuscript. His edition of the works of St. John Chrysostom in eight folio volumes was published in 1610‚Äì1613. It was printed by the king's printer on a private press erected at the expense of Sir Henry, who imported the type. The Chrysostom cost him ¬£8000 and did not sell well. However, it was the most considerable work of pure learning undertaken in England, as it involved consulting French Chrysostomians and the despatching of young researchers to the Imperial Library in Vienna and the Patriarchal Library at Heybeliada or Halki, (then under the Ottoman Empire) and other leading monasteries and/or collections in his time. At the same press he published an edition of the Cyropaedia in 1618. Savile was keen to impart his understanding of mathematics to his students at Oxford, and in founding the Geometry chair he gave thirteen preparatory lectures on the original books of Euclid's Elements in 1620. These were published in 1621 as his Praelectiones tresdecim in principium elementorum Euclidis, Oxonii habitae MCDXX. Oxonii: Excudebant Iohannes Lichfield,John Lichfield was printer to the university of Oxford from 1617 to 1635, and was also yeoman bedell. See Lichfield, Leonard (DNB00) & Iacobus Short, 1621. ('Thirteen introductory lectures on the principal elements of Euclid, considered [or reasoned] at Oxford in 1620'.) It was Savile who first traced the hand of Theon of Alexandria as a commentator on Euclid.

It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam (Valium). In addition to being used to treat anxiety or panic states, bromazepam may be used as a premedicant prior to minor surgery. Bromazepam typically comes in doses of 3 mg and 6 mg tablets. It was patented in 1961 by Roche and approved for medical use in 1974. Medical uses Treatment of severe anxiety. Despite certain side effects and the emergence of alternative products (e.g pregabalin), benzodiazepine medication remains an effective way of reducing problematic symptoms, and is typically deemed effective by patients and medical professionals.https://www.has- sante.fr/upload/docs/evamed/CT-15448_LEXOMIL_PIS_RI_avis2_CT15448.pdf Similarly to other intermediate-acting depressants, it may be used as hypnotic medication or in order to mitigate withdrawal effects of alcohol consumption.http://agence- prd.ansm.sante.fr/php/ecodex/frames.php?specid=67851467&typedoc;=R&ref;=R0157296.htm Pharmacology 50 Pills of Lexotanil (containing 6 mg of Bromezepam apiece) as sold by Hoffmann-La Roche in Germany Bromazepam is a \\"classical\\" benzodiazepine; other classical benzodiazepines include: diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam, flurazepam, and clorazepate. Its molecular structure is composed of a diazepine connected to a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, the benzene ring having a single nitrogen atom that replaces one of the carbon atoms in the ring structure.Bromazepam Eutimia.com - Salud Mental. ¬© 1999-2002. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepine, which means that the nitrogens on the seven-sided diazepine ring are in the 1 and 4 positions. Bromazepam binds to the GABA receptor GABAA, causing a conformational change and increasing the inhibitory effects of GABA. It acts as a positive modulator, increasing the receptors' response when activated by GABA itself or an agonist (such as alcohol). As opposed to barbital, BZDs are not GABA-receptor activators and rely on increasing the neurotransmitter's natural activity. Bromazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, is moderately lipophilic compared to other substances of its class and metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. It does not possess any antidepressant or antipsychotic qualities. After night time administration of bromazepam a highly significant reduction of gastric acid secretion occurs during sleep followed by a highly significant rebound in gastric acid production the following day. Bromazepam alters the electrical status of the brain causing an increase in beta activity and a decrease in alpha activity in EEG recordings. Pharmacokinetics Bromazepam is reported to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since itraconazole, a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at the Solvay Pharmaceutical Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism. The major metabolite of bromazepam is hydroxybromazepam, which is an active agent too and has a half- life approximately equal to that of bromazepam. Side-effects Bromazepam is similar in side effects to other benzodiazepines. The most common side effects reported are drowsiness, sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and dizziness. Impairments to memory functions are common with bromazepam and include a reduced working memory and reduced ability to process environmental information. A 1975 experiment on healthy, male college students exploring the effects of four different drugs on learning capacity observed that taking bromazepam alone at 6 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks impaired learning capacities significantly. In combination with alcohol, impairments in learning capacity became even more pronounced. Various studies report impaired memory, visual information processing and sensory data and impaired psychomotor performance; deterioration of cognition including attention capacity and impaired co-ordinative skills; impaired reactive and attention performance, which can impair driving skills; drowsiness and decrease in libido. Unsteadiness after taking bromazepam is, however, less pronounced than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme alterations in memory such as anterograde amnesia and amnesic automatism, which may have medico-legal consequences. Such reactions occur usually only at the higher dose end of the prescribing spectrum. Very rarely, dystonia can develop. Up to 30% treated on a long-term basis develop a form of dependence, i.e. these patients cannot stop the medication without experiencing physical and/or psychological benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Leukopenia and liver-damage of the cholestatic type with or without jaundice (icterus) have additionally been seen; the original manufacturer Roche recommends regular laboratory examinations to be performed routinely. Ambulatory patients should be warned that bromazepam may impair the ability to drive vehicles and to operate machinery. The impairment is worsened by consumption of alcohol, because both act as central nervous system depressants. During the course of therapy, tolerance to the sedative effect usually develops. Frequency and seriousness of adverse effects As with all medication, the frequency and seriousness of side-effects varies greatly depending on quantities consumed. In a study about bromazepam's negative effects on psychomotor skills and driving ability, it was noted that 3 mg doses caused minimal impairment. It also appeared that impairment may be tied to methods of testing more so than on the product's intrinsic activity. Moreover, side-effects other than drowsiness, dizziness and ataxia seem to be rare and not experienced by more than a few percent of users. The use of other, comparable medication seems to display an identically moderate side- effect profile''. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal Prolonged use of bromazepam can cause tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug, and as a result, it is a medication which is controlled by international law. It is nonetheless important to note that dependence, long-term use and misuse occur in a minority of cases and are not representative of most patients' experience with this type of medicationhttp://www.dickyricky.com/Medicine/Papers/2017_03_23%20NEJM%20Treatment%20of%20Benzodiazepine%20Dependence.pdf'. It shares with other benzodiazepines the risk of abuse, misuse, psychological dependence or physical dependence. A withdrawal study demonstrated both psychological dependence and physical dependence on bromazepam including marked rebound anxiety after 4 weeks chronic use. Those whose dose was gradually reduced experienced no withdrawal. Patients treated with bromazepam for generalised anxiety disorder were found to experience withdrawal symptoms such as a worsening of anxiety, as well as the development of physical withdrawal symptoms when abruptly withdrawn bromazepam. Abrupt or over rapid withdrawal from bromazepam after chronic use even at therapeutic prescribed doses can lead to a severe withdrawal syndrome including status epilepticus and a condition resembling delerium tremens. Animal studies have shown that chronic administration of diazepam (or bromazepam) causes a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased turnover of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin, increased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased levels of the catecholamines. During withdrawal of bromazepam or diazepam a fall in tryptophan, serotonin levels occurs as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Changes in the levels of these chemicals in the brain can cause headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. Overdose Bromazepam is commonly involved in drug overdoses. A severe bromazepam benzodiazepine overdose may result in an alpha pattern coma type. The toxicity of bromazepam in overdosage increases when combined with other CNS depressant drugs such as alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs. Similarly to other benzodiazepines however, being a positive modulator of certain neuroreceptors and not an agonist, the product has reduced overdose potential compared to older products of the barbiturate class. Its consumption alone is very seldom fatal in healthy adults. Bromazepam was in 2005 the most common benzodiazepine involved in intentional overdoses in France. Bromazepam has also been responsible for accidental poisonings in companion animals. A review of benzodiazepine poisonings in cats and dogs from 1991-1994 found bromazepam to be responsible for significantly more poisonings than any other benzodiazepine. Contraindications Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in elderly, pregnant, child, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Special populations *Globally, bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children. *In 1987, a team of scientists led by Ochs reported that the elimination half-life, peak serum concentration, and serum free fraction are significantly elevated and the oral clearance and volume of distribution significantly lowered in elderly subjects. The clinical consequence is that the elderly should be treated with lower doses than younger patients. *Bromazepam may affect driving and ability to operate machinery. *Bromazepam is pregnancy category D, a classification that means that bromazepam has been shown to cause harm to the unborn child. The Hoffman LaRoche product information leaflet warns against breast feeding while taking bromazepam. There has been at least one report of sudden infant death syndrome linked to breast feeding while consuming bromazepam. Interactions Cimetidine, fluvoxamine and propranolol causes a marked increase in the elimination half-life of bromazepam leading to increased accumulation of bromazepam. Society and culture Drug misuse Bromazepam has a similar misuse risk as other benzodiazepines such as diazepam. In France car accidents involving psychotropic drugs in combination with alcohol (itself a major contributor) found benzodiazepines, mainly diazepam, nordiazepam, and bromazepam, to be the most common drug present in the blood stream, almost twice that of the next-most-common drug cannabis. Bromazepam has also been used in serious criminal offences including robbery, homicide, and sexual assault. Brand names It is marketed under several brand names, including Lectopam, Lexomil, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium, Lexatin, Calmepam and Lexotanil.

His birthplace is probably indicated by his surname, Devizes in Wiltshire, but of his life we know nothing. He is credited by Bale with the composition of the Annales de Wintonia, which are edited by Henry Richards Luard in the second volume of the Annales Monastici. If this statement be correct, then the chronicler survived King Richard I of England. In his account of the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189 he was the first person to use the word holocaust when he described the mass murder of the Jews of London, although the use of this word simply refers to a \\" whole (holos) burnt (kaustos)\\" sacrificial offering to a god. :Now in the year of our Lord's incarnation 1189, Richard, the son of King Henry the Second, by Eleanor, and brother of Henry the Third, was consecrated king of the English by Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster, in the nones of the third of September. On the very day of the coronation, about that solemn hour in which the Son was immolated to the Father, a sacrifice of the Jews to their father, the Devil, was commenced in the city of London, and so long was the duration of this famous mystery that the holocaust could scarcely be accomplished the ensuing day. The other cities and towns of the kingdom emulated the faith of the Londoners, and with a like devotion dispatched their bloodsuckers with blood to hell. Chronicon The Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi (1192), by which Richard of Devizes is chiefly known, covers only the first three years of King Richard's reign; it is practically an account of events in England and the Holy Land during the Third Crusade. The narrator of the chronicle is a French Jewish cobbler giving advice to young French Christians intending to visit England. For the events of the crusade itself, some consider Richard to be poor authority. But his account of the preparations for the crusade, and of English affairs in the king's absence, is valuable, in spite of some possible inaccuracies. A new reading has emerged recently of the Chronicle mostly due to the inordinate number of classical and biblical references it is laced with (see Anthony P. Bale's article, cited below). Rather than a true historic record, Devizes' account is now being read as an elegant satire and a challenge of contemporary Christian myths against the Jewish community and its mores; particularly those of ritualistic murders of Christian boys by the Jews of Winchester. It is however by no means a defence of the Jewish community. Others have seen the author as intensely conservative, steeped in the prejudices of his order, and can be seen as being hostile to the Jews and to the chancellor, William Longchamp. Devizes writes in a vivid and epigrammatic style; his Latin shows the effect of the 12th- century Renaissance in its polish and in its reminiscences of classical poets. He describes King John as a raging madman who \\"emitted foam from his mouth\\". The editions of the Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi are:  by R. Howlett in Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I, vol. iii. (Rolls Series, 1886); * the Annales de Wintonia in HR Luard's Annales Monastici, vol. ii.

Chenopodium bonus-henricus), also called Good- King-Henry, poor-man's asparagus, perennial goosefoot, Lincolnshire spinach, Markery,Great British Bites: Lincolnshire spinach Times Online, 13 May 2008 English mercury, or mercury goosefoot, is a species of goosefoot which is native to much of central and southern Europe. Good-King-Henry has been grown as a vegetable in cottage gardens for hundreds of years, although this dual- purpose vegetable is now rarely grown and the species is more often considered a weed. Description It is an annual or perennial plant growing up to 400‚Äì800 mm tall. The leaves are 50‚Äì100 mm long and broad, triangular to diamond-shaped, with a pair of broad pointed lobes near the base, with a slightly waxy, succulent texture. The flowers are produced in a tall, nearly leafless spike 100‚Äì300 mm long; each flower is very small (3‚Äì5 mm diameter), green, with five sepals. The seeds are reddish-green, 2‚Äì3 mm diameter. Taxonomy The species was described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus as Chenopodium bonus-henricus in Species Plantarum. Until 2012, the species was usually included in genus Chenopodium, but molecular genetical research revealed that it does not really belong to this genus. It seems to be more closely related to the genus Spinacia, and is now placed in the genus Blitum in the tribe Anserineae. The scientific name Blitum bonus-henricus was first used by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1832. Synonyms basing on the same type specimen are: Agathophytum bonus-henricus (L.) Moq., Anserina bonus-henricus (L.) Dumort., Atriplex bonus-henricus (L.) Crantz, Chenopodium bonus-henricus L., Orthospermum bonus-henricus (L.) Schur, and Orthosporum bonus-henricus (L.) T. Nees. Heterotypic synonyms are: Blitum perenne Bubani, Chenopodium hastatum St.-Lag., Chenopodium ruderale Kit. ex Moq., Chenopodium ruderale St.-Lag., Chenopodium sagittatum Lam., Chenopodium spinacifolium Stokes, Chenopodium triangulare Dulac, Chenopodium triangularifolia Gilib., and Orthosporum unctuosum Montandon. Cultivation and uses It should be planted in a fertile, sunny location which is free from perennial weeds. Seeds must be cold-stratified in order to germinate. The plants should be regularly weeded and well watered. Typically, very little is produced in the first season. Good King Henry does not respond well to transplantation. The foliage can be cut in autumn, and a mulch, such as leaf mould or well-rotted compost applied to the plot. Culinary uses Cropping can begin in spring. Some of the new shoots can be thinned out as they appear (usually from mid spring to early summer) and cooked like asparagus. All cutting should then cease so that shoots are allowed to develop. The succulent triangular leaves may be harvested a few at a time until the end of August and cooked like spinach.

Its rhizome is a root vegetable that can be eaten raw, pickled, dried or cooked.T.K. Lim, Edible Medicinal and Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 11, Modifi ed Stems, Roots, Bulbs, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-26062-4_3  Description  Tubers of S. affinis S. affinis is a perennial herbaceous plant with red to purple flowers and reaches a height of 30 ‚Äì 120 cm. The green leaves are opposite arranged on the stem. The rough, nettle-like leaves can be ovate-cordate shaped with a width of 2.5 ‚Äì 9.5 cm or ovate-oblong with a width of 1.5 ‚Äì 3.5 cm. The leaves are separated into a leaf blade and a petiole. The petiole has a length of 1 ‚Äì 2 cm and becomes shorter towards the stem apex. Similar to the potato, S. affinis grows rhyzomes which are approximately 8 cm long and 2 cm thick. By medullary primary growth they thicken primarily on the internodes and less on the nodes. This way at irregular intervals constricted tubers are formed, which are usually thinner on both ends. The tubers are coby covered with a thin, pale- beige-to-ivory skin. The flesh underneath is white and tender.  Compounds  Vacuoles in the tuber of S. affinis are rich in stachyose. Stachyose is a tetrasaccharide, consist out of galactose, glucose and fructose. Stachyose is up to 80-90% in dry tubers.  Origin and history  S. affinis originates from central and northern China. Before S. affinis had been domesticated, a related crop named S. palustris was collected in nature to be consumed as a vegetable. Later on the Germanic peoples used S. recta, which is a further relative of S. affinis, as medicinal plant. The plant was then cultivated from the 18th century onwards. In 1882 the crop was cultivated on a farm for the first time in Crosne. S. affinis is the only labiate which is cultivated as vegetable in Europe. At the beginning of the 20th century S. affinis became more and more popular until it was abandoned again in the 1970‚Äôs due to problems with viruses and the plants strong vagility. Since 1990 there has been a rise in the cultivation of S. affinis again and it is available in some markets and in some grocery shops. Today the plant is listed in the ‚ÄúHandbook of Alien Species in Europe‚Äù as invasive plant in Europe.  Taxonomy  The plant is part of the family Lamiaceae. A later described species, named S. sieboldii, in dedication to the German-Dutch botanist and japanologist Philipp Franz von Siebold, is considered to be a synonym.  Cultivation  S. affinis is planted as a bulb (vegetative) in spring (March - May). Multiple bulbs are planted 5 to 8 cm deep into a hole of dimensions 30 cm by 30 cm. The plant is achieving a height of 30 cm. Weeding is necessary but it is important not to damage the root system. A sufficient water supply during summer is important. Harvest is from November to March. It is important that the soil is not frozen when harvesting. The storage of S. affinis tubers is difficult. Because of their thin skin, they can be stored only for a few days, about a week in a fridge. An alternative can be a fresh ongoing harvesting out of humid sand, thereby the tubers stay fresh for several months.  Usage   Culinary  The tubers have a crunchy texture and a sweet, nutty flavour. They can be eaten raw, pickled, dried or cooked. A wide range of uses for this vegetable leads to various dishes in many countries‚Äô kitchen. They can be prepared similarly to Jerusalem artichokes. The leaves can be dried and made into a tea. In Chinese and Japanese cuisine, the S. affinis is primarily pickled. In particular, its tuber is a part of Osechi, cooked for celebrating Japanese New Year. Dyed red by leaves of red shiso after being pickled, it is called chorogi. In Korea it is called choseokjam (Ï¥àÏÑùÏû†). In French cuisine, its cooked tuber is often served alongside dishes named japonaise or Japanese-styled.  Medicinal  In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the entirety of S. affinis is used as an agent to treat colds and pneumonia. In addition, root extract of S. affinis has showed antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, Baek et al. observe antioxidant activity in 2004. Also in 2004 inhibitory effects on acetylcholine esterase, monoamine oxidase and xanthine oxidase activities were observed in rat brains after 20 days feeding with methanolic extracts of S. affinis. Ethanol extract from this plant also seems to have antitumour activity.

He was a cultural critic in the tradition of Matthew Arnold and a consistent opponent of romanticism, as represented by the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Politically he can, without serious distortion, be called a follower of Aristotle and Edmund Burke. He was an advocate of classical humanism but also offered an ecumenical defense of religion. His humanism implied a broad knowledge of various moral and religious traditions. His book Democracy and Leadership (1924), is regarded as a classic text of political conservatism. Babbitt is regarded as a major influence over American cultural and political conservatism.Robert Muccigrosso, ed., Research Guide to American Historical Biography (1988) 1:80- 85 Early career Babbitt was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Augusta (Darling) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt. He moved with his family over much of the USA while a young child. He was brought up from age 11 in Madisonville, a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. He entered Harvard College in 1885. On graduation in 1889 he took a post teaching classics at the College of Montana. After two years, he went to study in France, at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes-√©tudes linked to the Sorbonne. There he studied Pali literature and Buddhism, for a year. Then he took a master's degree at Harvard, including Sanskrit. Harvard At this point, he moved away from a career as a classical scholar, taking a teaching position at Williams College in romance languages -- just for one year, as it turned out. He then was offered in 1894 an instructor's position, again at Harvard, in French. He was to stay at Harvard, rising from the ranks to become a full professor of French literature in 1912. He is credited with introducing the study of comparative literature there. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. The position of Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature was endowed by Harvard University in 1960. The National Humanities Institute runs an Irving Babbitt Project. New Humanism It was in the early 1890s that he first allied himself with Paul Elmer More in developing the core doctrines that were to constitute what he called the \\"New Humanism\\". In 1895 he gave a lecture What is Humanism?, which announced his attack on Rousseau. At the time, Babbitt had switched out of classical studies. He would later declare his opposition to contemporary textual and philological scholarship, associated with German scholarship, as a finite task, which he was unhappy to see placed above teaching based on what he felt was the \\"eternal\\" moral and spiritual content of literary masterpieces. His ideas, and More's, were characteristically written as short pieces or essays that were later gathered into books. Babbitt's Literature and the American College, although assembled from writings already circulated, caused a stir when published in 1908. He continued to publish in the same vein, often denouncing authors from his avowed specialty, French literature. He also criticized Francis Bacon and denounced literary naturalism and utilitarianism. His central emphasis was on the individual moral character and human reason. He put stress on self- discipline and the need to control impulses seeking liberation from all restraints. He opposed naturalism on the grounds that it emphasizes the dominance of external natural forces over the strength of character and individual conscience.Robert Muccigrosso ed., Research Guide to American Historical Biography (1988) 1:80- 85 He denounced romanticism; and especially its chief propagator, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He warned that Rousseau was the chief negative influence over modern culture. He opposed overt sentimentalism, celebration of human perfection and utopian thinking of romanticism. His views were in the tradition of classical pre-romantic literature. Democracy and Leadership In 1924, Babbitt published, which is perhaps his best-known work; Democracy and Leadership. The book deals with his political views from his humanistic outlook. In it, he discussed and criticized political theories which derives from naturalism. Babbitt criticized two sides of naturalistic thoughtmechanistic or utilitarian side, propagated by Francis Bacon and the sentimental side, represented by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Babbitt attacked both for giving too much importance to forces of nature and unrestrained human passion and impulses; while ignoring the fundamental importance of individual conscience and moral character. He rejected historical deterministic theories from Saint Augustine to Bossuet. He stated high moral character as the most important quality of leadership in a democratic society. He warned against the dangers of unchecked majoritarianism in democracies. Babbitt's political views are in the tradition of classical liberalism, from Aristotle and Edmund Burke. His book is considered as a classic conservative political work. Conservative scholars like Russell Kirk were influenced by Babbitt. Kirk praised the book as \\"...one of the few truly important works of political thought.\\" His political views originated from his belief in the supreme importance of moral character. He rejected socio-political activism and sentimentalism as no substitute for individual conscience and character. He put stress on individual responsibility and opposed \\"everybody's interference in everybody else's business.\\" Criticism, influence and legacy He met with increasing criticism down the years: those provoked into announcing their opposition included R. P. Blackmur, Oscar Cargill, Ernest Hemingway, Harold Laski, Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Joel Elias Spingarn, Allen Tate, and Edmund Wilson. In the case of Mencken, at least, Babbitt gave as good as he got; he branded Mencken's writing as \\"intellectual vaudeville\\", a criticism with which posterity has had some sympathy. He had an early influence on T. S. Eliot, a student of his at Harvard. Eliot in his 1926 essay The Humanism of Irving Babbitt, a review of Democracy and Leadership, had become equivocal, finding Babbitt's humanism not sufficiently receptive to Christian dogma; his position vis-√†-vis religion is still debated. The identifiable figures of the New Humanist movement, besides Babbitt and More, were mostly influenced by Babbitt on a personal level and included G. R. Elliott (1883-1963), Norman Foerster (1887-1972), Frank Jewett Mather (1868-1953), Robert Shafer (1889-1956) and Stuart Pratt Sherman (1881-1926). Of these, Sherman moved away early, and Foerster, a star figure, later reconsidered and veered towards the New Criticism. More peripherally, Yvor Winters and the Great Books movement are supposed to have taken something from New Humanism. Scholars influenced by Babbitt include Milton Hindus, Russell Kirk, Nathan Pusey, Peter Viereck, Richard M. Weaver, Claes G. Ryn, and George Will. A relationship has been traced between Babbitt and Gordon Keith Chalmers, Walter Lippmann, Louis Mercier, and Austin Warren; however, claims of influence where it is not acknowledged are not easy to sustain, and Babbitt was known to advise against public tributes. From a position of high prominence in the 1920s, having the effective but questionable support of The Bookman, New Humanism experienced a drop from fashionable status after Babbitt died in 1933 and modernist and progressive currents became increasingly dominant in American intellectual, cultural and political life. By the 1940s its enemies pronounced it nearly extinct, but Babbitt continued to exercise a partly hidden influence, and a marked revival of interest was seen in the 1980s and ensuing decades. Babbitt is often name-checked in discussions on cultural conservatism. Babbitt's influence in China, which was notable in the 1930s and 40s, is again on the rise with the publication of many books by or about Babbitt. Personal life Babbitt married Dora May (n√©e Drew) Babbitt on June 12, 1900, with whom he had two children: Esther and Edward Sturges.\\"Babbitt, Irving, 1865-1933.

De Geer is best known for his work on varves. In 1890 De Geer was the first to apply the name Ancylus Lake to the Baltic paleolake discovered by Henrik Munthe. He subsequently participated the protracted scientific controversy surrounding this lake.  Biography  Baron Gerard Jacob De Geer comes from a well-known Swedish aristocratic family of Brabant origin, who had emigrated to Sweden in the early seventeenth century. His family included prominent industrialists and politicians. His father Louis and older brother Gerhard Louis served as the Prime Minister of Sweden. Gerard Jacob was born on October 2, 1858 in Stockholm in the family of Baron Louis Gerhard de Geer, at that time the first Minister of Justice in the Swedish government, and Carolina de Geer, n√©e Countess Wachtmeister. Since 1869 he studied at primary school, and since 1873 - at the Stockholm gymnasium. In 1877, de Geer entered Uppsala University. In May 1879 he graduated and received a bachelor of arts degree. In 1878, De Geer became an employee of the Geological Survey of Sweden, initially freelance, then, since 1882, as an assistant to a geologist, and since 1885, a full-time geologist. At this time he started to study the late Quaternary deposits and landforms of southern Sweden. In 1897, he left his job in the geological service for the position of professor of general and historical geology at Stockholm University. In 1882, on the recommendation of Otto Martin Torell, de Geer participated in the Swedish expedition to Spitsbergen as part of the first International Polar Year as a staff geologist. This marks the beginning of many years of research on the modern glaciation of the Svalbard archipelago: in total he took part in six expeditions to Svalbard (1882, 1896, 1899, 1901, 1908 and 1910). Gerard de Geer remained a lecturer at the Department of Geology at the University of Stockholm from 1897 to 1924. At the university, he served as rector (1902-1910) and vice-chancellor from (1911-1924). In addition, De Geer was a member of the Swedish Parliament from 1900 to 1905. The pinnacle of de Geer's scientific career can be considered the receipt of the presidency of the X International Geological Congress, held in Stockholm in 1910. At first he took part in the preparation of the Congress as vice-chairman of the preparatory committee, and from May 1907 - as chairman of the executive committee. Within the framework of the congress, he delivered the now classic lecture \\"A geochronology of the last 12000 years\\". He began this lecture with such words \\"Geology is the history of the earth, but hitherto it has been a history without years.\\" At the congress De Geer formally introduced the term varve defining it as any annual sedimentary layer, and also proposed that the term geochronology be restricted to varve dating, other existing techniques being less accurate and precise. By then, observations of the stratigraphic relationship between varved sediment and recessional moraines, and the correlation of varve sequences between geographically distant sites, added more compelling evidence to De Geer's essentially circumstantial speculation. The geological community accepted that the couplets were unlikely to represent any period other than the year. In addition, before the start of the Congress, De Geer conducted an excursion for 65 delegates from 14 countries, within the framework of which he examined the Dicksonfjorden on Spitsbergen.  Main research areas  De Geer's early studies of raised beaches, used to reconstruct glacio-isostatic sea level changes, and his mapping of glacial moraines to reconstruct the extent of the last Scandinavian ice sheet and its pattern of deglaciation (the particular type of moraine he studied is now referred to as De Geer moraine), were well received. However, De Geer is most famous for discovering varves and pioneering their use in geochronology. During fieldwork in 1878, De Geer noticed that the appearance of laminated sediments deposited in glacial lakes at the margin of the retreating Scandinavian ice sheet at the end of the last ice age, closely resembled tree-rings. In his best known work Geochronologia Sueccia, published in 1940, De Geer wrote \\"From the obvious similarity with the regular, annual rings of the trees I got at once the impression that both ought to be annual deposits\\" (1940, p. 13). While this observation was not new, De Geer was the first geologist to exploit its potential application. De Geer called these annual sedimentary layers varves and throughout the 1880s further developed his theory, publishing a brief outline of his discovery in 1882, which he followed with a presentation to the Swedish Geological Society in 1884. It was not until 1910, at the International Geological Congress, that De Geer's pioneering work reached the wider international scientific community.  The Swedish Time Scale  In 1897 De Geer was appointed professor of geology at Stockholm University, and went on to become the university's president from 1902-1910. With the help of numerous students from both Stockholm and Uppsala, De Geer began to piece together short, but overlapping, varve sequences in south east Sweden to create a longer year-by- year chronology of glacial retreat for the Lateglacial period. The urban expansion of Stockholm provided perfect conditions for De Geer and his colleagues, who made good use of numerous exposures of laminated sediment in the many pits and cuttings that exposed the glacial lake sediments of the Baltic basin. Estuarine sediments exposed along the valley of the Angermanalven River, allowed De Geer to further extend the chronology into the early Holocene. The resulting varve chronology was called the Swedish Time Scale, and geologists outside Sweden soon followed suit using varved sediments to build high-resolution chronologies of glacial retreat, most notably Matti Sauramo in Finland.  Global expeditions, teleconnections, and controversy  De Geer firmly believed the main control on varve sedimentation was solar radiation acting on glacier meltwater production, and that consequently, varved sediments represented a \\"..gigantic, natural self-registering thermograph\\" (De Geer 1926) and varve curves (varve thickness plotted against varve number or year), which he often referred to as \\"solar curves\\", a reliable proxy for past changes in solar radiation. Ultimately, De Geer hoped his studies of varves would explain the fundamental cause of Ice Ages - \\"If the last glaciation everywhere should show to be synchronous and the origin of the last Ice Age thus to be of a general nature, the assumption of a cosmic cause would scarcely be avoidable.\\" In 1915 De Geer matched, or 'teleconnected\\", varve curves from Sweden to varve curves from Finland and Norway. This first attempt at long-distance correlation marked the start of two decades travelling around the world by De Geer and his colleagues, searching out varve sequences for potential teleconnections. In 1920 De Geer travelled to North America with his wife and two assistants, Ernst Antevs and Ragnar Liden. Antevs remained in North America at the end of the trip, where he worked on the North American varve chronology. Further trips included Erik Norin's visit to the Himalayas (1924‚Äì1925), Erik Nilsson's visit to East Africa (1927‚Äì28), and Carl Caldenius' visit to South America (1925‚Äì1929), and later to New Zealand (1932‚Äì34). However, by the mid-1930s De Geer's teleconnections had become the subject of increasing criticism from his former student Ernst Antevs. Antevs correctly argued that the teleconnections were bad science, and that De Geer's Trans-Atlantic correlations were inaccurate. De Geer felt his position was being caricatured and intentionally misunderstood by Antevs, but did little scientifically to rebuff the criticisms levelled at him. In 1924 De Geer retired from teaching and became the founder-director of the Geochronological Institute at Stockholm University.  Geochronologia Suecica Principles  In 1940, De Geer published his longest and best-known work Geochronologia Suecica Principles, in which he presented part of the Swedish Time Scale in detail, and expounded upon his theories and work regarding varves. Almost immediately after the publication of Geochronologia Suecica Principles De Geer's Swedish Time Scale underwent the first of many revisions, as other geologists became involved in the study of varves and more sites were examined. However, international interest in varves diminished. The bitter dispute between De Geer and Antevs, coupled with the advent of new dating techniques, most importantly radiocarbon dating, showed varves in a bad light. De Geer died in Stockholm on July 24, 1943. His wife, Ebba Hult De Geer, continued to publish his work, and add to it, into the 1950s.  Awards and recognition  De Geer's contributions to geology were recognised in the UK, where the Geological Society awarded De Geer the Wollaston Medal in 1920, and the Royal Society elected De Geer a foreign member in 1930. The ancient DeGeer Sea in modern-day Maritime Canada was named in his honour. The Swedish Antarctic Expedition (1901‚Äì1904) named a glacier on South Georgia Island in the southern Atlantic Ocean after De Geer. The British would later rename the glacier Harker Glacier after a contemporary English geologist, Alfred Harker. The valley of De Geerdalen at Spitsbergen, Svalbard is named after him.  De Geer from a modern perspective  De Geer's most significant contribution to Quaternary science was unquestionably the identification of varves, and his recognition of their potential in establishing annual chronologies of past climatic and environmental change. The Swedish Time Scale was the most precise and accurate geological timescale of its day, and it is still being improved and added to today. His insistence that varves represented quantifiable proxies for past climate has since been borne out to a degree, but the relationship between varve thickness and hydrometeorological conditions is not as simple as he presumed. Varves have recently experienced a renaissance as methods and techniques of study have improved, and varves are now regularly used to calibrate radiocarbon timescales. In many ways, De Geer's concerns mirror that of modern Quaternary geologists and palaeoclimatologists, particularly his recognition of the need for high-resolution natural archives of past change, and the importance of testing whether global change is synchronous. De Geer's principle failing was his faith in teleconnections, where his findings were clearly influenced by his preconceptions. His belief that variations in solar radiation were the principal agent of all climate change has also since been shown to be incorrect. Nevertheless, De Geer asked all the right questions, and his errors can be attributed as much to over-enthusiasm and a single-minded passion, as they can to bad science.

Retrieved 24 August 2006. at a cost of US $4 million, was originally the headquarters for the Magnolia Petroleum Company. In 1934, the company erected its trademark neon Pegasus on the building's roof (the Pegasus logo later became the logo of Mobil Oil who merged with Magnolia Petroleum in 1959) to celebrate the American Petroleum Institute's annual meeting, held in Dallas for the first time. The rotating winged horse came to represent the city of Dallas and became one of its most recognizable and endearing landmarks, even after the building became obscured by much larger skyscrapers (the neon Pegasus can now only be seen in the downtown skyline approaching from the south). By 1974, however, Pegasus stopped rotating due to mechanical problems and in 1977 the property was sold to the city of Dallas. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The building was purchased by Denver, Colorado developers in 1997 and was converted into the luxury 330-room Magnolia Hotel. In 1999, in preparation for Dallas's Millennium Celebration, Pegasus was taken down to be completely restored. However, the sign was beyond repair and a new sign was recreated from scratch. At midnight on 1 January 2000, the new Pegasus, complete with rotation, was lit for the first time. A copy of the original sign, which sat atop a Mobil Oil station in the Casa Linda neighborhood of Dallas for many decades, is now on display at the Old Red Museum.

The term is derived from the word bachelor, and is often used by journalists, editors of popular magazines, and some individuals. \\"Bachelorette\\" was famously the term used to refer to female contestants on the old The Dating Game TV show and, more recently, The Bachelorette. In older English, the female counterpart term to \\"bachelor\\" was \\"spinster\\". However, this has acquired negative connotations and, when used now, tends to imply that the unmarried woman is too old to find a husband and have children.\\"A woman still unmarried; esp. one beyond the usual age of marriage, an old maid\\" ‚Äî definition 2b, entry \\"Spinster\\", OED 1st edition. A bachelorette may have previously been in a relationship. In Canada, the term bachelorette also refers to a small bachelor apartment (an apartment with only one large room serving as a bedroom and living room plus a separate bathroom‚Äîi.e. a studio apartment). Derivation The more proper neologism would be bacheloress, since the -ess suffix is the standard English suffix denoting a female subject, while -ette is a French-origin diminutive suffix, mainly used to denote something is smaller in size. However, in American English the -ess suffix is only marginally morphologically productive, and the -ette suffix can indicate a feminine version of a noun without a change in size (though many such words in -ette were intended to be jocular when they were first coined). The -ess suffix is also slowly falling into disuse in the English language due to attempts to neutralize professional terms; it is therefore less commonly applied to new terms nowadays. Reasons for use An archaic English term for a woman who has never married is a spinster, while a woman who is divorced is a divorc√©e, and a woman whose spouse has died is a widow. \\"Spinster\\" often implied that the woman was older than the age when most women traditionally marry and that she would probably never marry; a more derogatory term was \\"old maid\\". Typically, a young person (male or female) who has never been married is said to be \\"single\\" or \\"never married\\". The term \\"bachelorette\\" may indicate a woman who is unmarried by choice, the counterpart to the term \\"bachelor\\".

His nephew, Robert Flemming, was likely an illegitimate son of Robert Flemming, esquire, of Wath, near Ripon (d.1459). Fleming was educated at University College, Oxford. Having taken his degrees, he was made prebendary of York in 1406, and the next year was junior proctor of the university. In 1409 he was appointed to the committee of twelve censors who were commissioned to examine the writings of John Wyclif and determine the heretical ideas they contained. Later that year he was accused of supporting some of Wyclif's errors in a public disputation, for which he incurred the censure of Archbishop Arundel. Fleming must have either been exonerated or renounced his supposed heresy because he was still a member of the committee of censors when its list of Wycliffe's errors was published in 1411 (Nighman, 2003, pp.208-10). Before 1415 Fleming was instituted to the rectory of Boston in Lincolnshire. He attended the Council of Constance from late 1416 to early 1418 where he delivered a number of sermons which survive, all of which reveal a strong concern for clerical reform (Nighman, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2008a, 2008b). He was nominated to the see of Lincoln by papal provision on 20 November 1419 and on 28 April 1420 he was consecrated as bishop of Lincoln by Martin V in Florence. He attended the Council of Pavia and Siena in 1428‚Äì1429 and, in the presence of the pope, reportedly made an eloquent speech in vindication of the rights of the English \\"nation\\" and in support of papal authority against the more radical proponents of conciliarism; this sermon apparently does not survive. It was probably on this occasion that he was named chamberlain to the pope. In February 1424 the see of York being vacant, the pope conferred it on Fleming; but the regency council of the young king Henry VI refused to confirm the appointment, and Fleming resigned the appointment in July 1425. In 1427, Fleming obtained a royal licence empowering him to found a college at Oxford for the special purpose of training theologians to combat Wyclif's heresy. To Bishop Fleming was entrusted the execution of the decree of the Council of Constance for the exhumation and burning of Wycliffe's remains, though Fleming delayed fulfilling this duty for over a decade. He died at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, in January 1431. Although his foundation of Lincoln College, Oxford, was incomplete at the time of his death, the college's future was eventually secured and Fleming's manuscript books became the core collection of the collegiate library (de la Mare, 1962-3).

At their height in the 850s, family head Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi was so powerful and autonomous that he would be called 'The Third Monarch of Hispania'. In the first half of the 10th century, an intra-family succession squabble, rebellions and rivalries with competing families, in the face of vigorous monarchs to the north and south, led to the sequential loss of all of their land. Dynastic beginnings The family is said to descend from the Hispano-Roman or Visigothic nobleman named Cassius. Muslim chronicles and the Chronicle of Alfonso III suggest he was a Visigoth. According to the 10th century Muwallad historian, Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714 as the mawlƒÅ (client) of the Umayyads, shortly after their conquest of Hispania. After his conversion, he is said to have traveled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Umayyad Caliph, Al-Walid I. Under the Banu Qasi, the region of Upper Ebro (modern districts of Logro√±o and southern Navarre, based in Tudela) formed a semi-autonomous principality. The tiny emirate was faced by enemies in several directions. Although never realized, the threat of Frankish attempts to regain control over the western Pyrenees was a real one. In actuality, even more menacing was the gradual eastwards expansion of the Asturian Kingdom; while in the south lay the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, ever anxious to impose its authority over the frontier regions. As a local Muslim dynasty in the Ebro valley (the Upper March of Al-Andalus; , A·πØ- ·πÆa·∏°r al-A øl√†), the Banu Qasi were nominally clients of the emirate, but they thrived on regional rivalries and alliances with other Muwallad dynasties of the Upper March, the Vascon tribal chieftains of Pamplona and Aragon, as well as with the Catalan counts of Pallars-Ribagorza to the north and Barcelona to the east, the Kingdom of Asturias to the west and the Umayyads to the south over the next two centuries. They frequently intermarried with other regional nobility, both Muslim and Christian. Musa ibn Musa and the Pamplona king √ç√±igo Arista were maternal half-brothers, while Musa also married Arista's daughter, and his own daughter and nieces were married to other Pyrenean princes. The cultural ambivalence of the Banu Qasi is also demonstrated by their mixed use of names: for example, Arabic (Muhammad, Musa, Abd Allah), Latinate (Awriya, Furtun, Lubb), and Basque (Garshiya). The Umayyads of Cordova sanctioned the rule of the Banu Qasi and repeatedly granted them autonomy by appointing them as governors, only to replace them as they expressed too much independence, or launch punitive military expeditions into the region. Such acts on the part of the Umayyads demonstrated their failure to ever fully resolve the problem of effective, central control of outlying regions. First rise to prominence The speculated homeland of Count Cassius was a narrow strip across the Ebro from Tudela. The Arab historian Ibn Hazm listed the sons of Count Cassius as Furtun, Abu Tawr, Abu Salama, Yunus and Yahya. Of these, it has been suggested that the second may be the Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca, who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778. Likewise, the Banu Salama, removed from power in Huesca and Barbitanya (the area of Barbastro) at the end of the 8th century, may have derived from Abu Salama. Subsequent leaders of the family descend from the eldest son, Furtun. His son, Musa ibn Furtun ibn Qasi, first garnered notice in 788, when on behalf of emir Hisham I of C√≥rdoba he put down the rebellion of the Banu Husain in Zaragoza. The fate of Musa ibn Furtun is debated. An account of the 788 rebellion tells of Musa's murder shortly thereafter at the hands of a Banu Husain follower, yet a \\"Furtun ibn Musa\\" is said to have been killed in his own 802 Zaragoza uprising, and it has been suggested that this name may be an error for Musa ibn Furtun. However, Ibn Hayyan also reports a Furtun from the Banu Qasi forming a coalition with Pamplona, √Ålava, Castile, Amaya and Cerdanya to fight against Amrus ibn Yusuf at this time, suggesting that this is instead a son of Musa ibn Furtun overlooked by Ibn Hazm, whose genealogy provides most of what we know about the clan. In the next generation, Mutarrif ibn Musa, was likely a son of Musa ibn Furtun, although historian Ibn Hayyan only mentions his name and does not say that he was a member of the Banu Qasi clan. According to Ibn Hayyan, \\"in (183 H: 799-800) the people of Pamplona deceived Mutarrif ibn Musa and killed him\\". \\"This is perhaps one of the most quoted paragraphs by historians who on the basis of this brief news, have woven a complex web of relationships involving the Banu Qasi, the Arista and the Carolingians\\". √âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal was the first to say that \\"Pamplona, the capital of Vasconia, had not been governed by the Muslims since 798 (...) and that its inhabitants had killed the representative of the Umayyad authorities, Mutarrif ben Musa Ben Qasi, and had chosen one of their own, named Velasco.\\" This Velasco would be the same \\"enemy of God, Balashk al-Yalashqi, Lord of Pamplona\\", a pro-Carolingian against whom the Muslims launched a military campaign in 816. Spanish historian Claudio S√°nchez Albornoz did not agree with this interpretation and believed that it had been the people of Pamplona, without any outside intervention, who took matters in their own hands. No where does Ibn Hayyan mention that Mutarrif ibn Musa was the governor of Pamplona or that Velasco was pro-Carolingian. It was Musa's son Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi whose rule brought the family to the peak of its power. Musa ibn Musa Bust honouring Musa ibn Musa in Tudela, Navarre. Besides the Arab sources, Musa ibn Musa is mentioned in three Latin texts: the Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis; the Albendensis; and the C√≥dice de Roda. The latter mentions his family relations as the half-brother and son-in-law of King √ç√±igo Arista and the properties he held. The Albeldensis describes the Battle of Monte Laturce, also referred to as the second Battle of Albelda, whereas the Chronicle of Alfonso III provides a more detailed account of his life and feats. While Musa had been orphaned at an early age, his military activity may have begun in the 820s, and the Banu Qasi (possibly Musa himself) most probably participated in the second battle of the pass of Roncevaux along with their relatives of Pamplona, an event leading to the establishment of the kingdom of Pamplona. Historians agree that in the 840s, after the expulsion from his lands of a kinsman, 'Abd al-Jabbar ibn Qasi, Musa launched a series of revolts in conjunction with his maternal half-brother, √ç√±igo Arista of Pamplona. Abd ar-Rahman II defeated them, and took Musa's son Lubb hostage. Musa repeatedly submitted, only to rise again. After repeated rebellions he controlled a region along the Ebro from Borja to Logro√±o, including Tudela, Tarazona, Arnedo and Calahorra. The 851/2 deaths of √ç√±igo Arista and Abd ar- Rahman II, as well as a victory over Christian forces at Albelda, gave Musa unprecedented status. The new emir, Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba named Musa the Wali of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March. Over the next decade Musa expanded the family's lands to include Zaragoza, Najera, Viguera and Calatayud, while also governing Tudela, Huesca and Toledo, and according to the Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis, Musa had his followers call him \\"the third king of Spaniae\\". Throughout this period, as reported by Ibn Hazm, Musa was also involved in a struggle within his family. Musa's brother Yunus ibn Musa is said to have remained loyal to C√≥rdoba, and joined with the sons of their uncle Zahir ibn Furtun to fight Musa over a period of about 30 years. Ibn Hazm reports that Yunus had descendants, but provides no further details. In 859, Ordo√±o I of Asturias and Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona joined forces to deal Musa a crushing defeat at Albelda, which passed into Christian legend as the Battle of Clavijo. Emir Muhammad then stripped Musa of his titles and restored direct Cordoban control over the region. Musa died in 862 of wounds received in a petty squabble with a son-in-law, and the family disappeared from the political scene for a decade. Sons of Musa Following the 862 death of Musa, nothing is known of the family until 871. It is presumed that the members of the family associated with the Cordoban court and military campaigns, but no record of their presence there survives. According to the Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis, upon learning of his father's defeat at Albelda, his son Lubb ibn Musa ibn with all his men, submitted themselves to the rule of the Asturian king Ordo√±o and became his lifelong subjects. By the time the Banu Qasi reappear, they had lost control of most of their lands, being left with just a small area surrounding Arnedo. In 870, a rebellion in Huesca initiated a chain of events that would bring the Banu Qasi back to dominance. In that year, Amrus ibn Umar of the Banu Amrus assassinated the amil Musa ibn Galind, thought to have been son of the C√≥rdoba-resident brother of Pamplona king Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez. The Amir, Muhammad, sent an army to the north, but Amrus allied himself with Garc√≠a, and the Cordoban general, Abd al- Gafir ibn Abd al-Aziz, was killed before the gates of Zaragoza. The Banu Qasi sons of Musa, apparently under the leadership of eldest son Lubb ibn Musa, then allied themselves with Garc√≠a, and reestablished control over their father's possessions. First, the residents of Huesca called on Mutarrif ibn Musa ibn Qasi for leadership. In January 872, Isma'il ibn Musa entered Zaragoza, and was there joined by Lubb, the two of them together taking Monzon. Isma'il also allied himself with the Banu Jalaf of Barbitanya, marrying Sayyida, daughter of Abd Allah ibn Jalaf. Furtun ibn Musa occupied Tudela, whose governor the Banu Qasi imprisoned at Arnedo, then killed following an escape. Lubb also occupied and refortified Viguera. The immediate response of emir Muhammad was to try to limit the expansion of the Banu Qasi by installing a rival dynasty, the Arab Banu Tujib, in Calatayud, the one part of their father's possessions not reclaimed. In the next year, 873, Muhammad launched a campaign against the various northern rebels. He first bought off the rebels of Toledo with governorships, and this encouraged Amrus to offer his loyalty, for which he was rewarded with Huesca where he captured Mutarrif and his family, including wife Belasquita, the daughter of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona. In spite of a desperate attack by the combined troops of his brothers, Mutarrif and three sons, Muhammad, Musa and Lubb, were taken to C√≥rdoba and crucified. The next year, Furtun died in Tudela, while Lubb was killed in an accident in Viguera in 875. This left control of the family in the hands of two men, the remaining brother Isma'il ibn Musa in Monzon, and Lubb's son, Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi, who is first known as a defender of Zaragoza against the emirate troops. Muhammad ibn Lubb Over the next decade, following the deaths of his father and two uncles, Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi maneuvered to become the leader of the family. He resisted 879 and 882 campaigns from C√≥rdoba. The latter was under general, Hashim ibn Abd al- Aziz, and Muhammad tried to persuade Hashim to unite with him against the Asturians, now ruled by Alfonso III. The earlier hostage-taking done by all parties, greatly complicated such situation. Hashim did not want to antagonize Alfonso, who was holding his son as a hostage. Hashim himself held a son of Isma'il ibn Musa, and he sent his captive and other gifts to Alfonso in return for his son. Muhammad would later ally himself with the kings of Pamplona and Asturias, and it was apparently he who raised the future Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n at his court. The struggle for power within the Banu Qasi family came to a head in 882, when Muhammad fought, near Calahorra, a 7000-man force of his uncle Isma'il ibn Musa, and Isma'il ibn Furtun, a son of his uncle Furtun. In the following internecine squabbles, Furtun's four sons were killed and Isma'il ibn Musa was forced to retreat to Monzon. From there he rebuilt Lleida and routed an army sent by Wilfred of Barcelona. Muhammad ibn Lubb, now the clear head of the family, was left in control of the majority of the Banu Qasi lands. In 884, the emir sent two military campaigns into the region and took Zaragoza, although chronicler Ibn Hayyan reports that Muhammad ibn Lubb had sold the city to count Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza prior to its fall. This resulted in a consolidated Banu Qasi powerbase around Arnedo, Borja, Calahorra and Viguera, with Isma'il holding an enclave to the east, around Monzon and Lleida. In 885 and 886, Muhammad launched attacks against Castile, in the first apparently killing count Diego Rodr√≠guez Porcelos, while the second was an attack on √Ålava in which many Christians were killed. The latter year also saw the death of emir Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba. Muhammad ibn Lubb tested his power against the new emirs, and they responded by again trying to balance Banu Qasi power in the region, giving Zaragoza to the rival Tujibids, and Huesca to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil of the Muwallad Banu Shabrit clan. The latter was shortly challenged by Isma'il ibn Musa, whose sons fought a battle against al-Tawil's troops, Musa ibn Isma'il being killed and his brother Mutarrif captured. Isma'il died shortly thereafter, in 889, and al- Tawil and Muhammad ibn Lubb each took their case to emir Abd Allah for possession of Isma'il's lands, the emir confirming the succession of Muhammad ibn Lubb. There followed a period of relative peace and collaboration between Muhammad ibn Lubb and al-Tawil. In 891, Muhammad defeated a Christian force at Castro Sibiriano, but he dedicated most of his efforts in his final years against Tujibid Zaragoza, initiating what would become a 17-year siege. In 897, the citizens of Toledo rose up and offered their city to Muhammad, but being occupied with Zaragoza, he sent his son Lubb. Muhammad was reconnoitering Zaragoza in 898, when on 8 October, he was caught by a guard who spitted him on a lance. His head was presented to the Tujibids, who sent it to C√≥rdoba, where it was displayed in front of the palace for eight days before being buried with the honors due a brave foe. Lubb ibn Muhammad Muhammad's son, Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, was born in 870, and was already active at the time of his father's death. In 896, he was refortifying Monzon when al-Tawil of Huesca tried his luck. Though being attacked by a larger, better equipped army, Lubb was able to rout al-Tawil's men, taking his brother prisoner. In January 897 he went to Toledo to take up the leadership offer the citizens had made his father. Back in the east, he launched an attack on Aura that led to the death of Wilfred of Barcelona. Returning through Toledo in 898, he next marched to Ja√©n, with the intent of forming a coalition with another rebel, Umar ibn Hafsun, but before Umar reached Ja√©n, the news of his father's death at Zaragoza forced Lubb's return to Tudela, where he formally recognized the sovereignty of the emir, Abd Allah, in exchange for the formal governorship over Tudela and Tarazona. His return north found al-Tawil moving to take advantage of the temporary power vacuum and three weeks after his father's death, Lubb captured the Huesca ruler in a skirmish. To buy his freedom, al-Tawil ceded lands between Huesca and Monzon to Lubb, and agreed to pay 100,000 gold dinares for the possession of Huesca. Paying 50,000 immediately, he gave his son Abd al-Malik and daughter Sayyida as hostages to ensure payment of the second half. Lubb would relent, forgiving the remaining debt and returning the hostages except Sayyida, whom he married. Lubb ibn Muhammad continued his father's siege of Zaragoza, but found himself drawn in other directions. Perhaps in 900, Alfonso III, in conjunction with Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona, launched a raid against Tarazona, in Lubb's realms; which he successfully blocked. Then in 903, Toledo again rebelled against Cordova, asking Lubb to take control. He sent his brother Mutarrif, who was proclaimed their Amir. Mutarrif's fate is unknown, but by 906, he had been replaced by Lubb's kinsman, Muhammad ibn Isma'il, son of Isma'il ibn Musa, who was then assassinated. Alfonso again attacked Lubb's lands, laying siege to Gra√±√≥n, but was forced to lift the siege when Lubb moved with an army toward Alava. This threat neutralized, Lubb turned toward Pallars, ravaging the lands, killing hundreds and taking a thousand captives, including Isarn, Count Raymond's son, who was kept in Tudela for a decade before being freed. In 905, a coalition of the King of Asturias, the counts of Aragon and Pallars, and, it is sometimes claimed, Lubb ibn Muhammad, engineered a coup in Navarre that brought Sancho Garc√©s to the throne in place of Fort√∫n Garc√©s. Two years later, Lubb launched an attack on Pamplona and fought at \\"Li√©dena\\" on 30 September 907, resulting in a total rout of the Banu Qasi forces, while Lubb was killed. The transcendent battle marked a permanent change in the regional balance, Sancho's Pamplona becoming a major regional power, while it initiated the final decline of the Banu Qasi. Decline (905-929) With the fall of Lubb, his local rivals immediately fell upon the Banu Qasi lands. Sancho descended toward Calahorra. The Tujibids finally broke the siege of Zaragoza and captured Ejea. Al-Tawil retook the lands he had lost, and proceeded to overrun the family's eastern enclave, taking Barbastro and Lleida. Monzon was briefly controlled by Lubb's brother Yunus ibn Muhammad, but he could not hold it, and Monzon too fell to the al-Tawil. In the reduced western lands, Lubb was succeeded by brother Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi. In 911, Abd Allah and al-Tawil jointly, along with al-Tawil's brother-in-law Galindo Azn√°rez II of Aragon, attacked Pamplona. After destroying several castles, they developed cold feet and withdrew, but were caught by Sancho. Al-Tawil defected and escaped, while Galindo was crushed and forced to recognize Sancho as feudal sovereign, ending the autonomy of the Aragon. Arab sources describe Abd Allah's rear-guard action at Luesia as a victory, but if so it was only a tactical victory and he immediately retreated south. In 914, Sancho turned the tables, marching into the heart of the Banu Qasi homeland, taking Arnedo and attacking Calahorra. In the next year, 915, Sancho turned toward Tudela, and there captured Abd Allah, killing a thousand of his best men. Mutarrif ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, Abd Allah's brother, rushed to relieve the city, and Abd Allah was ransomed, his daughter Urraca and probably son Furtun ibn Abd Allah being given as hostages. However, two months later Abd Allah was assassinated, it is said, through the machinations of Sancho. The only bright spot for the family in this period happened in the east. In 913, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil died, and the next year, the residents of Monzon rejected his son Amrus ibn Muhammad, and invited the Banu Qasi to return in the person of Muhammad ibn Lubb, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad. After a brief siege, he was able to reclaim the city for his family, as well as Lleida. In the west, Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and his nephew Muhammad ibn Abd Allah struggled for dominance. The latter proved victorious, killing Mutarrif in 916. Since the death of Lubb in 907, the Banu Qasi had been left fractured and weakened in the face of two resurgent powers: to the north and west, a collaboration between the new king of Le√≥n, Ordo√±o II, and Sancho I of Navarre brought a strong army south, ravaging the Banu Qasi lands around Viguera, Najera and Tudela in 918, while the young and energetic Abd ar-Rahman III, who was to temporarily reverse the centrifugal forces at work in the Emirate, soon to be Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, sent armies north, routing the Christians. The next year, both Banu Qasi leaders, Muhammad ibn Abd Allah and Muhammad ibn Lubb, attacked the Banu al- Tawil at Barbastro, but Sancho took advantage of this, and allying himself with his cousin Bernard I of Ribagorza and the Banu al-Tawil, he attacked and burned Monzon, which was hence lost to the Banu Qasi. In 920, the emir, Abd ar-Rahman III, personally led the Cordoban army north, and forced Sancho to abandon fortifications he had been building. After some maneuvering the emir met the armies of Ordo√±o and Sancho, and defeated them at Valdejunquera. In 923, the Christian allies brought another force south, and while Muhammad ibn Abd Allah formed a coalition of local nobles to resist it, their armies were dispersed and Viguera and Najera fell. Like his father, Muhammad was captured, then assassinated on Sancho's orders, and when Abd ar-Rahman launched another punitive campaign the next year, on his return to Tudela he removed the Banu Qasi and sent them to C√≥rdoba, placing their old rivals the Tujibids of Zaragoza in their place. After 923, only the eastern enclave encompassing Lleida and the hus√ªn of Balaguer, Barbastro and Ayera were in the hands of the family. However, one by one these expelled Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi and turned to the Tujibids for leadership, leaving him only Ayera in 928, when Jimeno Garc√©s, the new king of Navarre, intervened on his behalf in opposition to Hasim ibn Muhammad al-Tujibi. The next year, Muhammad fell victim to an ambush and was killed by his brother-in-law, a son of Raymond of Pallars. Legacy The death of Muhammad ibn Lubb marked the end of the Banu Qasi in the Ebro valley. Their rivals the Tujibids would follow their model, making an independent peace with Leon in 937, a move that resulted in a punitive expedition from the Caliph similar to those of prior years against the Banu Qasi. The Tujibids would eventually establish a full-fledged Taifa kingdom centered at Zaragoza. Two other Taifa crowns were ruled by men with names reminiscent of the Banu Qasi and are claimed as dynastic members, although there is no evidence of any actual genealogical connection. A small Taifa state at Alpuente was founded by Abd Allah ibn Qasim. He was of a convert family that claimed a tribal affiliation with the Yamanƒ´/F√≠hrƒ´. In 1144, another Christian convert and Sufi mystic from Silves, Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, called ibn Qasi, rose and established a Taifa state at M√©rtola, expanding it to much of southern Portugal, and he encouraged the successful move of the Almohads (to whom he would submit) against Seville.

The Inde has a counterpart, a \\"small Inde\\", in France: the Andelle, which is a long river in the French d√©partement Seine-Maritime and whose original name was Indella. The suffix -ella is an example for Celtic river names comparing for instance Mosella (= Moselle, i.e. \\"small Mosa (= Maas)\\"). For the name \\"Inde\\", the Indoeuropean stem *wed (= water) is supposed, like in words like Italian \\"onda\\" and French \\"onde\\" (= wave).

The term is a reference to one of the twin eggs from which Helen of Troy was born. The eggs were laid by Leda after Zeus, disguised as a swan, either seduced and mated with or raped her, according to different versions.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.  In literature  The English literary use of the phrase comes from Horace's Ars Poetica, where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who \\"does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg\\" (), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (in medias res). This advice is famously rejected in Laurence Sterne's novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. This use is distinct from the longer phrase ab ovo usque ad mala (lit. \\"from the egg to the apples\\") which appears in Horace's Satire 1.3.

Brothers is a fundamentalist preacher and author from Rochester, New York, USA. Freedom Village He is best known as the founder of Freedom Village (FV), a home for troubled teens operated from a Christian Fundamentalist perspective and founded in Lakemont, New York in 1981. The campus was the site of the Lakemont Academy, a secular boys boarding school. Freedom Village also operated an office in Burlington, Ontario and it had many students from Canada. Representatives of FV have been invited to speak at public schools in the United States and Canada. Parents are allowed to visit their children on a prearranged basis every month after the first three months, and students are asked to commit to remain in the program for one year. Children are required to write one letter a week to their families. Phone calls are limited to one call a week which is made in the presence of a staff member. The intake process is the interview process where children individually meet with a staff member who will ask them several questions regarding their application to Freedom Village. While information about past criminal history, drug use, etc., is factored into the decision to accept a child, the primary criteria for acceptance is a stated willingness to follow the rules and guidelines of the program as well as a commitment to complete twelve full months of enrollment. Students are ranked according to a system of levels which ranges from no-level to Junior Staff. Students enter the program on C-Level and they can progress either upward or downward in the levels based on their behavior. During all meals, chapel sessions, school and church sessions the teenagers are segregated by gender. Dating is only allowed among program students who have obtained a certain privilege level and staff approval. Freedom Village abides by very formal standards of personal dress and conduct. Young people are required to wear loose fitting, baggy apparel. Pastor Brothers also preaches against secular music and he has even been outspoken against \\"Christian rock.\\" FV produces the daily 30-minute \\"Victory Today\\" radio show, featuring Fletcher Brothers's preaching and occasional interviews with FV staff or students. His theological outlook is generally informed by an apocalyptic form of fundamentalism which teaches that the imminent return of Christ will occur within his own lifetime, a view that is common in fundamentalism. Brothers has often spoken out very loudly against adultery; however, Fletcher Brothers has been married 4 times. During his third marriage, this time to Linda, he had an affair with Carrie McCandless, who was also married at the time. Extensive measures were taken to cover up the affair. Brothers even went so far as to inform her then husband that Freedom Village was not God‚Äôs will for him, sending him off into the world to find God‚Äôs will but informing him that Carrie‚Äôs calling was to work at Freedom Village and convincing him to leave her there so she could ‚Äúserve God‚Äù.

She was a vocalist with the bands Dada and Vinegar Joe, and later became a solo artist. She gained her biggest success in the late 1970s and 1980s, releasing 13 UK Top 75 singles, and reached the top ten with \\"Pearl's a Singer\\", \\"Sunshine After the Rain\\" and the title track of the album No More the Fool. She has been nominated twice for Brit Awards. She is generally referred to as the \\"British Queen of Blues\\". Life and career Early career and Vinegar Joe Brooks was born Elaine Bookbinder in Broughton, Salford, the daughter of Marjorie Violet \\"Vi\\" (n√©e Newton) and Kalmon Charles \\"Charlie\\" Bookbinder. She was raised in Prestwich. She attended North Salford Secondary Modern School. Her older brothers are Raymond Bookbinder (born 1938) and Anthony Bookbinder (born 28 May 1943), who went by the stage name of Tony Mansfield, and was drummer for Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas, on their run of 1960s hit records. According to Brooks, her unofficial debut was a gig at a club called the \\"Laronde\\" on Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, when she was 13 years old. She first sang professionally at the age of 15, and her first record, a cover of Etta James's \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\\", was released on Decca in 1964. Brooks spent most of the 1960s on Britain's cabaret scene, a period of her life that she did not particularly enjoy.Interview on Woman's Hour, BBC Radio 4, Wednesday, 31 March 2010. In the mid 1960s she supported the Beatles in their Christmas show in London, then, as an established act, helped the Small Faces in their early career by introducing them at several venues. She went on to tour the United States with several bands, including the Animals. She also toured the then communist Poland with Jon Lord's Artwoods. After she met Pete Gage, whom she would marry, she joined the short- lived blues rock fusioneers Dada before forming Vinegar Joe with Gage and Robert Palmer. Brooks gained the reputation as the wild woman of rock 'n' roll due to her wild stage performances. After three albums, they split up in 1974, and Brooks and Palmer pursued separate solo careers. After a time as backing singer with the American southern boogie band Wet Willie, she returned to England. Solo career and chart success Her first solo album on A&M; records was Rich Man's Woman (1975). It was released to critical acclaim, but Brooks was given a hard time because of the album's cover shot of a naked Brooks with a feather boa, which was considered outrageous for the time. It came before a run of 16 albums in 20 years, starting with Two Days Away (1977), produced by the songwriting duo Leiber & Stoller, who had also worked with Elvis Presley and many others. Brooks also wrote some tracks with them. The hits \\"Pearl's a Singer\\" and \\"Sunshine After the Rain\\" came from this album. That same year, Brooks duetted with Cat Stevens in the song, \\"Remember the Days of the Old Schoolyard\\". The albums Shooting Star (1978) and Live and Learn (1979) also saw success along with the singles \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\". Her polished, powerful cover of Gallagher and Lyle's \\"The Runaway\\", saw the Scottish singer-songwriters appear with Brooks on TOTP's to provide backing vocals. In 1980, Brooks performed at the Knebworth Festival with the Beach Boys, Santana and Mike Oldfield. The Pearls album released in 1981 achieved the biggest success of her career, charting for 79 weeks and reaching No 2, the album was still in the charts one year later when Pearls ll (1982) reached No 5 and spent 26 weeks on the UK charts. The Gus Dudgeon produced \\"Fool If You Think It's Over (1981)\\" was a major hit single for Brooks, written by Chris Rea. Other charts singles followed with \\"Our Love\\" \\"Nights In White Satin\\" & Gasoline Alley all produced by Gus Dudgeon. Minutes (1984) and Screen Gems (1984), were both all UK album chart hits in the same year. In 1986, she sang the title song for the BBC television series \\"A Very Peculiar Practice\\". The song, written by Dave Greenslade, was never released as a commercial recording. In early 1987, the song \\"No More the Fool\\" reached the top five and became her biggest hit single to date with the parent album also reaching the top five. This led to her achieving another career peak, as she had two albums in the Top Ten and a single in the Top Ten all on the same week. Following chart success ensued with the albums The Very Best of Elkie Brooks (1986), Bookbinder's Kid (1988), Inspiration (1989), Round Midnight (1993), Nothin' but the Blues (1994), Amazing (1996) and The Very Best of Elkie Brooks (1997). In March 2003, she participated in the ITV music talent show Reborn in the USA, alongside musicians such as Peter Cox, Tony Hadley and Leee John. Also in 2003 she issued a CD, Trouble in Mind, with the acclaimed Humphrey Lyttelton and his Band, which included Bad Penny Blues with added lyrics.

The following year saw the release of her first official DVD, Elkie Brooks & Friends: Pearls, featuring an array of guest musicians. Brooks's twentieth studio album, Powerless also produced by son Jermaine Jordan was released in 2010, featuring songs such as Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\" and Dylan's \\"Make You Feel My Love\\". She continues to perform live throughout the UK and Ireland. In 2012, Brooks released her autobiography Finding My Voice, published by The Robson Press. In it she details her life and career, focusing on her love of performing live and the downsides of the recording business, which has often left her financially no better off.North Devon Journal, Elkie Brooks autobiography signing at Waterstones. 30 August 2012 In July 2017 after signing to Virgin EMI she issued a new CD Elkie Brooks: Pearls The Very Best Of, which charted at No 14 and included two new singles: \\"Love Ain't Something that You Can Get for Free\\" and the Bryan Adams penned \\"Forgive and Forget\\" later in the year a remix of the 1979 album track \\"The Rising Cost of Love\\" was also released as a single, all 3 singles made it to the Radio 2 'A' playlist with \\"Forgive & Forget\\" being the Radio 2 \\"Record of the Week\\" .

In 2017 Brooks recorded the closing theme song \\"Running to the Future\\" for the British movie Finding Your Feet, starring Imelda Staunton, Timothy Spall, Celia Imrie and Joanna Lumley. The track was released as a download only single and was included in the soundtrack CD album. Her self-penned song \\"Just An Excuse\\" has been the subject of various remixes, most notably appearing on the Bonobo album Migration (2017) which was a UK No 5 hit. Brooks has performed live since 1960 and continuously every year since 1977 with current concert dates set throughout 2020 billed as the 60th anniversary tour. Personal life In the early to mid-1970s, Brooks was married to guitarist Pete Gage. On 1 March 1978, she married her sound engineer, Trevor Jordan. They are still married, live in Devon and have two sons, Jermaine (born 22 December 1979) and Joseph (born 31 December 1986). Between 1981 and 2002 they lived in a mansion in a secluded area of North Devon. However, in 1998, after her accountant informed her that he had not been paying her taxes, Brooks found herself in severe debt and was reduced to living in a mobile home. After four years of increasing interest bills and loans, Brooks managed to sell her home (after being threatened with repossession) and cleared all of her debts.Finding My Voice, Elkie Brooks autobiography.

Maidenbower is located in the south east corner of the town, bordering the M23 motorway. It is bordered by Pound Hill to the north and Furnace Green to the west across the railway line. Maidenbower is the newest of the neighbourhoods in Crawley. In 1986 Crawley Borough Council declared the farmland between the M23 and the London-Brighton railway line to be the 13th neighbourhood. A consortium of builders was formed to develop the site which was to include community facilities and a new junction giving access to the M23. By 2000 development was almost complete, although small areas of infill development continue. The original 16th-century Frogshole farm building, unlike the adjoining Maidenbower farm that gave the area its name, remains as the public house for the neighbourhood. It was refurbished and opened in 1994. On 8 February 2007 it suffered a major fire. Frogshole Farm Pub re-opened in July 2008 after a major refurbishment. A secondary school, the Oriel High School, has been built at Maidenbower under the Private Finance Initiative: a private company designed and built the school and is planned to provide facilities management for the next 25 years. West Sussex County Council provides all the educational services and staff. Maidenbower also has two infants schools and a large junior school. There is a parade of shops and a community centre that provides daycare facilities for elderly people and people with disabilities. The Gatwick Stream runs through Maidenbower (formerly through Frogshole farm), past the back of the parade of shops and on to Three Bridges.

It is centered on the southern part of Randsfjorden in Innlandet (formerly Oppland) and Viken (formerly Buskerud), and consists of the municipalities Gran in Innlandet County and Jevnaker and Lunner in Viken County. Hadeland occupies the area north of the hills of Nordmarka close to the Norwegian capital Oslo. The soil around the Randsfjord is amongst the most fertile in Norway. Hadeland accounts for just 5% of the country's area, but it represents 13% of its agricultural land. Farmers harvest grains and potatoes. Pigs, dairy cattle and horses are also bred by farms there. Jevnaker is located to the southern and western side of the Randsfjord. Gran's rolling countryside is home to about two-thirds of the 30,000 people living in Hadeland. The village of Gran serves as the area's main center of commerce. The municipality of Gran is divided by the Randsfjord, and its western part is known as the Fjorda district. Most of the northern parish Brandbu has been absorbed into today's municipality Gran. The Hadeland area includes large stretches of woodland. Approximately 69% of Lunner is covered by forest. Nearly half of the wooded area in Lunner and Jevnaker is common land (almenning). The local forestry cooperative plays a key role in the economies of the two areas. Their woods are home to a variety of flora and fauna, and host a number of species of birds, deer, elk and other wildlife. Populations of trout, char, bass and other freshwater fish have dwindled in the inland lakes and streams, but restocking efforts are now made. Etymology The name of Hadeland comes from the Old Norse name for the inhabitants, ha√∞ar, which is assumed to be connected to war. The name would then mean \\"the land of the warriors.\\" History A number of Stone Age sites have been discovered around the Randsfjord and over 200 artefacts - including jewellery, tools, and weapons - have been unearthed. During this period the people here, as in most of southern Norway, lived as hunter-gatherers, exploiting the resources of the large forests. By the end of the Bronze Age, agriculture had evolved and archaeological evidence points to the division of land into family or clan- based farms. Several Bronze Age burial mounds have been identified in Hadeland. Roman references to this area as Hadeland may be found in documents dating from AD200-400. The name refers to the ha√∞ar people. It is thought that ha√∞ar may relate to one of the many tribes or clans in the area, thus Hadeland would mean land of the ha√∞ar. Archaeologists have found a wide variety of weapons in Iron Age burial sites throughout Hadeland. In the late Iron Age, Hadeland was a petty kingdom. One of the more prominent kings of Hadeland was Halfdan Hvitbeinn who lived in the 8th century. View over Jarenvatnet, a small lake in Gran. According to the Icelandic sagas early Viking Age chieftains enjoyed hunting and entertaining their entourages in the forests and on the lakes in this area. King Halfdan the Black, father of king Harald Fairhair who united Norway, often visited Hadeland. According to historical sources he and his men attended a banquet here in the winter of 860. As they were crossing the ice on Randsfjord on their way home to Ringerike, the ice gave way and horses, men, and the 40-year-old king himself drowned. The Hadeland Folkemuseum is built around a Viking burial mound at Granavollen which according to folklore contains the torso of King Halvdan. The name Hadeland appears on the Dynna stone, a runestone from about 1040-1050. Norway formally adopted Christianity in 1030, and the Dynna stone, with its scenes from the Nativity is one of the first Christian monuments in Norway. A number of medieval churches survive in Hadeland. Notable among them is the Tingelstad old church. This was built in the 13th century. Other churches include Lunner church and the Sister Churches at Granavollen. The Black Death arrived in Norway in the mid 14th century, and it is estimated that two-thirds of the population of Hadeland was wiped out.

Historical data Valentinite is a mineral named in the middle of the 19th century in honour of Basilius Valentinus, a writer on alchemy. He is the supposed author of the first book to give a detailed description of antimony and its compounds. From the contents of the book it is also obvious that Valentinus was familiar with the synthetic preparation of antimony trioxide, which was called 'the antimony flower'. Valentinite was first described in 1845 for an occurrence in the Les Chalanches Mine, Allemond, Is√®re, Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France. The first description of its occurrence in the region of P≈ô√≠bram in Bohemia comes roughly from the same time. This particular locality at one time produced the very best crystals of this mineral.

The population at the time of the 2001 census was 9,888. At the 2011 Census the population of the civil parish had increased to 10,378. The parish of Worth was one of the larger West Sussex parishes, encompassing the entire area along the West Sussex/Surrey border between the town of Crawley, east of its High Street, and East Grinstead.

Worth village St Nicholas' Church, the ancient parish church of Worth, has Saxon origins. Worth village is now an area within the neighbourhood of Pound Hill in the borough of Crawley. It was formerly a separate village, and its name is still used for the civil parish in which it was originally situated. Worth village has Saxon origins: Worth Church still retains its Saxon floor plan. The Wealden iron industry flourished here in the 17th and 18th centuries. The coming of the railway in 1855 brought more employment to the area, but the line closed in 1967.

This formation has become eroded by many tiny impacts, leaving the features rounded and worn. Little of the original rim still stands above the surrounding terrain, leaving only a depression in the surface. The interior is relatively flat, with a rougher surface in the eastern half. There are several tiny craterlets on the crater interior, including a pair near the southwest inner wall and a small, bowl- shaped crater close to the eastern rim. Offset slightly to the northeast of the midpoint of the floor is a low central peak, now little more than a rounded hill.

It lies in the Orion constellationNASA, about 900 light-years from Earth. The nature of the dust particles, reflecting blue light better than red, is a factor in giving the Witch Head its blue color. Radio observations show substantial carbon monoxide emission throughout parts of IC 2118, an indicator of the presence of molecular clouds and star formation in the nebula. In fact candidates for pre-main sequence stars and some classic T-Tauri stars have been found deep within the nebula. The molecular clouds of IC 2118 are probably juxtaposed to the outer boundaries of the vast Orion- Eridanus bubble, a giant supershell of molecular hydrogen blown by the high mass stars of the Orion OB1 association. As the supershell expands into the interstellar medium, favorable circumstances for star formation occur. IC 2118 is located in one such area. The wind blown appearance and cometary shape of the bright reflection nebula is highly suggestive of a strong association with the high mass luminous stars of Orion OB1. The fact that the heads of the cometary clouds of IC2118 point northeast towards the association is strong support of that relationship.

Became Postmaster General for western C.S.A. in 1864. The South was then spit in two parts by federal control of the Mississippi River. Starr's problem was to provide mail service in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas and to devise means to get mail through the enemy military lines and naval blockade to and from westerners fighting east of the river and the confederate capital. This was essential to soldier and home front morale and to maintain necessary military and governmental communications. The mail was carried by pony express, wagons, blockade running vessels, stage coach lines, couriers, spies and army details. Starr competed with the army to get drivers, wagons and horses. Draft by military of postal employees was fought by writs of habeas corpus. \\"Men\\" under 16 were hired. Printing facilities were limited and forms, supplies, stamps had to be smuggled. The children of a cabinet officer once came through enemy lines with $3,000,000 worth of stamps for him. After the war, Starr in 1865 looked into East Texas oil showings. He founded Marshall's first bank. Starr county was named in his honor. Erected by the State of Texas 1963 James Harper Starr (December 18, 1809 ‚Äì July 25, 1890) served as a commissioner of the Texas General Land Office and later Secretary of the Treasury of the Republic of Texas and also as director of the postal service of the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War as well as the namesake of Starr County in Texas.

In addition to range, the more common two-dimensional radar provides only azimuth for direction, whereas the 3D radar also provides elevation. Applications include weather monitoring, air defense, and surveillance. The information provided by 3D radar has long been required, particularly for air defence and interception. Interceptors must be told the altitude to climb to before making an intercept. Before the advent of single unit 3D radars, this was achieved with separate search radars (giving range and azimuth) and separate height finding radars that could examine a target to determine altitude. These had little search capability, so were directed to a particular azimuth first found by the primary search radar.

John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol (February 1580 ‚Äì 21 January 1653),David L. Smith, ‚ÄòDigby, John, first earl of Bristol (1580‚Äì1653)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. was an English diplomat and a moderate royalist during the English Civil War.  Early career  He was the son of Sir George Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire, and Abigail, daughter of Sir Anthony (not Arthur) Heveningham and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the Inner Temple. He was knighted in 1606. He was briefly the Member of Parliament for Hedon in 1610. On his arriving at Court, his charm, good looks and diplomatic ability quickly gained him the favour of King James I, who sent him to Madrid as his ambassador to Spain during the early 1610s. He was rewarded by being created Baron Digby of Sherborne in 1618 and Earl of Bristol in 1622. Digby was a leading figure in the unsuccessful Spanish Match, the effort to marry Prince Charles to the Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. Digby was made the scapegoat for the failure of the marriage plan, recalled and ordered to reside on his estates. Charles after his accession offered Digby a return to royal favour if he would admit his blame for the failure of the match: Digby, who was a stubborn and hot-tempered man, and could be terrifying in his anger, refused. Charles, infuriated, impeached him and sent him to the Tower of London; Digby, undaunted, made counter-charges against George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the prime royal favourite. Ominously for the King's reputation, the House of Lords decided to hear Digby in his own defence first. His trial never proceeded, although he remained in the Tower until 1628, and the affair seriously damaged the King's reputation as a man of honour.Kenyon, J.P. Stuart England Allen Lane 1978 The murder of the Duke of Buckingham in August 1628 caused Digby to reconsider his opposition to the King: like Strafford and others among the Lords he was alarmed at Parliament's increasing radicalism. He offered his services to Charles and was formally reconciled with him. Charles, however, was slow to trust those who had ever opposed him and Digby had little influence at Court in the 1630s.Wedgwood, C.V., Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford-a revaluation, Jonathan Cape, 1961  Civil War  As the political crisis of the early 1640s mounted, Digby emerged as a trusted and moderate royal adviser, along with his son George, Lord Digby. At the Council of Peers held at York in September 1640, the King showed an unprecedented willingness to listen to Bristol's criticism of his policy, and agreed to his advice that a Parliament must be summoned.Wedgwood C.V. The King's Peace Wiliam Collins Son and Co. 1955 1641 saw a complete reconciliation between the two men: Bristol with Lord Bedford became leader of the moderate Royalists in the House of Lords, working to achieve a compromise with John Pym, and save the Earl of Strafford's life. After the collapse of the attempt at compromise Bristol came increasingly to be seen as a \\"hardline\\" royalist: as such Parliament imprisoned him after the outbreak of the Civil War, although he was later allowed to join the King at Oxford. After the Battle of Edgehill he was one of the \\"moderate party\\" who persuaded the King not to attempt to take London, which might have brought the war to a swift conclusion. After the King's defeat he moved to Paris and died there in 1653 aged 72.  Character  Clarendon, who knew and liked Bristol, gave this sketch of him:Clarendon, Earl of History of the Great Rebellion \\"Of a grave aspect, of a presence which drew respect, and a very handsome man who by the extraordinary favour of King James to his person was Ambassador to Spain before he was 30. Though he was a man of great parts and a wise man in Council he was passionate and supercilious and was too voluminous in discourse so that he was not considered there with much respect.\\" A modern historian praises him as the greatest servant of the English Crown of his generation, but humorously calls him \\"the terrible earl\\", on account of his hot temper and intimidating personality.Kenyon, J.P. The Stuarts B.T. Batsford 1958  Marriage and progeny  Lord Bristol lived at Sherborne Castle, Dorset. He married Beatrice Walcott (died 1658), widow of Sir John Dyve of Bromham, Bedfordshire, in 1609 and they had three surviving children: *George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol *Mary Digby (1612‚Äì1648), who married as his 2nd wife Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall (1606‚Äì1674). She bore him six sons and one daughter, all of whom died in infancy. She died on 5 November 1648 whilst giving birth to a second daughter stillborn. She was buried in Eggesford Church, Devon, where is situated her memorial effigy.Per monument in Eggesford Church, Devon *John Digby (1618‚Äì1664) Through her previous marriage Lady Bristol was the mother of the prominent Royalist Sir Lewis Dyve.

The club were able to sell the land to the health authority, which almost solely funded the construction of Adams Park. Opening The ground is located in a valley at the end of the Sands Industrial Estate, surrounded by green hills on three sides. Whereas Wycombe's previous Loakes Park ground was very close to the town centre, Adams Park is two miles due west of High Wycombe and less easily accessible either by public or private transport. The stadium was opened in time for the 1990‚Äì91 season, and had a capacity of 6,000 with 1,267 seats in the Main Stand. The ground was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams. Adams had bought the former ground Loakes Park for the club, whose sale financed the move to the stadium named after him. The new stadium coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes as, under manager Martin O'Neill, they won the FA Trophy at Wembley thanks to a 2‚Äì1 win over Kidderminster Harriers. Renovations 1990s The initial licensed capacity of Adams Park was 6,000. This gradually rose as Wycombe Wanderers improved the provision of crush barriers on the terraces. Shortly after entering the Football League for the first time in 1993, these upgrades were completed, taking the capacity to around 9,500. In the summer of 1996 the 4,990-seater Woodlands Stand was built on the hill behind the erstwhile Woodlands Terrace. The Hillbottom Road End, where the visiting fans are accommodated, was seated, reducing its capacity from 2,131 standing spaces to 1,049 seats. The latter development had created problems when large numbers of visiting fans came to the ground, outstripping the supply of seats in that end when sides like Watford, Birmingham City and Manchester City visited. The capacity of the stadium was fixed at 10,000 to comply with council regulations, as the positioning of the stadium on a dead- end road was leading to problems when large crowds were leaving the ground, particularly with parking cars in the streets of the nearby residential suburb of Sands. 2001 In the summer of 2001 the Hillbottom Road End was extended by an extra 977 seats to take its capacity to 2,026. This was done mainly to be able to accommodate more away fans in one place when the need arose. However, the capacity was kept at 10,000 by reducing the official capacity of the standing areas at the Valley End and on the paddock in front of the Main Stand. 2002 In 2002, rugby union team London Wasps (later just known as Wasps), became tenants to Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park after losing their previous groundsharing agreement with Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. 2005 In July 2005, a capacity crowd of 10,000 was registered for the first time, when Premiership champions Chelsea brought team to play Wycombe in a pre-season friendly. It was during this season that the idea that Adams Park would be further expanded was mooted by senior figures at Wycombe Wanderers and Wasps so that it can comply to the Rugby Football Union regulations for Premiership grounds in the future. These stipulated that stadiums would have a capacity of at least 12,000 by 2007/08. It was initially suggested that a stand identical to the Woodlands Stand be built where the Main Stand is currently situated, and options to add additional tiers to the Valley End of the ground were also discussed. These plans, however, never came to fruition, as the RFU's requirement to increase the capacity of the grounds was quietly dropped soon afterwards after a general decline in attendances, as well as the major difficulties that would have arisen from trying to add additional access routes to the stadium. 2013 On 6 March 2013, Adams Park hosted rugby league for the first time after London Broncos were forced to move their game against Bradford to High Wycombe due to pitch problems at their usual home ground the Twickenham Stoop. On 21 March 2013, it hosted an England national under-21 football team international friendly against Romania‚Äôs under-21s with the hosts beat the visitors 3‚Äì0 goals from Wilfried Zaha, Jack Robinson and Nathan Delfouneso with 6,354 in attendance. 2014 On 8 October 2014, it was announced that Wasps would leave Adams Park by December 2014, ending their 12-year ground-share with Wycombe Wanderers. They purchased and moved to the larger Ricoh Arena in Coventry. New name In 2003 the stadium was renamed the Causeway Stadium. For ¬£100,000 over three years, local technology company Causeway bought the naming rights to the ground. This caused some anger amongst fans as the ground was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams. Adams had bought the former ground Loakes Park for the club, whose sale financed the move to the stadium named after him. The Causeway Technologies sponsorship expired at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season and the ground name has reverted to Adams Park. New development plans There have been a number of plans to either extend the capacity of Adams Park beyond the current permitted maximum of 10,000 on the current site since Adams Park was opened, or to build a new stadium elsewhere in High Wycombe. 2005 Wycombe District Council outlined long- term plans for the regeneration of the Abbey Barn area of the town. These included a possible 20,000 capacity stadium near the site of the since closed Wycombe Heights dry ski slope. 2006 Plans were drawn up for a new access route to the ground through land owned by the wealthy Dashwood family to the north and west of Adams Park, allowing the expansion of its capacity up to 15,000. Wasps announced proposals to build an additional two tiers of seating on the back of the existing Valley End terrace, with this structure filling in the corner round to the large Woodlands Stand, enclosing that section of the ground. 2006 saw the construction of new club shop and offices. 2007 At a Wycombe Wanderers supporters' forum, CEO and minority shareholder of Wycombe Wanderers, and owner of London Wasps Steve Hayes announced plans to build a new stadium in the High Wycombe area, with a capacity of 17,000 ‚Äì 20,000 and being the first UK stadium in modern times to have terracing. The new stadium would be jointly owned by WWFC, London Wasps and Wycombe District Council. The plans included retail outlets, a hotel and conference facilities. Steve Hayes would later become 100% owner of Wycombe Wanderers in 2008. 2008 The stadium land was taken out of the Green Belt by a Government inspector, meaning the land value rose from ¬£4,000 per acre to ¬£1,000,000 per acre, giving a better resale value if required. The move would also allow additional stands, permanent or temporary, to be constructed to gain the 12,500 capacity required by London Wasps under Guinness Premiership regulations for the coming season. However, the main problem of access still remained, which meant that London Wasps would still be looking to move to a larger stadium. 2011 Steve Hayes, who owned both Wycombe Wanderers F.C. and London Wasps R.U.F.C. at the time, announced his intentions to build a new stadium for both clubs on the site of Wycombe Air Park in Booker, 2¬Ω miles away from Adams Park. His plans encountered large-scale opposition from community groups and Wycombe Wanderers supporters, with concerns ranging from the loss of aeronautical activity at the air park to inappropriate green belt development. There were also objections by many Wycombe Wanderers supporters and Wycombe Wanderers Supporters' Trust who believed the club would not receive the proceeds of the sale of Adams Park (which it owned 100%), but that these would go to Steve Hayes to help finance a 20,000-capacity stadium in conjunction with Wycombe District Council that would then be rented to Wycombe Wanderers. The plans were abandoned in July 2011 when Wycombe District Council decided to end its support of the project in the face of increased scepticism about the viability of the project. Structure PreSonus Stand (North) Looking towards the PreSonus Stand at Adams Park Built in 1990, the stand has a capacity of 1,267, all seated (but spectators may stand in the paddock at the front of this stand if they already have a valid seat ticket). The stand also contains the club offices, changing rooms, club shop and catering facilities. Lords Builders Merchants Stand (East) Originally called the Hillbottom Road End, the east end of the stadium was originally a terrace with a capacity of 2,131 when Adams Park was opened in 1990, almost identical to the Valley End at the opposite end of the ground. Along with the construction of the new Woodlands stand in 1996, 1,047 seats were installed in the Hillbottom Road End.http://www.chairboys.co.uk/onthenet/news/31jan2000-awayend.htm In 2002, the capacity was increased in size to the current 2,053 all-seated capacity, with a space for 10 wheelchairs. Supporters of the visiting team are allocated this stand for Wycombe Wanderers matches. After a number of crowd disturbances from supporters of visiting clubs who had sold out the full allocation of tickets, the licensed capacity of the stand has been reduced to 1,800. The stand has been renamed a number of times after commercial deals - the current official name is the Lords Builders Merchants Stand. Frank Adams Stand (South) Originally a single level terrace, this stand was expanded into a two-tier unit in 1996. When redeveloped in 1996, the stand had a capacity of 4,990 (2,842 in the upper tier, 1,738 plus 50 wheelchair spaces in the lower tier) the South Stand contains boxes for corporate hospitality, with the lower tier designated as the stadium's Family Stand. This side of the ground is also known as the Woodlands side of the ground, but was renamed to its current official name, Frank Adams Stand, to ensure that at least some of stadium would still be named in honour of the former Wycombe Wanderers' captain and benefactor when the stadium was renamed Causeway Stadium between 2003 and 2006. Since the stadium changed its name back to Adams Park, the stand has officially retained the Frank Adams name. In the summer of 2017, the end blocks of the lower tier had a total of 163 seats removed, replaced with a tarpaulin bearing an advertisement for a club sponsor. However in 2018, the club installed 68 '20/20' seats at the empty block nearest to the Valley End. These were installed to showcase a new type of seating accommodation that would allow spectators to stand in front of their seat without blocking someone sitting behind them. The capacity of the stand has been reduced to 4,895 following these changes. BMI Healthcare Terrace (West) BMI Healthcare Terrace at Adams Park Originally called the Valley End, the BMI Healthcare Terrace is the home supporters' end for football matches, and the only remaining standing accommodation in the stadium. The original licensed capacity of the terrace was 2,136; however, this was reduced by the club to 1,717 to maintain a total licensed capacity for the whole stadium of 10,000 after the extension of the Hillbottom Road end by 1,000 seats in 2001.http://www.chairboys.co.uk/onthenet/news/31jan2000-awayend.htm After the Sports Grounds Safety Authority re-evaluated the extent of the viewing area on the Valley End that was permitted to be included in the total capacity calculation in October 2015, the terrace's maximum capacity was provisionally reduced from 2,131 (officially licensed 1,717) to 1,494http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk/news/article/capacity-of-terrace-at- adams-park-reduced-2753858.aspx pending remedial work to be carried out by the club in the near future. Facilities The stadium contains two hospitality suites, the Caledonian Suite, located behind the Beechdean Stand, and the Woodlands Suite, situated on the Executive Box level of the Frank Adams Stand. The ground also contains a bar, called Monty's (named after late club president Monty Seymour), and since 2006 a club shop in the corner of the ground between the Beechdean and Lords Builders Merchants stands.

Plot summary The plot concerns the marriage of Michael Anton and Pauline Barclay, who meet when he tends to her bloodied brow in his family's grocery store, located in a primarily Eastern European enclave in Baltimore, in December 1941. They marry after Michael is discharged from the Army with a permanent injury caused by a deliberate shot from someone he assaulted. Michael and Pauline settle in a small apartment above the store, but their widely different temperaments and expectations quickly create dissension in the relationship. He is repressed, controlling, and quiet; she is loud, emotional, and romantic. At Pauline's insistence, they move to the suburbs, where they raise three children: Lindy, George and Karen. \\"Lindy, who has always been a stubborn, willful child, becomes increasingly defiant as a teenager, and one day, she just leaves home -- and doesn't return. Her disappearance -- like the abrupt, sometimes violent events that occur in many Tyler novels, propelling heretofore passive characters into a re-evaluation of their lives -- does not bring her parents closer together, but instead results in another round of accusations and recriminations.\\" Kakutani, Michiko (January 9, 2004) \\"Books of the Times: He's Stodgy, She's Zany, Till Death Do Them Part,‚Äù New York Times. Lindy runs away to San Francisco in 1960 and becomes involved in the growing drug culture. Eight years later, her parents retrieve Pagan, Lindy's three-year-old son, while Lindy detoxes in a rehab community. \\"The lives of the Antons, of course, are not just about fighting; Pauline and Michael are also tied to each other by their children, by shared adventures and, as the years pass, by bonds of memory and inertia. Caring for aging parents, witnessing the illnesses and travails of friends, adapting to a move to the suburbs -- these are all experiences that bind Pauline and Michael to each other, even as their very different temperaments and interests increasingly pull them apart.\\" The slowly crumbling marriage finally dissolves when Michael leaves Pauline on their 30th anniversary. For Michael, convinced that he and Pauline didn't have the faintest idea what they were doing when they married or how to conduct a marriage (that they were \\"amateurs\\"), divorce is a salvation. For Pauline, it's a tragedy that leaves her in despair. The last third of the novel pursues how Michael, Pauline, and their children deal with moving on with the rest of their lives after the divorce. Michael remarries and Pauline forms new friendships but struggles with loneliness and dealing with day-to-day demands of an older single woman living in a big old house. Reviews Michiko Kakutani wrote in her New York Times review: \\"Though The Amateur Marriage can leave the longtime Tyler fan with the sense that the author is simply reconnoitering territory long ago annexed and mapped out, it is so psychologically detailed that the story as a whole stands as one of her more convincing efforts: an ode to the complexities of familial love, the centripetal and centrifugal forces that keep families together and send their members flying apart, the supremely ordinary pleasures and frustrations of middle-class American life.\\" William H. Pritchard: \\"The Amateur Marriage is...Tyler's most ambitious work, ranging over 60 years of American experience, from the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the anniversary of that day in 2001....An aspect of Tyler's slyness lies in her ability to write sentences that seem to present no resistance, that are perfectly clear in their direction, that don't send up metaphorical gestures by way of suggesting the inexpressibility of life. Yet such writing is beautifully accurate, more often than not with a glinting vein of humor. ...Tyler's grip on her characters and their pathos is similarly mischievous, but its focus is steady and unerring. The book also touches levels deeper than mischief...to spend the last third of the novel demonstrating (as one of the chapter titles has it) that The World Won't End. Tragedy ends after the big mistake has been made and paid for, but comedy goes on its way, devoted to showing how everyone is necessarily mistaken.\\" \\"Unhappily Ever After\\", New York Times (January 11, 2004).

It details the life of Grettir √Åsmundarson, a bellicose Icelandic outlaw. Grettir is ready to fight in this illustration from a 17th-century Icelandic manuscript  Overview  Grettir's saga is considered one of the Sagas of Icelanders (√çslendingas√∂gur), which were written down in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and record stories of events that supposedly took place between the ninth and the eleventh centuries in Iceland. Thorson, Ornolfur. Introduction. The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder, the Penguin Group, 2005, p. ix The manuscript of Grettir's saga was written down some time just before 1400 CE, making it a late addition to the tradition. Thorson, Ornolfur. Introduction. The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder, the Penguin Group, 2005, p. ix The author is unknown but it is believed that his story may have been based on a previous account of Grettir's life written by Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson. Whoever the author was, the author shows an awareness of the Sagas of Icelanders tradition by making references to other sagas and borrowing themes from the larger cultural milieu of the Germanic peoples that appear independently in other texts like the Old English Beowulf. Thorson, Ornolfur. Introduction. The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder, the Penguin Group, 2005, pp. xviii-xxi The saga can be split into three major sections: Chapters 1-13, Chapters 14-85, and Chapters 86-93. The first and last sections of the saga focus on Grettir's family rather than on Grettir. Chapters 1-13 primarily focus on how Grettir‚Äôs viking great- grandfather Onundur Tree-foot escaped Norway to settle in Iceland after fighting in the Battle of Hafrsfjord against the first king of Norway Harald Fairhair. Chapters 14-85 primarily focus on the life, condemnation, and death of Grettir. Chapters 86-93 focus on Grettir‚Äôs half-brother Thorstein Dromund‚Äôs journey to the court of Constantinople to take revenge and, incidentally, find courtly love before spending the latter portion of his life in a monastic cell in Rome. Thorson, Ornolfur. Introduction. The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder, the Penguin Group, 2005, p. xiv Both Grettir's viking/raider great-grandfather and his chivalry practicing half-brother succeed whereas Grettir's quest to become a monster-slaying hero of old results in him becoming an outlaw. Christianity became the religion in Iceland around 1000 CE, and some scholars believe this changing morality explains why Grettir's fate is different than his pagan great-grandfather's before conversion and his pious, Christian half-brother's fate after conversion. Thorson, Ornolfur. Introduction. The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder, the Penguin Group, 2005, p. xvii Originally, the ill- tempered Grettir experienced some success, but his life takes a turn for the worse after he encounters the draugr Glamr in chapter 35. The Story of Grettir the Strong, Ch. 35, trans. by Eir√≠kr Magn√∫sson and Willam Morris (1869). As a result of Glamr's curse, Grettir becomes disastrously unlucky, only grows weaker/never stronger, becomes afraid of the dark, and is doomed to loneliness, becoming an outlaw, and an early death. While in Norway in chapter 38, Grettir accidentally sets fire to a hut, killing its occupants. In chapter 46, the Althing back in the Icelandic Commonwealth votes that Grettir is an outlaw because of the deaths this fire caused. This outlaw status forces Grettir to live on the edge of society and opens him up to being hunted by others. He is repeatedly betrayed by other outlaws and, after living 19 years as an outlaw, he will die a hunted man on the lonely island of Drangey in chapter 82. In chapter 77, it is stated that Grettir would have ceased being an outlaw after 20 years. Story Chapters 1‚Äì13 Chapters 1‚Äì13 take place before Grettir's birth and focus on his father, √Åsmundar, his grandfather, Thorgrim Grey-head, and his great-grandfather √ñnundur. Grettir's great-grandfather √ñnundur had been a viking/raider. In chapter two, √ñnundur lost his leg below the knee and became √ñnundur Tree-foot, while fighting from a ship against the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord. King Harald won the battle and united Norway into one kingdom. In chapter 3, those who fought King Harald fled Norway for Britain and Ireland. At one point, √ñnundur Tree-leg fought a battle against Kjarval, who was king around Dublin. In chapter 7, √ñnundur tree-foot visits southern Norway to assist kin. In chapter 8, he leaves Norway and arrives in Iceland to settle for good in chapter 9. √ñnundur dies and is buried in tumulus in chapter 11, after which the saga's focus shifts to his son Thorgrim Grey-head and his son √Åsmundar Grey-hair. Asmundar fathers Thorstein Dromund while visiting Norway in Chapter 13 and then returns to Iceland. Chapters 14‚Äì85 Grettir's life is told from beginning to end. Chapter 14 describes Grettir's immediate family. √Åsmundar Grey-hair and his wife Asdis have two boys: (1) the eldest brother, Atli, is quiet and gentle, and (2) Grettir, is rebellious, bad-tempered, and mischievous. He is described as red haired, somewhat freckled, and broad around the eyes. They also have two daughters: (3) Thordis and (4) Rannveig. In this chapter, it is stated the Grettir's father did not care for him much but that his mother loved him a lot. It is also revealed that Grettir grew strong and that he has a fondness for poetry. In chapter 16, Grettir receives his first sentence for outlawry. While still very young, Grettir kills a person because he thinks they have taken his food bag. Despite attempts to pay compensation to the family similar to weregild, he is temporarily banished from Iceland and sentenced to lesser-outlawry for three years. He asks his father for a sword before he leaves, which his father refuses, but his mother Asdis gives him family heirloom sword from her familyline in chapter 17. He then leaves for Norway for the first time. In chapter 18, Grettir fights his first creature, an undead man, Kar, guarding treasure in his own funeral mound/tumulus. Treasures and weapons are taken from the mound after Grettir's triumph. He has other successful adventures in Norway as well, killing bears and berserkers. He then has to flee Norway to go back to Iceland after he kills people for an insult in chapters 23 and 24. Grettir comes back to Iceland. In Chapters 32-33 a Swedish, pagan shepherd named Gl√°mr is asked to watch sheep, but disappears on Yule/ Christmas eve. He is seen dead the next day in the snow and then Glamr will become a draugr that haunts the area. Grettir will fight and successfully slay Glamr in chapter 35. The Story of Grettir the Strong, Ch. 35, trans. by Eir√≠kr Magn√∫sson and Willam Morris (1869). Glamr's curse is what leads Grettir in a different direction. As a result of Glamr's curse, Grettir becomes disastrously unlucky, only grows weaker/never stronger, becomes afraid of the dark, and is doomed to loneliness, becoming an outlaw, and an early death. While in Norway for the second time in chapter 38, Grettir will accidentally kill a hut full of people by unintentionally lighting it on fire. His older brother, Atli at the family farm will get killed by a man named Thorbjorn in chapter 45. In chapter 46, the Althing back in the Icelandic Commonwealth votes that Grettir is an outlaw because of the deaths the fire caused. Grettir returns home to Iceland the following chapter, 47, to learn this information for the first time. This outlaw status forces Grettir to live on the edge of society and opens him up to being hunted by others and being betrayed by other outlaws. Grettir lives in various places running from enemies and slaying more monsters. In Chapter 69 he returns home to the farm at Bjarg and sees his mother. She sends him off with his 15 year old brother Illugi and they head off to spend the rest of the saga on the island of Drangey off the northern tip of Iceland. Part of the reason for this if that the island has steep cliffs and can only be climbed up on with the help of a ladder than can be withdrawn. Grettir eventually becomes the longest-surviving outlaw in Icelandic history. After spending over 19 years as an outlaw, his friends and family ask for his banishment to be lifted, arguing that a man could not spend more than 20 years as an outlaw according to the law (in fact, there was no such law in medieval Iceland). In chapter 77, after a debate at the assembly, it is decided that the outlawry will be lifted when he has completed the 20 years but not before. His enemies make one last effort, using sorcery to cause him to wound himself and finally defeat him, atop the cliff-sided, lonely, fortress-like Drangey off the northern tip of Iceland where he was staying with another brother of his named Illugi, and his slave Glaumur. Grettir's enemies succeed in killing him in chapter 82. Assuming that the tales of the saga bear any relationship to historical realities, Grettir would have died 'some time between 1030 and 1040'.The Saga of Grettir the Strong, trans. by G. A. High, ed. by Peter Foote, Everyman's Library, 699, repr. (London: Dent, 1965), p. v. Chapters 86‚Äì93 His half-brother, Thorsteinn Dromund, later avenges him in a semi- comic scene in Byzantium/Constantinople, where the Norse served as Varangians.The Story of Grettir the Strong, Ch. 84, trans. by Eir√≠kr Magn√∫sson and Willam Morris (1869). While in Constantinople, he falls in love with a married woman named Spes, who helps him. After Thorsteinn Dromund completes his mission the two of them decide to spend the rest of their lives in monastic cells in Rome. Legacy Grettir √Åsmundarson was reported to have been from Bjarg in Mi√∞fj√∂r√∞ur. At Bjarg, Grettir √Åsmundarson always had refuge with his mother √Åsd√≠s. Many place names in the neighbourhood of Bjarg and indeed throughout the county bear the name of the outlaw e.g. Grettishaf, Grettistak and Grettish√∂f√∞i at Arnarvatn. Even Garfield is named Grettir in Iceland: because he is rufous, a little broad and unwilling to conform to society's norms. A memorial was erected to his mother √Åsd√≠s at Bjarg in 1974. The memorial displays a relief from Grettis Saga made by Icelandic artist Halld√≥r P√©tursson. Grettir is celebrated in the long poem Eclogue from Iceland in the 1938 collection The Earth Compels by Irish poet Louis MacNeice, who had developed a love of Norse mythology while at school at Marlborough College. In it, the ghost of Grettir speaks with two men, Craven and Ryan, who have been 'hounded' from a decadent and war-threatened Europe 'whose voice calls in the sirens of destroyers'. He urges them to recover their underlying human values, and to assert, as he has, 'the sanctity of the individual will'. He tells them to return home as an act of duty, which he calls - remembering his own defiant choice to be an outlaw - 'Your hazard, your act of defiance and hymn of hate, hatred of hatred, assertion of human values' and (in the poem's final words') 'your only chance'. The Australian composer Percy Grainger described the Grettis Saga as the \\"strongest single artistic influence\\" in his life. The saga was adapted in 2017 as the basis for a novel set in Sheffield by Tony Williams (author).Tony Williams, Nutcase (Salt, 2017), (UK edition).

Latour lies at the very southeastern tip of the commune of Pauillac in the M√©doc region to the north-west of Bordeaux, at its border with Saint-Julien, and only a few hundred metres from the banks of the Gironde estuary. The estate produces three red wines in all. In addition to its Grand vin (LWIN 1012316), Latour has also produced the second wine Les Forts de Latour (LWIN 1010309) since 1966, and a third wine, simply named Pauillac (LWIN 1013821), has been released every year since 1989. An imp√©riale (six-litre bottle) of Ch√¢teau Latour sold for ¬£135,000 in 2011. History A bottle of 2003 Ch√¢teau Latour The site has been occupied since at least 1331 when Tor √† Saint-Lambert was built by Gaucelme de Castillon, and the estate dating to at least 1378. A garrison fort was built 300 metres from the estuary to guard against attack during the Hundred Years' War. The tower, the name mutating with time to La Tour en Saint-Mambert and Saint-Maubert, gave its name to the estate around the fortress and was in English hands until the Battle of Castillon in 1453, and its complete destruction by the forces of the King of France. The original tower no longer exists, but in the 1620s a circular tower (La Tour de Saint- Lambert) was built on the estate named after Simon Ledwidge and though it is actually designed as a pigeon roost, it remains a strong symbol of the vineyard. Though two centuries apart, this building is said to have been constructed using the original edifice. Vines have existed on the site since the 14th century, and Latour's wine received some early recognition, discussed as early as in the 16th century in Essays by Montaigne. Near the end of the 16th century, the estate's several smallholdings had been accumulated by the de Mullet family into one property. From 1670 began a lineage of connected family ownership not broken until 1963, when the estate was acquired by the de Chavannes family, and passed by marriage to the de Clauzel family in 1677. When Alexandre de S√©gur married Marie-Th√©r√®se de Clauzel, Latour became a part of his vast property, to which he also added Ch√¢teau Lafite in 1716, just prior to his death. In 1718 his son Nicolas-Alexandre de S√©gur added Ch√¢teau Mouton and Ch√¢teau Calon-S√©gur to his holdings and began producing wines of great quality. The widespread reputation of Latour emerged at the beginning of the 18th century when its status was established on export markets such as England, alongside chateaux Lafite, Margaux and Pontac. With the death of Nicolas-Alexandre S√©gur in 1755 the estate was divided among four daughters, three of whom inherited Latour in 1760, and with absent landlords, Latour was managed by a regisseur charged with efficient administration and thorough correspondence with the owners. Receiving more care than under the late owner whose favourite had been Lafite, Latour improved in the later half of the century, and later became a favourite of Thomas Jefferson, then minister to France, when he categorised La Tour de S√©gur as a vineyard of first quality in 1787. With the onset of the French Revolution, the property became divided. The Comte de S√©gur-Cabanac fled France and his portion was auctioned off by the state in 1794, passing through several owners. The estate was not reunited until 1841, when the family succeeded in a plot to put the estate up for sale, and eventually emerged after an auction having regained the 20% shares owned by n√©gociants Barton, Guestier and Johnston. The Soci√©t√© Civile de Ch√¢teau Latour was formed in 1842, exclusive to the family, who then had become shareholders. Ahead of the International Exhibition in Paris, the selection of Latour as one of the four First Growths in the Classification of 1855 consolidated its reputation, and ensured its high prices. The present ch√¢teau was completed in 1864. Modern history Ch√¢teau Latour presentation card dated 1931, demonstrating the designs of the early 20th century, the label, cork, case and capsule markings In 1963 the estate finally left the S√©gur family, then named de Beaumont, when the heirs sold three-quarters of the Ch√¢teau Latour shares to the British interests of the Pearson Group under control of Lord Cowdray, with shares owned by Harvey's of Bristol. Henri Martin and Jean-Paul Gard√®re were appointed as managers which brought about substantial innovations. Investments were made in research, vineyards were expanded by acquisition and replanting, the chai was extended and Latour became the first of the first growths to modernise their whole production, replacing the old oak fermenting vats with stainless steel temperature- controlled vats. The second wine with fruit from younger vines was initiated, and fruit for the grand vin was decided to come exclusively from the vineyards shown on the plan of the domain from 1759. Martin and Gard√®re formally resigned from the Conseil d'Administration in 1987, ending a 24-year era. In 1989 Latour was purchased by Allied Lyons for around ¬£110 million, but in 1993 returned to French ownership when bought by businessman Fran√ßois Pinault for ¬£86 million when it became part of his holding company Groupe Artemis. In December 2008 it was reported that the investment bank Lazard was offering the estate for sale. The Sunday Times speculated that among the interested parties were wine mogul Bernard Magrez, with actors G√©rard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, in a transaction which would bring one of the five first growths under the control of a resident Bordelais for the first time in several decades. Production The estate has of vineyard, of which a portion near the ch√¢teau is named l'Enclos, where fruit exclusive to the grand vin is grown. The composition of grape varieties is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and 2% of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The grand vin Chateau Latour, typically a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, with the remainder Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, normally has an annual production of 18,000 cases. The second wine Les Forts de Latour, typically 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, has an average annual production of 11,000 cases. Beginning in 1989, the estate began producing a third wine, Pauillac de Latour.  Price  The estate's grand vin is one of the most expensive Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot wines made in the M√©doc region and retails at an average price of $793 for a 750 ml bottle.

She was named after the Polish word for Thunderbolt, while her sister ship translates to lightning. Design Grom was thought of as a large destroyer, similar to flotilla leaders. She and sister ship ORP B≈Çyskawica were to support the outdated French-built and in the role of the core of the Polish Navy in a possible conflict. As Poland had only one major seaport, the main task of the Polish naval forces was to secure supplies shipment to and from allied countries. Because of that, the Grom class was designed to fulfill both the role of shore defence and convoy escort and was supposed to be stronger than single enemy destroyers. Two Parsons steam turbines of altogether, three boilers and two shafts allowed Grom to travel at , faster than the contemporary designs like the US and es, the British , or the German s. Also, as it was not clear whether the ships would be used to secure convoys to the Polish port of Gdynia or the Romanian port of Constan≈£a (through the Romanian Bridgehead), the possible range was much larger than in the case of destroyers designed exclusively for the Baltic Sea. The ship had an effective range of at . Construction and career Grom was ordered from the British J. Samuel White shipyard in Cowes and was laid down in 1935. The destroyer was commissioned in 1937. On 30 August 1939, the Polish destroyers , , and Grom were ordered to activate the Peking Plan, and the warships headed for Great Britain, from where they were to operate as convoy escorts. On 1 September 1939, Polish destroyers met with the British destroyers and . The British ships led the Polish flotilla to Leith, and in the night the Polish destroyers came to Rosyth. During her operations in the Norwegian Campaign, Grom was ranked by the German soldiers as probably the most hated of all the Allied ships deployed to the area. This hatred was founded on the fact that Grom took an intense interest in all hostile movements on shore and was reputed to spend hours lurking the coast in order to harass German forces. On 4 May 1940, Grom carried out what turned out to be the last of her many naval gunfire support missions in the Narvik area in the Rombaken fjord. She was attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Kampfgeschwader 100 (piloted by Lt. Korthals). Grom was hit by two bombs and sank after internal explosion. The wreck was never raised and it was not until 6 October 1986 that it was explored by divers for the first time.

Biography Jacques Ozanam was born in Sainte- Olive, Ain, France. In 1670, he published trigonometric and logarithmic tables more accurate than the existing ones of Ulacq, Pitiscus, and Briggs. An act of kindness in lending money to two strangers brought him to the attention of M. d'Aguesseau, father of the chancellor, and he secured an invitation to settle in Paris. There he enjoyed prosperity and contentment for many years. He married, had a large family, and derived an ample income from teaching mathematics to private pupils, chiefly foreigners. His mathematical publications were numerous and well received. R√©cr√©ations (published 1694) was later translated into English and is well known today. He was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences in 1701. The death of his wife plunged him into deep sorrow, and the loss of his foreign pupils through the War of the Spanish Succession reduced him to poverty. He died in Paris on April 3, 1718 (frequently cited as 1717 because of an error in \\"√©loge de Fontenelle\\"). Ozanam was honoured more abroad than at home. He was devout, charitable, courageous, and of simple faith. As a young man he had overcome a passion for gambling. He was wont to say that it was for the doctors of the Sorbonne to dispute, for the pope to decide, and for a mathematician to go to heaven in a perpendicular line. He also taught Abraham de Moivre.

It is the third video game in the Mega Man Zero series of Mega Man video games. In February 2020, the game was released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam as part of the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. Plot Two months following Zero's victory over Elpizo, the Dark Elf remains at large. During this time, Ciel has finished her research on a new energy supply to end the crisis, dubbed the \\"Ciel System\\". While en route to Neo Arcadia to propose the Ciel System in hopes of ending the conflict and the genocide of Reploids, a spaceship with the Dark Elf's energy reading crashes to Earth. Zero sets out to investigate, but instead finds the remaining Guardians (Harpuia, Fefnir, and Leviathan) fighting against a gigantic Reploid named Omega and a scientist named Dr. Weil ‚Äî both who were banished to space due to their crimes in instigating the Elf Wars and turning the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf a century prior. Dr. Weil reveals he has resurrected Copy X, who resumes his rule over Neo Arcadia, much to Harpuia's chagrin. The Guardians, suspecting that Copy X is being heavily influenced by Dr. Weil, defect from Neo Arcadia. Zero and Dr. Weil go their separate ways in search of the Dark Elf. The Dark Elf appears in a human residential district in Neo Arcadia, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to launch a missile in order to incapacitate it. Although successful in capturing the Dark Elf, the incident kills thousands of humans. Following this event, Ciel rescinds her offer of the Ciel System, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to brand the Resistance as Mavericks and subsequently launch an invasion against them. The Resistance is able to delay the invasion until Zero locates Copy X. During the ensuing battle, Copy X is betrayed and killed by Dr. Weil, who declares himself the new ruler of Neo Arcadia and announces his true intention for capturing the Dark Elf: to fuse it with Omega and link them with a frequency transmitter that would enable Omega to control the minds of every Reploid on Earth. Zero confronts and defeats Omega, who reveals his true form: a body that looks exactly like Zero. Dr. Weil reveals that while Zero was powered down during his 100-year hibernation, he had transferred Zero's conscience and memories to a copy body and stole Zero's original body to be used by Omega due to its unmatched fighting abilities. Despite this revelation, Zero and the Guardians destroy his original body, killing Omega for good. Omega's death results in a massive explosion, which frees the Dark Elf from Dr. Weil's corruption, but kills Harpuia, Fefnir and Leviathan. While Zero is unconscious, X appears and tells Zero that it's up to him to protect the Earth and defeat Dr. Weil. Finally out of power, X vanishes forever. The Dark Elf, known as the Mother Elf once more, delivers Zero to the Resistance Base before flying away. Gameplay This game follows almost exactly the same rules as its predecessor, Mega Man Zero 2. Once again, Zero has his Z-Saber, Buster, and Shield Boomerang. However, Zero's rod weapon (originally the Triple Rod in Mega Man Zero and the Chain Rod in Mega Man Zero 2) has been replaced with the Recoil Rod: a pair of tonfa-like weapons that can be aimed in all directions. When charged up, a powerful stabbing attack is performed, which can knock enemies back, or propel Zero into the air if aimed down to the ground, like a makeshift pogo stick. The Cyber Elf system has been given an overhaul with the introduction of Satellite Cyber Elves. These are different from the standard Cyber Elves, which have been renamed \\"Fusion Elves\\", in that they are equipped for a constant benefit, and the use of them will not affect the mission ranking score. However, only two Satellite Elves can be equipped at once. Cyberspace is a new addition to the game. It is said by one Resistance Member (Hirondelle) that the portal to Cyberspace opened up due to Omega's arrival. Going through the door to Cyberspace leads the player into an area that looks exactly like the one in which they left but with a green tinge to it. Enemy appearances are less frequent and if a transfer of info from a Mega Man Battle Network 4/Mega Man Zero 3 link has been performed, certain virus enemies from the Battle Network Series will appear. All enemies drop health items (instead of other items, such as Secret Disks) in Cyberspace. Entering the Cyberspace causes certain Cyber Elves (both Fusion and Satellite, the ones with the A-mark on the lower left) to auto-activate without dying, even if not grown enough to be normally used, and these Elves do not affect the score. However, going into Cyberspace decreases the mission ranking score, making it more difficult to obtain an S or A Rank, which is needed in order to win EX Skills of the end-of-stage bosses. Zero no longer needs to \\"level up\\" in order to create weapon combos as they are already in place. Secret Disks Throughout the game, enemies may drop Secret Disks, which may contain information about the Mega Man Zero series, enemy information, Cyber Elves, energy capsules, energy crystals or even customization chips. Most of the disks can be opened by Zero himself, mostly those containing Cyber Elves, but the others are locked and the player will have to take them to Cerveau in order to open them. Once opened, their info will be stored in a Secret Disk library featured within the game. Customization Chips The Forms system from Mega Man Zero 2 has been replaced with Customization Chips. These can be found in Secret Disks and come in three types‚Äîhead, body and legs. Only one of each type of chip can be equipped at a time, which gives the player more flexibility in customizing Zero. These Chips give direct upgrades to Zero's head, body or legs, and can be used to reproduce the effects of the various Forms that Zero could take in Mega Man Zero 2. As with the Forms in this game's predecessor, Zero can take on different colours when different body chips are equipped. Extras As with other Mega Man Zero games, beating the game will allow playing the completed save file again in a \\"New Game+\\". Zero will start with all Fusion Elves used from the previous game still in effect (although he will still be penalized for their use), and will also get to keep any EX Skills and body chips that he earned in the previous game. Hard Mode can be unlocked after completing the game once. It can be accessed by pressing the L shoulder button before pressing Start while selecting a New Game. In Hard Mode, Cyber Elves cannot be used and Cyberspace cannot be accessed (save for one specific level). Zero's triple-slash and full-charge shot are also disabled, and he cannot earn EX Skills. Ultimate mode can be unlocked by collecting all of the Secret Disks in one game and beating it. Hold R when starting a New Game to play. In Ultimate Mode, Zero starts with all Fusion Elves with permanent effects (such as the Elves that extend the life meter) already in use and without penalty in mission scores. Zero will also have a few body parts available from the start, including the Ultima Foot chip. Finally, Zero can use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos. There are also seven mini games that can be selected from on the game's Start Menu. They are all unlocked after certain criteria have been met: *Zero mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game once. *Copy X mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game on Hard Mode. *Ciel mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game with an overall S-rank at the final stage. *Fefnir mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game with an average of 100 points at the final stage. *Leviathan mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game with an average of 100 points at the final stage. *Phantom mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game without attacking with any weapons other than the Buster Shot (you can still use them, just don't hit any enemies with them; e.g. You can still use Recoil Rod for pushing blocks or the jump boost, for example), and with an overall S-Rank. *Harpuia mini-game ‚Äì Beat the game without attacking with any weapons other than the Z-Saber (you can still use them, just don't hit any enemies with them; e.g. You can still use Recoil Rod for pushing blocks or the jump boost, for example), and with an overall S-Rank. Reception Mega Man Zero 3 was the fourth best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release. It was the 106th best-selling game in the country for 2004 at 121,847 units sold. A common comment made by reviews of the game is that Mega Man Zero 3 is similar to its predecessors and has not changed much in terms of gameplay. Reviewers complain often about the difficulty level of this game's predecessors and were quick to praise the game's difficulty level for being more forgiving but still challenging.

It followed the Millers River, Deerfield River and crossed the Hoosac Range, in the area that is now northwestern Massachusetts. Today the Mohawk Trail is a part of Routes 2 and 2A. It follows much of the original Indian trail, from Westminster, Massachusetts to Williamstown, Massachusetts, for about , and passes through the communities of Orange, Erving, Gill, Greenfield, Shelburne, Buckland, Charlemont, Savoy, Florida and North Adams. The Berkshire mountains are clearly visible from several points. The modern day Mohawk Trail is considered one of the most beautiful drives in Massachusetts. There are numerous points of interest along the way, including many scenic viewpoints, roadside attractions and gift shops.The Berkshire Hills & Pioneer Valley - Chritina Tree & William Davis - Countryman Press 2011 Of particular note is Hail to the Sunrise at Mohawk Park, a statue made in tribute to Native American heritage. A portion of the trail parallels the Deerfield River for several miles, and passes through the village of Shelburne Falls, and the Bridge of Flowers. The route crosses the Connecticut River via the historic French King Bridge at a height of 140 feet. The road reaches a high elevation of 2272 feet at Whitcomb Summit. On the western side of the summit there is the popular hairpin turn and lookout, overlooking the city of North Adams and the Taconic Mountains. On the eastern side, the highway descends steeply eastward from Whitcomb Summit down the slope of the Hoosac Range following the Cold River to the Deerfield River. Notable features include the infamous Dead Man's Curve. A six-mile section of the Mohawk Trail was severely damaged by Hurricane Irene in August 2011. A considerable portion of the road is surrounded by the Mohawk Trail State Forest, a forest, known for its camping, and occasional encounters with bobcats and black bears. Within this area there is substantial acreage of old growth forest containing many of the tallest trees in Massachusetts as verified by the Eastern Native Tree Society. The route passes close to Vermont's southern border, and alternate routes travel north into Vermont to Harriman Reservoir and Ball Mountain State Park. The western terminus in Williamstown provides access to Mount Greylock, U.S. Route 7, and New York State Route 2. A portion of the historic footpath route, running through Florida, Savoy, and Charlemont, from the confluence of the Cold and Deerfield Rivers up the Cold River valley to Wheeler Brook, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 1973. This route, where the footpath itself is no longer extant in original form, is located on the north bank of the Cold River, with the modern roadway running along the south bank included in the listed area as an intrusion on the setting.

Shalamar's classic line- up on the SOLAR label-consisted of Howard Hewett, Jody Watley, and Jeffrey Daniel. It was originally a disco-driven vehicle created by Soul Train booking agent Dick Griffey and show creator and producer Don Cornelius. They went on to be an influential dance trio, masterminded by Cornelius. As noted in the British Hit Singles & Albums, they were regarded as fashion icons and trendsetters, and helped to introduce \\"body-popping\\" to the United Kingdom. Their collective name, \\"Shalamar\\", was picked by Griffey. Career The first hit credited to Shalamar was \\"Uptown Festival\\" (1977), which was recorded at Ike & Tina Turner's studio Bolic Sound in 1976. It was released on Soul Train Records. Its success inspired Griffey and Don Cornelius to replace session singers with popular Soul Train dancers Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, to join original Shalamar lead singer Gary Mumford. Gerald Brown took over the spot vacated by Mumford for the group's second album, Disco Gardens (1978), which featured the hit \\"Take That to the Bank\\". After conflicts over lack of payment from Griffey and SOLAR (short for Sound of Los Angeles Records), Brown left the group. Howard Hewett replaced Brown in 1979. The group was joined up with producer Leon Sylvers III in 1979, signed with SOLAR, and scored a US million seller with \\"The Second Time Around\\" (1979). The classic line up of Hewett, Watley and Daniel would be the most successful. In the UK, the group had a string of hits with songs such as \\"Take That to the Bank\\" (1978), \\"I Owe You One\\" (1980), and songs from the Friends (1982) album: \\"I Can Make You Feel Good\\" (1982), \\"A Night to Remember\\", \\"There It Is\\", and the title track \\"Friends\\". The album, which crossed the genres of pop, disco, and soul, was also a big seller in the UK in 1982. The band's record sales in the UK increased when Daniel demonstrated his body-popping dancing skills on BBC Television's music programme, Top of the Pops, which had premiered the Moonwalk on television for the first time. Michael Jackson was a fan of Shalamar, in particular, Daniel and his dance moves, after watching him on Soul Train. Jackson and Daniel met afterward, and Jackson took his then 12-year-old sister Janet to see Shalamar perform at Disneyland. Daniel and Jackson co-choreographed Jackson's \\"Bad\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" videos from the album Bad (1987). The \\"classic\\" lineup of Shalamar (Hewett, Watley, and Daniel) scored a total of five Gold albums in the US with Big Fun (1979), Three for Love (1980) - which eventually went Platinum - Friends (1982) which also went Platinum, The Look (1983), and Heartbreak (1984). The group took a knock when Watley and Daniel separately left the band over conflicts within the group, and other issues with Dick Griffey and SOLAR. Adding to Watley's impetus to depart was her increasing frustration with Griffey and SOLAR, shortly after the release of their next album, The Look (1983). Nonetheless, the album yielded a number of UK hit singles, including \\"Disappearing Act\\", the Grammy nominated \\"Dead Giveaway\\", and \\"Over and Over\\". The album itself moved Shalamar into a more new wave/synthpop direction, with rock guitars to the fore. But The Look generally was not the success that Friends had been the previous year. With a mid 1980s line-up change, adding Micki Free and Delisa Davis, Shalamar returned to the US Top 20 in 1984 with \\"Dancing in the Sheets\\" (1984) from the Footloose soundtrack. The song peaked at #17, and the group won a Grammy for Don't Get Stopped In Beverly Hills from Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack (1984) in 1984. In 1985, Kool & the Gang, Midnight Star, Shalamar and Klymaxx performed at the Marriott Convention Center in Oklahoma City. That year Hewett departed to begin his successful solo career, and was replaced by Sydney Justin. Following Hewett's departure, the band began to lose popularity; Circumstantial Evidence (1987) did not sell well, and the band broke up shortly after Wake Up (1990) was released. Reunions In 1996, Watley rejoined with Hewett and Daniel, plus LL Cool J, on Babyface's million- selling single \\"This Is for the Lover in You\\"; a cover of a hit single from Shalamar's platinum album Three for Love (1980). A music video was shot in which the three former members of Shalamar were digitally reunited on screen. Hewett, Watley, and Daniel subsequently joined Babyface and LL Cool J to perform the song on the UK's Top of the Pops in 1996. They are credited on this single release under their individual names; however, it marked the classic trio's first and only live performance together since 1983. In 1999, Howard Hewett and Jeffrey Daniel reformed Shalamar and played in Japan. This was followed by UK tours in 2000, 2001, and 2003. From 2003, Shalamar continued touring with the line up of Howard Hewett, Jeffrey Daniel, and Carolyn Griffey. In 2005, this lineup appeared on the UK television series, Hit Me, Baby, One More Time, with original members Daniel and Hewett, and with Carolyn Griffey (a long-time friend and fan of the original band's, and daughter of Dick Griffey). Carolyn's mother is Carrie Lucas, for whom Watley sang backing vocals. Shalamar reached the grand finale of Hit Me, Baby, One More Time in May 2005, ultimately losing out to Shakin' Stevens. This was followed by annual concert tours in the UK, Cannes, USA, Nigeria, and Japan. Shalamar was featured in an episode of TV One's series Unsung, in which Watley, Daniel, and Hewett shared their stories about the group's creation, the lack of payments and royalties from SOLAR, success, egos, and the breakup of the classic lineup. Dick Griffey, Micki Free, Delisa Davis, and Sydney Justin were also interviewed for the episode. In October 2009, the reconstituted Shalamar of Hewett, Daniel, and Griffey, performed as a part of \\"The Ultimate Boogie Nights Disco Concert Series\\", at IndigO2, within O2 Arena Entertainment Avenue in London. This prompted their return to the UK in April 2010 for a tour. Shalamar returned to IndigO2 in October 2011, December 2012, December 2013 and December 2014. Shalamar performed a series of eight UK tour dates in April 2015 and another tour of four UK dates in July 2015. As of July 2018 the European Intellectual Property Office certified ownership of the Shalamar Trade mark back to the ownership of the Griffey family. Carrie Lucas and Carolyn Griffey, wife and daughter of Shalamar creator Dick Griffey, officially own all licensing across the 28 countries of Europe.

He founded with fellow students the Conference of Charity, later known as the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.Brodrick, James (1933). Frederic Ozanam and His Society. London: Burns, Oats & Washbourne, Ltd. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris in 1997, hence he may be properly called Blessed Frederic by Catholics. His feast day is 9 September. Life Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam was born on Friday, 23 April 1813, to Jean and Marie Ozanam.Derum, James P. (1960). Apostle in a Top Hat; the Life of Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam. Garden City, N.Y.: Hanover House. He was the fifth of Jean and Marie Ozanam‚Äôs 14 children, one of only three to reach adulthood. His family, which was of Jewish origin,Hosanna!: Blessed Frederic Ozanam: Family and Friends By Ronald Ramson, Rev Ronald Ramson CM, p.7 had been settled in the region around Lyon, France, for many centuries. An ancestor of Fr√©d√©ric, Jacques Ozanam (1640‚Äì1717), was a noted mathematician. Jean Ozanam, Fr√©d√©ric's father, had served in the armies of the First French Republic, but with the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the founding of the First French Empire, he turned to trade, to teaching, and finally to medicine. Ozanam was born in Milan, but brought up in Lyon. In his youth he experienced a period of doubt regarding the Catholic faith, during which he was strongly influenced by one of his teachers at the Coll√®ge de Lyon, the priest Abb√© Noirot. His religious instincts showed themselves early, and in 1831 he published R√©flexions sur la Doctrine de Saint-Simon, a pamphlet against Saint-Simonianism, which attracted the attention of the French poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine who was born in the area. Ozanam also found time to help organize and write for the Association for the Propagation of the Faith, a lay Catholic organization founded in the city with the aim of supporting Catholic missionaries, many of which came from the area. That autumn he went to study law in Paris, where he suffered a great deal from homesickness. Ozanam fell in with the Amp√®re family (living for a time with the mathematician Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re), and through them with other prominent liberal Catholics of the time, such as Count Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert. While still a student, Ozanam took up journalism and contributed considerably to Bailly's Tribune catholique, which became L'Univers, a French Catholic daily newspaper that adopted a strongly ultramontane position. Ozanam and his friends revived a discussion group called a \\"Society of Good Studies\\" and formed it into a \\"Conference of History\\" which quickly became a forum for large and lively discussions among students. Their attentions turned frequently to the social teachings of the Gospel. At one meeting during a heated debate in which Ozanam and his friends were trying to prove from historical evidence alone the truth of the Catholic Church as the one founded by Christ, their adversaries declared that, though at one time the Church was a source of good, it no longer was. One voice issued the challenge, \\"What is your church doing now? What is she doing for the poor of Paris? Show us your works and we will believe you!\\" As a consequence, in May 1833 Ozanam and a group of other young men founded the charitable Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which already by the time of his death numbered upwards of 2,000 members. The founding members developed their method of service under the guidance of Sister Rosalie Rendu, a member of the Congregation of Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, who was prominent in serving the poor in the slums of Paris. The members of the conferences collaborated with Rendu during the time of the cholera epidemic. When fear had gripped the population, she organized the conferences in all the neighborhoods of Paris to care for the cholera victims, becoming well known in the city for her work, especially in the 12th arrondissement. Frederic's first act of charity was to take his supply of winter firewood and bring it to a widow whose husband had died of cholera. Ozanam received the degrees of Bachelor of Laws in 1834, Bachelor of Arts in 1835 and Doctor of Laws in 1836. His father, who had wanted him to study law, died on 12 May 1837. Although he preferred literature, Ozanam worked in the legal profession in order to support his mother, and was admitted to the Bar in Lyon in 1837. Still, he also pursued his personal interest, and in 1839 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Letters with a thesis on Dante that then formed the basis of Ozanam's best-known books. A year later he was appointed to a professorship of commercial law at Lyon, and in 1840, at the age of twenty-seven, assistant professor of foreign literature at the Sorbonne. He decided to give a course of lectures on German Literature in the Middle Ages and in preparation for it went on a short tour of Germany. His lectures proved highly successful despite the fact that he attached fundamental importance to Christianity as the primary factor in the growth of European civilization, unlike his predecessors and most of his colleagues, who shared in the predominantly anti-Christian climate of the Sorbonne at that time. In June 1841, he married Am√©lie Soulacroix, daughter of the rector of the University of Lyon,Delany, Selden P. (1935). \\"Frederic Ozanam (1813-1853).\\" In: Married Saints. New York: Longmans, Green Company, pp. 269‚Äì290. and the couple travelled to Italy for their honeymoon. They had a daughter, Marie. Candelas describes Ozanam as \\" ... a man of great faith. He valued friendships and defended his friends no matter what the cost. He was attentive to details, perhaps to the extreme. ... [H]e showed a great tenderness when dealing with his family. ...He had a great reverence for his parents, and revealed his ability to sacrifice his career and his profession in order to please them. Upon the death in 1844 of Claude Charles Fauriel, Ozanam succeeded to the full professorship of foreign literature at the Sorbonne. The remainder of his short life was extremely busy, attending to his duties as a professor, his extensive literary activities, and the work of district-visiting as a member of the society of St. Vincent de Paul. During the French Revolution of 1848, of which he took a sanguine view, he once more turned journalist by writing, for a short time, in various papers, including the √àre nouvelle (\\"New Era\\"), which he had founded. He traveled extensively, and visited England at the time of the Exhibition of 1851. Death His naturally weak constitution fell prey to consumption, which he hoped to cure by visiting Italy, but on his return to France he died in Marseille on Thursday, 8 September 1853, at the age of 40. He was buried in the crypt of the church of St. Joseph des Carmes at the Institut Catholique in Paris. Works Bust of Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam. Ozanam \\"is recognized as a precursor of the Catholic Church's social doctrine, whose cultural and religious origins he wanted to know and on which he wrote books which are still in great demand.\\" He was more learned, more sincere, and more logical than Chateaubriand; and less of a political partisan and literary sentimentalist than Montalembert. In contemporary movements, he was an earnest and conscientious advocate of Catholic democracy and of the view that the Church should adapt itself to the changed political conditions consequent to the French Revolution.Eveline, Sister M. (1941). \\"The Social Thought of Frederic Ozanam,\\" The American Catholic Sociological Review, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 46‚Äì56. He denounced the old alliance of \\"Throne and Altar\\" and pleaded with the Pope to adopt more liberal positions. He advocated the separation of church and state as conducive to liberty, and he was frequently impugned by reactionaries who accused him of deserting the Church. In his writings he dwelt upon important contributions of historical Christianity, and maintained especially that, in continuing the work of the Caesars, the Catholic Church had been the most potent factor in civilizing the invading barbarians and in organizing the life of the Middle Ages. He confessed that his object was to prove the contrary thesis to Edward Gibbon, and, although the aim of proving theses is perhaps not the ideal approach for a historian, Ozanam no doubt administered a healthful antidote to the prevalent notion, particularly amongst English- speaking peoples, that the Catholic Church had done far more to enslave than to elevate the human mind. His knowledge of medieval literature and his appreciative sympathy with medieval life admirably qualified him for his work, and his scholarly attainments are still highly esteemed. His works were published in eleven volumes (Paris, 1862‚Äì1865). They include:  (2nd ed., enlarged 1845)Pychowska, L. D.

They are best known for several hit singles during the 1970s including \\"Car Wash\\", \\"I Wanna Get Next to You\\", \\"I'm Going Down\\", \\"Wishing on a Star\\", and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". Career The Los Angeles-based group comprised Gwen Dickey (vocals), Henry Garner (drums), Terral \\"Terry\\" Santiel (congas), Lequeint \\"Duke\\" Jobe (bass), Michael Moore (saxophone), Kenny Copeland (trumpet, lead vocals), Kenji Brown (guitar, lead vocals), Freddie Dunn (trumpet), and Victor Nix (keyboards). The group began in the early 1970s, when members of several backup bands from the Watts and Inglewood areas of Los Angeles united under the name Total Concept Unlimited. In 1973, this collective toured England and Japan behind Motown soul star Edwin Starr. Starr introduced them to Norman Whitfield.Album notes by A. Scott Galloway, The Very Best of Rose Royce, 2001, Warner Bros. Whitfield, after a decade at Motown, wanted to start a company of his own. He took the T.C.U. octet under his wing and signed them to his label. The group, now called Magic Wand, began working with Yvonne Fair and became the studio and concert band for The Undisputed Truth. During a tour stop in Miami, Undisputed Truth leader Joe Harris noticed a singer named Gwen Dickey, then a member of a local group called The Jewels. Harris informed Whitfield of his discovery and Dickey was flown to Los Angeles to audition. In Dickey, Whitfield found the ingredient he felt was missing in Magic Wand: a charismatic female singer. He gave her the stage name Rose Norwalt. The original band lineup, now complete, prepared their debut album. During this time Whitfield was contacted by film director Michael Schultz, fresh from the success of his first feature, Cooley High. Schultz offered Whitfield the opportunity to score his next picture, Car Wash. Whitfield would use the film to launch his new group and began composing music based on script outlines. He and the band visited the film set, soaking up the atmosphere. This was one of the rare instances in Hollywood in which the music was composed concurrently with the picture instead of after the fact. In the spirit of the soundtrack, the band's name was changed one final time to 'Rose Royce'. The name not only referenced the movie's automotive theme, but it also placed Gwen \\"Rose\\" Dickey front and center. Further, it hinted at a touch of class the band strove to bring to 1970s soul-funk.A. Scott Galloway album notes, The Very Best of Rose Royce, 2001 Warner Bros The movie Car Wash and the soundtrack were great successes, bringing the group national fame. Whitfield won the Best Music award at the Cannes Film Festival, and the album received the Grammy for Best Motion Picture Score Album of the Year. Released in late 1976, the soundtrack featured three Billboard R&B; Top Ten singles: \\"Car Wash,\\" \\"I Wanna Get Next to You,\\" and \\"I'm Going Down.\\" The first of these was also a number one single on the Billboard popular music chart, and \\"I Wanna Get Next to You\\" reached number 10. The group's follow-up album, Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom, produced two Top Ten singles, \\"Do Your Dance\\" and \\"Ooh Boy\\". It also included \\"Wishing on a Star\\", which for Rose Royce was a top-10 hit only in the UK; it became notable elsewhere through its cover versions, including The Cover Girls' Top Ten single in 1992. During 1978, they released their third album, entitled Rose Royce III: Strikes Again!, and it featured \\"I'm in Love (And I Love the Feeling)\\" and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". Both singles entered the Billboard R&B; Top Five. \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" was a number 2 hit in the UK, and would later gain greater exposure through its cover versions, most notably by Madonna in 1984 and 1995. The group followed with a series of modest successes that reached the charts, but never gained the status that their previous songs did. Dickey left the group in April 1980 and Rose Royce temporarily disbanded. However, the remaining members regrouped, adjusted the line-up, and kept the group somewhat popular in the UK, where they remained a marquee attraction. Rose Royce was featured in the TV One's seasonal series, Unsung during the spring of 2010. The story featured the successes and internal bickering of the group. Dickey, Copeland, Jobe, Moore and Garner were the only members of the band who gave interviews throughout the program. Dickey now performs as a solo artist in the UK, but mentioned during the interview that she would not mind performing with the group once again. From 2012-2013, R&B; vocalist Debelah Morgan joined the band as their lead singer for a few shows. Additionally, Bag Raiders and Daft Punk sampled their single \\"First Come First Served\\" with the songs \\"Shooting Stars\\" and \\"Too Long\\" respectively. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Rose Royce among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

His most famous songs include the hits \\"Jail Bait,\\" \\"Greasy Chicken,\\" \\"Bacon Fat\\" (1957) and \\"Cadillac Jack\\" (1966). He was also the co-author of the R&B; hit \\"Shake a Tail Feather\\". Biography Born in Bessemer, Alabama, United States, Williams lived in a housing project with his mother until she died when he was six years of age. A sly and smart young boy, his \\"aunties\\" raised him until he was around 16. He then set out on his own and moved to Detroit, Michigan. There, he became friends with Jack and Devora Brown, owners of Fortune Records which was located at the back of a barber shop. Williams would become label mates with Nolan Strong and Nathaniel Mayer. He then became lead singer for The 5 Dollars in 1955, which already had a contract with Fortune Records. Though most of the songs were billed as 'Andre Williams and the Don Juans' (on Epic in 1956 billed as 'Andre Mr Rhythm Williams and his New Group'), \\"Bacon Fat\\" and \\"Jail Bait\\" were solo efforts. \\"Bacon Fat\\" hit #9 on the US Billboard R&B; chart in 1957. \\"Bacon Fat\\" (written by Williams) was such a success that Fortune Records sold the song to Epic Records, a much larger distributor (released as Epic 5-9196 \\"Bacon Fat/Just because of a Kiss\\"). In 1960 Fortune released an album of all of his singles with the Don Juans, which was titled Jail Bait (re-released in 1986). In 1960, he appeared on Motown's Miracle Record label releasing \\"Rosa Lee\\". In the early 1960s, Williams co-wrote Stevie Wonder's first song, \\"Thank You for Loving Me.\\" Williams' \\"Shake a Tail Feather\\" (with Otha Hayes and Verlie Rice) was also a hit in 1963 for the Five Du-Tones and then for Ike & Tina Turner plus James and Bobby Purify. Alvin Cash & the Crawlers also made a hit out of the Williams song \\"Twine Time\\". As well as these hits, Williams also supervised the making of two albums by The Contours. Additionally, in the 1960s, Williams was the manager and roadie for Edwin Starr. In 1966, Williams released two records on the Avin Records label, then two records more on Detroit's Wingate label: \\"Loose Juice\\" and \\"Do It\\". On the Ric-Tic label in 1967, he released \\"You Got It and I Want It\\". In 1968, Williams was signed to Chess Records on Checker, Chicago's major blues label. They released many hits for Williams ‚Äî \\"Humpin' Bumpin' and Thumpin'\\" and \\"Cadillac Jack\\" in particular. \\"Cadillac Jack\\" reached #46 on the Billboard R&B; chart, his second and final chart hit. Then, he began to work with many unknown black labels and released songs such as \\"Sweet Little Pussy Cat\\" and \\"Rib Tips, Pts. 1 & 2.\\" In 1968, Williams collaborated with the Natural Bridge Bunch to release \\"Pig Snoots,\\" a novelty song about a man named Ricky who would \\"come all way cross town to get me some snoots\\". In the 1970s, Williams wrote some songs for Parliament and Funkadelic. Williams also began to produce for Ike Turner. Throughout the 1980s, Williams was in poverty because of his drug addictions. He lived in Chicago, Illinois; at one point, he was homeless. In 1996, he released Mr. Rhythm, which featured new renditions of his old tunes from the \\"Jail Bait\\" era. These included \\"The Greasy Chicken,\\" \\"Mean Jean,\\" and \\"Pass the Biscuits Please.\\" He changed his style with 1998's Silky. In 1999, he began his relationship with Bloodshot Records by recording a country album with The Sadies, entitled Red Dirt. In 2000, Williams released The Black Godfather, with two songs backed by The Dirtbombs. In 2001 he discussed his recent conversion to Judaism and circumcision. In 2002 and 2003 he toured with the Dutch sleaze rock band, Green Hornet. A return to soul-style music came with Aphrodisiac in 2006. \\"The result is a more laid-back and funky groove that's soulful but potent at the same time, fusing '70s blaxploitation sounds, Jimmy Smith-style jazz figures, and Booker T.-influenced R&B; workouts into one solid package\\" is the way Mark Deming described the album. Williams toured Europe in 2001 (with Green Hornet as backing band), 2005 and 2006 (with the Marshall Brothers). From August to November 2006, he had a short European tour, ending in Switzerland. In early 2008 he undertook a European tour with The Flash Express. In 2007, Williams finished recording an album with the New Orleans-based band, Morning 40 Federation. The album, titled Can You Deal With It, was released by Bloodshot Records in 2008 and is credited to Andre Williams & the New Orleans Hellhounds (the pseudonymous Morning 40 Federation). The 2007 documentary Agile Mobile Hostile: A Year with Andre Williams told of Williams' early career at Fortune Records, his hard life on the streets of Chicago in the 1980s, drug and alcohol abuse, his return to the stage and recording studio in 1995, and his current life and musical career. In 2010, Williams contributed a cover version of \\"The Way You Dog Me Around\\" for the compilation album, Daddy Rockin Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong & The Diablos. The album was a tribute to the late Nolan Strong. In the summer of 2010, Williams worked on an EP with the up-and-coming producer Kerry (Kerby) Moncreace, founder of Kraw Productionsa. Andre Williams and his longtime best friend, Ricardo (Mississippi Rick) Williams, co-wrote with Kerry Moncreace, five rap songs including the urban song that tells the story of a hustler who's woman turns him into the federal government for drug trafficking, \\"Gangbanging\\". Williams had also been known to go by the alias \\"Rudibaker\\" or \\"Rutabaga\\", with which he puts on a different personality and speaks in a gravely voice. In 2012, Williams was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. Andre Williams died March 17, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, at the age of 82.

Career Elected a member of the National Academy of Design in 1842, he succeeded Huntington as president in 1870, holding the position until 1871. The later years of his life were devoted to portrait work. He was strongly influenced by the old Italian masters, painting in mellow colour with a classical tendency. One of his notable canvases was an allegorical composition called \\"The Birth of our Flag\\" (1875). He died in New York City. Major works The Greek Lovers was painted by Gray after a trip to Italy, where he was greatly influenced by the art of the Italian Renaissance. This painting was very well received in its day, and reflects the nineteenth-century fascination with Greco-Roman antiquity. The Pride of the Village was based on Washington Irving‚Äôs story of the same name and is about a beautiful and simple country girl, the proverbial \\"pride of the village,\\" who fell in love with an army officer. When the officer is transferred to another post, he asks that she accompany him, however, her pure mind was so upset by this indecorous suggestion that she pined away, surrounded by her devoted family.

The vessel in the upper part of the photo is the NEL oceanographic research ship . Baya was used as a testbed for two early sonar transducer arrays which markedly changed her appearance. The first arrangement of 196 transducers in a 14√ó14 array was attached to the former gun mount abaft the conning tower, facing starboard and surrounded by a fairwater resembling a second conning tower. After the first array and fairwater were removed, Baya was completely reworked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard during 1958 and 1959 to test the second array, called LORAD (for LOng RAnge Detection). The forward torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by a blunt bow containing the forward-facing transducer array. A mushroom anchor was installed in the bottom of the hull; and a section was added between the former forward torpedo room and the forward battery compartment, with quarters for twelve scientists. These modifications increased her overall length to , and her submerged displacement to approximately 2,600 tons. Her maximum speed was reduced to .

Schultz left in 1997 and was replaced by Richard Anderson on bass guitar and keyboards and Keira Hodgkison on guitar and vocals. They released three albums, Aurora (May 1992), The Last Unicorn (May 1994) and Light Fill My Room (July 2001), before breaking up in December 2002. History Swirl formed in Sydney in early 1991 as an indie guitar pop trio by Ben Aylward on guitar and vocals, David Lord on drums and Nicola Schultz on bass guitar and vocals. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as, \\"[a] very prolific outfit, [their] brand of UK-inspired, noisy guitar pop stamped the band as a popular drawcard on the alternative scene.\\" They recorded their first extended play, Swirl (December 1991), with two of its four tracks at Moonlight Studios (January to February) and the other two at Powerhouse Studios (March to May), Sydney. Their debut album, Aurora (May 1992), was produced by label owner, Nic Dalton. It included some shoegazer elements, such as extensive use of guitar fuzz and reverb on vocals. Their second album, The Last Unicorn, appeared in May 1994. Nicole Leedham of The Canberra Times rated it at eight-out-of-ten and explained, \\"[it] is a simple disc, a welcome relief from most of the over-produced pap that dominates much of the airwaves these days.\\" McFarlane opined, \\"[the tracks] ranged from soft, jangly moments ('Strangelands') to bursts of sonic guitar squalls ('Dark Star', 'The Last Unicorn').\\" It went further into shoegazing territory, with layered, feedback- washed guitar solos and ambient instrumental tracks between songs; it also featured guest performances by Lara Goodridge, later of the FourPlay String Quartet on violin and Sarah Peet on cello. In subsequent years Swirl released a few EPs and played live in Sydney, Melbourne and other Australian cities. They supported gigs by My Bloody Valentine and Ride on their respective tours of Australia. Schultz left in 1997 and was replaced by Richard Anderson on bass guitar and keyboards and Keira Hodgkison on guitar and vocals. In April 1999 the new line-up issued a single, \\"Time\\", which Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project observed was, \\"one of the most uniquely brilliant singles of [that year]\\" where they have \\"remodelled themselves stylistically and musically.\\" During the year 2000, Hodgkison relocated to Melbourne to start at the Victorian College of the Arts, where she studied composition, however the group continued performing upon her periodic returns to Sydney. Swirl's last studio album, Light Fill My Room, was released in July 2001 on independent record label, Um & Ah; it had been recorded a few years earlier and was financed by Festival Mushroom Records, although that label dropped them and so its release was held up. Aylward described their moving labels, \\"we were with Half a Cow for about seven years and it just got to the point where Roger Grierson wanted to sign us to Festival records, and we just thought it was the next step.\\" He explained the delay in releasing the album, \\"We just went through a lot of typical story record company stuff. We recorded this record about two years ago.\\" Lee's associate at Oz Music Project, Michelle Ho felt, \\"[they] have managed to develop their unique sound into something a little more solid, whilst maintaining their fairytale-like pop melodies and beautiful guitar riffs.\\" She observed how their, \\"delicate melodies will send your body into shivers of utter bliss, and Ben and Keira's vocals are sublimely harmonious to the ears. Like an inspirational emotional roller coaster, it takes you up, down, around and back.\\" Light Fill My Room was a more polished, radio-friendly affair; it had elements of Swirl's shoegazing sound, but also ballads and even a children's choir on one track. Swirl broke up in December 2002 as the members pursued other musical projects.  Post break up  In 2010 Swirl released a digital double album of EP, b-sides and live tracks, Satellites (One) and Satellites (Two). These were available via download through iTunes. The original Swirl line-up reunited in 2012 to play at Half a Cow Records tribute nights at the Lansdowne Hotel, Sydney in December of that year and the Tote in Collingwood in January of the following year.

As a scientific umbrella organization it was a founding member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  Objectives  The union has several key objectives: * to promote the study of biological sciences; * to initiate, facilitate and coordinate research and other scientific activities necessitating international, interdisciplinary cooperation; * to ensure the discussion and dissemination of the results of cooperative research, particularly in connection with IUBS scientific programmes; * to support the organisation of international conferences and assist in the publication of their reports.  Networking and cooperation  The Union was a founding member of the ICSU Scientific Committee and works closely with UNESCO. It also maintains relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It cooperates with the European Commission and numerous other organizations, agencies and foundations.  Organisation  The Union currently consists of: * 44 national members, consisting of national science academies, research and scientific organizations, * 80 scientific members, including international scientific associations, societies or commissions of the various biological disciplines, from biology to zoology. New members are allowed under strict scientific guidelines. The national and the academic members identify promising areas of biological science and bring them to the attention of the Union and in the reverse, promote the programs of the Union in their own country to stimulate research projects. The Union reviews the member's suggestions, checks them against the international academic and scientific-political background and develops the programs, if they have sufficient support. Approval is given in the General Assembly and the project progresses through international conferences for accreditation and then implementation through national or international funding agencies.  Board  The Executive Committee consists of: the President, the former President, two Vice-Presidents, the Secretary, the Treasurer and other members of the Extended Board. The Board meets annually. The Secretariat, with its Executive Director coordinates the programs and activities.  General Assembly  In the General Assembly, each national member has one vote. The scientific members are invited to send one representative each to the talks and make programmatic proposals. The General Assembly elects the Executive Board for the proposed projects, selects the scientific programs of the Union, reviews the progress of scientific programs, collaborates with other international organizations and decides on the allocation of funding. The General Assembly takes place in parallel to a scientific conference, organized in cooperation with the National Union Committee of the host country.  Programmes  The scientific programmes of the General Assembly are approved in accordance with the Statutes of the Union. Where necessary and possible, the EU has granted start-up funding for individual programs, that supports the further funding from national or international donors or by negotiated agreements with the Union.  Examples of programmes  Diversitas, Human Dimensions of Biodiversity, Climate Change Integrative Biology (ICCB), Systematics Agenda, Biological Education (BioED), IUBS Bioethics Ethics Committee earlier, Bionomenclature, Biology and Traditional Knowledge, Biological Consequences of Global Change (BCGC) Darwin200, Biosystematics, Species 2000, Genomics and Evolution, Modernizing the codes to meet future needs of scientific communities (Biocode), Biology Research and Education Resources in Africa, Reproductive Biology, Aquaculture, Bio-Energy and Towards an Integrative Biology (TAIB).  Publications  The institution publishes four times a year Biology International and other publications such as IUBS Monograph Series, Methodology Manual Series and the Proceedings of the IUBS General Assemblies.  Legal status and finance  The International Union of Biological Sciences is non-profit and does not pursue economic goals. It is funded from the following sources: * annual dues of full members; * assistance received from UNESCO and other international organizations that support the scientific programs of the Union; * other sources The activities of the Union are within an annual budget of about 340,000, - ‚Ç¨ (2006). Of these, the salaries of a director and a secretary are paid, who run the Union's office in Paris. All other offices (President, Secretary General, Treasurer, etc.) are honorary offices for which only the direct expenses will be paid for.  History  The Union was founded in 1919 following the work of the Conference of Allied Academies of Sciences held in Brussels. Originally the 'S' was not for science but for Societies. After defining its constitution and organization in 1925, the IUBS adheres to the International Research Council (International Council for Science), which is now known by the acronym ICSU (International Council of Scientific Unions). From 1925 to 1939, the IUBS worked on two main themes: information science and the environment. This second project resulted in the creation of the World Conservation Union or IUCN. After being dormant for 1935 to 1949, the IUCB developed a highly original program of international research: * In the eighties, it developed a number of scientific programs, such as the Decade of the Tropics, bioindicators, biological complexity and biodiversity. * Since the 2000s the organization has been working on various projects: Diversity, Biosystematics, Species 2000 and Bionomenclature.

Early life Huntington was born in New York City, New York on October 4, 1816. He was the son of Benjamin Huntington, Jr. and Faith (n√©e Trumbull) Huntington. His paternal grandfather was Benjamin Huntington, delegate at the Second Continental Congress and first U.S. Representative from Connecticut. His maternal grandfather was Jedediah Huntington (1743‚Äì1818) of Norwich, Connecticut, who served as a General in the American Revolutionary War. He studied at Yale with Samuel F.B. Morse, and later with Henry Inman. From 1833 to 1835 he transferred to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he met Charles Loring Elliott, who encouraged him to become an artist. Career Huntington first exhibited his work at the National Academy of Design in 1836. Subsequently, he painted some landscapes in the tradition of the Hudson River School. Huntington made several trips to Europe, the first in 1839 traveling to England, Rome, Florence and Paris with his friend and pupil Henry Peters Gray. On his return to America in 1840, he painted his allegorical painting \\"Mercy's Dream\\", which brought him fame and confirmed his interest in inspirational subjects. He also painted portraits and began the illustration of The Pilgrim's Progress. In 1844, he went back to Rome. Returning to New York around 1846, he devoted his time chiefly to portrait-painting, although he painted many genre, religious and historical subjects. From 1851 to 1859 he was in England. He was president of the National Academy of Design from 1862 to 1870, and again in 1877‚Äì1890. He was also vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Looking at Pictures in the Grand Salon: a guide to the artists. Smithsonian American Art Museum, Renwick Gallery.

It later branched into other locations such as the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the United States and the Soviet Union. History In 1980, promoter Paul Loasby, along with Maurice Jones, planned a one-day festival dedicated specifically for bands within the hard rock and heavy metal genre. Loasby was an established and successful promoter working that year on the Rainbow UK tour and penned the festival as the final show of the tour for the band to headline. Jones knew the owner of the Donington Park race track, Tom Wheatcroft, located next to the village of Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England, and the site was chosen to host the event.https://www.nme.com/news/download-festival/51483 (A year earlier, promoter Bill Graham‚Äôs July 1979 Day on the Green Festival at Oakland Coliseum in California was also dubbed \\"The Monsters of Rock\\" show. This concert featured Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and AC/DC.) Donington Park was unknown as a major location but its location in the East Midlands next to the M1, A42 and A50 allowed for better transportation to the site from around the country. Additionally the site ground level sloped which allowed for a better viewing for the audience throughout the site. The first Monsters of Rock line-up consisted of a mix of British and international bands and was a success with 35,000 heavy metal fans attending. Although only conceived as a one off event, it was mentioned on the day the idea that the festival will return the following year and the first edition birthed what would become a regular festival for the next 15 years, becoming synonymous as a Mecca for fans of the genre and further establishing the Midlands as the home of heavy metal. Over the years, the attendance continued to grow, reaching 107,000 in 1988, when two fans died during the Guns N' Roses set. Initially the blame was thought to be the size of the crowd and a rush forward during the band's set but officially the cause is laid on the weather, causing muddy and wet conditions on the sloping ground. As a result, the festival did not take place in 1989, but returned the year after with a limitation to the crowd of 75,000. The festival had been held in parallel in West Germany from 1983 to 1991. In 1984 and 1986 the festival branched into Sweden. In 1988, the festival occurred for the first time in France, Italy, Spain and The Netherlands. It was held as a one-time event in 1991 in Soviet Union (one of the largest concerts of all time, with an estimated audience of over 1.6 million), Poland, Belgium, Hungary. In 1994, the festival was exported overseas to Chile, Argentina and Brazil. In 1993 the MONSTERS OF ROCK¬Æ radio show debuted in the United States with host Harlan Hendrickson. Guests on the show include everyone from AC/DC, KISS, Van Halen, Judas Priest, Mot√∂rhead, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, Bon Jovi, Cheap Trick, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Ratt, Dio, Y&T;, Guns N' Roses, Slayer and Poison. The Monsters of Rock festival continued on as the premier hard rock and heavy metal event in Great Britain in the 1990s but started to fall upon hard times as heavy metal became less popular, with another cancellation in 1993 due to being unable to find a strong enough headliner. In 1995 the festival found itself in a similar situation until Metallica agreed to play with the condition of the band having control over the event and naming it \\"Escape from the Studio\\". In 1996 Ozzy Osbourne and KISS co-headlined the festival and although there were plans to extend the festival into a two-day event in 1997, the promoters once again found themselves in a struggle for headliners and the event was cancelled and discontinued. Donington Park remained event-less until 2001 when the Rock and Blues Festival and Stereophonics held events at the site. In 2002 the Ozzfest tour returned to the UK using Donington Park as their only British event and the following year Live Nation picked up the reins as Monsters of Rock's successor in the name of Download Festival. An outstanding success from the offset, the festival continues to this day having increased to a three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event has been relegated outside of the track. In 2006, the Monsters of Rock name was revived and held at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes, England, for a one off event headlined by Deep Purple and with Alice Cooper as a special guest. In 2012 Harlan Hendrickson & Monsters of Rock Worldwide partnered with Larry Morand and Mike London to launch the inaugural Monsters Of Rock Cruise.

Life It is believed Repyngdon was born in Wales in around 1345. He became an Augustinian canon, first at Repton Abbey, then at Leicester Abbey where he was ordained to the priesthood on 26 May 1369. He was educated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, graduating with a Doctorate of Divinity in 1382. A man of some learning, Repyngdon came to the front as a defender of the doctrines taught by John Wycliffe; for this he was suspended and afterwards excommunicated, but in a short time he was pardoned and restored by Archbishop William Courtenay, and he appears to have completely abandoned his unorthodox opinions. In 1394, Repyngdon was made abbot of the abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis at Leicester, and after the accession of Henry IV to the English throne in 1399 he became chaplain and confessor to this king, being described as clericus specialissimus domini regis Henrici. On 19 November 1404, Repyngdon was chosen bishop of Lincoln, and was consecrated on 29 March 1405. In 1408, Pope Gregory XII created him a cardinal, however, it was not recognised in England, and the creation was revoked in 1409. He resigned his bishopric on 20 November 1419. Some of Repyngdon's sermons are in manuscript at Oxford and at Cambridge. In 1405, Repyngdon attempted to promote a pilgrimage site at Yarborough devoted to the Blessed Sacrament, after the church there was destroyed by fire. The pyx which contained the consecrated Host was the only thing to survive the fire, and the bishop attempted to establish a cult centre there, but it failed.

Introduced in 1999, it preceded the Apple iPod, SanDisk Sansa, and other similar players. It was designed and developed by Compaq Research (SRC and PAAD groups) starting in May 1998. Compaq did not release the player themselves, but licensed the design to HanGo Electronics Co., Ltd. of South Korea. Compaq Research published a software development kit for the unit, which enabled users to develop tools, drivers and applications for different operating systems. Personal Jukebox History Development The PJB was created as a personal audio appliance prototype by DEC Systems Research Center and Palo Alto Advanced Development group (PAAD). The project started in May 1998, a month before the Digital Equipment Corporation merger into Compaq was completed, and a final product was brought to market in November 1999. The PJB was the first hard-disk-based MP3 player made available on the market. The \\"100\\" in the \\"PJB-100\\" name was chosen from the capacity of the original 4.86 GB hard drive in the first Personal Jukebox. With this drive, the unit was expected to hold about 100 popular (45 minute) music CDs encoded at 128 kbit/s. The name was kept for the later models with bigger hard drives, even though these could store a larger number of albums. The PJB-100 was the first MP3 portable to garner a \\"Milestone\\" product designation from MP3 Newswire, which they defined in their January 2000 review of the PJB-100 as \\"any product whose breakthrough innovations are so significant, they influence the future course of its industry\\". Licensing, marketing and distribution Instead of manufacturing the player themselves, Compaq licensed the design to HanGo, which called it the \\"Personal Jukebox - PJB-100\\". The license from Compaq to HanGo was worldwide exclusive - nobody else could license the technology from Compaq during the term of the HanGo license. HanGo granted a distribution agreement to US company Hy-Tek Manufacturing of Sugar Grove, IL in 2001. HanGo rebranded the units sold through Hy-Tek as the \\"Compressor\\". HanGo took the PJB-100 into mass production and introduced it to the public at the Las Vegas COMDEX in November 1999. The first units were sold in a special auction held by MP3.com, with bids exceeding US$1000. Some winners received their players before the end of 1999. The first auctioned units were hand-built by the Compaq engineers who designed it, and had single-digit serial numbers. Specifications * Measurements: 150√ó80√ó26 mm (5.9√ó3.15√ó1.0 inches) (W√óH√óD) * Weight: 280g (9.9 ounces), 304g (10.7 ounces) including battery * Playback: MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) at bitrates of 8 to 320kbit/s and a sample rate of 44.1kHz (playback support for WAV is in the firmware, but is not enabled - it was used by the developers before the MP3 decoder was licensed from Fraunhofer IIS). * Audio signal-to-noise ratio (S/N): >90dB * Audio total harmonic distortion (THD): <0.1% * Frequency response: 20Hz to 20kHz * Audio output power: >50 mW at 32 ohm impedance Hardware Digital signal processor (DSP) The heart of the PJB is its Digital Signal Processor. It controls the hard-drive, buttons, LCD, USB interface and handles MP3-decoding for playback. The PJB uses a 24 bit Motorola 56309 DSP running at 33 MHz. The MP3 codec (which is about 2 MB in assembly DSP code) was licensed from Thomson and Fraunhofer IIS. Memory The PJB has 12 MB of DRAM and 1 MB of flash memory. The DRAM is used to buffer data (between 8 and 12 minutes of music, depending on the bitrate used for encoding) from the hard disk during playback. The buffer allows the disk to be run only intermittently, preserving battery life. When the hard-disk is stopped, battery life is preserved; the ramp-loaded heads also retract from the disk surface, helping to reduce the possibility of damage. The flash memory houses the firmware as well as the bootstrap. Communication interface To transfer data, the PJB is equipped with a USB 1.1 Type B connector. Inside is a Philips PDIUSBD12 USB peripheral controller, which averages a raw throughput of about 400 kB/s. Early prototypes used Ethernet instead of USB for data transmission. USB was used in production models because it was more common than Ethernet on standard home computers in 1998. Display The PJB's LCD has a resolution of 128√ó64 pixels (2:1 ratio) at a diameter of 3 inches (76.2 mm). Later versions of the PJB also featured a backlit display (the backlight comes on when the unit is powered on, or a button is pressed and turns off automatically after a few seconds). The character set the PJB uses internally is Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), with some minor variations. One of the Compaq developers stated that \\"it's missing some of the symbols in the range 160 to 255 (because I got bored when I was creating them :-). Upper case accented characters are rendered unaccented, because that looks better within the font's 9 pixel height. There are some glyphs in the range 0 to 31, used for the symbols on the screen. Hard drive While flash players could store between 32 and a maximum of 128 MB at the time, the first PJB could store 4.86 GB of music. While the PJB-100 was updated as bigger drives became available, it was also possible for end users to replace the hard drive (although voiding the warranty in that case). Buttons/controls The PJB has 6 buttons on the front: * Left/Previous/Rewind * Right/Next/Forward * Up * Down * Play/Pause * Stop/Power off Volume is adjusted by a wheel on the unit's right side, using a digital mechanism (it can be turned indefinitely). It also is possible to click or push the wheel, which pauses playback and turns the unit off after about one minute. When the unit is powered off and the wheel is pressed for a few seconds, playback resumes. This also works when the buttons are locked, in case the main controls cannot be easily accessed. On the same side is also a small switch which locks the unit‚Äôs controls (except for the wheel). Battery and power supply The PJB is not powered by dry cell batteries like most other players at the time of its development, but by a provided HanGo Lithium ion battery. HanGo sold a more powerful 1600 mA battery to be used in the PJB. The PJB includes a 5V power supply which charges the battery and enables playback without a battery in the unit at all. The charging control circuit for the battery is built into the PJB itself, not the power supply, so the use of a replacement power supply requires only the proper voltage and sufficient current capacity. Accessories Included accessories Compared to other players, the PJB included accessories. Details varied from distributor to distributor, but UHU/Portacomp AG included: * Koss Porta Pro headphones * Leather case with belt clip * 5 V power supply with converters for European and American power outlets (except UK) * 1350 mW/3.6 V Li-Ion battery (see the battery section) * USB 1.1 compliant A-B connector cable * Cinch-Audio cable 3.5 mm to RCA * Manual (in German and English) * CD with drivers and Jukebox Manager software (Windows, Mac OS/OS X, Linux) Optional accessories Accessories were offered by distributors (among them headphones and speakers, also for use with other audio hardware than the PJB and replacements for the included accessories): * 1600 mAh Li-Ion Battery * Waterproof neoprene bag for use of the PJB at a beach or pool * Audio-cassette adapter for playback on car/home stereos * Swan-neck car-holder * Magnetic mounts to attach the PJB within a car * Power-supply-adapters for car cigarette-lighters Firmware Features and version history The latest firmware version, which surfaced in December 2003, is v2.3.3-alpha; the latest stable version is v2.3.2, introduced in mid-2001. Initially, the functions provided by the player were basic: when music was played back, selecting another track would immediately start this track and stop the current one; playlists had to be created on the computer; files could only be uploaded to the PJB, but not downloaded back to the computer. New firmware versions came out regularly, but were mostly bug fixes with very few new functions introduced. Later firmware versions added some of the most requested features: * Files could be transferred from player to PC * The ability to browse without interrupting playback * Some (hidden) games were added File system and table of contents (TOC) The PJB's disk is not formatted as FAT or FAT32 as is the case with most of the players that were released later, and enables those to be mounted as another drive in an operating system. Instead, a unique file system is used, which, while losing the mounting ability, is optimized for the structure of MP3 files (having a cluster size of 128 kB, which equals about 8 seconds of 128-kBit-encoded MP3-music). Therefore, managing actions like defragging become unnecessary. The file system allows the linking of Tracks into various Discs/Sets. Therefore, each track is ideally only stored once on the disc and recurring occurrences of it (for example in playlists or samplers) are just links to the original file. This may help to preserve a good amount of disk space and allows for more tracks to be stored on the disk. All of this info is stored in the TOC (table of contents). The TOC is stored in a human-readable text-format and can be downloaded, changed with a text editor and re-uploaded to the PJB again. A copy of the TOC is always stored on the unit as well, so errors and damage to the original TOC can usually be fixed. Software Software development kit The original developers at Compaq Research designed an SDK (Software Development Kit) for the unit and published it under the Open Source GPL license in 2000. Drivers The PJB does not integrate itself as a USB mass storage device into modern operating systems. Special drivers are required to make the operating system recognize an attached PJB. Drivers for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS were included, while drivers for Linux were developed by the open source community. Jukebox Manager (Windows, Mac OS) The included management tool for the PJB is the Jukebox Manager (the latest Windows version is v1.5.6). It can create/delete/manage Sets, Discs and Tracks (when uploading, the user can choose which ID3-tag will represent which level). It can also encode CDs directly onto the PJB and query the CDDB for the proper disc/track information. Finally it can update the firmware. If manipulating some values in the Windows Registry, a hidden menu appears, which can be used to debug and in some cases repair a damaged TOC. The Jukebox Manager does not make use of some of the firmware‚Äôs later features, such as downloading tracks back to the computer and does not provide advanced features such as mass-uploading, synchronizing or creating playlists from M3U-playlists. Linux projects There are Linux projects operating on SourceForge (some under the banner of the OpenPJB project). These range from Jukebox-Manager-like applications with a GUI for various window managers to projects making the PJB's file system mountable as a drive in Linux. Some of the projects include: * Jukebox Manager (KDE) * GNOME/GTK+ GUI Personal Jukebox Manager (GNOME) * Emacs PJB Manager * PJB File System for Linux (Kernel 2.3/4, 2.6) * PJB VFS module (for use with Nautilus) * pjmirror (written in Perl to synchronize the PJB with data on the PC) External links * The new and improved PJB-100 User Group at Yahoo!

Early life Nott was born at Ashford, Connecticut, on June 25, 1773. He was the second son, and youngest of nine children, born to Stephen Nott and Deborah (n√©e Selden) Nott. In 1795, he earned a degree from Rhode Island College (which later became known as Brown University). Career Cover of pamphlet created from 1804 Nott sermon, On the Death of Hamilton.Opening text of sermon. Around 1802, he was called to the Presbyterian Church at Albany, where he took a prominent position as a preacher and was listened to by large congregations. Among his successful pulpit efforts at Albany, was a sermon entitled on the death of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, entitled On the Death of Hamilton, where he condemned the practice of dueling that had profound influence in curtailing the custom and remains recognized to this day as an exemplary period example of the orator's art. College presidency In 1804, at the age of 31, Nott became president of Union College, a role he served in until his death in 1866 and during which, more than 4,000 students are estimated to have graduated from Union. He also served as president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from 1829 to 1845, where he \\"visited the school at least every third week and was compensated with one dollar per visit plus all graduation fees.\\" Upon assuming the presidency of Union, he reportedly found the College financially embarrassed and successfully worked to place it on sound footings. In the early 1830s, after the founding of the Union Triad fraternities, Nott called for the dissolution of all fraternities. He was dissuaded from this by a member of Delta Phi named John Jay Hyde. In 1805, the College of New Jersey conferred upon him the title of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity), and in 1828, he received the title of LL.D. His publications include collections of sermons, Counsels to Young Men (1810), and Lectures on Temperance (1847). In 1814, Nott was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. A number of imprints authored by Nott, or related to him in some way reside in the society's collections. Inventor and real estate investor As a scientist, he studied heat and obtaining some thirty or more patents for applications of heat to steam engines, but was best known in his day as the inventor of the first stove for anthracite coal, which was named for him. Nott was an important land speculator and developer, partnering with his nephew Henry Sheldon Anable, buying several farms on the Long Island shore of the East River, that became the sites of industrial enterprises. Personal life He married Sarah Marie \\"Sally\\" Benedict (1774‚Äì1804), the daughter of Rev. Joel Benedict of Plainfield, Connecticut, under whose instruction in early life he pursued his classical and mathematical studies. Before Sally's death at the age of 29 on March 10, 1804, they were the parents of: * Sarah Marie Nott (1799‚Äì1839), who married Bishop Alonzo Potter, brother of Bishop Horatio Potter. * John Nott (1801‚Äì1878), who married Mary Ann Lawrence (1824‚Äì1911) in 1830. * Benjamin Nott (1802‚Äì1881), who married Elizabeth Cooper (1808‚Äì1867), parents of Charles C. Nott. In 1807, he married Gertrude Peebles Tibbits (1771‚Äì1841), who died in January 1841. In 1842, a year and a half after the death of his second wife, Nott married the much younger Urania Elizabeth Sheldon (1806‚Äì1886), a Troy Female Seminary graduate who was a well-known superintendent of several women's schools and the leader of several local benevolent associations. Beginning in 1860, Nott suffered a series of strokes while serving as president. He died on January 25, 1866, in Schenectady, New York, and was buried at the Vale Cemetery in Schenectady. His widow died on April 19, 1886, at age 80. Legacy The Nott Memorial The Nott Memorial, a centerpiece of the Union College's campus, was built by his grandson, and Union graduate, Edward Tuckerman Potter and named in Nott's honor. Nott Road in Rexford, New York, the location of his farm, is named for him, as are Nott Street and Nott Terrace, which border Union College in Schenectady, New York. He remains the longest serving college president in the United States to this day.

Ripons were also sold to Finland, where they continued to be used in action in the Winter War and the Continuation War until 1944. Development The Blackburn Ripon was designed to replace the single-seat Dart torpedo bomber. In accordance with Air Ministry Specification 21/23, it was also required to be used for long-range reconnaissance, for which a two-man crew was demanded. The first prototype flew on 17 April 1926 as a landplane, with the second prototype following on 26 August first flying as a seaplane. Initial trials against its competitors, the Handley Page Harrow and the Avro Buffalo, showed that none of the competitors were adequate, so the Ripon was redesigned with an improved engine installation, an enlarged rudder and increased sweepback on the wings. Thus improved, the Ripon was declared the winner and ordered for service. Four prototypes and 90 production aircraft were manufactured by Blackburn for use by the Fleet Air Arm. The Baffin was a development of the Ripon, which replaced it in service with the Fleet Air Arm, with 68 Ripons converted to Baffins. Service The only preserved Blackburn Ripon, which has an Armstrong Siddeley Panther radial engine. It is stored in the P√§ij√§nne Tavastia Aviation Museum in Asikkala, Finland The Ripon entered service with the Fleet Air Arm in 1929, six joining No 462 (Fleet Torpedo Bomber) Flight aboard in January of that year. The Ripon was normally used as a carrier-based landplane by the Fleet Air Arm, and although capable of being converted to a seaplane, was rarely fitted with floats. The Ripon continued in service with Torpedo Bomber flights until 1933, when the Fleet Air Arm was reorganised into three larger squadrons, No. 810, No. 811 and No. 812. The last Ripons were retired from service in January 1935 when 811 Naval Air Squadron re-equipped with Blackburn Baffins. The Blackburn Ripon was also ordered for use by the Finnish Air Force, with one example for Finland being built by Blackburn, before 25 were produced under licence at the Finnish Aircraft Factory. These were powered with a number of different radial engines; the pattern aircraft had a 530 hp (400 kW) Bristol Jupiter VII, the next seven had 480 hp (360 kW) Gnome Rhone Jupiter VI, followed by eight with 535 hp (399 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Panther engines and the final ten with 580 hp (430 kW) Bristol Pegasus engines. The Finnish Air Force used Ripons as reconnaissance aircraft against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War. After losing an aircraft to Soviet fighters in 1939, the Ripon was limited to night missions. The last missions were flown in 1944. One Ripon coded RI-140 was stored and has been reassembled and put on display in the P√§ij√§nne Tavastia Aviation Museum recently. It is the only preserved example. Variants * Ripon I : Prototype.

History  Pevsner describes Great Chalfield as \\"one of the most perfect examples of the late medieval English manor house\\". The moated manor house was built around 1465‚Äì1480 for Thomas Tropenell, a modest member of the landed gentry who made a fortune as a clothier. The independent hall, lit on both sides, is flanked by unusually symmetrical gabled cross wings, with oriel windows and lower gabled porches in the inner corners, in the north-facing former entrance court, for which the richest effects were reserved. Its external symmetry, unusual for its date, is superficial.Nicholas Cooper, Houses of the Gentry 480-1680 1999:60, floorplan fig.39, 61, 64. The intimately connected parish church, largely rebuilt by Tropnell, also faces into the court, which was formerly entered obliquely through a gatehouse in the west wing; Nicholas Cooper observes of the church that \\"the probable need to pass through the house's forecourt in order to reach it neatly demonstrates the community of secular and religious authority\\".Cooper 1999:64. Part of a moat survives, but the forecourt has been opened up to the outside in a manner that changes its original inward-facing aspect.A point made by Cooper 1999:61. Great Chalfield: the less formal southern aspect The house passed into the Eyre family by the marriage of Ann Tropenell to John Eyre of Wedhampton in 1550. It passed down in the Eyre family for three generations until 1631 when Sir John Eyre sold it to Sir Richard Gurney, Lord Mayor of London. It afterwards passed via Thomas and William Hanham, John Hall of Bradford and Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull to Robert Neale. The house was altered substantially (with some of the original character lost) after the Neale family commissioned the architect Thomas Larkins Walker, a pupil of Pugin, to carry out a detailed survey of the manor in 1836; though his restoration proposals of 1837 were never carried out, the house was reduced and in particular, the great hall, adapted as a farmhouse, lost its ornate ceiling, with only one of the original bosses surviving. One of four clipped yew garden features Externally there is a garden with four \\"tree houses\\", groups of four clipped yews that have grown together and been hollowed out inside to allow one to walk through.  20th century and today  The house and garden were purchased by George Fuller MP (of Neston Park) in the early 1900s, and restored and furnished between 1905 and 1911 by his fourth son, Major Robert Fuller, under the guidance of Sir Harold Brakspear. The restoration included a sympathetic garden design by Alfred Parsons. Robert Fuller gave the property to the National Trust in 1943, and it is open to the public. Robert Floyd, grandson of Robert Fuller, and his family live here and manage the property for the Trust. Tours of the house are at fixed times and visitors are escorted by a guide. Doors of the barn The house is Grade I listed; the Tropenell Cartulary manuscript, compiled for Thomas Tropenell, is still kept there. The barn northwest of the house, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, is also Grade I listed, while the gardens are Grade II listed.  Church  All Saints' Church stands close to the house All Saints' Church, near the front of the house, is a small church dating from the 14th century. It is Great Chalfield's parish church, although the civil parish was amalgamated into the newly created parish of Atworth in 1884. A chapel at Great Chalfield was first mentioned in 1316; in 1428 it was a church with fewer than ten parishioners. The present church was built c. 1480 by Thomas Tropnell and the surviving features from that time include the south chapel, the small square bellcote and the roof of the nave. Robert Neale carried out improvements in 1775 which included the addition of a family chapel, now used as a vestry, to the east of the south chapel. Several windows are from the 19th century and further restoration was undertaken in 1914. The font is 13th century and the pulpit 17th. Church registers survive from 1605. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1962. Today the church is part of the benefice of Broughton Gifford, Great Chalfield & Holt.  Film industry  The house and grounds have hosted the film industry since the end of the 20th century. They were used for Wives and Daughters in 1999, the BBC television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, as Hamley Hall, the country house of a squire. They were later used for location filming of the 2008 film version of the historical novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and some scenes of the 2008 BBC Television adaptation of Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Scenes for the BBC's Tudor-era historical TV serial Wolf Hall were filmed there in 2014. The house is also used as the filming location for Killewarran House in the BBC series of Poldark.

Along with the three Basque provinces of Soule, Lower Navarre, and Labourd, the principality of Bidache, as well as small parts of Gascony, it forms in the southwest the current d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques (64). The capitals of B√©arn were Beneharnum (until 841), Morla√†s (from ca. 1100), Orthez (from the second half of the 13th century), and then Pau (beginning in the mid-15th century).Bidot-Germa, Grosclaude, Duchon, Histoire de B√©arn, 1986 B√©arn is bordered by Basque provinces Soule and Lower Navarre to the west, by Gascony (Landes and Armagnac) to the north, by Bigorre to the east, and by Spain (Aragon) to the south. Today, the mainstays of the B√©arn area are the petroleum industry, the aerospace industry through the helicopter turboshaft engine manufacturer Turbomeca, tourism and agriculture (much of which involves maize (corn) grown for seed). Pau was the birthplace of Elf Aquitaine, which has now become a part of the Total S.A. petroleum company. In Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers series, the protagonist d'Artagnan came from B√©arn (he mentions having attended his father's funeral there in the second book, Twenty Years After). That d'Artagnan is usually referred to as a Gascon is neither surprising nor incorrect, as B√©arn forms part of Gascony. In the eastern part of the province are two small exclaves belonging to Bigorre. They are the result of how early B√©arn grew to its traditional boundaries: some old lesser viscounties were added by marriage, and absorbed into B√©arn: Oloron to the south/southwest ca. 1050, Montan√©r√®s in the east in 1085, and Dax in the west in 1194.Bidot-Germa, Grosclaude, Duchon, Histoire de B√©arn, 1986, p. 23 When Montan√©r√®s was added, five communities or parishes (Villenave-Pr√®s-B√©arn, Escaunets, S√©ron, Gard√®res, and Luquet) did not form part of the dowry; they remained, or became, part of Bigorre. Their attachment to Bigorre continues to the present, as they followed it into Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, rather than being incorporated into the surrounding Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.  History   Etymology  The name B√©arn derives from Beneharnum, the capital city of the ancient Venarni people, which was destroyed by Vikings by 840. The modern town of Lescar is built on the site of Beneharnum.  Prehistory  Agriculture and metallurgy were first practiced in the region around 4,000 years ago. Many dolmens, tumuli and megaliths have been found in B√©arn dating to this era, suggesting that ancestor worship was an important religious activity in neolithic B√©arn. Construction of croml√™hs in B√©arn continued into the Bronze Age. Fortified villages were also constructed in Neolithic B√©arn, and remains of these have been found near Asson, Bougarber and Lacq.  Antiquity  B√©arn was occupied by Ligurians around 3000 years ago. By 500 BC, Iberians appear to have replaced the Ligurians. The names of several towns in B√©arn end in -os (e.g. Gelos, Urdos and Arros) which suggests an Iberian origin. The region became part of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. Diocletian included Bearn in the Roman province of Novempopulania. Roman influence in the region waned in the fifth century AD, and B√©arn experienced multiple barbarian invasions. B√©arn was successively conquered by the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Merovingians and finally the Carolingians. The fifth century AD also saw the arrival of Christianity in B√©arn. The rural character of B√©arn meant that Christianity took longer to become established there than elsewhere in France.  Transport   Road  B√©arn is served by two autoroutes. The A64 (l'autoroute pyr√©n√©enne, European designation E80) was built in 1977 and links Pau, Toulouse and Bayonne. In B√©arn, the A64 has junctions serving the towns of Salies-de-B√©arn, Orthez, Artix, Pau and Soumoulou. The A65 (l'autoroute de Gascogne, European designation E7) links Pau with Langon. It serves the B√©arnese towns of Lescar, Th√®ze and Garlin. At Langon, the A65 joins on to the A62, which continues to Bordeaux. The A65 was opened in 2010, and was at the time France's most expensive autoroute. Several more minor routes also serve B√©arn. The Route Nationale 134 links the south of Pau with Somport in the Aspe Valley. Several mountain roads link Somport with Spain.  Rail  Three railway lines serve B√©arn. The first of these is the Toulouse to Bayonne railway, which was opened in stages between 1861 and 1867. Several rail stations are located on this line, including those of Coarraze-Nay, Assat, Pau, Artix, Orthez and Puyo√¥. The Puyo√¥ to Dax railway line enables trains to run from B√©arn to Bordeaux. Both these railway lines are served by TGV, Intercit√©s and TER. The third railway line, the Pau to Canfranc line, serves the south of B√©arn. It was put into service between 1883 and 1928. However, the railway line been partially closed since 1970. This is because in 1970, a bridge carrying this rail line over the Gave d'Aspe was destroyed by a train derailment; SNCF consequently closed the line south of the Gare d'Oloron- Sainte-Marie. An additional section of the line, between Oloron-Sainte-Marie and Bedous, was reopened by SNCF in 2016. Canfranc Railway Station is located within Spain and is also served by the Spanish Jaca to Canfranc railway. International rail transport between B√©arn and Aragon was thus previously possible using this route. In 2013, the regional governments of Aragon and Aquitaine agreed to take steps to further the economic links between their two regions, including possibly reopening the Pau-Canfranc railway line all the way to Canfranc Station. The two governments hope to have the line fully reopened by 2020. A fourth railway line once linked Puyo√¥ rail station to that of Maul√©on-Licharre. This line opened in two stages between 1884 and 1887; it was closed to passengers in 1968 and to freight in 1989. The line was officially abandoned in 1991. A branch of this line ran from Autevielle to Saint-Palais. This branch is also now closed.  Aviation  Monument to the world's first aviation school at Pau Pyr√©n√©es Airport. Pau Pyr√©n√©es Airport, situated near Uzein, has direct flights to Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport (9 flights in total to Paris daily), Lyon‚ÄìSaint-Exup√©ry Airport (3 flights daily) and Marseille Provence Airport. During summer, it also has flights to Bastia ‚Äì Poretta Airport, Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport, Naples International Airport and Bari Karol Wojty≈Ça Airport. 634,000 passengers used Pau Pyr√©n√©es Airport in 2015, making it the third busiest airport in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine r√©gion of France, after Bordeaux‚ÄìM√©rignac Airport and Biarritz Pays Basque Airport. B√©arn has a long association with aviation. The meteorological conditions of B√©arn were convenient for early aviators, and the Wright brothers made several flights in Pont-Long, a flat marshy area north of Pau from 1908 onwards. Wilbur Wright helped set up the world's first aviation school, which opened outside Pau in 1908. Pau Pyr√©n√©es Airport is located on the site of this aviation school.

Early life  Archbishop Andronik was born as Vladimir Nikolsky, on August 1, 1870, in Povodnevo, a village in Myshkin uyezd, Yaroslavl diocese. His father was a deacon in the Russian Orthodox Church. After he finished his studies at the Yaroslavl Seminary in 1891, he entered the Moscow Theological Academy. On August 1, 1893, during his studies in Moscow, he was tonsured a monk and given the religious name of Andronik. He was ordained to the diaconate on August 6 of that same year. On July 22, 1895, he was ordained as a priest. \\"Hieromartyr Andronicus, Archbishop Of Perm And Those With Him\\", St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, McKinney, Texas  Russian Orthodox Church  From 1895, Andronik was assigned first to the theological seminary of Kutaisi in Georgia and then at the seminary at Ardon as inspector and instructor.  Bishop of Kyoto  In 1897, Andronik was assigned as a member of the Russian Orthodox mission to the Empire of Japan, under Bishop Nikolai (Kasatkin), later glorified as St. Nicholas of Japan, to assist him in his missionary work, which he began 1861. Hieromonk Andronik was very surprised by this assignment and felt inadequate for the position, but ultimately he accepted it as God's will. His journey began in St. Petersburg, on September 21, 1897, and continued from Odessa with Archimandrite Sergius (Stragorodsky) on October 26. Traveling through European countries and the United States, they arrived in Japan on December 26. He wrote and published a book about this journey, A Missionary Journey to Japan (published in Kazan, Russia in 1899). On November 5, 1906, Andronik was consecrated as the first Bishop of Kyoto, which became the seat of the West Japan Diocese of the Japanese Orthodox Church. Although Bishop Andronik was the bishop of Kyoto, he lived in Osaka which, while it then was the second largest city in Japan, was also where most of Orthodox faithful lived. After he arrived in Osaka, he began to feel ill and found performing his duties difficult. After serving in Osaka for three months, he asked leave to resign and to depart from Japan. On May 27, 1907, he left Japan and returned to Russia. There, he was assigned on October 26 to be the deputy to Bishop Eulogius of Kholm. In 1908, he was assigned bishop of Tikhvin in Novgorod diocese.  Bishop of Perm and Solokamsk  On July 30, 1914, Andronik was appointed bishop of Perm and Solikamsk. Eleven days before, on July 19, World War I began. As the war progressed, he worked energetically for one and a half million inhabitants and 570 churches in this region. In summer 1916, Andronik traveled to the Imperial Russian Army headquarters outside St. Petersburg where Tsar Nicholas II was leading the army. The purpose of this trip was to warn the Tsar about Rasputin. However, the Tsar would not take him seriously and his trip failed. But Nicholas II was pleased with the gift Bishop Andronik gave him on behalf of the people, a pair of soldier's boots that the province of Perm provided the army.  Bolshevik Revolution  In 1917, Andronik became Bishop of Perm and Kungur, and became one of the seven hierarchs in the pre-conciliar synod preparing for the Local Council of the Russian Church in Moscow. He was very active throughout the council, from August 1917 until April 1918, which was the end of the second session of the Council. As the agitation of the Bolshevik take-over intensified on January 25, 1918, Bishop Adronik made a written appeal to the faithful to defend the heritage of the Church from the aggressors and looters as attacks became more frequent. Andronik was a firm supporter of the Tsar. From his point of view, it was God's will that the anointed Tsar should reign over the empire; hence, the monarchy was an appropriate governmental system for Christians. But this did not mean he supported tyranny: the Tsar should listen to his people, and the monarch and the people should come to peace. In February, in the Perm region, the Bolsheviks began to loot churches and monasteries. When the second session of the Council ended, Andronic returned to Perm. Patriarch Tikhon had elevated him to archbishop on April 25, Palm Sunday. On Holy Thursday, April 16, the Bolsheviks carried out a search of his residence. He remained calm and continued the services of Holy Week and Pascha (Easter). The Bolshevik authorities increased pressure on the church in the following weeks. Finally Archbishop Andronik was arrested at midnight on July 4 (Gregorian calendar: July 17). In response, the clergy in Perm went on strike from the night he was arrested until July 13 (Gregorian: July 26), halting all divine services in the region except baptism and the last rites for the dying. There are various accounts of his death. The apparently most consistent says that on July 7, 1918 he was taken to the forest and forced to dig his own grave. After lying down in it, he was covered with earth and shots were fired into the dirt.

Life The grave of Rev William Laurence Brown, Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen Brown was born in Utrecht. His father was minister of the English church there, but was then appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at St Andrews, and returned to Scotland in 1757. His son went to the grammar school there, and then to the university. After passing through the divinity classes, he went in 1774 to the university of Utrecht, where he studied theology and civil law. In 1777 he was appointed to the English church in Utrecht, and about 1788 to the professorship of moral philosophy and ecclesiastical history in the university, to which was soon added the professorship of the law of nature. The war which followed the French Revolution drove Brown in January 1795 to London. In 1795 the magistrates of Aberdeen appointed him to the chair of divinity, and soon after he was made principal of Marischal College. In the year 1800 he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and in 1804 Dean of the Chapel Royal, and of the order of the Thistle. From 1824 to 1828 he was Patron of the Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen.

It originally was made for Tandy's TRS-DOS Operating System and for their TRS-80 line of computers, but eventually shifted to PC, where it was developed using C and Assembly. Like Windows (and other competitors from the time, such as GEM), it was not a full operating system, requiring a separate disk operating system in order to function. Although the initial PC ports would only run on Tandy's PCs (such as the Tandy 1000), the introduction of the true PC- compatible computers such as the Tandy 3000 resulted in the software later being made available for other compatibles. Some non-Tandy software used DeskMate to provide the user interface, and provided a runtime version of the operating environment for those without it. Examples included Activision's The Music Studio, and a version of Lotus 1-2-3.  DeskMate 1.0  DeskMate version 1.0 was included with the original Tandy 1000 and did not work correctly on non-Tandy computers. This was mainly due to the use of the function keys - as most non-Tandy PCs either did not come with an F12 button or with one that did not act in the same way as a Tandy F12 function key (Tandy adopted F11/F12 before IBM did). DeskMate was popular, increasing sales of the Tandy 1000 to homes and schools.  DeskMate 2  By the time Personal DeskMate was released with the Tandy 1000 EX, it was a GUI that acted as a portal for many other office productivity applications. The DeskMate application would run on top of MS-DOS. The user interface was made up of text. The applications that made up the suite were: *a basic word processor (\\"Text\\") *a spreadsheet (\\"Worksheet\\") *a calendar *a basic database program (\\"Filer\\") The programs all fit on a 360K floppy disk. With careful manipulation, it was possible to isolate the individual applications and remove the others, placing them on separate floppies to be swapped when required. DeskMate was still required, as the individual programs could not be accessed directly. DeskMate 3 DeskMate 3 added a number of interesting basic applications: *a drawing program (\\"Draw\\") *a simple digital audio editing program (\\"Sound\\") *a simple music program (\\"Music\\"), which could play music with audio samples created in Sound, used the 3-channel Tandy DAC, which provided 22 kHz 8-bit audio. *an online service (\\"PC Link\\") The core parts of DeskMate (and DOS) were shipped in ROM on certain Tandy 1000s, allowing the computer to boot into DeskMate within a few seconds. This was the first version of DeskMate that allowed for a run-time version that could be distributed with applications. This allowed users to use DeskMate applications on their PC's even if they did not have DeskMate installed. Professional DeskMate Tandy offered DeskMate for corporate users as an alternative to OS/2 Presentation Manager. Professional DeskMate provides a text-based GUI for DOS, with LocalTalk-based file-service and email extensions. WinMate This was a complete rewrite for Microsoft Windows 3.1, providing a simplified user interface and a few applications. Reception Noting that Tandy had found that Personal DeskMate increased sales of its 1000 computers, Stewart Alsop II in 1988 praised Tandy's strategy for Professional DeskMate as \\"brilliant: while IBM, Apple, and virtually the rest of the computing world focus almost exclusively on corporate and government business\\", Tandy \\"responds to the basic needs of small businesses and professional offices\\".

Fordham is part of the East Cambridgeshire district. It is four miles north of Newmarket, as well as being close to the settlements of Soham, Burwell, Isleham, Mildenhall and Chippenham. History Signpost in Fordham The parish of Fordham covers in an irregular shape. Its southern border is the county border with Suffolk and most of its south-eastern border with Snailwell follows the path of the River Snail. It also borders Chippenham and Isleham to the east, Soham to the north, and Burwell to the west, as well as having a short boundary with Wicken at its western tip. In 1953 the civil parish was merged with that of Landwade, a tiny parish of only , although Landwade and its ecclesiastical parish are both in Suffolk. The parish has been occupied for several thousand years; weapons and tools in both flint and metal have been found from the Early Bronze Age and Iron Age, as well as pottery and burials. Wall plaster and tiles have been found from the Roman era, indicating that villas may have been sited near to Biggin and Block Farms in the 2nd to 4th centuries A.D. In the Middle Ages the village was home to Fordham Priory, a Gilbertine priory and cell to Sempringham Priory, that was founded in the reign of Henry III in the 13th century by Robert de Fordham.Fordham, Cambridgeshire through time Fordham Abbey, a Grade II* listed Georgian manor house was built on the site of the Priory in the eighteenth century. Fordham had a railway station serving as a junction the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway and the Ipswich to Ely line that opened to the west of the village in 1879. The station finally closed in 1966. Though spelled Fordeham in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village's spelling has remained unchanged since the 10th century. The name \\"Fordham\\" means \\"homestead or enclosure by a ford\\". Fordham War Memorial commemorates the village's dead from the two world wars. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and originally featured a bronze statue of St George by Sir George Frampton. The memorial was destroyed and the bronze stolen in 1991 and the community raised funds to rebuild it and replace the bronze with a fibreglass replica. It is a Grade II listed building. Church The parish church has been dedicated to St Peter since around 1850, prior to which it had been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 14th century. The present building consists of a chancel with side chapels and a two-storeyed north chapel, an aisled and clerestoried nave with south porch and west tower. It is a Grade I listed building. The earliest parts of the building date from the 12th century, and stonework suggest that by 1200 it was already its present size. The majority of the current structure date from an extensive rebuild in the 13th century. The church is noted for its fine 14th-century north chapel, unusual in having an upper floor and undercroft. Village life The village has a Church of England-controlled Primary School which feeds into Soham Village College. Fordham has two pubs. The Chequers and The Crown, which were both open by 1760. The Greyhound, which opened in the 1990s, converted into a restaurant called The White Pheasant. Other former pubs include the Green Dragon (previously known as The Bull) on the Market Street green, which was also open by 1760 and closed by the 1960s. Fordham Community Archive has been set up to record the history of Fordham in the form of photographs, documents and written and oral memories. The group was formed in August 2007 and holds community events.  Environment  Fordham Woods nature reserve is located south of the village. Other details A Ham class minesweeper HMS Fordham is named after the village. The 'Hedgerow poet' James Withers lived in the village. Fordham is the birthplace of operatic bass-baritone Darren Jeffery. In 2007, villager Tracey Barnard was a contestant on Channel 4's Big Brother. Alison Bruce, another villager, has previously been on 'The Weakest Link'.

It is also known by other names including Iwama-ry≈´ (see: ry≈´). It is often associated with the term Takemusu after the martial concept. It is sometimes also referred to as Traditional or Dent≈ç (‰ºùÁµ±, lit. traditional). It is sometimes called Saito style, though never by Iwama stylists themselves as Saito insisted that he intended to preserve the founder's style. Ranks At one point Saito gave out specific \\"Iwama-ryu\\" ranks at the insistence of his European students. However, he always awarded ranks through the Aikikai out of respect for the Ueshiba family. Saito also gave out mokuroku (scrolls) for his aiki-ken and aiki-jo with levels loosely modeled after the traditional license system of classical Japanese martial arts to students independent of Iwama-ryu ranks. Today, Iwama style aikido organisations can be found both within and outside of the Aikikai. The main non-Aikikai branch is Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai, founded by Morihiro Saito's son Hitohiro Saito. It continues to issue Iwama Ryu grading certificates; however, many of Saito's longest students have remained affiliated with the Aikikai. In Europe some of these groups belong to the Takemusu Aikido Kyokai umbrella organisation. In the United States, the major organization is the Takemusu Aikido Association Style Iwama style includes the combined study (riai) of traditional Japanese weapons (bukiwaza), specifically Aiki-j≈ç (staff) and Aiki-ken (sword), and of empty-handed aikido(taijutsu), both accompanied by kiai. Iwama practitioners often claim that their aikido is close to that of the founder, as preserved by Morihiro Saito, largely based on photos taken from the Noma Dojo and a technical manual written by the founder. Among non-Iwama Aikikai practitioners, a common opinion is that Iwama style mainly is Morihei Ueshiba's aikido of the 1940s and 1950s not taking into consideration his later years, though Ueshiba resided in Iwama until his death there. Pedagogy Iwama style Aikido tends to be highly codified compared to most aikido practice. Weapons training, including kata, is stressed. Techniques are generally practiced first from a static grab and footwork is broken up into numbered steps. In addition weapons work involves many repetitions of suburi and paired weapons practice is practiced with a pause between each movement until students are relatively advanced. A great deal of emphasis is placed on a stable hanmi or stance in Iwama style aikido. . Every class in an Iwama style dojo begins with tai-no- henko and morotedori kokyu-ho and ends with kokyu-dosa. Several Iwama-Style dojo around the world, such as Aikido in Fredericksburg, offer live-in apprentice programs (\\"uchi-deshi programs\\") modeled after Saito's program in Iwama. Progression Saito believed in a progression from static techniques to the spontaneous takemusu aiki. Many Iwama style practitioners practice in stages, most often divided into: #Kihon (basic/foundational) or Kotai (static) practice #Yawarakai or Jutai (soft, flowing movement) #Ki-no- nagare (lit. the flow of ki) Prevalence outside of Japan Technical characteristics In certain stances, a slight tilt of the hips is characteristic of the style. The feet are kept on a line, but the front foot points forward rather than turned out (in contrast to the Yoshinkan) causing the hips to be slightly rotated. In jo work, the posture of hito-emi, or standing with a dramatically minimized profile facing the opponent, is another unique characteristic of Iwama aikido. Many techniques, especially techniques that begin from shomen-uchi, start with nage initiating a strike to uke in the basic form of the technique. This is common with the Yoshinkan, Manseikan, and Michio Hikitsuchi's basic practice and the founder's instruction in Budo, but opposite of how many other styles of Aikido teach the techniques. Even when uke is striking, it is emphasized that tori initiates the encounter. Saito referred to this as the \\"way of the mountain echo\\" (yamabiko no michi), presumably after a poem by the founder. In keeping with the above, most grabs in Iwama Aikido are formalized as a response to a threat from nage unlike in most aikido styles that start attacks with a grab. As a result Iwama style grabs are firm and static without pushing or pulling and with the intention of immobilizing the body. Suwari-waza in Iwama-style is started completely in seiza. This is in contrast to some other styles where the practitioners often start already on their toes (kiza). Iwama stylists employ kiai and atemi with great consistency. Koshi-nage in Iwama style aikido is always performed with the hips perpendicular to the uke and the hips acting as a fulcrum. In ukemi Iwama practitioners will usually attempt to parry the atemi being thrown by nage, which may or may not be encouraged in other styles of aikido. Rolls are usually performed with the rear leg tucked. Buki-waza (weapons technique) Focus on bukiwaza and riai (the relationship between weapons and taijutsu) is a hallmark of this style. Some of the bukiwaza practices were developed by O-sensei while others are Saito Sensei's distillation of O-Sensei's teachings and practices. Weapons practice includes suburi, awase (1-step paired exercises), solo and paired kata, and tanren-uchi (striking a log or tire) with the jo and wooden sword. Though not formally part of the curriculum, Saito shihan practiced Negishi-ryu and shuriken is also sometimes practiced. The sword forms of Iwama style are generally recognized as being descended from Kashima Shinto-ryu sword techniques. In particular the first two kumitachi are nearly identical in the sequence of cuts to forms from Kashima Shinto-ryu. It is also believed that Yagyu style had influence through Masakatsu Nakai's instruction of Ueshiba. It has been widely observed that the ken-tai-jo are remarkably similar to spear techniques of Kukishin-ryu. Ueshiba was close friends with the Kuki family; this, along with the spear-like handling of the jo in Iwama-style, has lead to speculation that Kukishin-ryu spear is partially the basis of Aiki-jo, though there is not enough Ueshiba formally studied the art in any depth. Ara-Waza and Henka-Waza Ara-waza, literally coarse techniques, are occasionally practiced by Iwama style Aikido practitioners. These techniques are intended to explicitly show the injurious applications latent in Aikido techniques and include simple kicks targeting the knees and entangling or twisting joints during throws with the option to break them. Some henka-waza (modified basic techniques) in Iwama style Aikido also include entangling joints, locking large joints, strikes to vital points, and occasionally chokes using the arm or the partner's dogi. For safety reasons these are never performed fully.

It first flew on 24 August 1933 and went into service with the Fleet Air Arm, Royal Canadian Air Force, Portuguese Navy, and the British Air Observers' School, but was already obsolescent by 1937 and in the following year, replacement by the Fairey Swordfish began. Design and development The Blackburn T.9 Shark was designed and built, initially as a private venture, to Air Ministry Specification S.15/33 for a torpedo-spotter-reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm. It had a crew of three, with the observer/wireless operator and gunner sharing the second cockpit (open on Mks I and II, enclosed on Mk III). Armament consisted of one fixed, forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun, plus a .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K machine gun or Lewis Gun mounted on a Scarff ring in the rear cockpit, with provision for a torpedo or equivalent bombload carried externally. The Blackburn \\"B-6\\" prototype with a Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV was flown at Brough on 24 August 1933.Taylor 1969, p. 322. The aircraft subsequently began Naval aviation tests at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;), RAF Martlesham Heath on 26 November 1933. The following year, deck landing trials on proved successful with Blackburn winning an order from the Fleet Air Arm in August 1934, to contract No 334315/34 and the new Specification 13/35. I, and further contract No 510994/35 to Specification 19/36 issued in January 1937. The prototype was subsequently fitted with twin floats and was test-flown at Brough in April 1935 with successful sea trials taking place at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment Felixstowe. More contracts followed, and during the three years of production, 238 Sharks were delivered to the Fleet Air Arm, comprising 16 Mk I (Tiger IV), 126 Mk II (760 hp/567 kW Tiger VI) and 95 Mk III (760 hp/570 kW Tiger VI).Thetford 1978, p.55. Operational history Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Shark in company with a Westland Wapiti, seen flying over The Shark entered service with 820 Naval Air Squadron in May 1935, replacing Fairey Seals, equipping a further two squadrons (810 and 821) in 1936. Frontline service was short-lived, the type being replaced by the Fairey Swordfish in 1937.Mason 1994, p.243. At least 22 Mk IIs and IIIs (all brought up to Mk III standard) were converted in 1937/38 as target tugs and operated in this role and for training and communications until 1942. Sharks based in RAF Seletar as target tugs were used for patrol missions and bombing raids against Japanese invaders over Malaya in January 1942.Shores Cull and Izawa 1992, pp. 276, 337‚Äì338, 340. Canadian Sharks The RCAF purchased seven Blackburn Shark II (760 hp/570 kW Tiger VI) in 1936 for service with No 6 (TB) Squadron, later operating as No 6 (BR) Sqn on shipping patrols off the Canadian west coast. Two Blackburn Shark IIIs (800 hp/600 kW Pegasus III) were supplied to RCAF by Blackburn in 1939 as forerunners of 17 similar aircraft built by Boeing Aircraft of Canada at Vancouver, with Pegasus IX and used by Nos 6 and 4 (BR) Squadrons. RCAF Blackburn Sharks, some of which operated as floatplanes, were withdrawn from service in August 1944 and five were then transferred to the RN Air Observers' School in Trinidad.

On 7 October 2007, SAP AG announced that it would acquire BusinessObjects for $6.8B. As of 22 January 2008, the corporation is fully operated by SAP; this was seen as part of a growing consolidation trend in the business software industry, with Oracle acquiring Hyperion in 2007 and IBM acquiring Cognos in 2008. BusinessObjects had two headquarters in San Jose, California, and Paris, France, but their biggest office was in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company's stock was traded on both the Nasdaq and Euronext Paris (BOB) stock exchanges.  Legal  On April 2, 2007, a lawsuit from Informatica (inherited by BusinessObjects from the purchase of Acta Technologies in 2002) resulted in an award of $25 million in damages to Informatica for patent infringement. The lawsuit related to embedded data flows with one input and one output. Informatica asserted that the ActaWorks product (now sold by BusinessObjects as part of Data Integrator), infringed several Informatica patents including US Patent Nos. 6,014,670 and 6,339,775, both titled \\"Apparatus and Method for Performing Data Transformations in Data Warehousing.\\" BusinessObjects subsequently released a new version of Data Integrator (11.7.2) which removed the infringing product capability.

According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: \\"This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements.\\" EMDR is included in several evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As of 2020, the American Psychological Association lists EMDR as an evidence-based treatment for PTSDPsychological Treatments, Association of Clinical Psychologists, Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, accessed 25 March 2020 but stresses that \\"the available evidence can be interpreted in several ways\\" and notes there is debate about the precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to relieve PTSD symptoms with some evidence EMDR may simply be a variety of exposure therapy.  History  EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of a disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1989. Her hypothesis was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal coping mechanisms, with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network. Shapiro noted that, when she was experiencing a disturbing thought, her eyes were involuntarily moving rapidly. She further noted that her anxiety was reduced when she brought her eye movements under voluntary control while thinking a traumatic thought. Shapiro developed EMDR therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. She speculated that traumatic events \\"upset the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, causing a pathological change in the neural elements\\".  Delivery  Shapiro over time developed an eight-stage process for EMDR, with various additions being made to the core EMDR practice itself. EMDR is typically undertaken in a series of sessions with a trained therapist.UK Nice guidelines: 1.6.20 EMDR for adults should: be based on a validated manual typically be provided over 8 to 12 sessions, but more if clinically indicated, for example if they have experienced multiple traumas be delivered by trained practitioners with ongoing supervision be delivered in a phased manner and include psychoeducation about reactions to trauma; managing distressing memories and situations; identifying and treating target memories (often visual images); and promoting alternative positive beliefs about the self use repeated in-session bilateral stimulation (normally with eye movements[1]) for specific target memories until the memories are no longer distressing include the teaching of self-calming techniques and techniques for managing flashbacks, for use within and between sessions. [2018] The number of sessions can vary depending on the progress made. A typical EMDR therapy session lasts from 60-90 minutes.https://www.emdria.org/about-emdr-therapy/experiencing- emdr-therapy/ However self-administration also occurs.Self-Guided EMDR Therapy & Workbook: Healing from Anxiety, Anger, Stress, Depression, PTSD & Emotional Trauma, by Katherine Andler, 2018Self-EMDR: The Complete Therapeutic Approach - At Last. Eliminate Painful Emotions For A Lifetime. Simple. Easy. Effective Kindle Edition by Desmond Long, 2015  Medical uses   Trauma and PTSD  The person being treated is asked to recall distressing images while generating one of several types of bilateral stimulation|bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping. The 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline says that \\"Like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of beliefs, (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework.\\"  Evidence of effectiveness  While multiple meta-analyses have found EMDR to be as effective as trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of PTSD, these findings have been regarded as tentative given the low numbers in the studies, high risk rates of researcher bias, and high dropout rates. * A 1998 meta-analysis found that EMDR was as effective as exposure therapy and SSRIs. * A 2002 meta-analysis concluded that EMDR is not as effective, or as long lasting, as traditional exposure therapy. * A 2005 and a 2006 meta-analysis each suggested that traditional exposure therapy and EMDR have equivalent effects immediately after treatment and at follow-up. * Two meta-analyses in 2006 found EMDR to be at least equivalent in effect size to specific exposure therapies. * A 2009 review of rape treatment outcomes concluded that EMDR had some efficacy. Another 2009 review concluded EMDR to be of similar efficacy to other exposure therapies and more effective than SSRIs, problem-centered therapy, or \\"treatment as usual\\". * A 2010 meta- analysis concluded that all \\"bona fide\\" treatments were equally effective, but there was some debate regarding the study's selection of which treatments were \\"bona fide\\". * A Cochrane systematic review comparing EMDR with other psychotherapies in the treatment of Chronic PTSD, found EMDR to be just as effective as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TFCBT) and more effective than the other non-TFCBT psychotherapies. Caution was urged interpreting the results due to low numbers in included studies, risk of researcher bias, high drop out rates, and overall \\"very low\\" quality of evidence for the comparisons with other psychotherapies. * A 2013 systematic review examined 15 clinical trials of EMDR with and without the eye movements, finding that the effect size was larger when eye movements were used. Again, interpretation of this meta-analysis was tentative. Lee and Cuijpers (2013) stated that \\"the quality of included studies was not optimal. This may have distorted the outcomes of the studies and our meta-analysis. Apart from ensuring adequate checks on treatment quality, there were other serious methodological problems with the studies in the therapy context.\\" A metanalsysis in 2020, could not confirm the results of this 2013 study, due to \\"differences in inclusion criteria.\\" *A 2020 systematic review and meta- analysis was the \\"first systematic review of randomized trials examining the effects of EMDR for any mental health problem.\\" The authors raised concerns about bias in previous studies, concluding:  Position statements  The 2009 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies practice guidelines categorized EMDR as an evidence-based level A treatment for PTSD in adults. Other guidelines recommending EMDR therapy ‚Äì as well as CBT and exposure therapy ‚Äì for treating trauma have included NICE starting in 2005,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2016).

New York: Guilford Press. and the World Health Organization in 2013 (only for PTSD, not for acute stress treatment). The American Psychological Association \\"conditionally recommends\\" EMDR for the treatment of PTSD.  Children  EMDR is included in a 2009 practice guideline for helping children who have experienced trauma. EMDR is often cited as a component in the treatment of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. A 2017 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in children and adolescents with PTSD found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and superior to waitlist or placebo.  Other conditions  Several small studies have indicated EMDR efficacy for other mental health conditions, but more research is needed. Depression Studies have indicated EMDR effectiveness in depression. A 2019 review found that \\"Although the selected studies are few and with different methodological critical issues, the findings reported by the different authors suggest in a preliminary way that EMDR can be a useful treatment for depression.\\" Anxiety related disorders Small studies have found EMDR to be effective with GAD, OCD, other anxiety disorders, and distress due to body image issues. Other conditions EMDR may have application for psychosis when co-morbid with trauma, Other studies have investigated EMDR therapy‚Äôs efficacy with borderline personality disorder, and somatic disorders such as phantom limb pain. EMDR has also been found to improve stress management symptoms. EMDR has been found to reduce suicide ideation, and help low self-esteem. Other studies focus on effectiveness in substance craving and pain management. EMDR may help people with autism who suffer from exposure to distressing events. Reviews A 2013 overall literature review covered research up to that time. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis was the \\"first systematic review of randomized trials examining the effects of EMDR for any mental health problem.\\" The authors concluded: \\"it is evident that the long-term effects of EMDR are unclear, and... there is certainly not enough evidence to advise its use in patients with mental health problems other than PTSD.\\"  Mechanism  Possible mechanisms The proposed mechanisms that underlie eye movements in EMDR therapy are still under investigation and there is as yet no definitive finding. * Many proposals share an assumption that, as Shapiro posited, when a traumatic or very negative event occurs, information processing of the experience in memory may be incomplete. The trauma causes a disruption of normal adaptive information processing, which results in unprocessed information being dysfunctionally held in memory networks. According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: \\"This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories.\\" Proposed mechanisms posit that EMDR can assist to successfully alleviate clinical complaints by processing the components of the contributing distressing memories.https://www.emdr.com/theory/ Doing EMDR allows the client to access and reprocess negative memories (leading to decreased psychological arousal associated with the memory). This is sometimes known as the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model. The mechanism by which EMDR achieves this effect is unknown. ** One proposal is that EDMR achieves this effect through impacting working memory. The proposal is that the degradation in working memory causes a distancing effect, enabling the client to 'stand back' from the trauma. This enables the client to re-evaluate the trauma and their understanding of it, because they can re-experience it whilst not feeling overwhelmed by it. This effect may be achieved by bilateral stimulation. By having the patient perform a bilateral stimulation task while retrieving memories of trauma, the amount of information they can retrieve about the trauma is limited, and thus the resulting negative emotions are less intense. ** Bilateral stimulation may have other effects (see below). ** Another proposal is that EMDR enables ‚Äòdual attention‚Äô (recalling the trauma whilst keeping ‚Äòone foot in the present‚Äô assisted by BLS), allowing the brain to access the dysfunctionally stored experience and stimulate the innate processing system, allowing it to transform the information to an adaptive resolution. ** Other commentators compare EMDR to the effects of sleep, and posit that traumatic experiences are processed during sleep. A slowing of brain waves has been seen during bilateral stimulation (eye movement), somewhat similar to what occurs during sleep. A possibly related finding is that brain waves during EMDR treatment shows changes in brain activity, specifically the limbic system showed its highest level of activity prior to commencing EMDR treatment. ** An earlier suggestion was that horizontal eye movement triggers an evolutionary 'orienting approach' in the brain, used in scanning the environment for threats and opportunities. * Another approach is that trauma can be overcome or mastered, and that EMDR facilitates a form of mindfulness or other form of mastery over the trauma. A 2013 meta-analysis focused on two mechanisms: (1) taxing working memory and (2) orienting response/REM sleep. It may be that several mechanisms are at work in EMDR.  Questions about eye movement and bilateral stimulation  Bilateral stimulation is a generalization of the left and right repetitive eye movement technique first used by Shapiro. These alternative stimuli include auditory stimuli that alternate between left and right speakers or headphones, and physical stimuli such as tapping of the therapist's hands. Research has attempted to correlate other types of rhythmic side-to-side stimuli, such as sound and touch, with mood, memory and cerebral hemispheric interaction. A small 1996 study found that the eye movements employed in EMDR did not add to its effectiveness. A 2000 review found that the eye movements did not play a central role, and that the mechanisms of eye movements were speculative. A 2001 meta-analysis suggested that EMDR with the eye movements was no more efficacious than EMDR without the eye movements (Davidson & Parker, 2001). Salkovskis in 2002 reported that the eye movement is irrelevant, and that the effectiveness of EMDR was solely due to its having properties similar to CBT, such as desensitization and exposure. However a 2012 review found that the evidence provided support for the contention that eye movements are essential to this therapy and that a theoretical rationale exists for their use. A 2013 meta-study found the effect size of eye movement was large and significant, with the strongest effect size difference being for vividness measures. As of 2020, the most recent and robust experiments call into question the consistency and generalizability of the technique.  Criticisms  As early as 1999, EMDR was controversial within the psychological community, and it has continued to be so. Effectiveness and theoretical basis Concerns have included questions about its effectiveness and the importance of the eye movement component of EMDR. In 2012, Hal Arkowitz, and Scott Lilienfeld summed up the state of the research at the time, saying that while EMDR is better than no treatment and probably better than merely talking to a supportive listener, Pseudoscience Skeptics of the therapy argue that EMDR is a pseudoscience, because the underlying theory is unfalsifiable. Also, the results of the therapy are non-specific, especially if the eye movement component is irrelevant to the results. What remains is a broadly therapeutic interaction and deceptive marketing. According to Yale neurologist Steven Novella: Excessive training Shapiro has been criticized for repeatedly increasing the length and expense of training and certification, allegedly in response to the results of controlled trials that cast doubt on EMDR's efficacy. This included requiring the completion of an EMDR training program in order to be qualified to administer EMDR properly, after researchers using the initial written instructions found no difference between no-eye-movement control groups and EMDR-as-written experimental groups. Further changes in training requirements and/or the definition of EMDR included requiring level II training when researchers with level I training still found no difference between eye-movement experimental groups and no-eye-movement controls and deeming \\"alternate forms of bilateral stimulation\\" (such as finger-tapping) as variants of EMDR by the time a study found no difference between EMDR and a finger-tapping control group. Such changes in definition and training for EMDR have been described as \\"ad hoc moves [made] when confronted by embarrassing data\\".

These payments are typically executed electronically as a direct deposit through a national payment system, operated by the banks or in conjunction with the government. Payment is typically initiated by the payer but can also be set up as a direct debit. In addition to the bill payment facility, most banks will also offer various features with their electronic bill payment systems. These include the ability to schedule payments in advance to be made on a specified date (convenient for installments such as mortgage and support payments), to save the biller information for reuse at a future time and various options for searching the recent payment history. In many cases the payment data can also be downloaded and posted directly into the customer's accounting or personal finance software. History Although this technology was available from the mid 1990s, uptake was initially slow until internet access by households increased. By 2000, adoption of electronic bill payment systems started to dramatically increase. Impact From the consumer's point of view, electronic payment of bills is cheaper, faster, and more convenient than writing, posting and reconciling cheques. In addition, though limitations exist, a wider range of bank accounts or credit cards can be used for the electronic payment of bills. Using electronic bill presentment and payment enables businesses to fast-track customer payments and get access to funds faster, which in turn results in cash flow improvement. For banks the advantages of electronic bill payments are a reduction in processing costs minimizing paperwork and an increase in customer loyalty. In a 2003 study, the banks said that \\"customers who pay online show more loyalty and are more receptive to other offers\\".

As in earlier works, Grass concerns himself with the effects of the past on the present; he interweaves various strands and combines fact and fiction. While the murder of Wilhelm Gustloff by David Frankfurter and the sinking of the ship the Wilhelm Gustloff are real events, the fictional members of the Pokriefke family bring these events into our own time. Title The title, Crabwalk, defined by Grass as \\"scuttling backward to move forward,\\" refers to both the necessary reference to various events, some occurring at the same time, the same events that would lead to the eventual disaster. Crabwalk might also imply a more abstract backward glance at history, in order to allow a people to move forward. The protagonist's awkward relationships with his mother and his estranged son, explored via the crabbed process of scouring the wreckage of history for therapeutic insight, lends appropriateness to the title. Plot summary The narrator of the novella is the journalist Paul Pokriefke, who was born on 30 January 1945 on the day that the Strength Through Joy ship, the Wilhelm Gustloff, was sunk. His young mother-to-be, Tulla Pokriefke (born in Danzig, and already known to readers from two parts of the Danzig Trilogy, Cat and Mouse and Dog Years), found herself among the more than 10,000 passengers on the ship and was among those saved when it went down. According to Tulla, Paul was born at the moment the ship sank, on board the torpedo boat which had rescued them. His life is heavily influenced by these circumstances, above all because his mother Tulla continually urges him to fulfill his 'duty' and to commemorate the event in writing. In the course of his research, the narrator discovers by chance that his estranged son Konrad (Konny) has also developed an interest in the ship as a result of Tulla's influence. On his website ('blutzeuge.de') he explores the murder of Gustloff and the sinking of the ship, in part through a dialogue in which he adopts the role of Gustloff, and that of David Frankfurter is taken by another young man, Wolfgang Stremplin. The two eventually meet in Schwerin, Konny's and Gustloff's hometown. Wolfgang, though not Jewish, projects a Jewish persona. He spits three times on the former memorial to Gustloff, thus desecrating it in Konny's eyes. Konny shoots him dead, mirroring the shooting of Gustloff by Frankfurter; after the deed he hands himself in to the police and states that, \\"I shot because I am a German\\"; Frankfurter had said, \\"I shot because I am a Jew\\". The narrator is eventually forced to realise that his imprisoned son has himself become a new martyr, and is celebrated as such by neo-Nazis on the Internet. Characters Konrad Pokriefke Konrad (known as \\"Konny\\") is the son of Paul Pokriefke and Gabi; after his parents' divorce, Konny is brought up by his left-wing mother and has little contact with his father. Highly intelligent, he is characterised as a 'loner' by his parents. He has a very good relationship with Tulla, who tells him stories of the ship, and with whom he eventually goes to live. Via his website he forms a love-hate relationship with Wolfgang: divided by their political views, they are nevertheless connected by similar characters and a love for table-tennis. At his trial he claims that he has nothing against Jews themselves, but that he considers their presence among Aryan populations to be a 'foreign body'; his father considers that he has a 'slow-burning' hatred for the Jews. Tulla Pokriefke Tulla (short form of Ursula) is short, thin, white-haired since the sinking of the ship, and attractive to men even into old age. Politically she is difficult to classify, except as an extremist: on the one hand she repeatedly praises the 'classless society' of the Strength Through Joy ship and supports her grandson even after the murder; on the other hand, she becomes a model functionary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in East Germany, weeping on the news of Joseph Stalin's death. Tulla speaks with a strong accent (a form of Low German described by the narrator as 'Langfursch', after the part of Danzig she is from). She seeks at every opportunity to put the story of the ship into the public domain, because it was the subject of silence for so long. When her attempts to persuade her son to write about the disaster fail, she turns her attention instead to her grandson. She also supplies Konny with the weapon which he uses in the murder, after he is threatened by neo-Nazi skinheads. The old one The mysterious figure of the old one stands between Grass and the narrator Paul. Belonging to the generation of those who fled west after the end of the war, he encourages Paul to write of the sinking as a substitute for his own failure to do so. The narrator refers to him as his \\"employer\\" or \\"boss\\". The possibility of identifying him with Grass serves to prevent the equation of the narrator with the author. References * Crabwalk.

Family His parents were James Turner Wells (1772 - 1838) and Jane Sears (? - 1832).Ancestry Website, London Parish Records On 15 July 1825 he married Emily Jane Hill (1807 - 1872), the daughter of a school-teacher. Their children were: *Emily Jane (1827 - 1885) *Anna Maria (1828 - 1903) *Florence Hazlitt (1832 - 1835) *Charles James Llewellyn (1834 - 1836) *Florence Llewellyn (1837 - ?) * Charles De Ville Wells (b. 1841 -1922), gambler, one of the men who broke the bank at Monte Carlo Life He was born in Pentonville, London, on 25 January 1799.Ancestry website: London Parish Birth Records He was educated at Cowden Clarke's school at Edmonton, with Tom Keats, the younger brother of the poet, and with RH Horne. He became acquainted with John Keats, and was the friend who sent him some roses, to whom Keats wrote a sonnet on 29 June 1816: \\"When, O Wells! thy roses came to me, My sense with their deliciousness was spelled; Soft voices had they, that, with tender plea, Whisperd of peace and truth and friendliness unquelled.\\" Wells soon afterwards played a practical joke on the dying Tom Keats, and reappears in the elder poet's correspondence as \\"that degraded Wells.\\" Both with Keats and Reynolds, Wells was in direct literary emulation, and his early writings were the result of this. In 1822 he published Stories after Nature-- or rather, in the manner of Boccaccio, tempered by that of Leigh Hunt. At the close of 1823, under the pseudonym of H. L. Howard, appeared the Biblical drama Of Joseph and his Brethren (dated 1824). For the next three years Wells saw William Hazlitt, as he said, every night, but in 1827 the two men were estranged. When Hazlitt died, in September 1830, Wells took Horne to see his dead friend, and afterwards raised a monument to the memory of Hazlitt in the church of St Annes, Soho. His two books passed almost unnoticed. Wells was now practising as a solicitor in London, but he thought that his health was failing and proceeded to South Wales, where he occupied himself with shooting, fishing and writing poetry until 1835, when he removed to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. In 1841 he left England, never to set foot in it again. He settled at Quimper, in Brittany, where he lived for some years. A story called Claribel appeared in 1845, and one or two slight sketches later, but several tragedies and a great deal of miscellaneous verse belonging to these years are lost. Wells stated in a letter to Horne (November 1877) that he had composed eight or ten volumes of poetry during his life, but that, having failed to find a publisher for any of them, he burned the manuscripts at his wife's death. The only work he had retained was a revised form of Joseph and his Brethren, which was praised in 1838 by Thomas Wade, and again, with great warmth, by Horne, in his New Spirit of the Age, in 1844. The drama was then once more forgotten, until in 1863 it was read and praised by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The tide turned at last; Joseph and his Brethren became a kind of shibboleth‚Äîa rite of initiation into poetic culture. Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a study of it in the Fortnightly Review in 1875, and the drama itself was reprinted in 1876. Between 1876 and 1878 Wells added various scenes, which came in the possession of Buxton Fornian, who published one of them in 1895. After leaving Quimper, Wells went to reside at Marseilles, where he held a professorial chair. Swinburne said that there are lines in Wells \\"which might more naturally be mistaken, even by an expert, for the work of the young Shakespeare, than any to be gathered elsewhere in the fields of English poetry.\\" In 1909 a reprint was published of Joseph and his Brethren, with Swinburne's essay, and reminiscences by Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton.

In the 19th century, defensive measures were taken to prevent flooding of the upper valley. Shingle was regularly dug from the mouth of the river and the banks were made higher. In 1846, the course of the river was straightened in an artificial cut; the cut mostly prevented flooding upstream, which used to reach to the village of Alfriston. It also provided support for irrigation.\\"'Dangerous message' over Cuckmere's future\\", Sussex Express Series (Lewes, England), 19 January 2008, accessed 29 October 2010 In addition, raised river banks, or levees, were constructed to protect areas from flooding. In recent decades, the area has become a major tourist destination, with tourism contributing to the local economy more than does agriculture. In the last decade, the Cuckmere Estuary Partnership was established as a collaboration of the National Trust, Natural England, Environment Agency, East Sussex County Council, Sussex Wildlife Trust, and various other environmental and conservation groups. They are working together to create long-term plans for the natural area. Government guidelines prohibit continuing to maintain hard flood defences where houses are not at risk. In addition, there is growing scientific evidence that the area would be more ecologically rich if allowed to return to its natural state. The partnership and the Environment Agency have proposed estuary restoration, and have been talking to local residents, businesses and visitors about how to proceed in the future. Presently, a shingle beach and raised river banks prevent seawater from penetrating the uppermost areas of the Cuckmere Valley. But the Environment Agency projects that an expected sea level rise due to climate change will increase the already steep costs of physical reinforcement, and current measures will not be sufficient. They intend to stop repair of the levees and to allow the cycle of natural processes, including periodic flooding of the area.

However it was overtaken in the 14th century by Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne, which remains the main commercial centre of the region. History Beaujolais was a semi-autonomous fiefdom of the Lords of Beaujeu. The barony was acquired in the 9th century by Guillaume, Comte du Lyonnais and Count of Forez; on his death, his son B√©rard became the first Lord of Beaujeu.

In October 1981, he participated in the robbery of a Brink's armored car, along with members of the Black Liberation Army and Kathy Boudin, his partner. Gilbert was convicted of the murders of Nyack police officers Waverly Brown and Edward O'Grady and Brinks guard Peter Paige, who died in the robbery. Gilbert has one son, Chesa Boudin. Early life and education Gilbert grew up in a Jewish family in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He was an Explorer Scout, and his father was Post Leader, of a South Brookline Explorer Post. Inspired in his teens by the Greensboro sit-ins and other events of the Civil Rights Movement, he joined the Congress of Racial Equality at age seventeen. He entered Columbia University in 1962. In March 1965, Gilbert founded the Independent Committee on Vietnam (ICV) at Columbia. Later, in the same year, he co-founded the Columbia chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) which merged with ICV in the Fall of 1966, even though there was already a chapter set in place that was formed in the early 1960s. The SDS chapter founded by Gilbert became renowned.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 25 He traveled regularly to Harlem while working as a tutor, and saw Malcolm X speak at Barnard College in February 1965, experiences he describes as formative. Gilbert was one of the known attendees, by the FBI, at the Flint War Council.Federal Bureau of Investigation. (1976). Weather Underground organization; retrieved through FOIA pp. 382‚Äì83 Career After graduating from Columbia University in June 1966, Gilbert spent most of his days and evenings during the fall of 1967 downtown attending graduate school at the New School for Social Research, building an SDS chapter there or attending meetings at the New York SDS Regional Office. In addition, Gilbert spent his spare time studying Marx's Kapital and writing New Left theoretical papers on imperialism and U.S. domestic consumption, consumerism and \\"the new working- class\\". As Columbia SDS grew during the Spring 1967 term, Gilbert returned to the Columbia campus to offer a \\"radical education counter-course\\" for Columbia SDS freshmen and sophomores in a lounge in Ferris Booth Hall. Known by the late 1960s primarily as a young theorist, publishing articles in New Left Notes and other movement publications, he went on to play an organizing role in the April‚ÄìMay 1968 Columbia student strike. On April 4, 1968, Gilbert had his first arrest after walking into a police riot where 6 officers were engaged in a physical altercation with a rioter. Gilbert's charge was assaulting a police officer. Gilbert maintained that the officer scraped his hand when he tried to hit Gilbert in the head with his baton. His lawyer advised him to take a plea bargain, and Gilbert pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $50.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America:The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 41 During the Columbia strike, which began on April 23, 1968, Gilbert served as part of the strike team; since he had good relations with some of the faculty, he was called on to be a negotiator. At the time of the strike he was a graduate student at the New School for Social Research.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America:The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 52 In October 1969, he headed a Weather collective in Denver and was arrested twice. The first arrest occurred while he was passing out leaflets in front of a community college and his comrades were inside setting off a smoke bomb. The second arrest led to a charge of \\"assault with a deadly weapon\\" after arresting officers found a rock in his pocket.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 104 Weather Underground In 1969, SDS split into different ideological factions and Weatherman emerged, its purpose being to build armed struggle among young white Americans in support of the Black Panthers and other militant groups and also to oppose the war in Vietnam by means of activities intended to \\"Bring the War Home\\". Gilbert joined this group in 1969 with his friend Ted Gold, who later died in the March 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, along with fellow Weather members Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins. The group became clandestine, and the organization was renamed the Weather Underground. When Weather went underground, members often used money they already had or received from their family to fund their efforts. Gilbert cashed in his Israel bonds and half of that money went to supporting Weather and the other half was put into the Black Panther bail fund.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 156 David Gilbert joined the Bay Area collective living in a San Francisco apartment. He and another member were working on another group's car in spring of 1971 when they were approached by two men in suits claiming to be real-estate agents. The men asked a few questions and then left. Gilbert suspected that these men were actually FBI agents looking for information. After several meetings within the group, they decided to stay put for a while.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 157 After more suspiciously acting men started inquiring into the activities of other members, they decided to travel north. Although not on the group's coordinating committee (the Weather Bureau), Gilbert acted as a regional leader, spending at least some of these years in Colorado. The Weather Underground committed several small bombings directed toward governmental and business property and buildings. As support for the group began to wane on the left, the pace of actions lessened, and some members of the Weather Underground resurfaced in late 1976 and early 1977. Gilbert resurfaced briefly in Denver, Colorado, between 1977 and 1979. Denver is where he helped organize a Weather collective in October 1969. Before surfacing, he managed to get his criminal charges dropped so he did not face any legal penalties. Gilbert, however, did not think it was in the best interest of the movement for him to resurface.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, p. 243 Most Weather members were not prosecuted or did not serve time in prison despite having been sought by the police for years; police misconduct led to the dropping of many charges (see: COINTELPRO). Gilbert opted to continue his life underground. Gilbert and his partner, Kathy Boudin, remained active even following the birth of their son, Chesa Boudin, in August 1980., AT HOME WITH: \\"Bernadine Dohrn; Same Passion, New Tactics\\"], nytimes.com, November 18, 1993. Brink's robbery In the late 1970s or early 1980s Gilbert and other white activists joined the RATF (Revolutionary Armed Task Force), an alliance of white revolutionaries with, and under the leadership of, that unit of the Black Liberation Army (BLA). On October 20, 1981, the RATF participated along with several members of the BLA in an attempt to rob a Brinks armored car at the Nanuet Mall, near Nyack, New York. While Gilbert and Boudin waited in a U-Haul truck in a nearby parking lot, armed BLA members took another vehicle to the mall, where a Brinks truck was making a delivery. They confronted the guards and a shootout ensued, wounding guard Joe Trombino after he let off one shot and killing his co-worker, Peter Paige., AMBUSH: THE BRINKS ROBBERY OF 1981. The robbers then took $1.6 million in cash and raced to transfer this into the waiting U-Haul. The truck was soon stopped by a police roadblock. Gilbert and Boudin surrendered but when the officers tried to search the back of the vehicle BLA members emerged shooting. Two police officers, Waverly L. Brown and Edward J. O'Grady, died in the shootout. Gilbert fled the scene with other RATF and BLA members but was caught by police that day. He was convicted and sentenced in 1983 to 75 years for three counts of felony murder. In the years since Gilbert has often expressed regrets about the violence of the Brinks robbery and the deaths and wounds that resulted. Imprisonment Gilbert co-founded an inmate peer education program on HIV and AIDS in the Auburn Correctional Facility in 1987, and a similar, more successful project in Great Meadows Prison in Comstock following his transfer there. He has published book reviews and essays in a number of small/independent newspapers and journals, some of which were collected into the anthology No Surrender: Writings from an Anti-Imperialist Political Prisoner (Abraham Guillen Press) in 2004. He has also published longer single pieces on the topics of misleading AIDS conspiracy theories and white working-class political consciousness. The 2003 documentary The Weather Underground featured interview segments with Gilbert, raising his profile beyond those in the small political prisoner support network who have been following his progress since his incarceration. The DVD release of The Weather Underground features a longer interview with Gilbert as a bonus feature. Gilbert has served time in numerous upstate New York prisons and is currently incarcerated at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York. He is not eligible for parole until October 13, 2056. Contributions David Gilbert co-wrote the pamphlet U.S. Imperialism with David Loud. The pamphlet was used across the country as a study guide by SDSers. Gilbert co-wrote an article entitled \\"Praxis and the New Left\\". It appeared in the first issue of Praxis on February 13, 1967. The article, co-written with Bob Gottlieb and Gerry Tenney, was part of a longer position paper called the \\"Port Authority Statement\\". There is a mini- biography on David Gilbert on page 312 of the book Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, by Dan Berger. In an article published in the Columbia Daily Spectator on April 2, 1983, Bob Feldman wrote: \\"Beyond Brinks: David Gilbert Talks About the Robbery, the Underground, the Struggle\\". Gilbert was one of a small group that edited and rewrote Bill Ayers' initial draft of Prairie Fire. Explaining the book's purpose, Gilbert said, \\"We needed something to re-mobilize us, we needed to have an organization to fight imperialism.\\" Personal life Gilbert had a son with fellow Weather Underground member Kathy Boudin, in New York City in 1980. When Gilbert and Boudin were arrested for the Brink's robbery, their 14-month-old son, Chesa Boudin, was raised in Chicago by adoptive parents Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who, like his parents, had been members of the Weather Underground. After a distinguished academic career and work as a public defender, in 2019, Chesa was elected District Attorney of San Francisco.

In the 1980s AST designed add-on expansion cards, and toward the 1990s evolved into a major personal computer manufacturer. By the late 1990s AST was acquired by Samsung, but was forced to close shortly after due to a series of losses. History AST Screen Print Logo on custom chip. AST's original business was the manufacture and marketing of a broad range of microcomputer expansion cards, later focusing on higher-density replacements for the standard I/O cards in the IBM PC. A typical AST multifunction card of the mid-1980s would have an RS-232 serial port, a parallel printer port, a battery-backed clock/calendar (the original IBM PC did not have one), a game port, and 384 KB of DRAM (added to the 256 KB on the motherboard to reach the full complement of 640 KB) - marketed under the product name 'SixPakPlus'. A similar expansion card was produced for the 8-bit Apple II, named the AST Multi I/O, which offered a serial and parallel interface, plus a battery-backed clock/calendar. In 1987 AST produced a pair of expansions cards for the Apple IIGS computer: The RamStakPlus, a dual RAM/ROM memory expansion card; and the AST Vision Plus, a real-time video capture card. The latter card was eventually sold to Silicon & Software and licensed and sold through Virtual Realities (and later LRO and then Alltech Electronics). AST Research also produced for the Macintosh line the Mac286, a pair of NuBus cards containing an Intel 80286 and RAM, allowing a Macintosh to run MS-DOS side by side with its existing operating system. These cards were announced in March 1987 alongside Apple's Macintosh II line. The product line was eventually sold to Orange Micro, which developed the concept further. As PC manufacturers improved the integration of peripheral controllers on their motherboards, AST's original business began to shrink, and the company developed its own line of PCs, for the desktop, mobile, and server markets. AST was one of the members of the Gang of Nine which developed the EISA bus. In 1992 AST became a Fortune 500 company at place 431. AST computer's reliability was considered close to that of quality leaders Compaq, Gateway, and IBM. AST gained a decent share of the PC market, but never came close to overtaking Compaq and Dell. During 1992-1995, AST owned the largest market share in China with Legend (now Lenovo) as the largest local reseller of AST computer. In 1993 Radio Shack sold its computer manufacturing division to AST, and in 1994 they reached a deal to sell AST computers in Radio Shack stores. A year later, the electronics chain started selling IBM-brand computers instead. AST's fortunes shrunk due to the strategy of offering premium models in an increasingly competitive personal computer market, while Compaq Computer Corporation and other top-tier manufacturers slashed prices to go head-to-head with the cheapest clones. The failure of AST to recognize the movement towards the commoditization of the PC contributed to its downturn. AST insisted on developing and using its own components in the PCs it produced, instead of those of specialized OEMs. One often used saying at AST, in an attempt to dismiss such competitors, was \\"the best technology they have is a screwdriver.\\" By the mid-1990s, AST had severe problems in the highly competitive PC market. Revenues for 1996 were $2.104 billion, down from 1995 revenues of $2.348 billion. AST Research was acquired by Samsung in 1997. At the time, Samsung owned 46 percent of AST and had offer to buy remaining common shares. Prior to this move, Samsung had already owned a substantial stake and provided considerable financial support to keep AST going. By December, the number of employees was down to 1,900. In 1999, Samsung was forced to close the California-based computer maker after a string of losses and a mass defection of research talent. Samsung had invested one billion US dollars in the company. The AST name was sold to Packard Bell. AST sponsored the English football club Aston Villa from 1995 to 1998. AST Computers, LLC In January 1999, the name and intellectual property were acquired by a new company named AST Computers, LLC. AST Computers, LLC was a private company founded in 1999 when Beny Alagem, founder of Packard Bell Electronics, bought the name and intellectual property of AST Research, Inc. AST Computers disappeared from the market in 2001. As of early 2011, the dormant AST trademark appears to be being relaunched by a new, independent company named DATA ACCESS based in France.

The destroyer was laid down on 26 June 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California and launched on 21 September 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Sofia R. de Veyra, both before the end of World War I. However, the vessel was commissioned on 28 May 1919, with Commander Edmund S. Root in command, after the end of the war the previous November. Joining the Pacific Fleet upon commissioning, Rizal cruised along the United States west coast into 1920 on exercises and training duty. Subsequently modified for service as a light minelayer, she was classified DM-14 on 17 July 1920. Rizal departed San Diego on 25 March 1920 for the Far East. Calling at Honolulu, Midway, and Guam, Rizal arrived Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 1 May 1920 to assume the duties of flagship of the Mine Detachment Division of the Asiatic Fleet. With Filipinos constituting the majority of her crew, Rizal remained on the Asiatic Station for ten years. She spent long months anchored in Chinese ports during the spring, summer, and autumn months. Her most frequent ports of call were Shanghai, Chefoo, Chinwangtao, and Hong Kong. Rizal cruised eastward to Apra Harbor, Guam, during November 1928, and visited Yokohama, Japan, from 11 to 20 April 1929. Rizal spent each winter generally from November through March, anchored in Manila Bay. She was docked annually at Olongapo and upon resuming active service each spring operated in Philippine waters. Ordered home late in 1930, Rizal departed Manila on 11 December 1930 for Guam, Honolulu, and San Diego. She decommissioned on 20 August 1931 at San Diego and was towed northward to Mare Island on 31 August 1931 by the minesweeper to be placed in reserve.

Its forerunner was started in 1899, when Sicilian Arberesh immigrants Joseph, Luca and Felix Vaccaro, together with Salvador D'Antoni, began importing bananas to New Orleans from La Ceiba, Honduras. By 1915 the business had grown so large that it bought most of the ice factories in New Orleans in order to refrigerate its banana ships, leading to its president Joseph Vaccaro becoming known as the \\"Ice King\\". Along with the United Fruit Company, Standard Fruit played a significant role in the governments of Honduras and other Central American countries, which became known as \\"banana republics\\" due to the high degree of control which the fruit companies held over the nations. In 1926, the company changed its name from Standard Fruit Company to Standard Fruit & Steamship Company. Between 1964 and 1968, the company was acquired by the Castle & Cooke Corporation, which also acquired James Dole's Hawaiian Pineapple Company (HAPCO) around the same time. In 1991, Castle & Cooke was renamed Dole Food Company. Castle & Cooke Inc, a real estate company, was spun off in 1995 and, following a 2000 management buyout, is now privately held.

Biography Nicoll was born in Lumsden, Aberdeenshire, the son of Rev Harry Nicoll (1812‚Äì1891), a Free Church minister of Auchindoir, and his wife, Jane Robertson.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and graduated MA at the University of Aberdeen in 1870, and studied for the ministry at the Free Church Divinity Hall there until 1874, when he was ordained minister of the Free Church at Dufftown, Banffshire. Three years later he moved to Kelso, and in 1884 became editor of The Expositor for Hodder and Stoughton, a position which he held until his death. In 1885, Nicoll was forced to retire from pastoral ministry after an attack of typhoid had badly damaged his lung. In 1886, he moved south to London, which became the base for the rest of his life. With the support of Hodder and Stoughton he founded the British Weekly, a Nonconformist newspaper, which also gained great influence over opinion in the churches in Scotland. Nicoll secured many writers of exceptional talent for his paper (including Marcus Dods, J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Alexander Whyte, Alexander Maclaren, Carnegie Simpson and James Denney), to which he added his own considerable talents as a contributor. He began a highly popular feature, \\"Correspondence of Claudius Clear\\", which enabled him to share his interests and his reading with his readers. He was also the founding editor of The Bookman from 1891, and acted as chief literary adviser to Hodder and Stoughton. Among his other enterprises were The Expositor's Bible (originally published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1887‚Äì1896, but afterward reprinted in New York by A. C. Armstrong & Son) and The Theological Educator. He edited The Expositor's Greek Testament (from 1897). He also edited a series of Contemporary Writers (from 1894), and of Literary Lives (from 1904). He projected, but never wrote, a history of The Victorian Era in English Literature, and edited, with T. J. Wise, two volumes of Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century. He was knighted by King Edward VII in 1909, ostensibly for his literary work, but in reality probably more for his long-term support for the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1921 Birthday Honours. Nicoll was the father of Maurice Nicoll, a leading British psychologist and author who studied under Carl Jung and became a leading expositor of the teachings of the Greco-Armenian spiritual master G.I. Gurdjieff. He died on 4 May 1923 at his home, Bay Tree House in London. Family He married twice: firstly in 1878 to Isabella Dunlop (1857‚Äì1894); secondly in 1897 to Catherine Pollard (1863‚Äì1960). Children from the first marriage were Isa Constance Nicoll (1881‚Äì1963) an author and poet, and Henry Maurice Dunlop Nicoll (1884‚Äì1953) a noted psychiatrist. The one child of the second marriage was Mildred Robertson Nicoll (1898‚Äì1995).

The idea came from a lost work titled Inventio Fortunata, and the island features on maps from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including those of Gerardus Mercator and his successors. Mercator describes the island in a 1577 letter to John Dee: :In the midst of the four countries is a Whirl-pool, into which there empty these four indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the Earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel.

The earliest mention in an authentic historical authority occurs in the \\"Liber Pontificalis,\\", where the biography of Pope Simplicius (468‚Äì483) states that this pope \\"consecrated a basilica of the holy martyr Bibiana, which contained her body, near the 'palatium Licinianum' \\" (ed. Duchesne, I, 249). The Basilica of Santa Bibiana still exists. Legend According to legend, Bibiana was the daughter of a former prefect, Flavianus, who was banished by Julian the Apostate. His wife Dafrosa, and two daughters, Demetria and Bibiana, were also persecuted by Julian. Dafrosa and Demetria died a natural death and were buried by Bibiana in their own house; but Bibiana was tortured and died as a result of her sufferings. Two days after her death a priest named John buried Bibiana near her mother and sister in her home, the house being later transformed into a church. It is evident that the legend seeks to explain in this way the origin of the church and the presence in it of the bodies of the above-mentioned confessors. The account contained in the martyrologies of the ninth century is drawn from the legend.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Bibiana.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 15 Apr. 2013 Legnanino An alternate account says that in the year 363, Emperor Julian made Apronianus Governor of Rome. Bibiana suffered in the persecution started by him. She was the daughter of Christians, Flavian, a Roman knight, and Dafrosa, his wife. Flavian was tortured and sent into exile, where he died of his wounds. Dafrosa was beheaded, and their two daughters, Bibiana and Demetria, were stripped of their possessions and left to suffer poverty. However, they remained in their house, spending their time in fasting and prayer. Apronianus, seeing that hunger and want had no effect upon them, summoned them. Demetria, after confessing her faith, fell dead at the feet of the tyrant. Bibiana was reserved for greater sufferings. She was placed in the hands of a wicked woman called Rufina, who in vain endeavored to seduce her. She used blows as well as persuasion, but the Christian virgin remained faithful. Enraged at the constancy of this saintly virgin, Apronianus ordered her to be tied to a pillar and beaten with scourges, laden with lead plummets, until she died. The saint endured the torments with joy, and died under the blows inflicted by the hands of the executioner. Her body was then put in the open air to be torn apart by wild animals, yet none would touch it. After two days she was buried.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints, Volume XII, 1866 she is a saint from her faith Mistaken identity The above-mentioned Saint Bibiana (of the 4th century) should not be confused with Saint Vibiana (of the 3rd century), who is the patroness of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

A Democrat, Green served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1964 to 1977 and as the 94th Mayor of Philadelphia from 1980 to 1984. Youth Green grew up in the Kensington neighborhood's 33rd Ward with his brothers and sisters Mary, Anne, Michael, Dennis and Patrick. His father, William J. Green Jr., the dean of U.S congressmen from Philadelphia at his death, was among the most powerful Democratic members of the U.S. House. This upbringing gave Green and his siblings extraordinary access to top Democratic Party leaders. The Harry Truman Presidential Library website, for instance, contains a picture of the Green family meeting with Harry Truman in the White House. And the records of the administration of President John F. Kennedy frequently mention the senior Green as well. William J. Green III attended St. Joseph's Prep School and received his bachelor's degree from Saint Joseph's University in 1960. He also graduated from Villanova Law School. Congressional career At the age of 25, Green was elected as a Democrat in a special election on April 28, 1964, to the Eighty-eighth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father. He was reelected to six successive Congresses and served until January 3, 1977. Upon his election to Congress, Green and his wife Pat moved to Frankford. As a congressman in Lyndon B. Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" era, Green assumed leadership on issues such as meat inspection, rat control, and tax reform and led the charge in Congress to eliminate the oil depletion allowance. He voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and the Medicare Act of 1965, other pieces of President Johnson's sweeping program of domestic reform, and was one of the original cosponsors of the Equal Rights Amendment. He had a 100 percent rating from the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, and the Americans for Democratic Action for his fourteen years in Congress. Green served from December 1967, through December 1969, in his father's old post as Democratic city chairman but resigned after the Democratic City Committee refused to adopt his reform plan following a Republican sweep led by District Attorney and future U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for mayor of Philadelphia in 1971, losing to former Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo's \\"law and order\\" candidacy. In the 1972 congressional redistricting, Green's opponents tried to gerrymander him out of his seat, placing him in the same district as Congressman James Byrne, in office since 1952. The newly merged district had voted heavily for Rizzo in the mayoral election and had been represented mainly by Byrne, for whom Rizzo campaigned actively. The grassroots organization Green put together for his mayoral campaign, however, enabled him to defeat Byrne decisively. He was then easily re-elected in the overwhelmingly Democratic year of 1974. Senate campaign In 1976, U.S. Senator Hugh Scott, the Senate Republican leader, announced his retirement after being tarred in a campaign finance scandal and facing pressure from fellow Republicans Arlen Specter and John Heinz, who each coveted his seat. Green did not seek re-election to the House, and instead sought Scott's Senate seat. Backed by Governor Milton Shapp, Green won the Democratic nomination for the seat, defeating State Senator Jeanette Reibman of Northampton County. Green's fundraising skills, however, proved to be no match for the millions available to Heinz from his personal fortune after he defeated Arlen Specter in the Republican Senate primary. Heinz blasted Green for voting against defense budgets Green considered too expensive, implying that Green was weak on U.S. defense. Political cartoons of the time show Heinz pouring money from a giant ketchup bottle over Green's head. Even so, and with Carter at the top of the Democratic ticket, Heinz barely reversed the Democratic tide and defeated Green, 52‚Äì48 percent. After losing to Heinz, Green was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar, and he joined the now-defunct Philadelphia law firm Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, known for its lobbying and government relations practice. He moved out of his district to the Germantown section of Philadelphia and into the home of his mother-in-law, Margaret Sharpless Kirk, with his wife and children. They later moved to Chestnut Hill. As mayor He declined to run in the 1978 gubernatorial election but won the Democratic nomination for Mayor of Philadelphia in 1979, defeating runner-up Charles Bowser, former deputy mayor. Other candidates for the nomination, former City Controller William Klenk and former Commerce Director Al Gaudiosi, withdrew near the end of the primary. In the general election, Green defeated Republican David Marston, a former United States Attorney, and former City Councilman Lucien Blackwell, a future U.S. Congressman and the Consumer Party nominee, to win election as mayor. As mayor, Green was often forced by circumstances to make difficult and unpopular choices. He was required to balance a city budget still at a record high $285 million deficit inherited from Mayor Rizzo, the largest ever inherited by an incoming Philadelphia mayor. The resulting disputes with municipal labor unions, open battles with City Council, quiet disputes with campaign contributors, and an adversarial relationship with the mass media sapped his morale. \\"Reporters are the type of people who tore the wings off flies when they were young,\\" he complained at the time. His efforts to balance the budget were successful, however, and for the first time in years new businesses were choosing to relocate to Philadelphia, which won a national marketing award during the Green administration. In a city divided by race, Green appointed the first African American managing director, future Mayor Wilson Goode, aggressively supported Joseph Coleman as the first African American president of City Council, and appointed the first African American superintendent of the Philadelphia public schools, Constance Clayton. Another member of his cabinet was the city's first female city solicitor. The Green administration is also remembered for having brought young talent into the City government: Chaka Fattah received his first government job in Green's Commerce Department, one headed by Dick Doran; Ed Deseve, Green's finance director, went on to head the U.S. Office of Management and the Budget in the administration of President Bill Clinton; Bill Marrazo, a Green commissioner of the Philadelphia Water Department, is now president of WHYY, Philadelphia's principal public television station. Green decided not to seek re-election during the Democratic primary and concentrated on his family when his wife Patricia became pregnant. Pat Green was 40 and Green feared for her health and the health of his unborn child if she faced the stress of a political campaign during the pregnancy. After his youngest child, Maura Elizabeth Green, was born healthy near the end of his term, Green joked, \\"I am the winner\\" of the 1983 mayoral contest. Material in Mayor Green's city archives files include correspondence, reports, and other materials relating to the various city departments, boards, commissions, and other city offices. Information is also available on the General Business Tax, the Mayor's Tax Committee, the Mayor's Scholarship Program of 1979‚Äì1980, cable TV, Century IV celebration, CETA, the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, energy, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers Strike of 1981, the Educational Nomination Panel of 1981‚Äì1982, Mayor's and Cabinet members' schedules for 1980‚Äì1982, Conversation Hall renovations that were started by Green, council legislation, Freedom Festival, among many other topics.These records can be found in the City Archives, 3101 Market Street, Philadelphia PA 19104. Post-mayoral career After his term as Mayor expired, Green practiced law, opened two restaurants in the emerging Manayunk section of Philadelphia, and passed up opportunities to run for the U.S. Senate in 1986 and 1991. He established himself as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist and purchased a home in suburban Virginia. In the late 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s, Green pursued a successful career as vice president of government relations for MacAndrews & Forbes, a large holding company that includes Revlon. In 2003, Green retired from MacAndrews & Forbes and returned with his wife to Philadelphia, where he has since kept a low political profile. Some of his associates while he was mayor have dominated Republican mayoral politics in the decades since he has left office, but none has won election in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. His son, William J. \\"Bill\\" Green, IV, was elected to Philadelphia City Council in 2007.

Its archaeology documents much of the history of southern England. Pre-Roman Maiden Castle is one of the largest hill forts in Europe. Photograph taken in 1935 by Major George Allen (1891‚Äì1940). The first known settlement of Dorset was by Mesolithic hunters, who returned to Britain at a time when it was still attached to Europe by a land-bridge, around 12,500 BC. The population was very small, maybe only a few thousand across the whole of Britain, and concentrated along the coast: in Dorset, such places as the Isle of Purbeck, Weymouth, Chesil Beach and Hengistbury Head, and along the Stour valley. These populations used stone tools and fire to clear some of the native oak forest for herding prey. Genetic experiments carried out on a Mesolithic skeleton from Cheddar Gorge (in the neighbouring county of Somerset) have shown that a significant part of the contemporary population of Dorset is descended from these original inhabitants of the British Isles.\\"Cheddar Man is my long-lost relative\\", By Sean O'Neill. http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/a1/stoppress/stop12.htm \\"A History of Ancient Britain Episode I: Age of Ice\\", presented by Neil Oliver for the BBC This suggests that when a wave of immigrant farmers arrived from the continent in the Neolithic, the indigenous hunter-gatherers were not wiped out, but instead most likely adopted agricultural practices. Further woodland clearances took place at this stage, and also in the Bronze Age, to make way for agriculture and animal husbandry, although where the soils were poor and made permanent cultivation difficult, clearance led instead to the creation of heathland. Neolithic and Bronze Age burial mounds are particularly numerous throughout much of the county. Dorset's high chalk hills have provided a location for defensive settlements for millennia, with a large number of late Bronze Age but mostly Iron Age hill forts, such as Maiden Castle, Hod Hill, Badbury Rings and Hambledon Hill. The chalk downs were largely deforested during these times, making way for field and pasture. Some of the steeper slopes and hill tops are inaccessible or impractical for arable farming, and there the archaeology is relatively well preserved; the valley floors and broader hills have usually been ploughed, and hence do not have a good record of pre-Roman archaeology, although this does not mean that Iron Age peoples didn't settle there. Indeed, many contemporary theories postulate that hillforts may not have been the main focus of settlement, but served more as a marketplace-cum-stronghold in times of danger, and in fact most of the time, the population was concentrated in the valleys. By the Late Iron Age, the inhabitants of Dorset were minting their own coinage and thriving on trade with Northern Gaul (Armorica, now known as Brittany). However, after Armorica was conquered by Julius Caesar in 56 BC, the trade dried up; the Romans re- arranged trade with Britain to the profit of their allies, the Trinovantes, in Essex. The next century or so until the Roman conquest saw a long drawn-out period of economic retrenchment in Dorset, in parallel with a rising population and a decline in soil quality (much of it had been in cultivation for 4,000 years). By the time of the Roman Conquest, it is likely that a combination of overpopulation and impoverishment of the soil left many people starving, to which bone analysis of skeletons from Bere Regis bears witness; several of the skeletons present ample evidence of numerous distinct episodes of severe malnourishment during childhood.Digging for Britain, presented by Dr Alice Roberts for the BBC; 9 September 2011 The Romans record the name of the native British tribe that lived in Dorset as the Durotriges, who were also the tribe of much of Somerset and possibly the New Forest. Sometimes translated as \\"water dwellers\\", this name could mean that they were seafarers, but is more likely a reference to the marshy valley of the River Frome which they would have farmed. However, this etymology is unsound, based on the Welsh word dwr meaning water; however the earlier form of the word was dwfr, which suggests an Ancient British ancestor-word *dubro-, not *duro- (this form of the word is preserved in the place-name Dover). Another alternative is \\"fort-dwellers\\"; it is known that the Durotriges were still occupying their hillforts at the time of the Roman invasion in 43 AD, whereas in most other parts of Britain they had been abandoned around 100 BC. There is also a Cornish word dur meaning \\"land\\" or \\"earth\\"; hence the Durotriges might also be \\"land-dwellers\\", referring to their already important farming tradition: it is known that they were exporting grain to the Roman Empire in large quantities already by the first century BC. The etymology of the first element is thus far from certain, although the second element definitely means \\"dwellers\\" (Cornish tre, \\"town\\", tregez \\"have lived\\"; Welsh tref \\"town\\"). \\"Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC Until the Roman Conquest\\", by Barry Cunliffe, 2005\\"Britain BC\\", by Francis Pryor, 2000 Roman The Romans landed in Dorset at Poole Harbour and the Fleet and moved inland, while other groups travelled west from Old Sarum and Winchester. At Abbotsbury on the Fleet the Romans quickly took the hill fort, Abbotsbury Castle, bloodlessly before moving on to Maiden Castle. There is some evidence of a struggle at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings but current opinion amongst archaeologists is that these, and Hod Hill, also fell with ease. There is, however, a find of 130 skeletons at Spetisbury which show that the invasion was not entirely peaceful. Dorset has many notable Roman artefacts,Archaeological finds are conserved in the Dorset County Museum, Dorchester particularly around the Roman town Dorchester, where Maiden Castle was taken early in the Roman occupation. In the grounds of the County Council offices is a Roman house with well preserved mosaic floors and an aqueduct fed by waters of a tributary of the Frome impounded behind an earthen dam, with a covered timber-lined channel of some nine km; the dam gave way and the aqueduct was abandoned unexpectedly early, in the mid-2nd century.Bill Putnam, \\"The Roman Aqueduct at Dorchester, Dorset\\" Roman roads radiated from Dorchester, following the tops of the chalk ridges north west to Ilchester near Yeovil, and east to Badbury Rings where it forked to Winchester, Bath and a particularly well-preserved route running north east to Old Sarum near Salisbury, as well as tracks to the many small Roman villages around the county. In the Roman era settlements moved from the hill tops to the valleys, with Roman finds, such as the famous Hinton St Mary mosaic, being found in the vales. In the Isle of Purbeck a long-settled Iron Age site at Worth Matravers was reorganised late in the Roman period to grow grain for the legion, with a grain-parching granary floor heated with a hypocaust. By the 4th century the hilltops had been abandoned. Post Roman In the post Roman period from about 400 AD to 650 AD, the future Dorset was an independent British kingdom. Although there were Jutish and later Saxon people in the Southampton area from the 5th century, the Britons seem to have successfully resisted their expansion into future Dorset for a long period. One of the key battles (Mount Badon) between the Britons and Saxons may have been fought at Badbury Rings, though this is disputed. The only historical record of the period, Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, may have been written in Dorset . There may have been a Saxon raid at Bindon in 614, though the location is not certain. There is a group of Romano-British inscriptions at Wareham. Saxon A large defensive ditch on Cranborne Chase in the north east of the county, Bokerley Dyke, dated to 367, delayed the Saxon conquest of Dorset, with the Romano- British remaining in Dorset for 200 years after the withdrawal of the Roman legions. The inhospitable coastline prevented an invasion from the sea. When the Roman road across Cranborne Chase was rebuilt in the 6th century the Saxons advanced into Dorset. The Romano-British retreated, constructing another defence, Combs Ditch, which also fell within a century. It is thought that the Saxons captured east Dorset in the mid-7th century and west Dorset shortly afterwards, but the details are not known.Draper (p142) Dorset was initially part of Saxon Wessex, with the first record of Dorset being in 841. Coenred, the sub-king of Dorset at the end of the 7th century, was father of King Ine. St Martin's church at Wareham is reputedly the oldest in Dorset but there were many other Saxon foundations including Shaftesbury Abbey and Sherborne Monastery. King Ethelred I (866-871) is buried at Wimborne, while St Cuthberga, abbess of Wimborne, died in 725. Gillingham is first mentioned in a 10th-century charter. Aldhelm was the first bishop of the Diocese of Sherborne, created in 705 AD. This covered the part of Wessex \\"west of Selwood\\". In 876 King Alfred the Great trapped a Danish fleet at Arne then drove it out, 120 ships being wrecked at Studland. Corfe Castle in 978 saw the murder of King Edward the Martyr, whose body was taken first to Wareham and then to Shaftesbury. Middle Ages During the Middle Ages monasteries like Sherborne Abbey were the biggest power in Dorset The Domesday Book documents many Saxon settlements corresponding to modern towns and villages, mostly in the valleys, and there have been few changes to the parishes since.Cullingford (p.41-43) Over the next few centuries the settlers established the pattern of farmland which prevailed into the nineteenth century.Cullingford (p.16)Cullingford (p.47) Many monasteries were also established, which were important landowners and centres of power.Cullingford (p.46-47) A number of military events took place in Dorset during The Anarchy of the 12th century, and this gave rise to the defensive castles at Corfe Castle, Powerstock, Wareham and Shaftesbury. In 1348 the Black Death came to England, probably landing in ports along the south coast, including Melcombe Regis now part of Weymouth. The then busy port was one of the first towns to experience the epidemic which went on to wipe out a third of the population of the country.Hilliam (p17) In the 14th and 15th centuries the hilltop villages shrank further, and many disappeared altogether. Throughout the Medieval period, Dorset was popular amongst the nobility, including a number of kings, for its hunting estates, such as Gillingham and Sherborne. A number of deer parks still remain in the county.Cullingford (p.86) The 12th and 13th centuries saw much prosperity in Dorset and the population grew substantially as a result.Cullingford (p48) In order to provide the extra food required, additional land was enclosed for farming during this time. The quarrying of Purbeck Marble, a limestone that can be polished, brought wealth into the county and provided employment for stonecutters and masons. Large amounts of the stone were used in the construction of Salisbury Cathedral. The trade continues today but has declined since the 15th century when alabaster from Derbyshire became popular.Cullingford (p49) Another mediaeval industry, which continues today, was the manufacture of rope. Bridport was particularly famous for its rope, so much so that the phrase 'stabbed with the Bridport dagger' was commonly used to describe someone who had died at the hands of the hangman. Bridport rope was also purchased in large quantities by the Royal Navy. In the 15th century, Henry VII decreed that all hemp within a 5-mile radius of the town was to be reserved for the navy.Hilliam (p86) Early Modern Royalist stronghold Corfe Castle was destroyed in the English Civil War From the Tudor to Georgian periods farming specialised and the monastic estates broke up, leading to an increase in population and settlement size. The Dissolution of the Monasteries closed the abbeys at Sherborne, Shaftesbury, Milton Abbas, Abbotsbury and Cerne Abbas, though both Sherborne and Milton abbeys were saved from destruction. In 1588, eight ships from Dorset assisted in the destruction of the Spanish Armada.Cullingford (p58) The flagship San Salvador still lies at the bottom of Studland bay. Sir Walter Raleigh later settled in Sherborne and served as MP for Dorset.Cullingford (p59) In the 17th-century English Civil War Dorset had a number of royalist strongholds, such as Sherborne Castle and Corfe Castle, which were ruined in the war. Corfe had already been successfully defended against an attack in 1643 but an act of betrayal during a second siege in 1646 led to its capture and subsequent slighting. The residents of Lyme Regis were staunch Parliamentarians who, in 1644, repelled three attacks by a Royalist army under King Charle's nephew, Prince Maurice. Maurice lost 2,000 men in the assaults and his reputation was severely damaged as a result.Hillman (pp 143-144) The largest civil war battle in Dorset was not fought between Cavaliers and Roundheads however. The Dorset clubmen, a group of angry civilians who were annoyed by the disruption caused by the war, had no allegiance to either side. In 1645 some 5,000 of them gathered at Shaftesbury to do battle with Parliamentarian troops. Armed only with clubs and a variety of farming implements, they were easily dispersed. A smaller force of 2,000 or so regrouped on Hambledon Hill and were again routed. Many were taken prisoner and this was effectively the end for the organisation. In 1685, James Scott Monmouth, the illegitimate son of Charles II, and 150 supporters landed at Lyme Regis. After the failed Monmouth Rebellion, the 'Bloody Assizes' took place in Dorchester where over a five-day period, Judge Jeffreys presided over 312 cases. 74 were executed; 29 were hanged, drawn and quartered; 175 were deported and many were publicly whipped.Cullingford (p71) In 1686, at Charborough Park, a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England. This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution.Cullingford (p72) During the 18th century the Dorset coast saw much smuggling activity; its coves, caves and sandy beaches provided ample opportunities to slip smuggled goods ashore.Cullingford (pp.87-88) In 1747 a notorious gang of armed smugglers broke into the customs house in Poole to reclaim their captured contraband.Cullingford (p88) The production of cloth was a profitable business in Dorset during the 17th and 18th centuries.Cullingford (p.91) Blandford became famous for its bonelace and Stalbridge for its stockings. Shaftsbury, Sturminster Marshall, Beamister, Burton Bradstock, Gillingham, Cerne Abbas and Winterbourne Stickland produced a wide variety of materials between them, including sailcloth, linen and even silk. The absence of coal however meant that during the Industrial Revolution Dorset was unable to compete with the large mechanised mills of Lancashire and so remained largely rural.Cullingford (pp.91-92)Draper (p143) The Tolpuddle Martyrs lived in Dorset, and the farming economy of Dorset was central in the formation of the trade union movement.Cullingford (pp.114-116) Modern Portland Harbour was an important Royal Navy base in the First and Second World Wars The industrial revolution largely by-passed Dorset, which has remained largely rural. The farming economy, however, provided the spark for the Trade Union movement when, in the 1820s a group of farm labourers formed one of the first unions. In 1832 unions were outlawed and the six men, now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were transported, becoming national heroes to the working classes. In the 19th century the railways bought increased mobility and communications to the British people. Lines through Dorset include the South Western Main Line, from London to Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and Weymouth; the Heart of Wessex Line from Bristol to Sherborne, Dorchester and Weymouth; the West of England Main Line from London to Exeter, with stations at Sherborne and Gillingham; and the now dismantled Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway from Bath to Bournemouth. There were also a number of small branchlines, closed in the Beeching axe, such as those to Bridport and Swanage. The Swanage Railway has been reopened as a heritage railway. During World War I and II Dorset, located on the English Channel, was both a target and important to the Royal Navy. The large Portland Harbour, built at the end of the 19th century and protected by Nothe Fort and the Verne Citadel, was for many years, including during the wars, one of the largest Royal Navy bases. British, American and Canadian ships gathered in the harbour and nearby in Weymouth bay before the D-Day landings. Training for the landings also took place in Dorset, at the long sandy beach at Studland. Portland Harbour continued to be used as a Royal Navy and NATO training base until the 1990s. It is now a civilian port and recreation area which will be used for the sailing events in the 2012 Olympic Games. Since the early 19th century, when George III took holidays in Weymouth while ill, Dorset's tourism industry has grown, with the seaside resorts of Bournemouth and Weymouth, the Jurassic Coast and the county's sparsely populated rural areas attracting millions of visitors each year. With farming declining across the country tourism now rivals agriculture as the main economy of the county. In 1974 the political boundaries of Dorset were modified, incorporating a small area of south west Hampshire which included the towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. In 1996 Bournemouth and Poole became administratively independent from the county. See also * History of England References Bibliography *Arkell, W.J., 1978.

The series was written by Dave Spikey, who played the part of Jerry St Clair in Phoenix Nights. It was produced for ITV by the Red Production Company, and starred Spikey and Johnny Vegas. The series concerns the staff of a fictional newspaper, The Fogburrow Advertiser, and the title of the series is a typical example of the paper's front-page headlines; Spikey saw the headline on a newspaper billboard about a man who had died but was resuscitated and then later married. The billboard did not have quote marks around the word dead, which made Spikey laugh and so he developed the sitcom from that headline. In the series, a new editor, Gordon Garden (played by Spikey), is determined to shake up the newspaper. The acting editor, Lewis Donat (played by Vegas), is convinced that he should have been made editor himself, and believes that journalism involves going on a break as soon as he gets in, stealing stories from old newspapers and getting the rest of the news from Joan at the cake shop, Cake That. The series was filmed in several locations, notably Castleton in Derbyshire. The theme music, also used as incidental music and stings throughout the series, is a version of Jonathan King's composition \\"It's Good News Week\\", which was a hit for Hedgehoppers Anonymous in 1965. The production company has announced that the series will not be released on DVD because of problems obtaining copyright clearance for the music used.

Founded in 1859 along the banks of the North Platte River as a trading post and toll bridge on the Oregon Trail, the post was later taken over by the Army and named Platte Bridge Station to protect emigrants and the telegraph line against raids from Lakota and Cheyenne in the ongoing wars between those nations and the United States. The site of the fort, near the intersection of 13th Street and Wyoming Boulevard in Casper, Wyoming, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is now owned and operated by the City of Casper as the Fort Caspar Museum and Historic Site. History The area where Platte Bridge Station was located had been the site of various temporary Army encampments over a period of years before the establishment of the fort, or \\"station\\" itself. The fort was located on the south side of the North Platte, near the western edge of present-day Casper, at one several local points where the Emigrant Trail crossed from the south side to the north side of the river. In 1847, during the first Mormon wagon train to present-day Utah, Brigham Young commissioned a ferry at the site for later emigrants. The ferry consisted of cottonwood dugout canoes and planking for a deck, with two oars and a rudder. On June 19, Young named nine men to remain to operate the ferry while the remainder of the party continued the journey westward. A group of Mormons returned to the site each summer between 1847 and 1852 to operate the ferry. The ferry was moved to a different spot on the North Platte in North Casper in 1849. It was eventually replaced with a rope-and-pulley system that could make the crossing in five minutes. In following years, trader John Baptiste Richard established a trading post several miles downriver of the crossing. The U.S. Army established its first presence in the area in 1855, erecting Fort Clay near Richard's trading post. In 1859, when the site was part of the Nebraska Territory, Louis Guinard built a competing bridge at the trading post, called the Platte Bridge Station, at the site of the old Mormon Ferry crossing. From 1860‚Äì1861, the Pony Express operated a station at the site. By the middle 1860s, the increasing presence of emigrants and other white settlers in the region began to cause friction with the Lakota and Cheyenne. In response, and partly to protect the new telegraph line, the Army began increasing its presence in the region in 1861 by sending a detachment to guard Guinard's bridge. Many of these troops, who created a series of \\"stations\\" along the Oregon trail, were from various state units raised during the Civil War. In 1862 the Army used the buildings at Platte Bridge station while building and occupying Ft. Caspar. Guinard, a naturalized U.S. citizen, born in Quebec around 1820 or 1821 had hired his nephew of the same name - Louis P. Guinard, also born in Quebec in 1840 - to come and help build this bridge. Louis P. came and worked for his uncle about three years, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1863. He worked on the actual building of the bridge as well as keeping his uncle's financial records. Louis Guinard the uncle, fell from the bridge on June 6, 1865 and drowned, leaving the property to his nephew Louis P. Guinard, who took possession on July 15 of 1865. The will was discovered in 1866 and Louis P Guinard stated that he was advised by Major Bullock, sutler at Ft. Laramie, that the will left him as sole owner of the property and that he should remain and hold possession of it. The U.S. troops occupied Guinard's buildings for three years during the Civil War. Louis P. Guinard stated that one of the officers promised him $1000 for use of the said buildings but he never received any payment. The bridge was later destroyed by Indians when the troops left in 1865, and with hundreds of Indians appearing on the opposite bank of the river, Guinard felt he had no choice but to leave for the protection of himself and his family. They had gone no more than 4 or 5 miles before he could tell from the smoke columns that the Indians were burning everything. Guinard had left his will in the safekeeping of Major Bullock at Ft. Laramie, having no way at the time to get it probated or secured in a bank. He later filed claim to be compensated for Indian depredations but Major Bullock told him the will was lost or destroyed. Unable to produce the will, the case dragged on in the courts for more than 25 years before it was finally abandoned and Guinard was never compensated for his losses.Claim of Louis Guinard Vs the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians, No. 7806 and No. 1319 Battle of the Platte Bridge Station Reconstructed Platte Bridge In July 1865, accompanied by survivors of the Sand Creek Massacre which occurred the previous November as part of the Colorado War, a party of several thousand Cheyenne and Sioux approached Platte Bridge Station from the north intending to attack the soldiers camped there and destroy the bridge. They had previously scouted the area and selected it because the soldiers there were not in the small trading post stockade of 14-foot pine logs but camped in tents. Initially only a small party of Indians showed themselves to the troops, the remainder of the Indians remaining concealed.Hyde (1968), pp. 212-222 By the afternoon of July 25, however, when a large raiding party had driven off a number of horses and forced the pursuing cavalry troopers to expend much ammunition, the station had permanent structures and a mountain howitzer of the 11th Ohio Cavalry covered the approaches to the bridge.Brown (1963), p. 36 Late that night a detachment of 14 men of Company I, 3rd U.S. Volunteer Infantry led by Capt. Adam Smith Leib, escorted by 1st Lt. Henry C. Bretney and six (some accounts say 10) troopers of Company G, 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, arrived from Sweetwater Station en route to Fort Laramie for supplies and a long-overdue payroll. They found the station on 50% guard duty and molding bullets. Leib advised the station commander, Major Martin Anderson of the 11th Kansas Cavalry, that he had earlier passed a small train of five empty mule-drawn wagons returning from Sweetwater to Laramie, 14 teamsters escorted by 11 enlisted men of the 11th Kansas. Knowing that the train was due to come in the next morning, the officers at the post discussed sending out a relief force to drive off the Cheyenne and Lakota warriors, so that the wagon train could come safely in. Leib and Bretney suggested an immediate march but Anderson decided to wait for daylight.Brown (1963), pp. 35-36 Bretney, who had succeeded to command of Company G on February 13 when its captain, Levi M. Rinehart, had been accidentally killed by a drunken trooper during a skirmish, was not on good terms with Anderson. On his arrival at Platte Bridge on July 16, the Kansan had replaced Bretney as post commander and ordered Company G to relocate to Sweetwater Station, escorting the same wagon train now returning from there. In addition, the 11th Kansas Cavalry was due to march to Fort Kearney on or about August 1 to muster out of service. After reveille, all four of Anderson's officers declined to lead the relief force and some placed themselves on the sick list to avoid the duty. 20-year- old 2nd Lt. Caspar W. Collins of Company G 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, en route back to his company farther west from a remount detail at Fort Laramie, had arrived the afternoon before with the mail ambulance and was ordered by Anderson to lead the relief. Bretney had no authority to countermand the order but advised Collins to refuse it. Instead Collins borrowed Bretney's pistols and was given a mount from the regimental band.Brown (1963), p. 37 Among those leading the Indian warriors were Red Cloud and the famed warrior Roman Nose. George Bent, the half Cheyenne son of William Bent who survived the Sand Creek Massacre, participated in the battle as a Cheyenne warrior, and later wrote about it in his letters.Hyde (1968), p. 216 At dawn numerous Indians were observed by sentinels on the surrounding hills observing the station. At 7:00 a.m. a larger force forded the river east of the station and rode just out of rifle range, taunting the garrison. Collins and a small detachment of 25 men of the 11th Kansas crossed the Platte Bridge at a walk, then formed into a column of fours and rode west along the north bank at a trot to drive off any hostile Indians. Behind him, the contingent of the 3rd U.S.V.I. and its 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry escort crossed the bridge on foot as a support force for Collins, forming a skirmish line when they observed several hundred Cheyenne emerge from the sand hills and gulleys between themselves and Collins.Brown (1963), pp. 36-38 The Indians had concealed large bands of warriors near the bridge and over the crest of the hills, possibly as many as a thousand Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho. Collins wheeled his detachment into two lines and charged the first group to emerge, only to find himself heavily outnumbered. He then ordered a retreat to the bridge through the Cheyenne to his rear as yet another force, this of Lakota, attempted to rush the bridge. The skirmish line at the bridge held the Lakota at bay with volley fire until 20 of the 26 troopers, all wounded to some extent, fought their way through. Five were killed, including Collins, who was wounded in the hip and shot in the forehead with an arrow while trying to aid a wounded soldier.Utley (1967), p. 320Brown (1963), p. 38 The battle lasted only a few minutes, with Bent claiming that the Lakota and Cheyenne suffered only a few casualties. Bretney in a rage returned to the stockade and accused the Kansas officers of cowardice when Anderson refused to allow a larger force and the howitzer to attempt another relief. Anderson placed Bretney under arrest and turned over the post's defenses to Leib, who had the garrison throw up an embrasure and dig rifle pits to protect the howitzer at the south end of the bridge. During the morning the attacking force destroyed a thousand feet of telegraph wire on the line to Fort Laramie before Anderson thought to request reinforcements, then drove off the detail sent to repair it, killing another trooper.Brown (1963), pp. 39-40 The wagon train, commanded by Sergeant Amos J. Custard, was attacked approximately five miles to the west, within sight of the station, at around 11:00 a.m.Brown (1963), p. 40 According to the Indians the battle lasted about half an hour with one person escaping, a teamster, 22 troopers killed along with 8 Indian warriors. Many Indian warriors were wounded. The Indians, as was their custom, took no prisoners.Hyde (1968), pp.220-222 However Army accounts state that the wagons were forced into a hollow where they held out for four hours, using fire from Spencer rifles to repel assaults until a large group closed on foot and overwhelmed the defenders, killing all. The wagons were burned at approximately 3:00 p.m. Corporal James A. Shrader and four troopers, sent as scouts by Custard to investigate the sound of the howitzer firing, were cut off and pursued by a hundred Cheyenne led by the brother of Roman Nose, Left Hand, who was killed in the running fight. Eventually Shrader and two men made their way on foot into the station. Two Shoshone scouts were paid to take a message requesting reinforcements to the next telegraph station east, but the attacking force broke up before relief arrived.Brown (1963), pp. 40-41 The battle became known as the Battle of Platte Bridge Station. The battle of the wagon train also became known as the Battle of Red Buttes, although that location was ten miles further to the west. Army fatalities in both actions numbered 27 men of the 11th Kansas Cavalry and Lt. Collins, with at least ten seriously wounded. Historian Robert Utley placed combined Indian casualties in all the July forays around Platte Bridge Station as 60 killed and 130 wounded.Utley (1967), p. 322 The Army officially renamed the post Fort Caspar to honor Collins, using his given name to differentiate the post from an existing fort in Colorado named after Collins' father. Abandonment The fort was abandoned two years later in August 1867, with the garrison moved to Fort Fetterman at Douglas, Wyoming. Restoration and Museum Fort Caspar was partially reconstructed in 1936 using sketches made by Lieutenant Collins in 1863. The fort itself underwent a lot of changes during its occupation, and the current recreation reflects the post in 1863-1865. The City of Casper now operates a museum at the site, which features reconstructed log buildings, including a wooden stockade. The site also includes a replica of the Mormon ferry that was operated there between 1847 and 1849, as well as a model of part of the bridge that later replaced the ferry. In early December members of a living history group portraying a company of the 3rd US Infantry host a historical reenactment at the site.

It is to the advantage of an organization to employ versatilists‚Äîbecause an enterprise will be able to easily redeploy this type of employee based on changes in business requirements or strategy. To illustrate this using a mathematical concept, the versitilist has a higher area under the curve rating. Think of a person having some level of knowledge/experience in 15 knowledge areas. That person may have a very high competency (score 5) in 3 areas, a medium level of competency (score 3) in 5 areas an introductory level of competency (score 1) in 4 areas and no competency (score 0) in 3 areas. This creates an area under the curve of 34. This is different from a specialist who may score very high in one area and have no competency in others. This is also different from a generalist who may score a 1 or 3 in every area. This breadth of knowledge and experience is what enables faster changes to other roles.

She was named for William B. Renshaw. History Renshaw was laid down 8 May 1918 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; launched 21 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Frank Johnson; and commissioned 31 July 1919, LCDR R. A. Hall in command. Renshaw was assigned to the Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. She joined the Fleet in Monterey Bay, and passed in review for the Secretary of the Navy who observed the Fleet from . Renshaw departed San Francisco 16 September for her base of operations, San Diego, where she arrived on the 20th. Her brief service was none too active, since small appropriations limited most units of the Fleet to routine target practice and engineering competition. The destroyer participated in exercises off the California coast, performed patrol and dispatch duty, transported prisoners, and made one training cruise with naval reservists out of Portland, Oregon. Renshaw cruised to Hawaii from 25 March to 28 April 1920, with Destroyer Flotilla 11, to conduct a thorough reconnaissance of the islands with a view toward establishing an operating base for the Fleet. During the period from 16 December 1920 to 4 April 1921, the ship was at the Puget Sound Navy Yard for overhaul, returning to base on 8 April to rejoin the Destroyer Force. In January 1922 Renshaw calibrated radio compasses for the 12th Naval District. She returned to San Diego 28 January and remained moored, except for a brief trip to San Pedro 20‚Äì24 February, until decommissioned 27 May 1922. The destroyer was laid up at San Diego until disposed of in 1936 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament. She was struck from the Navy list 19 May 1936, sold 29 September to Schiavone Bonomo Corporation, and reduced to a hulk 2 December 1936.

It is the second book published and third chronologically in the Redwall series.  Plot summary  US cover of Mossflower The story begins in the Mossflower Wood, where a community of animals suffers under the tyranny of a ruling wildcat named Verdauga. When a mouse from the north, Martin the Warrior, comes to Mossflower Woods, he is captured and brought to the castle Kotir, where his sword is broken by Verdauga's daughter, Tsarmina, and he is imprisoned within the Kotir dungeons. Meanwhile, Tsarmina poisons Verdauga with the help of the vixen Fortunata and blames it on her brother Gingivere. She places her brother in prison and takes the throne for herself. While in the dungeons, Martin eventually meets Gonff the Mousethief, who was imprisoned for stealing food from the Kotir storages. Meanwhile, Abbess Germaine and the surviving members of Loamhedge, an abbey stricken with a plague, arrive and join the woodlanders. Martin and Gonff escape with help from the Corim (Council Of Resistance In Mossflower) and join with Young Dinny the mole on a quest to find Boar the Fighter, Badger Lord of Salamandastron. Bella, Boar's daughter, believed only her father could defeat Tsarmina and put an end to her cruel reign. The crew sets out on the quest to find Boar. They are pursued by Splitnose the stoat, Blacktooth the ferret, and their leader, Scratch the weasel. The trio eventually dies- Scratch by a swan, and Splitnose and Blacktooth in a duel. The crew eventually comes to a river with a ferry, where they meet a snake and a newt. They threaten to kill the travellers. Then, a shrew emerges and scares away the duo into the river, revealing the snake is a grass snake. The shrew introduces himself as Log-a-log Big Club, a former village leader, escaped oar slave and current ferryman. He joins the group on its quest. They sail on his boat, Waterwing to the mountains. The ship is broken in a waterfall. When Martin comes to, he is in a huge mountain ruled by bats, called Bat Mountpit. After Martin, Dinny and Log-a-log (Gonff is missing) help scare away the tawny owl that nests on the rooftop, they leave. They get ambushed by toads, and get thrown into the \\"Screamhole\\", where they reunite with Gonff. They meet the Snakefish, the massive eel who is trapped in the hole, and formulate a plan to escape. They eventually escape with the help of the Snakefish. The Snakefish wreakes havoc among the toads, who had captured it before. The group reaches the beach. They trek through the sand, attacked by birds. After a while, they come to a tide pool and meet a crab. The crab attacks them. It grabs one of the staves the group used. However, it couldn't let go, and acted strangely. Gonff ended up doing a dance with it. Deprived from food and water, they witness gulls kill a rat. They stay at the rat's hut, and continue the next day, with Salamandastron very near. The companions reach Salamandastron with the help of a few hares, and meet with Boar the Fighter. Boar introduces them to the hares that live in the mountain, and then reforges Martin's broken sword with metal from a meteorite, but is killed while fighting his mortal enemy Ripfang the searat who had attacked Salamandastron several times before. Ripfang's former oarslaves (including Martin's childhood friend Timballisto) and several members of Log a Log's former tribe take over the sea rat ship, Bloodwake, with help from Martin and his allies. They return to Mossflower Woods, where Martin kills Tsarmina and destroys Kotir by both flooding it and knocking over its walls with a ballista. In the final battle with Tsarmina, Martin is left near death. With the help of the woodlanders, he eventually recovers, but his memory is never the same thereafter, as evidenced in The Legend of Luke. The book ends with Bella's son, Sunflash, finding Salamandastron and becoming its ruler.

Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, p. 45 Construction and career O'Bannon, named for Presley O'Bannon, was laid down by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 November 1918, launched 28 February 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Henry O'Bannon Cooper descendant by marriage of Lt.

O'Bannon sailed out of San Diego for exercises and training maneuvers along the coast of California and in Hawaiian waters throughout her career. In the spring of 1920 she conducted experiments with torpedoes, and then was in reserve commission from June to November, when she resumed her training schedule. She decommissioned at San Diego 27 May 1922, was struck from the Navy List 19 May 1936, and was sold 29 September 1936. See also *See USS O'Bannon for other ships of this name.

A vol (French for \\"flight\\") is a once-obscure heraldic symbol consisting of a pair of outstretched, usually plumed bird's wings, which are connected together at their shoulders without having any bird's body in the middle. The French Arm√©e de l'Air, one of the world's first air forces, adopted a vol for its cap badge, rather than the eagle used by many other air forces. In France, the eagle is associated with the Napoleonic empire. Cap badges Many European countries have an eagle as the main charge of the heraldic shields of their respective monarchies: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and pre-revolutionary Russia all used some derivative of this bird in their badge. Poland did too, and even kept its badge under Communist rule, because Poland did not have a king since the partition of Poland late in the eighteenth century, so the symbol was merely nominal. In America, the cap badge of the US Air Force is the Great Seal of the United States, which also includes an eagle. But its use for the US Air Force derives from that service's derivation from the US Army, which also had the same badge. Another source for putting an eagle on the cap badge is that it stands for royalty in general. Thus the Royal Air Force includes a complete eagle, even though the coat of arms of the United Kingdom does not. The air forces of various Arab countries do as well. And the air force of Egypt, although not a monarchy, uses \\"Saladin's Eagle\\" as well; formerly, they used a hawk. During the Second World War, the air forces of Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, and Yugoslavia also used a bird of prey as their cap badge. Over a decade after the Second World War, Japan formed the Air Self-Defense Force. This too had a bird other than an eagle as an emblem: a bird-of-prey called a kite, referring to a battle during which a kite was seen in a tree against the rising sun. Other countries use the vol as their main emblem. Israel Air Force is notable in that its emblem, not being a complete bird, avoids idolatry. The countries of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War generally rejected the use of the eagle in the list of state seals above. For example, the Soviet air force used a vol very similar to the French, but supporting a conventional, five-pointed star, so as to distinguish themselves from having anything to do with Imperial Russia. Hungary had nearly the same symbol, while Romania had a different one. The Deutsche Luftstreitkr√§fte, or East German Air Force, used a particularly modernistic vol as its cap badge. This had extra significance, because the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany used an eagle carrying a swastika. Currently, the Russians have returned to their heraldic past, while the Germans use a symbol different from that of the Luftwaffe. Insignia of branch of service Air services which are not independent from their country's armies have used a vol as the insignia of their branch of service. The US Army Air Forces, during the Second World War, used a winged, two-bladed propeller on the lapels of their tunics. The same sort of insigne was used by the Soviets before they had an independent air force. Warsaw Pact armed forces often had a red, five-pointed star superimposed upon the juncture point of this symbol. Pilot's insigne It is as the symbol of \\"wings\\" given to trained aircraft operators for which the vol is primarily used. All of the pilot's badges of the USAF, as well as the various Naval Aviator's badges of the USN, employ vols with a shield standing for Congress in the middle. These are of different design, and the USAF used silver while the USN uses gold, and has an anchor behind the shield. The US Army uses \\"wings\\" with an open parachute in the middle for paratroopers. During the Second World War, the uniforms of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, France, Nationalist China, and even the RAF used a form of the vol as their pilot's insigne. The air forces of Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia used an entire bird. The Japanese had quite a different emblem; its wings are recognisably those of an aircraft. Rank insigne For the Luftwaffe, a vol was used to replace the chevron on the sleeves of enlisted men's uniforms. And the Romanian Air Force before 1945 used a vol for the shoulder rank insignia for warrant officers. UBS investment bank currently operates shoulder rank insignia amongst its Volatility Trading Department. Collar tab insigne The uniforms of British Army officers have \\"gorget patches\\" of a color different from the rest of the uniform sewn on their lapels, and so did many arms of the German military. Specifically, the uniforms of both enlisted ranks and officers in the Deutsche Luftstreitkr√§fte (or East German Air Force) did too. These had embroidered symbols on them which were rather similar to the vols used for rank insignia. Heraldic Use 'Vol' is term used in both Anglophone and Francophone heraldries - as in the bearings of Ripstein, Canada. Both the terms 'vol' and 'demi vol' (half a vol, i.e. a single wing) have been turning up every so often in Scots heraldry since the late 17th century - Sir Thomas Brand's crest, 'a volle with the baton of his office [Knight Usher of the Green Rod] in pale', in the Scottish Public Register volume 1, page 123, and the crest of Richard Graham, Viscount of Prestoun, volume 1, page 84 Category:Heraldic charges Vol ","title":"Vol (heraldry)"},{"id":"1121374","text":"The Queen Elizabeth Range () is a rugged mountain range of the Transantarctic Mountains System, located in the Ross Dependency region of Antarctica.

Ectocarpene was the first isolated algal pheromone. It was isolated from algae Ectocarpus (order Ectocarpales) by M√ºller and col. in 1971.

She was the first ship named for Seaman Daniel Hogan. Hogan was launched by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 April 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Magnus A. Anderson, a sister of the Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane and commissioned 1 October 1919, Lieutenant Commander E. M. Williams in command. Service history After shakedown, Hogan arrived at San Diego on 21 November to join the Pacific Destroyer Force. From 23 November to 6 February 1920 she sailed in company with her division and engaged in fleet maneuvers, patrol duty, torpedo exercises and target practice along the California coast. On 25 March she departed for Hawaii, where she operated for the next month. The destroyer rejoined her squadron at San Diego in late April for five months of gunnery exercises and trial runs in that area. She returned to San Diego in early 1921 and engaged in important experimental torpedo practice and divisional operations until 9 December. During that time, in October, Hogan became the first US Navy ship to be refuelled while underway, towed astern by the oiler . For the remainder of her service Hogan assisted U.S. battleships in conducting torpedo firing exercises in the Pacific. She decommissioned at San Diego on 27 May 1922.  Conversion to minesweeper  Recommissioned 7 August 1940, Hogan underwent conversion to a high speed minesweeper at Mare Island and reclassified DMS-6. Her activity up to World War II consisted mainly of intensified minesweeper training and patrol duty in the Caribbean and along the Eastern Coast, World War II During the early months of the war, Hogan acted as a convoy escort in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic, protecting shipping from U-boat attack. The first major operation in which she took part was the invasion of North Africa in late 1942. For this important amphibious assault, mounted over an entire ocean, Hogan departed Norfolk 24 October and arrived with the Center Force off Fedhala for preliminary sweeps 7 November. As the landings began early next day, the minesweeper continued to patrol the vital transport area. Just after 05:00, she was sent to investigate strange running lights and came upon a French steamer and escort vessel. Hogan ordered both ships to reverse course, and when the order was not obeyed fired a burst of machine gun fire across the escort's bow. The ship, Victoria, replied with fire of her own and attempted to ram the minesweeper, but Hogan avoided her and with 20 mm fire forced her surrender. In the days that followed, the minesweeper continued to conduct antisubmarine patrol off Fedhala, searching for submarines that attacked the transports on 11 November. The ship entered Casablanca harbor on 18 November, the invasion a success, and after patrol duties sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 26 December. Hogan next returned to coastal convoy duties until November 1943. She sailed on 13 November from Norfolk to join the Pacific Fleet, transited the Panama Canal, arriving at Mare Island on 5 December. The minesweeper was needed for the first phase of the long island campaign toward Japan, the invasion of the Marshalls, and sailed for Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein on 16 January 1944. Hogan carried out anti-submarine patrol off Roi Island before departing on 4 February for Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on 27 February. After another period of convoy duty, Hogan arrived at Milne Bay on 7 April to prepare for the Hollandia operation. The attack group sailed on 18 April and arrived at Humboldt Bay four days later. Hogan and other minesweepers cleared enemy mines for Admiral Daniel Barbey's invasion force, after which the ship carried out shore bombardment and screening duties. She arrived at Cape Sudest with on 25 April. Hogan sailed from Eniwetok on 10 June to make preliminary sweeps of Saipan for the invasion to come. She remained off Saipan during the assault on 15 June, coming under enemy shore fire, and moved to Guam the next day. As the Japanese fleet moved toward the Marianas for a decisive naval battle, Hogan returned to Saipan to protect the transports. In the great carrier battle which followed 19‚Äì20 June, the American fleet won a stunning victory, crippling the Japanese naval air arm and securing the Marianas operation from interference. Hogan returned to the staging base at Eniwetok on 30 June, but returned to Guam on 12 July to carry out screening and minesweeping duties for the assault there. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 5 August 1944. Following a tour of escort duty in the Solomons, Hogan steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco for repairs, arriving on 5 October. As the recapture of the Philippines gained momentum, the ship steamed from San Francisco on 6 November and arrived at the Manus staging area on 4 December 1944. Moving to Leyte Gulf before Christmas, Hogan sortied with the Minesweeping and Hydrographic Group on 2 January 1945. Kamikaze attacks began soon afterward, and continued during the voyage to Lingayen Gulf. The minesweepers entered the invasion area on 2 January and began their sweeping operations. Four of the minesweepers were sunk or damaged, and Hogans gunners were busy with attacking aircraft. With the operation well underway, the ship arrived at Leyte Gulf on 16 January. After retiring to Tinian, Hogan sailed once more on 7 February to take part in the important assault on Iwo Jima. During this operation she swept mines, screened transports, and carried out shore bombardment before departing with a group of battleships and their escorts 7 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 13 April via Ulithi she continued to San Diego on 3 May 1945. Hogan underwent major repairs and reclassified AG-105 on 5 June 1945. The veteran ship was assigned as a target ship for bombing tests and was sunk off San Diego on 8 November 1945. Awards Hogan received six battle stars for World War II service. As of 2009, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

It is the step in grain preparation after reaping. Threshing does not remove the bran from the grain. Threshing may be done by beating the grain using a flail on a threshing floor. Another traditional method of threshing is to make donkeys or oxen walk in circles on the grain on a hard surface. A modern version of this in some areas is to spread the grain on the surface of a country road so the grain may be threshed by the wheels of passing vehicles.M. Partridge, Farm Tools through the Ages (1973) Hand threshing was laborious, with a bushel of wheat taking about an hour. In the late 18th century, before threshing was mechanized, about one-quarter of agricultural labor was devoted to it. Industrialization of threshing began in 1786 with the invention of the threshing machine by Scotsman Andrew Meikle. Today, in developed areas, it is now mostly done by machine, usually by a combine harvester, which harvests, threshes, and winnows the grain while it is still in the field. The cereal may be stored in a barn or silos. A threshing bee was traditionally a bee in which local people gathered together to pitch in and get the season's threshing done. Such bees were sometimes festivals or events within larger harvest festivals. Today the original purpose is largely obsolete, but the festival tradition lives on in some modern examples that commemorate the past and include flea markets, hog wrestling, and dances.http://www.dufurthreshingbee.org Gallery File:Threshing-with- flail-RSJ.jpg|Threshing with hand flails, Great Britain, c. 1750.

She was named for Charles W. Howard, who was killed in the American Civil War aboard . Howard was launched by Union Iron Works San Francisco, California on 26 April 1919, sponsored by Marion Filmer. The destroyer was commissioned on 29 January 1920 at Mare Island, with Commander B. M. Stewart in command. Service history Howard departed San Francisco on 1 March 1920 to join the Pacific Destroyer force at San Diego, California. After initial tactical maneuvers and gunnery training, she departed San Diego on 3 May for Topolobampo, Mexico. She rejoined her destroyer flotilla on 17 May to participate in intensive and prolonged operations in the San Diego area, including torpedo practice, patrol, battle practices, and exercises with submarines. Howard decommissioned on 27 May 1922. Classified DMS-7 Recommissioned 29 August 1940, Howard was converted to a minesweeper and reclassified DMS-7. She sailed from San Diego in mid-October, arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 October, and proceeded on 19 November for duty in the Caribbean Sea. She remained there until 17 May 1941 conducting minesweeping assignments and patrol duty enforcing the Neutrality Act. Howard returned to Norfolk on 19 May and participated in exercises along the Chesapeake Bay until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 plunged the United States into World War II. World War II Howard was underway on 8 December on escort duty, and in the months that followed, convoyed transports and tankers in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, keeping supply lanes open despite German U-boats. Plans called for an invasion of North Africa in 1942, a massive and hazardous amphibious operation projected across thousands of miles of ocean. In October, Howard joined Admiral Hewitt's Western Naval Task Force at Norfolk. She sailed on 24 October and screened the cruiser during the Atlantic crossing. As troops landed on 8 November she performed both minesweeping and screening duties. During the first phase of the Naval Battle of Casablanca that day, Howard screened Augusta as the cruiser engaged shore batteries and dueled with the . The destroyer then remained off Casablanca and Safi while the American soldiers consolidated their beachheads and moored with naval units at Casablanca on 16 November 1942. After performing anti-submarine patrol duties she returned to Norfolk on 29 December. During most of 1943, Howard plied the convoy lanes of the Atlantic and Caribbean protecting Allied ships from submarine and air attack. She steamed to the West Indies, Panama, Newfoundland, and Iceland on this duty, a key part of which was protecting the oil tankers vital to the conduct of the war. As the tempo of operations against Japan increased, Howard was transferred to the western Pacific theater, sailing from Norfolk on 21 November 1943, and arriving at San Diego on 7 December. After repairs and training, the ship sailed on 25 March, escorting ships to Pearl Harbor and Majuro. She screened a returning convoy to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 24 April, and there began preparations for the gigantic invasion of the Marianas. Joining Admiral Richmond Turner's amphibious task force, Howard sortied on 29 May and arrived off Saipan via Eniwetok on 13 June. The ship swept minefields during the day and conducted patrol and harassing fire by night until the landings on 15 June. Howard then was assigned to screen transports, and made two shuttle voyages to Eniwetok and back to the Marianas before returning to Pearl Harbor on 10 August 1944. Howards next operation was the invasion of the Philippines, slated for October on the island of Leyte. Following training in the Hawaiian Islands she arrived at Eniwetok on 24 September, and steamed to Leyte Gulf on 17 October. Once more she carried out minesweeping duties, clearing paths in Surigao Strait and Leyte Gulf, despite heavy weather. Her task completed, she departed on 24 October for Manus with the invasion underway and during the first phase of the battle for Leyte Gulf, which ended in a victory for the U.S. Navy. Training operations in the Admiralties occupied the ship for the next two months, but she sailed again from Manus on 23 December to take part in the next phase of the Philippines operation, the invasion of Luzon. She rendezvoused at Leyte Gulf on 30 December, and departed in convoy for Lingayen Gulf on 2 January 1945. During this voyage through the Philippines, the Japanese made kamikaze attacks, with Howard shooting one attacker down and assisting in destroying many others. The invasion force arrived on 6 January. The minesweepers began their work under almost constant air attack; and, by the time troops landed on 9 January three of Howards sister ships had been lost. The invasion was successful and the veteran minesweepers departed to arrive in Leyte Gulf on 15 January 1945 and Ulithi on 5 February. As the American advance moved ever closer to Japan, Howard sailed from Tinian on 13 February with the invasion force for Iwo Jima. Assuming her customary role in advance of the landings, she commenced exploratory sweeps off the island on 16 February, fighting off numerous air attacks. After the assault 19 February the ship acted as a screening ship, arriving at Saipan on 2 March. Following another period of screening duty off Iwo Jima later in March, Howard arrived at Pearl Harbor via Guam on 4 April 1945. Newer ships now took the 25-year-old ship's duty on the front lines. Reclassified AG-106 on 5 June 1945, she escorted submarines in Hawaiian waters and acted as plane guard for carrier operations before sailing for the United States on 2 October. Transiting the Panama Canal, Howard arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 2 November and decommissioned there on 30 November 1945. In 1946, Howard was sold to Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and scrapped. Awards Howard received six battle stars for World War II service. Namesake Charles W. Howard volunteered for service in the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War, being appointed mate in October 1862. As acting ensign, he served on board and was in charge of the deck when that ship was attacked by Confederate torpedo boat in Charleston Harbor, on the night of 5 October 1863. Mounting the rail, he ordered the sentries to fire on the approaching enemy, and while exposed he received a mortal wound.

Early years Ryga was born in Deep Creek (54¬∞57'N,113¬∞13'W) near Athabasca, Alberta to poor Ukrainian immigrant parents. Unable to continue his schooling past grade six, he worked at a variety of jobs, including radio copywriter. Ryga continued to study, taking correspondence courses, and winning a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts. In 1955, he traveled to Europe, where he attended the World Assembly for Peace in Helsinki and worked for the BBC. The following year he returned to Canada. Career While living in Edmonton, he published his first book, Song of My Hands (1956), a collection of poems. Ryga's first play, Indian, was performed on television in 1961. He achieved national exposure with The Ecstasy of Rita Joe in 1967. The work, considered by many to be the most important English-language play by a Canadian playwright, is the story of a young native woman arriving in the city who finds that she has no place with either her own people or the white man. It was performed in Vancouver, at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa and in Washington state. In 1971, the work was performed as a ballet by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. Other plays by Ryga include: * Captives of the Faceless Drummer - 1971 * Sunrise on Sarah - 1972 * Portrait of Angelica - 1973 * Ploughmen of the Glacier - 1977 * In the Shadow of the Vulture - 1985 * Paracelsus - 1986 * Summerland - 1992 He made a significant contribution to popular music when he wrote lyrics for a series of songs composed by the members of the Vancouver-based band The Collectors for the soundtrack of his 1969 play Grass and Wild Strawberries. Early Morning, the single release from the resulting Grass & Wild Strawberries album, became a minor local hit, and the showstopping album track Seventeenth Summer was re-recorded by the band after it underwent a membership change and changed its name to Chilliwack. The distinctive track, strongly influenced by First Nations musical forms, became a signature tune in live shows by Chilliwack for many years afterward. Death He died in Summerland, British Columbia in 1987. His home has been turned into the George Ryga Centre, an arts and culture centre. Recognition A biography, The Ecstasy of Resistance, by James Hoffman, was published in 1995. Since 2004, the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature has been presented to a British Columbian writer who has published a book with significant social themes. A wall plaque to commemorate George Ryga was installed in the newly-opened Summerland Library in October of 2015.

He was especially active in the »öara Mo»õilor region and the Apuseni Mountains. The rallying of peasants around him, as well as the allegiance he paid to the Habsburg got him the moniker CrƒÉi»ôorul Mun»õilor (\\"The Prince of the Mountains\\").Ion Ranca, Valeriu Ni»õu, Avram Iancu: documente »ôi bibliografie, Bucharest, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ, 1974 (most contemporary documents about Avram Iancu, including his report to Wohlgemuth) Early life Avram Iancu was born in Vidra de Sus (currently Avram Iancu, Alba County), Transylvania, then part of the Austrian Empire into a family of peasants that had been emancipated from serfdom. His father was Alisandru Iancu (1787-1855) and his mother was Maria Gligor. He had one elder brother, Ion (born 1822), who became a priest. Avram Iancu's grandfather was Gheorghe Iancu (deceased before 1812), who had seven children (four girls and three boys): girls - S√¢ntioana, Maria, Zamfira and Ana; boys - Alisandru (the father), Avram and Ioan. Little is known today about Avram Iancu's childhood. It is known, by local tradition, that he had a typical mo»õ character, joyful and witty and he played well the leaf, alphorn, flute and violin. Avram Iancu attended primary school in his village, in the \\"T√¢rsa\\" hamlet. His teacher was Mihai Gombo»ô. After a while, he was sent by his parents at the school in Neagra (now Poiana Vadului) village. Further, he attended the school from C√¢mpeni, Alba county, his teacher being Mihai Ioanette. He graduated the C√¢mpeni school at age 13. After this, he went to school in Zlatna, where he studied in a Hungarian school, in the Latin language, as Romanian schools didn't exist in this area. His teachers were Iozephus Stanken (1837-1838), Gregorius Iakabus (1838-1839) and Ludovicus Kov√°cs (1839-1840 and 1840-1841). He graduated at age 17. He studied humanities from 1841, in the Piarist College of Cluj, graduating law school. Initial stages of 1848 Revolutions Avram Iancu became a law clerk in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, and it was there that he learned about the events of March 1848 of Vienna and Pest. His attitude at the time showed the nature of the conflict that was to engulf Transylvania: while Iancu welcomed the transition, he was indignant at the fact that Hungarian revolutionaries (many of whom were landowners) refused to debate the abolition of serfdom (which at the time was the state of the larger part of the Romanian population in Transylvania).Ioan N. Ciolan, Constantin Voicu, Mihai Racovi»õan, \\"Transylvania:Romanian history and perpetuation, or, what official Hungarian documents say\\", Military Publishing House, 1993 In the Apuseni Mountains, he started rallying peasants in C√¢mpeni. The protests he organized were recognized as peaceful by the authorities, but nevertheless worried them. Iancu and his associate Ioan Buteanu quickly became the main figures of the Romanian-led actions in the area, especially after they took part in the Blaj Assemblies starting in April, where over 40,000 Romanians met to protest against Transylvania becoming a part of Hungary. In Blaj (; ) both opted for the main, radical wing of the movement. Centered on Alexandru Papiu Ilarian, the group opposed the Hungarian revolutionary option of uniting Transylvania and Hungary. It got into conflict with the minority wing around Greek-Catholic Bishop Ioan Lemeni, one which chose not to boycott the elections for the Hungarian Parliament. While the union was carried of on May 30, 1848, the majority of Romanian activists looked towards Vienna and Emperor Ferdinand, sharing the cause of the Transylvanian Saxons. Things became heated after July 11, when Hungary declared its independence. Austria started to open itself to the Romanian demands, while bloody conflicts ensued between the Hungarian nobles and their Romanian serfs. The last Assembly in Blaj saw the Habsburg governor, Anton Freiherr von Puchner, approve of the arming of National Guards for Romanians and Saxons. On September 27, the lynching of Austrian plenipotentiary Count Lemberg by a Pest crowd cut off any dialogue between the two centers. The new Emperor Franz Joseph and the Austrian government granted the Romanians numerous liberties and rights; although Lajos Kossuth's government abolished serfdom, this was no longer a match for the Imperial offer. Conflict Outbreak The Austrians clearly rejected the October demand that the ethnical criteria become the basis for internal borders, with the goal of creating a province for Romanians (Transylvania grouped alongside Banat and Bukovina), as they did not want to replace the threat of Hungarian nationalism with the potential of Romanian separatism. Yet they did not declare themselves hostile to the rapid creation of Romanian administrative offices within Transylvania. The territory was organized in (\\"prefectures\\"), with Avram Iancu and Buteanu as two prefects in the Apuseni. Iancu's prefecture, the Auraria Gemina (a name charged with Latin symbolism), became the most important one as it took over from bordering areas that were never really fully organized. In the same month, the administrative efforts were put to a halt, as Hungarians under J√≥zef Bem carried out a sweeping offensive through Transylvania. With the discreet assistance of Imperial Russian troops, the Austrian army (except for the garrisons at Alba Iulia and Deva) and the Austrian-Romanian administration retreated to Wallachia and Wallachian Oltenia (both were, at the time, under Russia's occupation). Attrition On 8 November, Avram Iancu, along with his 4,000 combatants of the \\"Auraria Gemina\\" Legion took part in joint military actions with Austrian forces. The Legion reached Turda, and the city surrendered without a fight on 20 November. Then, he and his troops returned to the mountains.Dragomir 1968, p. 118 On 29 November, Avram Iancu had another 1,500 troops mobilized for action. On 4 December, he reached SƒÉcuieu, and on 6-7 December, he and his men were ordered to attack the enemy lines by surprise. However, the attack failed, due to the incompetence of an Austrian officer, and the Romanians were forced to withdraw by 10 December. By early January 1849, the control over Transylvania was almost entirely regained by the Hungarian Army. The Romanian fighters holding out in their mountains stronghold were running low of supplies, having only 800 rifles to arm a few thousand men, and were completely surrounded by Hungarian troops by the end of March.Dragomir 1968, p. 117 In April 1849, Iancu was approached by the Hungarian envoy Ioan Drago≈ü (in fact, a Romanian deputy in the Hungarian Parliament). Drago»ô appeared to have been acting out of his own desire for peace, since Iancu's troops were tying down too many Hungarian troops, about 10,000, a third of the Hungarian Army in Transylvania, according to Hungarian general J√°nos Czecz. He worked hard to get the Romanian leaders to meet him in Abrud and listen to the Hungarian demands. Iancu's direct adversary, Hungarian commander Imre Hatvany, seems to have taken profit on the provisional armistice to attack the Romanians in Abrud.Keith Hitchins, Rom√¢nii 1774-1866, Bucharest, Humanitas, 1996 He did not, however, benefit from a surprise, as Iancu and his men retreated and then encircled him. In the meanwhile, Drago»ô was lynched by the Abrud crowds, in the belief that he was part of Hatvany's ruse. Hatvany also angered the Romanians by having Buteanu captured and murdered. While his position became weaker, he was permanently attacked by Iancu's men, until the major defeat of May 22. Hatvany and most of his armed group were massacred by their adversaries, as Iancu captured their cannons, switching the tactical advantage for the next months. Hatvany's troops lost 5,000 soldiers and all of their artillery. Kossuth was angered by Hatvany's gesture (an inspection of the time dismissed all of Hatvany's close collaborators), especially since it made future negotiations unlikely. On 8 June, the Romanian stronghold in the mountains was attacked by the largest Hungarian force yet: 4,000 men supported by 19 cannons led by General Kemeny Farkas. The battle lasted between 11 and 17 June and ended in a crushing victory for the Romanians, the Hungarians having at least 500 troops killed during the battle. The Russian intervention in June precipitated events, especially since Poles fighting in the Hungarian revolutionary contingents wanted to see an all-out resistance to the Tsarist armies. People like Henryk Dembi≈Ñski mediated for an understanding between Kossuth and the Wallachian √©migr√© revolutionaries. The latter, understandably close to Avram Iancu (especially Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, Gheorghe Magheru, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Ion Ghica) were also keen to inflict a defeat on the Russian armies that had crushed their movement in September 1848. Fighting also continued in July, during the peace negotiations, on 2, 4, and 22 July, all Hungarian attacks being repulsed yet again. Finally, the conflict ended on 29 July, as Avram Iancu offered a guarantee to the Hungarian troops that he would not attack them, allowing them to withdraw in front of the Austro-Russian offensive.Dragomir 1968, pp. 270-271 Negotiations BƒÉlcescu and Kossuth met in May 1849, in Debrecen. The contact has for long been celebrated by Romanian Marxist historians and politicians: Karl Marx's condemnation of everything opposing Kossuth had led to any Romanian initiative being automatically considered \\"reactionary\\". In fact, it appears that the agreement was in no way a pact: Kossuth meant to flatter the Wallachians, by getting them to champion the idea of Iancu's armies leaving Transylvania for good, in order to help BƒÉlcescu in Bucharest. While agreeing to mediate for peace, BƒÉlcescu never presented these terms to the fighters in the Apuseni. His personal documents (commented by Liviu Maior) show that the un-realistic assumptions of Kossuth had made him view the Hungarian leader as a \\"demagogue\\".Liviu Maior, 1848-1849. Rom√¢ni »ôi unguri √Æn revolu»õie, Bucharest, Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, 1998 Even more contradictory, the only thing Avram Iancu agreed to (and which no party had asked for) was his forces' \\"neutrality\\" in the conflict between Russia and Hungary. Thus, he secured his position as the Hungarian armies suffered defeats in July, culminating in the Battle of Segesv√°r (Sighi≈üoara), and then the capitulation of August 13. Later years Avram Iancu Square with National Theater of Cluj and the statue of Avram Iancu. Avram Iancu agreed to disarm as soon as the Austrians took over, and wrote a detailed report to the new governor of Transylvania, General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth (in 1850). In order to avoid suspicion of Romanian separatism, the document does not mention the contacts with the Wallachians. As the Austrians granted the abolition of serfdom, they also forbade all representative institutions in Transylvania. While Hungarian nationalism was slowly fitting in the pattern that would make the Ausgleich acceptable for both sides involved, the Romanian option raised more and more irritation. The revolutionary zeal it had found under Iancu, although profiting the Monarchy, could also prove to be a weapon used for very different goals (the Austrians were especially fearful that the Greek Orthodox faith of the Romanians would accommodate itself with Pan-Slavism, completing the gap between Serbia and the Russian Empire). It is very possible that Iancu was not able to properly observe the new status quo. While the decision for his initial arrest (in December 1849) was quickly overturned after local protests (and explained as an abuse), he was censored throughout his life, had his library confiscated, and was placed under surveillance. He was even arrested a second time, in 1852, after it was presumed that his presence alone served to inflame local sentiments. Local traditions http://www.curentul.net/2015/03/15/apel-la-memoria-romanismului-replici- celebre-ale-lui-avram-iancu/hold that the emperor Franz Joseph was visiting Transylvania and on July 21st, 1852 he was in the Apuseni Mountains area, purportedly to attend The Maidens' Fair on GƒÉina Mountain but also hoping that Iancu would agree to meet him. Allegedly, Iancu refused, uttering his famous line \\"It's all for naught, a madman and a liar can't by any means come to understand each other\\". Soon after his release, Iancu visited Vienna and attempted to petition the Emperor. He was prevented to do so by the police, a public humiliation which provoked a nervous breakdown that had an impact on the rest of his life. He was marginalized by the authorities who didn't allow Romanians to have their own say in Transylvania about their own autonomy. Being treated as peripheral by the people in power, he spent the rest of his life traveling the Apuseni Mountains, as a half-mad vagrant, living out of whatever alms that the impoverished mo»õi population could spare for him, singing sad Romanian doina songs on his flute. Avram Iancu in his late, half- mad years Avram Iancu died on September 10, 1872 at Baia de Cri»ô. His body was buried, according to his wish, under Horea's tree in »öebea (by tradition, the place where the Revolt of Horea, Clo»ôca and Cri»ôan had started). Avram Iancu's tomb in »öebea Avram Iancu was officially declared as a Hero of the Romanian Nation in November 2016 by the Romanian Parliament and the president Klaus Iohannis.

Allen was born in Cornwall but moved to Bath to work in the post office becoming the postmaster at the age of 19. He made the system more efficient and took over contracts for the mail system to cover England to the borders of Scotland and into South Wales. He also bought the initial local stone mines from his postal profits and had Prior Park built as his house to show off the versatility of the local Bath stone, using the old post office as his town house. With the architect John Wood, the Elder the stone he mined was used in the building work for the development of the Georgian city. However, the mines did not consistently make a profit and Allen subsidised them from his postal profits. After his death, he was buried in a pyramid-topped tomb in Claverton churchyard. He is commemorated in the names of streets and schools in the city of Bath and was the model for Squire Allworthy in the novel Tom Jones by Henry Fielding. Early life Allen's early life is unclear and various sources give different information. He may have been baptised at St Columb Major in Cornwall on 24 July 1693; however, this baptism shows the father as Philip Allen, while the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography gives his parents as John Allen and Mary Elliott. As a teenager, he worked at the Post Office run by his grandmother. He moved in 1710 to Bath, where he became a post office clerk, and at the age of 19, in 1712, became the Postmaster of Bath.Staff, Frank (1966). The Penny Post, 1680‚Äì1918, p. 57. London: Lutterworth Press In 1742 he was elected Mayor of Bath. Involvement in the postal system At the age of 27 Allen took control of the Cross and Bye Posts in the South West under a seven-year contract with the General Post Office, although he had no official title. At the end of this period he had not made a profit, only breaking even. But he had the courage to continue ‚Äì with breathtaking success. Over the next few years, he reformed the postal service. He realised that post boys were delivering items of mail along their route without them being declared and that this was lost profit. He introduced a \\"signed for system\\" that prevented the malpractice. He also improved efficiency by not requiring mail to go via London. Ralph Allen's reputation grew and he took over more and more of the English postal system, signing contracts every seven years until he died aged 71. It is estimated that he saved the Post Office ¬£1,500,000 over a 40-year period. He won the patronage of General Wade in 1715, when he disclosed details of a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall. Quarrying of Bath stone With the arrival of John Wood in Bath, Allen used the wealth gained from his postal reforms to acquire the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. Hitherto, the quarry masons had always hewn stone roughly providing blocks of varying size. The resulting uneven surface is known as \\"rubble\\" and buildings of this type ‚Äì built during the Stuart period ‚Äì are visible throughout the older parts of Bath. The distinctive honey- coloured Bath stone, used to build the Georgian city, made Allen a second fortune. The building in Lilliput Alley, Bath (now North Parade Passage), which he used as a post office, became his Town House and in 1727 he refronted the southern rubble wall, extended the house to the north and added a whole new storey. John Wood the Elder refers to this in his \\"Essay towards the future of Bath\\". Allen was extremely astute at marketing the qualities of Bath Stone and erected an elaborately ornate building a few feet to the north of his house to demonstrate its qualities. The extension (as Wood refers to it) has become known as \\"Ralph Allen's Town House\\" though whether it was designed by Wood is unproven and many local historians consider it unlikely. Allen continued to live there until 1745, when he moved to Prior Park, and the townhouse became his offices. Prior Park House, home of Ralph Allen Allen had the Palladian mansion Prior Park built for himself (1742) on a hill overlooking the city, \\"To see all Bath, and for all Bath to see\\". He gave money and the stone for the building of the Mineral Water Hospital in 1738. Allen had a summer home built in the English coastal town of Weymouth in Dorset, overlooking the harbour at number 2 Trinity street, opposite the Customs house. There is a plaque on the house to commemorate Allen. His Bath stone was used to build the Georgian style buildings in Weymouth. Commemoration Ralph Allen is buried in a pyramid-topped tomb in Claverton churchyard, on the outskirts of Bath, which is the subject of a fundraising campaign to pay for its badly-needed renovation. A marble bust stood in the Mineral Water Hospital (later the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases) and was moved to the hospital's new building at Combe Park in 2019. His name is commemorated in Ralph Allen Drive which runs past his former home at Prior Park. Now a busy road from Combe Down village to Bath city centre, this was the route by which the stone from his quarries at Combe Down was sent on wooden sledges down to the River Avon. Prior Park College, a private school for 11- to 18-year-olds, is housed in Allen's former home and incorporates a boys' boarding house named Allen House. The Prior Park Landscape Garden and Palladian bridge are cared for by the National Trust, who brought the garden back from dereliction in 1993. He is also remembered in Ralph Allen School, one of the city's state secondary schools. The Ralph Allen CornerStone in Combe Down village opened in the autumn of 2013. This houses the archives of the Combe Down Heritage Society and provides a community hub and information centre as part of the legacy of the project to infill the stone mines underneath the village. Henry Fielding used Allen as the model for Squire Allworthy in the novel Tom Jones. Bibliography  *Hopkins, A.E. (ed.)

It may have been originally settled by Quakers, but during the Industrial Revolution it developed into a mining village with traditional terraced houses. The Quaker origin is supported by the 1873 name for a mine with two shafts at the village called Quaker House Pit. However, an alternative origin is suggested by the following; the 1865 OS Map shows a farm called Quaking House to the north at Anniefield Plain and a colliery railway line ran past this farm branching to the village mine. This colliery railway line was called the Quaking House Branch Line. A colloquial name for the village was \\"banana goat island\\" perhaps reflecting the livestock kept in the extensive allotments and grazing area around the village. Accessible by road only from the main South Moor Road, the village is dominated by one large road, with large strips of terraced housing on either side, both facing outwards. The large road is divided into several different street names: Third Street and Foil Cloth Street, with Woodside Terrace and Fellside Terrace located at the west end. A large turning circle enables large vehicles, particularly buses, to change direction. A shorter road parallel to the large road once had two streets, First Street and Second Street. The Community Hall which opened in 1997 stands where First street was once situated and Second Street still remains. The original housing stock was tied property which passed to the National Coal Board following nationalisation of the coal industry. The properties in Fellside and Woodside Terrace were larger than the other properties and were originally occupied by people with \\"middle management\\" occupations in the mining industry. As the coal mining industry declined these properties were progressively sold off into private ownership. In the 1960s, Quaking Houses was declared a Category D village under the County Durham development plan. Category D villages were to be left to die with the mining industry and planning consents for further development were to be refused. The Category D policy waned over time and new housing development has taken place. At one time at the bottom of Fourth Street stood a walled reservoir and at the top of the village on the fell in the woodland was a dam, both of which had been required for the mines in the area. The William Pit, colloquially known as the Billy Pit, and which, prior to nationalisation, was owned by the South Moor and Holmside Colliery Company [SM&HCC;] stood near the reservoir. SM&HCC; also operated a drift mine in the Stanley Burn valley to the north of Woodside Terrace. Quaking Houses fell, which is an outstanding example of lowland heath, sweeps down towards Fourth Street and Fellside Terrace. The village is often colloquially referred to as 'Quakies'.

There was a branch of Stanley Co-op at the bottom of Park Rd and a glove factory above it. On the opposite side in a walled garden stood the Colliery Offices for the district. A local meeting place for teenagers in the 1950s and 1960s was Boves caf√© which had a jukebox and sold coffee and snacks.

The section of the park adjacent to Park Road features a bowling green and a public, concrete tennis court. Recent new development in the area has meant that the park is now undergoing refurbishment work. The west side of the park is completely wooded. The main path follows the course of the stream. The remains of the bandstand is hidden by trees and growth and the remains of a previous paddling pool could be seen opposite the bandstand. This was well used in the thirties by locals.

The duo were a much anticipated reunion and music critics praised their first concerts and debut album, Here Come the Tears. However, the project was short-lived as they disbanded in 2006, which allowed Anderson to focus on his solo career and Butler to become a full-time producer. History In 1994, when Bernard Butler walked out of Suede, they were the biggest new band in Britain. He was pilloried in the music press and characterised as \\"demanding, difficult and egotistical\\" by Brett Anderson.Author unknown. \\"The guitar man finds his voice\\". Daily Telegraph. 8 October 1998 \\"When he left the band we pretty much hated each other as much as two people can hate each other,\\" admitted Anderson in an interview with The Times. The pair parted company in July 1994 while recording Suede's second album Dog Man Star, which resulted in a major fallout due to musical differences and Anderson's hedonistic lifestyle. As Suede soldiered on and Butler forged a solo career, both with varying degrees of success, they continued to snipe at each other in the press. Though Butler and Anderson had not spoken to each other for nine years, Anderson claimed getting back in touch with Butler was not difficult. The band decided on being named after a line from a Philip Larkin poem, Femmes Damn√©es,MacNeil, Jason. \\"Ex-Suede Mates Form The Tears\\". Billboard.com. 21 October 2004. which ends with the line: \\"The only sound heard is the sound of tears\\". The band played their first ever live show on 14 December 2004 at the Oxford Zodiac.Sutherland, Mark. \\"Brett & Bernard stay together\\". BBC 6 Music. 15 December 2004 Things went as expected for the \\"new\\" band, and most new songs were received well by those attending the first set of shows. When asked during a concert by a fan to play Suede song, \\"The Drowners\\", Anderson replied saying, \\"Did somebody say they wanted to hear \\"The Drowners\\"? You‚Äôve come to the wrong gig, mate.\\"Sinclair, David. \\"Pop: The Tears\\". The Times. 18 December 2004 Apart from relatively minor reviews of the first clutch of live shows, The Tears' first press was a review of \\"Refugees\\", an interview with Anderson, and a poster in The Sun on 15 April. The next major article was by Alexis Petridis in The Guardian, which ended on an extremely optimistic note: \\"the pair seem artistically reinvigorated by each other's company. Anderson talks excitedly of Tears songs like the ballad Asylum, inspired by his father's struggle with depression, as having moved away from ‚ÄòSuede cliches or Brett Anderson cliches ... it's not, you know, opiated fop territory.‚Äô\\"Petridis, Alexis. \\"Frankly I hated Suede\\". The Guardian. 22 April 2005 From the start, Anderson was insistent that the band would not be playing any songs by Suede.Saney, Daniel. \\"Suede's Anderson on new band\\". Digital Spy. 7 March 2005 Things would change over time, however, as the band ended up playing the B-side, \\"The Living Dead\\", to an enthusiastic reception, during an encore for their show at the Sheffield Leadmill in April.\\"Treat for Suede heads!\\". NME. 20 April 2005 In April 2005, the band's first single, \\"Refugees\\", was released. The single was a success and peaked in the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The band's debut album, Here Come the Tears followed on 6 June 2005. It was released to generally favourable reviews that helped solidify the duo's comeback. However it failed to crack the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart. Anderson felt that the project was eclipsed by the curiosity in the reconciliation with Butler, saying: \\"...the story of me and Bernard getting back together again was far too juicy, and it overshadowed the music completely. I am proud of the record we made, but the obsession with us stopped us enjoying it.\\"McNulty, Bernadette. \\"The return of Britpop's lost boy\\". The Daily Telegraph. 22 March 2007. In late June, the band played a set at the John Peel stage at the Glastonbury Festival. The second single from the debut album, entitled \\"Lovers\\", was released in June. Though a significantly lower charting than the previous single, it still managed to reach number 24. More than a month later, Anderson announced that he would release his long-awaited solo album in between the touring for Here Come the Tears, and the release of the band's follow up album. After playing several festivals including Glastonbury and T in the Park along with international gigs, the band announced a European tour with dates in October and November. However, the tour was soon cancelled and the band were dropped from their label. In late April 2006, Anderson posted a message on the band's message board announcing the band were on temporary hiatus because \\"no one ever wanted this thing to get caught up within the drudgery of the whole tour/record/tour cycle anyway\\". In addition, he announced that he had completed his debut solo album and that it would see light in early 2007, hinting that the second Tears record would most likely come after that. In August 2006, the band's official site and forum were closed. In 2007, Anderson admitted in an interview that The Tears were about to write their second album, however they decided to split because they were simply not enjoying it. Asked about a second record, Anderson replied. \\"The chance of there being another Tears record in the future is pretty good actually.\\" These hopes were short-lived, however when Butler announced his retirement from performing in 2008 to concentrate on producing.Leonard, Michael. \\"Bernard Butler retires from performing\\".

The term is a broad, generic one and most such workers are primarily described by the specific level and type of work they perform. For example, laborers carry out a wide range of practical tasks to help tradespersons on construction sites. They clean the construction site on a regular basis using tools such as rakes, shovels, and wheelbarrows to remove rubble, scraps of metal, and wood. They might also need to sweep out certain areas and put building supplies in order. Construction workers may colloquially be referred to as \\"hard hat workers\\" or \\"hard hats\\", as they often wear hard hats for safety.  Safety  Construction safety is intended to ensure a safe environment for workers, who are required to be educated on safety at each site. Examples of poor pay and working conditions for migrant workers In 2008, a Human Rights Watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions in China and a failure on the part of the government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that, at the end of 2006, 90% of the 40 million construction workers in China were migrant workers. Many turned to work after their farming communities collapsed into poverty. In the United States, illegal immigrant labor is prevalent in the industry.

Manueline ornamentation in the cloisters of Jer√≥nimos Monastery, Bel√©m (Lisbon) The Manueline (, ), occasionally known as Portuguese late Gothic, is the sumptuous, composite Portuguese architectural style originating in the 16th century, during the Portuguese Renaissance and Age of Discoveries. Manueline architecture incorporates maritime elements and representations of the discoveries brought from the voyages of Vasco da Gama and Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. This innovative style synthesizes aspects of Late Gothic Flamboyant architecture with original motifs and influences of the Plateresque, Mud√©jar, Italian, and Flemish architecture. It marks the transition from Late Gothic to Renaissance. The construction of churches and monasteries in Manueline was largely financed by proceeds of the lucrative spice trade with Africa and India. The style was given its name, many years later, by Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book, Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica, in his description of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery. Varnhagen named the style after King Manuel I, whose reign (1495‚Äì1521) coincided with its development. The style was much influenced by the astonishing successes of the voyages of discovery of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa to the discovery of Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East, drawing heavily on the style and decorations of East Indian temples. Although the period of this style did not last long (from 1490 to 1520), it played an important part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, painting, works of art made of precious metals, faience and furniture. Characteristics This decorative style is characterized by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar. Several elements appear regularly in these intricately carved stoneworks: Royal Cloister of the Batalha Monastery * elements used on ships: the armillary sphere (a navigational instrument and the personal emblem of Manuel I and also symbol of the cosmos), spheres, anchors, anchor chains, ropes and cables. * elements from the sea, such as shells, pearls and strings of seaweed. * botanical motifs such as laurel branches, oak leaves, acorns, poppy capsules, corncobs, thistles. * symbols of Christianity such as the cross of the Order of Christ (former Knights Templar), the military order that played a prominent role and helped finance the first voyages of discovery. The cross of this order decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships. * elements from newly discovered lands (such as the tracery in the Royal Cloister of the Batalha Monastery, suggesting Islamic filigree work, influenced by buildings in India) * columns carved like twisted strands of rope * semicircular arches (instead of Gothic pointed arches) of doors and windows, sometimes consisting of three or more convex curves * multiple pillars * eight-sided capitals * lack of symmetry * conical pinnacles * bevelled crenellations * ornate portals with niches or canopies. Examples Convent of Christ in Tomar is a well-known example of Manueline style When King Manuel I died in 1521, he had funded 62 construction projects. However, much original Manueline architecture in Portugal was lost or damaged beyond restoration in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and subsequent tsunami. In Lisbon, the Ribeira Palace, residence of King Manuel I, and the Hospital Real de Todos os Santos were destroyed, along with several churches. The city, however, still has outstanding examples of the style in the Jer√≥nimos Monastery (mainly designed by Diogo Boitac and Jo√£o de Castilho) and in the small fortress of the Bel√©m Tower (designed by Francisco de Arruda). Both are located close to each other in the Bel√©m neighbourhood. The portal of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Velha, in downtown Lisbon, has also survived destruction. Manueline exterior of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Lisbon. Outside Lisbon, the church and chapter house of the Convent of Christ at Tomar (designed by Diogo de Arruda) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic sculptured organic and twisted rope forms, is one of the most extraordinary achievements of the Manueline style. Other major Manueline monuments include the arcade screens of the Royal Cloister (designed by Diogo Boitac) and the Unfinished Chapels (designed by Mateus Fernandes) at the Monastery of Batalha and the Royal Palace of Sintra. Other remarkable Manueline buildings include the church of the Monastery of Jesus of Set√∫bal (one of the earliest Manueline churches, also designed by Diogo Boitac), the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra, the main churches in Goleg√£, Vila do Conde, Moura, Caminha, Oliven√ßa and portions of the cathedrals of Braga (main chapel), Viseu (rib vaulting of the nave) and Guarda (main portal, pillars, vaulting). Civil buildings in Manueline style exist in √âvora (home to the √âvora Royal Palace of 1525, by Pedro de Trillo, Diogo de Arruda and Francisco de Arruda) and the Castle of √âvoramonte of 1531), Viana do Castelo, Guimar√£es and some other towns. The style was extended to the decorative arts and spread throughout the Portuguese Empire, to the islands of the Azores, Madeira, enclaves in North Africa, Brazil, Goa in Portuguese India and even Macau, China. Its influence is apparent in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, North Africa and the former Spanish colonies of Peru and Mexico.

He subsequently went on to field a succession of Green Monster turbine-engined pulling tractors, before returning to land speed record racing. He was announced as a 2008 inductee in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame three days after his death. Family Art Arfons' father, Tom, was born in Greece and came to the United States at age 14. He settled in Akron, Ohio, where Art was born. Tom died in 1950, at age 52. His mother, Bessie, was half Cherokee, and died in 1983 at age 84. Arfons had two half brothers by his mother -- Walt Arfons, ten years older, who was to become his partner and later competitor in motor sports, and Dale, eight years older, as well as one sister \\"Lou\\", eighteen months older.  Early life  Arfons' family operated a feed mill in rural Ohio, where the Arfons brothers exercised their mechanical skills and ingenuity. After his junior year of high school, at just under 17 years of age, Art joined the United States Navy. He was sent to diesel mechanic school, then assigned as a mechanic to a landing craft in the Pacific Theater. This was a very good job for Arfons to utilize his mechanical talents. He participated in two battles including the invasion of Okinawa, and then was discharged after three years, as a Petty Officer Second Class. He returned to Ohio, was married, and had two sons and a daughter. In 1952, he and his half-brother Walt became fascinated with drag racing and built their first Green Monster. In this endeavor, they were supported by their mother, who was also fascinated by the sport. Art and Walt continued their drag racing partnership with a series of Green Monster cars until the late 1950s, parting amicably but competing against each other.  Land speed record  Arfons' path led almost inevitably to land speed record racing at Bonneville, first in 1960 with the \\"Anteater\\", a car modeled after John Cobb's \\"Railton Special\\" and powered by an Allison V-1710 aircraft engine. In 1961 he reached a top speed of before burning out the clutch. Arfons sold the car to Bob Motz. In 1962, Arfons began experimenting with jet-powered cars, where his innate mechanical skills proved tremendously useful. Art's first car, the 8,000 hp (6 MW) Cyclops, remains the fastest open cockpit vehicle, recording 330.113 miles per hour (531.265 km/h) in the measured mile in 1962. Unfortunately, his design had the driver sitting directly in the air intake to the engine, so that there was no way to enclose the cockpit and still supply air to the engine; this limited top speed severely. In deference to the car's less-than-excellent aerodynamics, Arfons introduced another innovation: It was the first land speed record car to utilize a wing to produce downforce to prevent the car from becoming airborne. The Green Monster Land Speed Record car Arfons returned to Bonneville in 1964 with another Green Monster. He held the world land speed record three times during the closely fought competition of 1964 and 1965, but after a bad crash in 1966 turned his attention to jet turbine powered tractor pulling competition where he was, as usual, successful. In 1979 he won his only NTPA championship in the 9200 Modified class. In 1989, however, he attempted to return to land speed record competition, but was never competitive. Art's son, Tim Arfons, has continued the tradition by competing in jet-powered dragsters as well as in turbine- powered pulling \\"funny cars\\", and has been a stunt and exhibition driver in a series of jet-powered ATVs and even a jet-powered personal watercraft. His daughter Allison \\"Dusty\\" Arfons, named after the aircraft engine in the Anteater, also competed in tractor pulling with her father. His oldest son Ronald Arthur Arfons, died on October 23, 2006 at age 58. Tragedy On October 16, 1971, while making an exhibition run at the Dallas International Motor Speedway in Lewisville, Texas, Arfons lost control of his radical jet- powered vehicle, resulting in the death of three people. IHRA staff members Robert John Kelsey (age 20) and Sean Pence (age 17) were struck and killed, along with WFAA (Dallas, Texas) news reporter, Gene Thomas (age 31), who was a passenger in the vehicle. Arfons' \\"Super Cyclops\\" was making its first run of the day in an attempt to pass the mark. Near the end of the run, a tire burst as the parachutes deployed; it veered into a guard rail and crashed beyond the finish line. Thomas, a popular Dallas television reporter, was apparently thrown out of the vehicle when it rolled over. The vehicle was configured with the driver and passenger sitting on each side of a huge engine. Arfons sustained minor injuries. He was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and released shortly afterward. The Dallas event was to be his last race.  Award  He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America and the International Drag Racing Hall of Fame (prior to 2005) \\"Hall of Fame Inductees\\", International Motorsports Hall of Fame, National Tractor Puller Association Hall of Fame, and the Summit County Sports Hall of Fame. He is a three time World Land Speed record holder. He held the Unlimited Drag Racing Record and was a champion Tractor Puller. *He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1991.Art Arfons at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America  Death and interment  Arfons died on December 3, 2007, in Springfield Township, Ohio, at the age of 81.

Rangda is the demon queen of the Leyaks in Bali, according to traditional Balinese mythology. Terrifying to behold, the child- eating Rangda leads an army of evil witches against the leader of the forces of good ‚Äî Barong. The battle between Barong and Rangda is featured in a Barong dance which represents the eternal battle between good and evil. Rangda is a term in old Javanese that means \\"widow\\".  Description  Rangda is important in Balinese culture, and performances depicting her struggles with Barong or with Airlangga are popular tourist attractions as well as tradition. She is depicted as a mostly nude old woman, with long and unkempt hair, pendulous breasts, and claws. Her face is traditionally a horrifying fanged and goggle- eyed mask, with a long, protruding tongue.  History  Bali is a Hindu island, and it is suggested that Rangda may also be closely associated with Durga. She has also been identified with the Hindu but tribal mother warrior goddess, and Kali, the black mother goddess of destruction, transformation and protection in Sanskritised tribal Hinduism. While Rangda is seen as fearsome and by many as the personification of evil, she is also nevertheless considered a protective force in certain parts of Bali, much like Kali is seen as a benevolent mother goddess of fertility and destruction in Northeastern India in Assam, Tripura. The colors associated with her ‚Äî white, black and red ‚Äî are identical with those associated with Kali. Her iconography is similar to that of both Kali and Chamunda, who are closely related. Rangda was linked to the legend of Calon Arang and also the legend of divorced and exiled Javanese queen Mahendradatta. The name Rangda in old Javanese and Balinese language means \\"widow\\".  Calon Arang  Rangda is known as a Leyak queen, the incarnation of Calon Arang, the legendary witch that wreaked havoc in ancient Java during the reign of Airlangga in late 10th century. It is said that Calon Arang was a widow, who has mastered the art of black magic, who often damaged farmers' crops and caused disease to come. She had a daughter, named Ratna Manggali, who, though beautiful, could not get a husband because people were afraid of her mother. Because of the difficulties faced by her daughter, Calon Arang was angry and she intended to take revenge by kidnapping a young girl. She brought the girl to a temple of Death to be sacrificed to the goddess Durga. The next day, a great flood engulfed the village and many people died. Disease also appeared. King Airlangga, who had heard of this matter, then asked for his advisor, Empu Bharada, to deal with this problem. Empu Bharada then sent his disciple, Empu Bahula, to be married to Ratna. Both were married with a huge feast that lasted seven days and seven nights, and the situation returned to normal. Calon Arang had a book that contained magic incantations. One day, this book was found by Empu Bahula, who turned it over to Empu Bharada. As soon as Calon Arang knew that the book had been stolen, she became angry and decided to fight Empu Bharada. Without the help of Durga, Calon Arang was defeated. Since she was defeated, the village was safe from the threat of Calon Arang's black magic. Other interpretations claim that Rangda was actually derived from the historical 11th-century queen Mahendradatta or Gunapriyadharmapatni, a Javanese princess sister of Dharmawangsa of East Javanese Isyana Dynasty of late Medang Kingdom period. She was the queen consort of Balinese king Udayana and Airlangga's own mother. Mahendradatta is known for her devotion to the cult of Durga in Bali. The story goes that Mahendradatta, the mother of Airlangga, was condemned and exiled by the king, Udayana, for allegedly practising witchcraft and black magic. After she became a widow, hurt and humiliated, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband's court and the whole of his kingdom. She summoned all the evil spirits in the jungle, the Leyaks and the demons that caused plague and death in the kingdom. She proceeded to take her revenge by killing off half the kingdom, which by then belonged to her and Dharmodayana's son Airlangga, with plague before being overcome by a holy man.

First seen from the air and examined from the ground by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1957, it was so named because of the recovery of the expedition's vehicles which repeatedly broke into bridged crevasses on this glacier during the early stages of the crossing of Antarctica. It is at least 100 km (60 mi) long and 64 km (40 mi) wide at its mouth. Dana Floricioiu and Irena Hajnsek of the German Aerospace Centre spoke on the radar data showing the interior of the Recovery Glacier at the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium in Cape Town, South Africa, in July 2009. The data comes from the German public-private satellite Terrasar-X and when combined with Radarsat-1 shows the changes in the glacier over 11 years. The Recovery Ice Stream that drains part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet into the glacier is nearly long and feeds the Filchner Ice Shelf over the Weddell Sea. The area contains four subglacial lakes, causing the ice flow rate to vary dramatically, ranging between 2 and 50 meters per year. The ice stream drains about 35 billion tons of water and ice into the ocean each year, while the entire East Antarctic ice sheet releases about 57 billion tons a year. The Blackwall Ice Stream joins Recovery Glacier between the Argentina Range and the Whichaway Nunataks.

After taking a break in activity in 1975 for each member to release a solo album and their 1976 North American tour, the band relocated to Montreux, Switzerland to record their next studio album. During rehearsals keyboardist Patrick Moraz left the group, which marked the return of Rick Wakeman who had left to pursue a solo career after differences surrounding Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973). In a departure from their previous albums, Going for the One features shorter and more direct songs without a concept and saw Yes record with new engineering personnel and cover artists. Going for the One received a mostly positive response from music critics who welcomed the band's return to more accessible music. It was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks and No. 8 on the US Billboard 200. \\"Wonderous Stories\\" and \\"Going for the One\\" were released as singles; the former went to No. 7 in the UK and remains the band's highest charting single in the country. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) within a month for selling 500,000 copies. Yes supported the album with a six-month tour of North America and Europe. A remastered edition was released in 2003 containing previously unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions.  Background and writing  In August 1975, Yes wrapped their 1974‚Äì1975 tour of North America and the UK in support of their seventh studio album, Relayer (1974). The line-up during this time was lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Patrick Moraz. For their next move, the group decided to take an extended break so each member could record and release a solo album. They regrouped for their 1976 tour of North America from May to August, which saw Yes perform some of their highest attended concerts. By October 1976, the band had become tax exiles and relocated to Montreux, Switzerland, to record a new studio album at Mountain Studios, their first studio album recorded overseas. They arrived at the studio when Emerson, Lake & Palmer were supposed to have finished Works (1977) but they were running overtime, leaving the group to work at a rehearsal space nearby for several weeks. A substantial amount of writing and arranging of their new material was done during this time. In the first two months of writing and recording, Moraz was let go from the band, which he did not expect. Anderson thought he \\"just wasn't playing like he was involved\\", and that his sound was not \\"too good, and that affected his vibe ... it was obvious that he just wasn't getting off on what we were doing.\\" Several months after his exit, Moraz said he had to leave because of \\"the enormous psychological pressures at the time within the group ... I felt there were a few things going on that I didn't know ... Unfortunately some people did not play the game fair, although the final decision was taken by all members.\\" The decision was made after Rick Wakeman, who had left Yes in 1974 over differences surrounding their ambitious double album Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) and whom Moraz replaced, was invited to play on Going for the One as a session musician by Yes manager Brian Lane and business partner Alex Scott. Wakeman had pursued a successful solo career but by mid-1976, he faced money issues after his tour earlier in the year had met its minimal targets. He became interested to play with Yes again after he had heard a tape of early versions of two of their new songs, \\"Going for the One\\" and \\"Wonderous Stories\\". Upon his arrival at Switzerland, Wakeman was surprised by how much the band had changed. \\"We began relating to each other for the first time. I think we had all grown up and became much more mature. Maybe I had to grow up more than them.\\" At a subsequent party held by Claude Nobs, Lane and Squire convinced Wakeman to become a full time member as the group would have difficulty in finding a suitable replacement to play Wakeman's parts on their upcoming tour, but did not tell him that they had already informed the press of his return. Wakeman found out when he saw himself on the front cover of Melody Maker which had printed the news on 4 December 1976.Wakeman, Rick. YesYears documentary (1991)  Recording  Wakeman played the organ at St. Martin's church in Vevey on \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Awaken\\" while the rest of the band played in the recording studio In a departure from their previous four studio albums, Yes recorded Going for the One with new engineering personnel. Since 1970, they had worked with audio engineer and producer Eddy Offord, who also mixed the band's live sound in concert. After their Relayer tour, however, Offord thought the band's style had become \\"a bit stale\\", and thought a break from the band to pursue other projects was needed. Offord was replaced by recording engineer John Timperley, who was assisted by David Richards. In a first for the band, the album was produced entirely by Yes. It is also the first engineering job for Yes' future sound mixer Nigel Luby, who \\"did little more than watch and acquaint myself with the equipment.\\" Squire recalled numerous heated arguments over the use of echo on the album, as some members liked it and others did not. After constructing extended tracks since 1973, Yes decided to scale things back and record songs that critic and author Chris Welch described as \\"user friendly\\". In one instance, Howe recalled the band had started to arrange \\"another five- minute introduction\\" to a song before they abandoned it and realised \\"there are more ways of getting into songs [...] it was time to go back\\". As Anderson described the album's direction: In addition to recording at Mountain Studios, the organ on \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Awaken\\" were played on the church organ at St. Martin's church in the town of Vevey, some four miles away. The band thought of hiring a mobile recording studio to record on location, but they were advised to rent a telephone line for the day as the quality of the country's lines are of high fidelity and can be fed through directly to the studio in Montreux. With Wakeman in the church and the rest of the band in the studio, White counted the band in and they played the song through. Wakeman described the experience as \\"absolute magic\\". Wakeman changed his sound on the album with the use of a Polymoog, a polyphonic analogue synthesiser, which supplemented his traditional use of the Mellotron, Hammond organ, the RMI Electra Piano, and the monophonic Minimoog synthesizer.  Songs   Side one  \\"Going for the One\\" was originally written by Anderson around two or three years before the album was recorded. He had presented the song to the group at that time but the other members chose not to develop it further. When it came to selecting material for Going for the One, Anderson presented the song once more and it was selected for the album. Its meaning was inspired from a variety of ideas, including sport, horse racing, a film he once saw about \\"going down the Grand Canyon river on one of those rubber dinghies\\", and \\"the cosmic mind\\". Howe plays a steel guitar for the entire song, a first in his tenure with the group. Some years later, he viewed the track as \\"a dynamic piece of music\\" that was underrated and an underplayed song of the band's repertoire. \\"Turn of the Century\\" is credited to Anderson, Howe and White, the only track on the album that credits the latter as a writer. The song tells the story of Roan, a sculptor whose wife dies in the winter and, while in grief of her death, carves a statue of her and she is brought back to life. Anderson gained the idea from the opera La boh√®me, with additional inspiration from the Greek mythological figure Pygmalion, who falls in love with a statue of a woman that he carved. It was considerably shorter in length in its original form, but as the band continued to develop the song further Anderson suggested the song should tell the story musically before he added lyrics. White came up with the song's chord sequences on piano and also wrote the initial vocal melody, which Anderson took a liking to and wrote words for: the chords were later developed further in certain sections by Howe.\\"Legendary YES Drummer ALAN WHITE: ‚ÄúYES is All About Looking Over The Horizon, Not At It‚Äù \\" - article in Sonic Perspectives by Scott Medina, 13 June 2019 White also wrote the section where the drums incorporate the tympani towards the end. The opening minutes of the track became one of Howe's favourite pieces of music by the band. \\"Parallels\\" was part of a collection of songs that Squire had written for his solo album Fish Out of Water (1975), but were left out due to the limited capacity of a vinyl record. He also felt the song did not fit with the style of the other tracks on his album.Kirkman, Jon (2007). \\"Interview With Chris Squire\\". In Fish Out of Water Deluxe Expanded Edition (Disc 2, track 3). Sanctuary Records Group Ltd. When it came to selecting songs for Going for the One, Squire suggested the song for the group to record, which was received well by the other members. In its rough form, the song contained no guitar riffs. Its lyrics address the idea of hope, a recurring theme of Squire's lyrics.  Side two  \\"Wonderous Stories\\" is the second track on the album solely written by Anderson. He wrote the song during \\"a beautiful day\\" while living in Switzerland, \\"one of those days you want to remember for years afterwards\\". During the day, the lyrics to the track entered his mind that he later wrote down. He noted the song's meaning as \\"the joys of life, as opposed to the uptightedness of some aspects of life\\" that was inspired by romantic stories and \\"a kind of dream sequence\\". White contributed the idea of the drums and bass playing on odd beats. \\"Awaken\\" is credited to Anderson and Howe. Anderson first thought of the song when he started to read The Singer: A Classic Retelling of Cosmic Conflict (1975) by Calvin Miller while living in Switzerland, who details \\"an ageless hymn\\" about a \\"star song that is sung every now and again\\". Anderson drew further inspiration from a book about the life of Dutch painter Rembrandt, which had affected him \\"quite significantly\\". The music originated from an incident at a hotel when Anderson heard Howe repeatedly play a chord sequence on his guitar as he walked by, which led Anderson to sing some lyrical ideas on top of it on tape. Howe had written the beginning of the guitar solo previously, which was originally to be a part of a solo guitar piece. Moraz wrote an introduction for the song which was not used, but was adapted into \\"Time for a Change\\" on his solo album Out in the Sun (1977). Anderson wished to incorporate the harp into the song's middle section and \\"dream the audience, sort of Vivaldi\\", and later considered the song's lyrics and its final section with Wakeman's keyboards to be particularly strong. The song features choral passages performed by the Richard Williams Singers, whose musical arrangements were directed by Wakeman, and the Ars Laeta of Lausanne, recorded at the √âglise des Planches, a church in Montreux. An early version of the song's introduction was performed live during the band's final gig on the Relayer tour, in 1975.  Artwork  In addition to a change of producers and engineers, Going for the One also marked a departure in the band's choice of artwork design. Since 1971, they had worked with English artist Roger Dean who became known for his surreal and fantastical landscapes and designed their logo. While the band were recording, Dean had an idea for its sleeve he thought would suit the album which involved pieces of rock floating in the sky with the largest piece containing trees and a pool of water. It was intended to be a sequel design to his art on the band's first live album, Yessongs (1973).Yessongs: 40 Years On documentary at 32:18‚Äì32:58 However, when Dean flew to Montreux to pitch his idea, his idea was turned down. Dean recalled visiting the studio to find Anderson painting a cover of what he wanted and seemed uninterested in seeing his own design. In the end, he claimed he did not present his ideas to any other band member.Yessongs: 40 Years On documentary at 32:58‚Äì33:28 Howe claimed \\"a certain member\\" was no longer interested in working with Dean, which ended their collaboration until Drama (1980). The band commissioned Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis to design the artwork. They came up with a marked change in direction that represented a new, revitalised attitude within the band and their return to more direct and concise songs. Artist George Hardie contributed to the graphical design. Presented as a gatefold sleeve, the front cover depicts a standing nude male looking towards the Century Plaza Towers in Century City, California against a blue sky. Dean's logo designed for the band was retained and is credited in the liner notes. Inside features a photograph of each band member by Lake Geneva and Peilz Island, an island of a single tree also on the lake. Melody Maker reporter and band biographer Chris Welch later wrote about the cover: \\"Gone were the elaborate Roger Dean landscapes. In their place came stark, geometric simplicity. Anticipating computer designs of the future ... it symbolised a new look for Yes\\". Martin Popoff reviewed the design in 2016. \\"A new accelerated, late-'70s escapism through the clean lines of Hipgnosis, who combine slick, futuristic geometric urban angles with a man in his birthday suit, perhaps urgently propelling the band forward, while simultaneously embracing roots\\". Release Going for the One was released in the UK on 15 July 1977, available on LP, audio cassette, and 8-track tape. Its release was delayed after various problems were encountered with the pressing. It became a commercial success for the band, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart, their second album to do so following Tales from Topographic Oceans, for two weeks in August 1977 and peaking at number 8 on the US Billboard 200. Elsewhere, the album went to number 7 in Norway. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 2 August 1977 for selling over 500,000 copies in the US. In the UK, the album reached silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 19 September 1977, signifying 60,000 copies sold and sales worth over ¬£150,000.

The album spawned two singles, both released in 1977. \\"Wonderous Stories\\" was released with \\"Parallels\\" as the B-side which peaked at number 7 in the UK singles chart. To help promote the song, Yes filmed their first music video for the song which received airplay on the BBC television music show Top of the Pops. It remains the band's highest charting single in the country. The second, \\"Going for the One\\" with an edited version of \\"Awaken Pt. 1\\" on the B-side, reached number 24 in the UK. Reception In his review for Los Angeles Times, Steve Pond believed the album succeeds because the band had \\"lowered rather than raised its sights. By going back to basics rather than trying to top its previous 'extravaganzas', Yes has produced its most appealing collection\\" since Close to the Edge (1972). He praised the \\"refreshing energy\\" the album brings, but noted their \\"kitchen- sink approach to song-writing, throwing everything into a composition but sometimes failing to smoothly integrate the disparate elements\\". Doug Graves, in The Daily Tar Heel, welcome the band's return to more concise music with an album that is not as \\"grandiose and overproduced\\" as their previous two, and resembles the sound of The Yes Album and Fragile. He thought Wakeman plays his keyboard arrangements \\"with some taste\\" and praised Anderson's return to more abstract lyrics \\"rather than preachy\\". As a result, the band \\"made itself interesting again\\". The Independent published a more positive review by Tim Grobaty, who thought the album was the group's most accessible since Fragile and contains the best line-up. However, he deemed \\"Parallels\\" the \\"most boring and incoherent\\" track on the album, but the rest are \\"light and entertaining\\". Grobaty rates the title track and \\"Turn of the Century\\" as \\"excellent\\". Tony Ciarochi in Fairbanks Daily News-Miner wondered if Yes could return to better form after the poor Relayer, and believed they did, ranking the album as one of the band's better works. \\"Turn of the Century\\" was an \\"outstanding ballad\\" and \\"strangely beautiful\\", but is \\"unnecessarily long\\" which does become monotonous. Ciarochi picked out \\"Going for the One\\" and \\"Wonderous Stories\\" as standout tracks, though \\"Awaken\\" a mixture of good and tedious sections. A review from Chris Cobb for the Ottawa Journal thought the album is \\"typically ponderous and riddled with complexity\\" with vague lyrics. Cobb thought \\"Awaken ... stretches the band to the limits of its imagination\\" and contains \\"beautiful\\" organ playing from Wakeman, and concludes the album is at times too self-indulgent coupled with its abstract lyrics and meandering music \\"more than it should\\". In a retrospective review, biographer and reporter Chris Welch welcomed the album after the more complex material on Tales from Topographic Oceans and Relayer, citing its \\"melodic simplicity\\" which was \\"a breath of fresh air\\" and still stands up strong today. He praised Wakeman's performance and the band's choice in incorporating his talents into the music more effectively, which was not the case on Tales. He praised every track, calling \\"Wonderous Stories\\" a tune that allowed the group \\"to fly without really trying\\" and the closing moments of \\"Awaken\\", in particular, \\"quite beautiful ... the kind of music making now almost a lost art\\". Ross Boissoneau, for AllMusic, gave the album three stars out of five. He described Going for the One as \\"perhaps the most overlooked item in the Yes catalog ... In many ways, this disc could be seen as the follow-up to Fragile (1971). Its five tracks still retain mystical, abstract lyrical images, and the music is grand and melodic, the vocal harmonies perfectly balanced by the stinging guitar work of Steve Howe, Wakeman's keyboards, and the solid rhythms of Alan White and Chris Squire\\". He calls \\"Awaken\\" an \\"evocative track\\" with lyrics \\"spacey in the extreme\\", but praises Anderson and Squire's vocals and the addition of Anderson's harp and White's tuned percussion. Tour Yes supported Going for the One with its supporting concert tour across North America and Europe that ran from 30 July to 6 December 1977. Each show was opened by Donovan. It included a record six consecutive sold out nights at Wembley Arena in London that were attended by over 50,000 people. The tour included a more simple stage design, compared to their previous three tours which had featured large objects and scenery, with more emphasis on lighting. Wakeman's keyboards were arranged on two levels, and Anderson was illuminated in multiple colours as he sung \\"Colours of the Rainbow\\", a section of \\"The Beautiful Land\\" from the 1964 book and musical The Roar of the Greasepaint ‚Äì The Smell of the Crowd. Yes selected Going for the One for their first album- themed tour from March 2013 to June 2014, with the album performed live in its entirety the first time since 1977, and in track order. Reissues Going for the One was first reissued on CD across Europe in 1988. A digitally remastered CD followed in 1994 made by George Marino at Sterling Sound studios. In 2003, Rhino and Elektra Records released a new digitally remastered CD with seven bonus tracks. 2013 saw two remastered \\"audiophile\\" versions put out, one by Audio Fidelity for the Super Audio CD format and the other by Friday Music releasing a 180-gram LP using the original tapes.

A train of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway carrying about 160 passengers passed over the bridge as it failed. All but the lead locomotive plunged into the river. The train's oil lanterns and coal-fired heating stoves set the wooden cars alight. Rescuers pulled individuals from the wreck rather than extinguish the fire, and many who survived the crash burned to death. The accident killed approximately 92 people. It was the worst rail accident in the U.S. in the 19th century and the worst rail accident in U.S. history until the Great Train Wreck of 1918. The coroner's report found that the bridge, designed by the railroad company president, had been improperly designed, poorly constructed, and inadequately inspected. As a result of the accident, a hospital was built in the town and a federal system set up to formally investigate fatal railroad accidents. Design and construction of the bridge In 1863, officials of the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&A; one of the predecessors of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway), decided to replace the wooden bridge over the Ashtabula River just east of the village of Ashtabula, Ohio, with an iron structure. Amasa Stone was president of the CP&A.; His construction firm had built the CP&A; main line from 1850 to 1852, and Stone had purchased the patent rights to brother-in-law William Howe truss bridge in 1842. Stone resolved to construct a Howe truss bridge, a commonly used type of railroad bridge, and personally designed the new bridge. The longest span was long and above the river below. Stone also decided to award the contract for the ironwork to the Cleveland Rolling Mill (then known as Stone, Chisholm & Jones Company), an iron and steel company based in nearby Cleveland, Ohio, which was managed by his older brother, Andros Stone. The I-beams were made by the mill. The mill also provided raw iron to the CP&A;, which then made the cast and wrought iron elements according to the fabrication plans. Shop master mechanic Albert Congdon oversaw this latter work. Design Amasa Stone, the bridge's designer Amasa Stone's bridge was, by his own admission, experimental. He had constructed only one all-iron Howe truss bridge before, a high, long railroad bridge over the Ohio and Erie Canal in Cleveland. Joseph Tomlinson III, a well-known bridge builder and designer, was hired to flesh out Stone's design and create the fabrication drawings for all the bridge components. Tomlinson designed the bridge's lower chord to have a camber of . When the falsework supporting the bridge was removed and the dead load of the bridge came into play, the camber would drop to between . Tomlinson was alarmed when Stone demanded that the bridge be constructed completely of iron, rather than a combination of wood and iron. An all-iron bridge would have a much greater dead load, reducing the bridge's live load (its ability to carry trains). He also concluded that the beams and posts Stone intended to use were undersized. Tomlinson proposed riveting plates to the I-beams to strengthen them, but Stone angrily refused. Stone demanded that Tomlinson make the changes he required. Tomlinson refused, and was fired from the design effort. Stone then ordered the CP&A;'s chief engineer, Charles Collins, to make the desired changes to the bridge design. Collins refused, and was fired from the design effort. Stone himself then made the changes to the design. Stone then made additional changes to the design. In a Howe truss bridge, the vertical posts connect the upper and lower chords (main parallels) in the truss. The deck on which the train travels usually hangs from these posts; the greater the live load, the greater the tension on the posts. The bracing reacts in compression, counteracting the tension. Amasa Stone inverted this design so that only the upper chord (now at the bottom of the bridge) provided tension. Where diagonal braces did not receive the extra compression from a live load, inverted Howe truss bridges had a tendency to buckle where the vertical posts were attached to the deck with cast iron angle blocks. Stone's other major change involved the end panels. In the traditional Howe truss bridge, the end panel on each side of each end of the bridge has three vertical posts and three diagonal braces. Only five Howe truss bridges ever built by 1863 had just one vertical post and two diagonal braces in the end panels. These were known as \\"Single Howe\\" bridges. Amasa Stone used the \\"Single Howe\\" design for the end panels at Ashtabula. Thus, the bridge's entire structure relied on just 12 beams and posts (three at each end). Design of the angle blocks The chord, diagonals, angle blocks, and vertical posts of the Ashtabula Bridge, as drawn from original plans by Charles MacDonald in 1877 Gasparini and Fields claim that the exact design of the angle blocks and the ends (the \\"bearings\\") of the diagonals are lost to history. Civil engineer Charles MacDonald, who inspected the bridge's original plans in 1877, described and made drawings of part of the angle blocks. He noted that the vertical posts were made of iron pipe in diameter with a wall thick. Inside the pipe ran an iron rod thick. The top of the rod passed through the space between the members of the chord at the top of the bridge and then through a gib-plate. A nut and washer screwed onto the upper end of the rod, creating tension as well as securing the gib-plate in place. Those angle blocks at the top of the bridge had vertical, squarish lugs. Those members of the chord which ended atop an angle block had their bearings placed against the lug. These lugs served to transmit stress from the chord to the angle block and thence to the diagonals. These upper angle blocks also had lugs facing inward, to which were attached (by means MacDonald did not describe) the lateral braces. The interior side of each upper angle block also had a recess to accept a lug and a tap bolt. The tap bolt was used to connect the lug on the end of the sway rod to the angle block. MacDonald described (but did not publish a drawing of) the angle blocks at the bottom of the bridge. The bottom of the rod in the vertical posts screwed into these angle blocks. The members of the chord at the bottom of the bridge were flat bars, not I-beams, each bar measuring . Where a member of the chord ended at an angle block, a lug was forged at the base of the bar. This lug fit into a slot in the angle block. The angle blocks which made up the chord at the bottom of the bridge also had lugs facing inward, to which were attached (by means MacDonald did not describe) the lateral braces. MacDonald and Gasparini and Fields noted that the diagonal I-beams were designed to connect to both the upper and lower angle blocks with the flanges of the I-beam in a vertical position. The web of the I-beam fitted into a horizontal slot between two lugs. It is also known that, at the ends of the bridge, only half of each angle block received load because Stone used only a single diagonal in the end panel. This put enormous shear stress on the bridgeward side of these angle blocks. Construction One design for a half-angle block. The attached chord puts immense downward (shear) stress on one side of the block only, for which the block is not designed. The Ashtabula River bridge was erected in 1865 using Stone's design and plans and partly under his supervision. Tomlinson was the bridge's original construction supervisor, but at some point, before the construction of the bridge, Tomlinson turned in a letter of resignation after a number of heated arguments with Stone. However, to save face, Stone told the Ohio Legislative Committee, investigating the disaster, that he fired Tomlinson. Joseph Tomlinson was replaced by A. L. Rogers. When construction began, Tomlinson observed that the I-beams intended for use as diagonals were smaller than the fabrication plans called for. The amount of camber created a problem during construction. At Congdon's suggestion, Rogers built falsework to support construction of a bridge with a camber. Stone, now himself supervising Rogers' work, ordered the camber reduced to . With the members of the upper chord now too long, Rogers had the bearings shaved down. It is clear Rogers ordered other changes as well, but it is uncertain what these included. Gasparini and Fields suggest he also had the lugs atop the angle block planed down as well. When the falsework began to be removed, the dead load caused the bridge to bend about below horizontal. The bridge was jacked up and the falsework put back in place. Stone then ordered the chord members to be returned to their original lengths, restoring Tomlinson's intended camber. Rather than ordering new I-beams, Rogers used shims to close the space between the bearings and the lugs. When the falsework was removed a second time, the bridge buckled where the vertical posts connected to the deck. Several diagonals also buckled. Once more, the falsework went back in place. To correct this problem, Stone added more iron I-beams to the diagonals to strengthen them. The placement, size, and number of beams added is not clear, but Stone likely added two I-beams to the brace in the end panel, two I-beams to the brace in the first panel from the end, and one I-beam to the second panel from the end. This worsened the bridge's dead load problem. Collins, Congdon, Rogers, and Stone all later testified that the I-beams making up the diagonals were now turned 90 degrees, so that the flanges were horizontal. Congdon says that he realized the I-beams would carry more live load if they were rotated. Collins, Rogers, and Stone believed workers had installed the beams incorrectly (on their sides). To make the change, Stone had workers cut away portions of each diagonal I-beam's web at the bearing, enabling the web to fit over the lugs. This weakened the new diagonals. There is also some evidence that the angle blocks were damaged while the braces and counter-braces were rotated. The bridge was prestressed again. In every other panel connection, the diagonal braces were fitted to the angle blocks using shims rather than by tightening the vertical posts and putting the diagonals under compression. This meant that the shims carried the weight of a live load, rather than the braces themselves. It is also possible that the shims created uneven contact, causing angle blocks to undergo both bending and shear stress. Nevertheless, the bridge did not sag this time. Upon completion, the bridge was tested by having three locomotives run over the bridge at speed. A second test had the three engines stand still on the bridge. Deflection was minimal and the bridge rebounded satisfactorily. Bridge collapse and fire The iron bridge before collapse Blizzard conditions Train No. 5 of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, known as The Pacific Express, left Buffalo, New York, at 2 PM on December 29, 1876, 1 hour and 8 minutes behind schedule. A powerful blizzard began hitting northern Ohio, northeast Pennsylvania, and eastern New York two days earlier. More than of snow had already fallen, and winds were creating heavy snowdrifts on the railroad tracks deep in places. The snow was so heavy that, shortly after leaving Buffalo, a second engine was added to help pull the train. The train left Erie, Pennsylvania, at 5:01 PM, an hour and 16 minutes behind schedule. Its two locomotives, Socrates and Columbia, were hauling two baggage cars, two day passenger coaches, two express coaches, a drawing room car (the \\"Yokohama\\"), three sleeper cars (the \\"Palatine\\", which originated in New York City and was bound for Chicago; the \\"City of Buffalo\\", which originated in Boston and was bound for Chicago; and the \\"Osceo\\", a sleeper for passengers going to St. Louis), and a smoking car with about 150 to 200 passengers and 19 crew aboard. Two additional locomotives were needed to push the train away from the station due to the heavy snow. Initial collapse and survival of the \\"Socrates\\" Ashtabula Bridge collapse. The No. 5 was due to arrive in Cleveland at 7:05 PM, but at about 7:30 PM it was just reaching Ashtabula‚Äîan hour and 53 minutes behind schedule. About half an hour earlier, the No. 8 passenger train of the LS&MS; passed over the Ashtabula River bridge without incident, heading east. The bridge over the Ashtabula River was about east of the Ashtabula station, and the locomotives shut off their steam (cutting off power to the drive) about east of the bridge to allow the train to glide into the station. As the Pacific Express crossed the bridge, it was doing (according to the locomotive engineers). Visibility was practically nonexistent, at most one or two car lengths. As the \\"Socrates\\" neared the western abutment, engineer Daniel McGuire heard a crack and felt his locomotive drop slowly downward. Realizing the bridge was collapsing beneath him, he opened the throttle to maximum. The \\"Socrates\\" lurched ahead, just as the weight of the 11 cars began to pull on the \\"Columbia\\" behind it. The connection between the two locomotives snapped, enabling the \\"Socrates\\" to make it off the bridge. The rear trucks on his tender hung in the air, but the forward movement of the \\"Socrates\\" pulled the tender forward and it regained the rails and solid ground. McGuire brought the \\"Socrates\\" to a halt about down the track, and began repeatedly sounding his whistle and ringing the train bell in alarm. Collapse of the remaining bridge Postcard photo of the wreck. The view is toward the west abutment; the locomotive \\"Columbia\\" can be seen in the wreckage at left. The \\"Columbia\\" and the 11 cars behind it acted like a linked chain load. The bridge's collapse was therefore not sudden, but rather somewhat slow and piecemeal. The \\"Columbia\\" struck the abutment, the engine supported by the stonework while the tender hung downward toward the river valley. The first express car fell into the ravine, crashing nose-first into the ground at the base of the abutment. The \\"Columbia\\" slipped backward off the abutment, landing upside-down and backward atop the first express car. It then fell onto its side, its trucks pointing north. The second express car and the two baggage cars landed largely upright, slightly south of the bridge. The second baggage car was slightly askew, its nose resting against the western abutment and its rear pointing southeast. Most of the bridge's upper chord (the bottom of the bridge) crashed to the ground north of the bridge. The lower chord (at the top of the bridge) and what remained of the deck held for a moment, then fell directly down to land atop the locomotive, express cars, and baggage cars. Momentum pulled the rest of the train into the space where the bridge used to be. The first passenger coach landed upright in mid-stream atop the wreckage of the bridge and the second express car. The second passenger car twisted in the air as it fell, landing on its side atop the bridge and first baggage car. The smoking car, having broken free of the passenger coach ahead of it, moved more freely. It struck the forward part of the second passenger coach, crushing it, before being propelled into the first passenger coach. (It is widely believed most people in the first passenger coach died when the smoking car fell on them.) Momentum also carried the parlor car \\"Yokohama\\" and the three sleeper cars into the chasm. All of them landed about south of the bridge. The \\"Yokohama\\" landed upright in mid-stream, and the sleeper \\"Palatine\\" landed mostly right-side up beside it to the north. The sleeper \\"City of Buffalo\\" then nose-dived into the rear of the \\"Palatine\\", partially crushing it and killing several people. It continued through the \\"Palatine\\" into the rear of the \\"Yokohama\\", pushing the parlor car onto its side. The \\"Buffalo\\" smashed forward along the length of the parlor car, likely killing everyone inside. The rear of the \\"Buffalo\\" lay atop the \\"Palatine\\", high in the air. An eyewitness said no one in the \\"City of Buffalo\\" survived the crash. The final sleeper, the \\"Osceo\\", landed on the east bank of the river, mostly upright. Fire and deaths 1878 drawing based on a January 1877 photograph of the ruins of the bridge The \\"New Bridge\\" built after the catastrophe The Ashtabula Train Bridge Disaster Site in 2015 The crash was heard at the railroad's W. 32nd Street Station (just to the west of the bridge) and in the town, and the alarm was raised. Rescuers first on the scene included railroad employees, those waiting on the platform at the station, and residents of Ashtabula who lived near the bridge. The only access to the valley floor was a set of steep, narrow steps, covered in snow. Most people slid down the steep incline rather than take the steps, and several people brought axes to help free survivors. The wooden cars burst into flame when their coal- and kerosene-fed heating stoves and oil lamps overturned. An early report said fire broke out in the \\"Osceo\\" and in at least three other places, and within a minute the entire wreck was ablaze. Historian Darrell E. Hamilton says the fire broke out at either end, and moved toward the middle. According to rear brakeman A.H. Stone, those still left alive in the wreckage were dead within 20 minutes. By the time rescuers reached the bridge, many wounded passengers had already made their way to the shore and the fire was burning fiercely. The response by the Ashtabula Fire Brigade was minimal. G.W. Knapp, the city's fire chief, was an alcoholic who even when sober was slow to make decisions and easily confused. The Lake Erie Hose Company's hand-pumped and steam-pumped horse-drawn fire engines arrived first, but Knapp never gave any orders to fight the flames. He told a bystander that there was no use in fighting the fire, even though it was plain that some survivors were still trapped in the wreck. Railroad employees also told Knapp that his firefighters should get the wounded out and clear a pathway up the side of the ravine. At least one member of the town begged Knapp to put water on the flames, but he refused. Instead, the townspeople secured buckets and (with the help of some members of the fire brigade) tried to put out the blaze. The Protection Fire Company's hand-pumped engine and the Neptune Hose Company's steam-pumper (both horse-drawn) were hauled more than a mile through town to the bridge, but arrived too late to stop the spread of the fire. The darkness and blinding snow made it difficult for surviving passengers to orient themselves and get out of the wreck. A number of passengers drowned in the river, while others escaped the blaze only to die of smoke inhalation. The injured and dying were either carried up the steep steps or hauled up the incline on sleds or sleighs pulled up by rope. There was no hospital in Ashtabula. The injured were first taken to the railroad engine house, to the filthy and run-down Eagle Hotel adjacent to the station, or to the nearby Ashtabula House hotel. As these places filled, residents opened their homes to the survivors. Ambulatory injured were the last to be hauled up from the valley. By midnight, all the survivors had reached safety. The 10 doctors in the village attended to the wounded. About 1 AM, a special train arrived from Cleveland carrying railroad officials and five more surgeons. Unfortunately, thieves moved among the dead and wounded, stealing money and valuables. A large crowd of the curious gathered at the wreck site the next morning, and some in the crowd looted the train until Ashtabula's mayor, H. P. Hepburn, stationed a guard at the site. Some of the money and valuables were discovered following investigations by local police, and a few arrests made. Hepburn later issued a proclamation promising amnesty for anyone else who turned over stolen items. Money and valuables worth about $1,500 ($ in dollars) were collected, but most of the stolen money and goods were never recovered. The number of people killed in the Ashtabula bridge disaster will never be known. The number could be as high as 200, although the official count is 83 dead. Another 64 people were injured. The number of deaths is inexact, in part because the number of passengers on the train is difficult to estimate and in part because many remains were partial (a hand, a leg, a torso). Most (although not all) remains recovered from the wreck were burned beyond recognition and could not be identified from clothing or personal items. An unknown number of the dead were essentially cremated in the blaze. Among the dead was hymn writer Philip Bliss. Identifying and burying the dead Identification of the dead took a week or more. There were full or partial remains of about 36 bodies in the railroad freight house, with concerned families encouraged to come by and try to identify corpses. For several days after the wreck, townspeople and railroad employees used their hands and feet, hoes, rakes, and shovels to dig through the ash, ice, mud, and snow to find any personal items they could. These items‚Äîwhich included partially burned train tickets, diaries, photographs, watches, jewelry, unique or rare items of clothing, or keepsakes‚Äîwere kept by the railroad. When a corpse could not be identified, grieving families sometimes were able to use these \\"relics\\" to confirm that a loved one had been aboard the train. Even so, identifying objects or papers often were separated from remains, and misidentification of remains was common. Concerned friends and family members sent letters and telegrams in the hundreds to railroad and civic authorities, seeking knowledge of their loved ones. These contained descriptions of the alleged passenger, as well as any identifying personal effects. Some of these letters were fraudulent, sent by people seeking gold watches, jewelry, or other items as \\"loot\\". Fraudulent letters tended to be spotted fairly easily, and were not answered. Wreck investigators were still turning up remains as late as mid-January. A burial service for the unidentified dead was held at Ashtabula's Chestnut Grove Cemetery on January 19, 1877. A mile-long procession conveyed the dead to the cemetery. The railroad purchased a burial plot in which 18 coffins, containing the remains of an estimated 22 people, where placed. Three coffins with three corpses remained at the freight house in the hope that they could still be identified. When these remains went unclaimed, they were buried about a week later in the same plot at Chestnut Grove. Investigation Charles Collins, the railroad's chief engineer of bridges At dawn on December 30, Ashtabula resident Fred W. Blakeslee took photos of the wrecked bridge and train. These provide the most extensive documentation of the wreck known as of 2003. Three investigations were made into the disaster. Conclusions by the coroner's jury There being no coroner in Ashtabula, a coroner's jury of six men from the town was convened by Justice of the Peace Edward W. Richards on December 31. The jury took testimony from 20 railroad officials and employees (including both locomotive engineers and the rear brakeman), nine members of the Ashtabula fire department, 10 residents of Ashtabula, six passengers, and eight civil engineers and bridge builders. The coroner's jury submitted its report on March 8, 1877. The coroner's jury blamed the collapse of the Ashtabula River bridge and the deaths by fire on five factors: #The bridge was poorly designed. An all-iron Howe truss was unsuitable for such a long bridge. Some of the members of the chords and braces were not designed to be of sufficient strength, and were poorly placed. The lateral cross-bracing was so underdesigned as to be of little value. The angle blocks had too few and poorly designed lugs, which did not keep the braces and counter-braces from slipping out of place. #The bridge was poorly constructed. Each member of the bridge acted independently instead of being positively connected to its neighbors. Some of the vertical posts, braces, and cross-braces were put in the wrong places. To accommodate design changes during the bridge's strengthening, the lugs on the angle blocks and the flanges on the I-beams of the chords were cut away in part, reducing their strength and effectiveness. The construction of the yokes used to bind the braces and counter-braces was poor, and shims were used to compensate for chord members which were too short. The modifications made to the bridge before its completion used thick members where thin ones were required, and thin ones where thick ones should have been used. #Railroad bridge inspectors did not perform their jobs adequately. Inspectors should have noted the severe deficiencies in the bridge's design and construction, and did not. They also should have observed problems with members becoming loose over time. #The railroad failed to use self-extinguishing heating stoves, as required by state law passed on May 4, 1869. #The fire was worsened by the failure of those on the scene to attempt to douse the flames. The Lake Erie Hose Company's hand pump and steam pump, first on the scene, could have saved lives. The Neptune Hose Company's steam pump and the Protection Fire Company's hand pump were hauled more than through snowdrifts, but arrived too late. Amasa Stone was held personally responsible for the bridge's poor design, and the railroad company for the lax inspection of the bridge and the failure to use self-extinguishing heating apparatus. G.W. Knapp was held personally responsible for failing to fight the fire in a timely fashion. Conclusions by the state legislative joint committee Sketch of the Ashtabula Bridge wreckage On January 1, 1877, the Ohio General Assembly adopted a joint resolution appointing a committee to investigate the causes of the Ashtabula River bridge collapse, and to make recommendations to the legislature. The committee consisted of five members of the Ohio House of Representatives and three members of the Ohio Senate. Senator A.M. Burns chaired the committee. The joint committee hired three civil engineers (Benjamin F. Bowen, John Graham, and Thomas H. Johnson) to examine the wreckage and report to the committee regarding the bridge's design and performance. The committee also received written reports from civil engineers Albert S. Howland and W.S. Williams, and took personal testimony from civil engineer M.J. Becker and from railroad officials and employees Amasa Stone, Charles Collins, Albert Congdon, A.L. Rogers, and Gustavus Folsom (engineer of the \\"Columbia\\"). Technical advice was provided by civil engineers D.W. Caldwell and J.E. Wright. The coroner's jury granted the joint committee full access to all of its testimony and reports as well. In appendices to its report, the joint committee printed in full the coroner's jury testimony of civil engineers A. Gottlieb, John D. Crehore, and Joseph Tomlinson. The legislative joint committee issued its report on January 30, 1877. The committee blamed the collapse of the Ashtabula River bridge on three factors: #The bridge's design was flawed. Nothing in the design prevented the lateral buckling of the braces or the upper chord. Only a part of the upper chord was designed to transmit load to the angle blocks, and the lugs on the angle blocks were poorly designed (so that strain could not be fully transmitted to the braces and counter-braces). The bridge was apparently designed for a non- moving live load, and little evidence existed to show it was designed to accommodate jarring, oscillation, vibration, or the force of wind. #There were significant errors in construction. The members making up the braces were not connected to act in unison, greatly reducing the bridge's ability to carry a live load. In the lower chord, lateral braces were placed only at every other panel connection, extended across two panels (not one), and were not connected to one another where they crossed. The sway braces were too small to prevent sway, and placed only at every other panel as well. Neither the braces nor counter-braces were attached to the angle blocks, and their ends were not square. #The defects in design and construction could have been identified by careful inspection at any time, but the railroad's inspectors did not identify these problems. Many braces and counter-braces had fallen out of position before the bridge collapsed, something inspectors either did not notice or the railroad did not repair. The committee found no defects in materials, and rejected the idea that application of the air brakes by the second locomotive caused the bridge to collapse. Conclusions of the MacDonald investigation A third investigation was conducted independently by civil engineer Charles MacDonald, who likely was commissioned to study the bridge's collapse by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). MacDonald blamed three factors for the bridge's failure: #Improper inspection by railroad officials. He noted, however, that the LS&MS; was not alone in infrequent inspection by largely untrained men. #An inadequate knowledge of the strength of iron. The whole industry suffered from a lack of this knowledge, he wrote. #The failure of a mis-cast lug. MacDonald believed the bridge collapsed due to a flaw in southernmost lug at the top of the first full angle block from the west end. He noted that the lugs atop the angle blocks on the bridge had, for some reason, been shaved down to from . This significantly weakened the ability of the lugs to transmit stress from the chord to the braces and counter-braces. According to his report, \\"The cast iron angle block at top of second set of braces had the south lug broken off close to the face, and the line of fracture disclosed an air hole extending over one half the entire section. ...[The] failure first began in the south truss, at the second panel point from the west abutment.\\" The second full angle block \\"was so far impaired by an air hole as to be reduced in strength fully one half. ... At no other point were these lugs subjected to so great strain, except at the end casting and here they were heavily reinforced.\\" This \\"defective detail\\" caused the collapse of the bridge. Conclusions by the railroad LS&MS; president Amasa Stone categorically denied that there were any design or construction flaws. He initially blamed the bridge's collapse on the derailment of one of the two locomotives pulling the train, or by a loose rail which caused the train's derailment. The railroad also hypothesized that a tornado may have hit the bridge, causing it to come loose from the abutments. Although the LS&MS; refused to accept responsibility for the disaster, it paid out more than $500,000 ($ in dollars) to victims and their families to quiet legal claims. Modern engineering analysis of the disaster Bj√∂rn √Ökesson, a civil engineer at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, has identified three proximate causes of the bridge collapse: (1) the failure of an angle block lug on the west end of the bridge due to fatigue (caused by bending and shear stress), (2) thrust stress from improperly fitting chords and diagonals, and (3) low temperatures, which caused the cast iron angle blocks to become brittle. The failure of the angle block caused the upper chord to buckle, and the bridge to collapse. The angle block The angle blocks were made of cast iron, which √Ökesson says was appropriate, for the angle blocks were in compression. The vertical lugs atop the angle blocks in the upper chord of the bridge received shear stress, but this should have been minimal as shear stress was only induced by one of the adjacent members of the chord. The critical issue, √Ökesson says, is that the broken lug on the southern angle block atop the joint between the second and third panel had a void. The void itself weakened the integrity of the block. Voids also encourage the formation of large grains and can accumulate impurities like slag, both of which also increase the brittleness of iron. The void also worsened stress on the block through stress concentration effect. Gasparini and Fields conclude that this void, combined with metal fatigue, caused the lug to fail. Metal fatigue was an issue in cast and wrought iron which only a few metallurgists and engineers were aware of in the 19th century. The failure of this lug on this angle block caused the entire bridge to fail. Neither the joint committee, nor the coroner's jury, nor any of the engineers employed by them identified the flaw in the angle block casting. In retrospect, Gasparini and Fields say, the point where the lug transitioned to the main body of the angle block was extremely problematic. The solidification rates of the molten iron were so different, this was a likely site for the formation of cracks or voids. Poor construction caused overwhelming thrust load Poor construction of the bridge's diagonals worsened the stresses placed on the lugs on the angle blocks. Howe trusses rely on prestressing of braces and counter-braces to improve the way the bridge carries load. Tightening the nuts on the vertical posts (prestressing) puts the verticals in tension (stretches them). If the diagonals are already closely fitted to the angle blocks, prestressing compresses the diagonals. This allows them to carry more load. The Ashtabula Bridge diagonals, however, were only loosely fitted to the angle blocks. Prestressing brought the diagonals into a relatively close fit with the angle blocks, but did not put the diagonals in compression. The problem was worsened because shims were used to fill the space between the diagonal bearings and the angle blocks. The history of the bridge indicates that some of these shims had come loose over time and fallen away. The loss of shims induced uneven loading, as the more tightly-connected diagonals absorbed load before the loose ones did. √Ökesson points out that the shims themselves may even have created unequal pressure points between I-beams and the lugs, subjecting the lugs to bending forces as well as shear forces. With the diagonals not carrying the load they were intended to carry, extra stress was placed on the chords. Unequal loading of the angle blocks worsened the metal fatigue. The construction of the upper chord of the bridge was also poor. This chord consisted of five I-beams running in parallel. Having all five members end at panel joints actually weakened a bridge, so Howe trusses were built so that three ended at one panel connection and the other two at the next panel connection. As with the connection between diagonals and angle blocks, it was critical that there be no space between the I-beams and the lugs on top of the angle block because these lugs transferred axial forces to the next member. Space between the member and lug would reduce the effectiveness of this transfer and introduce shear stress to the lug. The problems with camber led to members of the chords being shortened and the lugs being shaved down, actions which introduced space between the lugs and the chord members. Construction workers used metal shims to fill the space between the lug and the chord members until a tight fit was achieved. Friction alone, rather than an active connection such as a yoke or bolt, kept the shims in place. For some years prior to the disaster, locomotive engineers reported hearing \\"snapping sounds\\" as their trains crossed the Ashtabula Bridge. This indicates that some shims had come loose and fallen off, reintroducing space between the chord members and angle block vertical lugs. This allowed members of the chord to thrust suddenly against the lugs, inducing even more metal fatigue. There is also an indication in the construction record that several chord members were misaligned. Even if their bearings had been flat, they would not have met the lugs completely. This, too, would have created uneven loading and worsened metal fatigue. Gasparini and Fields conclude that the bridge might have survived the loss of the lug had the chords and diagonals been made stronger through active continuous connection. Active continuous connection was not used on the bridge: The members of the chords were connected to angle blocks at only every other panel, the five beams making up each chord did not have a continuous interconnection between them, and the none of the parallel I-beams making up the diagonals were continuously interconnected. √Ökesson points out that construction errors probably made the diagonals even less effective as thin members were placed where thicker ones should have gone and vice versa. The braces and counter-braces in a Howe truss must be the same size for the truss system to be robust and redundant. Making a brace stronger relative to a counter-brace, for example, actually reduces robustness and redundancy by changing the relative distribution of forces on the diagonals. These errors appreciably lessened the bridge's ability to withstand extra loading. Stone's strengthening of the bridge after the camber repairs also harmed the bridge's capabilities. By adding two I-beams to the end braces, Stone actually reduced the maximum stress the braces in the end panels could bear. Low temperature exacerbated the flaw in the lug Low temperatures the night of the disaster also worsened the metal fatigue in the already damaged lug. The role which low temperatures played in creating and worsening metal fatigue was also poorly understood in the 19th century. The temperature at the time of the accident was . Cast iron is prone to fracture and fatigue cracks, and Gasparini and Fields suggest that a significant fatigue crack, originating at the void in the lug, existed at the time of the disaster, created by repeated unequal stress over the previous 11 years. The low temperatures on the night of the accident increased the brittleness of the cast iron. An existing fracture worsened in the cold and likely caused the lug's failure. The issue of poor inspection Modern analyses of the bridge collapse conclude that the railway had inadequately inspected and maintained the bridge. √Ökesson, however, says that better inspection of the bridge may not have prevented a collapse. An inverted Howe truss puts the superstructure below the track, where it is difficult to see and inspect, and the angle blocks were hidden by the surrounding I-beams. Better inspection may have corrected some construction errors and identified falling shims, but might not have improved the bridge's survivability. Legacy Ohio historical marker near the site of the wreck The legislative joint committee drafted a bill that would have created Ohio's first bridge design code, required professional oversight of bridge construction, and mandated expert, frequent, regular inspections by civil engineers. The Ohio state legislature declined to act on the bill. Concern that the city lacked medical care for the victims of the bridge disaster, citizens of Ashtabula began raising money to build a hospital in their town. An emergency care clinic opened in 1882, followed by Ashtabula General Hospital on July 1, 1904. Several other changes were also made in the wake of the accident. Because of its low ductility, cast iron was banned by civil engineers for use in load-carrying structures soon after the accident. About 1886, steam heat was adopted by the railroad, replacing the wood and coal stoves in passenger cars. As part of the Interstate Commerce Act, a federal system was set up in 1887 to formally investigate fatal railroad accidents. Initially, the mass grave of unidentified remains in Chestnut Grove Cemetery was unmarked. Local citizens began an effort to erect a monument on the site in 1892, and the Ashtabula Bridge Disaster Monument was dedicated on May 30, 1895, before a crowd of 5,000 people. The names of 25 individuals known to have died in the fire but whose remains could not be found are listed on a plaque on the memorial's base. The alarm bell from the Lake Street Fire House which was used to call for help on the night of December 29 has also been preserved. It passed into private hands, but was donated to the city of Ashtabula in 1975. It is now on display in front of the city's Main Avenue fire station, accompanied by a small plaque. Letters from concerned friends and families seeking whether loved ones had survived are archived at the Jennie Munger Gregory Memorial Museum at Geneva-on-the-Lake, Ohio. A newspaper report on Engineer Collins death Death of Charles Collins Days after testifying before the state legislature committee, LS&MS; chief engineer Charles Collins was found dead in his bedroom of a gunshot wound to the head. Having tendered his resignation to the railroad's board of directors the previous Monday and been refused, Collins was believed to have committed suicide out of grief and feeling partially responsible for the tragic accident. Two official autopsies were conducted in 1878. Both concluded that Collins had been murdered. For unknown reasons, law enforcement officials did not release these reports at the time. In 2011, Len Brown, the producer and director of the documentary film \\"Engineering Tragedy: The Ashtabula Train Disaster\\" contacted the Cleveland Police archives department, to see the original investigative report filed by Capt. Henry M. Holzworth: Detective Cleveland Police in 1877 who investigated the scene. Unfortunately, the records were destroyed during a flood in the 1970s and were not saved. Collins was buried in an elaborate mausoleum at Chestnut Grove Cemetery. Amasa Stone died May 11, 1883.

He was a virtuoso falsettist, and one of the most enthusiastic composers of the new style of monody. Life Nothing is known about his early life; his birthdate is inferred from the description by an English visitor in 1608 who described him as being \\"about forty.\\" The first record concerning him is from 1593, when he was employed as an alto in Loreto at Santa Casa. Until 1602 he was in Urbino, where he served both Monsignor Giuliano della Rovere and the Duke of Urbino. From 1602 to 1605 he worked as organist at Pesaro Cathedral, and afterwards worked in Padua for the Bishop of Padua. In 1608 he went to Venice to take part in the Festival of San Rocco. Evidently his fame as a singer was widespread at this time, as he was one of the most distinguished visitors. An English visitor to Venice, Thomas Coryat, left this description of his singing (Coryats Crudities, London, 1611): :\\"Of the singers there were three or foure so excellent that I thinke few or none in Christendome do exell them, especially one, who had such a peerelesse and ... supernaturall voice for sweetnesse, that I thinke there was never a better singer in the world ... I alwaies thought that he was an Eunuch, which if he had beene, it had taken away some part of my admiration, because they do most commonly sing passing wel; but he was not, therefore it was much the more admirable.\\" In the preface to one of his books of motets, Barbarino wrote that he would sing his works to the accompaniment of the chitarrone, \\"for my voice is hoarse and frail.\\" Works Almost all of Barbarino's music is in the monodic style, using a single virtuoso solo voice part accompanied by basso continuo. Unusually for the time, he often indicated the instruments which were best to use as accompaniment, including chitarrone, theorbo, and harpsichord. His last collection of works, a book of madrigals dated to 1617, is for three voices, but also accompanied by basso continuo. Barbarino published two books of motets, both in Venice, as well as thirteen separate sacred pieces; additionally he published five books of madrigals and one book of canzonette, for a total of over 150 pieces. He often published two separate versions of the solo voice part for each work: one heavily ornamented and extremely difficult to sing (most likely he sang this version himself); and a simplified version intended for a less accomplished singer.

Ancestry and progeny Garc√≠a was born in Holgu√≠n to parents of Cuban Criollo descent. He was a large, strong, educated man with a short fuse. Garc√≠a was the grandson of Calixto Garc√≠a de Luna e Izquierdo, who had fought as royalist in the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 during Venezuelan War of Independence. His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a cacique from Valencia, Venezuela. His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic \\"de Luna\\" upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837 for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman). A number of his sons, most notable Carlos Garc√≠a Velez and Calixto Enamorado, fought in his armies. War record Around the age of 18, taking after his grandfather, Garc√≠a joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence (Ten Years' War). Garc√≠a fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture. Far from his troops, protected only by a small detail who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia, in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of seizing him, shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound left a great scar and gave him headaches for the rest of his life. When the Spanish authorities came to Holgu√≠n to inform Calixto's mother, Luc√≠a I√±√≠guez, she said that he was not her son. When the officials explained to her Calixto tried to commit suicide, she replied that he was her son, \\"better dead than captured!\\" He was imprisoned until the Pact of Zanj√≥n ending the Ten Years' War was signed in 1878. Garc√≠a travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, Garc√≠a joined with Antonio Maceo Grajales in the Little War from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 War for Independence. He, and at least three sons, separately escaped Spain and arrived with a well-supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the Ten Years' War, as the second in command in the Cuban Army. Garc√≠a with American brigadier general William Ludlow at the time of the landing of the American army in Cuba Garcia had a long string of victories in this war, which included the taking of Tunas and Guisa, and the emotionally significant re-occupation of Bayamo. Garc√≠a made liberal use of spies to prepare for his attacks. These include Dominador de la Guardia father of √Ångel de la Guardia and Mar√≠a Machado, illegitimate daughter of Spanish General Emilio March who helped prepare the taking of Tunas; Frederick Funston later US Major General and Jos√© Mart√≠ y Zayas Baz√°n son of Jos√© Mart√≠ the major Cuban National Hero directed artillery; Mario Garc√≠a Menocal a to-be president of Cuba who was wounded in a principal assault. Angel de la Guardia, also a major Cuban national hero, died in this battle on August 30, 1897. At the time of the U.S. landings, Garc√≠a, with skilled use of mobile artillery, controlled the interior of old Oriente Province, and prepared the landing places for the U.S. Army near Santiago. His troops effectively supported the Marine forces at Guantanamo who, once out of range of the guns of the , had difficulty dealing with Spanish guerrilla tactics. He was the general who dealt with the American troops and joined them in military actions, only to be denied entrance into Santiago de Cuba when the Spanish surrendered. Death Garc√≠a died of pneumonia at age 59 on December 11, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing warship to Cuba. His final burial in Cuba was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba. A major statue is found on the Malec√≥n near the US Interests Section in Havana. After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase \\"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\\" was erected by the Freemasons at the place of his demise‚Äîthe Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of Garc√≠a's direct descendants. The essay \\"A Message to Garcia\\" by Elbert Hubbard was written in reference to U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Rowan's successful mission, against great odds, to establish contact with Garc√≠a early in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, \\"to take a message to Garc√≠a\\", meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent A Message to Garcia with Garc√≠a played by Charles Sutton and the 1936 film A Message to Garcia featuring Enrique Acosta. In 1976 a municipality in Holgu√≠n Province was named Calixto Garc√≠a after him. His portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote. Print sources * Castellano Garc√≠a, Gerardo 1927.

It is named for Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, who sailed along the ice front as far as 68¬∞10' South during December 1893. In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast. From north to south, the segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, and Larsen C (the largest) by researchers who work in the area. Further south, Larsen D and the much smaller Larsen E, F and G are also named. The breakup of the ice shelf since the mid-1990s has been widely reported, with the collapse of Larsen B in 2002 being particularly dramatic. A large section of the Larsen C shelf broke away in July 2017 to form an iceberg known as A-68. The ice shelf originally covered an area of , but following the disintegration in the north and the break away of iceberg A-17, it now covers an area of . Ice shelf Processes around an Antarctic ice shelf The collapse of Larsen B has revealed a thriving chemotrophic ecosystem 800 m (half a mile) below the sea. The discovery was accidental. U.S. Antarctic Program scientists were in the north-western Weddell Sea investigating the sediment record in a deep glacial trough of roughly (twice the size of Texas or France). Methane and hydrogen sulfide associated with cold seeps is suspected as the source of the chemical energy powering the ecosystem. The area had been protected by the overlying ice shelf from debris and sediment which was seen to be building up on the white microbial mats after the breakup of the ice shelf. Clams were observed clustered about the vents. The former Larsen A region, which was the farthest north and was just outside the Antarctic Circle, had previously broken up in the middle of the present interglacial and reformed only about 4,000 years ago. The former Larsen B, by contrast, had been stable for at least 10,000 years. The ice of the shelf is renewed on a much shorter time-scale and the oldest ice on the current shelf dates from only two hundred years ago. The speed of Crane Glacier increased threefold after the collapse of the Larsen B, likely due to the removal of a buttressing effect of the ice shelf. Data collected in 2007 by an international team of investigators through satellite-based radar measurements suggests that the overall ice-sheet mass balance in Antarctica is increasingly negative.Perlman, David (2008) \\"Antarctic Glaciers Melting More Quickly\\" San Francisco Chronicle (26 January) p. A2, online Breakup An image of the collapsing Larsen B Ice Shelf and a comparison of this to the U.S. state of Rhode Island. The Larsen disintegration events were unusual by past standards. Typically, ice shelves lose mass by iceberg calving and by melting at their upper and lower surfaces. The disintegration events were linked by The Independent newspaper in 2005 to ongoing climate warming in the Antarctic Peninsula, about 0.5ÀöC (0.9ÀöF) per decade since the late 1940s.Connor, Steve (2005) \\"Ice shelf collapse was biggest for 10,000 years since Ice Age\\" The Independent, London (4 August), online According to a paper published in Journal of Climate in 2006, the peninsula at Faraday station warmed by 2.94ÀöC (5.3ÀöF) from 1951 to 2004, much faster than Antarctica as a whole and faster than the global trend; anthropogenic global warming causes this localized warming through a strengthening of the winds circling the Antarctic. Larsen A The Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated in January 1995. Larsen B The collapse of Larsen B, showing the diminishing extent of the shelf from 1998 to 2002. From 31 January 2002 to March 2002 the Larsen B sector partially collapsed and parts broke up, of ice thick, an area comparable to the US state of Rhode Island. In 2015, a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf will disintegrate by 2020, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area. Larsen B was stable for at least 10,000 years, essentially the entire Holocene period since the last glacial period. By contrast, Larsen A was absent for a significant part of that period, reforming about 4,000 years ago. Despite its great age, the Larsen B was clearly in trouble at the time of the collapse. With warm currents eating away the underside of the shelf, it had become a \\"hotspot of global warming\\". It broke in a time of three weeks or less, with a factor in this fast break-up being the powerful effects of water; ponds of meltwater formed on the surface during the near 24 hours of daylight in the summertime, then the water flowed down into cracks and, acting like a multitude of wedges, levered the shelf apart. Other likely factors in the break-up were the higher ocean temperatures and the decline of the ice of the peninsula. Larsen C 2016 rift in Larsen C, wide view Glacier-ice shelf interactions.

In 2004, a report concluded that although the remaining Larsen C region appeared to be relatively stable,Riedl C, Rott H, Rack W (2004) \\"Recent Variations of Larsen Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, Observed by Envisat\\" Proceedings of the 2004 Envisat & ERS Symposium, Salzburg, Austria, online continued warming could lead to its breakup within the following decade.Rignot, Eric (2007) \\"Mass Balance and Ice Dynamics of Antarctic Peninsula Glaciers for IPY2007-2008\\" Proposal #359, International Polar Year Expression of Intent. The breakaway process for the iceberg had begun by mid-2016. On 10 November 2016 scientists photographed the growing rift running along the Larsen C ice shelf, showing it running about long with a width of more than , and a depth of . By December 2016, the rift had extended another to the point where only of unbroken ice remained and calving was considered to be a certainty in 2017. This was predicted to cause the calving of between nine and twelve percent of the ice shelf, , an area greater than the US state of Delaware, or twice the size of Luxembourg. The calved fragment was predicted to be thick and to have an area of about . The resulting iceberg was predicted to be among the largest icebergs ever recorded, unless it would break into multiple pieces. On 1 May 2017 members of MIDAS reported that satellite images showed a new crack, around long, branching off the main crack approximately behind the previous tip, heading toward the ice front. Scientists with Swansea University in the UK say the crack lengthened from 25 May to 31 May, and that less than of ice is all that prevents the birth of an enormous iceberg. \\"The rift tip appears also to have turned significantly towards the ice front, indicating that the time of calving is probably very close,\\" Adrian Luckman and Martin O'Leary wrote on Wednesday in a blog post for the Impact of Melt on Ice Shelf Dynamics and Stability project, or MIDAS. \\"There appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely.\\" The larger swath of the Larsen C ice shelf that sat behind the calved iceberg \\"will be less stable than it was prior to the rift\\" and may rapidly disintegrate in the same manner as Larsen B did in 2002. In June 2017 the speed of the imminent Larsen C iceberg accelerated, with the eastern end moving at per day away from the main shelf. As discussed by the Project MIDAS researchers on their site: \\"In another sign that the iceberg calving is imminent, the soon-to-be-iceberg part of Larsen C ice shelf has tripled in speed to more than 10 meters per day between 24 and 27 June 2017. The iceberg remains attached to the ice shelf, but its outer end is moving at the highest speed ever recorded on this ice shelf.\\" On 7 July the Project MIDAS blog report stated: \\"The latest data from 6th July reveal that, in a release of built-up stresses, the rift branched several times. Using data from ESA's Sentinel-1 satellites, we can see that there are multiple rift tips now within 5 km (3.10 miles) of the ice edge. We expect that these rifts will lead to the formation of several smaller icebergs.\\" On 12 July 2017, Project MIDAS announced that a large, portion of Larsen C had broken from the main ice shelf at some point between 10 and 12 July. The iceberg, designated A-68, weighs more than a trillion tons and is more than thick. Project MIDAS updated their blog information on 19 July 2017 regarding Larsen C by revealing that a possible new rift appeared to be extending northwards from the point where A-68 had broken off in mid-July. The project researchers felt this questionable new rift might turn towards the shelf edge, compounding the risk that it would \\"continue on to Bawden ice rise\\" which is considered \\"a crucial point of stabilization for Larsen C Ice Shelf.\\" As is true of all floating ice shelves, A68's departure from Antarctica had no immediate effect on global sea levels. However, a number of glaciers discharge onto the shelf from the land behind it, and they may now flow faster due to reduced support from the ice shelf. If all the ice that the Larsen C shelf currently holds back were to enter the sea, global waters would rise by an estimated . Larsen D The Larsen D Ice Shelf is between Smith Peninsula in the south and Gipps Ice Rise. It is considered to be generally stable. Over roughly the past fifty years it has advanced (expanded) whereas comparable George VI, Bach, Stange, and Larsen C ice shelves have retreated (to a much greater net extent). The most recent survey of Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front. This makes it difficult to interpret the ice front because the semi-permanent sea ice varies in thickness and may be nearly indistinguishable from shelf ice.Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula over the past 50 years.

Examples of piston valves are: * The valves used in many brass instruments * The valves used in pneumatic cannons * The valves used in many stationary steam engines and steam locomotives Brass instruments A trumpet's piston valve Cylindrical piston valves called P√©rinet valves (after their inventor Fran√ßois P√©rinet) are used to change the length of tube in the playing of most brass instruments, particularly the trumpet-like members of the family (cornet, flugelhorn, saxhorn, etc.). Other brass instruments use rotary valves, notably the orchestral horns and many tuba models, but also a number of rotary-valved variants of those brass instruments which more commonly employ piston valves. The first piston-valved musical instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The St√∂lzel valve (invented by Heinrich St√∂lzel in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However most professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century. Pneumatic cannon A piston valve can also refer to a 2-way 2-position, pilot-operated spool valve. The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals. The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back by the force of the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to quick exhaust valves. This type of piston valve is also sometimes referred to as a back-pressure valve.

Rotary valves have been applied in numerous applications, including: * Changing the pitch of brass instruments. * Controlling the steam and exhaust ports of steam engines, most notably in the Corliss steam engine. * Periodically reversing the flow of air and fuel across the open hearth furnace. * Loading sample on chromatography columns. * Certain types of two-stroke and four-stroke engines. * Most hydraulic automotive power steering control valves. Use in brass instruments horn In the context of brass instruments, rotary valves are found on horns, trumpets, trombones, flugelhorns, and tubas. Many European trumpet players tend to favor rotary valves. Trombone F-attachment valves are usually rotary, with several variations on the basic design also in use, such as the Thayer axial-flow valve and Hagmann valve. Joseph Riedl is credited with the first use of rotary valves on brass instruments in 1832. Rotary valves on a trumpet Use in industry In industry, a rotary valve is used to regulate the flow of a product, usually to reduce the flow rate to a level more suitable to the process being undertaken. Typical applications are for feeding a weighed hopper or for feeding a mill that can be clogged by the product. As part of the material exchange process, the valve is often used as a measuring or metering device. A rotary valve in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industry is used to dose and feed solid bulk products within the processes. Airlock type rotary valve is often used to enter or extract material from two chambers with different pressure level. Use in engine design Itala rotary valve engine (1912). Itala rotary valve cooling (1919). The rotary valve combustion engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional assemblies, including significantly higher compression ratios and rpm, meaning more power, a much more compact and light-weight cylinder head, and reduced complexity, meaning higher reliability and lower cost. As inlet and exhaust are usually combined special attention should be given to valve cooling to avoid engine knocking. Rotary valves have been used in several different engine designs. In Britain, the National Engine Company Ltd advertised its rotary valve engine for use in early aircraft, at a time when poppet valves were prone to failure by sticking or burning.Flight magazine, April 1911 From the 1930s, Frank Aspin developed a design with a rotary valve that rotated on the same axis as the cylinder bore, but with limited success.Aspin Rotary Valve Engine Accessed on 18th Oct 2010 Kawasaki and others have also used rotary valves in two-stroke motorcycle engines, where the arrangement helps to prevent reverse flow back into the intake port during the compression stroke.Free engine info Accessed on 18th Oct 2010 Austrian engine manufacturer Rotax used rotary intake valves in their now out-of- production Rotax 532 two-stroke engine design and continues to use rotary intake valves in the 532's successor, the current-production Rotax 582.Raisner, William: LEAF catlog, pages 6-105. Leading Edge Airfoils, 1995. US company Coates International Ltd has developed a spherical rotary valve for internal combustion engines which replaces the poppet valve system. This particular design is four-stroke, with the rotary valves operated by overhead shafts in lieu of overhead camshafts (i.e. in line with a bank of cylinders). The first sale of such an engine was part of a natural gas engine- generator.Coates International Accessed on 3rd Mar 2011 Rotary valves are potentially highly suitable for high-revving engines, such as those used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. Rotary valves could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used rotary valves but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer Bishop Innovation and Mercedes-Ilmor tested rotary valves for a F1 V10 engine. Bishop Innovations' patent for the rotary valve engine was bought out by BRV Pty Ltd, owned by Tony Wallis, one of the valves original designers. BRV has constructed several functional motors using the rotary valve technology, such as a Honda CRF 450, which had greater torque at both low(17% increase) and high (9% increase) engine speeds, and also produced more brake horsepower up to around 30% more at functional engine speeds. The engine was also considerably smaller and lighter, as the cylinder head assembly was not as large. A company in the UK called Roton Engine Developments made some progress in 2005 with a 2 rotor (one for inlet and one for exhaust) on a motorcycle single cylinder Husaberg. They filed patents and got an example running in 2006 but were backed by MG Rover who subsequently went bust, leaving Roton without enough funds to continue. The designs surfaced some years later in Australia with Engine Developments Australia Pty Ltd. A prototype casting was produced in 2013 on a Kawasaki Ninja 300 parallel twin unit. This unit is still in development phase at the time of writing but is significant as it has the potential to run much higher compression ratios than even other rotary valve engines due to a significant but undisclosed new cooling method of the combustion chamber and the ability to eliminate the throttle completely, making it vastly more economical at lower engine speeds, so it is claimed. A proven completely successful automotive rotary valve engine has been built by the late Ralph Ogden Watson of Auckland New Zealand, during 1989. The car has covered many trouble free miles from that date and remains in use. Success was achieved as a result of the design of a significant novel sealing arrangement for the rotating valve, a factor previously completely inhibiting the use of the principle involved. No new or only recently available materials were involved. Full details of the car and engine appear in the book \\"Ralph Watson Special Engineer,\\" first published 2004, ISBN O-476-01371-2 and available free and easily searchable, on the internet as of 2020. Signficantly the project proved the principle as being unlikely to prove commercially viable. Use in production engines UK company RCV Engines Ltd uses rotating cylinder liner technology as a specialized form of rotary valve in some of their four-stroke model engine and small-engine line-up. RCV also use horizontal and vertical rotary valves in four-stroke engines in their current range of engines. RCV have developed a 125cc rotating cylinder liner engine, incorporating a rotating valve in the cylinder liner, for scooter applications. PGO Scooters of Taiwan were working with RCV in developing the engine for their applications. The Suzuki RG500 \\"Gamma\\" was powered by a two-stroke, rotary valve, twin crank, square four engine displacing 498 cubic centimeters. The power output was 93.7 brake horsepower (69.9 kW) at 9,500 RPM. Use in chromatography Rotary valves are used for loading samples on columns used for liquid or gas chromatography. The valves used in these methods are usually 6-port, 2-position rotary valves.

Name Wilkes Land gets its name from Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition Wilkes Land is named after Lieutenant Charles Wilkes (later a rear admiral), the American explorer who commanded the 1838‚Äì42 United States Exploring Expedition. The naming is in recognition of Wilkes' discovery of the continental margin over a distance of 2,400 km (1,500 miles) of coast, thus providing substantial proof that Antarctica is a continent. This definition of extent excludes the area east of 142¬∞02' E, George V Land, which was sighted by Wilkes but has been shown by later expeditions to be further south than the positions originally assigned by him.

It was introduced by in his work on projective representations. Examples and properties The Schur multiplier \\\\operatorname{M}(G) of a finite group G is a finite abelian group whose exponent divides the order of G. If a Sylow p-subgroup of G is cyclic for some p, then the order of \\\\operatorname{M}(G) is not divisible by p. In particular, if all Sylow p-subgroups of G are cyclic, then \\\\operatorname{M}(G) is trivial. For instance, the Schur multiplier of the nonabelian group of order 6 is the trivial group since every Sylow subgroup is cyclic. The Schur multiplier of the elementary abelian group of order 16 is an elementary abelian group of order 64, showing that the multiplier can be strictly larger than the group itself. The Schur multiplier of the quaternion group is trivial, but the Schur multiplier of dihedral 2-groups has order 2. The Schur multipliers of the finite simple groups are given at the list of finite simple groups. The covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups are of considerable recent interest. Relation to projective representations A projective representation of G can be pulled back to a linear representation of a central extension C of G. Schur's original motivation for studying the multiplier was to classify projective representations of a group, and the modern formulation of his definition is the second cohomology group H^2(G, \\\\Complex^{\\\\times}). A projective representation is much like a group representation except that instead of a homomorphism into the general linear group \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\Complex), one takes a homomorphism into the projective general linear group \\\\operatorname{PGL}(n, \\\\Complex). In other words, a projective representation is a representation modulo the center. showed that every finite group G has associated to it at least one finite group C, called a Schur cover, with the property that every projective representation of G can be lifted to an ordinary representation of C. The Schur cover is also known as a covering group or Darstellungsgruppe. The Schur covers of the finite simple groups are known, and each is an example of a quasisimple group. The Schur cover of a perfect group is uniquely determined up to isomorphism, but the Schur cover of a general finite group is only determined up to isoclinism. Relation to central extensions The study of such covering groups led naturally to the study of central and stem extensions. A central extension of a group G is an extension :1 \\\\to K\\\\to C\\\\to G\\\\to 1 where K\\\\le Z(C) is a subgroup of the center of C. A stem extension of a group G is an extension :1 \\\\to K\\\\to C\\\\to G\\\\to 1 where K\\\\le Z(C)\\\\cap C' is a subgroup of the intersection of the center of C and the derived subgroup of C; this is more restrictive than central. If the group G is finite and one considers only stem extensions, then there is a largest size for such a group C, and for every C of that size the subgroup K is isomorphic to the Schur multiplier of G. If the finite group G is moreover perfect, then C is unique up to isomorphism and is itself perfect. Such C are often called universal perfect central extensions of G, or covering group (as it is a discrete analog of the universal covering space in topology). If the finite group G is not perfect, then its Schur covering groups (all such C of maximal order) are only isoclinic. It is also called more briefly a universal central extension, but note that there is no largest central extension, as the direct product of G and an abelian group form a central extension of G of arbitrary size. Stem extensions have the nice property that any lift of a generating set of G is a generating set of C. If the group G is presented in terms of a free group F on a set of generators, and a normal subgroup R generated by a set of relations on the generators, so that G \\\\cong F/R, then the covering group itself can be presented in terms of F but with a smaller normal subgroup S, that is, C\\\\cong F/S. Since the relations of G specify elements of K when considered as part of C, one must have S \\\\le [F,R]. In fact if G is perfect, this is all that is needed: C ‚âÖ [F,F]/[F,R] and M(G) ‚âÖ K ‚âÖ R/[F,R]. Because of this simplicity, expositions such as handle the perfect case first. The general case for the Schur multiplier is similar but ensures the extension is a stem extension by restricting to the derived subgroup of F: M(G) ‚âÖ (R ‚à© [F, F])/[F, R]. These are all slightly later results of Schur, who also gave a number of useful criteria for calculating them more explicitly. Relation to efficient presentations In combinatorial group theory, a group often originates from a presentation. One important theme in this area of mathematics is to study presentations with as few relations as possible, such as one relator groups like Baumslag-Solitar groups. These groups are infinite groups with two generators and one relation, and an old result of Schreier shows that in any presentation with more generators than relations, the resulting group is infinite. The borderline case is thus quite interesting: finite groups with the same number of generators as relations are said to have a deficiency zero. For a group to have deficiency zero, the group must have a trivial Schur multiplier because the minimum number of generators of the Schur multiplier is always less than or equal to the difference between the number of relations and the number of generators, which is the negative deficiency. An efficient group is one where the Schur multiplier requires this number of generators. A fairly recent topic of research is to find efficient presentations for all finite simple groups with trivial Schur multipliers. Such presentations are in some sense nice because they are usually short, but they are difficult to find and to work with because they are ill-suited to standard methods such as coset enumeration. Relation to topology In topology, groups can often be described as finitely presented groups and a fundamental question is to calculate their integral homology H_n(G, \\\\Z). In particular, the second homology plays a special role and this led Heinz Hopf to find an effective method for calculating it. The method in is also known as Hopf's integral homology formula and is identical to Schur's formula for the Schur multiplier of a finite group: : H_2(G, \\\\Z) \\\\cong (R \\\\cap [F, F])/[F, R] where G \\\\cong F/R and F is a free group. The same formula also holds when G is a perfect group. The recognition that these formulas were the same led Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane to the creation of cohomology of groups. In general, :H_2(G, \\\\Z) \\\\cong \\\\bigl( H^2(G, \\\\Complex^{\\\\times}) \\\\bigr)^* where the star denotes the algebraic dual group. Moreover, when G is finite, there is an unnatural isomorphism :\\\\bigl( H^2(G, \\\\Complex^{\\\\times}) \\\\bigr)^* \\\\cong H^2(G, \\\\Complex^{\\\\times}). The Hopf formula for H_2(G) has been generalised to higher dimensions. For one approach and references see the paper by Everaert, Gran and Van der Linden listed below. A perfect group is one whose first integral homology vanishes. A superperfect group is one whose first two integral homology groups vanish. The Schur covers of finite perfect groups are superperfect. An acyclic group is a group all of whose reduced integral homology vanishes.

Big Basin is California's oldest state park. It contains beautiful waterfalls and some of the largest, tallest, and oldest Redwood forests left in existence. The trail usually takes two to three days to complete, with nearly all thru-hikers traveling from East to West (towards the ocean). It is possible to walk the entire trail in one day, though this is unusual and very difficult. However, there is a 50-km (31-mi) ultra running race held on this trail one or two times per year. Many hikers like to take a detour up Berry Creek Trail to see the waterfalls or to camp at Sunset Trail Camp, adding to the hike. The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail passing through a stand of California Redwood trees. The trail begins at Saratoga Gap on the ridge at the intersection of SR 9 and Skyline Boulevard (SR 35), although many hikers actually begin at Castle Rock due to its overnight parking facility. The trail parallels SR 9 through Castle Rock, crosses the highway, and then follows SR 236 to Big Basin park headquarters. It then descends through Big Basin, following Waddell Creek to its outlet at Waddell Beach. Santa Cruz Metro routes 35 and 40 formerly went from Big Basin State Park Headquarters to Waddell Creek and back. Since September 2011 Route 40 no longer goes all the way to Waddell Beach from mid-December to mid-March.METRO News Bulletins page but instead turns around at Cement Plant Rd. Route 35 only stops at the Headquarters on the weekends during the Spring/Summer season. There is a proposed plan for a \\"Saratoga-to-the-Sea\\" Trail. The plan would create a trail starting somewhere near Hakone Gardens in Saratoga, passing through a defunct quarry, and terminating in Sanborn-Skyline County Park. This trail would connect to the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail via a completed section of the Bay Area Ridge Trail. The quarry is owned by the Santa Clara County Roads and Airports Department, which is conducting feasibility studies of this plan.

The sound connects the Ross Sea to the north with the Ross Ice Shelf cavity to the south via Haskell Strait. The strait is largely covered by the McMurdo Ice Shelf. The Royal Society Range rises from sea level to 4,205 metres (13,796 ft) on the western shoreline. Ross Island, an historic jumping-off point for polar explorers, designates the eastern boundary. The active volcano Mount Erebus at 3,794 metres (12,448 ft) dominates Ross Island. Antarctica's largest scientific base, the United States' McMurdo Station, as well as the New Zealand Scott Base are on the southern shore of the island. Less than 10 percent of McMurdo Sound's shoreline is free of ice. It is the southernmost navigable body of water in the world. Captain James Clark Ross discovered this sound, which is about from the South Pole, in February 1841, and he named it after Lt. Archibald McMurdo of HMS Terror. The sound today serves as a resupply route for cargo ships and for airplanes that land on the floating ice airstrips near the McMurdo Station. However, McMurdo Station's continuous occupation by human beings since 1957/58 has dirtied the harbor of Winter Quarters Bay. The pack ice that girdles the shoreline at Winter Quarters Bay and elsewhere in the sound presents a formidable obstacle to surface ships. Vessels require ice- strengthened hulls and often have to rely upon escort by icebreakers. Such extreme sea conditions have limited access by tourists, who otherwise are appearing in increasing numbers in the open waters of the Antarctic Peninsula. The few tourists who reach the McMurdo Sound find spectacular scenery with wildlife to be seen, including killer whales, seals, Ad√©lie penguins, and emperor penguins. Cold circumpolar currents of the Southern Ocean reduce the flow of warm South Pacific or South Atlantic waters reaching McMurdo Sound and other Antarctic coastal waters. Bitter katabatic winds spilling down from the Antarctic polar plateau into McMurdo Sound demonstrate Antarctica's status as the coldest and windiest continent in the world. The McMurdo Sound freezes over with sea ice about thick during the winter. The Antarctic summer causes the pack ice to break up. Wind and currents may push the ice northward into the Ross Sea, stirring up cold bottom currents that spill into the ocean basins of the world. Temperatures during the dark winter months at McMurdo Station have dropped as low as . However, December and January are the warmest months, with average highs at , according to USA Today. Ice defines strategic role McMurdo Sound's role as a strategic waterway dates back to early 20th century Antarctic exploration. British explorers Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott built bases on the sound's shoreline as jumping-off points for their overland expeditions to the South Pole. McMurdo Sound's logistic importance continues today. Aircraft transporting cargo and passengers land upon frozen runways at Williams Field on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. Moreover, the annual sealift of a cargo ship and fuel tanker rely upon the sound as a supply route to the continent's largest base, the United States' McMurdo Station. Both the U.S. base and New Zealand's nearby Scott Base are on the southern tip of Ross Island. Ross Island is the southmost piece of land in Antarctica that is accessible by ship. In addition, the harbor at McMurdo's Winter Quarters Bay is the world's southmost seaport (Department of Geography, Texas A&M; University). The access by ships depends upon favorable ice conditions. McMurdo Sound during austral winter presents a virtually impenetrable expanse of surface ice. Even during summer, ships approaching McMurdo Sound are often blocked by various concentrations of first-year ice, fast ice (connected to the shoreline), and hard multi-year ice. Subsequently, icebreakers are required for maritime resupply missions to McMurdo Station. Nonetheless, ocean currents and fierce Antarctic winds can drive pack ice north into the Ross Sea, temporarily producing areas of open water. Iceberg B-15A clogs McMurdo Sound calved off Iceberg B-15 caused extensive pack ice buildup in McMurdo Sound, blocking shipping and preventing penguin access to open water. A common event of previously unseen dimensions occurred on the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000 that wreaked havoc at McMurdo Sound more than five years later. The long Iceberg B-15, the largest ever seen at the time, broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000 (Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems: Cooperative Research Center). Then, on 27 October 2005, B-15 suddenly broke up. Research based upon measurements retrieved from a seismometer previously placed on B-15 indicated that ocean swells caused by an earthquake away in the Gulf of Alaska caused the breakup, according to a report by the U.S. National Public Radio. Wind and sea currents shifted a smaller, but still massive Iceberg B-15A towards McMurdo Sound. B-15A's enormous girth temporarily blocked the outflow of pack ice from McMurdo Sound, according to news reports. Iceberg B-15A's grounding at the mouth of McMurdo Sound also blocked the path for thousands of penguins to reach their food source in open water. Moreover, pack ice built up behind the iceberg in the Ross Sea creating a nearly frozen barrier that blocked two cargo ships en route to supply McMurdo Station, according to the National Science Foundation. MV American Tern bringing supplies for McMurdo Station The icebreakers USCGC Polar Star and the Russian Krasin were required to open a ship channel through ice up to thick. The last leg of the channel followed a route along the eastern shoreline of McMurdo Sound adjacent to Ross Island. The icebreakers escorted the tanker USNS Paul Buck to McMurdo Station's ice pier in late January. The freighter MV American Tern followed on 3 February. Similar pack ice blocked a National Geographic expedition aboard the Braveheart from reaching B-15A. However, expedition divers were able to explore the underwater world of another grounded tabular iceberg. They encountered a surprising environment of fish and other sea life secreted within a deep iceberg crevasse. Discoveries included starfish, crabs, and ice fish. The latter were found to have burrowed thumb-sized holes into the ice. The expedition reported an exceedingly rare and seldom witnessed occurrence of an iceberg exploding. Shards of ice erupted into the air as if a bomb went off, this only hours after divers surfaced and after the Braveheart moved away from the iceberg (National Geographic). Effects of wind Weather instruments such as this device installed upon Iceberg B-15A provide scientists a better understanding of Antarctica's impact upon global climate. Photograph by: Josh Landis. National Science Foundation Polar winds are a driving force behind weather systems arising from three surface zones that converge at McMurdo Sound: the polar plateau and Transantarctic Mountains, the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross Sea. These surface zones create a range of dynamic weather systems. Cold, heavy air descending rapidly from the polar plateau at elevations of or more spawns fierce katabatic winds. These dry winds can reach hurricane force by the time they reach the Antarctic coast. Wind instruments recorded Antarctica's highest wind velocity at the coastal station Dumont d'Urville in July 1972 at (Australian Government Antarctica Division). Prevailing winds spilling into McMurdo Sound shoot between mountain passes and other land formations, stirring up blizzards known locally as \\"Herbies\\". Such blizzards can occur any time of year. Residents of McMurdo Station and Scott Base have dubbed the nearby White Island and Black Island as Herbie Alley due to winds that funnel blizzards between the islands (Field Manual for the U.S. Antarctic Program). Overall the continent's extreme cold air scarcely holds enough moisture for snowfall. Consequently, Antarctica's blizzards are at times as much about wind stirring up existing snow as they are about new snowfall. For instance, the water equivalent from annual snow fall on Ross Island averages only (National Science Foundation). Snowfall in Antarctica's interior is far less at . Noted as well are the McMurdo Dry Valleys on the western shores of McMurdo Sound where snow seldom accumulates. Antarctica's shortfall in new snow does not lessen the continent's striking polar climate. Antarctica essentially doubles in size during the winter as the surrounding sea water freezes (Antarctic Connection). The subsequent annual summer melt of the estimated of ice that rings Antarctica creates the planet's largest seasonal climate event (USA Today). The result is a vertical circulation driven by a massive heat and energy exchange between ice, ocean, and atmosphere. McMurdo Sound provides an important component in Antarctica's global effects upon climate. A key factor is the polar winds that can drive the sound's pack ice into the Ross Sea summer or winter. Frigid katabatic winds rake subsequent exposed water, causing sea ice to form. Freezing surface water excludes salt from the water below; leaving behind heavy, cold water that sinks to the ocean floor. This process repeats itself along Antarctica's coastal areas, spreading cold sea water outward into the world's ocean basins.Australian Government Antarctic Division According to an interview with a climatologist Gerd Wendler, published in the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Sun, one could dive to the ocean floor anywhere in the world and encounter water from the coast of Antarctica. \\"Seventy five percent of all the bottom water, wherever you are, comes from Antarctica.\\" McMurdo Station *Average mean sea-level temp: *Monthly mean range: in January to in August *Stormiest months: February and October Source: U.S. National Science Foundation Antarctica *Coldest, highest, windiest continent in the world *Highest recorded wind velocity: , Dumont d'Urville Station, July 1972 Source: Australian Government Antarctica Division Life below the ice A research diver reaches towards a jellyfish that thrives in the salt water of McMurdo Sound. A rich sea life thrives under the barren expanse of McMurdo Sound's ice pack. For example, frigid waters that would kill many other fish in the world sustain the Antarctic notothenioids, a bony \\"ice fish\\" related to walleyes and perch. The notothenioids feature an Antifreeze protein in their bloodstream that prevents them from freezing. Notothenioids account for more than 50 percent of the number of fish species in the Antarctic coastal regions and 90 to 95 percent of the biomass, according to the National Academy of Sciences for the United States. What some sea creatures lack in numbers, they make up for in their visual presentation. McMurdo Sound divers encounter colorful examples of sea life, including bright yellow cactus sponges and green globe sponges. Starfish, sea urchins, and sea anemones are also present. The latter is noted for its wispy tentacles. Large sea spiders inhabit the deeps of the sound and feed on sea anemone, whereas swarms of Antarctic krill flourish in the upper depths of the icy waters. The shrimp-like krill is a key species in the Southern Ocean food chain for sea life ranging from the baleen whale to penguins. The sound is also home to soft coral, whose flexible form allows the creature to bend so as to feed off the ocean floor.Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island & McMurdo Sound Adamussium colbecki, sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri, sea sponge Homaxinella balfourensis, brittlestar Ophionotus victoriae and sea spider Colossendeis Antarctic penguins, famous for their waddling walk on surface ice, transform themselves into graceful and powerful swimmers underwater. The emperor penguins' pursuit of squid, fish, and crustaceans leads them to dive as deep as . However, the emperor can go deeper. Scientists have found that the penguin can reach for short durations. The much smaller Ad√©lie penguin is less ambitious. It feeds underwater for up to two minutes at a maximum depth of . The Weddell seal out-dives even the emperor penguin. The seal can hold its breath for up to 80 minutes and reach a depth of (Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island & McMurdo Sound). Scientists diving in McMurdo also encounter the leopard seal, and crabeater seal. The many-storied leopard seal is a ferocious predator that preys on warm-blooded animals, such as other seals and penguins, whereas the more sedate crabeater uses its unusual multilobed teeth to sieve krill from the water.

National Science Foundation.More than 50 years of continuous operation of the United States and New Zealand bases on Ross Island have left pockets of severe pollution marring McMurdo Sound's pristine environment. Until 1981, McMurdo Station residents simply towed their garbage out to the sea ice and let nature take its course. The garbage sank to the sea floor when the ice broke up in the spring, according to news reports. A 2001 survey of the seabed near McMurdo revealed 15 vehicles, 26 shipping containers, and 603 fuel drums, as well as some 1,000 miscellaneous items dumped on an area of some . Findings by scuba divers were reported in the State of the Environment Report, a New Zealand sponsored study. The study by the government agency Antarctica New Zealand revealed that decades of daily pumping thousands of gallons of raw sewage from 1,200 summer residents into the sound had fouled Winter Quarters Bay, the harbor at McMurdo. The pollution ended in 2003 when a $5 million waste treatment plant went online. Other documented bay water contaminants include leakage from an open dump at the station. The dump introduced heavy metals, petroleum compounds, and chemicals into the water. Zoologist Clive Evans from Auckland University described McMurdo's harbor as \\"one of the most polluted harbors in the world in terms of oil\\", according to a 2004 article by the New Zealand Herald. Modern operations in McMurdo Sound have sparked surface cleanup efforts, recycling, and exporting trash and other contaminants by ship. The U.S. National Science Foundation began a 5-year, $30-million cleanup program in 1989, according to Reuters News Agency.\\"U.S. Antarctic Base at McMUrdo Sound a Dump; Environment: Trashing began in last century with the start of exploration. The waste area is fenced off to slow the escape of wind-blown rubbish\\", Reuters. December 29, 1991. The concentrated effort targeted the open dump at McMurdo. By 2003, the U.S. Antarctic Program reported recycling approximately 70% of its wastes, according to Australia's Herald Sun. The Erebus Ice Tongue near the ship channel used during annual resupply missions to McMurdo Station (NASA) The 1989 cleanup included workers testing hundreds of barrels at the dump site, mostly full of fuels and human waste, for identification before they are loaded onto a freighter for exportation. The precedent for exporting wastes began in 1971. The United States shipped out tons of radiation-contaminated soil after officials shut down a small nuclear power plant.Antarctic dump leaks waste\\", Courier Mail. 20 March 1991. Yet the very ships involved in supporting the export of McMurdo Station's waste present pollution hazards themselves. A study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that anti-fouling paints on the hulls of icebreakers are polluting McMurdo Sound.\\"Toxic chemicals from ice-breaking ships are polluting Antarctic seas\\", New Scientist. 22 May 2004. This article cites a study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which was slated to be published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. Such paints kill algae, barnacles, and other marine life that adhere to ship hulls. Scientists found that samples taken from the ocean floor contained high levels of tributyltin (TBT), a component of the anti- fouling paints. \\"The levels are close to the maximum, you will find anywhere, apart from ship grounding sites\\", said Andrew Negri of the institute. Ships, aircraft, and land-based operations in McMurdo Sound all present hazards of oil spills or fuel leaks. For instance, in 2003, the build-up of two years of difficult ice conditions blocked the U.S. tanker MV Richard G. Matthiesen from reaching the harbor at McMurdo Station, despite the assistance of icebreakers. Instead shore workers rigged a temporary fuel line over the ice pack to discharge the ship's cargo. The ship pumped more than of fuel to storage facilities at McMurdo.\\"NSF chooses alternative method to refuel its main Antarctic research station; Unusual, multi-year ice conditions keep tanker out of McMurdo Station\\", M2 Presswire. 27 February 2003 Officials balance the potential for fuel spills inherent in such operations against the critical need to keep McMurdo Station supplied with oil.

Tourism surge yet to reach McMurdo Most visitors to Antarctica's frozen landscape arrive via ship-borne cruises. Antarctica's extreme remoteness and hazardous travel conditions limit Antarctica tourism to an expensive niche industry largely centered on the Antarctic Peninsula. The number of seaborne tourists grew fourfold during the 1990s, reaching more than 14,000 by 2000, up from 2,500 ten years earlier.\\"Is rise in tourism helping Antarctica or hurting it?\\", Travel Watch; National Geographic Traveler. 22 August 2003. More than 46,000 airborne and seaborne tourists visited Antarctica during the 2007‚Äì2008 season, according to the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO). This confederation of tour operators reports that only 5% of Antarctic tourists visit the Ross Sea area, which encompasses McMurdo Sound. Tourists congregate on the ice-free coastal zones during summer near the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula's wildlife, soaring mountains, and dramatic seascapes have drawn commercial visitors since the late 1950s, when Argentina and Chile operated cruises to the South Shetland Islands.Science and Stewardship in the Antarctic: Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources. 1993 Tourists flights began in 1957, when a Pan American Boeing 377 Stratocruiser made the first civilian flight to Antarctica. Commercial flights landed at McMurdo Sound and the South Pole in the 1960s. Routine overflights from Australia and New Zealand took place between 1977 and 1980, transporting more than 11,000 passengers, according to Antarctica New Zealand, which manages Scott Base. One such flight, Air New Zealand Flight 901, crashed into Mount Erebus on the eastern shores of McMurdo Sound. The crash high on the slopes of the active volcano took the lives of all 257 people aboard the aircraft. In 1969 the MS Explorer brought seagoing tourists to Antarctica (British Antarctic Survey). The cruise's founder, Lars-Eric Lindblad, coupled expeditionary cruising with education. He is quoted as saying, \\"You can't protect what you don't know\\" (IAATO). In the decades since then, ships engaged in Antarctic sight-seeing cruises have grown in size and number. A Zodiac inflatable is hoisted aboard an expedition cruise ship in Antarctic waters after ferrying passengers to shore. Infrequent Antarctic cruises have included passenger vessels carrying up to 960 tourists (IAATO). Such vessels may conduct so-called \\"drive-by\\" cruises, with no landings made ashore. The Russian Kapitan Khlebnikov has conducted voyages to the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea regions since 1992. High-latitude cruises in dense pack ice are only achievable during the summer season, November into March. In 1997, the vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov claimed the distinction of being the first ship to circumnavigate Antarctica with passengers (Quark Expeditions). Passengers aboard the icebreaker make landings aboard Zodiac inflatable boats to explore remote beaches. Their itinerary may also include stops at Ross Island's historic explorer huts at Discovery Point near McMurdo Station or Cape Royds (Antarctica New Zealand). Additionally, the Russian icebreaker extends the reach of tourism by launching helicopter trips from its decks, including visits to sites such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys and areas noted for wildlife viewing. The 'Spirit of Enderby has been conducting cruises to the Ross Sea region for many years, including McMurdo Sound. Although the Enderby has an ice-strengthened hull, the ship is not an icebreaker. The Enderby sports Zodiac inflatable boats, a hovercraft for Antarctica voyages, and all-terrain vehicles for over ice or overland travel. Land-based tourism in Antarctica, however, continues to be rare. Antarctica lacks a permanent land-based tourism facility, despite the annual surge in the number of visitors. The International Association of Tour Operators (IAATO) has established voluntary standards to discourage tourists from disrupting wildlife. Nonetheless, large ships, carrying more than 400 passengers, may spend up to 12 hours transporting tourists to and from breeding sites. Such large-ship operations expose wildlife to humans far longer than smaller vessels.

Category:Sounds of Antarctica Category:Bodies of water of the Ross Dependency ","title":"McMurdo Sound"},{"id":"1121604","text":"Marchmont is a mainly residential area of Edinburgh, Scotland. It lies roughly one mile to the south of the Old Town, separated from it by The Meadows and Bruntsfield Links. To the west it is bounded by Bruntsfield; to the south- southwest by Greenhill and then Morningside; to the south-southeast by The Grange; and to the east by Sciennes. The area is characterised by four- and five-storey tenements blocks built in the Scots Baronial style. Most of the area was developed in the 1870s and 1880s and there has been little change to its structure since then. Marchmont remains popular with older residents, young professionals and students. It was designated as a Conservation Area in 1987 along with Bruntsfield and the Meadows. History The area was developed as a planned middle-class suburb by Sir George Warrender, the owner of Bruntsfield House and the surrounding estate (which was also known as the Warrender Park) in the middle of the 19th century. This was at a time of rapid population growth in Edinburgh, stimulating a significant increase in the demand for housing. The original feuing plan laid out by architect David Bryce in 1869 called for mainly terraced villas, with a number of large, detached villas on Marchmont Road. However, this was superseded by a more comprehensive plan prepared by the firm of John Watherston & Sons. This proposed that all buildings were to be four- or five-storey tenements, some with commercial premises on the ground floor frontages. Most of the buildings were completed in the 1870s and 1880s. The first tenements to go up were mostly in pink sandstone in the Scots Baronial style; these are by architects such as Edward Calvert. The later buildings, which were often in blonde sandstone and in a plainer, more uniform style, include works by Hippolyte Blanc, John Charles Hay and Thomas P. Marwick. Key buildings such as churches are mainly by the then city architect, Robert Morham. Originally, the area was not allowed to have any premises selling alcohol, although that is no longer the case.  Street names  As was the usual practice at the time, the area's street names were derived from members of the developer's family or places associated with them. Sir George Warrender's wife, Helen, was the daughter of the 5th Earl of Marchmont, hence the name of the district. Thirlestane Street and Lauderdale Street were named in honour of Sir George's mother, who was the daughter of the Earl of Lauderdale and whose family seat was at Thirlestane Castle. Spottiswoode Street and Spottiswoode Road were named for John Spottiswoode, another Warrender relation, while Arden, as in Arden Street, was the family name of the Earl of Haddington, who married one of the Warrender daughters. Marchmont today Warrender Park Road, Marchmont Due to its proximity to the city centre, the presence of local amenities, and generally being considered a pleasant area, Marchmont is considered a desirable location in which to live. This is reflected in its generally high property prices. It is popular with students, with both the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Napier University within easy walking distance. This has resulted in a certain friction between permanent residents and temporary ones (many of whom are students), with the Marchmont Action Group Promoting Initiatives for the Environment (MAGPIE) unsuccessfully petitioning the Scottish Parliament in 2005 to impose quotas on shared accommodation by restricting the number of licences for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) granted for the area. Notable buildings Warrender Baths The Warrender Baths building in Thirlestane Road, was opened in 1887 on land donated by Sir George Warrender. It houses a swimming pool and a fitness complex. It is noted for its neo- Jacobean frontage, its mosaic tiling and its old-fashioned poolside changing facilities. The building is a Category B listed building. Marchmont St Giles Church is situated to the immediate south of the area, at the north end of Kilgraston Road. It has been described as one of the most prominent landmarks of south Edinburgh. Designed by Robert Morham, it opened in 1871, replacing a previous iron building. James Gillespie's High School has occupied its present site between Lauderdale Street and Warrender Park Road since the 1960s.

Covering an area of ; it borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north- east, and Hampshire to the east. The great variation in its landscape owes much to the underlying geology which includes an almost unbroken sequence of rocks from 200 Ma to 40 Ma and superficial deposits from 2 Ma to the present.Chaffey (pp.5‚Äì6) In general the oldest rocks (Early Jurassic) appear in the far west of the county, with the most recent (Eocene) in the far east. Jurassic rocks also underlie the Blackmore Vale and comprise much of the coastal cliff in the west and south of the county; and although younger Cretaceous rocks crown some of the highpoints in the west, they are mainly to be found in the centre and east of the county.Chaffey (p.6) Dorset's coastline is one of the most visited and studied coastlines in the world because it shows, along the course of (including some of east Devon), rocks from the beginning of Triassic, through the Jurassic and up to the end of the Cretaceous, documenting the entire Mesozoic era with well-preserved fossils.House (1993) pp.1‚Äì4 Throughout Dorset there are a number of limestone ridges.Chaffey pp.5‚Äì7 The largest and most notable is the band of Cretaceous chalk that runs from the south-west to the north-east of the county and forms part of the Chalk Group that underlies much of the south of England, including Salisbury Plain, the Isle of Wight and the South Downs. Between the bands of limestone and chalk are wide clay vales with flood plains. South-east Dorset, around Poole, Bournemouth and the New Forest, lies on younger and less resistant beds: Eocene clays (mainly London Clay), sands and gravels. These rocks produce thin soils that historically have supported a heathland habitat. The chalk and limestone hills of the Purbecks lie atop Britain's largest onshore oil field. The field, operated from Wytch Farm, produces a high- quality oil and has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge, which has been in use since the early 1960s.Cullingford (p.122) The source of this oil is the organic-rich shales found in the lower lias. Landslides along the coast have been known to ignite these shales causing cliff fires, the most recent of which occurred in 2000.Ensom (1998) pp.22‚Äì23 Devonian to Triassic 380‚Äì201 Ma (late Devonian ‚Äì late Triassic) 380 million years ago (Ma) the landmass that was later to form Southern Britain was some 19 degrees south of the equator and lay on the northern shore of an ocean basin that separated the continents of Laurasia and Gondwanaland. When these continents collided to form the single super-continent of Pangaea, the sediments on the ocean floor were pushed up and over while the molten rock below the surface was forced out.Ensom (p.13) Today, these igneous intrusions and the red sandstones, visible in the neighbouring county of Devon, slope away from west to east and are deeply buried beneath younger deposits in Dorset.Ensom (p.14) [Needs section on the Triassic adding] Around 204 Ma Dorset, now 30 degrees north, was under water and the first ammonites (Psiloceras planorbis) appear among the shales and limestones that make up the lower Lias.Ensom (p.19) 204‚Äì185 Ma (late Triassic ‚Äì early Jurassic) The blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis Formed somewhere between 185 Ma and 204 Ma, in what was then a shallow marine environment, the Lower Lias Lias is composed of Blue Lias, Black Ven Marls and Green Ammonite Beds (Charmouth Mudstone Formation). Mostly covered by lush vegetation, it forms the floor of Marshwood Vale in the west of Dorset and can be seen in stream beds, where the land has been excavated, and along the coast to the west of Seatown. The sides of the vale are mainly made from the clays and sands of the upper and lower Lias while younger strata from the Cretaceous Period (145‚Äì66 Ma), crown the higher points.Ensom (p.21) The Blue Lias is the lowest of the Liassic stratum and where it is visible on the coast near Lyme Regis is layered with hard limestone and oil-rich shale.Ensom (p.22) The iron pyrites in the clay can heat up when exposed to the air and occasionally ignite the shales.Ensom (p.23) Around Lyme Regis, during the 18th and 19th centuries, the collecting and sale of fossils became a popular occupation. Landslides and the excavation of the clays, used in cement production, exposed not only an abundance of ammonites of varying size, but much larger specimens such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.Ensom (p.23) Although these rocks were formed underwater, the discovery of fossil wood, land-dwelling animals and a pterosaur suggest that dry land was close by.Ensom (p.24) Jurassic 185‚Äì182 Ma (early Jurassic) Laid down between 185 Ma and 182 Ma years ago in a shallower marine environment that was subjected to much more turbulent weather conditions, the sediments of the Middle Lias are not as muddy as those in the lower Lias, and are much nearer to silt and sand.Ensom (p.25) These sands are thought to have come from the islands that now form part of Cornwall and South Wales. Again, inland exposure is poor, although the middle Lias is visible along the spring line of the hills that surround the Marshwood Vale. The cliffs either side of Eype and the coastal stretch between Thorncombe and Watton Cliff provide the best view. The base of the middle Lias is composed of three thick layers of calcareous sandstone beds separated by marls. These resistant bands form massive buttresses along the sea-cliffs and, where eroded, boulder aprons on the foreshore. Above these three layers is the Eype clay, which was probably deposited in deeper, calmer waters.Ensom (p.26) Ammonites found in this layer have apparently been attacked by larger crustaceans. The fossilised remains of large numbers of brittle stars, found towards the end of this deposition, indicate that they were rapidly covered. Theories put forward suggest a great storm or tidal wave was the cause and indeed many of the remains appear to have been swept along the sediment, some losing limbs on the way. This particular section of the lias is appropriately known as the \\"starfish bed\\".Ensom (P.26-27) The succeeding layers of Downcliffe and Thorncombe sands also appear to have been deposited in a periodically stormy environment where silts and sands dominate. Pebbles and cobbles are found here, encrusted with fossilised animals, which suggests that some of the sediments were already lithified; there is also some evidence of localised fault activity.Ensom (p.28) The last layer in the middle Lias is the Marlstone Rock Bed. 182‚Äì174 Ma (early Jurassic) The distinctive yellow cliffs near West Bay, formed of Bridport sand The lowest part of the Upper Lias, formed around 182 Ma, is known as the junction bed and despite representing 3,000,000 years, is only 0.6 to 1.5 metres thick, where it can be seen at Eype Mouth.Ensom (p.29) In Yorkshire the equivalent strata is around 100 metres thick, suggesting that Dorset remained underwater much longer and was robbed of supplies of sand and clay. This bed is composed of fine-grained limestones from white to pale pink in colour. The clearest evidence of fault activity exists in a section of cliff between West Bay and Eype Mouth, where the junction bed thickens in a section of steps, and fractures in the rock contain sediment from the ocean bed which, most likely, was sucked in as the cracks opened. The remaining part of the upper Lias is the bright yellow Bridport sandstone that gives the cliffs between West Bay and Burton Bradstock their distinctive colour.Ensom (p.31) The sands form a band that runs inland to Yeovil. In the east of the county, these sands are some 900 metres below the surface and form the Wytch Farm oilfield's middle reservoir. 174‚Äì169 Ma (early ‚Äì middle Jurassic) The succeeding Inferior Oolite was deposited in a shallow, tropical marine environment, 35 degrees north of the equator. It is only 2 metres thick in the south but increases to 20 metres in the north, near Sherborne.Ensom (p.32) It contains many fossils, including bryozoans, brachiopods, ammonites, belemnites, gastropods, bivalves and echinoids, and like the previous middle and upper Lias shows signs of fault-controlled deposition. It appears in some places that the sea floor was breached and sediments and fossils were trapped like those in the junction bed between West Bay and Eype. Most of Dorset was starved of sediment and condensed limestones collected. These limestone beds are often iron rich, lending them a rusty colour. One particular bed, exposed at Burton Cliff, contains large numbers of orange, discus-shaped concretions, which on closer inspection reveal themselves to be pieces of shell from a species of mussel, coated with a thin layer of iron-rich sediment.Ensom (p.33) In the upper section of the Inferior Oolite there are two beds packed with numerous types of sponge, which can be seen around Shipton Gorge and Burton Bradstock.Ensom (p.34) Despite being formed in a marine environment, the oolite, like the lower Lias, contains some fossilised remains of land-dwelling creatures, including two species of Megalosaurus that were found near Sherborne. 169‚Äì167 Ma (middle ‚Äì late Jurassic) Fuller's Earth Formation clays were deposited across much of southern Dorset when the continental shelf subsided, forcing the region deeper underwater. The lower clays are visible at Burton Bradstock and contain large numbers of Bositra buchi. It has been suggested that these bivalves were able to swim freely and thus able to avoid the soupy mud on the sea floor.Ensom (pp.35‚Äì36) A limestone known as Fuller's Earth Rock is found in the north-west of the county, between the clays south and east of Sherborne. It is rich in ammonites and bivalves.Ensom (p.36) Previously referred to as the Upper Fuller's Earth Clay, the succeeding Frome Clay can be seen to the west of West Bay where it forms the major part of the West Cliff. It contains many Brachiopods, particularly in the Weymouth Anticline where the oyster beds are 5 metres thick. At the junction between the Frome Clay and the overlying Forest Marble is the Boueti Bed, so called because of the large numbers of the brachiopod, Goniorhynchia boueti found there. It is best viewed on the Herbury peninsula south of Langton Herring. The limestone known as Forest Marble is not a true metamorphic marble but it takes a high polish, and has been used as a building material and marble substitute for many years.Ensom (pp.37‚Äì38) Outcrops of Forest Marble are concentrated around the Weymouth Anticline, the coastal escarpment between Burton Bradstock and Abbotsbury, and inland as far as Bothenhampton, where they disappear below younger Cretaceous deposits. Surfacing once more at Rampisham, they turn east and then north into Somerset.Ensom (p.38) The limestone does not form one continuous bed as previously thought, but rather forms pockets in a formation which is predominately clay. It is likely that severe tropical storms swept up large quantities of shells and other invertebrates and deposited them in this way. The formation of the Forest Marble suggests a shallowing of the sea and the remains of pieces of tree, and bits of land-dwelling animals, are found among the turtles, frogs and salamanders within. 167‚Äì156 Ma (late Jurassic) Between 167 Ma and 156 Ma, the future Dorset, at 36 degrees north, still had a tropical climate and the limestones, clays, silts and sands from this period were laid down in a marine environment that ranged from deep water to tidal shallows.Ensom (p.39) Above the Forest Marble lies the Cornbrash sequence which is dominated by rubbly limestone. Unsuitable for building stone, these limestones have been used lime production and road construction. In the north of the county an already lithified Cornbrash floor was being eroded, and the resulting pebbles gathered serpulid worms, bryozoans and bivalves as they rolled around beneath the shallow sea. The shallow water in which these limestones were deposited was followed by marginally deeper water in which the Kellaway Beds were laid down. The Kellaway Beds are only visible in the banks of streams and rivers, and the brick pits at Chickerell and Rampisham where the succeeding Oxford Clays were quarried.Ensom (pp.39‚Äì40) The Oxford Clays were deposited in much deeper water and cover the valley floors between Weymouth and the Blackmore Vale. They can also be seen in the cliffs at Tidmoor Point, Jordan Hill and the previously mentioned brick pits at Chickerell.Ensom (p.40) Poor exposure, coupled with a decline in the brick industry has made detailed mapping of the clays difficult which now relies heavily on trenches dug for services. These excavations have unearthed some impressive examples of Septarian Nodules. The exposure of Nothe Grit, to the south of Weymouth, suggests a return to shallower water conditions and a more turbulent environment. In the following 4.5 million years a cycle of lagoonal, tidal and deep water environments caused by a world-wide fluctuations in sea levels, deposited beds of sand, clay and limestone across the entire county.Ensom (pp.40‚Äì41) The Corallian strata can be seen on the Weymouth anticline, between Abbotsbury and Osmington. It then disappears to emerge as a low escarpment between Mappowder and Cucklington on the Somerset border. Near the top of this formation is the Ringstead Waxy Clay in which large delta shaped oysters are found and at the top of the Corallian is the Ringstead Coral Bed.Ensom (p.42) Benecliff grit, a soft sandstone containing large doggers, is well exposed at the headland, Bran Point. Once a reservoir, oil sometimes seeps from the cliff here, and an oily residue is present in the sands nearby. 156‚Äì150 Ma (Late Jurassic) Kimmeridge Clay in the cliffs at Egmont Bight The varied rock types of the Corallian are superseded by the Kimmeridge clay, a bed of dark clays and shales up to 500 metres thick. These deposits occurred in a deep marine environment, 38 degrees north, 140 Ma to 145 Ma.Ensom (p.43) Deposited in an oxygen deficient environment, the Kimmeridge beds make up the major part of the Purbeck Monocline and the periphery of the Weymouth Anticline. They form a low lying band running north to south through the Blackmore Vale, and underpin the strip of land between the isle of Portland and the mainland.Chaffey (p.12) The unusual iron rich sediment near Abbotsbury was, in a departure from the norm, deposited in shallow iron rich water and the pale bands throughout the formation were caused by Coccoliths following periodic blooms of algae. Many of the fossilised remains are squashed flat, indicating that the Kimmeridge beds were heavily compacted, perhaps to an eighth of their original thickness. This was not sufficient to produce oil reservoirs like those beneath the North Sea, yet the oil rich shales have, in the past, been economically important as a local fuel.Ensom (pp.45‚Äì46) 150‚Äì145 Ma (Late Jurassic) It is unclear whether the formations created between the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous, were deposited across the whole of Dorset like the preceding beds, and subsequently eroded, or only formed in the areas in which they are now found.Ensom (p.47) The Portland sands were created in a deep marine environment whereas the Portland stone was a near-shore deposit. The lower Portland Sand formation, usually greyish blue in colour, consists of dolomite beds best viewed on the West Weares, Gad Cliff and Hounstout. The overlying Portland stone is a distinctive white oolite containing thick shelled fossils and marine algae.Ensom (p.48) The marine algae which formed large reefs, is responsible for the occasional stacked and arched bands in the formation and is best viewed in the Roach, an extremely fossiliferous limestone confined to the north of Isle of Portland.Ensom (pp.48‚Äì49) To the north of the oolite is a fine grained limestone, which was deposited in calm, shallow water. It contains flint-like rocks known as chert and if it wasn't for the presence of very large ammonites, might be mistaken for an early chalk.Ensom (p.50) Previously thought to be around the middle of the Purbeck Strata, modern research suggests that the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods lies within the basal few metres of the Lower Purbeck. 145‚Äì140 Ma (Late Jurassic ‚Äì early Cretaceous) Part of the fossil forest, West Lulworth The Purbeck Limestone Group is a succession of limestones, shales and clays named after the Isle of Purbeck, laid down mainly in very shallow lagoons and freshwater lakes, with only occasional marine influence at the lower levels where halite, gypsum and other evaporites are found.Ensom (p.51) The muddled sediments around Lulworth are thought to be caused by a thick layer of these evaporites dissolving. There is also evidence of uplift and erosion of earlier formations. The climate around this time had changed from a tropical to a sub- tropical one, with pronounced wet and dry seasons as indicated by the growth rings in the fossilised trees also found in the lower levels of the Purbeck strata.Ensom (pp.51‚Äì52) These trees grew around the low coastal areas and were, from time to time, subjected to drowning from the sea. The fallen trees and their stumps became covered by stromatolites which trapped sediments. The limestones at this level, which vary greatly in colour, are composed of densely packed shells of the freshwater snail Viviparus.Arkell, W. J. (1947), Geology of the country round Weymouth, Swanage, Corfe Castle and Lulworth. London: HMSO for British Geological Survey.Clements, R. G. (1993), \\"Type- section of the Purbeck Limestone Group, Durlston Bay, Swanage, Dorset\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society, 114, 181‚Äì206. Their ability to take a very high polish has led them to become known as Purbeck Marble. Like the older Forest Marble it is a sedimentary marble rather than a true metamorphic one.Ensom (p.52) The Purbeck Limestone Group has yielded a diverse selection of fossilised remains, including rare reptiles, amphibians and mammals, for which the formation has become internationally important.Ensom (pp.52 & 56) Cretaceous 140‚Äì125 Ma (early Cretaceous) The Wealden Beds are confined to the south and increase in thickness from 107 metres to 716 metres, between Upwey and Swanage. By 140 million years ago, the waters covering Dorset's landmass had subsided leaving the area almost completely terrestrial save for the large rivers that dominated it.Ensom (p.57) These rivers drained the upland areas to the north and west, and were responsible for depositing much of the succeeding sediment across southern Dorset. Comprising clays, silts, sands and grits, they cover the floors of the valleys between Lulworth and Swanage. The sands and grits are also exposed in the cliffs there, and form ridges along the valleys. Traces of granite from Cornubia, the landmass that later became Cornwall, were also washed down.Ensom (p.59) The Wealden Beds contain a great deal of plant matter and charcoal indicating periodic fires in the region. At Mupe Bay, some of the sands have been bound together by oil and formed into sandstone boulders, suggesting that oil production had already begun when these sands were deposited. 125‚Äì100 Ma (early ‚Äì late Cretaceous) The marginal marine incursions that occurred in the previous period increased in severity until Dorset was completely underwater. The geology from this period indicates a gradual flooding of the county from the south-east to the north-west.Ensom (p.60) The earliest deposit, the Lower Greensand, covers the preceding Wealden Beds in the south, and the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays in the north. It is so called because of its green colour which is caused by the presence of the mineral glauconite.Ensom (p.62) In the west, overlying the eroded Lias, is a thin layer of Gault Clay which decreases in depth from 27 metres to 7 metres the further west it stretches, and can be located by the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments.Ensom (pp.60&61) The water that sits between these two beds is responsible for the many landslips which have occurred throughout the county's history. Around Compton Valence, it lies on the Fuller's earth whereas between Ringstead and White Nothe, it covers the Kimmeridge Clay and the Portland and Purbeck stratas.Ensom (pp.60‚Äì61) Because geologists are certain all the formations from the Lias to the Kimmeridge Clay were deposited over the whole of the county, the Gault clay reveals the scale of uplift and erosion which must have taken place before Dorset was flooded.Ensom (p.61) The overlying Gault is revealed in the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments. This water is also responsible for the many landslips throughout Dorset's history from the prehistoric to modern times.Ensom (p.62) Above the Gault is the Upper Greensand, which varies from the golden sands that crown the West Dorset heights, such as Pilsdon Pen and Golden Cap, to the rubbly sandstones found in the centre of the county. The fossiliferous, green sandstone found around Shaftesbury contains many ammonites which, when compared to other deposits, indicate condensed deposition during different periods at different locations and detailed analysis reveals that basement structures were still active at this time. 100‚Äì65 Ma (late Cretaceous ‚Äì Paleocene) The sea levels remained more or less unchanged until the end of the Cretaceous period and despite Dorset having moved even further north to 40 degrees, the climate had reverted to a tropical one. During this period, the sea deposited an enormous amount of chalk across the county, perhaps as much as 300 metres more than there is currently.Ensom (p.63) The first chalk deposits contained sands and grits thought to have originated in Cornubia. This gritty chalk was deposited across central Dorset and can clearly be seen in the sides of Eggardon Hill. As the water deepened, plankton, coccoliths and foraminifera became the main source for the calcereous soup which would later form the Dorset chalk. The chalk forms a narrow strip inland between Studland and Worbarrow Bay when it reaches the coast once more. A much wider strip continues westward along the coast until it meets the wide swathe of chalk that cuts north-west across the county and forms the south-east point of the Hampshire Basin.Ensom (p.64) Generally the Dorset chalk is too soft to be used as a building stone except along the Ridgeway where faulting and folding produced a particularly hard variety popularly used by the Romans in their mosaics. The chalk often contains larger fossils including ammonites, belemnites and brachiopods. Flint occurs throughout in both nodule and tabular layers. The iridium rich layer of sediment, found around the world at the K-Pg boundary, is missing in Dorset. This may be due to the uplift and erosion that removed the upper layers of the chalk.Ensom (p.66) The sediments resting on the Dorset chalk are, for the same reason, distinctly different from those in other parts of the world, and the remains of the plants and animals within, much more recent.Ensom (p.68) Paleogene and Neogene 65‚Äì40 Ma (Paleocene ‚Äì Eocene) doline on Briantspuddle Heath The expansion of the North Atlantic, which first occurred during the Triassic period, now reached a point where it was affecting the Dorset landscape. Areas that were previously underwater were exposed to erosion as the chalk was folded and forced upwards.Ensom (p.69) The early deposits from this period, found across South-East England, do not occur in Dorset. The small amounts found in Devon however, coupled with the many solution holes found across the Dorset chalk, suggests that erosion may have removed them.Ensom (pp.69‚Äì70) Some of the larger solution holes, known as dolines, are found on the heaths between Dorchester and Bere Regis. Near Briantspuddle is Culpepper's Dish, 86 metres wide and over 21 metres deep.Ensom (p.70) The first deposits found from this period in Dorset are the Reading Formation clays. A sub-division of the Lambeth Group, they are visible above the chalk at Studland. Mottled, brightly coloured and generally lacking fossils, the clays are thought to be deposited beneath lagoons. In the east of the county, however, fossilised remains of gastropods and sharks' teeth have been found alongside flint pebbles, clearly identifying these clays as marine deposits.Ensom (p.71) The Bracklesham Group, found across much of the Dorset portion of the Hampshire Basin, were mainly deposited by rivers and form the foundations of the Dorset heathland. The frequent and heavy rains which occurred during this period transported large amounts of material from northern uplands across the Purbeck and Weymouth areas. A thick layer of Chert gravel from the Purbeck Strata can be found on Blackdown Hill near Portesham, but it is not known whether it was carried there or whether it is the remains of an earlier deposit.Ensom (pp.71‚Äì72) Blocks of Quartzite can be found across the downlands of Southern Dorset and these sarsens have been used in some of the local prehistoric monuments.Ensom (p.71) To the north and east of the county, much finer sands and gravels are found, including ball clay which was widely mined on the heaths around Wareham.Ensom (p.72) The fine particles which make up the clay are believed to have originated in the west where rocks were being broken down by the alternating dry, humid conditions and torrential rain, which in turn formed rivers and carried the material to its current position. Overlying the clay is the Agglestone grit, an iron cemented sandstone which forms the Agglestone near Studland, and has been used in the buildings in and around the heathland where it is found.Ensom (p.73) The crumpled rock strata at Stair Hole caused by a collision between the African and Eurasian plates Fossilised palms taken from the cliffs at Bournemouth confirm that Dorset had a tropical climate at the time. Creech Barrow Hill is crowned with a unique early Eocene limestone that has yielded some important fossils. Outcrops of rock from the Barton Group occur along the coast between Bournemouth and Hengistbury Head.Ensom (p.74) 45‚Äì1.5 Ma (Eocene ‚Äì Pleistocene) During this period, Dorset drifted a further 9 degrees north, the climate cooled rapidly and by 37 Ma was temperate.Ensom (p.75) Mainly terrestrial with fresh and brackish water environments, the county would, despite its low-lying nature, remain largely without marine influences except for some minor incursions at the end of the ice ages. The late Palaeogene deposits that filled the Hampshire Basin as the sea levels fell are not found in Dorset, nor are the Neogene, which are absent from virtually all of the British Isles. The collision of the African and Eurasian plates that occurred around this time caused a violent uplift in the south of the county, the results of which can be seen clearly at Stair Hole, where the strata run almost vertically.Ensom (pp.75‚Äì76) Further, but less dramatic folding and uplift, along the county's subsurface faults, coupled with continuing erosion of Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments, created Dorset's modern landscape and drainage patterns.Ensom (p.76) Quaternary 1.5 Ma‚ÄìPresent (Pleistocene ‚Äì Holocene) White Hole, Portland During the last 1,500,000 years, Britain was subjected to a number of extreme fluctuations in temperature which included three ice ages. Dorset was not affected by glaciation but did experience very low temperatures with permafrost on the high ground.Ensom (pp.77 ‚Äì 78) Sudden changes in sea-level, and successive warming and cooling, took their toll on the landscape.Ensom (p.77) The two raised beaches at Portland created 210,000 and 125,000 years ago are a dramatic testament to the fluctuations in sea levels. The cause of these two fluctuations was twofold: the growth of the ice, which absorbed large quantities of water, and the weight of the ice in the north that caused the landmass to tilt.Ensom (p.78) During the summer months, partial melting of the ice created large rivers that washed enormous amounts of sand and gravel across the county, forming huge terraces in both the upland areas and valleys.Ensom (p.78) These rivers cut down into the landscape as they made their way to the lower sea levels. This action caused many large-scale landslips, most notably around Shaftesbury and Abbotsbury. Landslips caused by marine erosion still occur today, with some of the largest taking place along the West Dorset Coast. Fossilised remains, including the teeth and tusks of elephants and mammoths dating back 500,000 years, are often exposed.Ensom (p.79) Flint and Chert tools from early human visitors have been retrieved from the river terraces around the Dorset and Devon border, although these may have been transported here with the other river deposits. Chesil Bank a long barrier beach stretching from West Bay to Portland, was created 10,000 years ago, when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age. Structure Vertical rock strata on the west side of St Oswald's Bay, at the western end of the Purbeck Monocline Structural development The Variscan orogeny is the oldest event for which there is evidence in Dorset, forming a major series of thrust faults in Carboniferous and older rocks. These thrusts trend west‚Äìeast, dip moderately towards the south and have controlled later basin development and subsequent phases of inversion. During the Permo-Triassic the area was affected by a phase of rifting that reactivated the older thrusts in extension. These extensional faults were themselves reactivated during further rifting in Jurassic to early Cretaceous times. The area experienced the effects of the early stages of Alpine collision during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene, with reverse reactivation of many of the extensional faults, creating the most visible of the structures in the Dorset area, such as the Purbeck Monocline. Litton Cheney Fault The Litton Cheney Fault is a west‚Äìeast-trending, south-dipping normal fault. The fault was active during deposition of the Lias Group and again during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. There is evidence of minor reversal on the fault during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene inversion. Abbotsbury‚ÄìRidgeway Fault This major west‚Äìeast-trending, south-dipping normal fault was mainly active during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, as shown by the local preservation of the Wealden in its hanging wall. It was reactivated as a reverse fault during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene, and now juxtaposes Portland and Purbeck beds in the hanging wall against Chalk in the footwall. The fault is not directly linked to faults beneath the Triassic salt layer. 260px Weymouth Anticline The Weymouth Anticline has a west‚Äìeast trending axis and plunges to the east. Strata beneath the Upper Triassic halite are unfolded indicating that the salt is acting as a decollement. The anticline is a result of inversion along the Abbotsbury‚ÄìRidgeway Fault, although it has been suggested that it developed by the tightening of an earlier rollover anticline, formed during an earlier extensional phase, due to the soft-linked nature of the faulting. Purbeck Monocline This monoclinal structure forms part of a semi-continuous structure extending eastwards through the Isle of Wight as the Portland-Wight Monocline (or Disturbance). This was formed by reverse reactivation of the Purbeck‚ÄìIsle of Wight fault zone.

The company purchases loans from agricultural lenders, and sells instruments backed by those loans. The company also works with the United States Department of Agriculture. It is based in Washington, D.C. History It was created by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 () as a federally chartered, private corporation responsible for guaranteeing the timely repayment of principal and interest to investors in a new agricultural secondary market. The secondary market allows a lending institution to sell a qualified farm real estate loan to an agricultural mortgage marketing facility, or pooler, which packages these loans, and sells to investors securities that are backed by, or represent interests in, the pooled loans. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on these securities and, under authorities granted in 1995, can also serve as a loan pooler. The company was founded in the midst of a $4 billion bailout of the Farm Credit System, hoping to provide an alternative source of credit to farmers following the models of Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae. Financial crisis of 2008 In June 2008, Farmer Mac had $47.2 million invested in Fannie Mae shares. Over the next few months, in the wake of the Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these investments lost about $44 million in value. The company also had significant investments in the newly-bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings. In response, the Farm Credit System bailed the company out by purchasing $60 million in Farmer Mac stock, and Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City purchased another $5 million in stock.

She was launched on 31 October 1981 sponsored by Mrs. Caspar Weinberger, and commissioned on 21 May 1983, with Commander Kenneth R. Karr in command. With the second Commanding Officer, Alfred Ponessa, Norfolk conducted extensive trials of the next-generation torpedo, ADCAP, as well as advanced and secret acoustic experiments. The ship also made an active deployment during one of the final spurts of activity from the declining Soviet navy. On 23 July 1988 Norfolk fired the first ADCAP torpedo, sinking the ex-. Commander Ponessa was succeeded by Commander Harrop in 1988. On 17 January 1989, Norfolk collided with the combat stores ship in the Thimble Shoals channel as both vessels were headed to sea. Norfolk struck her starboard side into the port side of San Diego. There were no injuries, but both ships suffered damage. Norfolks commanding officer was subsequently relieved of command. The sub made a surface transit to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay for drydocking and repairs within a few days,http://www.uscarriers.net/ssn714history.htm and San Diego required dry dock repairs that were completed 10 April 1989. As a result of this collision, COMSUBLANT issued orders limiting submarine speed and passing activities while in the restricted waters of the Hampton Roads channels.

The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 23 February 1976, and her keel was laid down on 25 January 1980. She was launched on 8 May 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Joanne Kemp, wife of former Buffalo Bills quarterback and New York's 31st congressional district representative Jack Kemp, who was credited with winning approval to name the ship after the city in his district. Buffalo was commissioned on 5 November 1983, with Commander G. Michael Hewitt in command. Buffalo was decommissioned on 30 January 2019 after 35 years of service. Operational history 1980s Upon commissioning, Buffalo was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1984, after a five-month post-shakedown maintenance availability, Buffalo transited through the Panama Canal during a change of homeport to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1. Buffalo completed her first deployment to the Western Pacific in 1985, where she became the first nuclear- powered submarine to anchor off the coast of Pattaya Beach, Thailand. Buffalo's second Western Pacific deployment came in 1987, after which she was awarded her first Battle Effectiveness Award, which she proceeded to win for three consecutive years. She conducted another Western Pacific deployment from late 1988 to early 1989. 1990s After conducting Western and Eastern Pacific deployments in 1990, the next year Buffalo entered dry-dock in Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and began a yearlong Depot Modernization Period during which she was temporarily assigned to Submarine Squadron 7. In the following years, Buffalo conducted numerous deployments to the Eastern and Western Pacific, earning a CNO Letter of Commendation for her 1997 deployment. Buffalo conducted the first-ever dual Selected Restricted Availability, sharing a dry- dock with the USS Los Angeles (SSN-688) in 1998, followed by an Eastern Pacific deployment that included special Joint Operations with the United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard, for which she was awarded the Coast Guard Special Operations Ribbon. In 1999, she conducted another Western Pacific deployment, earning the Battle \\"E\\" again, which occurred again in 2001. 2000s In 2002, Buffalo entered dry-dock in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and became the first ship to undergo the multi-year nuclear refueling process in Hawaii. In late November 2005, the DDS was used to launch an underwater glider capable of gathering and storing information to be later transmitted using a built-in satellite phone. Operations in Guam Buffalo changed homeport again in 2007 to Naval Base Guam, where she operated out of Apra Harbor assigned to Submarine Squadron 15 as one of the Navy's most forward- deployed submarine assets. While stationed in Guam, she conducted 11 missions vital to national security and visited Australia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Saipan, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand. She won numerous awards including three Battle \\"E\\" awards, the prestigious Pacific Fleet Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. 2010s Return to Hawaii After five and a half years in Guam, Buffalo returned to Pearl Harbor in early 2013, rejoining Submarine Squadron 1. After completing a 17-month Pre-Inactivation Restricted Availability, on 23 December 2016 Buffalo completed her final Western Pacific deployment prior to scheduled decommissioning, for which she earned a Navy Unit Commendation. On 1 May 2017, Buffalo departed Pearl Harbor for the final time. Inactivation and decommissioning Per the Annual Report to Congress on Long-Range Planning for Construction of Naval Vessels for FY2013, Buffalo was originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2017. On 26 May 2017, Buffalo arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Friday for inactivation and decommissioning. Buffalo was officially placed in reserve status, inactivated but in commission on 30 September 2017. On 16 July 2018, Buffalo conducted her inactivation ceremony, the final public event prior to the ship's official decommissioning, which will occur within the access-controlled Puget Sound Naval Shipyard sometime in February 2019. Buffalo was decommissioned on 30 January 2019 and is currently pending disposal.

The two-seat R22 was designed in 1973 by Frank Robinson and has been in production since 1979. Development The majority of flight testing was performed at Zamperini Field in Torrance, California. Flight testing and certification was performed in the late 1970s by test pilot Joseph John \\"Tym\\" Tymczyszyn and the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979. Due to relatively low acquisition and operating costs, the R22 has been popular as a primary rotorcraft trainer around the world and as a livestock management tool on large ranches in North America and cattle stations in Australia. The R22 has a very low inertia rotor systemGreenspun, Philip. \\"2005 Robinson R22 - owner's review \\" March 2010. Accessed: 20 September 2014. and the control inputs are operated directly by push rods with no hydraulic assistance. Thus, the flight controls are very sensitive and require a light touch to avoid over correcting. A student that masters an R22 generally does not have a problem transitioning to a heavier helicopter. Due to the issues relating to a low inertia rotor system and a teetering main rotor, operation by any pilot in the United States of the Robinson R22 or Robinson R44 requires a special endorsement by a certified flight instructor.SFAR No. 73 to Part 61 in the Federal Aviation Regulations Tip weights were added to increase rotor inertia, but the small rotor limits weight.Borrows, David A. Rotor RPM Flight Training, March 1998. Accessed: February 2011. Design Robinson R22 hovering The R22 is a light, two-place, single reciprocating-engined helicopter with a semi-rigid two-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor has a teetering hinge and two coning hinges. The tail rotor has only a teetering hinge. The normal production variant has skid landing gear. The Mariner version ‚Äî which is no longer manufactured ‚Äî provided floats. Wheeled gear is not available. The basic structure is welded chromoly steel tubing. The forward fuselage is made of fiberglass and aluminum with a Plexiglas canopy. The tailcone and vertical and horizontal stabilizers are aluminum. It has an enclosed cabin with side- by-side seating for a pilot and passenger. The doors may be removed for flight, as is often done for photographic flights, interior cooling in high temperatures, or a 10.4 lb weight saving. The first version was produced as the R22, followed by the R22 HP, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, and R22 Beta II. Superficially, the aircraft appear similar. The R22 HP was fitted with a 160 bhp Lycoming O-320-B2C engine, an increase of over the original R22. The steel tube frame on the R22 Alpha was modified by extending the aft landing gear mounting points, giving the ship a slightly nose-down attitude on the ground and better matching of the skids to the ground in a low altitude hover with two people on board. The R22 Beta added an engine speed governor (optional), rotor brake, and auxiliary fuel tank (optional). The battery was moved from below the instrument cluster to the engine compartment for better balance. The R22 has been offered as an instrument trainer version, with optional fixed floats as the R22 Mariner, and other special configurations for police work, electronic news gathering, and so on. The R22 Beta II received a larger Lycoming O-360 engine de-rated for sea level operation. It allows greater altitudes for hovering in and out of ground effect (HIGE/HOGE). The R22 Beta II also made the engine speed governor standard and included a carburetor heat assist which correlates adding carburetor heat with decrease in collective control. Only the basic skid style is currently being sold. Controls The R22's cockpit, showing its unique \\"T-Bar\\" control Instead of floor-mounted cyclic sticks between the pilot's knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering \\"T-Bar\\" control connected to a stick that emerges from the console between the seats. This makes it easier for occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury in the event of a hard landing. The teetering bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots' legs. Thus, if teetered to the right, the right side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12 inches above the left pilot's lap. R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air. The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail rotor pedals can be removed if the left seat occupant is not certified to fly the R22 or if the space is needed for technical or observer duties. A floor-mounted foot-activated push- to-talk switch facilitates intercom communications for the left seat occupant, although some later models may be equipped with a voice activated intercom system. The helicopter rotor system consists of a two-bladed main rotor and two-bladed anti-torque rotor on the tail, each equipped with a teetering hinge. The main rotor is also equipped with two coning hinges. Collective and cyclic pitch inputs to the main rotor are transmitted through pushrods and a conventional swashplate mechanism. Control inputs to the pre-coned tail rotor are transmitted through a single pushrod inside the aluminum tail cone. To ease the pilot's workload, a mechanical throttle correlator adjusts the throttle as the collective pitch control is raised or lowered. The pilot needs to make only small adjustments by twisting the throttle grip on the collective throughout the flight regime. Later models are also equipped with an electronic governor which works to maintain RPM within normal operating limits (between 97% and 104% RPM); the governor is active when the engine is running only above 80% RPM, and is most effective in normal flight conditions. The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located at the end of the pilot's collective pitch control. When the governor is not engaged, a yellow caution light glows on the instrument panel. Powerplant Lycoming O-320 mounted in a Robinson R22 Beta The R22 is a simple and tight design The R22 uses a horizontally mounted Lycoming O-320 (O-360-J2A on the Beta II), flat-four, air-cooled, normally aspirated, carburetor-equipped reciprocating engine. It is fueled with 100LL grade aviation gasoline. Cooling is provided through a direct drive squirrel-cage cooling fan. At sea level it is derated, or operated at less than maximum power, which has been attributed to the company wishing for the power unit to maintain the same performance at sea level as it does at altitude. As the air becomes thinner with increasing altitude, maximum available horsepower decreases, reaching a point where the throttle can be completely open and rotor RPM is controlled by collective lever position. By derating the engine at sea level, the R22 achieves acceptable high-altitude performance without use of supercharging or turbocharging, thus saving the weight, cost, complexity, unreliability, and shortened engine life of a forced induction system. A carburetor is used to provide the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most likely to occur in conditions of a low 11 ¬∞C (20 ¬∞F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the \\"dew point spread\\"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control is used to supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a \\"carburetor heat assist\\" which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective lever is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in Hg (457 mm Hg) of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in Hg of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH). Power is transmitted from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave by means of a belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash- lubricated spiral bevel gears. A one-way sprag clutch is built into the center of the upper sheave to allow the rotor system to continue to rotate in the event of engine failure, allowing the R22 to enter autorotation and land in a controlled manner. Because the main rotor has very little mass and inertia, autorotation in an R22 requires careful and proper execution to assure a successful outcome. Much time is spent in training practicing various types of autorotation. Target speed in an autorotation is and the glide ratio is approximately 4:1 in maximum-glide configuration. Transport Robinson R22 helicopter on a trailer The two-bladed rotor and the small size of the R22 make it possible to transport the helicopter without blade folding or dismantling tasks. Transporting the R22 requires securing the tail boom and rotor blades to a truck or trailer bed, which must be torsionally rigid to prevent motion and stresses being applied to the helicopter during transportation. It is possible to take off from and land directly onto a trailer.

In 2003 the United States Navy purchased four aircraft, equipped with Wescam EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infrared) systems. Boeing then modified one of the Mavericks further, calling it the Renegade, under contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as a research testbed to develop software for its A160 Hummingbird. The software system, known as the Software Enabled Control (SEC) program, was developed by Boeing and teams from the University of California, Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was first flown on May 26, 2005.

In Australia, where there are 489 R22s registered as of mid-2011, a survey found that 62% of the fleet's flying time was in mustering operations, while 13% of hours were spent in training pilots. Many broadcasters used the R22 until the mid-1990s when the financial landscape of radio broadcasting in the U.S. changed due to deregulation of the industry.  Military  ; * Dominican Republic Army ; * Philippine Navy  Accidents and incidents  Since the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979, Robinson has delivered 4620 R22 helicopters. The R22 had 182 fatal accidents between March 1979 and June 2010 from a total of 1230 incidents. In late 1981, the R22 had its type certificate temporarily revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration due to delamination of a main rotor blade. The cause of the delamination was determined to be contamination of one of the bonded parts during a priming operation performed at an outside vendor. In response, Robinson Helicopter Company instituted stringent quality procedures and requirements, and replaced all main rotor blades on the fleet of 33 helicopters in service at the time.Krauss, Barbara. (1986, July/August). Robinson Helicopter: Number two and trying harder. Vertiflite, Volume 32, p 24 In the early 1980s, the R22 experienced a number of student-pilot related accidents due to the R22's use as a primary flight trainer. Believing the number of accidents was the result of insufficient training and lax standards, Robinson established the Robinson Pilot Safety Course in 1982 to educate Certified Flight Instructors transitioning from larger helicopters to the new, smaller R22.Ells, Steven W. (2007, June 1) The highest standards: Robinson Helicopter aims for excellence. AOPA Pilot. After the introduction of the Robinson Pilot Safety Course, the rate of fatal R22 accidents declined from 3.7 per 100,000 flight hours in 1983 to 0.97 per 100,000 flight hours for the 12 months preceding July 1995.Campbell, J.R. \\"Zoom\\".

The house that Frank built. Vertiflite, Volume 59, p. 25 R22 Cost The R22 has a suggested retail price of $285,000 (ex factory price, USA) and the value on the second hand market is dependent on component time in service. Operating cost, per the factory, including insurance, reserve for overhaul, and direct operating cost (fuel, oil, inspections, unscheduled maintenance) is US$143.59/hr. A full overhaul of major components is required at 2200 hours (or 12 years, whichever comes first), which is sometimes known as \\"Timex\\" Depreciation on a Robinson R22 is negligible, as freshly overhauled R22s typically sell for more than the original cost. However, a provision per flown hour must be made for a \\"reserve for overhaul\\" cost, currently estimated at US$65.33 per hour. (Total approximate overhaul cost: ~$60 x 2200 Hours = ~US$132,700) The Robinson price list is updated in February each year.

He is best known for designing the Crampton locomotive but had many engineering interests including the electric telegraph and the Channel Tunnel for which he designed a boring machine. His locomotives had much better success in France, Germany and Italy than they did in the UK. Personal life Born to John and Mary Crampton of Prospect Cottage (in what is now Dickens Walk), Broadstairs, on 6 August 1816, Crampton was the son of a plumber and architect. He was educated privately. Crampton married Louisa Martha Hall, who was a singer and a friend of Jenny Lind, on 25 February 1841. They had 8 children, six boys and two girls. The eldest girl, Ada Sarah, died aged 4 on 16 February 1857. and Crampton gifted a stained glass window in St. Peter's church, Broadstairs in her memory. Their youngest daughter, Louisa, was to marry Sir Horace Rumbold, the Ambassador to the Netherlands. He died at his home, 19 Ashley Place, Westminster on 19 April 1888 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Career Crampton entered a career in engineering, initially with Marc Brunel and later with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in Swindon. Great Western Railway 1839-43 Crampton worked as assistant to Marc Brunel and on joining the GWR in 1839, then Daniel Gooch. Crampton was involved in the design of the \\"Firefly\\" class of locomotives. Gooch's aim was to produce broad gauge locomotives that were better than those on the standard gauge lines, thus proving the broad gauge system was the better technically. Crampton, unbeknown to the GWR, had the idea of improving standard gauge locomotives so that they could match those of the broad gauge. In 1843, he left the GWR. Development 1844-51 1846 Crampton locomotiveCrampton realised that the locomotives of the GWR were better than the standard gauge locomotives for a number of reasons. The broad gauge allowed a larger boiler diameter and higher centre of gravity for the same stability. Broad gauge also allowed a bigger firebox and heating area. Larger driving wheels gave a lower piston speed, which allowed a higher speed for the locomotive before exhaust problems occurred. In 1843, Crampton took out a patent for a new design of locomotive. It is for the physical appearance of his locomotives that Crampton is remembered for today, with the driving wheel placed behind the firebox. But there were technical improvements that he made, which laid the foundations for future locomotive design. The three most important improvements were:- wide steam passages, large heating surfaces and generous bearing surfaces on the wheels. From 1844 to 1848, Crampton was working for John and George Rennie. In 1845, Crampton received his first order for a locomotive built to his patent. The Namur and Liege Railway in Belgium ordered three locomotives with diameter driving wheels and a grate. They were built by the firm of Tulk and Ley of Whitehaven. One of the locomotives was tested in 1847 on the London and North Western Railway, who then built a \\"Crampton Patent\\" locomotive at Crewe. Another two locomotives were bought by the LNWR, including a 6-2-0 Liverpool built by Bury, Curtis and Kennedy in 1848 with diameter driving wheels. A claim of being achieved was made, with an average of over with a 60-ton load. Another claim was for a speed of hauling eight carriages over at an average speed of . One locomotive Crampton designed had an indirect drive arrangement, with a crankshaft between the driving wheels. This locomotive had a 2-2+2-2 wheel arrangement. In 1847, Crampton became a founder member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and in 1848, Crampton set up in business as a Civil Engineer in London. In 1850, a Crampton locomotive was exhibited at Birmingham which had balance weights on the driving wheels. This feature was commented upon by William Stroudley. In 1851, Crampton started the Broadstairs Gasworks, overseeing the construction and financing much of the works. South Eastern Railway 1851-88 No. 136 Folkstone at The Great Exhibition, 1851 Crampton's water tower, BroadstairsBy 1851, Crampton was working for the South Eastern Railway (SER). In that year, ten new Crampton locomotives were built, and one of these, No.136 Folkstone was exhibited at The Great Exhibition. In 1854, Crampton became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and in 1855 he was responsible for the building of the Berlin waterworks. (a photo of Crampton is here) In 1856, Crampton was appointed to the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. In 1859, Crampton formed the Broadstairs Water Company, building a water tower high which now forms the Crampton Tower Museum. The water tower could hold of water. Broadstairs Water Company was taken over by Broadstairs Urban District Council in 1901. In 1860, Crampton designed a tower for Holy Trinity church, Broadstairs, which Dickens had described as a \\"hideous temple of flint, a petrified haystack\\". Crampton donated a clock as a personal gift to the church. he also donated a wrought iron bridge which was built across Goodson Steps. This is the Louisa Gap bridge, named after his youngest daughter. Crampton was elected Vice-President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1883. Peto, Betts and Crampton Crampton entered a partnership with Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts to undertake part of the construction of the London Chatham and Dover Railway. When the partnership became insolvent in 1867, Crampton was made personally bankrupt,The Morning Post, 23 July 1868. but, unlike Peto and Betts, managed to retain his good reputation and continue in business. Railway lines constructed Crampton was, wholly or partly, responsible for the railway lines built between Smyrna and Aidin; Varna and Rustchuk; Strood and Dover; Sevenoaks and Swanley; and Herne Bay and Faversham. The latter three lines being built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). Crampton was also the contractor, and later chairman of the East and West Junction Railway. A Crampton locomotive was used to haul the first train from Kineton to Fenny Compton. Crampton was a partner in the Mont Cenis Pass RailwayP. J. G. Ransom (1999), The Mont Cenis Fell Railway, pp 30-32, Truro: Twelveheads Press Electric telegraph Crampton was responsible for the laying of the first international submarine cable in the world. This was laid in the Strait of Dover in 1851. The first messages were carried on 13 November 1851 and the cable was in use until 1859. The company behind the project was an Anglo-French undertaking, known as la Compagnie du t√©l√©graphe sous-marin in France and the Submarine Telegraph Company between France and England in Great Britain. Crampton was the engineer, and Charlton Wollaston was the electrician involved in laying the cable across the Channel. The SER were another early user of the electric telegraph, and it was by use of the SER's wires that messages were able to be transmitted between Paris and London, being relayed from Dover. Channel Tunnel Crampton designed an automatic hydraulic tunnel boring machine, which was intended to be used in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. Modern drilling techniques were made possible by this invention. Family Crampton's first wife died on 16 March 1875 and he married Elizabeth Werge on 25 August 1881. He left six sons and one daughter, who married Sir Horace Rumbold, ambassador at Vienna.

The contract to build it was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 13 August 1981 and its keel was laid down on 4 January 1984. It was launched on 2 November 1985 sponsored by Mrs. Linda M. Nickles, and commissioned on 9 July 1988, with Commander Kevin John Reardon in command. In 1991, Oklahoma City won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 November 2002, Oklahoma City collided with the Leif Hoegh liquefied natural gas tanker Norman Lady, east of the Strait of Gibraltar. No one on either vessel was hurt, and there were no leaks of oil from fuel tanks and no threat to the environment, but the submarine sustained damage to its periscope and sail area, and put into La Maddalena, Sardinia, for repairs. Its commanding officer, Commander Richard Voter, was relieved of his command on 30 November. One other officer and two enlisted crew members also were disciplined for dereliction of duty. On 20 January 2005 Oklahoma City returned to Norfolk, Virginia, after a six-month deployment in support of national security interests and the War on Terrorism. OKC transited to its patrol area in the Pacific Ocean via the Arctic Ocean, the first such transit for a second-flight . After the patrol, it then completed a circumnavigation of North America by transiting back to the Atlantic Ocean through the Panama Canal and returning to its home port in Norfolk. In early 2007, Oklahoma City became the first submarine certified to exclusively use Digital Nautical Charts (DNCs), using the Voyage Management System (VMS). VMS is part of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System-Navy (ECDIS-N) system, which has been under development since 1990. The shift from traditional paper navigation to an all-electronic navigation suite marked the first significant shift in U.S. Navy navigation practices since the introduction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1990s. From May to November 2007, Oklahoma City completed a deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of the War on Terror. It spent May to July 2008 in the Eastern Pacific in support of the War on Drugs, and was responsible for seizing more than 11 metric tons of cocaine valued at more than $1.5 billion (USD).

History Early in 1996, an RQ-1 Predator aerial reconnaissance drone was successfully controlled from Chicago. The drone reached altitudes up to 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) and ranged up to 185 kilometers (100 nmi.) from the submarine, which was operating at periscope depth. In the summer of 2005, Chicago tested the virtual periscope, a system that would allow submerged submarines to observe the surface above them without having to come to a shallower depth, as is required by traditional periscopes. After completing a two-year maintenance and upgrade period at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in October 2011, Chicago arrived in April 2012 at her new homeport, assigned to Submarine Squadron 15, based at Joint Region Marianas on the island of Guam. In keeping with a tradition that dates back to World War II, Richard O'Kane's cribbage board was transferred from the Olympia's Wardroom to the Chicago's when the Olympia was decommissioned on 31 October 2019.

She had been operating as part of Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8),Eisenhower Strike Group Completes JTFEX 06-2 organized around the aircraft carrier . The Carrier Strike Group was redeploying to the Indian Ocean to support a maritime cordon during the war in Somalia when the incident happened. Newport News suffered damage to her bow, but there was no damage to the sail, mast or reactor, and she made for port in Bahrain under her own power. Newport News was escorted from the mouth of the Straits of Hormuz to Bahrain by the Guided Missile Destroyer . This was due to the fact that the submarine was unable to transit submerged and has no surface defense capabilities. During the transit, Iranian aircraft and warships shadowed the ships. An official of the Kawasaki Kisen Company (or K Line), which owns the tanker, announced that Mogamigawas hull and propellers were damaged. According to a Navy spokesman, the collision occurred as a result of the venturi effect. The tanker drove over the area where the submarine was submerged and this created a sucking effect that forced the submarine upward to the surface. The incident was the third collision between a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and a Japanese civilian ship. On 29 January, after the boat returned to Bahrain for repairs, administrative personnel actions (Admiral's Mast) were taken against several members of her crew, which included relieving the boat's commanding officer, Commander Matthew A. Weingart, of command due to a lack of confidence in his ability to command. On 10 April the Iranian Fars News Agency reported that Newport News has been leaking radioactive and chemical pollution in the Persian Gulf and claimed that following this formal complaint, the ship departed the gulf for a complete overhaul. (Note that the image accompanying the FARS article is not a Los Angeles class submarine.) The US Navy Fifth Fleet denied this claim restating that damage was limited to the bow and that the sail, mast and reactors were not damaged. On 2 October 2007 the U.S. Navy agreed to pay Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, the company that owns Mogamigawa an undisclosed amount in compensation for the collision.

Pasadena provides the Fleet Commander or Task Force Commander a multi-mission platform. This vessel has unlimited endurance due to the nuclear propulsion plant, advanced sonar, torpedo, cruise missile, and mine delivery systems, a combination of speed and stealth due to quieting and the capacity to fulfill numerous missions. History The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 30 November 1982 and her keel was laid down on 20 December 1985. She was launched on 12 September 1987 sponsored by Mrs. Pauline Trost, and commissioned on 11 February 1989 with Commander W. Fritchman in command. Originally assigned to Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Pasadena conducted an inter-fleet transfer in October 1990 to the Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and was homeported in San Diego, California. In July 1991, Pasadena became the first Improved 688 Class submarine to deploy, commencing a six-month Western Pacific deployment. In June 1993, she commenced a six-month Western Pacific deployment to the Persian Gulf. While deployed, Pasadena participated in several exercises with the Royal Saudi, Omani and Australian Navies, and was the first United States SSN to conduct exercises with the Indian Navy in MALABAR Naval Exercise. She also became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on the Red Sea. In March 1995, Pasadena again deployed on a six-month Western Pacific Deployment. While deployed to the Persian Gulf she became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of Muscat, Oman; the first to operate continuously inside the Persian Gulf; and the first SSN to be assigned to Commander, U.S. Fifth Fleet. In April 1996, Pasadena changed homeports to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron Seven. From June 1996 to September 1996, Pasadena underwent a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) where she was outfitted with improved offensive and defensive weapon systems. In April 1997, Pasadena deployed to the Eastern Pacific for a four-month deployment in support of UNITAS. In January 2005, she participated in Operation Unified Assistance. From September 2011 until late 2013, Pasadena was refitted at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.Associated Press, \\"Submarine Pasadena arrives at Portsmouth\\", Military Times, 21 September 2011. Her sonar, fire-control system, and navigation equipment were upgraded. Following the update, Pasadena joined her new posting, Submarine Squadron 11 in San Diego, in November 2013. Following an intense workup from November 2013 until December 2014, USS Pasadena deployed to the Western Pacific for 6 months in January 2015. The deployment was highly successful and saw Pasadena conduct port visits in Yokosuka, Japan; Sasebo, Japan; Busan, South Korea; Singapore and Guam.

The turtle pugilist ties SSN-752 to , a World War II light cruiser that earned six battle stars. The emblem for CL-65 was created for the cruiser by Walt Disney. Coincidentally, during the sub's construction at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, CT, the crew adopted a North American Snapping Turtle as a mascot. The creature actually rode the boat into the Thames river during its launching. By the time construction was over, the turtle, named Frumpy, which originally fit into the palm of a hand, was over 18 inches long, forcing the crew to find a new home. Cal Poly in Pomona proved a willing host. To get Frumpy to the new abode, two crew members: ET1(SS) Del Laughery, and ET1(SS) Don Hilliker, both pilots, flew the turtle in a private aircraft from Groton to Pomona.

Operational history Columbus completed a Post Shipyard Availability in June 1994 in Groton, Connecticut after initial construction and shakedown operations. In September 1994, the submarine conducted an interfleet transfer to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. Columbus deployed to the Western Pacific in late 1995 through early 1996 and conducted a variety of operations as a unit of the Seventh Fleet along the way making port visits in Hong Kong, Subic Bay, Guam, and Yokosuka, Japan. Columbus was the first submarine equipped with the BYG-1 Fire Control System in December 2002. Two successful test launches of Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) cruise missiles were conducted in late May 2003 from Columbus, while underway in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. Columbus departed Pearl Harbor for another western Pacific deployment in late 2003, and visited Jinhae-gu, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan while taking part in Annual-Ex 2003, an exercise with various units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. In mid-April 2006 seven Columbus crewmen were charged with a variety of offenses, including assault, dereliction of duty, and hazing, for alleged attacks on two of their shipmates. The accused range from a petty officer third class (E-4) to a senior chief (E-8)Navy Times. A complete report on the situation was completed on 30 May. On 13 June, the Navy announced the dismissal of Columbuss commanding officer, Commander Charles Marquez because of concerns about his \\"ability to establish and maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct, provide the crew a safe, positive, professional environment in which to work, and maintain good order and discipline\\"Seattle Post-IntelligencerSeattle Post-Intelligencer. Captain Brian McIlvaine, former commanding officer of , replaced Marquez temporarily. After a few months in command CAPT McIlvaine was replaced with CDR James Doody. At the end of a DMP (depot modernization period) In Bremerton, Washington, Columbus relocated back to Pearl Harbor on December 22, 2006. Following a modernization refit at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 2004-2006 in Bremerton, Washington, Columbus returned to Submarine Squadron Seven in Pearl Harbor. She departed in March 2008 for a regularly scheduled six-month deployment with the Seventh Fleet. Columbus supported national taskings and theater security cooperation efforts while making port visits in Saipan, Guam, Okinawa, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, Japan. In January 2009 Columbus was awarded the Submarine Squadron Seven Battle Efficiency (Battle \\"E\\") award, given to the submarine crew that best demonstrates technical proficiency and continual mission readiness throughout the previous year. In July 2009 Admiral Gary Roughead, the Chief of Naval Operations, announced that Columbus was the Pacific Fleet winner of the 2008 Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy. Columbus returned to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in August 2012 after completing a six-month deployment that included Seventh Fleet and national mission tasking along with port visits to Japan, South Korea, and Guam. Columbus arrived in the South Korean southern port city of Busan on 3 March 2014 as a part of a scheduled deployment in the Western Pacific. In September 2017, Columbus returned to Pearl Harbor from a six-month deployment having performing three national tasking periods, two theater operation periods, and a multinational exercise. Columbus also enjoyed four port visits, including Singapore and Guam.

The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 10 June 1988, and her keel was laid down on 6 May 1991. She was launched on 28 August 1993, sponsored by Mrs. Sabra Smith, and commissioned on 24 February 1995. History Her first deployment was to the Mediterranean with the Carrier Strike Group in 1997‚Äì1998, followed by a six-month tour of the North Atlantic. Kursk incident Toledo and were observing Russian naval exercises in August 2000. There, the Russian cruise missile submarine Kursk suffered a catastrophic incident and sank. Russian Navy officials initially made numerous claims that the sinking of Kursk was caused by a collision with one of the US submarines, though evidence clearly disproved such a theory; the underwater seismic signals recorded matched those of an explosion and not a collision with another vessel, and the US submarines were fully operational after the incident (there is a claim the Toledo would have been severely damaged or sunk by a hypothetical collision, being less than half of Kursk's displacement). However the actual risk of damage or sinking would be defined by the mechanical strength and location of impact points, not the size of the actual vessel. Also, the impact could have caused immediate internal explosion, which would explain the acoustic signature of the first explosion. Nevertheless, the loss of Kursk was officially attributed to a faulty dummy torpedo leaking highly volatile high-test peroxide, setting off a chain reaction that detonated five to seven combat-ready torpedo warheads. Size and mass comparison of Kursk and USS Toledo, which is less than half of Kursks displacement Nonetheless, French filmmaker Jean-Michel Carr√©, in an historical-fiction movie named Kursk: A Submarine in Troubled Waters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vR2MIriTCY Koursk: un sous-marin en eaux troubles 70 mn documentary which aired on 7 January 2005 on French TV channel France 2, alleged that Kursk sank because of a sequence of events triggered by a collision with Toledo. According to Carr√©, Kursk was performing tests with VA-111 Shkval torpedoes and the tests were being observed by two US submarines on duty in the region, Toledo and . 2001-2006 deployments Toledo deployed to the Mediterranean again in late 2001-early 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Toledo returned to the Naval Submarine Base New London in mid-April 2003 after having taken part in the Iraq War. On 7 December 2004, Toledo returned to Groton, Connecticut, after a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf with the Carrier Strike Group that included port calls in Crete, Dubai, and Bahrain. Her route home from Bahrain was unusual, rounding the Cape of Good Hope rather than using the Suez Canal. Once back in the North Atlantic, she was diverted for a classified drug interdiction mission with the Joint Interagency Task Force‚ÄìSouth in the Caribbean Sea. On 31 January 2006, Toledo again departed for a six-month deployment to CENTCOM. Ports of call included Augusta Bay, Sicily, Dubai, the British Indian Ocean Territory of Diego Garcia, and La Maddalena. She returned from this deployment on 31 July 2006. Maintenance 2006‚Äì2009 Northrop Grumman Corporation was awarded a contract from the U.S. Navy for maintenance work, known as a depot modernization period, on Toledo. The initial planning contract was valued at about $34.7 million. The final value, including the actual execution, was $178.5 million. She arrived in December 2006 to Newport News, and the work was completed in March 2009. The project was delayed more than eight months because of more than 2,000 project changes. This was a competitive award under a Naval Sea Systems Command multiple award contract. In July 2009 two hull cracks, including one in her pressure hull, were discovered during a routine inspection. Although the Navy and Northrop Grumman launched two investigations into welding practices at the yard while Toledo was under maintenance, the cracks do not appear to be related to welds. Return to service Toledo left for another six-month deployment on 23 July 2010. In December 2010, she made a port call in Haifa. Commander Reckamp was received by the Haifa City Mayor Yona Yahav in the City Hall as is customary for visiting commanders of warships making port calls in Haifa. On 20 January 2011, Toledo returned to Groton, Connecticut, after a six-month deployment that included port calls in Cyprus, Bahrain, and Haifa. In May 2020, the crew of the Toledo was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for an eight-month intelligence collection deployment.

The ship made port calls in Singapore, Guam, multiple times in Sasebo, Japan, and in Yokosuka, Japan in which she rode out a typhoon while in port. Santa Fe was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, the second highest award given to a submarine, for actions completed on this deployment. She underwent a three-month Interim drydocking in October 2004. After the ship completed sea trials and other various workups she then completed a two-month Eastern Pacific Deployment that started in May 2005. After returning to her homeport of Pearl Harbor in June 2005, she again deployed to the Western Pacific on 9 August 2005. During this deployment she participated in Exercise Malabar with the Indian Navy. Santa Fe was the second U.S. nuclear submarine to participate in the exercise and also to port in Goa, India. After Malabar, the ship made a brief stop in Phuket, Thailand. She was the first U.S. submarine to visit Phuket since 2001. The ship returned to Pearl Harbor in February 2006. She made the transit to the East Coast in July 2006, surfacing near the North Pole on the way and stopping in Brest, France.

She was the third vessel of the U.S. Navy to be named after Miami, Florida. Miami was the forty-fourth Los Angeles-class (688) submarine and the fifth Improved Los Angeles-class (688I) submarine to be built and commissioned. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 28 November 1983 and her keel was laid down on 24 October 1986. She was launched on 12 November 1988 and commissioned on 30 June 1990 with Commander Thomas W. Mader in command. On 1 March 2012, Miami pulled into the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for a scheduled 20-month Engineered Overhaul (EOH) and system upgrades. On 23 May, a shipyard employee started a fire that spread to crew living, command and control, and torpedo spaces. Repairs were initially estimated to require three years and $450 million, a figure that was later revised to a range of $450 million to $700 million. On 6 August 2013, Navy officials said that due to budget cuts the vessel would not be repaired. The submarine was placed on the inactive list, then decommissioned on 28 March 2014. History 1999 Miami became the first submarine to conduct combat operations in two theaters since World War II (Operation Desert Fox and Operation Allied Force). 2012 fire Miami enters dry dock at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 15 March 2012 to begin an engineered overhaul. She was severely damaged by fire two months later. At 5:41 p.m. EDT on 23 May 2012, fire crews were called with a report of a fire on Miami while being overhauled at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. At the time, the submarine was on a scheduled 20-month maintenance cycle, indicating that she was undergoing an extensive overhaul called an \\"Engineering Overhaul\\". The national media reported that seven firefighters had been injured.ABC's Good Morning America 24 May 2012 One crew member suffered broken ribs when he fell through a hole left by removed deck plates during the fire. It took firefighters 12 hours to extinguish it. Originally, the U.S. Navy reported that the fire started when an industrial vacuum cleaner used \\"to clean worksites on the sub after shipyard workers‚Äô shifts\\" sucked up a heat source that ignited debris inside the vacuum. On 23 July 2012, however, civilian painter and sandblaster Casey J. Fury was indicted on two counts of arson after confessing to starting the fire. Fury admitted to setting it by igniting some rags on the top bunk of a bunk room. He claimed to have started it in order to get out of work early. On 15 March 2013, he was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $400 million in restitution. The debate over whether to repair or scrap the submarine lasted more than a year. Within a month of the fire, Maine Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe advocated repairing her. In July 2012, Navy leaders asked Congress to add $220 million to the operations and maintenance budget for emergent and unfunded ship repairs to help repair Miami. In August, the Navy decided to repair the boat for an estimated total cost of $450 million. The repair cost was expected to be trimmed by using spare parts from the recently decommissioned USS and by repairing rather than replacing damaged hull sections, as had been done with another Los Angeles- class boat, . But both of these approaches proved unworkable with the newer Miami. As well, a detailed assessment raised the estimated repair bill to $700 million. On 6 August 2013, the U.S. Navy announced its intention to decommission Miami, concluding the cost was more than it could afford in a time of budget cuts. The sub was officially decommissioned on 28 March 2014, to be disposed of via the nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

CityFlyer's ownership passed to BA in 1999 when that company bought out the original promoters as well as 3i, the airline's main shareholder at the time. Initially, CityFlyer continued to operate as a separate unit, but it was eventually absorbed into British Airways' mainline short haul operation at Gatwick in 2001, the result of a change in British Airways' strategy for its Gatwick operation. Following its absorption into British Airways, the airline's turboprops were retired, while the company's fleet of regional short-haul jetliners and the associated crews were transferred to British Airways' regional operation in Birmingham and Manchester. This in turn resulted in British Airways mainline short haul crews based at Gatwick operating most of the erstwhile CityFlyer Express routes using the former's Gatwick-based Boeing 737 fleet. History Short 360 in Connectair livery ATR 42 in 1993 ATR 42 at D√ºsseldorf Airport in 1993 CityFlyer's origins CityFlyer Express can be traced back to the formation of Connectair in 1983. Connectair became a feeder airline for British Caledonian, at the time the UK's so-called Second Force airline, on 30 May 1984 when it commenced a regional scheduled service between Gatwick and Antwerp with a single, leased Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante turboprop. A small number of larger capacity, more efficient Shorts 330 turboprops eventually replaced the Embraer Bandeirante. There was joint ticketing for both airlines, Connectair flight numbers were prefixed with British Caledonian's BR designator, the two-letter International Air Transport Association code identifying the airline on whose behalf a flight is operated, and all of the company's aircraft were painted in the British Caledonian Commuter livery. However, this relationship stopped short of a franchise agreement. Following British Airways' takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987, Connectair operated its flights under the UK flag carrier's BA designator without adopting the British Airways livery for an interim period. The ILG era In June 1988 the firm was acquired by the International Leisure Group (ILG), the parent company of Air Europe. Following ILG's acquisition of Connectair, the airline was re-branded Air Europe Express and adopted a new corporate identity as of 1 February 1989.It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe., Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 123 ILG's decision to purchase Connectair was part of Air Europe's corporate strategy at the time to establish itself as a major short haul scheduled operator at its Gatwick base. Gatwick had become very busy during the late 1980s. This meant that the much-coveted early-morning peak time slots, which Air Europe needed to be able to operate at times that were attractive to business travellers as well as competitive with its rivals' departure and arrival times, were in increasingly short supply. Connectair held a fairly large number of conveniently timed slots at Gatwick, which it had accumulated since its British Caledonian Commuter days. ILG's acquisition of Connectair therefore represented a golden opportunity to substantially increase the number of slots the group's airlines controlled at Gatwick, thereby strengthening Air Europe's competitive position at that airport. Air Europe Express flew under the same AE airline designator as its bigger sister airline. Its scheduled services initially linked Gatwick with Antwerp and Rotterdam.It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe., Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 122 Larger Shorts 360s gradually replaced the Shorts 330s. In addition, ILG purchased Guernsey Airlines in April 1989, another small, independent regional airline, which operated scheduled services between Guernsey and Gatwick as well as between Guernsey and Manchester at the time.British commuters grow - British Air Ferries/Guernsey Airlines, Flight International, 20 August 1983, p. 498 On 29 October 1989 ILG fully integrated Guernsey Airlines into its existing Air Europe Express operation.It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe., Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, pp. 123/4 These moves provided Air Europe with additional transfer traffic for its developing short haul European scheduled route network. They also enabled Air Europe to launch new routes where there was insufficient traffic to support its larger Boeing 737 and Fokker 100 jet aircraft or where these aircraft were too big to provide a frequent schedule during the start-up phase, such as Gatwick‚ÄîD√ºsseldorf and Gatwick‚ÄîJersey for instance. Following the replacement of the Air Europe Express Shorts 360 turboprops with Air Europe's larger and faster Fokker 100 jets on the Gatwick‚ÄîD√ºsseldorf and Gatwick‚ÄîJersey routes, Air Europe Express launched a new thrice-daily Gatwick‚ÄîBirmingham schedule with its Shorts 360s.It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe., Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 124 During the year ending August 1990 the Air Europe Express operation carried more than a quarter of a million passengers across its route network for the first time. Air Europe Express was forced to halt its operations on 8 March 1991 along with its sister airlines in the ILG- controlled Airlines of Europe group as a result of its parent company's decision to put all the group's companies into administrative receivership on that day, even though Air Europe Express itself had remained profitable throughout that period. A new beginning The management of Air Europe Express quickly started a new airline, Euroworld Airways, and began operations in May 1991 using two Shorts 360 aircraft and staff from the old Air Europe Express. The new carrier also carried on night freight and mail contracts from the defunct airline. The airline soon began flights from Gatwick to Guernsey, Antwerp and Rotterdam, for which two additional Shorts 360s were purchased. At this time, the airline approached several large carriers with a view to establishing a link, but in the event only British Airways was to show any interest, and a code share agreement was struck between the two. Choosing a new corporate identity The airline rebranded as CityFlyer Express in 1992. 1992 also marked CityFlyer's second year of operation, during which it managed to break even for the first time. (It had recorded a loss of ¬£0.5mn in its first year of operation.) From this point onwards, the airline was to post a consistent profit. Launching a new generation of turboprop planes in the UK CityFlyer Express was the UK launch customer for the ATR 42 regional turboprop, acquiring two in 1992. In the same year Aer Lingus abandoned the Gatwick to Dublin service, allowing CityFlyer to step in with a daily service. BA's takeover of Dan-Air also left the Gatwick to Newcastle route vacant for the airline to assume, offering a three-times daily service and requiring a third ATR 42. The addition of D√ºsseldorf to the network in 1993 and a frequency increase on the Dublin route led to the acquisition of a fourth ATR. Formalisation of code-share relationship with British Airways Meanwhile, the code share agreement had resulted in several complaints being lodged with British Airways by customers expecting a BA flight and the BA product. BA proposed a solution to this by offering CityFlyer a franchise agreement, which it accepted. This occasion marked the conclusion of the first-ever franchise agreement between British Airways and another airline. It also marked the conclusion of the first franchise agreement in the UK airline industry. Under this arrangement the CityFlyer aircraft would be painted in full BA livery with interiors and cabin layout conforming to BA's contemporary, standard two- class European product. Staff would wear BA uniforms and all flights would operate under BA flight numbers. British Airways itself would take over CityFlyer's marketing and handle all reservations on its behalf. To all intents and purposes, CityFlyer Express would present itself and trade as British Airways. The deal came into effect in June 1993. Further expansion The franchise agreement allowed CityFlyer Express to take advantage of the UK flag carrier's marketing clout, pricing power as well as its global distribution system (GDS) and worldwide sales force. The airline was again UK launch customer for the larger, 66-seat ATR 72, the first of which was delivered in October 1994. By the end of the 1995 financial year, CityFlyer served ten destinations. Ushering in the jet age CityFlyer Express acquired its first jet aircraft in March 1997 when it became the first UK-based airline to introduce the Avro RJ100. A second Avro RJ100 was acquired in May of that year. Three more were added in 1998 and a further two joined the fleet in 1999. (At the time, the airline also operated six ATR 42s, one of which was returned to its lessor in 1999, as well as five larger ATR 72s. Three additional ATR 72s were delivered in 1999. Eventually, these replaced the remaining ATR 42s.) By the turn of the millennium the company's jet fleet had expanded to 16 RJ100s. Selling out to British Airways With the franchise agreement due to end in 1999, CityFlyer Express was the second largest slot holder at Gatwick Airport (behind British Airways). It held 96 daily slots at Gatwick, employed 677 people and returned a pre-tax profit of ¬£6.4mn on sales of ¬£89.4mn. The airline's shareholders took the opportunity to realise their investment and put the airline up for sale. HSBC was appointed to handle the process, and approached a number of carriers about the sale. Of the airlines approached, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic stated their interest to acquire the airline. At the time Virgin chairman Richard Branson attacked British Airways' intention to bid for CityFlyer Express by claiming publicly that it already had a \\"total monopoly\\" at Heathrow and now wanted a \\"total monopoly\\" at Gatwick as well, thereby undermining its rivals' ability to compete with it on a level playing field. Disregarding a publicly stated offer from Virgin Atlantic to purchase the company for ¬£100mn, HSBC announced the sale of CityFlyer Express to Virgin's arch-rival British Airways for ¬£75mn in November 1998. This immediately caused controversy, with Richard Branson stating that HSBC never responded to Virgin's offer despite numerous requests from Virgin. CityFlyer's management defended its decision to sell to British Airways by stating that it had never received Virgin's bid in the first place. This resulted in the already agreed takeover of CityFlyer Express by British Airways being referred to the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission eventually cleared the sale of CityFlyer Express to British Airways for ¬£75mn in 1999. However, it also imposed a ceiling on the maximum number of slots British Airways and its newly acquired subsidiary CityFlyer Express were allowed to hold at Gatwick. According to this ruling, British Airways and CityFlyer could control a combined maximum of 41% of all Gatwick slots on an annual basis as well as no more than 70% of the airport's slots on an hourly basis and up to 65% of these slots within a two-hour time span. These limits were designed to enable other airlines to offer competitive schedules on short haul routes where British Airways or CityFlyer was the sole or dominant carrier, without resorting to compulsory slot transfers that would have impeded British Airways' ability to run an effective hub-and-spoke operation at Gatwick. Background to British Airways' acquisition of CityFlyer Express The main reason for British Airways' acquisition of CityFlyer Express was the fact that CityFlyer held about 13% of Gatwick slots at the time. BA did not want these to fall into any competitor's hands. BA also needed CityFlyer's slots to expand its Gatwick operation so that it could offer enough feeder services that would help it turn around its loss-making operation at the airport by improving long haul load factors. It was hoped that this would shore up the profitability of the UK flag carrier's long haul routes from Gatwick, thereby enabling it to return the entire Gatwick operation to profitability in the long term. CityFlyer and its predecessor Connectair had a proven track record of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was in stark contrast to BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick as a result of the British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA's mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low- cost, short haul unit within BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul loads and profits at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly overheads of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the revenue environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA's long haul services at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the direct operating costs of BA's mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick's revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick. =BA's inability to operate profitably at Gatwick following the acquisition of British Caledonian and Dan-Air= The prime causes for BA's inability to operate profitably at Gatwick are: * The unwieldy route structure it inherited from British Caledonian. * The Monopolies and Mergers Commission's decision to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to its competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian's short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to award these routes to rival airlines. * Its failure to transform the short haul operation inherited from Dan-Air into a low-cost unit within the Gatwick mainline short haul operation. * The fact that on identical routes with the same fare structure its costs at Gatwick are only marginally lower than at Heathrow, whereas load factors, revenues and yields ‚Äî the profit per passenger ‚Äî are significantly lower at Gatwick than at Heathrow. * Gatwick's location and its smaller catchment area compared with Heathrow. The route structure with which BA was left following its takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987 was notable for the unplanned and unsystematic manner in which it had grown since the early 1960s. At the time Sir Freddie Laker had begun building up British United Airways' scheduled route network in his capacity as that airline's managing director. In those days only very limited opportunities existed for wholly privately owned, independent airlines to provide fully fledged scheduled air services on major domestic and international trunk routes. This resulted in a poor fit of many routes in British United's network of scheduled services, thereby making it difficult to offer sensible connections that could be marketed to the travelling public. It also represented the best network structure the late Sir Freddie was able to put in place under the then prevailing regulatory regime.No Frills - The Truth behind the Low-cost Revolution in the Skies, Calder, S., Virgin Books, London, 2002, p. 132 British Caledonian, which BA acquired at the end of 1987 in what was widely acknowledged to be a rescue deal to prevent that airline from going under and its assets to pass into the hands of foreign-owned or -controlled competitors, had inherited British United's scheduled route structure at the time of its creation in late November 1970 when that carrier was taken over by Caledonian Airways. The most fitting description for the resulting network of domestic, European and intercontinental long haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes resembling a rag bag. This made it difficult to develop profitable streams of transfer traffic using Gatwick as a hub. For this reason it was always going to be a challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like Genoa or Jersey in order to make an onward connection at the airport to what many people would consider secondary places in Africa or South America, and an even greater challenge to do this profitably. At the height of its commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, British Caledonian managed to turn the dilemma the structure of its route network presented to its advantage by focusing on those routes that carried a very high proportion of potentially very profitable, oil-related, premium business traffic. It even managed to become the preferred carrier of many high-ranking oil industry executives based in Texas, the centre of the global oil industry, by providing convenient, hassle-free connections between Houston/Dallas, Lagos and Tripoli via the airline's Gatwick base. However, the downside of this initially successful strategy was that it made the company dependent on a small number of markets whose fortunes were tied to the commodity price cycle, in often unstable parts of the world, for most of its profits. Although this worked in British Caledonian's favour when the price of a barrel of crude oil was sky-high during the late '70s/early '80s, it started working against it when the oil price collapsed in the mid-'80s. It also further compounded the firm's growing financial problems at the time, culminating in the financial crisis that led to its takeover by archrival BA. In July 1987 BA publicly announced its intention to take over its ailing, home-grown rival British Caledonian. This led to a counter bid from ILG who sought to take over British Caledonian themselves and merge it with Air Europe. Although Air Europe eventually failed to merge with British Caledonian, its management succeeded in having the rival BA bid referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), a forerunner of today's Competition Commission, by claiming that this deal would destroy the UK's entire independent airline sector if approved without requiring BA to make any concessions to redress the resulting competitive imbalance. The decision by the MMC to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian's most important short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision by the CAA to award all of these routes to rival, independent airlines left BA's Gatwick operation with only ten short haul routes. This reduction in the number of short haul routes the airline continued to serve from Gatwick was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the company's Gatwick-based short haul fleet from 14 to ten Boeing 737-200 Advanced aircraft. The routes the CAA had awarded BA's independent rivals included the most profitable former British Caledonian short haul routes that had generated a substantial amount of transfer traffic for that airline's Gatwick-based scheduled operation, such as London Gatwick ‚Äî Paris Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick‚ÄîBrussels. It also included a number of British Caledonian's loss-making domestic routes, such as Gatwick‚ÄîGlasgow, Gatwick‚ÄîEdinburgh and Gatwick‚ÄîManchester, which were important feeder services for that airline's profitable long haul routes. The loss of these vital routes to rival airlines and the consequent reduction in the number of passengers making connections between BA's short and long haul flights at Gatwick threatened the company's ability to continue operating profitably on the long haul routes it had inherited at Gatwick from British Caledonian. BA's acquisition of the bulk of Dan-Air's scheduled activities at the end of October 1992 was intended to create the basis for a new in-house, low-cost unit that would enable the airline to reverse the heavy losses its own mainline operation's Gatwick-based short haul services incurred by transferring its entire short haul operation at the airport to the new unit. To attain this goal, BA's management unilaterally imposed the pay scales and terms of the old Dan-Air employment contracts on the entire workforce of its Gatwick-based short haul operation at the beginning of 1993. This effectively cut average pay for everyone by 20%. Management hoped this decision would help bring its short haul operation's costs in line with what Gatwick's revenue environment could sustain to enable it to return to profitability. However, BA's unilateral decision to force everyone working for its short haul operation at Gatwick to take a pay cut caused bitter feelings towards the company, among both former Dan-Air staff as well as BA's existing employees at Gatwick who were already working for its short haul operation there prior to Dan-Air's acquisition. The former, who were now officially members of the BA family, were upset that they did not enjoy the same pay and terms of employment as the other family members who were working for its long haul operation at the same airport as well as those who were based at Heathrow. The latter were equally upset at having their pay and terms of employment downgraded to what they considered the inferior standards of a charter airline, which their employer had saved from bankruptcy at the eleventh hour. The resulting unrest among BA's Gatwick-based short haul staff culminated in an unofficial, one-day strike during the first quarter of 1993. As a result of this unofficial industrial action, BA was forced to reverse its earlier decision to cut its Gatwick-based short haul workers' pay unilaterally. These events had clearly demonstrated the power of BA's unionised workforce. The power of the unions representing the affected workers as well as the entrenched attitudes of the middle management within BA's complex, hierarchical organisation also meant that the airline was unable to win any concessions that would have helped it offset the additional costs it was going to face in its short haul operation at Gatwick against increased labour productivity, in return for not cutting those workers' pay. Therefore, BA's attempt to extend the lower pay scales and less generous terms of employment that prevailed at Dan-Air to align the costs of its short haul operation at Gatwick with the airport's revenue environment eventually turned out to be a costly failure. BA's failure to simplify its complex, hierarchical organisation to enable it to reduce its overheads has been the main reason that has until now prevented the airline from achieving a cost structure that would make its Gatwick operation profitable. This situation has been further compounded by the fact that the company enjoys fewer economies of scale at Gatwick compared with Heathrow because the firm's operation at the former airport is smaller than the one at the latter. As a general rule, on average, a full-service scheduled operation at Gatwick with a fare structure that is identical to a similar operation at Heathrow produces a 10% lower load factor. It also generates a 20% lower revenue and results in an up to 25% lower yield. Although the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, \\"no frills\\" airlines on an ever-increasing number of UK domestic and European routes since the late 1990s has rendered this rule largely invalid for short to medium haul operations, it is still valid for most long haul operations where the competition from low-cost airlines is still in its infancy. Heathrow's and Gatwick's respective geographic location as well as the number of people living within each airport's catchment area accounts for this difference in load factors, revenues and yields. The former has a bigger catchment area than the latter because more people live north of the Thames than south of it. Heathrow's catchment area includes about three-quarters of London's population and roughly two-thirds of the population in the whole of Southeast England. London is where most of the demand for air travel in the Southeast originates. This means that 5.6mn people in London live in Heathrow's catchment area as opposed to 1.9mn in Gatwick's catchment area (out of an estimated total Greater London population of 7.5mn). The comparable figures for the Southeast are: 6.7mn people in Heathrow's catchment area as opposed to 3.3mn in Gatwick's catchment area (out of an estimated total population of 10mn). This is of particular significance for the premium travel market as Heathrow's larger catchment area means that it is able to offer more frequent flights to a greater number of destinations with more conveniently timed connections. This, in turn, helps attract a greater number of business travellers who generally tend to be the airlines' most profitable customers. It also means that there are four to five business travellers in Heathrow's catchment area for every business traveller in Gatwick's catchment area. On the other hand, the differing sizes of Heathrow's and Gatwick's catchment areas are far less significant for non-premium travel as many people are prepared to travel to an airport outside their catchment area to take advantage of a cheaper flight. However, the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, \\"no frills\\" airlines at Luton and Stansted respectively in recent years has somewhat diminished Heathrow's advantage in terms of its catchment area, as far as short to medium haul flights are concerned. Like Heathrow, these airports are located north of the Thames where most of the people in London and the Southeast live and their catchment areas, particularly Luton's, overlap with it. =BA's failed attempt at a \\"virtual\\" merger with American Airlines= During the summer of 1996 BA announced that it was planning to enter into a new code- and revenue- as well as profit-sharing alliance with American Airlines. The planned alliance was the most ambitious and far-reaching commercial airline alliance attempted at the time. It was also dependent on being granted anti-trust immunity by the British Government and the United States Department of Justice as well as the European Commission's Competition Directorate. This mega alliance was meant to replace the much more limited code-share agreement BA had with US Airways since the beginning of 1993, which was not dependent on anti-trust immunity. The new alliance envisaged merging the transatlantic operations of both airlines by combining all their commercial activities into a joint company, thus making it a \\"virtual\\" merger. One of the new alliance's most outstanding features was a plan for an hourly shuttle service between London Heathrow and New York John F Kennedy, the world's busiest and most profitable intercontinental air route. This meant that BA, which at the time only controlled about 38% of all take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, needed to secure additional prime time slots at Heathrow in order to be able to launch the hourly JFK shuttle. In those days secondary slot trading, where airlines buy and sell take-off and landing slots at congested airports, was still in its infancy and there was uncertainty concerning the legality of this activity.EU clears way for secondary slot trading , Flightglobal, 17 June 2008 In anticipation of gaining all necessary approvals for the proposed alliance ‚Äî including anti-trust immunity, BA decided to reserve the required slots at Heathrow by moving all long-haul services to East, Central and Southern Africa (other than those to South Africa itself) as well as to Latin America to Gatwick over the 1996 summer timetable period as well as the 1996/7 winter timetable period. BA chose to transfer these routes to Gatwick because they generated lower traffic volumes and were therefore less profitable than its routes to North America, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent as well as the Far East. They also carried relatively few transfer passengers. This meant that the risk of losing these passengers to a competitor because of Gatwick's smaller number of connections compared with Heathrow was fairly low. BA furthermore decided to transfer a number of barely profitable or wholly loss- making, short haul routes to secondary destinations in the UK and Eastern Europe to Gatwick because BA could use these slots far more profitably to operate additional transatlantic services from Heathrow under this alliance. With the benefit of hindsight, BA had underestimated the strength of the gathering opposition to its planned \\"virtual\\" merger with American Airlines. It had also underestimated its opponents' political clout with the regulatory authorities in the UK and the US as well as the European Union. At the time Sir Richard Branson publicly referred to this mega alliance as the \\"alliance from hell\\". He feared that it was part of a new BA strategy to drive Virgin Atlantic, BA's main UK-based transatlantic competitor, out of business. He therefore wanted to have it stopped at any cost. BA's US-based transatlantic rivals, especially those that were denied access to Heathrow under the stringent Bermuda II regulatory regime, wanted approval of this alliance to be made dependent upon the successful negotiation of a new UK-US \\"Open Skies\\" air services agreement that would supersede Bermuda II and remove all access restrictions to Heathrow. Eventually, the alliance was effectively killed off when regulators on both sides of the Atlantic demanded that BA should hand over hundreds of slots at Heathrow and that anti-trust immunity should be withheld for the Heathrow‚ÄîJFK \\"flagship\\" route. At the same time, BA's senior management had become so preoccupied with this alliance that it did not pay any attention to the fundamental changes that were beginning to re-shape the airline industry at the time. These changes were going to have a profound effect on the commercial environment in which BA was operating. They included the inexorable rise of the low-cost, \\"no frills\\" airlines, first and foremost EasyJet and Ryanair, in BA's own backyard as well as the growing competitive threat posed by the government-assisted recovery of Lufthansa and Air France, BA's main European full-service, network airline rivals, both of which had been in no position to challenge BA commercially in the early to mid-1990s as they were effectively bankrupt at that time. For all these reasons the grandiose BA-AA alliance ultimately turned out to be a very costly distraction for BA's management and was the main contributing factor that led to Robert Ayling's downfall who happened to be the BA chief executive during that period. =Project Jupiter= Project \\"Jupiter\\" was BA's internal working title for the strategy it had devised to turn the struggling Gatwick operation into a fully fledged hub. The airline reckoned that this would enable it to turn around the poor overall financial performance of its operation at the airport after years of heavy losses. BA decided to give its operation there the economies of scale as well as the scope, in terms of flight connections, it considered necessary to attract enough travellers who were prepared to pay fares that were sufficiently high-yield to achieve sustained profitability. The aim was to make Gatwick the second biggest hub-and-spoke operation on BA's network as well as one of the biggest outside the US. Within three years from the launch of Project \\"Jupiter\\", the BA mainline operation more than doubled the number of long haul aircraft at Gatwick and increased the number of short haul aircraft at the airport by more than half. In addition, the airline's franchisees, notably CityFlyer Express and GB Airways, increased their Gatwick-based fleets as well. During that period the number of BA passengers passing through Gatwick also doubled. The role BA had assigned its franchisees generally and CityFlyer in particular to make Project \\"Jupiter\\" work was to provide feeder services that were expected to be profitable in their own right and enable transfer passengers to connect at ease with BA's long haul services at Gatwick, thereby improving those services' load factors and increasing their profitability. Unlike some of the North American commuter carriers that operate under franchise agreements on the same routes as their mainline partners using smaller aircraft at less busy times, BA's franchisees only operated on routes the company's mainline short haul operation could not serve profitably from Gatwick itself due to its higher cost base. By the turn of the millennium, BA, the firm's franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partners in the Oneworld global airline alliance together controlled about 40% of all take-off and landing slots at Gatwick and used a fleet of more than 100 aircraft to serve around 120 destinations worldwide from the airport, more than any other airline from any airport in the UK. Together they carried 8m passengers through Gatwick annually. This accounted for almost 30% of the total number of passengers passing through the airport each year during that period. 45% of the passengers travelling with BA and its affiliated carriers through Gatwick were changing flights there. At the time, CityFlyer Express and the other BA franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partner airlines at Gatwick accounted for 1,000 of these passengers each day.Flight Home: Widening the franchise, Flight International, 25 March 1998 (Flightglobal: Home > News Article) Ultimately, BA's attempt to make its Gatwick operation profitable by building it up into a full-scale hub-and-spoke operation failed. When Rod Eddington took over as BA's chief executive in 2000, he initiated a root-and-branch review of the airline's worldwide operation with the aim of improving profitability after it had incurred its first net loss since privatisation during the 1999/2000 financial year. This included a review of the loss-making Gatwick operation. At the time Eddington stated that BA's Gatwick operation alone had incurred a loss of ¬£40mn before allocating overheads, in spite of having ¬£4.5bn of assets at the airport, and that it was destroying shareholder value. (Industry sources estimated that during the aforesaid period the total loss for the airline's entire Gatwick operation was ¬£200mn after allocating all overheads.)BA News, British Airways plc, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 20 October 2000Gatwick Life, (BA axes ten planes), Life Newspapers, Horley, Surrey, 9 October 2003 Eddington attributed this loss to Gatwick's failure to attract sufficient high-yield traffic. He furthermore stated that Gatwick's loss was entirely accounted for by its mainline short haul operation whose schedules were primarily designed to feed BA's long haul services at the airport. Eddington was of the opinion that this was the wrong way around because there were not enough early morning departures and late- evening arrivals that could have attracted a greater number of locally based business and leisure passengers requiring same-day-return facilities. Also, the long haul route network BA operated from Gatwick at the time strangely resembled the long haul route structure British Caledonian had inherited from British United at the time of its inception three decades earlier. Moreover, in his opinion, the physical constraints imposed on BA's Gatwick operation by the airport's single runway and two terminals meant that the airline could not offer truly competitive schedules, in terms of frequencies and conveniently timed connections. In addition, Eddington also felt that Gatwick's operation was far too fragmented, in terms of what he called the airport's \\"bewildering array\\" of operators and their equipment, which substantially increased costs. At the time, in addition to BA's mainline operation, which accounted for the bulk of the airline's scheduled services at Gatwick, all of its UK-based franchisees (with the exception of British Mediterranean and Loganair) as well as the company's subsidiaries and partners provided scheduled services at the airport as well, in some cases with a single aircraft on one route only, operating all aircraft types in their combined inventory except Concorde and some of the smaller commuter planes. Independent analysts were also of the opinion that the long haul routes BA chose to transfer from Heathrow to Gatwick mainly served what many people considered secondary destinations in Africa and Latin America. These were generally not the type of destinations to which business people, including those living in Gatwick's catchment area, were travelling. On the other hand, popular destinations for business and leisure travel, such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Hong Kong or Singapore were either under-served or not served at all. For instance, at the time BA operated Gatwick's only daily service to New York JFK and there were no direct services from the airport to any of the other aforementioned destinations.The Sunday Business (Go must go), The Business Publishing Ltd., London, 15/16 October 2000 These analysts furthermore pointed to the extent and speed of BA's growth in employment at the airport during that time as a major cause of the huge loss incurred by that operation. Within a relatively short time span of only three years, the airline had increased its headcount at Gatwick alone to 8,500. This was more than the entire 7,700-strong worldwide workforce of British Caledonian at its peak during the early part of the summer in 1986. BA had effectively created a miniature version of its Heathrow-based organisational hierarchy at Gatwick, thereby multiplying its overheads and increasing its cost base at the latter airport. In October 2000 BA publicly announced its decision to de-hub Gatwick and to turn it into a regional Southeast airport primarily serving leisure-orientated point-to-point routes where most of the demand originated in the Gatwick catchment area.No Frills - The Truth behind the Low-cost Revolution in the Skies, Calder, S., Virgin Books, London, 2002, p. 139 This was part of a new strategy designed to provide services from Gatwick only if there was sufficient demand in the local catchment area and to do it at a cost the local revenue environment could support. It was also part of a strategy to deny the low-cost airlines generally and EasyJet in particular the physical space, in terms of airport slots, to continue expanding unabated in the Southeast. The aim of this secondary strategy was to prevent these carriers from posing an ever-greater threat to BA's high-cost, mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which suffered annual losses to the tune of several hundred million pounds during that period.Gatwick Life, (BA starts new war on fares), Life Newspapers, Horley, Surrey, 20 May 2004 BA therefore decided to move all predominantly business-orientated long haul routes (other than those that had to stay at Gatwick due to bilateral constraints, such as its non-stop services to Atlanta, Dallas and Houston) back to Heathrow. The airline also decided to withdraw all loss-making services from the airport and to simplify its Gatwick-based fleet by reducing the number of aircraft stationed there and operating only two different aircraft types from the airport. Henceforth, all short to medium haul services from Gatwick were to be exclusively operated with Boeing 737s, while Boeing 777s were to be the only aircraft to ply the long haul routes from the airport. This was accompanied by a reduction in BA's headcount at Gatwick to 3,000 as well as the introduction of a common cabin crew pool for both its short and long haul operations at the airport and a number of other cost-cutting measures.Skyport, ('Gatwick op must make a profit', says BA), Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 16 September 2005  British Airways' short haul reorganisation  Under the franchise agreement it had concluded with BA before being taken over in 1999, CityFlyer Express initially operated as an independent business unit within British Airways serving a number of short haul European and UK regional routes from Gatwick that were completely separate from the services BA's mainline operation provided from the airport. However, following BA's decision to abandon its hub-and-spoke strategy at Gatwick in October 2000, CityFlyer was subsumed into British Airways' mainline operation at Gatwick in 2001, thereby ceasing to exist as a separate entity. There were two reasons for fully integrating CityFlyer into BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick. The first of these was operational. Although CityFlyer remained a profitable business in its own right following its acquisition by BA and industry analysts familiar with the company expected it to generate a profit of at least ¬£7mn during BA's 2000/1 financial year, BA found that franchising overall had not been the financial success it had hoped. There were too many franchisees whose administrative and sales support actually cost the airline more than the additional revenue resulting from franchise fees and the connecting traffic its franchise partners generated. Therefore, as far as the bigger picture was concerned, BA's senior management felt that the franchise agreements with its various franchisees, all of which were profitable in their own right, had benefited the franchisees more than itself.The Sunday Business (BA closes a profitmaker), The Business Publishing Ltd., London, 22/23 October 2000 The second reason was related to maintaining good industrial relations between management and the workforce, especially those working for the mainline short haul operation at Gatwick. These workers had always regarded the concept of franchising generally and CityFlyer Express in particular as a Trojan horse. They feared that BA's long-term strategy was to hand over its entire, heavily loss-making, mainline short haul operation to profitable franchisees such as CityFlyer, thereby threatening many jobs and the terms of employment of the remaining mainline employees. They also feared that BA would eventually resemble a \\"virtual\\" airline. Therefore, BA's senior management decided that it was prudent to reduce the number of franchise agreements and to make use of franchisees only if it gave BA a presence in markets it did not already serve itself and where there was no prospect of providing such a service profitably through its mainline operation. Following the integration of CityFlyer Express into BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, all former CityFlyer employees other than flight crew and engineers working on the jet fleet were made redundant. The ex-CityFlyer flight crew and engineers whom BA continued to employ were transferred along with their equipment to BA's regional bases in Birmingham and Manchester. BA's subsequent decision to retire the former CityFlyer turboprop fleet, resulted in the withdrawal of the airline's services from Gatwick to Antwerp, Guernsey and Rotterdam. In addition, the fact that the integration of low-cost CityFlyer Express into the high-cost BA mainline short haul operation at Gatwick inevitably meant that formerly profitable CityFlyer routes were now burdened with the expensive BA mainline overheads, necessitated the withdrawal of additional BA short haul services from Gatwick over the course of a few years, including CityFlyer's routes to Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. At the same time, British Regional Airlines, another British Airways franchise operator based on the Isle of Man, was acquired by British Airways as well and in 2002 was merged with British Airways' wholly owned regional subsidiary Brymon Airways to form British Airways Citiexpress, which would assume the operation of domestic and European services from UK regional airports. On 1 February 2006, British Airways Citiexpress was renamed BA Connect. Facts of interest * Brad Burgess was instrumental in setting up Connectair. He had been managing director of Air Europe Express and CityFlyer Express, and subsequently he was chairman of Astraeus. * Flight numbers in the 7000 and 8000 range used to be allocated to CityFlyer Express- operated British Airways franchise flights. Following CityFlyer's integration into the British Airways mainline operation at Gatwick, the latter's scheduled services from the airport to Amsterdam Schiphol, Bordeaux, Dublin, Jersey, Luxembourg, Nice and Toulouse still used flight numbers in these ranges, thus identifying them as former CityFlyer Express routes.

Because the accretor is a compact object, an accretion disc forms, which is the source of the X-rays. Source. An Interacting binary star is a type of binary star in which one or both of the component stars has filled or exceeded its Roche lobe. When this happens, material from one star (the donor star) will flow towards the other star (the accretor). If the accretor is a compact star, an accretion disk may form. The physical conditions in such a system can be complex and highly variable, and they are common sources of cataclysmic outbursts. A common type of interacting binary star is one in which one of the components is a compact object which is well within its Roche lobe, while the other is an evolved giant star. If the compact object is a white dwarf, then accretion of material from the evolved star onto the white dwarf's surface may result in its mass increasing to beyond the Chandrasekhar limit. This can lead to runaway thermonuclear reactions and the massive explosion of the star in a Type I supernova. An example of such a binary star is R Canis Majoris, in which it is thought that the secondary star has exceeded its Roche lobe and transferred mass to the primary star. This has resulted in the early evolution of the secondary star onto the subgiant star branch, and in exposure of helium-rich material on the surface of the primary, causing it to burn brighter and have a higher effective temperature than would usually be expected for a star of its mass.

There are two main sub-types of irregular variable: eruptive and pulsating. Eruptive irregular variables are divided into three categories: * Group I variables are split into subgroups IA (spectral types O to A) and IB (spectral types F through M). * Orion variables, GCVS type IN (irregular and nebulous), indigenous to star-forming regions, may vary by several magnitudes with rapid changes of up to 1 magnitude in 1 to 10 days, are similarly divided by spectral type into subgroups INA and INB, but with the addition of another subgroup, INT, for T Tauri stars, or INT(YY) for YY Orionis stars. * The third category of eruptive irregulars are the IS stars, which show rapid variations of 0.5 to 1 magnitude in a few hours or days; again, these come in subgroups ISA and ISB. Pulsating irregular giants or supergiants, called slow irregular variables, are all of late spectral types (K, M, C, or S), and classed as type L-LB for giants and LC for supergiants. How many of these are actually semi-regular variables that simply need more study, remains unclear.

Until this area joined the city in 1886 it was known as the village of Geddes. History West Fayette Street c.1900 The Syracuse Far Westside is bounded by Erie Blvd West on the northeast, South Geddes Street on the lower east and Rowland Street on the south. The western border runs from Velasko Road in the south, to South Avery Avenue, Salisbury Road, Myrtle Street and parallel to Charles Avenue in Westvale, a section of Geddes ending at Willis Avenue just south of Onondaga Lake at the railroad tracks. Annexation In 1886 the village of Geddes was the largest community in the town of Geddes with many homes and businesses. Geddes officially became a town in 1848. \\"It then included the west side of Syracuse to Geddes Street, which was the eastern boundary of the town.\\" The old town square, 1624 West Genesee Street, Village of Geddes, circa 1875. By Robert N. Dennis Local residents voted to join the city because Syracuse had a paid professional police department, a paid professional fire department and the city was about to obtain an excellent water supply from Skaneateles Lake. The village of Geddes was annexed by Syracuse on May 20, 1886. \\"In one day, Geddes lost its town hall, town supervisor, town clerk, town justice, most town board members and three-quarters of its population.\\" The residents in the area encouraged the annexation. Twice, entire commercial blocks along Furnace Street (now West Fayette Street) burned to the ground for lack of water and fire protection. Landmarks When the village of Geddes joined the city in 1886, Major John P. Burnet, who owned a large farm on Tipperary Hill, gave a large hill top plot of land to Syracuse now known as Burnet Park with the condition that the city spend $6,000 to build roads and plant trees in this new city park. Burnet was satisfied with the city's efforts, and thus, in 1887, gave the city an additional plot of land, known as the Oak Grove, which is still full of oak trees, on the corner of South Avery Avenue and Whittier Avenue. The Far Westside includes Tipperary Hill, an Irish neighborhood that is known for its upside-down traffic signal. Additionally, Burnet Park and the Rosamond Gifford Zoo are within its limits. The Westcott Reservoir, an excellent sledding location, is also within its limits. The St. Patrick's Church Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Demographics 44 percent of housing in the neighborhood is owner-occupied, close to the citywide average. As of the 2000 census, 6,916 people lived in the Far Westside. 91.3% were White, 8.7% other. 51.9% were female, 48.1% male. The median age was 34.2, and the median household income was $28,006. Registered voters are 38% Democrat, 28% Republican, 26% non-enrolled, and 8% percent other. References External links *Far Westside neighborhood in Syracuse, New York. City-Data.com.

The first series, produced and directed by Quentin Lawrence, was screened in the UK on ITV in 1970. The second series, directed by David Reid and David Lane, was shown in 1971. Each series had thirteen episodes, most but not all written by Carpenter, who also published two books based on the scripts. Summary Catweazle (Geoffrey Bayldon) is an eccentric 11th-century wizard who accidentally (by total immersion in water) travels through time. In the first series he arrives in the year 1969 and befriends a red-headed teenager, Edward Bennet, nicknamed Carrot (Robin Davies), who spends most of the rest of the series attempting to hide Catweazle from his father (Bud Tingwell) and the farmhand Sam (Neil McCarthy). Catweazle searches for a way to return to his own time while hiding out in a disused water tower, which he calls Castle Saburac, with his familiar, a toad called Touchwood. The second series featured a 12-part riddle that Catweazle, transported to the 1970s, attempts to solve at the rate of one clue an episode, the solution (as he thinks) being revealed in the 13th. A third series, which was apparently to be set on the Bennets' farm from the first series rather than the stately home of the second series, never got past the drafting stage. Catweazle mistakes all modern technology for powerful magic (an example of Clarke's third law), particularly \\"elec-trickery\\" (electricity) and the \\"telling bone\\" (telephone). Often he tried spells that failed and he would sigh \\"Nothing works\\". Feeling flushed with success in the final episode, his last words were \\"Everything works Touchwood, everything works!\\". Both series were shot on 16mm film. The first series was mostly shot on location at Home Farm, East Clandon, near Guildford in Surrey, England in 1969. The second was mostly filmed around the Bayford/Brickendon area of Hertfordshire in 1970 (S02E12 shows scenes of Brickendon and near Bayford station). Interior scenes were filmed at Halliford Studios in Shepperton. Both series centred on the relationship between Catweazle and the young lad from the present day who quickly accepts Catweazle as a friend. The second series had a more farcical character than the first. In the plaster fight scene in the episode 'The Enchanted King'. Cedric's parents were slightly unhinged gentry living in their family stately home. Almost all characters seemed out of touch with reality except Cedric. In the second series Catweazle sings/speaks to himself using the series theme tune. Although Bayldon thought the story had run its course after two series, he still praised the second, commenting that two episodes were, in his view, below standard, but not written by Carpenter: \\"There are two episodes I felt that with; the rest I think are lovely. I thought they were dreadful, but they were not written by Richard.

Personal life Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born near Concordia, Missouri, to German-American parents, Joseph Adolph Kuhlman and Emma Walkenhorst. After a spiritual experience at age 14, several years later, she began itinerant preaching, with her elder sister and brother- in law, in Idaho. Later, she was ordained by the Evangelical Church Alliance. Kuhlman met Burroughs Waltrip, a Texas evangelist who was eight years her senior. Shortly after his visit to Denver, Waltrip divorced his wife, left his family and moved to Mason City, Iowa, where he began a revival center called Radio Chapel. Kuhlman and her friend and pianist Helen Gulliford came into town to help him raise funds for his ministry. It was shortly after their arrival that the romance between Burroughs and Kuhlman became publicly known. Burroughs and Kuhlman decided to wed. While discussing the matter with some friends, Kuhlman had said that she could not \\"find the will of God in the matter.\\" These and other friends encouraged her not to go through with the marriage, but Kuhlman justified it to herself and others by believing that Waltrip's wife had left him, not the other way around. On October 18, 1938, she secretly married \\"Mister,\\" as she liked to call Waltrip, in Mason City. The wedding did not give her new peace about their union, however. The couple had no children. Regarding her marriage, in a 1952 interview with the Denver Post, Kuhlman said, \\"He charged‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîthat I refused to live with him. And I haven't seen him in eight years.\\"Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p. 82 She was divorced by Burroughs Waltrip in 1948. Ministry Kuhlman traveled extensively around the United States and in many other countries holding \\"healing crusades\\" between the 1940s and 1970s. She was one of the most well-known healing ministers in the world. Kuhlman had a weekly TV program in the 1960s and 1970s called I Believe In Miracles that was aired nationally. She also had a 30-minute nationwide radio ministry of teaching from the Bible and frequently would feature excerpts from her healing services (both music and message). Her foundation was established in 1954, and its Canadian branch in 1970. Late in her life she was supportive of the nascent Jesus movement, and received endorsements by its key leaders, including David Wilkerson and Chuck Smith. By 1970 she moved to Los Angeles, conducting healing services for thousands of people, and despite a huge difference, was often compared to Aimee Semple MacPherson. She became well known for her \\"gift of healing\\" despite, as she often noted, having no theological training. She was friendly with Christian television pioneer Pat Robertson and made guest appearances at his Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) and on the network's flagship program \\"The 700 Club.\\" In 1975, Kuhlman was sued by Paul Bartholomew, her personal administrator, who claimed that she kept $1 million in jewelry and $1 million in fine art hidden away and sued her for $430,500 for breach of contract. Two former associates accused her in the lawsuit of diverting funds and of illegally removing records, which she denied and said the records were not private. According to Kuhlman, the lawsuit was settled prior to trial. Healing Many accounts of medically documented healings were published in her books, which were written by author Jamie Buckingham of Florida, including her autobiography, which was dictated at a hotel in Las Vegas.Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p 167 Buckingham also wrote his own Kuhlman biography that presented an unvarnished account of her life.Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International An estimated two million people reported they were healed in her meetings over the years. Following a 1967 fellowship in Philadelphia, Dr. William A. Nolen conducted a case study of 23 people who said they had been cured during one of her services. Also see: William Nolen, Healing: a doctor in search of a miracle. New York: Random House Nolen's long term follow-ups concluded that there were no cures in those cases. One woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman's command; her spine collapsed the next day and she died four months later. Nolen's analysis of Kulhman came in for criticism from believers. Lawrence Althouse, a physician, said that Nolen had attended only one of Kuhlman's services and did not follow up with all of those who said they had been healed there. Dr. Richard Casdorph produced a book of evidence in support of miraculous healings by Kuhlman. Hendrik van der Breggen, a Christian philosophy professor, argued in favor of the claims. Author Craig Keener concluded, \\"No one claims that everyone was healed, but it is also difficult to dispute that significant recoveries occurred, apparently in conjunction with prayer. One may associate these with Kathryn Kuhlman's faith or that of the supplicants, or, as in some of Kuhlman's teaching, to no one's faith at all; but the evidence suggests that some people were healed, even in extraordinary ways.\\" Dr. Richard Owellen, a member of the cancer‚Äêresearch department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who appeared frequently at Miss Kuhlman's services, testified to various healings that he said he had investigated.Kathryn Kuhlman, Evangelist And Faith Healer, Dies in Tulsa, New York Times, Feb. 22, 1976. Death In 1955, in her late 40s, Kuhlman was diagnosed with a heart problem. She kept a very busy schedule, often traveling across the United States and around the world, holding two- to six-hour long meetings which ended late. \\"The television ministry itself required more than $30,000 a week... To stop, to even cut back, would mean she was beginning to fail. The same was true with the miracle services. As the pain in her chest grew almost unbearable, instead of holding fewer services, she increased the number.\\"Jamie Buckingham, Daughter of Destiny, 1999, p. 295. In July 1975 her doctor diagnosed her with a minor heart flare-up; in November she had a relapse. As a result, Kuhlman had open- heart surgery in Tulsa, Oklahoma from which she died on February 20, 1976. Kathryn Kuhlman was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. A plaque in her honor is in the main city park in Concordia, Missouri, a town in central Missouri on Interstate Highway 70. After she died, her will led to controversy. She left $267,500, the bulk of her estate, to three family members and twenty employees. Smaller bequests were given to 19 other employees. According to the Independent Press-Telegram, her employees were disappointed that \\"she did not leave most of her estate to the foundation as she had done under a previous 1974 will.\\" The Kathryn Kuhlman Foundation had continued, but due to lack of funding, in 1982 terminated its nationwide radio broadcasting. Ultimately, the Foundation shut its doors in April 2016.https://www.charismanews.com/us/55287-kathryn-kuhlman- s-foundation-shutters-doors-40-years-after-her-death Legacy For several decades there has been serious debate regarding the authenticity of Kuhlman's ministry. Some would suggest that she was a modern-day prophet exercising the power of God. The debate continues today with many believers upholding Kuhlman as an important forerunner to the present-day charismatic movement. Still, she influenced faith healers Benny Hinn and Billy Burke. Hinn has adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about Kuhlman, though it is a fact that at no point did he meet her personally, nor speak to her. However, Billy Burke did meet her and was counseled by her, having claimed a miracle healing in her service as a young boy. In 1981 David Byrne and Brian Eno sampled one of Kuhlman's sermons. Questions about her were raised in dealing with True Doctrine in the Church, which are published by Jack Chick. She appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1974. Also, she was mentioned on more than one occasion on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, as well as The Carol Burnett Show. Ruth Buzzi did a character based on Kuhlman on Rowan and Martin's Laugh In.

Life  She was born in 1865 in Zalavas (now part of Vilnius County), at that time part of the Russian Empire, to Konstanty Koplewski, a prominent physician. After graduating from high school, she moved to St. Petersburg, Russia. There she studied in the Bestuzhev Courses, a university for women, while cultivating friendships within certain revolutionary circles. It was there she met Marian Juszkiewicz, a young railway engineer whom she married in 1883. Their marriage was not a happy one, however, and fell apart soon after the birth of their daughter, Wanda, in 1887. In 1892, the beautiful, intelligent and socially poised Maria met J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. After seven years, they married on 15 July 1899 at the village of Paproƒá Du≈ºa near ≈Åom≈ºa. Since Maria was a divorcee and the Catholic Church did not recognize divorce, she and Pi≈Çsudski had converted to Protestantism. Soon afterward they settled in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where J√≥zef continued his revolutionary activities. In February 1900, they were arrested when a clandestine printing press was discovered in their apartment. After eleven months Maria was released, while Pi≈Çsudski remained imprisoned in the infamous Tenth Pavilion at the Warsaw Citadel in the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Upon his subsequent escape from a mental hospital in St. Petersburg to which he had been transferred, the couple moved to Lw√≥w, in eastern Galicia in Austria- Hungary. In mid-November 1901, they relocated to London, the seat of the Polish Socialist Party's leadership. In April 1902, however, pursuant to the needs of the PPS, they returned to Lw√≥w, and in 1904 moved to Krak√≥w. In May 1906 Pi≈Çsudski met Aleksandra Szczerbi≈Ñska, who was working with the PPS paramilitary organization. After a time, Pi≈Çsudski and Aleksandra began an affair. In 1908 Maria Pi≈Çsudska's daughter by her first marriage, Wanda, died. By 1909, Maria was aware of J√≥zef's affair but refused to divorce him, and they continued to share a home until the outbreak of the First World War. Maria remained popular among the PPS and its paramilitary faction, and had helped J√≥zef gain adherents amongst them. Their marriage continued to deteriorate, however, and after his release from Magdeburg Prison in November 1918, Pi≈Çsudski abandoned her. Aleksandra Szczerbi≈Ñska became his de facto wife, although for propriety's sake they had to maintain separate homes. Maria Pi≈Çsudska withdrew from public life and continued to reside in Krak√≥w. Maria Pi≈Çsudska died in Krak√≥w on 17 August 1921. She was buried at the Rossa Cemetery in Vilnius.

The town serves as the seat of Walcha Shire. Walcha is located by road from Sydney at the intersection of the Oxley Highway and Thunderbolts Way. The Apsley River passes through the town to tumble over the Apsley Falls before joining the Macleay River further on. Originally the river caused flooding in the town prior to a levee bank being constructed and saving the town from more floods. At the , Walcha had a population of 1,451 people. The Main North railway line is located west at a separate village called Walcha Road which serves as the railhead. This is served by the daily NSW TrainLink Xplorer service between Sydney and Armidale. The railway line was built at Walcha Road, because it was the closest point they could get to the town, due to the steep climb over the Great Dividing Range. History The area is thought to have been occupied by the Danggadi (or Dunghutti) Aborigines for 6000 years prior to European settlement. The tablelands had places for ceremonies and trade of goods, and there are traces of bora grounds near Walcha. In the colder months, tribes retreated to the gorge country to the east, where fish and animals were plentiful. In 1818, John Oxley was the first European person to discover the area and the falls which were later to be named Apsley Falls. Hamilton Collins Sempill was the first settler in the New England area when he took up the 'Wolka' run in 1832, establishing slab huts where 'Langford' now stands. Other early runs around the district were Bergen-op-Zoom (1834), Ohio (1836), Europambela (c.1836), Surveyor‚Äôs Creek (1836), Emu Creek (c.1837), Ingalba (1837), Orandumbie (1837), Tiara (1837) and Winterbourne (1837). A severe depression from 1841 to 1843, and low demand for wool created hardship for many of these early settlers. In 1848 Walcha run is recorded as being and in the lease of David Lanarch. During 1854 Walcha was sold to Rundle and Dangar who held the mortgage for Jamison and Connal.Donald, J.Kay, Exploring the North Coast and New England, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1978, Later John Fletcher acquired Walcha and moved from Branga Plains to Oorundumby. After being sold in 1905, Oorundumby was resumed for soldier settlement in 1947 and subdivided into 22 holdings. Not long after Sempill's arrival, in 1834, John McLean took up a run he called Bergen op Zoom, reportedly named in tribute to relatives Allen and Francis McLean, who had assisted the Dutch in the defence of that town against the French in the War of the Sixth Coalition. When McLean died in 1851, his family sold Bergen Op Zoom to Shropshire-born artist Edward Baker-Boulton,Edwards, John H, Edward Baker Boulton: Australia's Forgotten Artist, Norrong Press, Sydney, 2004 who with his brothers already owned extensive runs in the Wellington district. Baker-Boulton was typical of the absentee owners of large stations, living for the most part in Sydney or 'back home' in the UK, the station being run as a partnership with David Bell, until 1874 when Bell left to take over management of his own holdings in the district. Baker-Boulton then returned from England to manage the station hands-on, and died there, aged 83, in 1895, where he is buried in the Walcha Cemetery. He was a noted artist of the early Colonial period whose works are largely forgotten now. Edith, the eldest daughter of his second wife, Rachel Gwyn, who visited Walcha in 1890, was the mother of renowned English children's author, Arthur Ransome, whose bucolic Swallows and Amazons series is still in print in the 21st Century. The sixth book in the series, Pigeon Post, was the inaugural winner of the Carnegie Medal in 1936. A \\"wool\\" road to Port Macquarie (the Oxley Highway) was under construction in 1842 for the transportation of wool from New England to the coast. Walcha Post Office opened on 1 July 1850. The mail arrived from Macdonald River (now Bendemeer). Walcha was gazetted as a village site in 1852, when town allotments were sold, with annual sales following. At that time there was a blacksmith's shop, a general store and a flour mill. A Roman Catholic chapel was erected in 1854, a police station and the first Presbyterian church was built in 1857 and the Walcha National School in 1859. In 1861 the population was recorded at 355 and the Anglican church was built in 1862 of stone taken from the demolished homestead, 'Villa Walcha', erected on the Wolka run in the 1840s. The old church has fine stained-glass windows which bear tribute to some of the town's pioneers. The population dropped in the 1860s but the town soon began to grow for two reasons: firstly, red cedar getters were active in the area's rainforests by about 1870. Gold was discovered near Walcha in the 1870s at Glen Morrison, Tia, The Cells River and Nowendoc. Antimony, copper, graphite, manganese, silver and high quality slate was also mined in the district. On 5 April 1878 Walcha was proclaimed a town, when it was gazetted, the boundaries defined and a courthouse was built. A rail link to Sydney and Uralla opened at Walcha Road in 1882. The town became a municipality in 1889. On 19 March 1890 the Walcha Pastoral & Agricultural Association was formed. This annual show has excellent exhibits of livestock, produce, vegetables, flowers, wool and handicrafts. Walcha Cottage Hospital founded in 1890 and was situated on the southern hill in South Street. The Shire of Apsley was constituted by proclamation on 7 March 1906. It is in the counties of Vernon, Hawes, and Inglis and comprises about 60 parishes. The area is . The Shire of Walcha was constituted by the Union of the Municipality and the Shire of Apsley as from on 1 June 1955. Other district villages are: Niangala, Nowendoc and part of Woolbrook with settlements at Brackendale, Glen Morrison, Ingalba, Tia and Yarrowitch. History was made at Walcha in 1950 when a Tiger Moth was the first aircraft used to spread superphosphate by air in Australia. The \\"super\\" was dropped on Mirani and other landholders soon followed suit to greatly increase the livestock carrying capacity of the district. In 1992 the Walcha Telecottage was established to become the first telecentre established in Australia. The Telecottage is a not for profit community with the latest information communication facilities, in order to activate interactions between the local communities and to create employment opportunities. This Telecottage carries out not only the fundamental types of work such as job training, remote education, secretarial service and data analysis, but also Internet access service for individuals and small companies. Walcha Telecottage produces a weekly community newsletter, the Apsley Advocate, which is free and delivered to over 1,600 commercial and private addresses.Andrew Hunter Retrieved on 23 January 2009 Heritage listings Walcha has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Ohio Homestead * South Street: St Andrew's Anglican Church * Thee Street: St Andrew's Rectory * Main Northern railway: Walcha Road railway station During 2008 Walcha recorded one of the state's highest rises in property values at 20 per cent over the last 5 years, according to a report from Australian Property Monitors.Walcha News, Walcha Property Amongst the Best in NSW, 15 May 2008 The Register of the National Estate listed, Langford, Thunderbolts Way, Walcha, NSW The Register of the National Estate listed, St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Walcha, NSW The local buildings and objects of natural, indigenous and historic significance listed on the Register of the National Estate includes the following:Australian Heritage Places Retrieved on 23 November 2008 * Apsley Gorge National Park (1977 boundary), Oxley Highway * Betts Farm, Irish Town, Thunderbolts Way * Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves, now known as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia (Hastings-Macleay Group) * Europambela Homestead including outbuildings, grounds and Cemetery, Moona Plains Road * Langford Homestead, Garden and Cemetery, Nowendoc Road * Ohio Homestead, Ohio Road * Rowleys Creek Gulf Nature Reserve * St Andrews Anglican Church (former), South Street * St Andrews Rectory (former) including garden and trees, Fitzroy Street * St Pauls Presbyterian Church and Fletcher Memorial Hall, Hill Street * The Hole Creek Nature Reserve (1977 boundary), Winterbourne Road * Walcha Courthouse, Apsley Street Climate Like most of the Northern Tablelands, Walcha's climate can be described as having a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfb), but with a relatively strong continental influence and characteristics; is cold in winter and mild to warm in summer, with a temperature range from -2.3 ¬∞C to 11.8 ¬∞C in July, and from 11.7 ¬∞C to 25.5 ¬∞C in January.

Construction and commissioning S-34 was laid down on 28 May 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 13 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Florence Hellman, and commissioned on 12 July 1922 with Lieutenant Elroy L. Vanderkloot in command. Service history The launching of S-34 on 13 February 1919. Following commissioning, S-34 was ordered to New London, Connecticut, for engineering alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company. Decommissioned on 25 October 1922, she was delivered to the company which completed the work in the spring of 1923. The submarine was recommissioned on 23 April; and, after further trials and various exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea, she returned to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego, California, her home port, on 6 August. For the next year and one-half, she remained based in southern California, then, in 1925, she was ordered to the Philippines. She departed from San Francisco, California, in mid-April, arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, P.I., on 12 July; and, after voyage repairs and an overhaul, commenced operations as a unit of the Asiatic Fleet. From then until 1932, she rotated between exercises, patrols, and overhauls in the Philippines during the winter and deployments to the China coast in the summer for operations out of Tsingtao. In 1932, she was ordered back to the eastern Pacific Ocean. She departed Manila on 2 May and headed for Pearl Harbor, whence she operated until April 1941. She then returned to San Diego. During the remaining months of peace, S-34 provided services for the West Coast Sound School. With the attack on Pearl Harbor, defensive patrol work off the West Coast was added to her duties. However, with the new year, 1942, she and other World War I design submarines were ordered prepared for service in the northern Pacific in defense of the Aleutian Islands. She underwent overhaul at Mare Island, and, in March, she moved north to the newly established submarine base at Dutch Harbor, Unalaska. On 12 April, she headed west on her first war patrol. First war patrol One day out, a heavy wave threw the quartermaster of the watch against the side of the bridge, and S-34 was forced to return to base to put the badly injured man ashore. Arriving on 14 April, she cleared the harbor again the same day and resumed her westward passage. On 15 April, engineering casualties and poor weather slowed her progress. The next day, the weather moderated, but intensified again on 18 April. On 20 April, she left the Bering Sea and entered the less violent, but fog shrouded, waters of the Kuril Islands. Two days later, off the entrance to Onekotan Strait she attacked her first enemy target, but failed to score. The next day, S-34 moved into the Sea of Okhotsk to take up her assigned station west of Paramushiro. Ice, two to five feet above the water, still covered the area and the boat retired through the strait to patrol on the Pacific side of the island. 24 April brought another unsuccessful attack on a merchantman and an attempt to close a warship. Two days later, the lookouts observed increased activity by enemy patrol planes. On 27 April, the S-boat again attempted to penetrate the ice, via Mushiru Strait. The same day, she returned to the Pacific; and, on 28 April she headed back to the Aleutians. She encountered mountainous seas in the Bering Sea; but by 1 May, she was at Attu Island. Thence, she continued on to Kiska; remained offshore on 2 May as a storm battered the island; and, on 3 May, she replenished and moved north to intercept any enemy submarines which might be heading for the Gulf of Alaska. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor. Refit as intelligence estimates predicting a Japanese thrust at Midway Island and the Aleutians were received, S-34 cleared Dutch Harbor on 28 May and stood west to patrol north of Attu. On 29 May, the Japanese Aleutian force sortied from Ominato and headed east, its approach to its target covered by fog and rain. On the morning of 3 June, Japanese planes bombed Dutch Harbor. Second war patrol From the start of her patrol until 11 June, S-34 remained in her assigned area, listening to reports, but sighting no enemy ships. On 11 June, she received news of the Japanese occupation of Kiska and orders to take \\"maximum offensive action.\\" She headed for Kiska. Diverted back to Dutch Harbor, she replenished on 12 June and got underway again the same day, but returned to Attu instead of going to Kiska. She reconnoitered Sarana Bay, Holtz Bay, and Chichagof Harbor; none showed any activity. On 17 June, she sighted a warship off the Semichi Islands, but could not close the range. She then returned to Attu and, on 20 June, sighted an enemy destroyer patrolling off Sarana Bay. Between 07:00 and 10:00, she sighted and lost the target twice as it moved in and out of the fog. At 11:55, she sighted a large tanker inside the bay. Fifty minutes later, she slipped past a destroyer guarding the entrance and began maneuvering into the bay. Her target was engaged in refueling another destroyer. At 13:50, S-34 grounded at a depth of 48 feet. Run up to 25 feet, she came out of the water to the waterline; then backed off into deep water. Within five minutes, she was operating at periscope depth. The fueling destroyer had gotten underway from alongside the tanker and was racing across the intervening waters. S-34 fired two torpedoes at the destroyer, forcing the enemy to swerve and pass down the submarine's port side. Unable then to bring her tubes to bear on the tanker, the S-boat swung right to avoid depth charges. At 14:03, she bottomed in 164 feet, just inside the entrance to the bay, where she remained until 23:30. During that time, only one destroyer was heard searching for her, the other, which had conducted the high speed attack, was heard pinging from the same spot for nine hours. She had presumably grounded after the attack, but, by 23:00, the tide had risen and she had moved to join in the search for the submarine. At 23:30, S-34 began to make her way out of the bay. Twenty minutes later, one of the destroyers located her. The pace of the hunt was stepped up, but the quarry evaded attempts to destroy her. By 02:30 on 21 June, she had maneuvered out of the bay, lost her pursuer; and set a course for Dutch Harbor. On 26 June, S-34 moored in Dutch Harbor, whence she proceeded to Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul and training duty. Third war patrol On 13 September, she returned to Unalaska, and, on 14 September, she departed from Dutch Harbor on her third war patrol. Two days later, she crossed the 180th meridian; and, on 17 September, she arrived in the Semichi area and commenced crossing the Japanese supply lanes to the western Aleutians in search of targets. On 20 September, while off Buldir, her after radio mast was partially carried away by heavy seas and threatened to foul the propellers and stern planes. Despite the heavy seas, Chief Machinist's Mate B.F. Allen went over the side; cut the wreckage adrift and rigged two forward wing antennas. On 21 September, the submarine resumed her patrol off Attu, reconnoitering the approaches to its harbors. On 26 September, she was ordered to Kiska, and, on the afternoon of 28 September, she sighted a minelayer off Kiska Harbor. The enemy, however, detected her presence before she could close the target. Destroyers joined the minelayer, and S-34 once again became the hunted. Forty minutes and 47 depth charges later, she cleared the immediate area. A week later, she sighted and closed a Kiska-bound enemy submarine; but, as the torpedoes were readied, depth control was lost; and she failed to score. On 8 October, she headed home, arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 October. Fourth war patrol Storms and heavy seas abounded in the western Aleutians during S-34‚Äôs fourth war patrol, 23 October to 21 November. Operating in and across the Japanese traffic routes from Kiska to Agattu and Attu and between Paramushiro and Attu, she sighted only one possible target, a submarine which disappeared before identification could be made. Fifth war patrol She got underway for her fifth war patrol on 5 December. On 9 December, she resumed operations to intercept Japanese shipping between the Kurils and the Aleutians. Twenty days later, she returned to Dutch Harbor. Overhaul In early January 1943, the S-boat sailed south. On 18 January, she arrived at San Diego where she remained until late April, undergoing overhaul; receiving radar, air conditioning, and improved communication and navigation equipment, and providing services to the West Coast Sound School. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor; and, on 13 May, she departed from that base to patrol again in the Kurils. Sixth war patrol By 22 May, S-34 was off Paramushiro and, for the next 12 days, she patrolled in the southern approaches to the island, and in Shumushu and Paramushiro strait. On the evening of the ninth day, she torpedoed and sank a small freighter off Torishimo Retto; and, on the evening of 3 June, she cleared the area. Seventh war patrol Arriving back at Dutch Harbor on 10 June, she departed again 11 days later. On 28 June, she approached the fog-bound Kurils; and, on 1 July, she moved toward the Kamchatka Peninsula to locate and destroy enemy fishing vessels operating near and north of Cape Lopatka. On 3 July, while she was charging, fire broke out in the port motor, but was quickly extinguished. Repairs were completed on 5 July; and, on 7 July, she moved into a new area, Onekotan Island. The next day, she returned to Paramushiro. On 13 July, she sighted two ships and commenced closing the targets despite poor visibility. Shortly after noon, she launched three torpedoes, but her crew heard only thuds as they struck the target. On 15 July, she moved back into Paramushiro Strait and, on 22 July set a course for Unalaska. Retirement Arriving on 30 July, she moved south in early August and, at mid-month, arrived at San Diego where she provided training services through the end of World War II. Then ordered inactivated, she proceeded to San Francisco where she was decommissioned on 23 October 1945. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the following month, and her hulk was sold for scrapping in 1946. S-34 received one battle star for her World War II service.

The word was an acronym for Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH (). Hollerith refers to the German- American inventor of the technology of punched cards, Herman Hollerith. In April 1949 the company name was changed to IBM Deutschland. Background A general-purpose punched card from the mid twentieth century. The technology of punched cards dates back to the 18th century when it was used for mass production of woven textiles and later used as a recording and playback system in player pianos. The use of punched cards for recording and tabulating data was first proposed and used by Semyon Korsakov around 1805. In 1832 Charles Babbage proposed using similar cards to program and to store computations for his calculating engine. Punched card technology was further developed for data-processing by Herman Hollerith from the 1880s. It was used for the 1890 United States Census and for the census work of several foreign governments. History Willy Heidinger, an acquaintance of Hollerith, licensed all of Hollerith‚Äôs The Tabulating Machine Company patents in 1910, and created Dehomag in Germany. In 1911 The Tabulating Machine Company was amalgamated (via stock acquisition) with three others, creating a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). In 1923 CTR acquired 90% ownership of Dehomag, thus acquiring patents developed by them. In 1924 CTR was renamed IBM. Holocaust Tabulating machine D11, the first universal numerical tabulating machine. Such machines were used by the Nazi German administration in organizing documents related to the Holocaust. As an IBM subsidiary, Dehomag became the main provider of computing expertise and equipment in Nazi Germany. Dehomag gave the German government the means for two official censuses of the population after 1933 and for searching its data. It gave the Nazis a way of tracing Jews and dissidents using the powerful automated search tools using the IBM machines. It enabled them to search databases rapidly and efficiently, and the methods were used throughout occupied Europe by the Gestapo and others to locate and arrest its victims, so contributing to the Holocaust. Dehomag leased and maintained the German government's punched card machines. Dehomag general manager for Germany, Hermann Rottke, reported to IBM President Thomas J. Watson in New York. It was legal for IBM to conduct business with Germany directly until the United States entered the war in December 1941. IBM New York established a special subsidiary in the occupied General Government territory, Watson Business Machines, to deal with railway traffic there during the Holocaust in Poland. The German Transport Ministry used IBM machines under the New York-controlled subsidiary in Warsaw, not the German subsidiary. Watson Business Machines operated a punch card printing shop near the Warsaw Ghetto. The punch cards bore the indicia of the German subsidiary Dehomag. Leon Krzemieniecki, the last surviving person involved in the administration of the rail transportation to Auschwitz and Treblinka, stated he knew the punched card machines were not German machines, because the labels were in English. Income from the machines leased in General Government was sent through Geneva to IBM in New York.

History  Prior to the 1960s, only trade schools co-existed with universities in the province of Ontario at the post-secondary level, most of which had been established primarily to help veterans reintegrate into society in the post- war years. Loyalist College was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create many such institutions to provide career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities. The name of the college reflects the area's original settlement by United Empire Loyalists. Originally operated out of a local high school, Loyalist College moved to its present campus on Wallbridge-Loyalist Road in 1968. The college operates a satellite campus in Bancroft, Ontario and is associated with First Nations Technical Institute in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory reserve.

It is 448.2 m (1467 ft) high. Its peaks are often found enveloped in purple and golden clouds at dawn and dusk, hence its name. A small mountain with an area of about 20 square kilometers (4,900 acres), Purple Mountain is a mountain related to many historical events of both ancient and modern China. It was originally known as Bell Mountain () and also became known as Mount Jiang () after Sun Quan named Jiang Ziwen, an Eastern Han official whose spirit was said to haunt the site, as the mountain's god during the Three Kingdoms era. The name Zijin () means \\"copper\\" - when copper is pure, it appears purple in color, so in Chinese, it is also called purple- gold. It is also named Mount Jinling (), due to its purple rocks. Jinling means \\"the mount of purple-gold\\". It is the origin of the nickname \\"Jinling\\" () of Nanjing. During the Ming dynasty, it was also called Mount Shenlie (). More than 200 heritage and scenic tourist sites are now located in or around the mountain, including three national historical sites, nine provincial historical sites, and 33 prefectural historical sites. Located in or close to the hillside of the mountain, there are also about a dozen national research institutes and universities.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones, Maurice Noble (credited as a co-director), and Abe Levitow. The short was released on December 29, 1962. It is a \\"one-off\\" tale about a sad and bored Martian who travels to Earth in search of happiness. He lands his spaceship in the state of Georgia, hence the title. Once there, he decides he must impart his knowledge upon Earthlings; indeed he believes this will bring him happiness. However, the people of Earth panic from the minute he lands, perceiving him as a monster. Ultimately, he realizes that he does not belong and returns home. The title is a pun on the song Marching Through Georgia. Plot The narrator, who speaks throughout the entire cartoon, opens the story by talking about a planet far off in space. On this planet, there is a race of Martians who are advanced and have happiness all throughout their lives, except for one Martian who is fed up with his homeworld's perfect society. Levitating in the air, passing through solid objects, and projecting images from his blue antenna do nothing but bore him. When an attractive female Martian offers to pitch some love to the Martian, he just turns her away, causing her to melt. The Martian then goes to see a psychiatrist, who recommends that he must travel to another world to cure his boredom. The Martian leaves the planet in a flying saucer that is launched by slingshot and sent deep into space. After some time (including punching a leaking hole in the Big Dipper), he enters the Earth's solar system and stops at Earth. Observing typical urban scenery and activities of the people on Earth (television antennas, people with huge and little cars, children watching Cowboys and Indians on TV, and teenagers dancing to jukebox tunes), the Martian decides he likes this planet and to land there, so he can bestow the people of Earth with his planet's more superior culture. As the Martian's flying saucer lands in Atlanta, Georgia, a crowd of people gather round the ship, and seeing the Martian, they run away screaming \\"Monster!\\" The Martian is confused about the monster everybody is talking about and gets arrested by the police for landing in a \\"no parking\\" zone. After he gets questioned by the authorities he is put in a jail cell, but the Martian leaves the cell by passing through the walls, causing the prison guard to cry out for his mother while he sounds the escape whistle. The next morning, a tall man and a short man are reading the newspapers about the Martian's escape. The tall man makes a comment about the Martian based on the newspaper's description (\\"Terrible thing, this raving alien monster, roaming the countryside, devouring innocent people, striking terror into the hearts of millions, and leaving behind a trail of chaos and destruction\\") to which the short man scolds \\"If you can't say anything nice about someone, you shouldn't say anything at all.\\" As the tall man walks away, the Martian goes up to the short man and hugs him, causing the short man to turn white with fright and call the Martian exactly the same description the tall man gave before fleeing in terror. Still confused about the \\"monster\\", the Martian vows to seek out and destroy it. As the Martian passes a construction site, he spots a steam shovel at work. Assuming that this is the monster everybody is talking about, he whips out a ray gun labeled as an ACME Atom Rearranger, and shoots the steam shovel, turning it into a dragon that licks the now white with fright construction worker that was operating it, and waddles off with him on its back. Satisfied that the \\"monster\\" has been destroyed, the Martian walks off confidently, eager to do more good deeds for Earth. As the Martian passes a red-haired boy reading a comic book, the boy says \\"Hello, monster\\" directly at the Martian. Confused as to what the boy just said, the Martian asks the boy if he really called him \\"monster\\", to which the boy nods, showing him something that he had found in his comic book: a page with a picture of the Martian that informs the reader that a space monster has no nose, which the Martian indeed does not have. The Martian gets the idea to remove his antenna and put it on his face to pass it off as a nose, but the boy leaves and says \\"Goodbye, monster.\\" Now realizing he is the monster, the Martian sinks back into depression and runs through a nightmarish landscape, a dark voice all around him calling him \\"monster\\" and berating him to go home. Just as the Martian ducks into an alley, the narrator recommends that the Martian could just commit suicide, since nobody loves him. The Martian takes out his ray gun and prepares to blow his brains out, when the narrator helps him remember that somebody does love him. Taking this advice to heart, the Martian puts his antenna back in place on his head and remembers the female Martian he had turned down earlier. As the narrator says someday, a new constellation will appear, the Martian, now wanting to seek happiness back on his home planet, blasts off back home, which is seen as a star in a constellation of stars that form a heart. The narrator concludes the story by saying that when this new constellation does appear, no one will ever be bored on the Martian's planet.

Many species are known as splitfins. This family contains about 50 species within 18 genera. The family is named after ichthyologist George Brown Goode (1851-1896). Distribution The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Goodeinae and the Empetrichthyinae. The Goodeinae are endemic to shallow freshwater habitats in Mexico, particularly along the Mesa Central area (especially the Lerma River basin, smaller rivers directly south of it and inland to around the Valley of Mexico region), with some species found in brackish fringes at the Pacific coast, and north to central Durango, central Sinaloa and north San Luis Potos√≠. There are about 45 species of Goodeinae in 16 genera (some list 2 additional genera). The Empetrichthyinae are found in the southwestern Great Basin in Nevada, the United States, and contains 4 species in 2 genera. Physical information The name \\"splitfin\\" comes from the fact that, in the male fish, the anterior rays of the anal fin are partly separated from rest of the fin. Splitfins can be up to in length, though most species are much smaller, around . Goodeid fish have internal fertilisation, with males positioning themselves with a flexible part of the front anal fin, separated by a notch, which makes up the andropodium. Embryos hatch out of the egg within the ovarian follicle, and possess trophotaeniae, ribbon-like structures that emerge from the cloaca in front of the anal fin, on the ventral surface of the juvenile. These allow the absorption of nutrients within the ovary (matrotrophy), and are shed by juveniles shortly after birth. Female goodeids do not store sperm, and so a copulation event must precede each pregnancy.Ellenberg, G. (2005) Goodeiden [Online]. Available: http://www.goodeiden.de Conservation status In recent years there has been a significant reduction in the range and size of Goodeid populations in this region, mainly due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution, eutrophication, habitat modification and desiccation; recent estimates put habitat loss at 80% compared to historic ranges.De la Vega-Salazar, M. Y. & Mac√≠as-Garc√≠a, C. (In press) Principal Factors in the decline of the Mexican endemic viviparous fishes (Goodeinae: Goodeidae). Ch. 33 in: H. J. Grier & M. C. Uribe (Eds.) Viviparous Fishes. Proceedings of I and II International Symposia. New Life Publications, Homestead FL, USA. The low economic importance of Goodeid fish to Mexican fisheries and industry has led to this family being largely ignored by conservation efforts, but their small size and the dedication of a small number of aquaria hobbyists has led to a recent increase in the amount of research dedicated to the family. These investigations have highlighted the implications for conservation efforts concerning other global freshwater ichthyofauna.

The family includes a number of popular aquarium fish, for example the redtail splitfin Xenotoca eiseni. Recent phylogenetic studies have put the age of this family at approximately 16.5 million years, with the majority of divergence occurring in the Miocene period. The speciosity of this family can be attributed to historical volcanic and geological disturbance in this region, which created suitable conditions for allopatric speciation of the fish.

Presentation It is usually found in men older than 55 years and is frequently found on bilateral testes but often asymmetrical. Mechanism The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the efferent ducts, which connect the rete testis with the head of the epididymis. They are often bilateral. Diagnosis The condition can be detected with ultrasonography. Cystic lesions us usually found at the mediastinum testis with elongated shaped lesion displacing the mediastinum. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as spermatocele, epididymal cyst, and epididymitis. The condition shares a common location with cystic dysplasia of the testis and intratesticular cysts. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers. Another distinguishing feature is that tubular ectasia of the testes are confined only to the mediastinum, unlike testicular cancer such as cystic teratoma of testis which spreads throughout the testis. Treatment Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.

The book dates from the mid-13th century; its name comes from its association with the Priory of St. John the Evangelist and Teulyddog at Carmarthen, and is referred to as black due to the colour of its binding. It is currently part of the collection of the National Library of Wales, where it is catalogued as NLW Peniarth MS 1. This was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c.1592‚Äì1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts. It is believed that the manuscript is first recorded when it came into the possession of Sir John Price of Brecon (1502?‚Äì1555), whose work was to search the monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII. It was given to him by the treasurer of St David's Cathedral, having come from Carmarthen Priory. Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin was described by William Forbes Skene (1809‚Äì92) as one of the Four Ancient Books of Wales. Description Written before 1250, the manuscript is a small (170 x 125 mm; 7 x 5 inches), incomplete, vellum codex of 54 folios (108 pages) in eight gatherings; several folios are missing. Although the product of a single scribe, inconsistency in the ruling of each folio, in the number of lines per folio, and in handwriting size and style, suggest an amateur writing over a long period of time. The opening folios, written in a large textura on alternating ruled lines, are followed by folios in a much smaller, cramped script. Contents Black Book of Carmarthen (f.29.v) The book contains a small group of triads about the horses of Welsh heroes, but is chiefly a collection of 9th‚Äì12th-century poetry falling into various categories: religious and secular subjects, and odes of praise and of mourning. Of greater interest are the poems which draw on traditions relating to the Welsh heroes associated with the Hen Ogledd (Old North, i.e. Cumbria and the surrounding area), and especially those connected with the legend of Arthur and Myrddin, also known as Merlin, thus predating the descriptions of Merlin by Geoffrey of Monmouth. One of the poems, The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin, refers to the \\"Battle of Llongborth\\", the location of which can no longer be pinpointed, and mentions Arthur's involvement in the battle. The poems Yr Afallennau and Yr Oianau describe the mad Merlin in a forest talking to an apple tree and a pig, prophesying the success or failure of the Welsh army in battles with the Normans in South Wales. Some of the other poems contained are: *Ymddiddan Myrddin a Thaliesin (A Conversation Between Merlin and Taliesin) *Dade y Corff are Enaid (Dialogue between the Body and the Soul) *Elegy to Madog ap Maredudd (d. 1160) *The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin *The Verses of the Graves *Kyntaw geir (a penitential poem on pilgrimage) *Gwerz Skolan Recent developments There has been a call from the editor of the Carmarthen Journal newspaper to house the Black Book in its native Carmarthen, so that it might be seen by locals and tourists coming into the town. In 2002, it was announced that the Black Book had been scanned, and made available online. In 2014 it was suggested an interactive display about the book could be created in Carmarthen's St Peter's Church. In March 2015, University of Cambridge Professor Paul Russell and Ph.D. student Myriah Williams reported that a variety of imaging techniques such as ultraviolet lamps and photo- editing software had revealed content that had been invisible under normal viewing conditions. Among the previously unknown material, erased half a millennium ago, were extensive marginal annotations, including an inscription suggesting that the book was gifted by a previous owner to a family member; drawings of a fish and of two human faces; and a previously unattested Welsh poem.

Ever since a revival concert series in the 2010 Bregenz Festival in Austria, his music has been increasingly described as \\"some of the most individual and compelling music of the twentieth century\\".Description on Toccata Classics CD TOCC 0193 (2014). Weinberg's output was extensive, encompassing 26 symphonies, 17 string quartets, nearly 30 sonatas for various instruments, 7 operas, and numerous film scores. Names Much confusion has been caused by different renditions of the composer's names. In official Polish documents (i.e. prior to his move to the USSR), his name was spelled as Mojsze Wajnberg, and in the world of Yiddish theater of antebellum Warsaw he was likewise known as (Moishe Weinberg). In the Russian language (i.e. after his move to the Soviet Union), he was and still is known as (Moisey Samuilovich Vaynberg), which is the Russian-language analogue of the Polish original Mojsze, son of Samuel. Among close friends in Russia, he would also go by his Polish diminutive Mietek (i.e. Mieczys≈Çaw). Re-transliteration of his surname from Cyrillic (–í–∞–π–Ω–±–µ—Ä–≥) back into the Latin alphabet produced a variety of spellings, including 'Weinberg', 'Vainberg', and 'Vaynberg'. The form 'Weinberg' is now being increasingly used as the most frequent English-language rendition of this common Jewish surname, notably in the latest edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and by Weinberg's first biographer, Per Skans.Skans, Per. Quoted on http://www.music-weinberg.net/. See also: Danuta Gwizdalanka: Mieczys≈Çaw Wajnberg - kompozytor z trzech ≈õwiat√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ 2013, with his signatures in Russian and Polish on p. 52. Life Early life in Poland, Belarus and Uzbekistan Weinberg was born on 8 December 1919 to a Jewish family in Warsaw. His father, Shmil (Szmuel or Samuil Moiseyevich) Weinberg (1882‚Äì1943, Russian), a well-known conductor and composer of the Yiddish theater, moved to Warsaw from Kishinev (at that time a part of the Russian Empire) in 1916 and worked as a violinist and conductor for the Yiddish theatre Scala in Warsaw, where the future composer joined him as pianist at the age of 10 and later as a musical director of several performances. His mother, Sonia Wajnberg (n√©e Sura-Dwojra Sztern, 1888‚Äì1943), born in Odessa (at that time a part of the Russian Empire), was an actress in several Yiddish theater companies in Warsaw and Lodz. The family had already been the victim of anti-semitic violence in Bessarabia - some members of his family were killed during the Kishinev pogrom.Skans, Per (2004) Notes to Symphonies Volume 2, Chandos, p. 4. One of the composer's cousins (a son of his father's sister Khaya Vaynberg) - Isay Abramovich Mishne - was the secretary of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Baku Soviet commune and was executed in 1918 along with the other 26 Baku Commissars. Weinberg entered the Warsaw Conservatory at the age of twelve, studying piano under J√≥zef Turczy≈Ñski, and graduated in 1939. Two works (his first string quartet and a berceuse for piano) were composed before he fled to the Soviet Union at the outbreak of World War II. His parents and younger sister Esther, who remained behind, were interned at the Lodz ghetto and subsequently perished in the Trawniki concentration camp. Weinberg first settled in Minsk, where he studied composition under Vasily Zolotarev for the first time at the Conservatory there. At the outbreak of World War II on Soviet territory, Weinberg was evacuated to Tashkent (Central Asia), where he wrote works for the opera, as well as met and married Solomon Mikhoels' daughter Natalia Vovsi. There he also met Dmitri Shostakovich who was impressed by his talent and became his close friend. Meeting Shostakovich had a profound effect on the younger man, who said later that, \\"It was as if I had been born anew\\".Nikitina, Lyudmilla Dmitriyevna (2009), \\"Weinberg [Vaynberg], Moisey [Mieczys≈Çaw] Samuilovich\\", Grove Music Online, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.29094 In 1943, he moved to Moscow at Shostakovich's urging. Later life in Russia Once in Moscow, Weinberg began to settle down and to work energetically, as evidenced by his increasing opus numbers: approximately 30 works from 1943 until 1948. Several of Weinberg's works were banned during the Zhdanovshchina of 1948, and, as a result, he was almost entirely ignored by the Soviet musical establishment; for a time he could make a living only by composing for the theatre and circus. On 13 January 1948 Weinberg's father-in-law Mikhoels was assassinated in Minsk on Stalin's orders; shortly after Mikhoels's murder, Soviet agents began following Weinberg. In February 1953, he was arrested on charges of \\"Jewish bourgeois nationalism\\" in relation to the murder of his father-in-law as a part of the so-called \\"Doctors' plot\\": Shostakovich allegedly wrote to Lavrenti Beria to intercede on Weinberg's behalf, as well as agreeing to look after Weinberg's daughter if his wife were also arrested. In the event, he was saved by Stalin's death the following month, and he was officially rehabilitated shortly afterwards.Wilson, Elizabeth (2006), \\"Shostakovich: A Life Remembered\\", Faber, pp. 227-231. Thereafter Weinberg continued to live in Moscow, composing and occasionally performing as a pianist. He and Shostakovich lived near to one another, sharing ideas on a daily basis. Besides the admiration which Shostakovich frequently expressed for Weinberg's works, they were taken up by some of Russia's foremost performers and conductors, including Emil Gilels, Leonid Kogan, Kirill Kondrashin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Kurt Sanderling, and Thomas Sanderling. Final years and posthumous reception Towards the end of his life, Weinberg suffered from Crohn's disease and remained housebound for the last three years, although he continued to compose. He converted to Orthodox Christianity on 3 January 1996, less than two months before his death in Moscow.Reilly, Robert R. (February 2000), \\"Light in the Dark: The Music of Mieczyslaw Vainberg\\", Crisis Magazine, reproduced at http://www.music-weinberg.net/biography.html. His funeral was held in the Church of the Resurrection of the Word. A 2004 reviewer has considered him as \\"the third great Soviet composer, along with Prokofiev and Shostakovich\\".Steve Schwarz, review of The Golden Key on Classical Net Review, 2004. Ten years after his death, a concert premiere of his opera The Passenger in Moscow sparked a posthumous revival. The British director David Pountney staged the opera at the 2010 Bregenz Festival and restaged it at English National Opera in 2011. Thomas Sanderling has called Weinberg \\"a great discovery. Tragically, a discovery, because he didn‚Äôt gain much recognition within his lifetime besides from a circle of insiders in Russia.\\" Conversion to Christianity Posthumously, Weinberg's conversion to Christianity has been the subject of some controversy. In particular, Weinberg's first and older daughter, Victoria, questioned in an interview from 2016 whether his baptism was undertaken voluntarily in light of his long- standing illness, and in his book on the composer, David Fanning alludes to rumors that Weinberg was baptised under pressure from his second wife, Olga Rakhalskaya.Fanning, David (2010), \\"Mieczyslaw Weinberg: In Search of Freedom\\", Wolke Verlagsges. . However, Olga Rakhalskaya has subsequently replied to these allegations by stating that involuntary baptism (under pressure or when mentally incapacitated) is sinful and of no value, and that Weinberg had been considering his conversion for about a year before he asked to be baptised in late November 1995. The composer's younger daughter, Anna Weinberg, has written that \\"father was baptized in sound mind and firm memory, without the slightest pressure from any side; this was his deliberate and conscious decision, and why he did it is not for us to judge.\\". It is quite possible that the composer's interest in Christianity began when working on the film score for Boris Yermolaev's \\"–û—Ç—á–µ –ù–∞—à\\" (Otche Nash, \\"Our Father in Heaven\\") in the late 1980s. A setting of the Lord's Prayer appears in the manuscript version of Weinberg's last completed symphony (No. 21, 1991), subtitled \\"Kaddish\\".Fanning, David (2014), Notes to Symphony 21, Toccata Classics CD TOCC 0193. Works Weinberg's output includes twenty-two symphonies, other works for orchestra (including four chamber symphonies and two sinfoniettas), seventeen string quartets, eight violin sonatas (three solo and five with piano), twenty-four preludes for cello and six cello sonatas (two with piano and four solo), four solo viola sonatas, six piano sonatas, numerous other instrumental works, as well as more than 40 film and animation scores (including The Cranes are Flying, Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, 1958). He wrote seven operas, and considered one of them, The Passenger (Passazhirka) (written in 1967-68, premiered in 2006),World premiere (in concert version): December 25, 2006, Moscow International House of Music Scenic premiere: July 21, 2010, Bregenz Festival to be his most important work. The British record label Olympia was among the first to raise general awareness of Weinberg in the late 1990s and early 2000s through a series of seventeen compact disc recordings of his music (plus one sampler disc), consisting of both original recordings and re-masterings of earlier Melodiya LPs. Since then, numerous other labels have recorded Weinberg's music, including Naxos, Chandos, ECM and Deutsche Grammophon. Weinberg's works sometimes have a strong element of commemoration, with reference to his formative years in Warsaw and to the war which ended that earlier life. Typically, however, this darkness serves as a background to the finding of peace through catharsis. This desire for harmony is also evident in his musical style; Lyudmilla Nikitina emphasizes the \\"neo-classical, rationalist clarity and proportion\\" of his works. More generally, Weinberg's style can be described as modern yet accessible. His harmonic language is usually based on an expanded/free tonality mixed with occasional polytonality (e.g. as in the Twentieth Symphony) and atonality (e.g. as in the Twelfth String Quartet or the 24 Preludes for Solo Cello). His earlier works exhibit neo-Romantic tendencies and draw significantly on folk-music, whereas his later works, which came with improved social circumstances and greater compositional maturity, are more complex and austere. However, even in these later, more experimental works from the late 1960s, 70s and 80s (e.g. the Third Violin Sonata or the Tenth Symphony), which make liberal use of tone clusters and other devices, Weinberg retains a keen sense of tradition that variously manifests itself in the use of classical forms, more restrained tonality, or lyrical melodic lines. Always masterfully crafted, many of his instrumental works contain highly virtosic writing and make significant technical demands on performers. Shostakovich and stylistic influences Although he never formally studied with Shostakovich, the older composer had an obvious influence on Weinberg's music. This is particularly noticeable in his Twelfth Symphony (1975‚Äì1976, Op. 114), which is dedicated to the memory of Shostakovich and quotes from a number of the latter's works. Other explicit connections include the pianissimo passage with celesta which ends the Fifth Symphony (1962, Op. 76), reminiscent of Shostakovich's Fourth; the quote from one of Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues in Weinberg's Sixth Piano Sonata (1960, Op. 73); and numerous, strung-together quotes from Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto and Cello Sonata (4th movement) in Weinberg's 21st Prelude for Solo Cello. These explicit connections should not be interpreted, however, to mean that musical influences went in only one direction (from Shostakovich to Weinberg). Indeed, Shostakovich drew significant inspiration from Weinberg's Seventh Symphony for his Tenth String Quartet; Shostakovich also drew on some of the ideas in Weinberg's Ninth String Quartet for the slow movement of his Tenth Quartet (opening bars of Weinberg's Ninth), for his Eleventh Quartet (first movement of Weinberg's Ninth) and for his Twelfth Quartet (F-sharp major ending)Fanning, David (2010), Notes to String Quartets Vol. 4, CPO CD 777 394-2, p. 15.; and in his First Cello Concerto of 1959, Shostakovich re- used Weinberg's idea of a solo cello motif in the first movement that recurs at the end of the work to impart unity, from Weinberg's Cello Concerto (1948, Op. 43).Fanning, David (2012), Notes to Cello Concerto and Symphony 20, Chandos CD CHSA 5107, pp. 5 - 6. It is also important to note that Weinberg does not restrict himself to quoting Shostakovich. For example, Weinberg's Trumpet Concerto quotes Mendelssohn's well-known Wedding March; his Second Piano Sonata (written in 1942, before moving to Moscow) quotes Haydn; and his Twenty First Symphony quotes a Chopin ballade. Such cryptic quotations are stylistic features shared by both Weinberg and Shostakovich. The discussion above highlights that mutual influences and stylistic affinities can be found in many works by the two composers, no doubt as a result of their close friendship and similar compositional views (see also Elphick, Daniel (2019), \\"Music Behind the Iron Curtain: Weinberg and his Polish Contemporaries\\", Cambridge University Press.). More general similarities in musical language between Shostakovich and Weinberg include the use of extended melodies, repetitive themes, and methods of developing the musical material.Nikitina, Lyudmilla (1994), \\"–ü–æ—á—Ç–∏ –ª—é–±–æ–π –º–∏–≥ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ ‚Äî —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞‚Ä¶\\" [\\"Almost every moment of my life is work\\"], –ú—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è [Journal of the Academy of Music] No. 5, pp. 17-24. However, Nikitina states that \\"already in the 60s it was obvious that Weinberg's style was individual and essentially different from the style of Shostakovich.\\". Along with Shostakovich, Nikitina identifies Prokofiev, Myaskovsky, Bart√≥k and Mahler as formative influences. Ethnic influences include not only Jewish music, but also Moldavian, Polish, Uzbek, and Armenian elements. Weinberg has been identified by a number of critics as the source of Shostakovich's own increased interest in Jewish themes.

The Rif region is mountainous and has some fertile plains, and stretches from Cape Spartel and Tangier in the west to Berkan and the Melwiyya River in the east and from the Mediterranean in the north to the Wergha river in the south. It is separated into Eastern Rif (Nador, Driouch, Alhucemas) and Western Rif (Tangier, Titouan, Chefchaouen, Taounate). Etymology Arif might mean \\"the coast\\" or \\"the edge of the land\\" in Berber. Geography Geologically the Rif mountains belong to the Gibraltar Arc or Albor√°n Sea geological region. They are an extension of the Baetic System that includes the mountains of the southern Iberian Peninsula across the strait. Thus the Rif mountains are not part of the Atlas Mountain System. Major cities in the greater Rif region include Nador, Berkane, Tangier, Tetouan, Al Hoceima (also called Villa), Imzouren, Driouch, Ben Taieb, Midar , Al aaroui and a few (small) towns Segangan, Selwan, Ajdir, Targuist (Targist).  History  The Rif has been inhabited by Berbers since prehistoric times. As early as the 11th century BC, the Phoenicians began to establish trading posts, with approval of or partnership with the local Berbers and started interbreeding thus starting a Punic language, on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, and founded cities such as Tetouan, Melilla (Rusadir) and, in the 5th century BC, Tangier (called Tingi, back then). Later the Phoenician power gave way to an independent Carthage city-state, as the major power in the region. After the Third Punic War, Carthage was supplanted by Rome, and the Rif became part of the province of Mauretania. When the latter was divided during the rule of Emperor Claudius, Tangier became the capital of Mauretania Tingitana. In the 5th century AD, the region was raided by the Vandals, and Roman rule came to an end. The region remained under Vandal control until the 6th century AD when the Byzantines reconquered parts of it. Flag of the Rif Republic (1921‚Äì1926) In 710, Salih I ibn Mansur founded the kingdom of Nekor in the Rif and Berbers started converting to Islam. Berber Muslim kingdoms started establishing more cities. By the 15th century, many Spanish Moors were exiled from Spain and most of them settled in Western Rif, bringing their culture, Andalusian music, and even establishing the city of Ashawen or Chefchaouen (Accawen meaning \\"horns\\" in Berber). Since then, the Rif has suffered numerous battles between Berber kingdoms, Spain and Portugal. In 1415, Portugal invaded Ceuta (Sebta), and in 1490 Spain invaded Melilla (Mlilt). There was a period of peace afterwards, but war between Spain and Morocco broke out again in 1859 in Tetouan, where Morocco was defeated. The Spanish-Moroccan conflicts continued in the 20th century, under the leadership of Abd el-Krim, the Berber guerrilla leader who proclaimed the Republic of the Rif in 1921. The Riffian Berbers won several victories over the Spanish in the Rif War of the 1920s before being eventually defeated. The region was added to Morocco's reign by Spain in April 1956, a month after the former gained its independence from France.  Environment  Rif mountains in the province of Ashawen Moroccan Mediterranean coast - aerial view west from Bades over El Jebha to T√©touan with Rif mountains, Tanger- Tetouan-Al Hoceima (2014) According to C. Michael Hogan, there are between five and eight separate subpopulations of the endangered primate Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 The Rif mountains are also home to the honey bee subspecies Apis mellifera major. The Rif region receives more rainfall than any other region in Morocco, with some portions receiving upwards of of precipitation a year. The western and central portions are more rainy and are covered in forests of Atlas cedar, cork oak and holm oak, as well as the only remaining forests of Moroccan fir, a subspecies of the Spanish fir. The eastern slopes receive less rainfall, and there forests consist mainly of pines, particularly the Aleppo pine and the maritime pine, as well as tetraclinis. Massive deforestation due to overgrazing, forest fires, and forest clearing for agriculture, particularly for the creation of cannabis plantations, has taken place over the last 60 years. This deforestation has led to soil degradation due to the washing away of topsoil, which has aggravated the process.

It is the counterpart of the rete ovarii in females.Definition: Rete ovarii from Online Medical Dictionary Its function is to provide a site for fluid reabsorption. Structure Micrograph of the rete testis. H&E; stain. The rete testis is the network of interconnecting tubules where the straight seminiferous tubules (the terminal part of the seminiferous tubules) empty. It is located within a highly vascular connective tissue in the mediastinum testis. The epithelial cells form a single layer that lines the inner surface of the tubules. These cells are cuboidal, with microvilli and a single cilium on their surface. Development In the development of the urinary and reproductive organs, the testis is developed in much the same way as the ovary, originating from mesothelium as well as mesonephros. Like the ovary, in its earliest stages it consists of a central mass covered by a surface epithelium. In the central mass, a series of cords appear. These cords run together toward the future hilum and form a network that ultimately becomes the rete testis. Function It appears the function of the rete testis is to mix the sperm as they leave the seminiferous tubules. Sperm leave the seminiferous tubules in the dilute secretions of Sertoli cells. The rete testis does modify the luminal fluids with a limited amount of secretion and reabsorption, but their primary function is to mix and transport the sperm into the efferent ductules, where the major function is reabsorption of about 95% of the fluid, which increases the sperm concentration prior to entering the epididymis. Clinical significance Rete tubular ectasia is a disorder of the rete testis characterized by multiple benign cysts. Etymology English uses the New Latin name for the structure, which simply means \\"network of the testis\\".

He was a first cousin of George Fant, the actor and director. Gunnar Fant received a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from KTH in 1945. He specialized in the acoustics of the human voice, measuring formant values, and continued to work in this area at Ericsson and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also took the initiative of creating a speech communication department at KTH, unusual at the time. Fant's work led to the birth of a new era of speech synthesis with the introduction of powerful and configurable formant synthesizers. In 1960 he published the source-filter model of speech production, which became widely used. In the 1960s, Gunnar Fant's Orator Verbis Electris (OVE) competed with Walter Lawrence's Parametric Artificial Talker (PAT) in creating lifelike speech synthesis. In later years, Gunnar Fant remained active in the area of speech synthesis, focusing mainly on research on prosody. Fant received honorary doctorates from the Grenoble University (1978) and from Stockholm University (1988), and several other awards. In 1989, he was the inaugural recipient Scientific Achievement Medal of the International Speech Communication Association. He also received the Swedish Academy Margit P√•hlson award, and the IEEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award (2003).

Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, Joe Pantoliano, and Philip Baker Hall play supporting roles. A critical and commercial success, the film was followed by The Midnight Run Action Pack in 1994, three made for television sequels which did not feature any of the principal actors, although a few characters are carried over from the first film. Plot Bounty hunter Jack Walsh is enlisted by bail bondsman Eddie Moscone to bring accountant Jonathan \\"The Duke\\" Mardukas back to Los Angeles. The accountant had embezzled $15 million from Chicago mob boss Jimmy Serrano before skipping on the $450,000 bail Moscone had posted for him. Walsh must bring Mardukas back within five days, or Moscone defaults. Moscone says the job is easy, a \\"midnight run\\", but Walsh demands $100,000. Walsh is then approached by FBI Agent Alonzo Mosely, who wants Mardukas to be a witness against Serrano and orders Walsh to keep away from Mardukas. Walsh takes no notice of this and instead steals Mosely's ID, which he uses to pass himself off as an FBI agent along his journey. Serrano's henchmen Tony and Joey offer Walsh $1 million to turn Mardukas over to them, but he turns them down. Walsh captures Mardukas in New York City and calls Moscone from the airport, not knowing that Moscone's line is tapped by the FBI and that his assistant Jerry is secretly tipping off Serrano's men. However, Mardukas fakes a panic attack on the plane, forcing the two men to travel via train. When Walsh and Mardukas fail to show up in Los Angeles on time, Moscone brings in rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler to find them. Dorfler tracks them to the train and attempts to take The Duke from Walsh, but Walsh gets the drop on him and leaves the train. However, he discovers when he attempts to purchase bus tickets with a credit card that Dorfler canceled the card. Without funds, he is forced to rely on other means to get across the country, including stealing cars, borrowing his ex-wife's car in Chicago, and hitchhiking. Meanwhile, word of the skirmish on the train reaches Mosely's ears and he leads a task force to find Walsh and Mardukas. Walsh eventually reveals that, 10 years before, he was an undercover officer in Chicago trying to get close to a drug dealer who had almost the entire police force on his payroll. Eventually, just as Jack was going to bust the dealer, he had heroin planted in his house by corrupt cops. In order to avoid either going to prison or working for the dealer, Walsh resigned from the force, left Chicago and became a bounty hunter, while his wife divorced him and married a corrupt lieutenant. Since then, however, Walsh has clung to the vain hope that he will one day be reunited with his ex-wife. Later, Mardukas learns that the drug dealer was Serrano, with Walsh not caring about the likelihood of Mardukas getting murdered by the man who ruined Walsh's life. In Arizona, Dorfler takes Mardukas away from Walsh, who is later found by Mosely and arrested. In Mosely's custody, Walsh is allowed his right to make phone calls and while arguing with Moscone over the phone, Walsh realizes that Dorfler intends to turn Mardukas over to Serrano for $2 million. However, Dorfler accidentally reveals to Serrano's men where he is keeping Mardukas and is knocked unconscious by Serrano's men, who go after Mardukas themselves. Walsh calls Serrano's men and bluffs that he has computer disks created by Mardukas with enough information to put Serrano away, but promises to hand the disks over if Serrano returns Mardukas to him unharmed. Jack arranges a deal with Mosely to frame Serrano in turn for his release and to allow him to deliver Mardukas to Moscone. He meets up with Serrano while wearing a wire and being watched by the FBI. Dorfler spots Mardukas and interrupts the exchange, unknowingly disabling the wire. After Serrano takes the disks, the FBI closes in, arresting Serrano and his henchmen. Mosely turns Mardukas over to Walsh with enough time to return him to Los Angeles before midnight. However, Walsh calls Moscone to confirm he's made the deadline, then promptly lets Mardukas go. Before parting, Walsh gives Mardukas the watch his wife gave him before their marriage. In return, Mardukas gives Walsh $300,000 in a money belt he had been hiding, insisting that it is a 'gift' not a payoff‚Äîsince Walsh had already chosen to let him go. Walsh accepts and flags down a taxi, asking the driver if he has change for a $1,000 bill, but the taxi drives away, so he heads home on foot.

He pursued the lead role in Penny Marshall's film, Big. Marshall was interested, but the studio was not, so the role went to Tom Hanks. Martin Brest, who directed Beverly Hills Cop, had developed a script with George Gallo that blended elements of comedy and action. Gallo says he based the relationship between Jack and the Duke on his own parents. \\"I don't think they ever realized how funny they were when they were arguing about something\\", he said. \\"My father was very emotional whereas my mother was far more calculating. She would let him talk and lead him down alleys and then strike like a cat.\\" Gallo paid tribute to Martin Brest, saying \\"Marty was highly focused, where I was a bit more all over the place. I'm not a person who suffers from not having ideas. If anything, I have too many ideas. Marty helped rein me in to stay focused on the main story. This has helped me a great deal since my collaboration with him.\\" Paramount Pictures was originally interested in backing Midnight Run, but they wanted a big name star opposite De Niro in order to improve the film's chances at the box office. Their production executives suggested that the Mardukas character be changed to a woman and wanted Cher for the role in the hope she would provide some \\"sexual overtones\\". When Brest rejected the idea, Paramount suggested teaming De Niro up with Robin Williams, who became eager to get the role and offered to audition for Brest. At one stage Bruce Willis was mentioned as a possible co star. Brest was impressed by Grodin's audition with De Niro, however, feeling that there was a real chemistry between the two actors. As a result, Paramount backed out and their UIP partner Universal Studios became interested in the project. Paramount president Ned Tanen claimed that the budget became too high and he decided that \\"it wasn't worth it\\". Universal executive Casey Silver had worked with Brest on Beverly Hills Cop and he was integral in setting up the project at Universal. To research for his role, De Niro worked with real-life bounty hunters and police officers. As Walsh uncuffs Mardukas on the train, the latter says, \\"Thanks, 'cause they're starting to cut into my wrists.'\\" In fact, Grodin has permanent scars resulting from the handcuffs he had to wear for most of the film. The scene where Mardukas falls off a cliff was shot on location in the Salt River Canyon in White Mountain, Arizona and the conclusion, taking place in rapids, was shot in New Zealand because the water was too cold in Arizona. \\"I trusted Marty would choose the material that was most suited for the scene\\", said De Niro. \\"He's aware of everything in Chuck's style, in my style. He had to balance all that, and I think he did it very well.\\" Yaphet Kotto remembers the film being a difficult shoot. > DeNiro is very spontaneous and it always helps to work with an artist like > that. But Marty Brest! \\"Herr Director\\" shot so many takes of the scenes that > I lost all joy in doing the film. It became hard and tedious work. Then he > stopped eating during the shoot and became thinner and thinner each day, > until he looked like a ghost behind the camera.

I > got sick and for the whole of the film I had a fever and was under the > weather for most of it ... I was shocked when it came off so funny ... It > sure wasn't funny making it.\\"Yaphet Kotto\\" at Cult Film Freak Universal invested $15 million in a print and television advertising campaign.

Reception Box office Midnight Run was released on July 20, 1988, in 1,158 theaters, grossing US$5.5 million in its opening weekend. It went on to make $38.4 million in North America and $43.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $81.6 million. Reviews Midnight Run has a 94% score at Rotten Tomatoes based on 50 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote, \\"What Midnight Run does with these two characters is astonishing, because it's accomplished within the structure of a comic thriller ... It's rare for a thriller to end with a scene of genuinely moving intimacy, but this one does, and it earns it.\\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances: \\"De Niro has the time of his acting life lightening up and sending up all those raging bulls that won him all those Oscars ... Charles Grodin, master of the double-take and maestro of the slow burn, the best light character comic since Jack Benny stopped playing himself\\". Vincent Canby, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, \\"Mr. De Niro and Mr. Grodin are lunatic delights, which is somewhat more than can be said for the movie, whose mechanics keep getting in the way of the performances\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson says of the director that, \\"carrying the dead weight of George Gallo's script, Brest isn't up to the strenuous task of transforming his uninspired genre material in something deeper, and so the attempts to mix pathos with comedy strike us merely as wild and disorienting vacillations in tone\\". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, \\"The outline of George Gallo's script‚Äîodd-couple antagonists become buddies under perilous circumstances‚Äîwas stale five years ago, and the outcome offers no surprises. Too bad: a lot of good work has been wasted on an unworthy cause\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Legacy George Gallo put the success of the movie down to the relationship between Jack and the Duke. > In many ways it is a love story, although it is one that is short lived. > They meet each other, take an instant dislike to one another and over time > grow to respect each other which leads to deeper feelings. Both men realize, > despite their differences, that they share core beliefs of what is right and > wrong. Audiences also think that the road trip angle to the story rings > true. Everyone who has ever gone on a long road trip knows that things can > go wrong and, as a result, adults can be reduced to behaving like children. > No matter how well a script is written, it has to be fully realized by the > director and actors. Every last person working on the film did a terrific > job. De Niro attributed a lot of the film's eventual success to Charles Grodin. \\"The way Chuck Grodin is, it worked\\", he said. \\"His character was irritating and Chuck knew how to do that, to work that. I felt like that was a good way to go.\\" Sequels  Television  * Another Midnight Run * Midnight Runaround * Midnight Run for Your Life See also * List of American films of 1988 References External links   * Category:1988 films Category:English-language films Category:1980s action comedy films Category:1980s buddy films Category:1980s crime comedy films Category:1980s road movies Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:American buddy films Category:American chase films Category:American crime comedy films Category:American comedy thriller films Category:American road movies Category:Films directed by Martin Brest Category:Films scored by Danny Elfman Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American buddy cop films Category:Buddy comedy films Category:1980s buddy cop films Category:1980s chase films Category:1988 comedy films ","title":"Midnight Run"},{"id":"1122032","title":"Division of Flinders"},{"id":"1122043","text":"Histrionic may refer to: * related to or reminiscent of (theatrical) acting, or acting out * Histrionic personality disorder, a Cluster B personality disorder * Histrionics (album), by The Higher * Histrionicus, a genus of ducks See also * Histrionicotoxin, toxins found in the skin of poison frogs ","title":"Histrionic"},{"id":"1122051","text":"Into the Wild is a 1996 non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It is an expansion of a 9,000-word article by Krakauer on Chris McCandless titled \\"Death of an Innocent\\", which appeared in the January 1993 issue of Outside. The book was adapted to a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Sean Penn with Emile Hirsch starring as McCandless. Into the Wild is an international bestseller which has been printed in 30 languages and 173 editions and formats. The book is widely used as high school and college reading curriculum. Into the Wild has been lauded by many reviewers but has also been described by Alaskan reporter Craig Medred as being \\"something invented\\" by its author. Background Christopher Johnson McCandless grew up in suburban Annandale, Virginia. After graduating in May 1990 with high grades from Emory University, McCandless ceased communicating with his family, gave away his college fund of $24,500 to Oxfam, and began traveling across the Western United States, later abandoning his 1982 Datsun after a flash flood. On April 28, 1992, McCandless hitchhiked to the Stampede Trail in Alaska. There he headed down the snow-covered trail to begin an odyssey with only 10 pounds (4500 g) of rice, a .22 caliber rifle, several boxes of rifle rounds, a camera, and a small selection of reading material‚Äîincluding a field guide to the region's edible plants, Tana'ina Plantlore. He declined an acquaintance's offer to buy him sturdier clothing and better supplies. McCandless perished sometime around the week of August 18, 1992, after surviving for 113 days. Summary On September 6, 1992, Christopher McCandless' body was found in an abandoned bus at on the Stampede Trail in Alaska. One year later, author Jon Krakauer retraced McCandless' steps during the two years between college graduation and his demise in Alaska. McCandless shed his legal name early in his journey, adopting the moniker \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", after W.H. Davies. He spent time in Carthage, South Dakota, laboring for months in a grain elevator owned by Wayne Westerberg before hitchhiking to Alaska. Krakauer interprets McCandless' intensely ascetic personality as possibly influenced by the writings of Henry David Thoreau and McCandless' favorite writer, Jack London. He explores the similarities between McCandless' experiences and motivations, and his own as a young man, recounting in detail Krakauer's own attempt to climb Devils Thumb in Alaska. Krakauer also relates the stories of some other young men who vanished into the wilderness, such as Everett Ruess, an artist and wanderer who went missing in the Utah desert during 1934, at age 20. In addition, he describes at some length the grief and puzzlement of McCandless' parents, sister Carine, and friends. Cause of death McCandless survived for approximately 113 days in the Alaskan wilderness, foraging for edible roots and berries, shooting an assortment of game‚Äîincluding a moose‚Äîand keeping a journal. Although he planned to hike to the coast, the boggy terrain of summer proved too difficult, and he decided instead to camp in a derelict camping bus left behind by a road construction company. In July he tried to leave, only to find the route blocked by the Teklanika river raging with snow-melt. On July 30, McCandless wrote a journal entry which read, \\"Extremely Weak. Fault Of Pot[ato] Seed\\".Into the Wild, p. 189 Based on this entry, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless had been eating what he thought was the roots of an edible plant, Hedysarum alpinum, commonly known as wild Eskimo potato, which are sweet and nourishing in the spring but become too tough to eat in the summer, perhaps forcing McCandless to eat the H. alpinum's seeds instead. Krakauer first speculated that the seeds were actually from Hedysarum mackenzii, or wild sweet pea, instead of the Eskimo potato, which contained a poisonous alkaloid, possibly swainsonine (the toxic chemical in locoweed) or something similar. In addition to neurological symptoms, such as weakness and loss of coordination, the poison causes starvation by blocking nutrient metabolism in the body. However, Krakauer later suggested that McCandless had not confused the two plants and had in fact actually eaten H. alpinum. Krakauer had the H. alpinum seeds tested for toxins and, through tests on Hendysarum alpinum, it was discovered that it contained an unidentifiable form of toxin. According to Krakauer, a well- nourished person might consume the seeds and survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless was likely unable to fend off the toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety Rhizoctonia leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. Rhizoctonia leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have contributed to McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable to get out of bed and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous. In March 2015, Krakauer co-authored a scientific analysis of the Hedysarum alpinum seeds McCandless ate. The report found relatively high levels of L-canavanine (an antimetabolite toxic to mammals) in the H. alpinum seeds and concluded \\"it is highly likely that the consumption of H. alpinum seeds contributed to the death of Chris McCandless.\\"Krakauer, J., et al. (2015). \\"Presence of l-canavanine in Hedysarum alpinum seeds and its potential role in the death of Chris McCandless.\\" Wilderness & Environmental Medicine.  Major themes  Into the Wild addresses the issues of how to be accepted into society, and how finding oneself sometimes conflicts with being an active member in society. Most critics agree that Chris McCandless left to find some sort of enlightenment. He also tries to find his way in the wild with minimal material possessions, because \\"it made the journey more enjoyable.\\" His extreme risk-taking was the hubris which eventually led to his downfall. McCandless was influenced by transcendentalism and the need to \\"revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.\\" Adaptations A film adaptation was released in September 2007, directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless. McCandless' story is also the subject of the documentary by Ron Lamothe named The Call of the Wild (2007). In his study of McCandless' death, Lamothe concludes that McCandless ran out of supplies and game, and starved to death, instead of being poisoned by eating the seeds of the wild potato. The Christopher Johnson McCandless Memorial Foundation, headed by McCandless' parents Bille and Walt, with the editorial and writing input of family and friends, released the book and DVD Back to the Wild: The Photographs & Writings of Christopher McCandless (2010). The material includes hundreds of McCandless' previously unseen pictures and journal entries. Jon Krakauer has written a piece in the book's introduction, while Hal Holbrook‚Äîwho appeared in the Penn film‚Äînarrates the DVD.  Controversy  The bus that McCandless died in remained a tourist attraction after the book became popular.

The title derived from a work that Nietzsche himself had considered writing. The work was first translated into English by Anthony M. Ludovici in 1910, and it has since seen several other translations and publications. Background After Nietzsche's breakdown in 1889, and the passing of control over his literary estate to his sister Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche, Nietzsche's friend Heinrich K√∂selitz, also known as Peter Gast, conceived the notion of publishing selections from his notebooks, using one of Nietzsche's simpler outlines as a guide to their arrangement. As he explained to Elisabeth on November 8, 1893: :Given that the original title appears as: The Antichrist. Revaluation of All Values (and therefore not 'The first book of the revaluation of all values'), you may think that your brother at the time of his incipient madness, thought the book completed. ... Notwithstanding, the consequences of this revaluation must also be explicitly illustrated in the field of morality, philosophy, politics. No one today is able to imagine such consequences ‚Äì that's why the vast preparations by your brother, the other three books of the Revaluation, must be ordered according to my suggestion and gathered in a kind of system.David Marc Hoffmann, Zur Geschichte des Nietzsche-Archives. Chronik, Studien und Dokumente, Berlin-New York, De Gruyter, 1991, p. 15. Between 1894 and 1926, Elisabeth arranged the publication of the twenty volume Gro√üoktavausgabe edition of Nietzsche's writings by C. G. Naumann. In it, following K√∂selitz's suggestion she included a selection from Nietzsche's posthumous fragments, which was gathered together and entitled The Will To Power. She claimed that this text was substantially the magnum opus, which Nietzsche had hoped to write and name \\"The Will to Power, An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values\\". The first German edition, containing 483 sections, published in 1901, was edited by K√∂selitz, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer, under Elisabeth's direction. This version was superseded in 1906 by an expanded second edition containing 1067 sections. This later compilation is what has come to be commonly known as The Will to Power. Colli and Montinari research While researching materials for the Italian translation of Nietzsche's complete works in the 1960s, the philologists Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari decided to go to the Archives in Leipzig to work with the original documents. From their work emerged the first complete and chronological edition of Nietzsche's writings, including the posthumous fragments from which F√∂rster- Nietzsche had assembled The Will To Power. The complete works comprise 5,000 pages, compared to the 3,500 pages of the Gro√üoktavausgabe. In 1964, during the International Colloquium on Nietzsche in Paris, Colli and Montinari met Karl L√∂with, who would put them in contact with Heinz Wenzel, editor for Walter de Gruyter's publishing house. Heinz Wenzel would buy the rights of the complete works of Colli and Montinari (33 volumes in German) after the French Gallimard edition and the Italian Adelphi editions. Before Colli and Montinari's philological work, the previous editions led readers to believe that Nietzsche had organized all his work toward a final structured opus called The Will to Power. In fact, if Nietzsche did consider producing such a book, he had abandoned such plans in the months before his collapse. The title of The Will to Power, which appears for the first time at the end of the summer of 1885, was replaced by another plan at the end of August 1888. This new plan was titled \\"Attempt at a revaluation of all values\\" [Versuch einer Umwerthung aller Werthe],This sub‚Äìtitle appeared on the title page of the first edition, called the Gro√üoktav. It appeared in 1901 in volume XV of Nietzsche's Werke. A transcription is displayed in Walter Kaufmann's English translation of The Will to Power, Vintage, 1968, page xxvii. and ordered the multiple fragments in a completely different way than the one chosen by Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche. Mazzino Montinari and Giorgio Colli have called The Will to Power a \\"historic forgery\\" artificially assembled by Nietzsche's sister and K√∂selitz/Gast.Giorgio Colli-Mazzino Montinari, Introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche \\"Werke. Kritische Gesamtausgabe\\" (KGA), hrsg. Colli und Montinari (edited by), Berlin und New York 1967. Although Nietzsche had in 1886 announced (at the end of On the Genealogy of Morals) a new work with the title, The Will to Power: An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values, the project under this title was set aside and some of its draft materials used to compose The Twilight of the Idols and The Antichrist (both written in 1888); the latter was for a time represented as the first part of a new four-part magnum opus, which inherited the subtitle Revaluation of All Values from the earlier project as its new title.Mazzino Montinari, Nietzsche-studien: Internationales Jahrbuch F√ºr Die Nietzsche-Forschung, 1974. Although Elisabeth F√∂rster called The Will to Power Nietzsche's unedited magnum opus, in light of Nietzsche's collapse, his intentions for the material he had not by that time put to use in The Twilight of the Idols and The Antichrist are simply unknowable. So The Will to Power was not a text completed by Nietzsche, but rather an anthology of selections from his notebooks misrepresented as if it were something more. Nevertheless, the concept remains, and has, since the reading of Karl L√∂with, been identified as a key component of Nietzsche's philosophy although many believe so erroneously, so much so that Heidegger, under L√∂with's influence, considered it to form, with the thought of the eternal recurrence, the basis of his thought. In fact, according to Montinari, not only did the Will To Power impose its own order on the fragments, but many individual fragments were themselves cut up or stitched together in ways not made clear to the reader. Gilles Deleuze himself saluted Montinari's work declaring: :As long as it was not possible for the most serious researcher to accede to the whole of Nietzsche's manuscripts, we knew only in a loose way that the Will to Power did not exist as such (...) We wish only now that the new dawn brought on by this previously unpublished work will be the sign of a return to Nietzsche.Deleuze: \\"Tant qu'il ne fut pas possible aux chercheurs les plus s√©rieux d'acc√©der √† l'ensemble des manuscrits de Nietzsche, on savait seulement de fa√ßon vague que La Volont√© de puissance n'existait pas comme telle (...) Nous souhaitons que le jour nouveau, apport√© par les in√©dits, soit celui du retour √† Nietzsche in Mazzino Montinari and Paolo D'Iorio, \\"'The Will to Power' does not exist\\" Drawing on this research for support, Montinari also called into question the very conception of a Nietzschean magnum opus, given his style of writing and thinking.Mazzino Montinari and Paolo d'Iorio, \\"'The Will to Power' does not exist\\" Mazzino Montinari, ¬´ La volont√© de puissance ¬ª n'existe pas, texte √©tabli et postfac√© par Paolo D'Iorio, traduit de l'italien par Patricia Farazzi et Michel Valensi, Paris, √âditions de l'√©clat, 1996, 192 p. Further research In 2006, Thomas H. Brobjer stated in the abstract to his study, Nietzsche's magnum opus: > Nietzsche did not write a completed magnum opus, a \\"Hauptwerk\\", but he > planned to do so during at least the last 5 years of his active life. I will > show that during and after the writing of Also sprach Zarathustra this was > his main aim and ambition. The projected work passed through a number of > related phases, of which the much discussed and controversial Will to Power > was merely one. This intention to write a magnum opus has been denied or > almost completely ignored by almost all commentators (and even the many > writers of Nietzsche biographies). I will bring attention to this intention, > discuss why it has been ignored and show that an awareness of it is > important for our understanding of the late Nietzsche's thinking and for > determining the value and originality of his late notes.

History and usage Yinz is the most recent derivation from the original Scots-Irish form you ones or \\"yous ones\\", a form of the second person plural commonly heard in parts of Ulster. When standard-English speakers talk in the first person or third person, they use different pronouns to distinguish between singular and plural. In the first person, for example, speakers use the singular I and the plural we. But when speaking in the second person, you performs double duty as both the singular form and the plural form. Crozier (1984) suggests that during the 19th century, when many Irish speakers switched to speaking English, they filled this gap with you ones, primarily because Irish has a singular second- person pronoun, t√∫, as well as a plural form, sibh. The following, therefore, is the most likely path from you ones to yinz: you ones > you'uns > youns > yunz > yinz . Because there are still speakers who use each form, there is no stable second-person plural pronoun form in southwest or central Pennsylvania, which is why the pronoun is variably referred to or spelled as you'uns, y'ins, y'uns, yunz, yuns, yinz, yenz, yins or ynz. In other parts of the U.S., Irish or Scots-Irish speakers encountered the same gap in the second-person plural. For this reason, these speakers are also responsible for coining the yunz used in and around Middletown, Pennsylvania, as well as the youse found mainly in New York City, the Philadelphia dialect and New Jersey, and the ubiquitous y'all of the South. A similar form with similar Irish/Scots roots is found further north in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. Rarely written, it is spelled yous, and is usually pronounced as or something between and . It is sometimes combined with all for emphasis, as in \\"Are yous all coming to the party?\\" This usage is also used widely within Carbon and Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. In popular culture Yinz place as one of Pittsburgh's most famous regionalisms makes it both a badge of pride and a way to show self- deprecation. For example, a group of Pittsburgh area radical cheerleaders call themselves \\"Yinz Cheer,\\" and an area literary magazine was called The New Yinzer, a take-off of The New Yorker. A DJ crew of Philadelphia-based Pittsburgh ex-pats bills itself as Philadelphyinz. Those perceived to be stereotypical blue collar Pittsburghers are often referred to as Yinzers. Yinztagram is a software program with a Pittsburgh theme. YinzCam is a Pittsburgh-based software development company. YinzFans.com is a Fan site for Pittsburgh sports fans located outside of the Pittsburgh area. At the end of every episode of \\"VH-1's Top 20 Countdown\\" host Jim Shearer always says \\"I'm Jim Shearer, and I'll see yinz later.\\" In the TV series, ‚ÄúOne Dollar‚Äù (2018) set in a rust belt town (shot in and around Pittsburgh) the Yinz address is frequently used.

On this recording, Sol Invictus wed trumpet, violin and cello to folk arrangements. Lyrically, the album focuses on the fragility of life and the certainty of death. Recording and production In the Rain was the first Sol Invictus album to fully incorporate classical instrumentation. It was the last on which the musicians David Mellor and Sarah Bradshaw participated. The frontman Tony Wakeford has described it as his most personal album. According to the book Looking for Europe: Neofolk und Hintergr√ºnde, the song \\"An English Garden\\" appears to be inspired by the film The Innocents, based on the novel The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. The album liner notes include drawings by Tor Lundvall. Reception John Bush of AllMusic described In the Rain as \\"a good collection of pop songs\\" but criticised Wakeford's vocals for being \\"occasionally erratic\\". The music scholar Isabella van Elferen analyzed the track \\"An English Garden\\" in 2013. She used its lyrics as an example of the nostalgia and sense of \\"not- belonging\\" present in goth music, and wrote that the instrumentation, song structure and chords evoke the \\"idealised British home of Goth\\", which becomes \\"musically disclosed as the locus of nothing less than the uncanny itself\\". The French music critic wrote in 2016 that the album \\"marks a true evolution in the genre\\" of neofolk, because it added cello, violin, piano and trumpet to the acoustic guitar and vocals, creating a new formula based on \\"slick production and the simple but effective beauty of the melodies\\".

Coleman ranks as one of the greatest Australian rules footballers of all time. In a relatively short playing career, Coleman has the second highest goal average in the history of the VFL/AFL, kicking 537 goals in 98 matches. He was also known for his high- flying spectacular marks, in some cases jumping cleanly over opponents. After a knee injury ended his playing career at age 25, he returned to coach Essendon to premiership success. Coleman died in 1973, at the age of 44, of sudden coronary atheroma. He is the namesake of the Coleman Medal, awarded to the AFL player who kicks the most goals during the home and away season. In 1996 he was one of 12 inaugural Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees bestowed \\"Legend\\" status. He is the only player amongst them to play less than 100 games at senior level.  Family  Born at Port Fairy in the Western District of Victoria to Albert Ernest Coleman (a manager) and his wife Ella Elizabeth (n√©e Matthews), Coleman was the youngest of four siblings; his three older siblings were Lawna Ella, Thurla Margaret and Albert Edwin.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.3. He married his Sri Lankan wife, Reine Monica Fernando, in March 1955. They had two daughters, Anne-Marie and Jennifer.Coleman, John Douglas (1928‚Äì1973) Biographical Entry ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Online  Teenage prodigy  Coleman was introduced to football at Port Fairy Higher Elementary School. During the early war years, the family moved to Melbourne, where Coleman was enrolled at Ascot Vale West State School. He later attended Moonee Ponds Central School, where he became dux of the school. At the age of 12, he already played in a local under-18 Australian rules football team. In 1943, Coleman's mother took the children to live at Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula as her husband remained in the city to look after his business. Coleman then divided his time between Melbourne, where he was a student at University High School, and Hastings, playing on Saturdays for the local football team which competed in the Mornington Peninsula League. first invited Coleman to train at the club in 1946, but considered him too young to be able to play senior football.Graeme Davison, 'Coleman, John Douglas (1928‚Äì1973)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, Melbourne University Press, 1993 In the following two seasons, Coleman completed pre-season training with Essendon and played in practice matches.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.17 However, both times he was sent back to Hastings, where he kicked 296 goals in 37 games over two years, including 23 in one game against Sorrento in August 1948.  Instant sensation  Coleman during training The 1949 season was a make-or-break time for the budding forward. He again trained with Essendon, but he was frustrated by many of the senior players who ignored his leads. Coleman's potential was noted by a number of other clubs, and Richmond made an attempt to sign him. However, Essendon finally selected him for the opening-round match against Hawthorn. From his first match, when he not only kicked a to-this-day unbeaten record of twelve goals on debut ‚Äî his 12 goals in the first home-and-away match of a season also equalled the Essendon record set by Ted Freyer, against Melbourne on 27 April 1935 ‚Äî but he also kicked a goal with his first kick,Having been paid a mark by his brother Alby's former classmate Harry Beitzel, who was the central umpire that day (Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.25). Coleman was the star player in the game, which was experiencing a boom in the immediate post-war years. Standing 185 cm tall, with a pale complexion and slight build, the 20-year-old Coleman did not appear at all imposing. He looked listless as he stood in the goal square, often a metre behind the full-back, with his long-sleeved guernsey (number 10) rolled up to his elbows. Then, with explosive speed,In his youth Coleman had been a superb athlete: :\\"John, a school prefect and vice captain of the [University High School] athletics team,went on to become a schoolboy champion at high jump, hop, step and jump, and hurdles. One old [UHS] master declared he had enough talent to go on and become an Olympic high jumper. He was also a gifted tennis player.\\" (Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.7) Coleman would slip the guard of his opponent and sprint into open space on the lead or leap onto a pack of players to take a spectacular mark. This innate ability to make position and his prodigious leap immediately caught the public imagination. He needed few opportunities to influence the outcome of a game. Later, one of his teammates, ruckman Geoff Leek, recalled one of his 1949 marks: He usually converted from most of his set shots by way of long, flat punt kicks. Notwithstanding this, however, he was also an excellent drop-kick. Ted Rippon, Coleman's former business associate and vice-president of the football club, recalled that Coleman had kicked 14 goals in a match in Perth against a WA side, and six of those goals had been drop-kicked against the wind.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.137. It is not clear from the text whether Rippon was referring to either (or both) of the two Victoria-WA matches that were played in Perth in 1951, or was referring to an inter-club pre-season match between Essendon and a team from the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). John Coleman taking a spectacular mark over North Melbourne's full-back, Vic Lawrence, on Saturday, 30 May 1953, with Essendon's Stan Booth waiting for \\"the crumbs\\".The Sporting Globe's photographer, Gerard Reilly, was at the same match; and his photograph of Coleman's mark appeared on the front page of the Saturday, 30 May 1953 Sporting Globe. In the following issue, under the title \\"Coleman Makes It Look So Easy\\", the Sporting Globe published the entire five-frame sequence of Gerard Reilly's photographs. Coleman capped his brilliant debut year in storybook fashion: he booted his one hundredth goal in the dying moments of a record Grand Final win over Carlton. He remains the only player to kick one hundred goals in his first year. The next year, 1950, was his most prolific season, with Coleman kicking 120 goals despite missing one match with the flu,Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.51. and he was a major factor in Essendon's premiership win over North Melbourne.Brittingham W, Essendon Football Club Premiership Documentary, 1949 and 1950 (Melb, 1991) (Coleman's feat of kicking more than 100 goals in consecutive seasons had only been matched by Collingwood's Gordon Coventry, South Melbourne's Bob Pratt, and Collingwood's Ron Todd, and all three of those had done it much later in their careers when they were much older, far stronger, and much more experienced.) North Melbourne back pocket Pat Kelly said he would never forget playing against Essendon in round 17 [of 1950].1950 VFL season#Round 17 The Herald's Alf Brown wrote: Essendon had beaten North Melbourne in the 1950 Second Semi-Final 11.14 (80) to 11.11 (77) when, in driving rain, and with 30 seconds remaining and with North Melbourne three points in front, North Melbourne's Jock McCorkell unexpectedly punched a ball that was already rolling out over the boundary line back into play just before it crossed the line, Coleman pounced on the ball, and passed it to Ron McEwin in the goal square. McEwin kicked the goal, and Essendon won by three points. Essendon had only lost one match during the season. In an unexpectedly one- sided Grand Final (many had thought that North Melbourne could win the rematch), with a rain-lashed third quarter, North Melbourne \\"went the knuckle\\", rather than playing football, and specifically targeted the Essendon players Dick Reynolds, Ron McEwin, Bill Snell, Bert Harper, Ted Leehane and, of course, Coleman.See Mapleston (1996), pp.162‚Äì164, and Ross (1996), p.189. Essendon won the Grand Final 13.14 (92) to North Melbourne's 7.12 (54) in front of a crowd of 87,601.1950 VFL season#Grand Final Teams Opposition coaches and full-backs stopped at nothing to curb Coleman's influence. In a one-on-one duel, close-checking, spoiling defenders fared best, but few could outrun him, and certainly no one could match him in the air. Often pitted against two, or even three, opponents, Coleman's equilibrium could be upset by needling, jostling and physical contact which often happened behind the play. Coleman's sometimes fiery temper ensured that he never backed away from a confrontation. Harry Caspar: \\"the man who cost Essendon the flag\\" 1951 finals series. Despite specific instructions having been given to the umpires in relation to the protection of forwards from \\"interference\\" from opposing backmen,\\"League defenders who \\"interfere\\" with forwards by holding on to their guernseys while play is at another part of the ground will be penalised in future matches. The League permit and umpire committee has instructed umpires and the umpires' coach to pay attention to the practice of interfering with forwards in future games. Mr. W. Brew (Essendon) told delegates at the V.F.L. permit meeting on Wednesday night that in recent matches leading forwards had been \\"held down\\" by their guernseys by full backs without justification, and often when play was at the other end of the ground. Mr. H. Clover (Carlton), a former champion forward: \\"That's-not a new trick. It happened to me 25 years ago!\\" \\": Forwards to be Protected, The Argus, (Friday, 12 May 1950), p.19 and in the absence of any sort of protection at all from the field umpires,At the time, there were no rules allowing for additional penalties (e.g., the current 50-metre penalty in AFL), and there would not be until the VFL introduced the \\"15-yard penalty\\" at the start of the 1955 season (Ross, 1996, p.201). these problems with Coleman's response to the ever-increasing level of provocation, abuse, headlocks, hair-tugging,For example: Saturday's Rough Football, The Argus, (Monday, 20 August 1951), p.1; and The Coleman Incident, The Age, (Monday, 20 August 1951), p.14. and thuggery came to head quite sensationally when Coleman was reported in the last minutes of the second quarter of Essendon's last match of the 1951 home- and-away season against Carlton, at Princes Park. He was reported for striking Carlton's journeyman back-pocket ruckman Harry Caspar; Caspar was also reported for striking Coleman.\\"Angry Crowd at Carlton; Bottle Misses Coleman\\", The Age, (Monday, 3 September 1951), p.14For extensive details of the whole matter see Maplestone, 1996, p.166; Ross, 1996, p.192; and Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, pp.52‚Äì65. Today, it is well established that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was at the other end of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way.Ross (1996, p.263) The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match, bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field. He was finally persuaded to take the field for the second half, and once on the field, he was so \\"full of fire\\" that, according to the recollection of ruckman Geoff Leek, at the time the resting in the forward-pocket, he took two of the most amazing marks that Leek had ever seen: At the tribunal, Caspar's case was heard first.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.94 Caspar was suspended for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought to have made a good case for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he were a man at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, pp.57‚Äì58.Jack Cannon's, The Argus, Wednesday, 5 September 1951 () Given that those who retaliated were thought to have been given more lenient penalties than those who instigated, and given that ‚Äî because Carlton were not in the finals ‚Äî Caspar's penalty represented the first four home-and-home games in 1952, and given that Essendon were, indeed, playing in the 1951 finals, it was generally thought by those present at the tribunal that, if Coleman was to receive any penalty at all, he would be given no more than two weeks. The chairman announced a penalty of four weeks. Many years later, the tribunal's chairman, Tom Hammond, agreed that whilst the tribunal had been technically correct in its penalty, given that \\"there was no precedent\\" for regarding retaliation as a lesser offence, that he now believed that the tribunal had been wrong and that it easily could have created such a precedent. Coleman broke down and wept with anger, disbelief and disappointment. As his friends and colleagues tried to assist Coleman from the tribunal's building, the impact of the rush of the large waiting crowd hurled Coleman against a traffic signal-box. He struck his head and collapsed on the pavement. He was eventually assisted into one of his friend's cars.\\"Coleman ‚Äî Caspar ‚Äî and the Crowd\\", The Argus, (Wednesday, 5 Sept 1951), p.3.\\"Coleman Suspended by Tribunal: Will Miss Final\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 5 Sept 1951), p.22Cannon, J., \\"Tribunal Verdict Shocks\\", The Argus, (Wednesday, 5 Sept 1951), p.11 Eventually, the Bombers went on, without Coleman and with Dick Reynolds coming out of retirement as 20th man, to lose the Grand Final by eleven points, and Essendon supporters to this day blame Coleman's suspension for Essendon's failure to win its third successive premiership.  Goalless Coleman  On Saturday, 28 June 1952, in round ten of the 1952 season, at a very, very muddy (and narrow) Brunswick Street Oval,The Brunswick Street Oval was in such poor condition that Fitzroy named a squad of 23 players for the match and would not name the final 20 players until just before the match, on the Saturday afternoon, when the actual condition of the ground and the weather could be far more accurately appraised (Beames, P., \\"Tigers Wait on Weather to Decide Team\\", The Age, Friday, (27 June 1952), p.16). Coleman played opposite the champion Fitzroy fullback, Vic Chanter. In a tough, rugged match, Fitzroy 13.12 (90) beat Essendon 5.8 (38). Coleman, who would finish the 1952 season with 103 goals, did not score a goal in the match; and this was the first (and the only) time that Coleman was held goalless in his entire 98-game career. He had less than half a dozen kicks for the entire match‚Äîdespite being moved to center half-forward for a while during the second quarter‚Äîand was only able to score two behinds, one of which was effected with the last scoring kick of the match.The Argus newspaper spoke of him being \\"starved\\" by Chanter, and reported that \\"star Essendon forward John Coleman became a mere figurehead\\" (Dunn, J., \\"Tough Fitzroy Far Too Good\\", The Argus, (Monday, 30 June 1952), p.9)  Coleman's injury  After six successive years in the finals, Essendon dropped down the ladder as an era ended. Coleman continued to be the best forward in the game, winning the VFL goal-kicking by scoring 103 goals in 1952 and 97 in 1953. In the seventh game of the 1954 season he kicked his best ever tally of 14 goals against Fitzroy. But at Windy Hill a week later, Coleman fell heavily and dislocated his knee in what proved to be his last game. His attempts to return drew many headlines over the next two years but, despite surgery, he was forced to concede defeat in the lead up to the 1956 season.Whitington (1976). Also, for an extensive coverage of the matter of the injury and its treatment, see Ackerly (11 May 2007) There were revelations in early 1958 that Coleman's knee was sufficiently repaired to play on and his true reasons for not playing were unrelated to his knee. Coleman kicked 537 goals in just 98 appearances, at an average of 5.48 goals per game. At the time of his retirement, it was the highest goals-per-game average by any player, exceeding the next-best total of Bob Pratt (4.31 goals per game) by more than a goal. Coleman's feats were even more impressive by virtue of the fact that he achieved them at a time when the rules of the game were less favourable to full-forwards: between 1925‚Äì1939, a free kick was always awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which resulted in teams of the era adopting a direct game-plan which favoured strong full-forwards, and it was an era which produced many of the league's heaviest goalscorers, including Pratt, Gordon Coventry, Bill Mohr and Ron Todd; but Coleman played after the boundary throw-in had been re- introduced, resulting in more play along the wings and less prominence from full-forwards.Ross, (1996), p.114.Mapleston (1996), p.175. As of 2014, Coleman's VFL/AFL record has been surpassed by only Peter Hudson (5.64 goals per game).  Coleman the businessman  Coleman was a capable businessman who understood the commercial potential of his fame. Football had interrupted his commerce studies at Melbourne University in 1949, but the game helped him to launch a career managing pubs. Essendon vice president Ted Rippon, also an Essendon footballer before the Second World War, made him the manager of the Auburn Hotel, and their association continued when Coleman became licensee of the Essendon Hotel. Subsequently, he went into business on his own, running the West Brunswick Hotel. He also developed media interests, writing for the Herald newspaper from 1954 and appearing as a commentator on television after its introduction in 1956.Maplestone M, Those Magnificent Men, 1897‚Äì1987 (Melb, 1988) Coleman the coach Coleman's business and family life took an unexpected turn in 1961, when Essendon ‚Äì who, in recent times, were being increasingly referred to as \\"the Gliders\\", rather than \\"the Bombers\\", because of their poor performances at the business end of the season ‚Äì considered replacing Dick Reynolds as coach (he had been at Essendon for 27 years, 21 as coach), and declared the coaching position open.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, pp.101‚Äì102; Mapleston (1996), pp. 191‚Äì192, and Ross (1996), p.217. Essendon received three applications for the coaching position: 1960 coach Dick Reynolds, 1960 team captain Jack Clarke, and John Coleman (then 32 and out of football for 6 years), who had been persuaded to apply despite having no coaching experience. Coleman was not the committee's unanimous choice, with both Reynolds and Clarke receiving some support, but he received almost a two to one majority of the final vote. Coleman was appointed coach on a day of mixed emotion; his father had died the day before. Coleman's brief was to inject more vigor into the side and get them to play as Coleman had done. He proved to be a clever tactician, eschewing the histrionics of a \\"hot- gospelling\\" style, instead concentrating his efforts on quietly harnessing the individual talents of his players, expressing the view that team spirit was, to him, just as important as physical fitness for eventual team success.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah, 1997, p.102. Coleman was unable to supervise his first training session until 6 April 1961 (the first home-and- away match was 15 April 1961), because he had come down with hepatitis on his return to Australia, following a two-month holiday with Monica in India and Sri Lanka. After a disappointing first season when the team seemed to have trouble adjusting to his style (having had 22 years of Reynolds' approach, that is not astonishing), Coleman surprised many by leading the Bombers to the premiership in 1962. The team performed brilliantly, losing only two games for the season and crushing Carlton in the Grand Final. During his playing days Coleman had developed a special loathing for umpiresIt was said that this hatred was so intense that he would not speak with anyone wearing a white shirt (the standard umpire's uniform of those times). and they were often the target of his venomous tongue as a coach. Essendon suffered a premiership hangover and finished fifth in the 1963. They were subsequently eliminated in the first semi-final of the 1964. Another flag followed in the 1965, when Essendon achieved the rare feat of winning from fourth place.1965 VFL season With two premierships in the bag as a coach, Coleman could rest assured that his reputation was secure. By now, his health had begun to cause him some concern. The knee injury prevented him from actively participating in training and he suffered badly from thrombosis. He reluctantly agreed to return for the 1967 season. The Bombers missed the finals, and Coleman then handed the coaching job over to Jack Clarke.  Sudden death  Coleman moved to the Mornington Peninsula, buying a rural property at Arthurs Seat and running the Dromana Hotel. In the early hours of 5 April 1973, he died suddenly of coronary atheroma. The public was stunned and saddened. On Saturday 7 April 1973, the opening round of the VFL season included a match held at Windy Hill between Essendon and Richmond, which became in effect a John Coleman memorial. Richmond defeated Essendon by 2 points that day, with the decisive last goal of the game kicked by Richmond's Kevin Sheedy, who would go on to be Essendon's next premiership-winning coach (1984) after Coleman.1973 VFL season#Round 1 After a large funeral conducted at St Thomas' Church of England, in Mount Alexander Road, Moonee Ponds (the church in which he had married), by Archdeacon Randal Hugh Deasey (1916‚Äì?) on Monday 9 April 1973, attended by many of Melbourne's sporting community, Coleman was cremated. 400 people packed into the church, and another 600 stood outside the church listening to the service broadcast over loudspeakers.A photograph taken outside the church appears at Ross (1996), p.263. The pallbearers included his brother Albert, his former business associate Ted Rippon, and the former Essendon full-forward Ted Fordham. The mourners included Sir Maurice Nathan and Ralph Lane from the VFL, and Essendon footballers John Birt, Russell Blew, Jack Clarke, Ken Fraser, Geoff Leek, Greg Sewell, David Shaw, John Somerville, and John Williams.Miller, Petraitis & Jeremiah (1997), p.132.

Rage City Rollergirls jammer \\"Spenard Itch\\" poses underneath the bridge which carries Spenard Road over Fish Creek. Spenard is a neighborhood in the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska, United States and was historically a separate city from Anchorage. Spenard maintains the flavor of a separate community today, with \\"Spenardi Gras\\" being its primary community celebration that encourages a sense of solidarity and separation from the rest of Anchorage. Spenard is a central focus of bohemian lifestyle practitioners and artists and writers, and is well known for its numerous poetry jams, bicycle parties, and other similar events. The road that bears its name, Spenard Road, begins at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport at its southern end, and continues north toward downtown before ending at Westchester Lagoon, where it turns and becomes part of I Street. History Before unification of the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975, Spenard was a city in its own right. It is arguably older than Anchorage itself, although records are not clear. Anchorage was founded on Ship Creek during construction of the Alaska Railroad. Spenard began as a lumber camp. The road from the lumber camp to the tent city on Ship Creek was subsequently named \\"Spenard Road\\" for Joe Spenard, an owner of the lumber camp. Joe Spenard built a dance hall/resort on the shores of Spenard Lake, which burned down after a brief period of great success. For years, Spenard contained one of many \\"red light districts\\" in the region (other red light districts were found in downtown Anchorage on Fourth Avenue, in Fairview, and in the nearby town of Mountain View). During construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the City of Anchorage successfully cleaned up Fourth Avenue by literally bulldozing dozens of buildings. However, the proximity of Spenard to Anchorage International Airport resulted in unprecedented growth of bars, nightclubs, prostitution outlets, gambling clubs, and other disreputable businesses, which catered to pipeline workers laden with money after long stints in isolated construction camps. Today, Spenard still features a large number of bars and a somewhat higher rate of drunken crime than the rest of Anchorage, despite extensive efforts during the post-Pipeline era to \\"clean up\\" the community. Transportation There is much redevelopment (in the form of mixed-use, transit-oriented development) planned for the Spenard Road corridor, especially in the vicinity of 36th Avenue & Spenard Road. https://www.muni.org/Departments/OCPD/Planning/Projects/Pages/SpenardCorridorStrategicPlan.aspxhttps://www.adn.com/alaska- news/anchorage/2016/07/17/rundown-stretch-of-spenard-road-in-anchorage-headed- for-major-facelift/http://www.alaskajournal.com/2017-06-07/housing-both- affordable-and-trendy-snapped-anchorage#.WkrUTd-nHIU http://www.spenardcorridorplan.com/history/ In order to support this development, the neighborhood was placed on the People Mover's \\"frequent network\\", with the #40 bus operating every 15 minutes down Spenard Road on weekdays (weekend service operates every 30 minutes). There is also the #65 (once per hour), which takes neighborhood residents to/from the Dimond Center Mall via Jewel Lake Road.

Derived from the word polis (\\"city- state\\"), it has a range of meanings, from \\"the rights of citizens\\" to a \\"form of government\\". English translations of the Greek word According to Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon a meaning of politeia is \\"the conditions and rights of the citizen, or citizenship\\", analogous to the Latin civitas.. Politeia, in Greek means the community of citizens in a city / state. It should not be confused with \\"regime\\" that is meant by politeuma. or \\"Status quo\\" that is meant by kathestos.. Politeuma is the word describing the political situation of the community of citizens in a city/state, and kathestos means also the general situation of an object, an agreement, or something else. Politeia is derived from both the root word polis meaning \\"city\\" or \\"state\\", and from the verb politeuomai that means \\"I am living as an active citizen of the polis.\\" People living in a Greek city/state were not necessarily citizens. A person that was ostracized from the active matrix of the city was an example of such. Another example was people who lived in the city but were not active citizens who had a say in the political processes of the community. Women, slaves and others who Greek men deemed unworthy were not in the active matrix of the political formations of that city state, making them not-citizens, so not part of politeia. In the works of ancient Greek philosophers, the principal meaning of politeia appears to be: \\"how a polis is run; constitution\\". A politeia differs from modern written constitutions in two respects: first, not all Greek states put their laws in writing; more importantly, the Greeks did not normally distinguish between ordinary and constitutional legislation. If a certain body had the power to change the laws, it had the power to change the laws controlling its own power and membership ‚Äì even to abolish itself and set up a new governing body. The phrases system of government, state organisation, form of government, and, more recently, r√©gime have also been used to translate politeia. R√©gime has drawbacks: it is ambiguous where politeia is not, since a change of r√©gime can mean a change of governors under the same form of government. It has a negative tone in English, which politeia does not in Greek. It is also a loan- word; and in that regard, has no advantage over simply adopting politeia itself. Some translators thus use a different term for this second meaning of politeia. Most common is the vague term polity. Specific translations of this second meaning as constitutional democracy or republic are at least anachronistic, and in most instances contentious and/or inaccurate. Some translators feel it is incorrect to translate the same word in different ways, arguing that the ambiguity must have been deliberate and that it is impossible to always know which way the word should be rendered. In the Greek New Testament politeia is translated as \\"commonwealth\\" or \\"freedom\\" in Ephesians 2:12 and Acts 22:28. Politeia in the work of the authors of Antiquity Plato and Cicero Politeia is the original title of the book by Plato now commonly known in English as The Republic. Cicero translated politeia as res publica (see also: De re publica), from which the modern word republic comes. Note that the meanings the ancient Romans attached to res publica were also multiple and only partially overlapping with the Greek politeia, and further that few of the multiple meanings of politeia or res publica are much of an equivalent to republic as it is understood in modern political science. Aristotle In the Constitution of the Athenians (Athenaion Politeia), Aristotle uses politeia for eleven states of the Athenian government up to his own time, from the absolute monarchy of Ionia and the tyranny of the Thirty to the democratic Assembly and selection by lot of Pericles's time and his own. He may have added that the absolute monarchy of Ion was \\"less political\\"According to the Loeb translation. than that of Theseus or the later constitutions, but the text is doubtful. In his Politics, Aristotle clearly uses politeia both as above and also in a more restricted sense. Exactly what this sense is, and whether Aristotle is using it in a consistent manner, have both been long debated. By careful choice of quotation, all of the following can be defended: *A specific form of government. Aristotle classified constitutions on two grounds: how many citizens had a voice in making the laws; and whether they did so considering the good of all citizens, or only their own. Along with monarchy and aristocracy politeia is one of the three virtuous forms of government. While monarchy is the rule by one, and aristocracy by the few, politeia is rule by the many. *A constitution that does not fit into this sixfold classification, because it has features of more than one of them: the constitutions of Carthage, Sparta, and [at least one of the cities of] Crete. *A constitution which mixes oligarchy and democracy (terms which, as used by Aristotle, refer to vicious kinds of constitutions). *A constitution in which the hoplites governed. This is more restrictive than the Athens of Aristotle's time. Athens was a naval power, and many citizens were allowed to vote, and served the state well in war, who could not afford massive metal armor. In Book III of his Politics (1279a), Aristotle seems to indicate that, in principle, politeia refers generically to any form of government or constitution, although he uses the word also to call a particular form of government: \\"When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (politeion), government (politeia).\\" Why Aristotle uses the same term to refer to at least two distinct ideas has confused readers for millennia. For instance, later Aristotle refers to the ideal politeia as one using a mixed government. But it is uncertain whether he is referring to governments in general or to a specific form. In the New Testament politeia refers both the Greek World as well as to the nation of Israel. Strong's Concordance defines the term as: Signifies (a) \\"the relation in which a citizen stands to the state, the condition of a citizen, citizenship,\\" Acts 22:28, \\"with a great sum obtained I this citizenship\\" (KJV, \\"freedom\\"). While Paul's \\"citizenship\\" of Tarsus was not of advantagre outside that city, yet his Roman \\"citizenship\\" availed throughout the Roman Empire and, besides private rights, included (1) exemption from all degrading punishments; (2) a right of appeal to the emperor after a sentence; (3) a right to be sent to Rome for trial before the emperor if charged with a capital offense. Paul's father might have obtained \\"citizenship\\" (1) by manumission; (2) as a reward of merit; (3) by purchase; the contrast implied in Acts 22:28 is perhaps against the last mentioned; (b) \\"a civil polity, the condition of a state, a commonwealth,\\" said of Israel, Ephesians 2:12.

Early life Born in King's Lynn, Norfolk,Alistair McGown Carpenter, Richard (1929‚Äì2012), BFI screenonline page Carpenter attended the Old Vic Theatre School before starting an acting career by working in repertory theatre. Career Carpenter appeared in occasional films, but was mostly active on British TV in the 1960s as a character actor, on one occasion opposite Tony Hancock in one of his last shows for the BBC, commonly known as \\"The Bowmans\\". Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included Z-Cars, Dixon of Dock Green, Gideon's Way, Sherlock Holmes and The Baron. In 1969, Carpenter created Catweazle, the children's series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers' Guild award for creating the cult children's TV series. During the 1970s, he wrote the series The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976‚Äì1978), Dick Turpin (1979‚Äì1982), parts of the series The Famous Five and Doctor Snuggles, and 17 episodes of The Adventures of Black Beauty for ITV; and Cloud Burst, The Boy from Space and The King's Dragon as part of BBC's Look and Read (1967‚Äì2004) programme for schools, some episodes of which he also presented. In the 1980s came the historical adventures Smuggler and its later antipodean- based follow-up Adventurer and between them, the lavish HTV production Robin of Sherwood, which ran for three series. As Anthony Hayward wrote in this cited obituary: Carpenter re-imagined the Robin Hood legend in Robin of Sherwood (1984‚Äì86). Mysticism was one of its distinctive ingredients, reflecting a renewed interest in paganism, as well as the concerns of the growing environmental movement and ‚Äì through the idealism of the hero Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s (The Winjin' Pom, Stanley's Dragon and Out of Sight), some of which (The Borrowers, The Return of the Borrowers and The Scarlet Pimpernel) were based on classic novels. Carpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created: Catweazle, Cloud Burst, The Ghosts of Motley Hall, Smuggler, Robin of Sherwood (two books) and two books of Dick Turpin. Personal life Carpenter married Annabelle Lee in 1954. They lived in Ayot Bury, Ayot St Peter near Welwyn in Hertfordshire, had two children and remained married until his death. Death On 26 February 2012, at the age of 82, Carpenter died in Hertfordshire from a pulmonary embolism.Abbie Bernstein \\"In Memoriam: ROBIN OF SHERWOOD creator Richard Carpenter passes at age 78\\", AssignmentX, 27 February 2012Alex Farber \\"Catweazle creator Richard Carpenter dies\\", Broadcast, 29 February 2012 Filmography *Tarnished Heroes (1961) - Freddy *H.M.S.

To raise a wind, a human blood sacrifice was needed, and the lots fell on King V√≠kar himself. Starkad (Starka√∞r), V√≠kar's counselor urged a mock hanging from a tree instead, but in giving this advice Starkad had been prompted by the god Odin, who desired V√≠kar's death. According to the account in Gautreks saga, when Starkad let loose the branch, the apparent reed-stalk with which Starkad stabbed at the king was seen to be a real spear, the stump under V√≠kar's feet fell away, and the calf guts which had been used instead of rope turned into a strong withy. V√≠kar died. Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum (book 6) refers to a similar version relating a magic transformation, but prefers or invents a more rational account in which Starkad tied the osier very tightly so that V√≠kar could hardly breathe and then stabbed V√≠kar with his sword. This was the first of Starkad's three great crimes. From Gesta Danorum Saxo's account is short, seemingly a summary. He claims that Odin had given Starkad three times the span of a mortal life in order to commit a proportionate number of crimes. But this follows on a discussion about Odin and Thor which interrupts his story and seems out of place. The discussion may have been inspired by a fuller account such as the version in Gautrek's saga where Starkad's fate is decided by an interchange of blessings and curses laid on Starkad by Odin and Thor alternately. For Saxo, Vikar (Wicarus) is simply \\"king of Norway\\" rather than of king of H√∂rdaland (modern Hordaland) or some other region within Norway. After Starkad's destiny was laid on him, Starkad came to Vikar (perhaps for the first time) for the purpose of accomplishing Vikar's death. Starkad lodged with King V√≠kar, and so was present on the raiding expedition where Vikar was becalmed for the greater part of a year. From Gautreks saga According to Gautreks saga, V√≠kar was the son of a king of Agdir (Ag√∞ir) named Harald Agder-king (Haraldr inn eg√∞ski) whose ancestry is not given. After the death of Starkad's father St√≥virk (St√≥rvirkr), young Starkad was brought up in Harald's court along with Harald's son V√≠kar. King Herthj√≥f (Her√æj√≥fr) of H√∂rdaland made a surprise attack one night, slew Harald Agder- king and took his son V√≠kar hostage to ensure the behavior of Harald's former subjects. This Herthj√≥f was son of King Hunthj√≥f (Hun√æj√≥fr) son of Fridthj√≥f the Bold (Fri√∞√æj√≥fr inn fr√¶kna), the protagonist of Fridthj√≥fs saga ins fr√¶kna. But after some years V√≠kar gathered some champions to himself, including the young Starkad, made a surprise attack on Herthj√≥f's hall, and slew King Herthj√≥f and thirty of his men. V√≠kar then became king of Agdir, Jadar (Ja√∞ar, modern Jaederen in H√∂rdaland), and Hardang (Har√∞angr, modern Hardanger) which Herthj√≥f had also ruled. The tale then tells of V√≠kar's successful battle at Lake V√¶nir (Lake V√§nern) against King S√≠sar (S√≠sarr) of Kiev, of V√≠kar's defeat of Herthj√≥f's brother King Geirthj√≥f (Geir√æj√≥fr) of the Uplands in a war in which Geirthj√≥f fell in the First battel of Telemark, and how V√≠kar then took over not only the Uplands but also Telemark which belonged to Geirthj√≥f's brother Fridthj√≥f who was not there at the time. When Fridthj√≥f returned and attacked, V√≠kar defeated him with the aid of King √ìl√°f the Keen-eyed (√ìl√°fr inn skyggni), king of N√¶rr√≠ki in Sweden (modern N√§rke). Fridthj√≥f agreed to a treaty by which his kingdom was turned over to V√≠kar but Fridthj√≥f kept his life and freedom. At the Second battel of Telemark In all these battles Starkad was V√≠kar's greatest warrior. After all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to H√∂rdaland with a large army, V√≠kar was becalmed. Divination showed Odin required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and V√≠kar's lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair (Hrossh√°rs-Grani), Starkad's foster father, took Stakad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be Odin. After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King V√≠kar in payment for Odin's blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death. From H√°lfs saga H√°lfs saga og h√°lfsrekka provides a different King. Here V√≠kar is the son of King Alrek (Alrekr) of H√∂rdaland with no mention of King Harald of Agdir or King Herthj√≥f of H√∂rdaland. Alrek's ancestry is not given in the saga, but according to the √Üttartolur (genealogies' attached to Hversu Noregr byggdist), Alrek was the son of Eir√≠k the Eloquent (Eir√≠kr inn m√°lspaki), son of Alrek, son of Eir√≠k, son of Skj√∂ld (Sk«´ldr) son of Skelfir, king of V√∂rs (V«´rs), modern Voss in northern Hordaland. Skelfir was the ancestor of the Skilfings. See Scylfing for further details and comment. Alrek dwelt at Alreksstead (Alrekssta√∞r, modern Alrekstad), presumably named after himself. Alrek had married Sign√Ω, daughter of an unnamed king of V√∂rs, but was urged by Koll (Kollr), one of his men, to also look at Geirhild (Geirhildr) daughter of Dr√≠f (Dr√≠fr). Meanwhile, Odin came to Geirhild in the guise of a man named H√∂tt (H«´ttr 'hood') and bargained with Geirhild that he would make her into Alrek's wife if Geirhild agreed to call on H√∂tt in all things. Geirhild accepted. When Alrek saw Geirhild, he took her as his second wife. But Sign√Ω and Geirhild quarreled to the point that Alrek decided to give up one of them and announced he would keep whoever had brewed the best beer when he returned from his raiding. Sign√Ω called on Freyja but Geirhild prayed to H√∂tt, who appeared before her, spat into the beer, but said he would be back to take what was between herself and the beer vat in exchange, meaning the child of Alrek in Geirhild's womb. When Alrek returned he judged Geirhild's beer the best and so kept her as his wife, but said he that foresaw her son on a gallows, sacrificed to Odin. The account then tells how Alrek was slain by King J√∂sur (J«´surr) of Rogaland in a war Alrek made against Koll of Kollsey. Alrek had died and J√∂sur had already departed before Alrek's son V√≠kar arrived at the battlefield. But years later, when J√∂sur was again in Kollsey, King V√≠kar attacked J√∂sur and slew him along with all the farmers in the area, leaving only the women, whence the area was purportedly afterwards known as Kvennaherad (Kvennahera√∞ 'Women's hundred'). War continued between King V√≠kar and King J√∂sur's son Hj√∂r (Hj«´rr) until at last they agreed to make peace. Since Hj√∂r and his descendants are afterwards called kings of H√∂rdaland. At that point V√≠kar is out of the story which does not relate his death, being concerned instead with Hj√∂r, his son Hj√∂rleif (Hj«´leifr), and then Hj√∂rleif's son H√°lf (H√°lfr) who is the central figure in the saga. Descendants of V√≠kar From Gautreks saga According to Gautreks saga V√≠kar had two sons named Harald and Neri. During his life, V√≠kar made Harald the King of Telemark and Neri Jarl of the Uplands. Upon V√≠kar's death, the brothers came to an agreement by which Harald became King of Agdir and H√∂rdaland and Neri became Jarl of Telemark and the Uplands. From H√°lf's saga and the √Üttartolur According to H√°lf's saga and the √Üttartolur, V√≠kar had a son named Vatnar whom H√°lfs saga says was buried in Vatnar's Howe (Vatnarshaugr). Vatnar fathered two sons. Half's saga names Vartnar's sons as Snjall (Snjallr) and Hjall (Hjallr) whose bodies lay in the Brothers' Howe (Br√¶√∞rahaugr). In the √Üttartolur the two sons are instead named √çmald (√çmaldr) and Eir√≠k, Eir√≠k being the father of Gyda (Gy√∞a) who married Harald Fairhair. This is the King Eir√≠k of H√∂rdaland who appears in the Saga of Harald Fairhair in the Heimskringla. Commentary There are resemblances between the variant back stories of V√≠kar found in Gautreks saga and H√°lfs saga. In both Vikar's father is slain in battle by another king and in both V√≠kar in turn attacked and slew that king some years later. An heir to that king then made war on V√≠kar, either a younger brother or a son. This war ends with a peace agreement. That V√≠kar's opponents and father and descendants are differently named may in part come from varying ideas of when V√≠kar lived. The accounts provide three contradictory synchronisms with the dynasty of Yngling kings in the Ynglinga saga. Gautreks saga, in the material about Starkad, relates that after V√≠kar's sacrificial death, which was Starkad's first crime, Starkad took refuge in Sweden with the kings Alrek and Eir√≠k. In the Ynglinga saga Starkad is mentioned in a single reference to Starkad's third crime, the slaying of √Åli the Bold (√Åli inn fr√¶kni). √Åli had usurped the Swedish throne from King Aun the Old, the great-grandson of King Alrek to whom Starkad fled. This is a good chronological match considering Starkad's supposed lifespan of 300 years and that Aun was 60 years old when √Åli usurped his throne. This tradition places Vikar and Starkad far back in the mists of times. But in H√°lfs saga, King Hj√∂r who warred against V√≠kar is father of King Hj√∂rleif, father of H√°lf, father of Hj√∂r, father of Geirmund Hellskin (Geirmundr heljarskinn) a contemporary of King Harald Fairhair who settled in Iceland, indicating roughly four generations from Vikar's time to Harald Fairhair's time. In the √Üttartolur, V√≠kar is father of Vatnar, father of Eir√≠k, father of Gyda, wife of Harald Fairhair, indicating three generations from V√≠kar's time to Harald Fairhair's time. Generations are not exact chronological measurements, so a difference between four generations and three generations does not break the relative chronology. (See Gard Agdi for the √Üttartolur traditions about Geirmund's ancestors.) In both accounts V√≠kar is king of H√∂rdaland, though Gautreks saga connects V√≠kar primarily with Agdir. In the Saga of Harald Fairhair and elsewhere, King Eir√≠k, V√≠kar's grandson in the √Üttartolur, rules H√∂rdaland. But other accounts appear to contradict this. The beginning of Grettis saga ('Saga of Grettir') states that H√∂rdaland was ruled by Geirmund Hellskin. The Landn√°mab√≥k (2.19) instead tells that Geirmund had a dominion in Rogaland but also agrees with the later H√°lfs saga that Geirmund was son of Hj√∂r, son of H√°lf, son of Hj√∂rleif who was king of the Hj√∂rdalanders. H√°lfs saga suggests an explanation. This saga first says that Alrek and his son V√≠kar ruled H√∂rdaland but Hj√∂rleif's ancestors were kings of Rogaland. But after the peace agreement between V√≠kar and Hj√∂r (and presumably after V√≠kar's death), Hj√∂rleif son of Hj√∂r is called king of both H√∂rdaland and Rogaland. The situation these account envisages appears to be the reign of two simultaneous lines of kings within H√∂rdaland, perhaps historically true or perhaps arising from artificial conflation of different traditions--traditions perhaps of rulers who reigned over H√∂rdaland at different times, if they ever reigned at all. Such a conflation would encourage the roles played by Geirthj√≥f and Fridthj√≥f to be assigned to J√∂sur and Hj√∂r who in this chronology would become V√≠kar's contemporaries. The third chronological placement of V√≠kar and Starkad is intermediate between these two. The final parts of Gautreks saga make Neri son of V√≠kar a contemporary of Hr√≥lf Kraki of Denmark. Hr√≥lf Kraki of Denmark is noted for his interactions with King Adils (A√∞ils) of Sweden who in the Ynglinga saga is sixth in descent from King Alrek of Sweden, the contemporary of V√≠kar in the Starkad section of Gautreks saga. The Gautreks saga therefore contains two contradictory synchronisms with the Yngling lineage. But about that time of Adils, reckoning by generations, is when the Ynglinga saga places King Gautrek. Some of the details in H√°lfs saga also indicate this third synchronism. King Hj√∂r who warred against V√≠kar is father of King Hj√∂rleif, one of whose wives was the sister of S√∂lvi (S«´lvi) the Viking who usurped the Swedish throne from King Eystein (Eysteinn) who was purportedly Adils' son and seventh in descent from King Alrek. The Old English poem Beowulf may agree with this intermediate synchronism. In that poem, the first section occurs during the reign of King Hrothgar of Denmark, the uncle of Hr√≥lf Kraki (called Hrothwulf in the poem). Beowulf foresees that Ingeld's planned wedding to King Hrothgar's daughter will be thwarted by an old warrior who will bring up details of past quarrels and wrongs between the Danes and Heathobards and fighting will result. In the account in book 6 of the Gesta Danorum's, in a parallel story about Ingeldus, the part assigned in prophecy to the unnamed warrior is played by Starkad.

Toponymy  Ixtlahuac√°n is a word of Nahuatl origin, it is the union of the words \\"Ixtl√°huatl\\" (plains) and \\"Can\\" (place); therefore, it means: \\"Place of Plains\\" .toponimos / i / ixtlahuacandelrio.html Toponimos  History  It was founded by Toltecs at the beginning of 7th century when they passed through the region. Possibly he was first in Tlacot√°n where tribes settled totonacas, tepehuanes and coanes, the founders being the tepehuanes, who stood out for their belligerence. The conquerors that approached Tlacot√°n were continually harassed by the aborigines of Ixtlahuac√°n. The conquest was carried out by Nu√±o de Guzm√°n who arrived in Tlacot√°n in 1529. It seemed a strategic place to defend and dominate the entire Atemajac Valley. Fines of 1531 gave the name of Nueva Galicia to everything conquered by Nu√±o de Guzm√°n, who was appointed governor, founding Guadalajara in Nochistl√°n; after not having followed, ordering his transfer to Tlacot√°n in May 1533, giving him the name of Guadalajara; the foundation was not carried out until 1535 and in 1539 royal ID was received granting the coat of arms to the town (Tlacot√°n), being seat of Guadalajara from 1535 to 1540. In 1825 it had a town hall and from that date until 1910 it belonged to the 1st canton of Guadalajara; in 1838, it had a category of town and in 1878 it is already mentioned as a municipality. They had the police stations of Tepac, Tlacot√°n and the Congregation of San Antonio.

A symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels. It is a member of the international consortium, The Leading Hotels of the World. Over the course of its history the Ritz has become so associated with luxury and elegance that the word \\"ritzy\\" has entered the English language to denote something that is ostentatiously stylish, fancy, or fashionable.\\"Ritzy\\" meaning in the Cambridge English DictionaryDefinition of \\"ritzy\\" by Merriam-Webster\\"Ritzy\\" at WiktionaryDefinition of \\"ritzy\\" by Oxford Dictionaries The hotel was opened by Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz in May 1906, eight years after he established the H√¥tel Ritz Paris. After a weak beginning, the hotel began to gain popularity towards the end of World War I, and became popular with politicians, socialites, writers and actors of the day in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. No√´l Coward was a notable diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s. Owned by the Bracewell-Smith family for a period until 1976, The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for ¬£80 million from Trafalgar House in October 1995. They spent eight years and ¬£40 million restoring it to its former grandeur. In 2002, it became the first hotel to receive a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales for its banquet and catering services. The exterior is both structurally and visually Franco-American in style with little trace of English architecture, and is heavily influenced by the architectural traditions of Paris. The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly , on the Arlington Street side, and on the Green Park side. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. The Ritz has 111 rooms and 25 suites. The Ritz Club, owned by the owners of the Ritz Hotel since 1998, is a casino in the basement of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill. It offers roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines. The interior was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, which is consistent throughout. Author Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as \\"one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture\\" and compares it to a royal palace with its \\"grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers\\". The Ritz's most widely known facility is the Palm Court, which hosts the famous \\"Tea at the Ritz\\". It is an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting, with panelled mirrors in gilt bronze frames. The hotel has six private dining rooms, the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its boiserie, and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to resemble the bar on the Orient Express. History Construction and early history The Ritz under construction in October 1905 Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz, the former manager of the Savoy Hotel, opened the hotel on 25 May 1906. It was built on the site which had been the Old White Horse Cellar, which by 1805 was one of the best known coaching inns in England. The financial backers of the Ritz felt that they had secured one of the prime sites in London for their project. They began negotiations in 1901, and completed the transactions for the simultaneous purchase of the leasehold for the Walsingham House Hotel and the adjacent freehold estate of the Bath Hotel for ¬£250,000 in 1902. Demolition of both of the hotels began in 1904. The building is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during the Belle √âpoque to resemble a stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. Its architects were Charles Mew√®s, who had previously designed Ritz's H√¥tel Ritz Paris, and Arthur Davis, with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander. It was one of the earliest substantial steel frame structures in London, the Savoy Hotel extension of 1903-04 being the first in the capital. Many of the materials used in the construction of the hotel were US-made. The initial fees for suites ranged from 1 1/2 guineas to 3 1/2 guineas. After opening, a long-running feud between the hotel and Lord Wimbourne, a steel magnate who lived next door at Wimbourne House, lasted for years in a dispute over land. A number of locals were also concerned about the building and the impact it would have on their health. While the Ritz was still under construction, a series of events highlighted the need for another luxury hotel in London. A 3June 1905 Daily Mail news story reported it was both Derby Week and the height of the tourist season, making hotel accommodation almost impossible to find. The Savoy had to refuse reservations, while Buckingham Palace turned offices into makeshift hotel rooms for visitors. An estimated 2,500 more persons needing rooms were expected shortly with the coming visit of the King of Spain. Though the opening of the Savoy had brought about a marked change in how hotels provided services to its guests, Ritz was determined that his London hotel would surpass its competitor in their delivery. The Ritz installed two large lead-lined tanks on its roof to provide a steady stream of hot and cold water. The hotel's bathrooms were all spacious with each having its own heated towel bar. Every bedroom in the hotel was provided with its own working fireplace. Ritz shunned free-standing wardrobes due to his fear of dust settling on them; instead he built cupboards into the rooms with doors matching the panelling. Ritz's ideas of cleanliness and hygiene prompted him to originally have all bedrooms painted in white and all beds made of brass, not wood, for the same reasons. Anything new or potentially useful was available to the guests of the Ritz. C√©sar Ritz's health had declined after his 1902 collapse at the Carlton, but he was feeling well enough to assume an active role in the plans for the hotel's opening dinner on 24 May 1906. Unlike the opening of the Paris Ritz, which had catered to society, most of those invited to the Ritz, London opening were members of the national and international press. Major British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and The Daily Telegraph were invited to the dinner along with newspapers which included the Berliner Tageblatt, The Sydney Morning Herald and The New York Times. Ritz's guest list also included the engineer and architects of the structure along with key staff members of the new hotel and their wives. The hotel was not immensely profitable in its opening years; smaller than many of the new hotels springing up in that period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented by many of the London elite who considered it vulgar. It took ¬£3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, and the hotel lost over ¬£50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of the manager Elles with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant. The hotel also suffered a blow upon the death of King Edward in 1910, when 38 planned dinners and functions were cancelled, but began to prosper the following year, made fashionable by the Prince of Wales who regularly dined here. King Edward was particularly fond of the cakes made at the Ritz. The hotel would regularly send him a supply, but this was kept in confidence as the King's chef may not have wanted it known that food he did not prepare was served at Buckingham Palace. Ritz retained control of much of the hotel's operation for many years. He hired world-famous chef Auguste Escoffier to provide cuisine to match the opulence of the hotel's decorations; he placed a special bell in the entryway by which the doorman could notify the staff of the impending arrival of royalty. By 1929 the hotel was still being praised for its architecture; Professor Charles Reilly wrote about the Ritz in Building magazine in 1929, calling it the \\"finest modern structure\\" in the street, with \\"an elegance of general form\\". High society The Palm Court of the Ritz in 1907 Dining Room at the Ritz On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper's future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined at the Ritz with the Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (n√©e Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and later that day announced that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables at the Ritz Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly ¬£50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at the Ritz in the spring of 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant. In September 1917, a shell exploded in Green Park in close proximity to the Ritz, and according to Lord Ivor Churchill it broke all of the windows to adjacent Wimbourne House. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, organised by Sir Basil Zaharoff, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. The Duke of Marlborough recorded dining at the Ritz; \\"I lunched at the Ritz. The whole social world goes there, prices being cheap. All women there from M. Paget to the latest tart.\\" Charlie Chaplin at the Ritz in 1921 When asked to summarise hotels in London in the early 1920s, Barbara Cartland remarked that \\"The Ritz stood for stuffiness and standards, the Carlton was for businessman, the Savoy was rather fast, some other ones were frankly scandalous, and the Berkeley, where you could dance all night for ten shillings, was for the young\\". In 1921, Bonvin, the manager of the Ritz, died, and was replaced with J.S. Walters. Walters was a \\"tireless salesman\\" in promoting the hotel, especially in mainland Europe, and flaunted the hotel in the Tatler at a time when it was unpopular to do so. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma frequented the Ritz from his time as a Sub- Lieutenant onwards, and when his friend Charlie Chaplin arrived in London in September 1921 after a nine-year absence, great crowds gathered at Waterloo station and Chaplin had to be ushered to the hotel by some 40 policemen. He stayed in the first-floor Regal Suite and was photographed throwing carnations to his fans from the Arlington Street balcony. The Ritz became popular with film stars and executives when staying in London, although the hotel has kept most of the names of many of its luminaries a secret in its records. Douglas Fairbanks was known though to frequent the Ritz in the 1920s, and director Alexander Korda's talent scout held a table at the Ritz in the 1930s. No√´l Coward, also a regular diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s, met with Michael Arlen in the restaurant in 1924 to discuss the urgent problem of generating the funding for his new play, The Vortex. Arlen gave Coward a cheque for $250 without question, and The Vortex would go on to be his first major success. Coward's song, \\"Children of the Ritz\\", which featured in the 1932 revue Words and Music was penned while Coward was lunching in the Ritz with Beverley Nichols. Numerous authors began to meet at the Ritz during the same period, and it began to creep into literature itself. In Michael Arlen's 1922 novel Piracy, the hotel was described as a \\"very stout and solid building in the manner of the old Bastille, originally conceived no doubt with a fearful eye on class prejudice\\", and R. Firbank had a running gag in his novels about there being \\"fleas in the Ritz\\". Later, the hotel appears in Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time. The narrator Nicholas Jenkins meets poet Mark Members at the Ritz, and the golden nymph in the Palm Court of the hotel is mentioned. The future Edward VIII, a regular at the hotel in the 1930s, where he practised his dancing skills. William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan, who succeeded Harry Higgins as chairman of the Ritz upon his death in 1928, was especially keen on attracting American guests to the hotel. He was a close friend of the Earl of Carnavon and his American wife Catherine Wendell, and at times the couple were freely given the entire second floor of the hotel to accommodate guests. Upon the death of Lord Lurgan in 1937, Carnavon was told that he had to begin paying for his staying at the hotel, but was given a \\"slight reduction for old time's sake\\". Carnarvon later remarked: \\"The Ritz has been my London home for over fifty years. I'm very fond of the place. Nobody knows it better\\". In 1931, the Aga Khan was involved with organising the Round Table Conference at the hotel, which was attended by Mahatma Gandhi and many others. On one occasion the Aga Khan took over the Palm Court to hold a meeting with his followers. In the 1930s, Aletto became the restaurant manager of the Ritz, a \\"popular and much-mimicked character\\" according to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin. The future Edward VIII and his associates were often seen at the Ritz in the 1930s. In 1932 the Evening Standard observed the Prince performing on the dance floor: \\"The Prince of Wales never misses an opportunity to raise the stand of his dancing... He danced three tangoes each of which lasted about thirty-five minutes!\\" In 1934, Edward's brother, the Duke of Kent, married Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark at the Ritz and scaffolding was put up in the garden for the celebration. The Queen Mother would also attend private parties at the Ritz during this period, as did King Boris of Bulgaria and Queen Marie of Romania. At one point, the Ritz hosted four reigning monarchs simultaneously: King Boris, King Farouk of Egypt, Spain's King Alfonso and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. After the romance of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson became public knowledge, both parties could be found at separate tables near the restaurant's door, in case a speedy exit was necessary. The Ritz suffered from the effects of the General Strike of 1926, subsequently seeing competition from the likes of the Dorchester Hotel and Grosvenor House. The Great Depression brought a sharp decline in business to the hotel, and in the summer of 1931 staff wages were reduced‚Äîthe chefs, kitchen workers and the directors had a 25% cut in their wages. To increase earnings, in 1935 Fred Cavendish-Bentinck recommended that the hotel commence putting on a Cabaret show. Advertised in the Evening Standard, the programme was an immediate success. In January 1936, Austrian comedian Vic Oliver was one of the entertainers hired to perform at the hotel for two weeks, and Cyril Fletcher appeared in the show for a month the following year. The BBC began broadcasting live performances from the restaurant of the hotel, with pianist Billy Milton and others. It was through the show that the Irving Berlin song \\"Puttin' On the Ritz\\" grew in popularity, performed by Joe Kaye's Dance Band. In 1937, James Stephens shortly succeeded Lurgan as director of the Ritz before being replaced by Hans Pfyffer von Altishofen, who had been on the board of the Ritz Hotel Development Company from 1910 and was also the chairman of the Paris Ritz. World War II Zog I of Albania lived at the Ritz from 1940 to 1941. During World War II, the Ritz became integral to political and social life among the elite, and a number of eminent royals, aristocrats and politicians moved into the hotel. Camilla Russell, the wife of writer Christopher Sykes, stated that the Ritz \\"enjoyed a tremendous vogue during the war and was, even more than ever, much used as a meeting place\\", and at night was \\"crowded yet somehow safe\\". Angela, Countess of Antrim, Syke's sister, remarked that the Ritz was the ideal meeting place for \\"gathering news of husbands at the wars\\". Emerald Cunard took up residence in the Ritz for a period, but later moved to the Dorchester. In the summer of 1940, the Albanian royal family, including King Zog I, Queen Geraldine, Crown Prince Leka, the King's six sisters, two nieces, three nephews and others moved into the hotel and were given their own floor, escorted by a chamberlain, the Albanian diplomats from Paris, and numerous bodyguards. Zog brought the royal gold and jewels with him, which were kept in the storeroom of the Ritz before being deposited in the Bank of England. Due to Zog's concerns about safety during air raids, the ladies' cloakroom was converted into a private shelter for the Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in the Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice. Edvard Bene≈° would entertain guests at a private luncheon at the hotel several times a week during the war years. In 1942, Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle met in the Marie Antoinette suite of the hotel to discuss operations, Brendan Bracken, who served as an observer and mouthpiece on political society in London, and Anglo-American politician Ronald Tree spent much time at the Ritz, and Tree lived there during the winter of 1940. Laura Long, who would later become Laura Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, the second wife of John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough, the architectural writer James Lees-Milne, Harold Acton and writer Norman Douglas were regular diners at the Ritz during wartime. According to Alastair Forbes and Felix Hope- Nicholson, during World War II, the basement bar at the Ritz was reserved for gay and lesbian guests, while the one upstairs was for heterosexual guests. Hope Nicholson described it as \\"notoriously queer\\", and stated that \\"the Ritz bar became too chic, too popular and above all, too queer for the authorities\\". Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, MP Harold Nicolson, Brian Howard, and Pauline Tennant were all regulars at the basement bar. Post-war years J. Paul Getty, reputedly the richest man in the world at the time, lived at the Ritz after the war. The hotel was owned for some thirty years by the Bracewell-Smith family, who also had significant stakes in the nearby Park Lane Hotel. Although the family were quick to earn a profit from the hotel, there was a turbulent period in the years after World War II, with a workers strike in 1946, and the restaurant attracting significant criticism in its quality of cuisine. On one occasion, a group of patrons of the Ritz, known as the \\"Friends of the Ritz\\", met with Sir Bracewell Smith in Park Lane Hotel to complain about the standards; Smith himself dined at the Ritz and informed them that it was quite satisfactory. Several suicides also darkened the reputation of the Ritz in the postwar years, including that of horse trainer Peter Beatty from the sixth floor window in October 1949, and that of French gangster Baron Pierre de Laitre, who strangled love interest Eileen Hill to death in his second floor room in March 1953 when she refused to marry him, before killing himself by stuffing a silk sock down his throat. Nonetheless the Ritz continued to be a social hub for the aristocracy and attract the world's elite in the 1950s. It was very popular with the wealthy family of the Aga Khan, and oil magnate J. Paul Getty, reputedly the richest man in the world at the time, lived at the Ritz after the war. On one occasion a photographer working for Time and Life magazines staged an incident outside the hotel by arranging for the barrowboy to pour coppers onto the pavement as Getty emerged from the hotel and photographed just as he went to pick them up. Shell Oil heiress Olga Deterding lived at hotel for several years, and in one altercation with her lover she threw his trousers out of the window. In 1956 she tired of the high life and spent a period working at Albert Schweitzer's leper colony in French Equatorial Africa. Film stars Rita Hayworth and Tallulah Bankhead were regular guests at the hotel; Hayworth was married to Prince Aly Khan between 1949 and 1953. Another notable resident of the Ritz during this period was Nubar Gulbenkian, an \\"expansive extrovert\\" who kept a permanent suite at the Ritz and made exorbitant demands for luxuries and foods, even if out of season. In January 1959, Patrice Lumumba, the Prime Minister of Congo, stayed at the hotel and met with Sir Edward Adjaye, the Ghanaian High Commissioner in London and others in the restaurant. The event was picketed by Mosleyites, who in concern with human rights issues in Congo at the time, demonstrated outside of the hotel, displaying banners such as \\"RAPERS OF CHILDREN ‚Äì GO HOME\\" and issuing racial epithets. Adjaye was attacked as he left the hotel, although it has been speculated that he was mistaken for Lumumba. George Criticos served as head porter of the Ritz for 45 years, retiring in 1960 for health reasons; he had been recommended for a job at the Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff. In his 1959 book, George of the Ritz, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance. When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel, he called out to the man to stop him. When the man turned to face Criticos, he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria, who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train. Later history Afternoon tea at the Ritz The Long Gallery The social scene changed dramatically in London in the 1960s, with Beatlemania and the sexual revolution, and British aristocracy in the capital was not what it had been. By this time the general impeccable standards of the Ritz had fallen. Peregrine Worsthorne noted the change: \\"Precisely that it was not all Ritzy, in the sense of being conspicuously luxurious...the glitter had long since faded and shabbiness set in. The place was usually empty, kept alive by memories of former glories and a clientele who preferred nostalgia to comfort\\". Yet celebrities often held parties at the hotel, and the Rolling Stones were guests for many years. British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and Harold Macmillan often lunched at the Ritz; Heath would always reserve table 29 in the restaurant. In the 1970s, the hotel fell into a turbulent period. Terrorist threats from the Provisional Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for ¬£2.75 million. At the time of the sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie. The Barclay twins of The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for ¬£80 million from Trafalgar House, in October 1995, through their company Ellerman Investments. They spent eight years and ¬£40 million restoring it to its former grandeur. Two years after the death of Princess Diana, the Prince and Camilla Parker-Bowles made their first public appearance together at the Ritz, as they left a birthday party for Parker-Bowles' sister. The couple returned to the hotel in November 2002 for the Prince's birthday party attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. In 2002, the Ritz became the first hotel to receive the Royal Warrant from his Royal Highness The Prince of Wales for banqueting and catering services. The Ritz acquired the adjoining Wimbourne House in 2005. On 27 January 2007, around 300 people were evacuated to the nearby May Fair Hotel following a fire alarm in the hotel. No one was hurt in the blaze, which started in the basement casino kitchen's extraction vents. The Ritz casino only suffered \\"minor damage\\". Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was convalescing at the Ritz when she died following a stroke on 8 April 2013. There has been criticism because the Ritz has not paid any corporation tax since being taken over by the Barclay twins. The accounts indicate that the profitable hotel uses a series of tax reliefs to reduce its corporation tax to zero. David Barclay‚Äôs son, Aidan, has stated that the company abides by UK law. Architecture Elevation diagram of the Ritz A typical floor plan in the Ritz Authors Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin describe the Ritz as \\"the product of one of those near miraculous convergences of civilised patron and architects and craftsmen of genius working together in complete harmony both with each other and with the social and architectural fashions of the day. The building has been regarded as a masterpiece from the day it was finished...\\" Both of the architects, Charles Mew√®s and Arthur J. Davis, were educated at the prestigious √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and the education which they received is clear in the design of the buildings, particularly the Renaissance influence, delivering \\"an authentic fabric of traditional French classicism\\". Mew√®s had previously designed the Hotel Ritz of Paris for Cesar in 1897‚Äì8, after which he met Arthur Davis, and began working together preparing designs for the Grand Petit Palais in the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Both architects worked on the plans for the London Ritz in 1904‚Äì5. According to Montgomery- Massingberd and Watkin the exterior is both structurally and visually Franco- American in influence with little trace of English architecture. For them the exterior \\"represents an evocative confluence of various Parisian architectural traditions\\"; the Piccadilly arcade echoes the arcaded ground floor in the Place Vendrome and the Rue de Rivoli, the steep mansarded skyline on the Green Park facade echoes Hector Lefuel's work on the Pavillon de Flore of the Louvre, while the tall windows and wall panels of the facades resemble those of Mew√®s's earlier work on a smaller building made as a home for Jules Ferry on Rue Bayard. The front of the London Ritz Excavation for the hotel began by contractors Waring White Building Co. Ltd in June 1904, and it was completed by 1 October 1905, and opened the following May. The building progress was documented each month by The Builder's Journal and Architectural Engineer, and in one edition noted the difficulties of some of the aspects of construction such as hoisting 20-ton steel joists in a narrow building site. The Architect and Contract Reporter noted that the limited space did not allow for the storage of materials on site. All mortar had to be mixed in the basement and the stone was dressed \\"on a platform with a watertight roof over the footway\\". The red-brick foundations of the earlier Walsingham House had to be blasted away to facilitate the foundations of the steel structure in concrete. The total estimated cost was ¬£345,227. 8s. 1d., with ¬£102,000 going to Messrs Waring and Gillow, ¬£49,000 to French decorators and over ¬£15,000 to the English decorators. John P. Bishop and the Swedish-born Sven Bylander were consultant engineers during the building phase. The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly , on the Arlington Street side, and on the Green Park side. The irregularity of the site presented initial problems for the builders. Davis dealt with this by \\"brilliant perspective effects\\" according to Binney, using curving walls to \\"cleverly conceal the rapidly diminishing space at the back of the hotel\\". The purpose of the arcaded front was to provide more space for the bedrooms above. Expensive Norwegian granite is the material on ground floor, with Portland stone above it. The steel frame of the building was made in Germany and is based on a model made in the early 1880s in Chicago to increase fire resistance. It was erected by Messrs Potts & Co. of Oxford Street. Fireproofing of the walls were conducted by the Columbian Fireproofing Company Ltd. of Pittsburgh and London, with steel-ribbed bars allowing for ventilation, while remaining sound proof and free from vibration. The internal walls consist of \\"hollow, porous, terra-cotta blocks\\" covered with plaster, and the hotel's flooring was also made fireproof. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. Interior Ground floor of the Ritz The hotel was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, which is consistent throughout, giving the hotel its \\"special atmosphere of perfect appropriateness and elegant restraint\\". Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as \\"one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture\\" and compares it to a royal palace with its \\"grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers\\". Waring & Gallow were responsible for many of the fine design work of the interiors The ground floor plan dated to 1906 illustrated a large main restaurant overlooking the terrace and garden, a large central Grand Gallery and Winter Garden, a circular vestibule beyond the reception room, the Marie Antoinette Suite near the restaurant, and numerous shops. The Grill Room had its own entrance on the right side of the entrance doors on Piccadilly, with a staircase leading down. The Grill Room was on the eastern side, and the Banqueting Hall lay at the western end, beneath the restaurant. Today this is home to the Ritz Club. A wide vaulted corridor, the Long Gallery, runs from the Arlington Street entrance on the east side to the restaurant on the west side, with finely woven Savonnerie carpets. Along it are several intricate horseshoe archways. A triangular-shaped staircase features in the building's southwest corner. The curving main staircase was built to allow women to make a \\"dramatic entrance and show off their gowns to best effect\\". The Palm Court The Palm Court The Ritz's most widely known facility is the Palm Court, an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting. It is decorated with lavish furnishings, including gilded Louis XVI armchairs with oval backs, which the architects had designed based on research into French neo-classical furniture design of the 1760s and 1770s, which were made by Waring and Gillow. The room, with its, \\"panelled mirrors of bevelled glass in gilt bronze frames\\" and \\"high coving ornamented with gilded trellis-work\\", according to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin \\"epitomizes the elegantly frivolous comfort of Edwardian high life\\". There were originally large windows at either end of the court, then known as the Winter Garden, and were replaced with twenty panels of mirrors after 1972. The fountain of the court, known as \\"La Source\\", is made of Echaillon marble and is extravagantly sculpted. A nymph, gold in colour, is featured in a lair. A wrought-iron and glass roof of the Palm Court contains two gilded wrought-iron lanterns, and the ceiling contains lion skin motifs. The room is done in soft apricot and has remained so since 1906. C√©sar Ritz chose the colour to flatter the complexions of women after weeks of experimentation with various hues. The Palm Court is the setting for the world-famous institution that is \\"Tea at the Ritz\\", once frequented by King Edward VII, Sir Winston Churchill, No√´l Edmonds, Judy Garland, Evelyn Waugh and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. It acquired its reputation as \\"the place for tea\\" in London after World War I. In the 1920s a small orchestra would play regularly on the court; film producer John Sutro for instance recalled that Hermione Baddeley once requested the violinist to \\"play something hot\\". Between the Winter Garden and the central Grand Gallery is a screen featuring two Ionic columns. Dining The Ritz restaurant Exterior of the restaurant on Piccadilly The hotel has six private dining rooms, the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its boiserie, and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House. Marcus Binney states that the restaurant is \\"not only one of the most beautiful interiors in London, it can be claimed as the most beautiful restaurant in the world\\". C√©sar Ritz once commented that the room was so heavily designed in bronze that it was fortunate that the hotel was built from steel, or the \\"walls would collapse with the weight of all that bronze\\". Flanking the entrance to the main restaurant are two life-sized figures set in \\"bronze vert after Clodion, holding gilded bronze lustres with six lights each, mounted on pedestals of polished Echaillon marble ornamented with bronze\\". The restaurant and adjacent guest room were designed by P. H. Remon and Sons of Paris. The ceiling is a described by Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin as a \\"painted trompe-l'oeil ceiling on which pinkish clouds drift across the blue sky encircled by a garlanded balustrade\\". Bronze chandeliers are also a feature, influenced by an 18th-century Augustin de Saint-Aubin engraving known as Le Bal Pare et Masque, and Le Festin by Moreau le Jeune, which was given by the City of Paris to the King and Queen on 21 January 1782. On the northern end against the Piccadilly arcade are floor-to-ceiling mirrors, divided into panes, which give the room a spacious effect, especially when the lights are on all day during the winter. At the south end of the restaurant is a watercolour by Davis and gilded figures known as \\"The Thames and the Ocean\\", with a buffet made from Norwegian pink marble below it, believed to be inspired by Louis Seize's \\"Buffet of Mansart\\". Dining service at the Ritz During the 1977 major renovation of the hotel, the scaffolding used in the project was hidden by a clean cloth during mealtimes in the Louis XVI restaurant so as not to upset diners with a possibly disturbing sight. During the renovation, the columns in the hotel's lobbies were stripped of many coats of cream-coloured paint to display their original pink marble. Most of the work done in the renovation was done to restore and clean while keeping the original 1906 colour scheme. Much of the furniture from the original opening was still in use; new items were faithful copies styled after the originals. The hotel retained its nightstand call buttons for maid, waiter, valet and servant, refusing to make its patrons dial a telephone for services. From its inception, the kitchen was run mainly by French chefs, and it had a specialist in Russian soups and Viennese pastry; its cakes became so famous that King Edward made regular orders from Buckingham Palace. M. Malley, who had been saucier at the Paris Ritz was appointed Chef des Cuisines, and invented dishes such as Saumon Marquise de Sevignre (Salmon with a crayfish mousse), Filet de Sole Romanoff (served with mussels, small slices of apple and artichokes), and Poulet en Chaudfroid (chicken accompanied by a curry-flavoured pinkish mousse) at the hotel. The Ritz is renowned for its supreme catering service, as well as using its fine rooms for conferencing between executives and directors of multi-national firms. A table at the restaurant still needs to be booked weeks in advance. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to look like a bar on the Orient Express. The lounge was decorated by Marcel Boulanger in the Louis VIV style, the clubroom was by Lenygon and Morant, who were influenced by the Palladian design of Cumberland House in Brettingham, and other rooms were decorated with clear William Chambers and Robert Adam influences. Meals can be served on Nanking china in the Trafalgar Suite. The banquet and catering services received a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales in 2005. Marie Antoinette Suite  The Marie Antoinette Suite in 1914 The Marie Antoinette Suite is accessed from the main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney \\"the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice\\". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with \\"flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes\\". In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with \\"drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons\\". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on \\"cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels\\". The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, in contrast to the window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by \\"clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding\\", according to Binney. Rooms and suites A Junior Suite at the Ritz As of 2015, The Ritz London has 136 guestrooms, of which 111 are bedrooms and 25 are suites. The main bedrooms are divided into three principal categories: Superior Queen/King/Twin, Executive King/Twin and Deluxe King/Twin. The Superior Queen and King rooms are and in size respectively, while the Executive and Deluxe king rooms are and The suites are divided into the categories: Junior Suite, Superior Suite, Executive Suite, Deluxe Suite, the Trafalgar Suite and the Berkeley Suite, and also include the signature suites the Royal Suite and the Prince of Wales Suite, each with their own unique style. The Executive Suites typically face south, and are in size, with a small lounge area and antique furniture. The Junior Suites, with \\"fireplaces, gilded mouldings and antique furniture\\" are above Piccadilly, and are in size, while the 3-5 bedroom suites range in size from to . William Kent House William Kent House, also known as Wimbourne House, was opened as an extension of the Ritz. The house has been converted into a complete function area with the Music Room, the Burlington Room, the Queen Elizabeth Room and the William Kent room. It also accommodates three of the Ritz' top suites: The Arlington Suite, the Royal Suite as well as the Prince of Wales Suite. Several of the rooms have Louis XVI chimneypieces. The Grade II building was carefully restored and given a modern touch with period furnishings concealing things like flat screen televisions. The restoration won a Royal Institute of British Architects national gold medal in 2007. The Ritz Club The original Ritz ballroom in 1906 Sign above the western entrance to the arcade The Ritz Club is a casino in the basement of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill. In the original structure, this was where the Ritz ballroom was located. A May 1906 edition of Truth magazine described the basement with the Grill Room and Banqueting Hall as palatial, ivory-white in decor, with \\"mirrors on all the walls reflecting an endless intersection of arched ceilings\\". The rooms were used for dinners, balls and theatrical shows, with a stage at the south end of the Banqueting Hall. By the mid 1920s the Grill Room had been relocated into the Banqueting Hall, and furnished with circular tables with oval back wicker chairs. One 1926 brochure stated that it was the scene of \\"some of the finest private and public balls ever given in London\\". During World War II it became known as the nightclub La Popote. The interior of the club was made to simulate a combat dugout complete with sandbags. The club's chandeliers were made out of various types of empty liquor bottles with candles in their necks for light. The dance floor was crowded during wartime, but it later declined in popularity. Laurie Ross was in charge of the Ritz Bar and Grill for many years. The bar, known to its regulars as \\"Laurie's Bar\\", closed when Ross retired in 1976. By the 1970s the basement rooms were closed to the public. In 1977, Trafalgar House agreed to lease the basement to Mecca Sportsman and Pleasurama, and the Ritz Club was opened the following year, under separate management from the hotel. The basement was restored in the hotel's Louis XVI style of 1906, and the decorations included 6,000 sheets of gold leaf. Gold leaf was not spared on moldings, cupids and garlands and a blue sky with fluffy clouds painted on the ceiling above the gaming tables. The restoration consisted of repainting, cleaning and recovering all in the original color scheme. Furniture was restored to its original state and replicas replaced what could not be restored. Stephen Pulman was appointed Head Chef, after being recruited from the exclusive club and restaurant Annabel‚Äôs.\\" Posh Casino To Help Restore The Ritz To Bygone Opulence\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune, When it opened, the Ritz Club was open to members and hotel guests only.London Hotel And Casino Review, January 2006, Volume 7, pge 34 However, unlike most casinos, it charges a fee to enter.Gambler's World Guide, Volume 3, page 7 The games are considered \\"high stakes\\" in that the minimum bet is usually very high. They offer roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines.Las Vegas News & Review, Volume17, Issue 7, page 39 In 1998, the club was purchased by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to the basement of the Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas‚Äîthe restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In popular culture Evelyn Waugh's 1942 novel Work Suspended features a scene at the Ritz in which the narrator falls in love with a friend's wife during a luncheon. Alan Bennett's allegorical play, Forty Years On was later set in the basement of the Ritz during the war. In the universe of the book Good Omens, two primary characters, the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley, often frequent the Ritz. The hotel is mentioned in the song \\"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\\" as well as in Queen's \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\". Large portions of the 1999 romantic comedy Notting Hill were filmed in and around the hotel. Controversy In recent years the Ritz has taken measures to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, even though they had been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz changed its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.

Most speak either one of the many languages of the Austronesian language family, especially ones in the Oceanic branch, or from one of the many unrelated families of Papuan languages. Other languages are the several creoles of the region, such as Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu, Solomon Islands Pijin, Bislama, and Papuan Malay. A 2011 survey found that 92.1% of Melanesians are Christians.Christianity in its Global Context, 1970‚Äì2020 Society, Religion, and Mission, Center for the Study of Global Christianity Origin and genetics The original inhabitants of the group of islands now named Melanesia were likely the ancestors of the present- day Papuan people. They appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the Solomon Islands, including Makira and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east. Particularly along the north coast of New Guinea and in the islands north and east of New Guinea, the Austronesian people, who had migrated into the area more than 3,000 years ago, came into contact with these pre-existing populations of Papuan-speaking peoples. In the late 20th century, some scholars theorized a long period of interaction, which resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture among the peoples. It was proposed that, from this area, a very small group of people (speaking an Austronesian language) departed to the east to become the forebears of the Polynesian people. The indigenous Melanesian populations are thus often classified into two main groups based on differences in language, culture or genetic ancestry: the Papuan-speaking and Austronesian-speaking groups. A Fijian mountain warrior, photograph by Francis Herbert Dufty, 1870s. This Polynesian theory was overturned by a 2008 study, which was based on genome scans and evaluation of more than 800 genetic markers among a wide variety of Pacific peoples. It found that neither Polynesians nor Micronesians have much genetic relation to Melanesians. Both groups are strongly related genetically to East Asians, particularly Taiwanese aborigines. It appeared that, having developed their sailing outrigger canoes, the ancestors of the Polynesians migrated from East Asia, moved through the Melanesian area quickly on their way, and kept going to eastern areas, where they settled. They left little genetic evidence in Melanesia, \\"and only intermixed to a very modest degree with the indigenous populations there\\". Nevertheless, the study still found a small Austronesian genetic signature (below 20%) in less than half of the Melanesian groups who speak Austronesian languages, and which was entirely absent in the Papuan-speaking groups. The study found a high rate of genetic differentiation and diversity among the groups living within the Melanesian islands, with the peoples not only distinguished between the islands, but also by the languages, topography, and size of an island. Such diversity developed over the tens of thousands of years since initial settlement, as well as after the more recent arrival of Polynesian ancestors at the islands. Papuan- speaking groups in particular were found to be the most differentiated, while Austronesian-speaking groups along the coastlines were more intermixed.\\"Genome Scans Show Polynesians Have Little Genetic Relationship to Melanesians\\", Press Release, Temple University, 17 January 2008, accessed 19 July 2015 Further DNA analysis has taken research into new directions, as more human species have been discovered since the late 20th century. Based on his genetic studies of the Denisova hominin, an ancient human species discovered in 2010, Svante P√§√§bo claims that ancient human ancestors of the Melanesians interbred in Asia with these humans. He has found that people of New Guinea share 4%‚Äì6% of their genome with the Denisovans, indicating this exchange. The Denisovans are considered cousin to the Neanderthals. Both groups are now understood to have migrated out of Africa, with the Neanderthals going into Europe, and the Denisovans heading east about 400,000 years ago. This is based on genetic evidence from a fossil found in Siberia. The evidence from Melanesia suggests their territory extended into south Asia, where ancestors of the Melanesians developed. Melanesians of some islands are one of the few non-European peoples, and the only dark-skinned group of people outside Australia, known to have blond hair. The blonde trait developed via the TYRP1 gene, which is not the same gene that causes blondness in European blonds. History of classification Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an 'old black race' in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin. By 1825 Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent developed a more elaborate, 15-race model of human diversity. He described the inhabitants of modern-day Melanesia as M√©laniens, a distinct racial group from the Australian and Neptunian (i.e. Polynesian) races surrounding them. In 1832 Dumont D'Urville expanded and simplified much of this earlier work. He classified the peoples of Oceania into four racial groups: Malayans, Polynesians, Micronesians, and Melanesians. D'Urville's model differed from that of Bory de Saint-Vincent in referring to 'Melanesians' rather than 'M√©laniens.' Bory de Saint-Vincent had distinguished M√©laniens from the indigenous Australians. Dumont D'Urville combined the two peoples into one group. Lamaholot people from Flores island, Indonesia. Many of the present Southern Mongoloid populations of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia (including Singapore) also have a high degree of Australo-Melanesian genetic heritage. Soares et al. (2008) have argued for an older pre-Holocene Sundaland origin in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) based on mitochondrial DNA. The \\"out of Taiwan model\\" was challenged by a study from Leeds University and published in Molecular Biology and Evolution. Examination of mitochondrial DNA lineages shows that they have been evolving in ISEA for longer than previously believed. Ancestors of the Polynesians arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea at least 6,000 to 8,000 years ago.DNA Sheds New Light on Polynesian Migration Paternal Y chromosome analysis by Kayser et al. (2000) also showed that Polynesians have significant Melanesian genetic admixture. A follow-up study by Kayser et al. (2008) discovered that only 21% of the Polynesian autosomal gene pool is of Melanesian origin, with the rest (79%) being of East Asian origin. A study by Friedlaender et al. (2008) confirmed that Polynesians are closer genetically to Micronesians, Taiwanese Aborigines, and East Asians, than to Melanesians. The study concluded that Polynesians moved through Melanesia fairly rapidly, allowing only limited admixture between Austronesians and Melanesians. Thus, the high frequencies of B4a1a1 are the result of drift and represent the descendants of a very few successful East Asian females.Assessing Y-chromosome Variation in the South Pacific Using Newly Detected, by Krista Erin Latham Austronesian languages and cultural traits Austronesian languages and cultural traits were introduced along the north and south-east coasts of New Guinea and in some of the islands north and east of New Guinea by migrating Austronesians, probably starting over 3,500 years ago. This was followed by long periods of interaction that resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture. It was once postulated that from this area a very small group of people (speaking an Austronesian language) departed to the east and became the forebears of the Polynesian people. This theory was, however, contradicted by a study published by Temple University finding that Polynesians and Micronesians have little genetic relation to Melanesians; instead, they found significant distinctions between groups living within the Melanesian islands. A genetic link has been identified as Polynesians are dominated by a type of macro-haplogroup C y-DNA, which is a minority lineage in Melanesia and have a very low frequency of the dominant Melanesian y-DNA which is K2b1, which complicates matters. A significant minority of them also belongs to Haplogroup O-M175. See also correction in: Current Biology, vol. 11, no. 2, pages 141‚Äì142 (23 Jan. 2001). Some recent studies suggest that all humans outside of Sub-Saharan Africa have inherited some genes from Neanderthals, and that Melanesians are the only known modern humans whose prehistoric ancestors interbred with the Denisova hominin, sharing 4%‚Äì6% of their genome with this ancient cousin of the Neanderthal. Incidence of blond hair in Melanesia Blond hair is rare in native populations outside of Europe and North Africa. It evolved independently in Melanesia, where Melanesians of some islands (along with some indigenous Australians) are one of a few groups not descended from Europeans who have blond hair. This has been traced to an allele of TYRP1 unique to these people, and is not the same gene that causes blond hair in Europeans. As with blond hair that arose in Europe and parts of Asia, incidence of blondness is more common in children than in adults, with hair tending to darken as the individual matures.

Melanesian areas of Oceania The predominantly Melanesian areas of Oceania include parts of the Maluku Islands (Moluccas) of Eastern Indonesia, New Guinea and surrounding islands, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji. New Caledonia and nearby Loyalty Islands for most of their history have had a majority Melanesian population, but the proportion has dropped to 43% in the face of modern immigration.

Being one of the most prominent Icelandic poets, the Hallgr√≠mskirkja in Reykjav√≠k and the Hallgr√≠mskirkja in Saurb√¶r are named in his honor. He was one of the most influential pastors during the Age of Orthodoxy (1580‚Äì1713). Because of his contributions to Lutheran hymnody, he is sometimes called the Icelandic Paul Gerhardt.  Biography  The Hallgr√≠mskirkja in Saurb√¶r. Hallgr√≠mur P√©tursson was likely born at Gr√∂f in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur. He grew up at H√≥lar, where his father was the bell-ringer and his cousin Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson the resident bishop. As a young man, he left H√≥lar for unknown reasons and travelled to mainland Europe, possibly to learn the blacksmith trade. He ended in Copenhagen, where Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson sponsored him to attend the seminary at the Church of Our Lady. Brynj√≥lfur had family connections to Hallgr√≠mur, as his half-brother was married to Hallgr√≠mur's aunt. According to folk legend, Brynj√≥lfur first encountered Hallgr√≠mur by chance when travelling through Gl√ºckstadt in the Duchy of Schleswig (then under Danish rule). Hallgr√≠mur's blacksmith employer mistreated the boy, and in passing Brynj√≥lfur heard Hallgr√≠mur curse his employer in Icelandic. Brynj√≥lfur took pity on the young Icelander and saw to it that the boy was educated. During his last year of study there, Hallgr√≠mur was employed to re-educate a group of Icelanders who had been kidnapped by Barbary pirates in the Turkish Abductions in 1627 and ransomed ten years later. Among them was a woman, Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur S√≠monard√≥ttir, sixteen years Hallgr√≠mur's senior, with whom he fell in love. Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur was married to a man from the Westman Islands, who had not been captured in the raid. After Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur became pregnant by Hallgr√≠mur, he left the seminary and returned with the group to Iceland. On their arrival it emerged that Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur's husband had died, leaving her a widow; she and Hallgr√≠mur promptly married and he worked as a labourer for a number of years. Seven years after Hallgr√≠mur's return to Iceland, Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson, his former sponsor and then bishop at Sk√°lholt, appointed Hallgr√≠mur as minister at Hvalsnes. Some people were surprised that the ungraduated worker should be ordained, but Hallgr√≠mur showed himself a skillful preacher. In 1651, he was reassigned to Saurb√¶r in Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, a much sought-after position. He served there until his death in 1674 from leprosy.  Works  Hallgr√≠mur P√©tursson's most notable work is Passion Hymns (Pass√≠us√°lmar or, in full, \\"Historia p√≠nunnar og dau√∞ans Drottins vors Jes√∫ Kristi, me√∞ hennar s√©rlegustu l√¶rd√≥ms-, √°minningar- og huggunargreinum, √°samt b√¶num og √æakkargj√∂r√∞um, √≠ s√°lmum og s√∂ngv√≠sum me√∞ √Ωmsum t√≥num samsett og skrifu√∞ anno 1659\\": \\"The history of the pain and death of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with its special learning, reminding, and consoling articles, with prayers and praises, in psalms and songs with misc. notes, compiled and written in the year 1659\\"), a collection of fifty hymns to be sung, one for each working day, during the seven weeks of Lent. Each hymn has a title denoting to which part of the Passion of Christ it refers and a reference to a melody to which it may be sung. Other famous works include Aldarh√°ttur, R√≠mur af Lykla-P√©tri og Magell√≥nu, Kr√≥ka-Refs r√≠mur, and a collection of cautionary children's rhymes.

Dedekind introduced them to express the functional equation of the Dedekind eta function. They have subsequently been much studied in number theory, and have occurred in some problems of topology. Dedekind sums have a large number functional equations; this article lists only a small fraction of these. Dedekind sums were introduced by Richard Dedekind in a commentary on fragment XXVIII of Bernhard Riemann's collected papers.  Definition  Define the sawtooth function (\\\\\\\\!( \\\\, )\\\\\\\\!) : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} as :(\\\\\\\\!(x)\\\\\\\\!)=\\\\begin{cases} x-\\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor - 1/2, &\\\\mbox{if }x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{Z};\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0,&\\\\mbox{if }x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}. \\\\end{cases} We then let :D: Z^2\\\\times Z-\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\to R be defined by :D(a,b;c)=\\\\sum_{n \\\\bmod c} \\\\left( \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\frac{an}{c} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\frac{bn}{c} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\right), the terms on the right being the Dedekind sums. For the case a=1, one often writes :s(b,c) = D(1,b;c). Simple formulae Note that D is symmetric in a and b, and hence :D(a,b;c)=D(b,a;c), and that, by the oddness of (()), :D(‚àía,b;c) = ‚àíD(a,b;c), :D(a,b;‚àíc) = D(a,b;c). By the periodicity of D in its first two arguments, the third argument being the length of the period for both, :D(a,b;c)=D(a+kc,b+lc;c), for all integers k,l. If d is a positive integer, then :D(ad,bd;cd) = dD(a,b;c), :D(ad,bd;c) = D(a,b;c), if (d,c) = 1, :D(ad,b;cd) = D(a,b;c), if (d,b) = 1. There is a proof for the last equality making use of :\\\\sum_{n \\\\bmod c} \\\\left( \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{n+x}{c} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right)= (\\\\\\\\!( x )\\\\\\\\!),\\\\qquad\\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. Furthermore, az = 1 (mod c) implies D(a,b;c) = D(1,bz;c). Alternative forms If b and c are coprime, we may write s(b,c) as :s(b,c)=\\\\frac{-1}{c} \\\\sum_\\\\omega \\\\frac{1} { (1-\\\\omega^b) (1-\\\\omega ) } +\\\\frac{1}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{4c}, where the sum extends over the c-th roots of unity other than 1, i.e. over all \\\\omega such that \\\\omega^c=1 and \\\\omega ot=1. If b, c > 0 are coprime, then :s(b,c)=\\\\frac{1}{4c}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{c-1} \\\\cot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{c} \\\\right) \\\\cot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\pi nb}{c} \\\\right). Reciprocity law If b and c are coprime positive integers then :s(b,c)+s(c,b) =\\\\frac{1}{12}\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{c}+\\\\frac{1}{bc}+\\\\frac{c}{b}\\\\right)-\\\\frac{1}{4}. Rewriting this as :12bc \\\\left( s(b,c) + s(c,b) \\\\right) = b^2 + c^2 -3bc + 1, it follows that the number 6c s(b,c) is an integer. If k = (3, c) then : 12bc\\\\, s(c,b)=0 \\\\mod kc and : 12bc\\\\, s(b,c)=b^2+1 \\\\mod kc. A relation that is prominent in the theory of the Dedekind eta function is the following. Let q = 3, 5, 7 or 13 and let n = 24/(q ‚àí 1). Then given integers a, b, c, d with ad ‚àí bc = 1 (thus belonging to the modular group), with c chosen so that c = kq for some integer k > 0, define :\\\\delta = s(a,c) - \\\\frac{a+d}{12c} - s(a,k) + \\\\frac{a+d}{12k} Then one has nŒ¥ is an even integer. Rademacher's generalization of the reciprocity law Hans Rademacher found the following generalization of the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums: If a,b, and c are pairwise coprime positive integers, then :D(a,b;c)+D(b,c;a)+D(c,a;b)=\\\\frac{1}{12}\\\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{abc}-\\\\frac{1}{4}.

The rockers contact the floor at only two points, giving the occupant the ability to rock back and forth by shifting their weight or pushing lightly with their feet. Rocking chairs are most commonly made of wood. Some rocking chairs can fold. Etymology The word rocking chair comes from the verb to rock. The first known use of the term rocking chair was in 1766. Purpose Swedish painter and furniture designer, Karin Berg√∂√∂ Larsson Rocking chairs are often seen as evocative of parenting, as the gentle rocking motion can soothe infants and send them off to sleep. Many adults find rocking chairs soothing because of the gentle motion. Gentle rocking motion has been shown to provide faster onset of sleep than remaining stationary, mimicking the process of a parent rocking a child to sleep. Rocking chairs are also comfortable because, when a user sits in one without rocking, the chair automatically rocks backward until the sitter's center of gravity is met, thus granting an ergonomic benefit with the occupant kept at an un-stressed position and angle. Varieties of rockers include those mounted on a spring base (or platform) called \\"platform rockers\\" and those with swinging braces commonly known as gliders. History A photo of man lounging in a rocking chair while reading Edvard Munch: Aunt Karen in the Rocking Chair, 1883 Though American inventor Benjamin Franklin is sometimes credited with inventing the rocking chair, historians actually trace the rocking chair's origins to North America during the early 18th century, when Franklin was a child. Originally used in gardens, they were simply ordinary chairs with rockers attached. It was in 1725 that early rocking chairs first appeared in England. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century. These wicker rockers, as they were popularly known, were famous for their craftsmanship and creative designs. Rocking cradles long predate rocking chairs however and an example exists from antiquity, found in the ruins of Herculaneum. Michael Thonet, a German craftsman, created the first bentwood rocking chair in 1860. This design is distinguished by its graceful shape and its light weight. These rocking chairs were influenced by Greek and Roman designs as well as Renaissance and colonial era artistry. During the 1920s, however, folding rocking chairs became more popular in the United States and in Europe. They were handy for outdoor activities and travel purposes. By the 1950s, rocking chairs built by Sam Maloof, an American craftsman, became famous for their durability and deluxe appearance. Maloof's rocking chairs are distinguished by their ski-shaped rockers. The 'Kennedy Rocker' rocking chair  President John F. Kennedy made the P & P Chair Company's rocking chair famous. In 1955, Kennedy, who suffered with chronic back problems, was prescribed swimming and the use of a rocking chair by his physician. The President so enjoyed the rocker that, after he was inaugurated in 1961, he took the chair on Air Force One when he traveled around the country and the world. He bought additional rockers for Camp David and for the Kennedy estates; and he gave them as gifts to friends, family, and heads of state. Kennedy's rocking chair from the White House is on permanent display at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. Per the manufacturing design, the Kennedy Rocking Chair is shaped, steam-bent, and assembled while the wood is still green.

He was an early hotel chain founder known as \\"King of Hoteliers, and Hotelier to Kings,\\" and it is from his name and that of his hotels that the term ritzy derives. Early life Ritz was born in the Swiss village of Niederwald, the youngest of 13 children in a poor peasant family. At the age of twelve he was sent as a boarder to the Jesuit college at Sion, and at fifteen, having shown only vaguely artistic leanings, was apprenticed as a sommelier at a hotel in Brig. While working there as an apprentice wine waiter he was dismissed by the patron of the hotel from his position, saying, \\"You'll never make anything of yourself in the hotel business. It takes a special knack, a special flair, and it's only right that I tell you the truth‚Äîyou haven't got it.\\" He returned briefly to the Jesuits as a sacristan, then left to seek his fortune in Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition. Early career Ritz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870‚Äì71 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, manager, and eventually hotelier. After a short stint working at the Hotel de la Fid√©lit√©, he worked as a waiter in a workman's bistro and took a position in a prix fixe restaurant owned by the Chevallier family, where he was later sacked for breaking too many dishes in his desire to work briskly. He worked his way up from assistant waiter to restaurant manager of a restaurant on the corner of Rue Royale and Rue Saint-Honore, before working at the high-class Restaurant Voisin between 1869 and 1872. Here he waited on the likes of Sarah Bernhardt, George Sand, Edmond de Goncourt, Th√©ophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas, learned the essentials of his trade from the owner, Bellenger, and served up dishes such as elephant's trunk in sauce chasseur as supplies of fresh meat dwindled during the siege and zoo animals took their place. In 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the H√¥tel Splendide in Paris, which was one of the most lavish hotels in Europe at the time, where he met many rich, self-made Americans as guests who had a profound effect on him. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition, by which time he had begun to acquire a considerable knowledge of the industry and the culinary preferences of esteemed people such as the Prince of Wales. First managership In the winter of 1873 his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand H√¥tel in Nice. He once stated that his \\"years of wandering in the wake of a migratory society had begun\\". While working as manager at the Rigi-Kulm Hotel in Switzerland, an incident occurred that changed his career. The central heating at the hotel broke during a frigid day, and a group of 40 were arriving for lunch. Ritz changed the menu to hot dishes, moved a table into the smaller drawing room, and heated 40 bricks in the oven to be wrapped in flannel cloths placed at the footstool of each guest. This quick thinking was noticed by Max Pfyffer, the designer of the Grand Hotel National in Lucerne, who noted his efficiency in a scrapbook. Regular moves then followed, usually twice a year just ahead of the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer. He had a period working as the ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel of the Grand H√¥tel in Locarno on Lake Maggiore, a difficult period given the eccentricities of its alcoholic manager who lived on a diet of raw ham, bread, and wine and had a habit of disturbing the guests, ringing bells at 5am and chasing his wife through the corridors with an army pistol. Ritz meekly commented that \\"I did what I could to pacify the clients\\" in the circumstances. Ritz with wife Marie-Louise in 1888. They had two sons. In 1878, he became the manager of the Grand H√¥tel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand H√¥tel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and quickly gained a reputation for good taste and elegance, and by the mid-1880s the Grand H√¥tel National in Lucerne had earned a reputation as the most elegant hotel in Europe. Ritz was the first to mandate that \\"the customer is always right\\". His code was \\"See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked.\\" According to his widow, Ritz also was a pioneer of hygiene and cleanliness in his hotels. He decorated without heavy draperies and wallpaper and replaced them with washable paint and lighter washable fabrics. In 1887 Ritz bought the Hotel de Provence in Cannes and the Restaurant de la Conversation and Minerva Hotel in Baden-Baden. Ritz and Escoffier In 1888, he opened the Conservations Haus restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as \\"a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London\\". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele headed by the Prince of Wales, including the British and European royal families. According to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin, \\"the outstanding success of the Savoy owed everything to the civilized genius of C√©sar Ritz and his brilliant chef, Auguste Escoffier, who introduced the English to the subtlety and delicacy of French haute cuisine and invented at the Savoy many celebrated dishes, including Peche Melba and the thin toast named after the same singer\\". Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now \\"seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms.\\" Ritz campaigned with Henry Labouch√®re, Lord Randolph Churchill, and others to \\"alter licensing laws whereby restaurants could not open on Sundays and had to close at 11pm on other nights.\\" In March 1898, Ritz was sacked from the Savoy for fraud. He was implicated in the disappearance of more than ¬£3,400 of wine and spirits, as well as in receiving kickbacks from suppliers.Levy, Paul. \\"The master chef who cooked the books\\" , The Daily Telegraph, 9 June 2012 In a 1938 biography of her husband, Ritz's widow maintained that he resigned. In fact, however, after a damning report by the Savoy's auditors, Carte handed Ritz, Escoffier, and Ritz's deputy, Louis Echenard, letters of dismissal. Ritz threatened to sue the hotel company for wrongful dismissal, but he was evidently dissuaded by Escoffier, who felt that their interests would be better served by keeping the scandal quiet.\\"Savoy's epic scandal\\", The Observer, 19 May 1985, p. 2 Lady de Grey sided with Ritz; she cancelled her party at the Savoy on learning of his sacking, stating \\"Where Ritz goes, I go\\". Ritz subsequently established a Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, built in 1897‚Äì99 under the designs of C.J. Phipps. Bombed in World War II, the hotel was later replaced by New Zealand House in 1959. Ritz hotels Ritz would go on to find investors and open a number of his own hotels. By the late 1890s, Ritz was an extremely busy man, with hotel enterprises in Rome, Frankfurt, Salsomaggiore, Palermo, Biarritz, Wiesbaden, Monte Carlo, Lucerne and Menton and projects in Madrid, Cairo and Johannesburg. According to his wife, \\"C√©sar's suitcases were never completely unpacked; he was always either just arriving from or departing upon a new journey\\". In 1896, he formed the Ritz Hotel syndicate with South African millionaire Alfred Beit, reputedly the wealthiest man in the world at the time. They opened what would become the celebrated H√¥tel Ritz in the Place Vend√¥me, Paris, late in 1898. At the inauguration, on 1 June 1898, were many figures of the European elite, including Lady de Grey, the Duke and Duchess de Rohan, Calouste Gulbenkian, and Marcel Proust. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1905, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era for the rich and famous. The Ritz Hotel in Madrid, opened in 1906, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the now-famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health. Later life The hotelier himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911. By 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake K√ºssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at K√ºssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, C√©sar Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.

He distinguished himself in battle against the Ottoman Turks in the service of the Emperor Rudolf II, and was created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. His assumption of the title displeased Queen Elizabeth, who refused to recognize it, and imprisoned him in the Fleet Prison. In 1605 Arundell was created 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour. In the same year he was briefly suspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot. Life Sir Thomas Arundell (c. 15607 November 1639) was the eldest son of Sir Matthew Arundell of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (ca. 1532/1534 ‚Äì 24 December 1598), a member of the ancient family of Arundell of Cornwall, and Margaret Willoughby, the daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby, of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, and wife Margaret Markham. His father inherited extensive former monastic lands, and served in a number of administrative capacities, including high sheriff, custos rotulorum, and Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset. In her youth his mother served for several years in the household of Princess Elizabeth at Hatfield.. Arundell's paternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Arundell (executed on 26 February 1552) and Margaret Howard (ca. 1515 ‚Äì 10 October 1571), sister of Queen Catherine Howard.. In 1580 Arundell was imprisoned for his fervent Roman Catholicism.; .

Arundell's wife was the sister of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Arundell was fond of Southampton as a youth, writing to Lord Burghley when Southampton was 15 that 'Your Lordship doth love him', and that 'My [own] love and care of this young Earl enticeth me'.. Although a Roman Catholic throughout his life, Arundell demonstrated his loyalty to the Crown in 1588 by subscribing ¬£100 towards the defeat of the Spanish Armada.; . According to Akrigg, Arundell was 'gifted and scholarly', but by the time he had reached his 30s had failed to find any outlet for his talents and had 'sunk into a melancholic existence', living a 'studious solitary life' at the Wriothesley estates in Hampshire or in the family apartments at Southampton House in London. In 1595 Arundell's father agreed to provide him with horses and ¬£1100 to leave England and serve in the Imperial forces against the Turks.. The Queen allegedly recommended him to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II.. On 7 September 1595 Arundell stormed the breach at Gran, replacing the Turkish standard with the Imperial eagle.. In recognition of his service, Arundell was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire on 14 December 1595, and became known as 'the Valiant'.; . Against his father's wishes Arundell took his leave of the Imperial court in mid-December and returned to England. His ship was caught in a storm and wrecked near Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast. He lost all his belongings in the wreck, and counted himself fortunate to stand 'extreamely cold & wett upon the shore'.. His assumption of a foreign title created jealousy among his fellow peers in England, and was resented by his father, who objected to his superior rank and disinherited him. The Queen was furious, and threatened to make him renounce the title. She committed Arundell to the Fleet Prison, remarking that 'I would not have a sheep branded with another man's mark'.; . Arundell remained under arrest till mid-April 1597, when he was freed, but forbidden to appear at court. In the following months he made frequent appeals to the Queen, but was still denied her favour, and again fell prey to depression. In July his father grudgingly allowed Arundell to live with him at Wardour provided that he not bring his wife with him.. In 1597 Arundell was arrested on vague suspicions of Catholic espionage. The authorities searched his chamber but could prove nothing against him, and released him to his father's custody on the grounds of his wife's failing health. Arundell's father 'insisted on behaving as a jailer', and Arundell was eventually transferred elsewhere.. Arundell succeeded his father in December 1598. In 1601, his brother-in-law, Southampton, was on trial for his part in the Essex Rebellion of 8 February 1601. Attempting to distance himself from Southampton's misfortune, Arundell wrote a 'treacherous' letter on 18 February to Sir Robert Cecil, protesting that Southampton's 'ears were hardened against wholesome counsel, for which I thought good to estrange myself from him'.. In March 1605 Arundell and Southampton sent Captain George Weymouth to found a colony in Virginia. The colonists arrived back in England in mid-July. According to the account written by James Rosier, these were the colonists 'we were to leave in the Country by their agreement with my Lord the Right Honourable Count Arundell'. According to Akrigg, Arundell figures much more prominently in Rosier's account than Southampton, leading Akrigg to conclude that 'the whole voyage may best be regarded as a first attempt to found an American colony that would be an asylum for English Catholics', and that Arundell, who in 1596 had planned a venture to the East Indies, was the principal impetus behind the Weymouth voyage.. On 4 May 1605 King James I created him Baron Arundell of Wardour.; . Appointed by the new King as colonel of the English regiment serving the Archduke in Spanish Flanders,. Arundell made an unauthorized crossing to the continent in September 1605, disobeying royal orders and incurring the King's anger.; . A few months later he was named by Guy Fawkes under torture, and briefly suspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot.. In 1607 Arundell's eldest son and heir, Thomas, married Blanche Somerset, the daughter of the Earl of Worcester, without Arundell's consent, resulting in an estrangement between father and son. Arundell's first wife, Mary, died a few weeks after the marriage.. On 1 July 1608 Arundell remarried. His second wife was Anne Philipson, the daughter of Miles Philipson, of Crook, Westmorland, and Barbara Sandys, sister of Francis Sandys, of Conishead, Lancashire. She died on 28 June 1637 at Lennox House in London, and was buried on 4 July 1637 at Tisbury, Wiltshire.; . During the 1630s Arundell engaged in 'acrimonious religious disputes' with the Bishop of Durham, and in 1637 attempted to sell Wardour Castle to the King.. He died at Wardour on 7 November 1639, and was buried at Tisbury.; ; . Marriages and issue Arundell married firstly Mary Wriothesley, by whom he had two sons and a daughter:. #Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour (c. 1586‚Äì 19 May 1643), who succeeded him. #William Arundell of Horningsham, Wiltshire, who married Mary Browne, eldest daughter of Anthony Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montague (d.1629), by Jane Sackville, daughter of Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset.

Harry Wright Newman, p. 241.

Since the 1970s he has taught at the Universit√© Nationale du B√©nin in Cotonou, where he is Professor of Philosophy. In the early 1990s he briefly served as Minister of Education and Minister for Culture and Communications in the Government of Benin. Education and career Paulin J. Hountondji was educated at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris, graduating in 1966, and taking his doctorate in 1970 (his thesis was on Edmund Husserl). After two years teaching in Besan√ßon (France), in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi (Democratic Republic of the Congo), he accepted a post at the Universit√© Nationale du B√©nin in Cotonou, where he still teaches as Professor of Philosophy. His academic career was interrupted, however, by a period spent in politics. Having been a prominent critic of the military dictatorship that had ruled his country, Hountondji became involved in Benin's return to democracy (in 1992), and served in the government as Minister of Education and Minister for Culture and Communications until his resignation and return to the University in 1994. He is currently director of the African Centre for Advanced Studies in Porto-Novo, Benin, and served as the Bingham Professor of Humanities from 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008 at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.Department of Philosophy, University of Louisville In 1999, Hountondji was honoured with a Prince Claus Award from the Prince Claus Fund, an international culture and development organisation based in Amsterdam. Philosophical work Hountondji's philosophical influences include two of his teachers in Paris, Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida. His reputation rests primarily on his critical work concerning the nature of African philosophy. His main target has been the ethnophilosophy of writers such as Placide Tempels and Alexis Kagame. He argues that such an approach confuses the methods of anthropology with those of philosophy, producing \\"a hybrid discipline without a recognizable status in the world of theory\\" ([1997], p. 52). Part of the problem stems from the fact that ethnophilosophy is in large part a response to Western views of African thought; this polemical role works against its philosophical validity. His approach has widened somewhat in later work; he still rejects ethnophilosophy as a genuine philosophical discipline, but he has moved towards more of a synthesis of traditional African thought and rigorous philosophical method.

The fluid is usually a clear or milky white color that may contain sperm. It can vary in size from several millimeters to many centimeters. Small spermatoceles are relatively common, occurring in an estimated 30 percent of all men. They are generally not painful. However, some people may experience discomfort such as a dull pain in the scrotum from larger spermatoceles. They are not cancerous, nor do they cause an increased risk of testicular cancer. Additionally, unlike varicoceles, they do not reduce fertility. Causes Spermatoceles can originate as diverticulum from the tubules found in the head of the epididymis. Sperm accumulation gradually causes the diverticulum to increase in size, causing a spermatocele. They are due to continuity between the epididymis and tunica vaginalis. They are also believed to result from epididymitis, physical trauma, or vasectomy. Scarring of any part of the epididymis can cause it to become obstructed and in turn form a spermatocele. Diagnosis Micrograph of a spermatocele. The characteristic sperm are present (black dots - left of image). H&E; stain.Dilated rete testis containing spermatozoa within cyst lumen. H&E; stain 20x Spermatoceles can be discovered as incidental scrotal masses found on physical examination by a physician or by self-inspection of the scrotum and testicles. Finding a painless, cystic mass at the head of the epididymis that is clearly separate from the testicle can indicate a spermatocele. Shining a light through the mass through a process known as transillumination can also help differentiate between a fluid-filled cyst and a tumor, which would not allow as much light to pass. If uncertainty exists, ultrasonography of the scrotum can confirm the presence of a spermatocele. Treatment Small cysts as well as asymptomatic larger cysts are better left alone and carefully observed. However, treatment can be considered if the cysts are causing discomfort/pain, enlarging in size, or per patient request. There are a few different treatment options, ranging in levels of invasiveness. Certain drugs can be taken by mouth to decrease spermatocele-related symptoms such as pain and/or swelling. Aspiration and sclerotherapy are treatments that remove fluid from the spermatocele and seal the spermatocele sac closed from further fluid build-up, respectively. Due to a higher risk of epididymis damage, fertility problems, and further recurrences, these procedures are not recommended and not commonly used. The last option is to surgically remove the spermatocele entirely with a spermatocelectomy. This standard procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting with the use of local or general anesthesia. Depending on the spermatocele, parts of the epididymis may also be removed. After surgical removal, it is possible that the pain will persist. There is also still a risk for recurrence and fertility problems.

Traditionally it denotes the second-lowest rank within the nobility, standing above \\"Edler\\" and below \\"Freiherr\\" (Baron). For its historical association with warfare and the landed gentry in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of \\"Knight\\", but is hereditary so is closer to the British title of \\"Baronet\\". As with most titles and designations within the nobility in German-speaking areas, the rank was hereditary and generally was used with the nobiliary particle of von or zu before a family name. The wife of a Ritter was called a \\"Frau\\" (in this sense \\"Lady\\") and not Ritterin. In the Austrian Empire the title of \\"Ritter von\\" was bestowed upon citizens who deserved more than the plain \\"von\\" but were not considered deserving enough as to be given a barony as \\"Freiherr\\". In addition to the described system, W√ºrttemberg introduced orders of merit beginning in the late 18th century which also conferred nobility as \\"Ritter von\\" but kept the title limited to the recipient's lifetime (see Military Order of Max Joseph).

Intended for teen-aged readers, the novel's themes include apprenticeship, courtship, sacrifice, human rights, and the growing tension between Patriots and Loyalists as conflict nears. Events depicted in the novel include the Boston Tea Party, the British blockade of the Port of Boston, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The book won the 1944 Newbery Medal and is the 16th bestselling children's book as of the year 2000 in the United States, according to Publishers Weekly.Infoplease In 1957, Walt Disney Pictures released a film adaptation, also called Johnny Tremain. Plot summary The story begins on July 23, 1773, in the Boston silversmith shop of elderly Ephraim Lapham, where Johnny is a promising 14-year-old apprentice. It is understood that someday he will marry Mr. Lapham's granddaughter Cilla to keep the shop within the Lapham family. The shop soon receives a challenging and urgent order from wealthy merchant John Hancock to make a silver dish to replace one that Mr. Lapham fashioned decades before. While preparing Hancock's order, Johnny's hand is badly burned when Dove, an older apprentice resentful of Johnny, deliberately gives him a cracked crucible that leaks molten silver. Johnny's hand is crippled beyond use, and he can no longer be a silversmith. Johnny's youthful pride is crushed by the injury, which has made him useful only as an unskilled errand boy. He goes off to find a new job that will accept his crippled hand. After a series of rejections, Johnny reaches the low point of his young life. While searching for jobs, he encounters in a printshop a young typesetter named Rab Silsbee, who is friendly to him. He then decides to turn to Mr. Lyte, a wealthy Boston merchant. Johnny explains that his mother told him that he and Mr. Lyte are related and as a last resort, to turn to him for help. Lyte requests the proof, and Johnny shows him a silver cup with the Lyte family's crest. Lyte says it was stolen from him in a burglary, and Johnny is arrested because it was believed that he had stolen it. Eventually, Johnny is freed by the court after Rab brings Cilla to court and she testifies that he showed her his cup before the burglary ever took place. Johnny settles into a job delivering a weekly newspaper, the Boston Observer. The Observer is a Whig publication, and Johnny is introduced to the larger world of pre-revolutionary Boston politics by his new friend Rab. Johnny learns to ride and care for Goblin, a beautiful but skittish horse used to make deliveries, and moves in with Rab in the attic of the newspaper's shop. As months go by and tension between Whigs and Tories rises, Johnny becomes a dedicated Whig himself. Johnny matures and re-evaluates many personal relationships, including that with Cilla, who becomes a trusted friend and fellow Whig. Johnny and Rab take part in the Boston Tea Party, in which Boston patriots throw a shipload of tea into the harbor rather than allow the ship's owner to unload the tea and pay a tax imposed by Parliament without the consent of the people of Britain's American colonies. In retaliation Britain sends an army to occupy Boston and closes the port, inflicting hardship upon the inhabitants of this commercial and trading town. Johnny acts as a spy for the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization of Boston Whigs fomenting resistance to Britain when in addition to his newspaper deliveries, he is paid by British officers to carry their letters to outlying towns. He becomes a trusted member working with prominent Whig leaders John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere and Doctor Joseph Warren. Rab is also a member and drills with the Minutemen at Lexington, but he frets at not having a modern musket with which to fight. Johnny, unable to fight because of his hand, obtains a musket for Rab by helping a British soldier to desert. However, he is badly disturbed when the deserter is caught and executed. The novel reaches its climax in April 1775 with the outbreak and immediate aftermath of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Prior to the battle, the leading Whig leaders convene in the attic where Johnny and Rab sleep. James Otis Jr., once an active member but recently shunned by the group due to his recurrent bouts of insanity, comes to the meeting uninvited. Otis, quite sane on this night, stands hunched under the sloped beams of the Observer's attic and explains to those present what the impending fight with the British is really about: \\"We give all we have . . . even life itself‚Äîonly that a man can stand up.\\" Although the beginning of the war has brought about the death of Rab, the scorned American militia have defeated the powerful British army in their first battle. Johnny submits to an operation by Doctor Warren that will repair his hand and allow him to take up Rab's musket. Characters The novel features both fictional and historical characters. Johnny Tremain: The story's protagonist. Born Jonathan Lyte Tremain, he is a likable but cocky young teenager, a talented apprentice silversmith indentured at the age of 12 to Ephraim Lapham for seven years. Because his right hand is badly injured by molten silver, he is forced to seek another trade. Mrs. Lapham decides that, despite Ephraim's promise to never turn him out, he can no longer live with them because he is a drain on their meager resources and his hand renders him useless to support the family. Johnny was born in a convent in France. He returned with his mother Lavinia \\"Vinny\\" Lyte Tremain to Townsend, Maine, when she was certain she would no longer be recognized as a Lyte. Rab Silsbee: Johnny's first true friend and role model. He is two years older than Johnny, taller, more mature, resourceful, brave, and admired, especially by Johnny. He does not mind Johnny's crippled hand. He introduces Johnny to the politics of Boston, where he is a member of the Sons of Liberty. He treats Cilla kindly, but mostly to tease Johnny. Rab is a Silsbee, known for their dignified aloof reserve, but a fervent, well-spoken Patriot. Rab drills with the Minutemen of Lexington using an old fowling-piece, but yearns for a modern musket. He takes part in the Battle of Lexington where he is mortally wounded. Priscilla \\"Cilla\\" Lapham: Priscilla Lapham is slightly younger than Johnny. Unlike her older sisters, she is petite and a blossoming beauty. Before Johnny‚Äôs accident, it is arranged that she and Johnny will marry. Over time, Cilla and Johnny develop a genuine love for each other. Cilla is intended to wed Mr. Tweedie after her older sisters both refuse, but she too balks and goes to work for the Lytes. She is Mrs. Lapham's third daughter. Isannah \\"Izzy\\" Lapham: The youngest daughter of Mrs. Lapham, Isannah is a beautiful but frail child of nine who needs close caring for at all times. Once-sweet Isannah is beloved by her older sister, Cilla, but eventually becomes selfish and vain, with a reputation for parroting other‚Äôs words and not being an independent thinker. Isannah's golden-haired, brown- eyed beauty attracts a great deal of attention, most significantly from Lavinia Lyte. Lavinia takes Isannah as her protege and introduces her to high society, separating her from her family and their working-class way of life. Ephraim Lapham: A British silversmith, and Johnny's master at the beginning of the novel. Mr. Lapham is pious and kind, but old, frail, and no longer the master smith of his youth and unfortunately dies soon after Johnny leaves his apprenticeship. Mr. Percival Tweedie: A 40-year-old from Baltimore, Maryland who becomes Mr. Lapham's business partner after Johnny's accident. Mr. Tweedie is a \\"queer\\" man, unliked by many. Johnny calls him a \\"Squeak-Pig\\". Mrs. Lapham, later Mrs. Tweedie: Ephraim Lapham's widowed daughter-in-law. Mrs. Lapham is a dedicated, hardworking mother and a no-nonsense taskmaster to the apprentices. She works as the housekeeper in Mr. Lapham's house and shop. When none of her daughters will do so, she marries Mr. Tweedie to keep the silversmith shop in the Lapham family. Dorcas Lapham: Mrs. Lapham's second daughter. Although the stocky Dorcas longs to be elegant and sophisticated, she falls in love with the poverty-stricken Frizel, Jr., and elopes to avoid marrying Mr. Tweedie. Madge Lapham: Mrs. Lapham's oldest daughter. Like Mrs. Lapham, Madge is tough and capable. She falls in love and elopes with Sergeant Gale, a British soldier. Madge, like Dorcas, was engaged to marry Mr. Tweedie and elopes with Sergeant Gale to avoid marrying him. Dove: An apprentice in the Lapham shop and rival of Johnny whose first name had been forgotten. He is older than Johnny, stupid and given to malicious behavior, and has been an apprentice two years longer but still can only perform menial duties. Dove both resents and looks up to Johnny. He attempts to steal tea during the Boston Tea Party. After Mr. Lapham dies, Dove takes a job caring for British officers' horses during Boston's occupation. Johnny despises Dove and cannot bring himself to forgive him as Mr. Lapham counseled, but his thirst for revenge dies when Dove is persistently abused by his Redcoat masters. Dusty Miller: Mr. Lapham's youngest apprentice. Before Johnny's accident, Dusty idolized him. After Johnny leaves the silversmith shop, Dusty runs away to sea. Mr. Lorne: Rab's master and uncle by marriage. Mr. Lorne owns the print shop that publishes the Boston Observer, a seditious Whig (Patriot) newspaper. Mrs. Jenifer Lorne: Mr. Lorne's wife and Rab's aunt. Mrs. Lorne sees through Johnny's arrogant exterior to treat him as a lonely boy. She becomes like a mother to him and is the mother of an infant son who is unmistakably a Silsbee. Johnny nicknames him \\"Rabbit\\", as a word play on Rab's name. Jonathan Lyte: A wealthy Boston merchant and Johnny's great-uncle.

Reception Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"This is delightful reading, but at the close it seems to leave less sense of substance and permanence than her best work (Paradise and Paul Revere), but to me it was more satisfying than The General's Lady or Mirror for Witches.\\" Common Sense Media said that \\"this sweeping tale of redcoats and revolutionaries has a lot to offer\\" and remarked, \\"Forbes, a historian, writes with detail and precision, imbuing historical events with life and passion that is often lacking in textbooks.\\" Similar characters in other media Another Johnny Tremaine (note the different spelling of the surname) was a different fictional character played by Rod Cameron in the 1949 Republic Pictures film Brimstone, written by Thames Williamson and Norman S. Hall. This second Tremaine was a U.S. Marshal who goes undercover to stop a cattle-smuggling ring. The release of Brimstone followed the awarding of the Newbery prize to the novel Johnny Tremain, but preceded the release of the 1957 film Johnny Tremain by Disney.

Name In a break with tradition, the name of the princess was chosen by her parents, instead of by the Emperor. It was selected from clause 56 of Li Lou II, one of the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius.

In early March 2010, Aiko began to stay home from school due to not getting along with other children and being bullied by her elementary school classmates. Aiko returned to school on a limited basis on 2 May 2010. After returning to school, a senior palace official said that she would attend a limited number of classes accompanied by her mother, upon advice from a doctor at the Crown Prince's household. In November 2011, Aiko was hospitalized with pneumonia. In 2014, she enrolled at the Gakushuin Girl's Junior High-school. In the summer of 2018, she made her first solo trip abroad to attend a summer program at Eton College. After her return, she confidently answered questions from the press and took on the role of emcee for her school's dance team performance. Reports from an unnamed palace source close to the family reported that Aiko provides her mother Masako with emotional support in her new role as Empress. In February 2020 she was accepted at Gakushuin University where she is to major in Japanese language and literature. Public life She visited a special exhibition on the 150th anniversary of Japan‚ÄìItaly diplomatic relations on 5 April 2016 at the Tokyo museum. Since turning 16, she has accompanied her parents at public appearances. Princess Aiko was ineligible to attend any of her father's ascension ceremonies in person as she is still a minor. According to Imperial Household Law, Article 22, she will reach the age of maturity on her twentieth birthday in 2021. Succession to the throne Princess Aiko (standing, center) with the Imperial Family (November 2013) The Imperial Household Law of 1947 abolished the Japanese nobility; under provisions of this law, the imperial family was streamlined to the descendants of Emperor Taish≈ç.\\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\\" The Japan Times. 27 March 2007. The laws of succession in Japan prevent inheritance by or through the female line. Debate The birth of Princess Aiko sparked debate in Japan about whether the Imperial Household Law of 1947 should be changed from the current system of agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman, as firstborn, to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne ahead of a younger brother or male cousin. Although Imperial chronologies include eight empresses regnant in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Though Empress Genmei was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh≈ç,Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 56. Gensh≈ç herself was succeeded by her brother's son, thus keeping the throne in the same agnatic line; both Gensh≈ç and Genmei, as well as all other empresses regnant and emperors, belonged to the same patriline. A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial succession law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the Diet letting women ascend to the throne in order that the Imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 government panel. Birth of male cousin Proposals to replace agnatic primogeniture were shelved temporarily after it was announced in February 2006 that the-then Crown Prince's younger brother, Fumihito, Prince Akishino, and his wife, Kiko, Princess Akishino, were expecting their third child. On 6 September 2006, Princess Kiko gave birth to a son, Hisahito, who was third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne at the time of the birth under the current law, after his uncle, the then-Crown Prince, and his father, Prince Akishino.. The prince's birth provided the first male heir to be born in the imperial family in 41 years. On 3 January 2007, Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the Imperial Household Law. Therefore, at this time, it seems unlikely that the succession laws will be changed to allow Princess Aiko to ascend the throne.

Elder Silanus  Silanus (died 49), was the third born son to Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the Junii Silani, a family of Ancient Rome. His maternal grandparents were Julia the Younger, granddaughter of Augustus, and consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Through his maternal grandparents he was a descendant of the Roman Emperor Augustus, the noble woman Scribonia, the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and the consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). He won an honorary triumph and gave a lavish gladiatorial display. He was praetor in 48. The Emperor Claudius betrothed him to his daughter Claudia Octavia, but this was broken off (also in 48) when the Empress Agrippina the Younger, hoping to secure Octavia as bride for her son Nero and also to eliminate a potential threat to Nero's prospects, falsely charged him with open affection toward his sister Junia Calvina. This was carried out through the agency of Lucius Vitellius, who was Junia's husband. Consequently Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office. He was forced to commit suicide on New Year's Day, 49, the same day that Claudius and Agrippina married.  Younger Silanus  Silanus (50-66) was the son of the elder's brother, Marcus. His mother is unknown. After his father's murder, he was raised by his paternal aunt Junia Lepida and her husband Gaius Cassius Longinus. A respected young nobleman, he became a rival in his youth to Emperor Nero. Expelled from public life by Nero after his accession to the purple, Silanus was banished to the small country town of Bari (Roman Barium in Apulia). Ordered to commit suicide, he chose to fight, and was killed in a standoff with his guards.

Established by an act of Congress on September 7, 1916, it was named after Ahsiniiwin (Stone Child , incorrectly originally translated as Rocky Boy), the chief of the Chippewa band, who had died a few months earlier. It was established for landless Chippewa (Ojibwe) Indians in the American West, but within a short period of time many Cree (Nƒìhiyaw) and M√©tis were also settled there. Today the Cree outnumber the Chippewa on the reservation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) recognizes it (and the tribe) as the Chippewa Cree Reservation. The reservation is located in Hill and Chouteau counties in north central Montana, about from the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border. It has a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The reservation is reported to have 3,323 enrolled members, 55% of the total 6,177 enrolled members in the tribe. Description The reservation was established by congressional statute on September 7, 1916 (39 Stat. 739, Sec. 10), to provide land for the Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians, who had been forced out of territory in Minnesota and were landless. The Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation is located in the Bears Paw Mountains in north central Montana. According to the map of Montana, the reservation takes in land within the boundaries of Hill and Chouteau counties, about south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. It is the smallest reservation in the state in terms of land area, with a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The population was 3,323 at the 2010 census, an increase of 24 percent compared to 2000. Three other reservations of the seven in the state also had population growth during this period. The Bureau of Indian Affairs' Labor Force Report of 2005 reported 5,656 enrolled members in the tribe. The largest community of the reservation is Box Elder, although a small part of Box Elder extends off reservation lands. More than 80% of the tribal enrolled members are classifiable as \\"adoptees\\" under the tribal constitution, as they have non- Chippewa tribal origin. Rocky Boy's unusual name was derived from the English mistranslation of the name of the tribal chief, Ahsiniiwin (in the Chippewa/Anishanaabe language). His name was closer in meaning to \\"Stone Child\\". The Chippewa who are descendants of Chief Rocky Boy say his name is Asiniweyin, meaning \\"Stone Being\\", or \\"Being of Stone\\". The Department of Interior refers to the Chippewa-Cree Tribe as being the recognized tribe on the reservation, but this is a term of convenience. The Chippewa and Cree peoples are distinct tribes among the several that are part of the larger Anishinaabe family. History Chief Rocky Boy wrote to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and later to President Theodore Roosevelt on January 14, 1902, asking the U.S. government for land, housing, and education for his band of Chippewa Indians, made up of 130 men, women and children. They had been forced out of areas to the east and were landless. Also among landless Indians in Montana were a band of Cree. Chief Ahsiniiwin (Rocky Boy) Chief Rocky Boy (Ahsiniiwin) worked with Republican Senator Joseph M. Dixon, writer Frank Bird Linderman, and other influential individuals in Montana, including painter Charles Russell, to achieve his goal. He lived mainly in north central Montana, although he also traveled to southwestern and western areas of the state. The Rocky Boy Band was listed at 75 in a 1908 census that was certified by the Department of the Interior. Another 39 were listed separately as affiliated persons but not Chippewa, by agent Thralls B. Wheat, who was responsible for land allotments. In 1908, Montana passed the Land Acts, regulating Native American lands. The Swan Valley Massacre of 1908 in the northwest part of the state aroused outrage among Native Americans. A small Pend d'Oreilles hunting party, which included women and elders, was attacked by state officials while they were hunting off reservation in their traditional territory. This right was protected by treaties with the US government, but the state thought they had the power to regulate it. An armed game warden confronted the party when he thought they had not moved out of their camp quickly enough, and shot at members. Gunfire was exchanged, and a total of four Pend d'Oreille were killed in the incident, as was the game warden.Theresa DeLeane O'Nell, Disciplined Hearts: History, Identity, and Depression in an American Indian Community (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996)\\"We will never forget\\", Daily Inter Lake In November 1909, over 100 landless Chippewa-Cree from southwestern and western Montana and northern Idaho (including the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation) gathered near Helena to be relocated to a new homeland on the Blackfeet Reservation, which was closer to their traditional home. With the new Chippewa-Cree Reservation approved and set aside, the government redirected the Chippewa- Cree to the Chippewa band's new home. The new reservation was located between St. Mary, Babb (which is on the Blackfeet Reservation), and the Canada‚ÄìUS border. It was first called the Babb Reservation. Chief Little Bear soon followed Rocky Boy with his own band, arriving with about 200 Cree from Canada after the North-West Rebellion. According to knowledgeable Blackfeet, the name plates are still discernible, showing the effort to relocate the Chippewa there. Anishinaabe leaders feared they would lose the land and forced the Chippewa away, as they were not Blackfeet people and were not entitled to allotments. The US Army had allowed the Chippewa and other landless Indians, including Cree refugees, to settle at Fort Assinniboine in Hill County. By 1912-1913 nearly 600 Chippewa and Cree were living on the large Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation. The Rocky Boy Reservation, which was formed in part by land ceded by the Army from Fort Assinniboine. Most of those settled in the area were Cree refugees from Canada in the U.S. under terms of asylum. Rocky Boy had already supervised his Chippewa band census in 1908 and had it certified by the Interior Department. Chief Rocky Boy was living on the new Chippewa Reservation near Babb, Montana with 50 to 60 people. He negotiated with the US Indian agent for additional lands, which were approved in 1916. Soon after the reservation was officially established, Chippewa and other landless Indians, to include the Cree from north central Montana, western Montana, and northern Idaho, settled alongside those already living on the new Rocky Boy Reservation. With Frank Linderman leading many of the European-American supporters, the US Congress passed legislation in 1916 to establish what was first called Rocky Boy's Reservation. The Indian Inspector Frank Churchill was sent to Montana to negotiate with the chief. Ahsiniiwin educated Churchill about the Chippewa, saying that they lived all around Montana, including at the Blackfeet and Flathead reservations, as well as near many cities dominated by European Americans, including Anaconda, Billings, Butte, Deer Lodge, Great Falls, Havre, Helena, Missoula, Wolf Point and others. Ahsiniiwin asserted that he was peaceful at all times, and he spoke only for the Chippewa people. He had worked to establish Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and signed the 1889 Red Lake Agreement in Minnesota. Churchill asked the Department of Interior to withdraw all of Valley County from white settlement in order to establish a new closed Chippewa reservation there. Both requests were granted by the Department of Interior. In the end, many of the Chippewa-Cree who lived in western Montana were not willing to relocate to far northeastern Montana. Chippewa notation: The Sharrock report/addendum to the official Ewers Report notes the 1908 land was proposed for \\"Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians\\". Chippewa notation : According to the papers of Indian agent Frank Bird Linderman (1869-1938),\\"Frank B. Linderman Memorial Collection, 1885-2005\\", University of Montana Chief Rocky Boy died at Ft. Assiniboine on April 18, 1916. Contemporary newspapers also reported that Rocky Boy died in Fort Assiniboine. But Robert Gopher (Blackfeet), an oral historian of the Chippewa, says that Rocky Boy was assassinated by rival Cree who used poison roots. They were anxious to settle at the reservation. According to the oral traditions of the Saskatchewan Cree, Little Bear was known to use a specific poisonous root to kill political rivals. If the assassination account is true, it threatened the Cree settlement at Rocky Boy Reservation. Linderman supposedly said that rocky Boy in his last words said he did not want to accept the Cree on the newly established reservation. But they had already been occupying land in the area and at Fort Assiniboine. In 1917 a census was conducted at Rocky Boy Reservation in order to establish a tribal roll for what became known as the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Chippewa notation: James McLaughlin, the Interior Agent who entered errors on the 1917 tribal roll, is the same agent who sold Rocky Boy's land in Thief River, Minnesota. The proceeds of that sale were distributed to the Chippewa people of Red Lake, who were established on a reservation of that name.  Chippewa dispute so-called Chippewa Cree tribe  In the 21st century, the Chippewa of Rocky Boy Indian Reservation dispute the claims of the so-called Chippewa Cree tribe, as such a tribe has never existed in fact or in law. By contrast, the U.S. has had extensive treaty relations with the Chippewa people dating from the late 1700s. Chief Rocky Boy was a signor of the 1889 Red Lake Agreement. The non-Chippewa in Rocky Boy are there on the basis of claiming adoptee status. Some Chippewa believe they intended to gain control of tribal resources after passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, when the Chippewa reorganized as a tribe. No verifiable documentation confirms that the tribe's clans and families adopted such a great number of adoptees in earlier years, which is the only way they could have become full members of the tribe. Ethnologist John C. Ewers has never found documentation to show that the Department of Interior formalized the \\"adoptee\\" status of the Cree and M√©tis who settled on the reservation. The Chippewa do not believe the arrangement between those other peoples and the Department of Interior provides sufficient authority to establish them as a tribe. Federal doctrine has respected the recognized tribe as the sovereign authority to make laws to determine citizenship, as a function of self- government. The Chippewa elected their own council and voted to force an audit of the tribal roll. In 2008, The History of the Chippewa and Cree of Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (available online) was published by Stone Child College. Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Council In late 2014, Glenn Gopher, an oral historian and enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe, of Great Falls, Duncan Standing Rock, Sr., and Rocky Boy, Jr. Slimjohn (Deceased: 02/16/2017), of White Swan, Washington, oversaw the effort of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa to assert their sovereignty in a historic return to self-government. Former members of the Business Committee had committed extensive embezzlement and were convicted of theft. The Chippewa people asserted that their sovereignty had been thwarted by extensive mismanagement by the Department of the Interior since historic times.Letter to Darryl LaCounte, Billings Area Director The Chippewa have begun extensive efforts to reach out to the Billings Area office of the BIA to restore self-government. Under the Obama Administration's new Guardians Project, administered by the Department of Interior,, there had been increased enforcement through investigation and prosecution of crimes. The convictions of the Adoptee Business Committee resulted from such prosecution. The Chippewa people never approved the constitution as passed by the Business Committee. The constitution does not provide for specific Chippewa representation in the tribal electoral system. Chippewa are outnumbered on their own reservation by a 10:1 ratio. This threatens the political integrity of the band, and the Chippewa people are working to address it. intend to address. The Chippewa people are working to address enrollment and voting abuses on the reservation. Most recently, Fr. Pete Guthneck, a non-Indian honorary tribal member, voted in the tribal election, thereby invalidating the election. His standing was challenged by Jonathan Windy Boy, an adoptee who is not a direct descendant of the tribe. The Chippewa will enforce their right to conduct an audit after pervasive abuse of the tribal enrollment system, and the presence of outright fraud on the part of the Business Committee and the Interior agency who have colluded to strip the Chippewa people of sovereignty. The interim council consists of blood descendants of the Blackfeet Tribe, Browning, Montana, and of the original Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians, who will audit the largely adoptee roll. The proposed interim council consists of Glenn Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; Duncan Standing Rock, Jr., Chippewa Cree Tribe; Blair Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; Delores Chippewa, Chippewa-Cree Tribe; Nora Nelson, Chippewa Cree Tribe; Barbara Standing Rock, Chippewa Cree Tribe; Melinda Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; and Calvin Twoteeth, Chippewa Cree Tribe (pending). Chippewa Cree Business Committee The Business Committee is effectively the Tribal Council and the governing body of the Tribe; it is dominated by Chippewa Cree adoptees. The eight council members and chairman are elected at large; they serve four-year terms on staggered schedules of elections. This type of election means that each candidate must gain a majority of votes on the reservation, leaving the minority Chippewa without representation. The Tribe elected to \\"consolidate\\" the Bureau of Indian Affairs (FY 93) and Indian Health Service (FY 94) programs under Title IV of the P.l. 93-638 Act. This act gave more power to the tribes to determine their priorities and exercise governance. The sitting members of the Chippewa Cree Business Committee are the following: * Ken Blatt St. Marks, Chairman * Ted E. Whitford Sr., Vice-Chairman * Dustin Whitford, Business Committee Member * Ted Demontiney, Committee Member * Harlan Baker-Gopher, Business Committee Member * Calvin Jilot, Business Committee Member * Ted Russette III, Business Committee Member * Beau Mitchell, Business Business Committee Member Economic development According to the Tribal Chairman's address to the Havre Area Chamber of Commerce in January 2007, the annual tribal revenue of $52 million is infused into the local economy as a result of federal programs, private business, and tribal businesses on the Rocky Boy's Reservation. The majority of reservation residents work for the self-governing Chippewa Cree Tribe. Compacts are maintained with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Service. Funds originating within the BIA [note: there is only one BIA employee at Rocky Boy due to the self-governance compact], together with tribal government, provide work for 231 full- and part-time employees. The tribe has set up the Chippewa Cree Community Development Corporation, which employs 25 people. Other enterprises include Chippewa Cree Construction Company (20), Chippewa Cree Construction Corporation (14), National Tribal Development Association (9), Northern Winz Casino (70), and RJS & Associates (4), The tribe operates and administers its own educational system: the Rocky Boy public schools with 184 teachers and staff. Like other tribes, it has set up a tribal college, known as Stone Child Community College, which employs 57. It also has services for enrolled members, and operates the Chippewa Cree Housing Authority (25 employees). By the Tribe's compact with the Indian Health Service, it employs 135 staff within the Rocky Boy Health Board. In 2011, the tribe began a new business with Plain Green Loans, an online lending company. It had a staff of 25 as of December 2011. Plain Green and similar companies owned by other tribes have been criticized for profiting from high- interest online loans (called predatory lending). The Chippewa Cree are part of the Native American Lending Alliance, an organization of tribes that are in the business of online lending. Northern Winz Casino The Chippewa Cree tribe operates the Northern Winz Casino. Construction began in May 2006, with the tribal grand opening occurring in February 2007, and a public grand opening March 30, 2007. The casino is located on U.S. Highway 87, east of Box Elder, Montana. Chippewa religious institutions The Chippewa follow the peace pipe religion, rooted in the Grand Lodge or Mediwiwin society. They do not accept the use of peyote in their rites. The Chippewa reject all forms of Christianity. The grand lodge tradition is tightly held; it takes a lifetime for qualified members to learn all four levels of the society. Feeling displaced in Rocky Boy, the Chippewa have continued to practice their traditions on Hill 57, outside Great Falls, Montana. The practices had centered around Mary Chippewa Gopher, whose spiritual name was \\"Iron Claw Bear Woman\\". She was the niece of Chief Rocky Boy. Her father, Charles Chippewa or Walking Stone, was the brother to the chief. Mary Chippewa married Jim Gopher, or Loud Thunder. (notation: In the BIA technical report on the Little Shell: \\"the Chippewa included a small and distinct group, centered around the Gopher family, some of whom are still resident of \\"hill 57\\" today. This group claimed descent from a Chippewa chief from the Great Lakes area. They were identified in the studies of the \\"Hill 57\\" as descendants of a Chippewa band from the Great Lakes, unrelated to the Little Shell families, Turtle Mountain, or the bands on the Rocky Boy's reservation). This is accurate in the sense that the Chippewa were not related to the Little Bear Cree who also occupied the reservation since it was established. Currently the four levels of teachings of the sweat lodge are held by descendants of Robert Gopher, who was the youngest son of Jim and Mary Chippewa Gopher. The family are not the only ones to carry the intricate teachings and knowledge of their predecessors. Religious institutions Various Christian churches have become established at the reservation. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has a mission, Our Saviour's Lutheran Church. Toward the end of 1999, Rev. Joseph W. Bailey Sr. was joined by Christian youth groups from around the country; together they built a new sanctuary and outdoor chapel, and started work on a retreat center.Our Saviour's Lutheran Church - Our Church The Rev. Peter Guthneck officiates at St. Mary's Catholic Church. He is assisted by Sister Margaret Mary O'Doherty. The Baptist mission church was established in late 1999. The church building was erected in June 2002. The Rocky Boy Assembly of God Church is self-governing and self-supporting. Eric and Amanda Reed have shared the senior pastor in Rocky Boy in the Spring of 2006. While most of the Chippewa- Cree are Christian, some members of the tribe have maintained traditional spiritual beliefs and cultural ceremonies/activities. The traditional Thirst Dance, more commonly known as the Sun Dance, is held the first week of July. The annual Pow-Wow is held the first week of August. Other cultural events are held throughout the year, including an annual Christmas Dance, round dances, ceremonial feasts, revived cultural ceremonies, and cultural camps. Communities Rocky Boy Reservation has nine settlements, eight of which are classified by the US Census Bureau as census-designated places (CDP). Most of the CDPs are located in the Bear Paw Mountains. * Agency (official CDP name is \\"Rocky Boy's Agency\\") - population 355 at the 2010 census * Azure - located in the Bear Paw Mountains * Boneau - located 7 miles east of Box Elder, near the Bear Paw Mountains * Box Elder - population 87 at the 2010 census; located on the plains * Parker School * Rocky Boy West, or New Box Elder - population 890 at the 2010 census; located on the southeast side of Box Elder, on the plains * Saint Pierre - population 350 at the 2010 census * Sangrey - situated at the edge and just within the Bear Paw Mountains In addition, a new settlement is sited about 3 miles west of Boneau, with around 23 housing units. Hill 57 was a settlement where members of the Rocky Boy band moved after they had lost several dozen family members from starvation on Chief Mountain. Opponents of tribal termination noted the problems of the settlement, which occurred after allotment of communal lands had left members disadvantaged. A land plot inherited by Robert Gopher was obtained by George Black Tongue. He had been barred from the 1908 roll and should not have been eligible to acquire that land. The settlement at Hill 57 followed the dark period when some members of the Rocky Boy Band were assassinated; tribal members left the reservation to preserve themselves. The Chippewa Cree Tribal Constitution was passed that adopted a ten-year absentee policy, wherein members away from the reservation for longer than 10 years lost their tribal citizenship. In the early 21st century, the Chippewa are studying suing the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council. They contend that the Chippewa Cree are not a lawful recognized tribe. They believe that the tribal immunity from civil suits does not apply to individuals who do not have blood descent in a historic tribe, but claim adoptee status on a reservation. Climate Rocky Boy Reservation has a wide variation of climate conditions. Near Box Elder, the climate is warmer during the summer months, as a result of the lower elevation, and windier during the cold winter months. During the cold winter months, the Chinook Winds can cause damage around the Box Elder region. High wind storms often occur during the winter months. With the warmer temperatures, the Chinook Winds result in melting snow. The Chinook Winds also occur in the Bear Paw Mountains, but their strength there is not as great as on the open plains. The winds may warm the communities located in the Bear Paw Mountains during the winter months. Precipitation, especially in the form of snow, is somewhat higher in the mountains than on the plains. Average low temperatures during the winter months of December, January, and February at Box Elder are 9, 5, and 9. Average high temperatures for the same winter months at Box Elder are 30, 26, and 31. Average high temperatures for the summer months of June, July, and August are 76, 85, and 84. Average low temperatures for the same summer months at Box Elder are 49, 54, and 51. Notable Chippewa, Anishinaabe *Chief Rocky Boy, or Asiniweyin (as his name appears on the 1908 Chippewa Census, ), member of the Red Robe Band noted in the 1864 Pembina Chippewa Treaty, signor of the 1889 Red Lake Agreement #6, assisted in the creation of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation. With Frank B. Linderman, Charles M. Russell, Paris Gibson, and William Boles (according to the Great Falls Tribune), he established the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. *Charles Chippewa, brother to Chief Rocky Boy, was at one time the keeper of the Chief Rocky Boy bundle. This bundle is now kept by a descendant of the Rocky Boy family. *John Goodrunner (Chippewa), coordinated the annual Rain Dance, sometimes referred to as the Sun Dance, at the Rocky Boy reservation until his death. *Mary Chippewa Gopher, \\"Iron Claw Bear Woman\\", niece of Chief Rocky Boy, she led Chippewa resistance against policies of the U.S. government that interfered with tribal sovereignty. Also known as Iron Claws, she raised a family at Hill 57 after her people were dispossessed from their new reservation. She rejected inclusion of Cree on the reservation. She led her people from 1946 until her death on November 23, 1965. *Mary Bearwalker McGillis, daughter of Chief Big Rock's son Bearwalker, was a contemporary of Iron Claws. She is also credited with holding the Chippewa people together through a difficult period. *Duncan Standing Rock, Sr., elder and possessor of ceremonial knowledge of the Chippewa people. He has held the sacred bundle of Chief Rocky Boy. Robert Gopher, Listening Thunder, grand-nephew to Chief Rocky Boy, led the Chippewa resistance after the death of his parents, and fostered the Chippewa people's efforts to restore their sovereignty. Notable Chippewa-Cree  *Black Powder (c.1800 - d. 1865) was an Ojibwa ogima (leader). His date of birth is not known but may have occurred between 1800 and 1805. Ogima Black Powder was native to the Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan regions. Little has been recorded about his life. He died in 1865. Chippewa notation: Black Powder is not on the 1908 Census of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa Indians. *Big Bear (1825-c. 1888). According to historians, Big Bear was Saulteaux but raised as a Plains Cree. He was born in 1825 as the son of Black Powder, an Ojibwa chief, and an Ojibwa mother in the Jackfish Lake region of Saskatchewan, a few miles north of present-day North Battleford, Saskatchewan, and not far from Alberta. He settled primarily in the region where the present-day Saulteaux First Nation of Saskatchewan is located, near the Onion Lake First Nation. He was a leader in the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The whites arrested him as the principal leader of the short rebellion and sentenced him to prison. In early 1888, Big Bear was released. He settled on the Poundmaker First Nation, where he died soon after. Chippewa notation: Big Bear was not a predecessor to Chief Rocky Boy, for whom the Rocky Boy Reservation is named. *Little Bear (c.1850-1921). The son of Big Bear, considered Cree. Some said his mother was a Chippewa whose people had relocated from Wisconsin to Montana. Little Bear was born around 1850. After his father relocated to Montana from Idaho, the family settled in southwestern and north central Montana, depending on the season. The latter had vast herds of buffalo and was extremely important to native people. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) had reported seeing the largest buffalo herds in the region from present-day Great Falls to north of the area where the Rocky Boy Reservation is located. Little Bear was one of the principal Cree leaders who fought in the 1885 Northwest Rebellion in Canada. He was accused of taking part in the Frog Lake Massacre, along with ogima Lucky Man. After the short conflict ended, Little Bear fled as a refugee from Canada back to Montana. Little Bear was said to be the instigator of the Frog Lake massacre in Frog Lake, Saskatchewan in 1885. Little Bear's involvement in the Frog Lake Massacre is the subject of the book, Blood Red The Sun, by William B. Cameron, among a handful of captives taken by the Cree band, which continued to elude Canadian law authorities. Cameron was a clerk for the Hudson Bay Company. He later testified on behalf of Little Bear's father, Big Bear, who attempted to stop his son and supporters from instigating the massacre. Cameron identified Little Bear as the leader of the massacre, in which a total of nine were killed, including clergy. Some contemporary writings blamed Wandering Spirit. Cameron was held hostage by the Little Bear Band for two months. Little Bear's band fled to Montana, but they were subject to deportation to Canada in 1896 by the U.S. Congress.Statutes at Large from 1896, (54th Congress, Session 1) Chap. 175, \\"An Act making provision for the deportation of refugee Canadian Cree Indians from the State of Montana and their delivery to the Canadian Authorities.\\" A follow up Senate report 821 \\"Delivery of Refugee Cree Indians to Canada\\" April 29, 1896. 54th Congress, 1st session U.S. Serials set volume 3365. The newspapers reported that the Little Bear Cree forced the U.S. Cavalry back to Havre, Montana and had returned to their homeland when the troops returned from Canada. There were two distinct rolls, the 1908 census of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa, was conducted near Helena, MT by Thralls B. Wheat, an allotting agent of the Department of the Interior. This was the only legal census of the Rocky Boy Band; it was supervised by Chief Rocky Boy. Neither Little Bear, nor members of his band appear on this roll. In 1914, Chief Rocky Boy was corresponding with Interior Secretary Franklin Lane, and expressed the Chippewa band's neutrality in the World War I conflict. He also wrote to President Woodrow Wilson, dated September 25, 1914, expressing the band's position. No Chippewa Cree tribe existed at the time; official correspondence refers only to Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians. Chief Big Rock enacted his own Chippewa council following Rocky Boy's death, consisting of Pat Raspberry, Standing Rock, Charles Mosney, and Crazy Boy. This council held a formal council and pipe ceremony in Great Falls with white supporters: writer Frank B. Linderman, Theodore Gibson, William Boles, and painter Charles M. Russell. By the start of the 20th century, Little Bear returned to Montana, his native country, and began to follow Rocky Boy. In 1905, Little Bear contacted Canadian leaders to request allowing the Cree from Montana to relocate to Canada. Officials agreed and the Cree settled primarily with the Onion Lake First Nation and the Samson First Nation (this reserve includes the Ermineskin, Louis Bull, and Montana First Nations). In 1908, Little Bear again contacted Canadian leaders requesting permission for more landless Chippewa and Cree to relocate from Montana to Canada. After the Rocky Boy Reservation was officially established in 1916, Little Bear followed Rocky Boy and his band there, bringing about 200 of his own people. He took over as leader of the new Reservation after Rocky Boy's death in 1916. Little Bear died in 1921. Ultimately Little Bear Cree and those descendants of the Riel Rebellion leaders made up 406 of the McLaughlin Roll. Only 45 of those who were on the 1908 Wheat roll managed to secure membership at the Rocky Boy's reservation, which had been authorized for Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians.\\" <64th Congress>: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act approved February eleventh, nineteen hundred and fifteen (Thirty-eighth Statutes at Large, page eight hundred and seven), entitled \\"An Act authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to survey the lands of the abandoned Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation and open the same to settlement,\\" be, and the same is hereby, amended by the addition thereto of the following sections: \\"SEC. 10. That fractional townships twenty-eight north, ranges fifteen and sixteen east, and fractional townships twenty-nine north, ranges fourteen and fifteen east, Montana principal meridian, within the boundaries of said reservation, embracing a total area of approximately fifty-six thousand and thirty-five acres, are hereby set apart as a reservation for Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewas and such other homeless Indians in the State of Montana as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to locate thereon, and the said Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to allot the lands within the reservation hereby created under the provisions of the general allotment Act of February eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven (Twenty\\"fourth Statutes at Large, page three hundred and eighty-eight), as amended. Cree nativity to Montana is disputed by Chippewa who contend that during the negotiations of the treaties that encompass the area of Montana, the noted Smithsonian ethnologist, John C. Ewers found not a single member of Little Bear's band, who were now on the 1917 McLaughlin Roll of the US. Department of the Interior; were born in the treaty land cede area. Therefore, the U.S. Indian Claims Commission dismissed Cree treaty claims . Still further, the Canadian Council Privy attempted to work with U.S. authorities to exert authority to return the Little Bear Band to Canada, prior to the 1896 Act of Deportation. *Rocky Boy (c.1852-d. 1916) Asiniweyin, more correctly called Stone Being. The true origin of Asiniweyin, he was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. He was a member of the Red Robe Band, Red Robe, or Moose Dung, was a signor of the 1864 Pembina Treaty. Other sources say he was born in Wisconsin and migrated to the Montana region in the 1880s. Rocky Boy claimed to be native to southwest Montana and may have lived in southern Idaho. He became a popular leader in the early 1900s among both the Chippewa and the European Americans. He managed to gain Executive Orders by United States presidents to set aside land for two Chippewa-Cree reservations in northeastern Montana. Rocky Boy died in 1916, before Congress officially established the Rocky Boy's Reservation. Some sources have speculated he was assassinated, including noted Smithsonian historian and expert on Plains tribal culture, John C. Ewers. Frank Bird Linderman's correspondence with Chippewa Chief Big Rock also indicated Big Rock explained not only Rocky Boy's assassination, but Big Rock's own son's were also assassinated by rival Cree in the Ft. Assiniboine area in the days after Chief Rocky Boy's death. *Pennato: The brother of Rocky Boy, Pennato had suggested that the Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation become a new closed Chippewa-Cree Reservation. In December 1911, Pennato and 150 Chippewa fled the Babb Chippewa Reservation. (Source needed). With respect to enrollment in Rocky Boy, because the reservation was established by an Act of Congress for \\"Rocky Boy's Band of Chippewa Indians and such other homeless Indians,\\" the language of the law was intended in 1908 by Chief Rocky Boy and Thralls B. Wheat, to leave the door to enrollment open to his brethren who were away on a hunt at the time of the Wheat Census. . The Chief Big Rock family were away as was often done, Chippewa bands separate during hunting excursions, hunting in western Montana. Because they were not directly enumerated in the Wheat census, Chief Rocky Boy inserted the language of the Act to include Big Rock's extended family. The language of the Act was not intended to include anyone other than the whole Rocky Boy band, and was limited to Big Rock's family. Ironically, Big Rock is listed on the 1917 McLaughlin census. Chief Big Rock's place of birth is listed as Red Lake, Minnesota. This is the true and legitimate successor to Chief Rocky Boy. Some oral history has indicated Big Rock was Chief Rocky Boy's brother, moreover, Chippewa have held Big Rock to be the main \\"ogemaw\\" and Rocky Boy was more of a spokesman to him, or a sub-chief. Only the present day Bearwalker family line are the living descendants of Chief Big Rock. After Little Bear took over the affairs of the soon to be established reservation, and the flight to Chief Mountain‚ÄîBig Rock's family perished on Chief Mountain, from the combined effects of tuberculosis and starvation. Chief Rocky Boy had been under increased pressure to add the Cree and Metis to his rolls by government officials. Even after the reservation was to be created, in the spring of 1916, Frank Bird Linderman met with Chief Big Rock in northside, Great Falls, and other Chippewa tribesmen including Standing Rock, Pat Raspberry, Crazy Boy (Chief Rocky Boy's brother), and Charles Mosney. On his death bed, and his last letter to Frank B. Linderman, Rocky Boy stated \\"I don't know if I will ever see you again, Little Bear (referring to their inclusion, along with Metis led by Kennawash)... is trying to get them all in. It is up to my band of Chippewa Indians to let them in.\\" Rocky Boy's understanding of the working of tribal sovereignty is correct. . There is a legal theoretical split, those that attempt to document and claim a Chippewa Cree identity, and the original descendants of Rocky boy's Chippewa band who reject these claims.

Sharrock Published New York : Garland Pub. Inc., 1974. The Chippewa view the Department of the Interior's mishandling of the 1908 roll, the raising of an illegal 1917 McLaughlin Roll, and the mismanaged Pembina judgments as overreaching paternalism roundly rejected by the majority of U.S. tribes into one tribe's affairs. Ewers wrote \\"it will be for courts to decide if a Chippewa Cree tribe existed prior to 1935,\\" foretelling the contemporary conflict. To the trained ethnologist's eye, the writing was on the wall 40 years ago. Ewers also correctly predicted this matter would ultimately be decided on contentious terms, most likely the courts.

He claimed that he had studied his ancestral tree and discovered that most of the land of Kowloon belonged to his ancestors. He said that Kowloon belonged to his grandfather. There are no records to back up Tsang's claim. His artwork He was arrested for his graffiti several times, but the police usually just gave him a warning or a small fine. His family disowned him, saying he was mentally unbalanced and a public nuisance, 14 August 1998 and his wife had grown tired of his obsession and left him. Although his graffiti was repeatedly painted over, he often returned to re-apply his messages as soon as the paint dried. At the height of his graffiti career, his obsessive marking of territory made his graffiti an ever-present aspect of the streets of Hong Kong. The graffiti has been spotted at many places on the streets of Hong Kong, ranging from lampposts, utility boxes, pillars, pavements, street furniture, and building walls, to an occasional car. The contents of his calligraphic graffiti usually include his name, his title (Emperor or King of Kowloon, Hong Kong, or China), his family tree (a variable list of about 20 individuals), the names of illustrious emperors, and the exclamation, \\"Down with the Queen of England!\\" His complaints about the supposed misappropriation of his land were not always so formulaic, however. He occasionally demanded that the government pay him land taxes.The Standard , 26 July 2007 A Hong Kong magazine named him one of the city's ten least influential people. However, this supposed lack of influence does not extend to the art world. His typography has inspired many fashion designers, art directors, interior decorators, and CD cover artists.

During his last years, he lived in a retirement home, and no longer wrote on walls. However, his poor health did not entirely halt his calligraphic efforts. He continued his work on paper, household linens, and other mundane items. He also told visitors that he should have been elected chief executive of Hong Kong, instead of Donald Tsang, that \\"impostor\\". He received international recognition for his work.

Stansbury was laid down on 9 December 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Union Iron Works at San Francisco, launched on 16 May 1919, sponsored by Miss Mary Eleanor Trevorrow, and commissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 8 January 1920, Commander J. W. Lewis in command. Service history Stansbury served with the Pacific Fleet for over two years during which time she received the designation DD-180. On 27 May 1922, she was decommissioned and berthed at San Diego. She remained inactive for more than 12 years, but the onset of World War II in September 1939 necessitated her reactivation along with that of many of her sister ships. Accordingly, Stansbury was recommissioned at San Diego on 29 August 1940, Lieutenant Commander R. N. McFarlane in command. From there, she moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard to begin her conversion to a high-speed minesweeper. In October, she proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where the conversion was completed. On 19 November, she was redesignated a destroyer minesweeper, DMS-8. World War II Stansbury was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet from October 1940 to December 1943. She spent her first year in the Atlantic in minesweeping exercises, in coastwise escort duties, and in conducting maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. On 30 June 1942, while escorting from Norfolk to Bermuda, she attacked a German U-boat with depth charges. A rough sea and rescue operations for survivors of the torpedoed merchantmen handicapped her during the unsuccessful attack. However, her humanitarian effort proved successful, for on 1 July, she pulled into Bermuda with 390 survivors embarked. The destroyer minesweeper set out from Norfolk on 24 October 1942 to join Task Force (TF) 34, the North Africa invasion force. Stansbury was assigned to Mine Squadron (MinRon) 7 of the Center Attack Group for the landings. The group's assault area was at Fedala just up the coast from Casablanca. The ships arrived off the objective area on 7 November. Stansbury and the other minesweepers made an exploratory sweep of the approaches and then she joined the screen in patrolling the transport area. On 15 November, was torpedoed, but thanks to the efforts of Stansbury, , and she remained afloat throughout the night and was beached at Casablanca the following morning. The destroyer minesweeper returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 December 1942. For the next year, she plied the eastern coastal waters of the United States and the North Atlantic as far east as Iceland. On 4 December 1943, Stansbury transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet. She conducted minesweeping exercises off the coast of California for about a month; then stood out of San Diego on 13 January 1944 and headed west with TF 53. The task force reached Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 22 January and sailed for the Marshalls the following day. Stansbury operated in the anti-submarine screen both during the voyage to Kwajalein and during the assault itself. She remained in the vicinity from 1 to 7 February, and then joined an amphibious group in returning to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands. On 13 February, she sailed to Noumea, New Caledonia, arriving on the 20th. For almost four months, Stansbury made the South Pacific circuit, screening numerous amphibious and logistics groups. She visited the Solomons and New Hebrides groups, New Britain, and escorted part of the Admiralty Islands assault force to its objective in mid-April. She returned to the central Pacific, in May, at Eniwetok. On 10 June, she and nine other destroyer minesweepers departed Eniwetok and, three days later, rendezvoused off Saipan with TF 58, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force. The minesweepers swept off the west coast of the island while TF 58 covered them. After about five hours of clearing mines, they retired and joined an advance bombardment group from TF 53. Stansbury helped screen the big warships from enemy submarines until the arrival of the initial invasion forces on 15 June, then she joined in a bombardment of Guam. Returning to the vicinity of Saipan and Tinian, she provided fire support for the troops ashore until 26 June when she headed back to Eniwetok. On 21 July, after almost four weeks absence, she returned to the Marianas with TF 53 to support the recapture of Guam. For a week, she screened the task force from submarines and performed picket patrol for the amphibious units. On 28 July, she returned to Eniwetok as part of the escort for a transport group. On 7 August, the destroyer minesweeper got underway from Eniwetok for San Francisco, via Pearl Harbor. She reached her destination on 26 August and entered the yard of the General Engineering & Dry Dock Co. Her overhaul was completed on 17 January 1945, and Stansbury sailed to San Diego, arriving the following day. There she reported for duty with the San Diego Shakedown Group. For the remainder of the war, she served as a training ship for the Fleet Operational Training Command, Pacific Fleet. Her designation was changed from DMS-8 to AG-107 on 5 June 1945. In September 1945, Stansbury transited the Panama Canal again and headed for Norfolk, Virginia. She was decommissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 December 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 January 1946. Her hulk was sold to Luria Bros. Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 26 October, and she was scrapped on 25 January 1947. Awards Stansbury was awarded three battle stars during World War II. As of 2004, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

After a brief active life, the ship was deactivated in 1922 and placed in reserve for 18 years before returning to service in 1940 during World War II. She was later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Bath (I17), as a , and then to the Royal Norwegian Navy as HNoMS Bath. Bath was torpedoed while escorting a trans-Atlantic convoy on 19 August 1941. Construction and career  United States Navy service  Named for Pollard Hopewell, she was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, Virginia on 8 June 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Orote Hutcheson. The destroyer was commissioned on 22 March 1919 at Portsmouth, Virginia, Lieutenant Commander R. E. Rodgers in command. Hopewell sailed from Norfolk on 19 April 1919 to join the 3rd Destroyer Squadron in New England waters, and in May was on observation station off the Azores during the historic crossing of the Atlantic by Navy seaplanes. The destroyer returned to New York City on 8 June to complete her interrupted fitting out, and rejoined her squadron in August for firing tests. The winter of 1920 was spent on intensive training and target practice in Caribbean waters. The ship returned to New England in early May, where she remained until September training reservists and engaging in division maneuvers. Arriving at Charleston, South Carolina on 22 September, Hopewell carried out similar operations out of the South Carolina port, returning to New York in May 1921 for reserve training. Sailing from Newport, Rhode Island on 10 October, the destroyer was placed in reserve at Charleston until 10 April, when she departed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Hopewell decommissioned there on 17 July 1922. She recommissioned on 17 June 1940 as the United States prepared for World War II, and after operating with the Neutrality Patrol off New England arrived at Halifax on 18 September. She decommissioned on 23 September and was transferred to Great Britain as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.  Royal Navy service  Renamed HMS Bath, she crossed the Atlantic and arrived at Devenport on 12 October 1940, and after a short refit, joined the 1st Minelaying Squadron based at the Kyle of Lochalsh. Bath was used to escort minesweeping operations by the squadron and for convoys.Hague (1988), p. 22. At the end of January 1941, Bath went into refit at Chatham Dockyard to better suit her for escort duties. The aft 4-inch and 3-inch guns were removed, and replaced by a single 12-pounder (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun. Two sets of torpedo tubes were removed, while one mast was removed and the foremast shortened to reduce topweight.Hague (1989), p. 12.Friedman (2009), p. 259.  Royal Norwegian Navy service  On 9 April 1941, following completion of the refit, Bath transferred to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. As HNoMS Bath she began operation as part of the \\"Liverpool Escort Force\\" as a member of the 5th Escort Group early in June, escorting convoys between the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, but had a very brief subsequent career, being sunk by the German submarine on 19 August 1941, while escorting the convoy, Convoy OG 71, bound for Gibraltar. She was hit in the engine room on the starboard side by two torpedoes and broke in two, sinking in three minutes. As she sank two of her depth charges exploded killing some of the crew in the water. Of her 128 crew, only 42 were rescued by HMS Hydrangea and but two of those subsequently died aboard Hydrangea.Edwards (2009), pp. 21‚Äì23 References * Bibliography  * External links *HMS Bath *Uboat.net on HNoMS Bath (I 17) *NavSource Photos *List of Bath casualties *Information on Convoy OG-71 Category:Wickes-class destroyers Category:1918 ships Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Royal Navy Category:Town-class destroyers of the Royal Navy Category:Town- class destroyers converted from Wickes-class destroyers Category:World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:Town-class destroyers of the Royal Norwegian Navy Category:World War II destroyers of Norway Category:Ships sunk by German submarines in World War II Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in August 1941 Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia ","title":"USS Hopewell (DD-181)"},{"id":"1122457","text":"Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Hopewell. * was a launched in June 1918 and transferred to the Royal Navy in September 1940 * was a launched in May 1943 Category:United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Hopewell"},{"id":"1122464","text":"Terra Linda High School (also known as TLHS and more commonly known as TL) is a public secondary school located in Terra Linda, San Rafael, California, United States.

The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia. The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard Government's Pacific Solution. The centre was suspended in 2008 to fulfil an election promise by the Rudd Government, but was reopened in August 2012 by the Gillard government after a large increase in the number of maritime arrivals by asylum seekersand pressure from the Abbott opposition. Current Coalition and Labor Party policy states that because all detainees attempted to reach Australia by boat, they will never be settled in Australia, even though many of the asylum seekers detained on the island have been assessed as genuine refugees. The highest population at the centre was 1,233 detainees in August 2014. A number of detainees have since been returned to their countries of origin, including Iraq and Iran. By November 2018, some refugees from Nauru (430 in total from both offshore facilities) had been resettled in the United States, but hopes of the US taking more had faded. Although New Zealand has repeatedly offered to take 150 per year, the Australian Government would not agree to this. There were still 23 children on the island, although the government had bowed to public pressure and started removing families with children, after reports of suicidal behaviour and resignation syndrome had emerged. In February 2019, the last four children on the island (of an original 200 in detention on Nauru in 2013) were resettled in the United States with their families. By 31 March 2019, there were no people held in the detention centre, which had been closed; however as of March 2020, there were 211 refugees and asylum seekers remaining on the island. As of 13 June 2020, a father and son were the last family left on Nauru; there is one single woman and the rest are single men. Podcast only , over 100 men from Manus and Nauru are being detained in a hotel in Brisbane, after being transferred to the mainland for medical treatment. They are confined to quarters under a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and legislation has been introduced to parliament to remove mobile phones from refugees and asylum seekers in detention, which has been widely condemned and protested. History 2001: establishment Outdoor sinks at the centre Central space The establishment of an offshore processing centre on Nauru was based on a Statement of Principles, signed on 10 September 2001 by the President of Nauru, Ren√© Harris, and Australia's then-Minister for Defence, Peter Reith. The statement opened the way to establish a detention centre for up to 800 people and was accompanied by a pledge of 20 million for development activities. The initial detainees were to be people rescued by the MV Tampa (Tampa affair), with the understanding that they would leave Nauru by May 2002. Subsequently, a memorandum of understanding was signed on 11 December, boosting accommodation to 1,200 and the promised development activity by an additional $10 million. Initial plans were for asylum seekers to be housed in modern, air-conditioned housing which had been built for the games of the International Weightlifting Federation. This plan was changed after landowners' requests for extra compensation were rejected. Two camps were built. The first camp, called \\"Topside\\", was at an old sports ground and oval in the Meneng District (). The second camp, called \\"State House\\", was on the site of the old Presidential quarters also in the Meneng District (). A month- long hunger strike began on 10 December 2003. It included mostly Hazara from Afghanistan rescued during the Tampa affair, who were protesting for the review of their cases. By July 2005, 32 people were detained in Nauru as asylum seekers: 16 Iraqis, 11 Afghans, 2 Iranians, 2 Bangladeshis, and 1 Pakistani. All but two Iraqis were released to Australia, the last group of 25 leaving on 1 November 2005. The remaining two Iraqis stayed in custody for over a year. The last one was finally accepted by an undisclosed Scandinavian country after five years in detention, in January 2007. The other was in an Australian hospital at the time, and was later given permission to remain in Australia while his asylum case was being decided.

Aug-Sept 2019 update on numbers The Australian government reported that as of 28 August 2019 there were 288 people left on Nauru; 330 had been resettled in the US; and another 85 people had been approved for resettlement in the US, but had not yet left. It was reported that as of 30 September, total numbers of asylum seekers left in PNG and Nauru was 562 (23 percent of the peak, in June 2014), and another 1,117 people had been \\"temporarily transferred to Australia for medical treatment or as accompanying family members\\". Numbers for each facility were not given separately. March-May 2020 In March 2020, Home Affairs told the Senate estimates committee that \\"211 refugees and asylum seekers remained on Nauru, 228 in Papua New Guinea, and about 1,220, including their dependents, were in Australia to receive medical treatment\\". Transfer and resettlement of approved refugees in the US was proceeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. June 2020: Brisbane , over 100 men from Manus and Nauru are being detained in an hotel in Kangaroo Point in Brisbane, after being transferred to the mainland for medical treatment. They are confined to quarters under a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and legislation has been introduced to parliament to remove mobile phones from refugees and asylum seekers in detention, which has been widely condemned. The men have held protests from their balconies, and protestors have gathered outside on several occasions.

In 2002, detainees deplored the water shortages and overcrowded conditions. There were only very limited education services for children. On 19 July 2013 there was a major riot in the detention centre. Several buildings were destroyed by fire, and damage was estimated at $60 million. Hunger strikes and self-harm, including detainees sewing their lips together, have been reported at the facility, as well as at least two people setting themselves on fire. Attempted suicides were also reported. Medical staff have been provided by International Organization for Migration. Graph of detainee population by month at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders in September 2013 An overwhelming sense of despair has been repeatedly expressed by detainees because of the uncertainty of their situation and their remoteness from loved ones. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as \\"like a concentration camp\\". In 2015, several staff members from the detention centre wrote an open letter claiming that multiple instances of sexual abuse against women and children had occurred. The letter claimed that the Australian government had been aware of these abuses for over 18 months. This letter added weight to the Moss review which found it possible that \\"guards had traded marijuana for sexual favours with asylum seeker children\\". In 2018, reports of children engaging in self-harm and attempting suicide drew attention back to the conditions at the centre. Children as young as eight were documented as exhibiting suicidal behaviours, and an estimated 30 children were described as suffering from resignation syndrome, a progressive, deteriorating psychiatric condition that can be fatal. Extreme trauma experienced both in their country of origin and in their daily lives at the camp, coupled with a sense of hopelessness and abandonment, are thought to have contributed to the onset of this condition. Media access Media access to the island of Nauru, and the Regional Processing Centre in particular, is tightly controlled by the Nauruan government. In January 2014, the Nauru government announced it was raising the cost of a media visa to the island from AUD$200 to $8,000, non-refundable if the visa was not granted. Since then journalists from Al Jazeera, the ABC, SBS and The Guardian have stated that they have applied for media visas with no success. The last journalist to visit the island before the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders was Nick Bryant of the BBC. In 2014 the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) made it a crime, punishable with up to a 10-year prison sentence, to disclose any special intelligence operation, including relating to asylum seekers. This provided little protection to journalists seeking to report on information from whistle-blowers. It caused professional journalists as well as teachers and health professionals employed in these detention centres, to be silenced. Journalists were prevented from entering or reporting and staff members were gagged under draconian employment contracts that prevented them from speaking about anything happening in Australia's offshore detention centre, under threat of a prison sentence. The Secrecy and Disclosure Provisions of the 1 July 2015 Australian Border Force Act ruled that workers who spoke of any incidents from within one of the centres would receive a 2-year prison sentence. This was later watered down in amendments put forward by Peter Dutton in August 2017, after doctors and other health professionals had mounted a high court challenge. The amendments would apply retrospectively and stipulated that the secrecy provision would only apply to information that could compromise Australia's security, defence or international relations, interfere with criminal investigations offences, or affect sensitive personal or commercial matters. In October 2015, Chris Kenny, a political commentator for The Australian, became the first Australian journalist to visit Nauru in over 18 months. While on the island, Kenny interviewed a Somalian refugee known as \\"Abyan\\", who alleged she had been raped on Nauru and requested an abortion of the resulting pregnancy. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre accused Kenny of forcing his way into Abyan's quarters to speak to her‚Äîa claim Kenny strongly denied. In June 2016, the Press Council of Australia dismissed a complaint regarding the wording of his article and its headline. In June 2016, a television crew from A Current Affair was granted access to the island and the centre. Reporter Caroline Marcus presented asylum seekers housed in fully equipped demountable units, and provided with their own television, microwave, airconditioning units and refrigerator. In a column in The Daily Telegraph and an interview with ACA host Tracy Grimshaw, Marcus denied that there were any conditions on the crew's visit, and stated that the Australian government had been unaware of the crew being granted visas until after they had arrived on the island.

Langton is the first-born son of Jane Langton, author of books including the Homer Kelly Mysteries. He has two adult sons: Gabe and Colin. Artificial life Langton made numerous contributions to the field of artificial life, both in terms of simulation and computational models of given problems and to philosophical issues. He early identified the problems of information, computation and reproduction as intrinsically connected with complexity and its basic laws. Inspired by ideas coming from physics, particularly phase transitions, he developed several key concepts and quantitative measures for cellular automata and suggested that critical points separating order from disorder could play a very important role in shaping complex systems, particularly in biology. These ideas were also explored simultaneously, albeit with different approximations, by James P. Crutchfield and Per Bak among others. While a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Langton created the Langton ant and Langton loop, both simple artificial life simulations, in addition to his Lambda parameter, a dimensionless measure of complexity and computation potential in cellular automata, given by a chosen state divided by all the possible states. For a 2-state, 1-r neighborhood, 1D cellular automata the value is close to 0.5. For a 2-state, Moore neighborhood, 2D cellular automata, like Conway's Life, the value is 0.273.

History Daily News Building The Daily News was founded by Melville E. Stone, Percy Meggy, and William Dougherty in 1875 and began publishing on December 23. Byron Andrews, fresh out of Hobart College, was one of the first reporters. The paper aimed for a mass readership in contrast to its primary competitor, the Chicago Tribune, which appealed to the city's elites. The Daily News was Chicago's first penny paper, and the city's most widely read newspaper in the late nineteenth century. Victor F. Lawson bought the Chicago Daily News in 1876 and became its business manager. Stone remained involved as an editor and later bought back an ownership stake, but Lawson took over full ownership again in 1888.Scott, Frank William, and Edmund Janes James. Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814‚Äì1879, (Google Books link), Harvard University, 1910, p. 127. Independent newspaper During his long tenure at the Daily News, Victor Lawson pioneered many areas of reporting, opening one of the first foreign bureaus among U.S. newspapers in 1898. In 1912, the Daily News became one of a cooperative of four newspapers, including the New York Globe, The Boston Globe, and the Philadelphia Bulletin, to form the Associated Newspapers syndicate. In 1922, Lawson started one of the first columns devoted to radio. He also introduced many innovations to business operations including advances in newspaper promotion, classified advertising, and syndication of news stories, serials, and comics.Former President & Publisher, Daily News (Advertising Federation of America. Hall of fame) Editor A. B. Blair 1915. Victor Lawson died in August 1925, leaving no instructions in his will regarding the disposition of the Daily News. Walter A. Strong, who was Lawson's business manager, spent the rest of the year raising the capital he needed to buy the Daily News. The Chicago Daily News Corporation, of which Strong was the major stockholder, bought the newspaper for $13.5 million ‚Äì the highest price paid for a newspaper up to that time. Strong was the president and publisher of the Chicago Daily News Corporation from December 1925 until his death in May 1931. As Lawson's business manager, Strong partnered with The Fair Department Store to create a new radio station. Strong asked Judith C. Waller to run the new station. When Waller protested that she didn't know anything about running a station. Strong replied ‚Äúneither do I, but come down and we‚Äôll find out.‚Äù Waller was hired in February 1922 and went on to have a long and distinguished career in broadcasting. What would become WMAQ (AM) had its inaugural broadcast April 12, 1922. That same year, the rival Chicago Tribune began to experiment with radio news at Westinghouse-owned KYW. In 1924 the Tribune briefly took over station WJAZ, changing its call letters to WGN, then purchased station WDAP outright and permanently transferred the WGN call letters to this second station. The Daily News would eventually take full ownership of the station and absorb shared band rival WQJ, which was jointly owned by the Calumet Baking Powder Company and the Rainbo Gardens ballroom. WMAQ would pioneer many firsts in radio‚Äîone of them the first complete Chicago Cubs season broadcast on radio in 1925, hosted by sportswriter-turned- sportscaster Hal Totten. In April 1930, WMAQ was organized as a subsidiary corporation with Walter Strong as its Chairman of the Board, and Judith Waller as Vice President and Station Manager. On August 2, 1929, it was announced that the Chicago Daily Journal was consolidating with the Daily News, and the Journal published its final issue on August 21.Associated Press, ‚ÄúTwo Chicago Papers Form Consolidation,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 3 August 1929, Volume 64, Number 156, page 2. By the late 1920s, it was apparent to Walter Strong that his newspaper and broadcast operations needed more space. He acquired the air rights over the railroad tracks that ran along the west side of the Chicago River. He commissioned architects Holabird & Root to design a modern building over the tracks that would have newspaper production facilities and radio studios. The 26-floor Chicago Daily News Building opened in 1929. It featured a large plaza with a fountain dedicated to Strong's mentor, Victor Lawson, and a mural by John W. Norton depicting the newspaper production process. The Art Deco structure became a Chicago landmark, and stands today under the name Riverside Plaza. In 1930, the radio station obtained a license for an experimental television station, W9XAP, but had already begun transmitting from it just prior to its being granted. Working with Sears Roebuck stores by providing them with the receivers, those present at the stores were able to see Bill Hay, (the announcer for Amos 'n' Andy), present a variety show from the Daily News building, on August 27, 1930. Ulises Armand Sanabria was the television pioneer behind this and other early Chicago television experiments. In 1931 The Daily News sold WMAQ to NBC. In its heyday as an independent newspaper from the 1930s to 1950s the Daily News was widely syndicated and boasted a first-class foreign news service.The Press: Genius (Time Magazine. Jan. 04, 1926) It became known for its distinctive, aggressive writing style which 1920s editor Henry Justin Smith likened to a daily novel. This style became the hallmark of the newspaper: ‚ÄúFor generations,‚Äù as Wayne Klatt puts it in ‚ÄúChicago Journalism: A History,‚Äù ‚Äúnewspeople had been encouraged to write on the order of Charles Dickens, but the Daily News was instructing its staff to present facts in cogent short paragraphs, which forced rivals to do the same.‚ÄùGoogle Books In the 1950s, city editor Clement Quirk Lane (whose son John would become Walter Cronkite's executive producer) issued a memo to the staff that has become something of a memorial of the paper's house style, a copy of which can be found on Lane's entry. Knight Newspapers and Field Enterprises Sun-Times and Daily News headquarters After a long period of ownership by Knight Newspapers (later Knight Ridder), the paper was acquired in 1959 by Field Enterprises, owned by heirs of the former owner of the Marshall Field and Company department store chain. Field already owned the morning Chicago Sun-Times, and the Daily News moved into the Sun-Times' building on North Wabash Avenue. A few years later Mike Royko became the paper's lead columnist, and quickly rose to local and national prominence. However, the Field years were mostly a period of decline for the newspaper, partly due to management decisions but also due to demographic changes; the circulation of afternoon dailies generally declined with the rise of television, and downtown newspapers suffered as readers moved to the suburbs. In 1977 the Daily News was redesigned and added features intended to increase its appeal to younger readers, but the changes did not reverse the paper's continuing decline in circulation. The Chicago Daily News published its last edition on Saturday, March 4, 1978. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, later in 1978, Lloyd H Weston, president, editor and publisher of Addison Leader Newspapers, Inc. -- a group of weekly tabloids in the west and northwest suburbs‚Äîobtained rights to the Chicago Daily News trademark. Under a new corporation, CDN Publishing Co., Inc., based in DuPage County, Weston published a number of special editions of the Chicago Daily News, including one celebrating the Chicago Auto Show. The following year, a Rosemont-based group headed by former Illinois governor Richard B. Ogilvie contracted to purchase CDN Publishing, with the expressed intention of publishing the Chicago Daily News as a weekend edition beginning that August. Weston hosted a party celebrating the signing of the contract with Ogilvie at the iconic Pump Room in the Ambassador Chicago Hotel. The gala was attended by hundreds of the city's well-known names in politics, publishing. broadcasting and advertising. The next day, Ogilvie reneged on the deal. The check he signed as payment to Weston bounced. And his corporation filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Weston's last edition of the Chicago Daily News featured extensive photo coverage of the Oct. 4, 1979 visit to Chicago of Pope John Paul II. In 1984, Weston sold his rights to the Chicago Daily News trademark to Rupert Murdoch, who, at the time, was owner and publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times. The headquarters of the Daily News and Sun-Times was located at 401 North Wabash before the building was demolished. It is now the site of Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons, mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact, if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language. Some poorly known extinct languages, such as Gutian and Cac√°n, are simply unclassifiable, and it is unlikely the situation will ever change. A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all, or even a distinct dialect, but merely a family, tribal or village name, or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified. If a language's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families, as in the case of Basque in Europe, it is considered a language isolate ‚Äì that is, it is classified as a language family of its own. An 'unclassified' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done. Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely, unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered. Classification challenges An example of a language that has caused multiple problems for classification is Mimi of Decorse in Chad. This language is only attested in a single word list collected ca. 1900. At first it was thought to be a Maban language, because of similarities to Maba, the first Maban language to be described. However, as other languages of the Maban family were described, it became clear that the similarities were solely with Maba itself, and the relationship was too distant for Mimi to be related specifically to Maba and not equally to the other Maban languages. The obvious similarities are therefore now thought to be due to borrowings from Maba, which is the socially dominant language in the area. When such loans are discounted, there is much less data to classify Mimi with, and what does remain is not particularly similar to any other language or language family. Mimi might therefore be a language isolate, or perhaps a member of some other family related to Maban in the proposed but as yet undemonstrated Nilo-Saharan phylum. It would be easier to address the problem with better data, but no-one has been able to find speakers of the language again. It also happens that a language may be unclassified within an established family. That is, it may be obvious that it is, say, a Malayo-Polynesian language, but not clear in which branch of Malayo-Polynesian it belongs. When a family consists of many similar languages with great degree of confusing contact, a large number of languages may be effectively unclassified in this manner. Families where this is a substantial problem include Malayo-Polynesian, Bantu, Pama‚ÄìNyungan, and Arawakan. Examples by reason There are hundreds of unclassified languages, most of them extinct, although there are some, albeit relatively few, that are still spoken; in the following list, the extinct languages are labeled with a dagger (‚Ä†). Absence of data These languages are unclassifiable, not just unclassified, because while there may be record of a language existing there may not be enough materials in it to analyze and classify, especially with now-extinct languages. (See, for example, a list of unclassified languages of South America.) * Sentinelese (Andaman Islands) ‚Äì a living presumed language of an uncontacted people * Weyto‚Ä† (Ethiopia) * Nam‚Ä† (Chinese‚ÄìTibetan border) ‚Äì data remains undeciphered * Harappan‚Ä† (Indus Valley Civilisation 33rd‚Äì13th centuries BC) ‚Äì data remains undeciphered * Cypro-Minoan‚Ä† (Cyprus 15th‚Äì10th centuries BC) ‚Äì data remains undeciphered * Lullubi‚Ä† (Iran) * ‚Ä† (Tanzania) * Guale‚Ä† and Yamasee‚Ä† (US) * Himarim√£ (Brazil) ‚Äì a living presumed language of an uncontacted people * Nagarchal‚Ä† (India) ‚Äì assumed to have been Dravidian Scarcity of data Many of these languages are also considered unclassifiable, as the amount of data may not be enough to reveal close relatives if there were some. For others there may be enough data to show the language belongs to a particular family, but not where within it, or to show the language has no close relatives, but not enough to conclude that it is a language isolate. * Solano‚Ä† (Mexico) * Cac√°n‚Ä† (Argentina) * Kujarg√© (Chad) * Bung (Cameroon) * Luo (Cameroon) * Lufu (Nigeria) * Mawa‚Ä† (Nigeria) * Komta‚Ä† (Nigeria) * Wawu‚Ä† (Ghana or Ivory Coast?) * ‚Ä†?

In 1639, the English East India Company purchased the village of Madraspatnam and one year later it established the Agency of Fort St George, precursor of the Madras Presidency, although there had been Company factories at Machilipatnam and Armagon since the very early 1600s. The agency was upgraded to a Presidency in 1652 before once more reverting to its previous status in 1655. In 1684, it was re- elevated to a Presidency and Elihu Yale was appointed as president. In 1785, under the provisions of Pitt's India Act, Madras became one of three provinces established by the East India Company. Thereafter, the head of the area was styled \\"Governor\\" rather than \\"President\\" and became subordinate to the Governor-General in Calcutta, a title that would persist until 1947. Judicial, legislative and executive powers rested with the Governor who was assisted by a Council whose constitution was modified by reforms enacted in 1861, 1909, 1919 and 1935. Regular elections were conducted in Madras up to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. By 1908, the province comprised twenty-two districts, each under a District Collector, and it was further sub-divided into taluks and firqas with villages making up the smallest unit of administration. Following the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms of 1919, Madras was the first province of British India to implement a system of dyarchy, and thereafter its Governor ruled alongside a prime minister. In the early decades of the 20th century, many significant contributors to the Indian independence movement came from Madras. With the advent of Indian independence on 15 August 1947, the Presidency became the Madras Province. Madras was later admitted as Madras State, a state of the Indian Union at the inauguration of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950.  Origins   Before the arrival of the English  The discovery of dolmens from this portion of the subcontinent shows inhabitation as early as the Stone Age. The first prominent rulers of the northern part of the future Presidency were the Tamil Pandya dynasty (230 BCAD 102). Following the decline of the Pandyas and the Cholas, the country was conquered by a little known race of people called the Kalabhras.Iyengar 1929, p. 535 The country recovered under the subsequent Pallava dynasty and its civilisation attained a peak when the later Telugu kings started acquiring vast places in Tamil Nadu. Following the conquest of Madurai by Malik Kafur in 1311, there was a brief lull when both culture and civilisation began to deteriorate. The Tamil and Telugu territories recovered under the Vijayanagar Empire, founded in 1336. Following the empire's demise, the country was split amongst numerous sultans, polygars and European trading companies. Between 1685 and 1947, a number of kings ruled the areas that became part of the Madras Presidency.Thurston 1913, pp. 138‚Äì142.  Early English trading posts  On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I of England (1533‚Äì1603) granted a group of English merchants a charter to establish a joint-stock company which became known as the East India Company.Hunter, 1908, p. 6Wheeler 1996, p. 5Wheeler 1996, p. 6Wheeler 1996, p. 7 Subsequently, during the reign of King James I (1567‚Äì1625), Sir William Hawkins and Sir Thomas Roe were sent to negotiate with the Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1569‚Äì1627) to permit the establishment of trading factories in India on behalf of the Company. The first of these were built at Surat on the west coastWheeler 1996, p. 19 and at Masulipatam on the country's eastern seaboard.Wheeler 1996, p. 26 Masulipatam is thus the oldest English trading post on India's east coast, dating back to 1611. In 1625, another factory was established at Armagon, a few miles to the south, whereupon both the factories came under the supervision of an agency based at Machilipatam. The English authorities decided to relocate these factories further south, due to a shortage of cotton cloth, the main trade item of the east coast at the time. The problem was compounded when the Sultan of Golconda started harassing the local officers. The East India Company's administrator Francis Day (1605‚Äì73) was sent south, and after negotiations with the Raja of Chandragiri he obtained a land grant to set up a factory in the village of Madraspatnam, where the new Fort St George was built. An agency was created to govern the new settlement, and the factor Andrew Cogan of Masulipatnam was appointed as its first Agent.Roy 2012, p. 74 All the agencies along India's east coast were subordinated to the East India Company presidency of Bantam in Java.Chaudhuri 2006, p. 206 By 1641, Fort St George became the Company's headquarters on the Coromandel Coast.Thorpe 2011, p. 94  Agency of Fort St George  Andrew Cogan was succeeded by Francis Day (1643‚Äì1644), Thomas Ivie (1644‚Äì1648) and Thomas Greenhill (1648‚Äì52 and 1655‚Äì58). At the end of Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was elevated to a Presidency, independent of Bantam and under the leadership of the first president, Aaron Baker (1652‚Äì1655). However, in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat,Newell 1919, p. 18 until 1684. In 1658, control of all the factories in Bengal was given to Madras, when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane.Wheeler 1996, p. 281Wheeler 1996, p. 282  History  alt=two people standing next to each other in a historic setting  Expansion  In 1684, Fort St George was again elevated in rank to become the Madras Presidency, with William Gyfford as its first president.India Office List 1905, p. 121 The city came to be divided into two parts: the European inhabited White Town and the Black Town where the 'natives' lived. The White Town was confined inside the walls of Fort St. George and the Black Town outside of it. The Black Town later came to be known as George Town. During this period, the Presidency was significantly expanded and reached an extent which continued into the early 19th century. During the early years of the Madras Presidency, the English were repeatedly attacked by the Mughals, the Marathas and the Nawabs of Golkonda and the Carnatic region.Hunter 1908, p. 251 In September 1774, by Pitt's India Act, passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to unify and regulate the administration of the territories of the East India Company, the President of Madras was made subordinate to the Governor-General of India based in Calcutta.Kulke 2004, p. 245 In September 1746, Fort St George was captured by the French, who ruled Madras as a part of French India until 1749, when Madras was handed back to the British under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle of the previous year.Hunter 1908, p. 252  During the Company Raj  From 1774 until 1858, Madras was a part of British India and was ruled by the British East India Company. The last quarter of the 18th century was a period of rapid expansion. Successful wars against Tipu Sultan (1782‚Äì99), Velu Thampi, Polygars and Ceylon added vast areas of land and contributed to the exponential growth of the Presidency. Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798.Codrington 1926, Chapter X:Transition to British administration The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor- General of India (1798‚Äì1805) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George.Hunter 1908, p. 254 The hill tracts of Ganjam and Visakhapatnam were the last places to be annexed by the British.Hunter 1908, p. 255 The period also witnessed a number of rebellions starting with the 1806 Vellore Mutiny.Read 1997, pp. 34‚Äì37 The rebellion of Velu Thambi and Paliath Achan and the Poligar Wars were other notable insurrections against the British rule, but the Madras Presidency remained relatively undisturbed by the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.Dodd 1859, p. 288 The Madras Presidency annexed the kingdom of Mysore in 1831 on allegations of maladministrationKamath 1980, p. 250 and restored it to Chamaraja Wodeyar (1881‚Äì94), the grandson and heir of the deposed Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1799‚Äì1868) in 1881. Thanjavur was annexed in 1855, following the death of Shivaji II (1832‚Äì1855) who left no male heir.Kamath 1980, pp. 250‚Äì253  The Victorian era  In 1858, under the terms of Queen's Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the Madras Presidency, along with the rest of British India, came under the direct rule of the British crown.Hibbert 2000, p. 221 During the period of governor Lord Harris (1854‚Äì1859), measures were taken to improve education and increase representation of Indians in the administration. Legislative powers were given to the Governor's council under the Indian Councils Act 1861.Sadasivan 1974, p. 22 The council was reformed and expanded under the Indian Councils Act 1892,Sadasivan 1974, p. 40 the Indian Councils Act 1909,Sadasivan 1974, p. 54Sadasivan 1974, p. 55 the Government of India Act 1919, and the Government of India Act 1935. V. Sadagopacharlu (1861‚Äì63) was the first Indian to be appointed to the council.Muthiah 2004, p. 418 The legal profession was specially prized by the newly emerging corpus of educated Indians. In 1877, T. Muthuswamy Iyer became the first Indian judge of the Madras High Court despite strong opposition from the Anglo-Indian media.S.A. 1969, p. 14Tercentenary Madras Staff 1939, p. 223 He also acted as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court for a few months in 1893, thereby becoming the first Indian to hold the post.Pramanand 1985 In 1906, C. Sankaran Nair became the first Indian to be appointed Advocate-General of the Madras Presidency. A number of roads, railways, dams and canals were constructed during this period. Two large famines occurred in Madras during this period, the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 and the Indian famine of 1896‚Äì97.Dutt 1999, p. 10 As a result, the population of the Presidency fell for the first time from 31.2 million in 1871 to 30.8 million in 1881. These famines and alleged partiality shown by the government in handling the Chingleput Ryots' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population.  Indian Independence Movement  alt=an elderly woman seated in a chair A strong sense of national awakening emerged in the Madras Presidency in the later half of the 19th century. The first political organisation in the province, the Madras Native Association, was established by Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty on 26 February 1852.Sadasivan 1974, p. 18 However, the organisation did not last long.Sadasivan 1974, p. 28 The Madras Native Association was followed by the Madras Mahajana Sabha which was started on 16 May 1884. Of the 72 delegates who participated in the first session of the Indian National Congress at Bombay in December 1885, 22 hailed from the Madras Presidency.Mazumdar 1917, p. 58Mazumdar 1917, p. 59 Most of the delegates were members of the Madras Mahajana Sabha. The third session of the Indian National Congress was held in Madras in December 1887Besant 1915, p. 35 and was a huge success attended by 362 delegates from the province.Besant 1915, p. 36 Subsequent sessions of the Indian National Congress took place in Madras in 1894, 1898, 1903 1908, 1914 and 1927. Madam Blavatsky and Colonel H. S. Olcott moved the headquarters of the Theosophical Society to Adyar in 1882. The society's most prominent figure was Annie Besant, who founded the Home Rule League in 1916. The Home Rule Movement was organised from Madras and found extensive support in the Province. Nationalistic newspapers such as The Hindu, the Swadesamitran and the Mathrubhumi actively endorsed the campaign for independence. India's first trade union was established in Madras in 1918 by V. Kalyanasundaram and B. P. Wadia.Slater 1918, p. 168  Dyarchy (1920‚Äì37)  A dyarchy was created in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with provisions made for elections in the presidency.Ralhan 2002, p. 179 Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor's autocratic establishment. Following the first elections held in November 1920, the Justice Party, an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non-Brahmins in the administration, came to power.Ralhan 2002, p. 180 A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health and was replaced by P. Ramarayaningar, Minister of Local Self-Government and Public Health, popularly known as the Raja of Panagal.Ralhan 2002, p. 182 The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a splinter group allied with the opposition Swarajists. A motion of no-confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar's government on 27 November 1923, but was defeated 65‚Äì44. Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926. The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order (G.O. No. 613), which introduced caste-based communal reservations in government jobs, remains one of the high points of his rule. In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost. However, as no party was able to obtain a clear majority, the Governor, Lord Goschen, set up a cross-party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members.Ralhan 2002, p. 190 In the election of 1930, the Justice Party was victorious, and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister.Ralhan 2002, p. 196 The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again. Fearing a no-confidence motion against him, Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place.Ralhan 2002, p. 197 The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency.Ralhan 2002, p. 199 During the 1920s and 1930s, an Anti-Brahmin movement emerged in the Madras Presidency. It was launched by E. V. Ramaswamy who, unhappy with the principles and policies of the Brahmin leadership of the provincial Congress, left the party to form the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar, as he was alternatively known, criticised Brahmins, Hinduism, and Hindu superstitions in periodicals and newspapers such as Viduthalai and Justice. He also participated in the Vaikom satyagraha, which campaigned for the right of untouchables in Travancore to enter temples.W.B. 2005, pp. 3‚Äì8  Last days of British rule  alt=a person addressing a seated crowd In 1937, the Indian National Congress was elected to power in the Presidency of Madras for the first time. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister of the Presidency to come from the Congress party. He successfully enacted the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity ActThurston 1909, p. 116 and introduced both prohibitionBhakshi 1991, p. 149 and sales taxes in the Madras Presidency. His rule is largely remembered for the use of Hindi being made compulsory in educational institutions, a measure which made him highly unpopular as a politician and sparked widespread Anti-Hindi agitations, which led to violence in some places. Over 1,200 men, women, and children were jailed for their participation in such Anti-Hindi agitationsRamaswamy 1997, Chapter 4 while Thalamuthu and Natarasan died during the protests. In 1940, Congressional ministers resigned in protest over the Government of India's declaration of war on Germany without their consent. The Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Hope, took over the administration and the unpopular law was eventually repealed by him on 21 February 1940. Most Congressional leadership and erstwhile ministers were arrested in 1942, as a result of their participation in the Quit India movement.P. 2001, pp. 42‚Äì44 In 1944, Periyar renamed the Justice Party as Dravidar Kazhagam and withdrew it from electoral politics.W.B. 2005, p. 109 After the end of the Second World War, the Indian National Congress re-entered politics, and in the absence of any serious opposition it easily won the 1946 election. Tanguturi Prakasam was then elected as Chief Minister with the support of Kamaraj and served for eleven months. He was succeeded by O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar, who became the first Chief Minister of Madras state when India gained independence on 15 August 1947.Walch 1976, pp. 157‚Äì160 The Madras Presidency became the Madras State in independent India.  Geography  Madras province (North), 1909 Madras province (South), 1909 At its greatest extent, the Madras Presidency included much of southern India. Present-day territories that were once part of the presidency are the whole Indian State of Andhra Pradesh excluding the region of Banaganapalle Princely State, the Tondai Nadu, Kongu Nadu, Chola Nadu and part of Pandya Nadu regions of Tamil Nadu, the Malabar region of North Kerala, the Lakshadweep Islands, the Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Nabarangapur and Malkangiri districts of southern Odisha and the Bellary, Dakshina Kannada, and Udupi districts of Karnataka and the parts of Jayashankar Bhupalapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem districts of Telangana. The presidency had its winter capital at Madras and summer capital at Ootacamund.  Demographics  In 1822, the Madras Presidency underwent its first census, which returned a population of 13,476,923. A second census conducted between 1836 and 1837 recorded a population of 13,967,395, an increase of only 490,472 over 15 years. The first quinquennial population enumeration took place from 1851 until 1852. It returned a population of 22,031,697. Subsequent enumerations were made in 1851‚Äì52, 1856‚Äì57, 1861‚Äì62, and 1866‚Äì67. The population of Madras Presidency was tallied at 22,857,855, 24,656,509 in 1861‚Äì62 and 26,539,052 in 1866‚Äì67.MaClean 1877, p. 327 The first organised census of India was conducted in 1871 and returned a population of 31,220,973 for the Madras Presidency.Hunter, Volume 16, p. 256 Since then, a census has been conducted once every ten years. The last census of British India held in 1941 counted a population of 49,341,810 for the Madras Presidency.Steinberg 1950, p. 137  Languages  alt=map of a region The Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Odia, Tulu and English languages were all spoken in the Madras Presidency. Tamil was spoken in the southern districts of the Presidency from a few miles north of Madras city as far west as the Nilgiri hills and Western Ghats.Thurston 1913, p. 120 Telugu was spoken in the districts to the north of Madras city and to the east of Bellary and Anantapur districts. In the district of South Kanara, the western part of Bellary and Anantapur districts and parts of Malabar, Kannada was spoken.Thurston 1913, p. 121 Malayalam was spoken in the districts of Malabar and South Kanara and the princely states of Travancore and Cochin, while Tulu was spoken in South Canara. Oriya was spoken in the parts of the districts of then Ganjam and Vizagapatam. English was spoken by Anglo-Indians and Eurasians. It was also the link language for the Presidency and the official language of British India in which all government proceedings and court hearings were conducted.Mollin 2006, p. 17 According to the 1871 census, there were 14,715,000 people who spoke Tamil, 11,610,000 people who spoke Telugu, 2,324,000 people who spoke Malayalam, 1,699,000 spoke Canarese or Kannada, 640,000 people spoke Oriya and 29,400 people spoke Tulu.MaClean 1877, p. 6 The 1901 census returned 15,182,957 speakers of Tamil, 14,276,509 Telugu-speakers, 2,861,297 speakers of Malayalam, 1,518,579 were speakers of Kannada, 1,809,314 spoke Oriya, 880,145 spoke Hindusthani/Urdu and 1,680,635 spoke other languages.Hunter 1908, p. 260 At the time of Indian independence, Tamil and Telugu speakers made up over 78% of the total population of the presidency, with Kannada, Malayalam and Tulu speakers making up the rest.Steinberg 1950, p. 174  Religion  Vaishnavite Brahmin students at a Gurukulam in Tanjore, c. 1909|alt=a set of individuals, some in seated position Lord Ayyanar, c. 1911|alt=a shrine of a village temple Muslim (called in English at the time as alt=image of a standing boy in a religious costume In 1901, the population breakdown was: Hindus (37,026,471), Muslims (2,732,931), and Christians (1,934,480). By the time of India's independence in 1947, Madras had an estimated population of 49,799,822 Hindus, 3,896,452 Muslims and 2,047,478 ChristiansSteinberg 1950, p. 141 Hinduism was the predominant religion in the presidency and practised by around 88% of the population. The main Hindu denominations were Saivite, Vaishnavite and Lingayat.MaClean 1877, p. 337 Among the Brahmins, the Smartha doctrine was quite popular.T. 1765, p. 110 Worship of village gods was strong in the southern districts of the presidency while the mathas at Kanchi, Sringeri and Ahobilam were regarded as the centres of the Hindu faith. Of the Hindu temples, the largest and most important were the Venkateswara temple at Thirupathi, the Brihadeeswarar temple at Tanjore, the Meenakshi Amman temple at Madurai, the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, the Krishna temple at Udupi and the Padmanabhaswamy temple in the princely state of Travancore. Islam was brought to the southern part of India by Arab traders although most converts were made from the 14th century onwards, when Malik Kafur conquered Madurai. Nagore was the holiest city for the Muslims of the Madras Presidency. The presidency also had one of the oldest Christian populations in India. Branches of the Syrian church, contrary to historical evidence, are popularly believed to have been instituted by St. Thomas, an apostle of Jesus Christ who visited the Malabar coast in 52 ADThurston 1913, p. 137 Christians were mainly concentrated in the Tinnevely and Malabar districts of Madras Presidency with native Christians forming over one‚Äìquarter of the total population of the princely state of Travancore.Pirie 1883, p. 110 Hill tribes of the Nilgiris, Palani and Ganjam regions such as the Todas, Badagas, Kotas, Yerukalas and the Khonds, worshipped tribal gods and were often classified as Hindus. Until the early years of the 20th century, the Pallar, Paraiyar, Sakkiliar, Pulayar, Madiga, Izhava and Holeya Hindu communities were regarded as untouchable and were not allowed inside Hindu temples. However, along with the emancipation of Indian women and removal of social evils, untouchability was slowly eradicated through legislation and social reform. The Raja of Bobbili who served the Premier from 1932 to 1936, appointed untouchables to temple administration boards all over the presidency. In 1939, the Congress government of C. Rajagopalachari introduced the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act which removed all restrictions on untouchables entering Hindu temples. Chithira Thirunal of Travancore had issued a similar had earlier introduced similar legislation, the Temple Entry Proclamation at the advice of his Diwan, Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Ayyar, in 1937.Smith 1976, p. 42 In 1921 the Raja of Panagal's government passed the Hindu Religious Endowments BillRalhan 2002, p. 73 that established government-controlled trusts in the Madras Presidency to manage Hindu temples and prevent potential misuse of their funds. The Raja of Bobbili also introduced reforms in the administration of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, the trust which manages the Hindu temple at Tirupathi.  Administration  The Pitt's India Act of 1784 created an executive council with legislative powers to assist the Governor. The council initially consisted of four members, two of whom were from the Indian civil service or covenanted civil service and the third, an Indian of distinction.Thurston 1913, p. 181 The fourth was the Commander-in-chief of the Madras Army.Thurston 1913, p. 182 The council was reduced to three members when the Madras Army was abolished in 1895. The legislative powers of this council were withdrawn as per the Government of India Act 1833 and it was reduced to the status of a mere advisory body.Sadasivan 1974, p. 17 However, these powers were restored as per Indian Councils Act 1861. The council was expanded from time to time through the inclusion of official and non-official members and served as the main legislative body till 1935, when a legislative assembly of a more representative nature was created and legislative powers were transferred to the assembly. On India's independence on 15 August 1947, the three-member Governor's executive council was abolished. The origins of Madras Presidency lay in the village of Madraspatnam which was obtained in 1640.MaClean 1877, p. 21 This was followed by Fort St David which was acquired in 1690. Chingleput district, known as the \\"jaghire\\" of Chingleput, obtained in 1763, was the first district in the Madras Presidency. Salem and Malabar districts were obtained from Tipu Sultan in 1792 as per the Treaty of Seringapatam and Coimbatore and Kanara districts after the Fourth Mysore War in 1799.MaClean 1877, p. 22 The territories of the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom were constituted as a separate district in 1799. In 1800, the districts of Bellary and Cuddapah were created out of the territory ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1801, the districts of North Arcot, South Arcot, Nellore, Trichinopoly, Madura and Tinnevely were created out of the territories of the erstwhile Carnatic kingdom. Trichinopoly district was made a sub-division of Tanjore district in June 1805 and remained so till August 1808 when its status as a separate district was restored. The districts of Rajahmundry(Rajamahendravaram), Masulipatnam and Guntur were created in 1823.MaClean 1877, p. 20 These three districts were reorganised in 1859 into two ‚Äì the Godavari and Krishna districts. Godavari district was further bifurcated into East and West Godavari districts in 1925. The Kurnool kingdom was annexed in 1839 and was constituted as a separate district of the Madras Presidency. For administrative convenience, the district of Kanara was split into North and South Kanara in 1859. North Kanara was transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862. Between 1859‚Äì60 and 1870, the districts of Madras and Chingleput were put together into a single district. A separate Nilgiris district was carved out of Coimbatore district in 1868. As of 1908, Madras Presidency was made up of 24 districts each administered by a District Collector who was from the Indian Civil Service. The districts were sometimes sub-divided into divisions each under a Deputy Collector. The divisions were further sub-divided into taluks and union panchayats or village committees. Agencies were sometimes created in British India out of volatile, rebellion-prone areas of the Presidency. The two important agencies in the Madras Presidency were the Vizagapatam Hill Tracts Agency which was subject to the District Collector of Vizagapatam and the Ganjam Hill Tracts Agency subject to the District Collector of Ganjam. In 1936, the districts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam (including the Vizagapatam and the Ganjam agencies) were partitioned between Madras and the newly created province of Orissa. There were five princely states subordinate to the Madras government. They were Banganapalle, Cochin, Pudukkottai, Sandur, and Travancore.Thurston 1913, p. 1 All these states had a considerable degree of internal autonomy. However, their foreign policy was completely controlled by a Resident who represented the Governor of Fort St George.Thurston 1913, p. 183 In case of Banganapalle, the Resident was the District Collector of Kurnool, while the District Collector of BellaryMaClean 1877, p. 63 was the Resident of Sandur.MaClean 1877, p. 65 The Resident of Pudukkottai from 1800 to 1840 and 1865 to 1873, was the District Collector of Tanjore, from 1840 to 1865, the District Collector of Madura and from 1873 to 1947, the District Collector of Trichinopoly.Hunter 1908, p. 232  Army  alt=painting of a soldier The English East India Company was first permitted to set up its own garrison in 1665 to guard its settlements. Notable amongst the early operations of the Company's forces were the defence of the city from Mughal and Maratha invaders and from the incursions of the Nawab of Carnatic. In 1713, the Madras forces under Lieutenant John de Morgan distinguished themselves in the siege of Fort St David and in putting down Richard Raworth's Rebellion.Wheeler 1996, p. 198 When Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix, the Governor of French India, began to raise native battalions in 1748, the British of Madras followed suit and established the Madras Regiment.Major MacMunn 1911, p. 4 Though native regiments were subsequently established by the British in other parts of India, the distances that separated the three presidencies resulted in each force developing divergent principles and organisations. The first reorganisation of the army took place in 1795 when the Madras army was reconstituted into the following units: * European Infantry ‚Äì Two battalions of ten companies * Artillery ‚Äì Two European battalions of five companies each, with fifteen companies of lascars * Native Cavalry ‚Äì Four regiments * Native Infantry ‚Äì Eleven regiments of two battalionsMajor MacMunn 1911, p. 7 alt=painting of a soldier In 1824, a second reorganisation took place, whereupon the double battalions were abolished and the existing battalions were renumbered. The Madras Army at the time consisted of one European and one native brigade of horse artillery, three battalions of foot artillery of four companies each, with four companies of lascars attached, three regiments of light cavalry, two corps of pioneers, two battalions of European infantry, 52 battalions of native infantry and three local battalions.Major MacMunn 1911, p. 20Major MacMunn 1911, p. 21 Between 1748 and 1895, as with the Bengal and Bombay armies, the Madras Army had its own Commander-in-Chief who was subordinate to the president, and later to the Governor of Madras. By custom, the Commander-in-chief of the Madras Army was a member of the Governor's Executive Council. The army's troops participated in the conquest of Manila in 1762,Major MacMunn 1911, p. 14 the 1795 expeditions against Ceylon and the Dutch as well as the conquest of the Spice Islands in the same year. They also took part in expeditions against Mauritius (1810), Java (1811),Major MacMunn 1911, p. 15 the wars against Tipu Sultan and the Carnatic Wars of the 18th century, the British attack on Cuttack during the Second Anglo-Maratha War,Major MacMunn 1911, p. 57 the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny, and the invasion of Upper Burma during the Third Anglo-Burmese War.Major MacMunn 1911, p. 123 The 1857 Mutiny, which quickly led to drastic changes in the Bengal and Bombay armies, had no effect on the Madras Army. In 1895, the presidency armies were finally merged and the Madras regiments came under the direct control of the Commander-in-chief of British India.Major MacMunn 1911, p. 126 in 1890 three madras infantry battalions were accordingly reconstituted, at least for a time, by tapping two south Indian communities which had not yet provided many recruits to the Indian army-the Mappilas and the coorgs, the government of madras was sceptical, and agreed to the formation of two Mappila battalions only on condition they were deployed outside Malabar. Raised in 1900, the new regiments were complete failure, they soon dwindled to 600 men 'quite useless for service'. ref:The Sepoy and the Raj: The Indian Army, 1860-1940 The Sepoy and the Raj: The Indian Army, 1860-1940, Page:16  Land tenure  Sir Thomas Munro who introduced the \\"Ryotwari System\\" in the Madras Presidency|alt=statue of an individual seated in a horse Revenue from land rental as well as an income tax based on the tenant's net profits from their land was the presidency's main source of income. In ancient times, land appears to have been held in common with an individual unable to sell it without the consent of the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community.MaClean 1877, p. 82 Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India's west coastMaClean 1877, p. 85 such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor.MaClean 1877, p. 83 Nevertheless, landlords never sold land without the consent of other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate a certain amount of money known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non- interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages.MaClean 1877, p. 86 The proprietary system was entirely different in the district of Malabar and the states of Cochin and Travancore where communal ownership of land did not exist.MaClean 1877, p. 88 Instead, land was individual property mostly owned by the landowning gentry, to wit the Namboodiri and Nair people, who did not have to pay land-tax and held extensive freeholds of land rented to tenants for agricultural purposes. In return, the Nairs supplied the king with fighting men in times of war while the Namboodhiris managed the upkeep of Hindu temples. These landlords were somewhat self-sufficient and had their own police and judicial systems such that the personal expenses of the Raja were minimal. However, landlords lost their exemption from the taxes on land if they disposed of itMaClean 1877, p. 89 meaning that mortgage of land was more common than sale. Individual proprietorship of land was also common in the Telugu-speaking areas of the Presidency.MaClean 1877, p. 90 The chieftains of the Telugu-speaking districts had more or less maintained an independent existence for a long time, furnishing the sovereign with armies and equipment in times of war. In return, their right to revenues from land remained unmolested. During the time of the British, most of land in the northern districts of the Presidency were parcelled out among these petty \\"Rajahs\\". Islamic invasions caused minor changes in the land proprietorship system when taxes on Hindu land owners were raised and private ownership of property came down.MaClean 1877, p. 91 When the British took over administration, the centuries-old system of land proprietorship was left intact.MaClean 1877, p. 92 The new rulers appointed middlemen to collect revenue for lands which were not under the control of local zamindars. In most cases, these go-betweens ignored the welfare of the farmers and exploited them to the full. A Board of Revenue was established in 1786 to solve the issue but to no avail.MaClean 1877, p. 93 At the same time, the zamindari settlement established in Bengal by Lord Cornwallis proved highly successful and was later implemented in the Madras Presidency from 1799 onwards.MaClean 1877, p. 94 However, the Permanent Settlement was not as successful as it had been in Bengal. When the Company did not reach the expected profit levels, a new system known as the \\"Village Settlement\\" was implemented between 1804 and 1814 in the districts of Tinnevely, Trichinopoly, Coimbatore, North Arcot and South Arcot. This involved the leasing of land to the principal cultivators, who in turn leased the land to ryots, or peasant farmers. However, as a village settlement had few differences compared to a permanent settlement, it was eventually discarded. In its place came the \\"Ryotwari Settlement\\" implemented by Sir Thomas Munro between 1820 and 1827. According to the new system, land was handed over directly to the ryots who paid their rent directly to the government. The land was assessed and paid revenue fixed by the Government This system had a number of advantages as well as disadvantages for the ryots. In 1833, Lord William Bentinck implemented a new system called the \\"Mahalwari\\" or village system under which landlords as well as ryots entered into a contract with the Government.Ahmed 2011 pp. 392‚Äì4Rai 2011, p. 91 By the early 20th century, the greater part of the land was held by ryots who paid rent directly to the Government. Zamindari estates occupied about , more than one- quarter of the whole presidency. The peshkash, or tribute, payable to the government in perpetuity was about ¬£330,000 a year. Inams, revenue-free or quit-rent grants of lands made for religious endowments or for services rendered to the state, occupied an aggregate area of nearly . In 1945‚Äì46, there were of Zamindari estates yielding revenues of and of ryotwari lands which produced .Steinberg 1950, p. 154 Madras had forest coverage of .Steinberg 1950, p. 155 The Land Estates Act of 1908 was passed by the Madras Government in order to protect cultivators in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent occupants of the land.Thangaraj 2003, p. 287 However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidencyPatnaik 1997, p. 330 who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal serfdom. In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.  Agriculture and irrigation  alt=a map of a region Almost 71% of the population of Madras Presidency was engaged in agricultureThurston 1913, p. 193Hunter 1908, p. 276 with the agricultural year usually commencing on 1 July.Thurston 1913, p. 194 Crops cultivated in the Madras Presidency included cereals such as rice, corn, kambhu (Indian millet) and ragi as well asThurston 1913, p. 195 vegetables including brinjal, sweet potato, ladies' fingers, beans, onions, garlicThurston 1913, p. 196 and spices such as chilli, pepper and ginger along with vegetable oils made from castor beans and peanuts.Thurston 1913, p. 197 Fruits cultivated included lime, banana jackfruit, cashew nuts, mangos, custard apples and papayas.Thurston 1913, p. 199 In addition, cabbages, cauliflowers, pomelos, peaches, betel pepper, niger seed and millet were introduced from Asia, Africa or Europe, while grapes were introduced from Australia.Thurston 1913, p. 200 The total cultivated area used for food crops was 80% and for cash crops, 15%.Hunter 1908, p. 274 Of the gross area, rice occupied 26.4 percent; kambhu, 10 percent; ragi, 5.4 percent and Cholam, 13.8 percent. Cotton occupied , oilseeds, 2.08 million, spices,0.4 million and indigo, 0.2 million. In 1898, Madras produced 7.47 million tons of food grains from of crops grown on of ryotwari and inam lands, which supported a population of 28 million. The rice yield was 7 to 10 cwt. per acre, the cholam yields were 3.5 to 6.25 cwt. per acre, khambu, 3.25 to 5 cwt. per acre and ragi, 4.25 to 5 cwt. per acre. The average gross turnout for food crops was 6.93 cwt. per acre. The alt=image of a dam Irrigation along the east coast is carried out mostly by means of dams across rivers, lakes and irrigation tanks. The main source of water for agriculture in the Coimbatore district were tanks. The Land Improvement and Agriculturists Loan Act passed in 1884 provided funds for the construction of wells and their utilisation in reclamation projects.Hunter 1908, p. 278 In the early part of the 20th century, the Madras government established the Pumping and Boring Department to drill boreholes with electric pumps. The Mettur Dam,Gough 2008, p. 130 the Periyar Project, the Cudappah-Kurnool canal and the Rushikulya Project were the biggest irrigation projects launched by the Madras Government. Constructed below the Hogenakkal Falls on the Madras-Mysore border in 1934, the Mettur Dam supplied water to the western districts of the Presidency. The Periyar Dam (now known as the Mullaperiyar Dam) was constructed across the Periyar river in Travancore, near the border.Thurston 1913, p. 203 This project diverted the waters of the Periyar river to the Vaigai River basin in order to irrigate the arid lands to the east of the Western Ghats. Similarly, the Rushikulya Project was launched to utilise the waters of the Rushikulya river in Ganjam.Thurston 1913, p. 205 Under the scheme over of land were brought under irrigation. The British also constructed a number of dams and canals for irrigation. An upper dam was constructed across the Kollidam river near Srirangam island.Thurston 1913, p. 206 The Dowlaishwaram dam across the Godavari river, the Gunnavaram aqueduct across the Vaineteyam Godavari, the Kurnool-Cuddapah canal and the Krishna dam are examples of major irrigation works carried out by the British. In 1946‚Äì47, the total area under irrigation was acres which yielded a return of 6.94% on capital outlay.Steinberg 1950, p. 175  Trade, industry and commerce  The port of Tuticorin Textile showroom of M.

External trade made up 93 percent of the total with internal trade making up the remainder.Hunter 1908, p. 297 Foreign trade accounted for 70 percent of the total while 23 percent was inter- provincial. In 1900‚Äì01, imports from other provinces of British India amounted to 13.43 crores while exports to other provinces amounted to 11.52 crores. During the same year, exports to other countries reached 11.74 crores while imports were valued at 66.2 million.Hunter 1908, p. 354 At the time of India's independence, imports of the Presidency amounted to 71.32 crores a year while exports were valued at 645.1 million. Trade with the United Kingdom made up 31.54% of the total trade of the Presidency with Madras the chief port accounting for 49% of the total trade. Cotton piece-goods, cotton twist and yarn, metals and kerosene oil were the main items of import while animal hides and skins, raw cotton, coffee and piece-goods were the chief exports. Raw cotton, animal hides, oil seeds, grains, pulses, coffee, tea and cotton manufactures were the main items of sea trade.Thurston 1913, p. 43 Most of the sea trade was carried through the presidency's principal port of Madras. Other important ports were Gopalpur, Kalingapatnam, Bimlipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Masulipatnam, Cocanada, Madras, Cuddalore, Negapatam, Pamban and Tuticorin on the east coast along with Mangalore, Cannanore, Calicut, Cochin, Alleppey, Quilon(Coul√£o) and Colachel on the western seaboard.Thurston 1913, p. 36 The port of Cochin was taken over by the Government of India on 1 August 1936, and that of Madras on 1 April 1937. There were Chambers of Commerce in Madras, Cochin and Cocanada.Hunter 1908, p. 298 These chambers each nominated a member to the Madras Legislative Council. Cotton-ginning and weaving were two of the main industries in the Madras Presidency. Cotton was produced in large quantities in the Bellary district and was pressed in Georgetown, Madras.Thurston 1913, p. 208 The scarcity of cotton in Lancashire caused by a decline in trade due to the American Civil War gave an impetus to cotton and textile production and led to cotton presses being established all over the Presidency. In the early years of the 20th century, Coimbatore emerged as an important centre for cotton textiles and earned the epithet \\"Manchester of South India\\". The northern districts of Godavari, Vizagapatam and Kistna were well-known cotton-weaving centres. There was a sugar factory at Aska in Ganjam run by F. J. V. Minchin and another at Nellikuppam in South Arcot district run by the East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Company.Thurston 1913, p. 210 In the Telugu-speaking northern districts of the presidency large quantities of tobacco were cultivated to be subsequently rolled into cheroots.Thurston 1913, p. 211 Trichinopoly, Madras and Dindigul were the main cheroot-producing areas. Until the discovery of artificial aniline and alizarine dyes, Madras possessed a thriving vegetable dye manufacturing industry. The city also imported large quantities of aluminium for the manufacture of aluminium utensils.Thurston 1913, p. 212 In the early 20th century, the government established the Chrome Tanning Factory which manufactured high-quality leather.Thurston 1913, p. 213 The first brewery in the Presidency was founded in the Nilgiri Hills in 1826. Coffee was cultivated in the region of Wynad and the kingdoms of Coorg and MysoreThurston 1913, p. 214 while tea was grown on the slopes of the Nilgiri Hills.Thurston 1913, p. 216 Coffee plantations were also established in Travancore but a severe blight at the end of the 19th century destroyed coffee cultivation in the kingdom and almost wiped out coffee plantations in neighbouring Wynad. Coffee-curing works were located at Calicut, Mangalore and Coimbatore. In 1947, Madras had 3,761 factories with 276,586 operatives. The presidency's fishing industry thrived, with Shark's fins,Thurston 1913, p. 219 fish maws and fish curing- operationsThurston 1913, p. 220 the main sources of income for fishermen. The southern port of Tuticorin was a centre of conch-fishingThurston 1913, p. 223 but Madras, along with Ceylon, was mainly known for its pearl fisheries.Thurston 1913, p. 222 Pearl fisheries were harvested by the Paravas and was a lucrative profession. The total revenue of the Presidency was 57 crores in 1946‚Äì47 made as follows: Land revenue, 8.53 crores; Excise, 14.68 crores; Income tax, 4.48 crores; Stamp revenue, 4.38 crores; forests, 1.61 crores; other taxes, 8.45 crores; Extraordinary receipts, 2.36 crores and revenue fund, Rs.5.02 crores. Total expenditure for 1946‚Äì47 was 569.9 million. 208,675 k.v.a of electricity was generated at the end of 1948 of which 98% was under government ownership. The total amount of power generated was 467 million units. The Madras Stock Exchange was established in Madras city in 1920 with a strength of 100 members but gradually faded away and membership had reduced to three by 1923 when it had to be closed down.Muthiah 2004, p. 264 Nevertheless, the Madras Stock Exchange was successfully revived in September 1937 and was incorporated as the Madras Stock Exchange Association Limited. EID Parry, Binny and Co. and Arbuthnot Bank were the largest private- owned business corporations at the turn of the 20th century.Muthiah 2004, p. 261 EID Parry manufactured and sold chemical fertilizers and sugar while the Binnys marketed cotton garments and uniforms manufactured at its spinning and weaving facility, the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Otteri.Muthiah 2004, p. 262Muthiah 2004, p. 263 Arbuthnot, owned by the Arbuthnot family, was the largest bank in the Presidency until its crash in 1906.Muthiah 2004, p. 410 Reduced to penury, disillusioned former Indian investors established the Indian Bank with funds donated by Nattukottai Chetties.Muthiah 2004, p. 338Muthiah 2004, p. 339 Between 1913 and 1914, Madras had 247 companies.Sinha 2005, p. 44 In 1947, the city led in the establishment of registered factories but employed only 62% of the total productive capital. The first Western-style banking institution in India was the Madras Bank which was established on 21 June 1683, with a capital of one hundred thousand pounds sterling.Kumar 2003, p. 70 This was followed by the opening of the Carnatic Bank in 1788, the Bank of Madras in 1795 and the Asiatic Bank in 1804. In 1843, all the banks were merged to form the Bank of Madras. The Bank of Madras had branches in all the presidency's major cities and princely states including Coimbatore, Mangalore, Calicut, Alleppy, Cocanada, Guntur, Masulipatnam, Ootacamund, Negapataam, Tuticorin, Bangalore, Cochin and Colombo in Ceylon. In 1921, the Bank of Madras merged with the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Bengal to form the Imperial Bank of India.Kumar 2003, p. 71 In the 19th century, the Arbuthnot Bank was one of the largest privately owned banks in the Presidency. The City Union Bank, the Indian Bank, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank, Nadar Bank,Tercentenary Madras Staff 1939, p. 261 Karur Vysya Bank,Eur 2002, p. 498 Catholic Syrian Bank, Karnataka Bank, Bank of Chettinad,W.S. 1973, p. 43 Andhra Bank,B. 1998, p. 37 Vysya Bank, Vijaya Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and the Bank of Madura were some of the leading banks headquartered in the Presidency.  Transport and communication  Map of the Madras and South Mahratta Railway lines In the early days of the agency, the only means of transportation were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins.Thurston 1913, p. 185 The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation.Muthiah 2004, p. 323 Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus and motor services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway, an UNESCO World Heritage Site Pamban railway bridge, which connects the Pamban island with the Indian mainland was constructed in 1914 Malabar, c. 1913 The first organised initiative for the construction of new roads and maintenance of existing roads in the Presidency was initiated in 1845 with the appointment of a special officer for the maintenance of main roads.Mill 1996, p. 134 The principal roads under the aegis of the officer were the Madras-Bangalore road, Madras-Trichinopoly road, Madras-Calcutta road, Madras-Cuddapah road and the Sumpajee Ghaut road. A Public Works Department was initiated by Lord Dalhousie in 1852 and subsequently in 1855 an East coast canal was constructed for the purpose of easy navigation. Roadways were handled by the Public Works Secretariat which was under the control of the member of the Governor's Executive Council. The principal highways of the Presidency were the Madras-Calcutta road, the Madras-Travancore road and the Madras-Calicut road.Hunter 1908, p. 303 By 1946‚Äì47, the Madras Presidency had of metalled roads and of unmetalled roads, and of navigable canals. The first railway line in South India was laid between Madras and Arcot, which was opened for traffic on 1 July 1856.Muthiah 2004, p. 321 The line was constructed by the Madras Railway Company formed in 1845. The railway station at Royapuram, the first in South India, was built in 1853 and served as the headquarters of the Madras Railway Company. The Great Southern Indian Railway Company was set up in the United Kingdom in 1853. and had its headquarters at Trichinopoly where it constructed its first railway line between Trichinopoly and Negapatam in 1859. The Madras Railway Company operated standard or broad-gauge railway lines while the Great South Indian Railway Company operated metre-gauge railway lines.Hunter 1908, p. 301 In 1874, The Great Southern Indian Railway Company merged with the Carnatic Railway Company (established in 1864) and was renamed the Southern Indian Railway Company.Muthiah 2004, p. 322 The Southern Indian Railway Company merged with the Pondicherry Railway Company in 1891 while the Madras Railway Company merged with the Southern Mahratta Railway Company in 1908 to form the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company. A new terminus was built at Egmore for the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company. In 1927, the South Indian Railway Company shifted its headquarters from Madurai to Chennai Central. The company operated a suburban electric train service for Madras city from May 1931 onwards. In April 1944, the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company was taken over by the Madras Government. In 1947, there were of railway in the Presidency, in addition to of district board lines. Madras was well-connected with other Indian cities like Bombay and Calcutta and with Ceylon.Christophers 1927, p. 14 The Pamban railway bridge connecting Mandapam on the Indian mainland with Pamban island was opened for traffic in 1914. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was inaugurated between Mettupalayam and Ootacamund in 1899. The Madras Tramways Corporation was promoted in Madras city in 1892 by Hutchinsons and Co. and began operating in 1895, before even London had its own tramway system. It plied six routes in Madras linking distant parts of Madras city and covered a total of . The chief navigable waterways in the presidency were the canals in the Godavari and the Kistna deltas. The Buckingham canal was cut in 1806 at a cost of 90 lakhs of silverHunter 1908, p. 304 to connect the city of Madras with the delta of the Kistna river at Peddaganjam. Ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company frequently docked at Madras and provided frequent services to Bombay, Calcutta, Colombo and Rangoon. In 1917, Simpson and Co. arranged for a test flight by the first aeroplane in Madras while a flying club was established at the Mount Golf Club grounds near St Thomas Mount by a pilot named G. Vlasto in October 1929.Muthiah 2004, p. 127 This site was later used as the Madras aerodrome. One of the early members of the club, Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar went on to establish an aerodrome in his native Chettinad. On 15 October 1932, Royal Air Force pilot Nevill Vintcent piloted J. R. D. Tata's plane carrying air-mail from Bombay to Madras via Bellary. This was the beginning of Tata Sons' regular domestic passenger and airmail service from Karachi to Madras. The flight was later re-routed through Hyderabad and became bi-weekly. On 26 November 1935, Tata Sons started an experimental weekly service from Bombay to Trivandrum via Goa and Cannanore. From 28 February 1938, onwards, Tata Sons' Aviation division, now renamed Tata Airlines, began a Karachi to Colombo airmail service via Madras and Trichinopoly. On 2 March 1938, the Bombay- Trivandrum air service was extended to Trichinopoly. The first organised postal service was established between Madras and Calcutta by Governor Edward Harrison in 1712. After reform and regularisation, a new postal system was started by Sir Archibald Campbell and was introduced on 1 June 1786. The Presidency was divided into three postal divisions: Madras North up to Ganjam, Madras South-West to Anjengo (erstwhile Travancore) and Madras West, up to Vellore. In the same year, a link with Bombay was established then in 1837, the Madras, Bombay and Calcutta mail services were integrated to form the All- India Service. On 1 October 1854, the first stamps were issued by the Imperial Postal Service. The General Post Office (GPO), Madras, was established by Sir Archibald Campbell in 1786. In 1872‚Äì73, a bimonthly sea-mail service began between Madras and Rangoon. This was followed by the commencement of a fortnightly sea-mail service between Madras and ports on the eastern coast. Madras was linked to the rest of the world through telegraphs in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855. Soon afterwards, telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India. A Telegraph department was set up in 1854, with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city. The Colombo-Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon.Wright 1999, p. 207 Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras.Muthiah 2004, p. 54 A wireless telegraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.  Education  The first schools offering Western-style education in the presidency were established in MadrasHunter 1908, p. 383 during the 18th century. In 1822, a Board of Public Instruction was created based on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Munro, after which schools teaching students in vernacular language was established.Hunter 1908, p. 338 A central training school was set up in Madras as per Munro's scheme. However, this system appeared to be a failure and the policy was altered in 1836 in order to promote European literature and science. The Board of Public Instruction was superseded by a Committee for Native Education.Hunter 1908, p. 339 In January 1840, during the viceroyalty of Lord Ellenborough, a University Board was established with Alexander J. Arbuthnot as the Joint Director of Public Instruction. The central school was converted to a high school in April 1841 with 67 students and in 1853 became the Presidency College with the addition of a college department. On 5 September 1857, the University of Madras was established as an examining body using the University of London as a model with the first examinations held in February 1858. C. W. Thamotharam Pillai and Caroll V. Visvanatha Pillai of Ceylon were the first to graduate from the University. Sir S. Subramaniya Iyer was the first Indian Vice-Chancellor of the University. Similarly, Andhra University was established by the Andhra University Act of 1925Ralhan 2002, p. 74 and in 1937, the University of Travancore was established in the princely state of Travancore. The Government Arts College, established in Kumbakonam in 1867, was one of the first educational institutions outside Madras.Craik 2007, p. 260 The oldest engineering college in the presidency, College of Engineering, Guindy, was established as a Government Survey School in 1794 before being upgraded to an Engineering College in 1861.Muthiah 2004, p. 239 Initially, only Civil Engineering was taught, with the further disciplines of Mechanical Engineering added in 1894, Electrical Engineering in 1930 and Telecommunication and Highways in 1945.Muthiah 2004, p. 240 The AC College, with its emphasis on textiles and leather technology, was founded by Alagappa Chettiar in 1944.Muthiah 2004, p. 241 The Madras Institute of Technology, which introduced courses such as aeronautical and automobile engineering was established in 1949. In 1827, the first medical school in the Presidency was established then followed by the Madras Medical College in 1835.Christophers 1927, p. 41 The Government Teacher's College was established at Saidapet in 1856.Hunter 1908, p. 343 Among the private institutions, the Pachaiyappa's College, established in 1842, is the oldest Hindu educational institution in the presidency. The Annamalai University, established by Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar in Chidambaram in 1929, was the first university in the presidency to have hostel facilities Christian missionaries were pioneers in promoting education in the region. The Madras Christian College, St. Aloysius College at Mangalore, Loyola College in Madras and the St. Peter's College at Tanjore were some of the educational institutions established by Christian missionaries. The Madras Presidency had the highest literacy rate of all the provinces in British India.Seal 1971, p. 103 In 1901, Madras had a male literacy rate of 11.9 percent and a female literacy rate of 0.9 percent.Hunter 1908, p. 345 In 1950, when the Madras Presidency became Madras State, the literacy rate was slightly higher than the national average of 18 percent.K. Mehrotra 2006, p. 23 In 1901, there were 26,771 public and private institutions with 923,760 scholars of whom 784,621 were male and 139,139 female.Hunter 1908, p. 361 By 1947, the number of educational institutions had increased to 37,811 and the number of scholars to 3,989,686. Apart from colleges, in 1947 there were 31,975 public and elementary schools, 720 secondary schools for boys and 4,173 elementary and 181 secondary schools for girls. Most of the early graduates were Brahmins. The preponderance of Brahmins in the universities and in the civic administration was one of the main causes for the growth of the Anti-Brahmin movement in the presidency. Madras was also the first province in British India where caste-based communal reservations were introduced. In 1923, the Madras University Act was passed after its introduction by Education Minister A. P. Patro. Under the bill's provisions, the governing body of Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines. The bill asserted that the governing body would henceforth be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor, usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, there was to be a Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor.  Culture and society  Hindus, Muslims and Christians generally followed a joint family system.Finnemore 1917, p. 62Srinivas 1982, p. 69 The society was largely patriarchal with the eldest male member the leader of the family. Most of the presidency followed a patrilineal system of inheritance.Agarwal 1994, p. 472 The only exceptions were the district of Malabar and the princely states of Travancore and Cochin which practised the marumakkathayam system.B√∂ck 2000, p. 177 Women were expected to confine themselves to indoor activities and the maintenance of the household. Muslims and high-caste Hindu women observed purdah. The daughter in the family rarely received an education and usually helped her mother with household chores.Finnemore 1917, p. 22 Upon marrying, she moved to the house of her in-laws where she was expected to serve her husband and the elder members of his family.Finnemore 1917, p. 63Finnemore 1917, p. 64 There have been recorded instances of torture and ill treatment of daughters-in-law. A Brahmin widow was expected to shave her head and was subjected to numerous indignities.Finnemore 1917, p. 65Finnemore 1917, p. 66 Rural society comprised villages where people of different communities lived together. Brahmins lived in separate streets called agraharams. Untouchables lived outside village limits in small hamlets called cheris and were strictly forbidden from having houses in the village.Thurston 1909, p. 87 They were also forbidden from entering important Hindu temples or approaching high-caste Hindus.Thurston 1909, p. 78Thurston 1909, p. 79 Serfdom was practised in almost all castes from Brahmins to non-Brahmins subjecting agricultural labourers to bondage for non-payment of debt.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 5 The Law Commission report on slavery in 1841 contains the indicative figures on the number of slaves, computed based on the population of specific castes of Pallar and Paraiyar.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 4 There were proposed regulations in 1811 and 1823 to prevent child labour.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 27 In 1833, the British Crown and the House of Commons proposed immediate abolotion of slavery in India, but East India Company decreed otherwise.Price 1837, p. 154 All legal recognition to permit the civil status of slavery were withdrawn with the Act V of 1843 and selling of slaves became a criminal offence in 1862 under the new Indian Penal Code.Chatterjee 2006, p. 231 In spite of these regulations, serfdom continued and the slave population formed 12.2%20% of the total population in 1930 across various districts of the Presidency.Kumar 1965 pp. 52‚Äì53 The Malabar Marriage Act of 1896 recognised sambandham contracts as legal marriages while the marmakkathayam system was abolished by the Marmakkathayam Law of 1933.P.V. 1981, p. 21 Numerous measures were taken to improve the lot of Dalit outcasts. The Thirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams Act (1933), included Dalits in the devasthanams administration. The presidemcy's Temple Entry Authorization Act (1939) and its Temple Entry Proclamation (1936) of Travancore were aimed at elevating the status of Dalit and other low castes to a position equal to that of high-caste Hindus. In 1872, T. Muthuswamy Iyer established the Widow Remarriage Association in Madras and advocated the remarriage of Brahmin widows.Anantha Raman 2005, p. 87 The devadasi system was regulated in 1927 and completely abolished on 26 November 1947. The Widow Remarriage movement was spearheaded in the Godavari district by Kandukuri Veeresalingam.Roy 2002, p. 213. Most of the pioneers of social reform were Indian nationalists.Desai 2005, p. 224.Deol 2000, p. 26. Traditional pastimes and forms of recreation in rural areas were cock-fighting, bull-fighting, village fairs and plays.Finnemore 1917, pp. 35‚Äì41 Men in urban areas indulged in social and communistic activities at recreational clubs, music concerts or sabhas, dramas and welfare organisations. Carnatic music and bharatanatyam were especially patronised by the upper and upper-middle class Madras society. Of the sports introduced by the British in the presidency, cricket, tennis, football and hockey were the most popular. An annual cricket tournament, known as the Madras Presidency Matches, was held between Indians and Europeans during Pongal.Muthiah 2004, p. 173 The presidency's first newspaper, the Madras Courier, was started on 12 October 1785, by Richard Johnston, a printer employed by the British East India Company.Muthiah 2004, p. 50 The first Indian-owned English-language newspaper was The Madras Crescent which was established by freedom-fighter Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty in October 1844.Muthiah 2004, p. 53 Lakshminarasu Chetty is also credited with the foundation of the Madras Presidency Association which was a forerunner of the Indian National Congress. The number of newspapers and periodicals published in the presidency totalled 821 in 1948. The two most popular English-language newspapers were The Hindu established by G. Subramania Iyer in 1878, and The Mail, established as the Madras Times by the Gantz family in 1868.Muthiah 2004, p. 51 Regular radio service in the presidency commenced in 1938 when All India Radio established a station in Madras.Muthiah 2004, p. 164 Cinemas became popular in the 1930s and 1940s with the first film in a South Indian language, R. Nataraja Mudaliar's Tamil film Keechaka Vadham, released in 1916. The first sound films in Tamil and Telugu were made in 1931 while the first Kannada talkie Sati Sulochana was made in 1934 and the first Malayalam talkie Balan in 1938. There were film studios at Coimbatore, Salem, Madras and Karaikudi. Most early films were made in Coimbatore and Salem but from the 1940s onwards, Madras began to emerge as the principal centre of film production. Until the 1950s, most films in Telugu,Thoraval 2000, p. 345 KannadaIshizuka 2008, p. 174 and MalayalamKasbekar 2006, p. 233 were made in Madras.

History The AFL-CIO established the Solidarity Center in 1997. The Solidarity Center was created through the consolidation of four labor institutes: the American Institute for Free Labor Development, the Asian-American Free Labor Institute, the African- American Labor Institute, and the Free Trade Union Institute. The pre-existing institutes were merged by John Sweeney shortly after he became president of the AFL‚ÄìCIO. The AFL-CIO had worked internationally for many decades.

US Navy service Operating from New London, Connecticut, in 1923, S-25 participated in winter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea and Panama Canal Zone area from January into April 1924. Then transferred to the West Coast, she operated primarily in the waters off southern California into 1931. Fleet problems and division exercises during that period took her back to Panama from March into May 1927 and in February 1929 and to Hawaii in 1927, 1928, and 1930. Transferred again, she sailed from San Diego, California, on 15 April 1931; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 April; and from then into 1939 operated in Hawaiian waters. S-25 cleared Pearl Harbor to return to the Atlantic Ocean on 16 June of that year and arrived at New London on 25 August. Voyage repairs followed and in February 1940, she was assigned to a test and evaluation division there. In December, she was detached and ordered to Key West, Florida, where she provided training services into May 1941, then returned to New London to prepare for transfer under the terms of the lend-lease agreement. Polish Navy service S-25 was decommissioned on 4 November 1941 and simultaneously transferred to United Kingdom where she was renamed . She was then loaned to the government of Poland in exile, accepted by Lieutenant Commander B. Romanowski of the Polish Navy, and commissioned as ORP JastrzƒÖb.

Later, he was joined by Dr. Ashok Ambastha in 1983 and subsequently by many others at different stages who have continued further contributing to the growth of this observatory. Telescopes Utilizing a variety of telescopes, USO is known for its solar observations, which include high-resolution solar chromospheric, magnetic field, velocity, and spectral observations, for studies pertaining to solar flares, mass ejections, and the evolution of solar active regions. USO fills the large longitudinal gap between Australia and Spain, and provides a link for continuous solar coverage in international collaborative programs, including the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG).

(trading publicly as Royal Delft) is a Dutch manufacturer of Delft Blue earthenware, headquartered in Delft, the Netherlands. It is the only remaining factory out of 32 that were established in Delft during the 17th century. Today, the company has been active for over 360 years without interruption.http://www.royaldelft.com/english/about-royal- delft/facts-and-figures.html  History  During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch East India Company had a lively trade with the East and imported millions of pieces of Chinese porcelain in the early 17th century.Volker, T. Porcelain and the Dutch East India Company, 1602‚Äì1683, Leiden, 1955) p. 22. Exotic blue-and-white designs from China were particularly prized by Dutch and European elites. The decline of the Ming Dynasty following the death of the Wanli Emperor negatively impacted Sino-Dutch trade, including earthenware, to the extent that Dutch merchants decided the only solution was to produce such objects locally. One such manufacturer was David Anthonisz van der Pieth, who founded De Porceleyne Fles (\\"the Porcelain Bottle\\") in 1653. From then until the late 18th century, the company produced earthenware for clients around the Netherlands and Europe. Delftware ranged from simple household items ‚Äì plain white earthenware with little or no decoration ‚Äì to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with windmills and fishing boats, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. Competition from the European porcelain industry, however, was fierce and by 1840, De Porceleyne Fles was the last factory remaining, all other competitors having ceased operations. In 1876, Joost Thooft bought the factory with the aim to revive the production of Delftware. Together with Leo Senf, he worked to modernise operations and produce products that would be able to compete with European manufacturers. Thooft developed the trademark that is applied to all hand-painted Royal Delft items. After Thooft's death in 1890, owner Abel Labouchere helmed the company, overseeing the centralisation of production from dispersed locations around the city to the current factory location in 1916. In 1919, the Dutch royal house awarded the company the right to add the prefix Koninklijke (Royal) to its name, a sign of appreciation for the company's efforts to preserve an important Dutch industry. To this day, the company maintains a close relation with the Dutch Royal Family.

He graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) where he was a student of Ritwik Ghatak and later became a teacher. Starting his career with Uski Roti (1969), which won him the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie, he went on to win four of them in all. He won the National Film Award for Best Direction in 1974 for Duvidha and later the National Film Award for his documentary film Siddheshwari in 1989. Early life and background Born Rabindranath Kaul, in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in a Kashmiri Pandit family, Kaul first joined FTII, Pune as an acting student and later shifted to the direction course, where noted film director Ritwik Ghatak was a teacher, graduating in 1966. He was a nephew of actor-director Mahesh Kaul, who made films like Raj Kapoor starrer Sapno Ka Saudagar (1968). Career His first film Uski Roti (1969) has been described as \\"one of the key films of the New Indian Cinema or the Indian New Wave\\". It marked a drastic departure from earlier Indian cinema technique, form and narrative. It was one of the early formal experimental films in Indian cinema. Ashadh Ka Ek Din (1971), his next film, was based on a play by Mohan Rakesh. Duvidha, his third film, was his first in colour. It grew out of a short story by Vijaydan Detha and tells the story of a merchant's son, who returns with his new bride. When he departs on a business trip, a ghost falls in love with the wife. It was widely shown across Europe. He was awarded the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1974. Kaul was one of the co-founders of the Yukt Film Co-operative (Union of Kinematograph Technicians) in 1976, leading to avant-garde films. Critics opined in \\"Mani Kaul's cinematic conception, fiction and documentary films have no clear demarcated dividing line.\\" He also taught music in the Netherlands, and was Creative Director of the film house at Osian's Connoisseurs of Art, Mumbai. In 1971, he was a member of the jury at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. He was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University for the 2000‚Äì2001 school year. Death Mani Kaul died on 6 July 2011 at his home in Gurgaon, near Delhi, after prolonged battle with cancer. He is survived by two sons and two daughters. Tribute According to a tribute from Prabha Mahajan on the Indian documentary film discussion network Docuwallahs2 , Mani Kaul's significant body of work included both feature films and documentaries. In an interview Mani stated: \\"The dividing line from my films and documentaries is thin. Some of my films like Siddheshwari are like poetic documentaries.\\" Mani Kaul's fellow alumni from FTII intend to put together a collective tribute to Mani Kaul and his work, and interested persons were invited to send in their thoughts on Mani as a film maker, teacher/ mentor, colleague, and as a person. Indian film critic Khalid Mohamed commented, \\"As a film director, he discussed the status of women (Uski Roti, Duvidha), crafted visually seductive documentaries (Arrival, Before My Eyes, A Desert of a Thousand Lines) and went through a spell of interpreting Fyodor Dostoevsky‚Äôs masterworks. The Russian writer‚Äôs short story A Gentle Creature inspired Nazar, shot in low, chiaroscuro lighting.\\" Filmmaker Sameer Wadhwa,in his obituary of Mani Kaul published in Hindustan Times writes: ‚ÄúMani Kaul had perfected the art of deeply moving his audience cerebrally by meticulous philosophical exposition. His films effortlessly employed temporality to create a deep spatial landscape in which human emotions oscillated with an incendiary provocation. This cinematic gesture was so subtle that if one were not attentive the meaning would be lost.‚Äù Filmography *Uski Roti (1969) *Ashadh Ka Ek Din (1971) *Duvidha (1973) *Puppeteers of Rajasthan (Documentary) (1974) *A Historical Sketch of Indian Women (Documentary) (1975) *Ghashiram Kotwal (1976) *Chitrakathi (Documentary) (1977) *Arrival (Documentary) (1980) *Satah Se Uthata Admi (1980)Satah Se Uthata Admi at Cannes Cannes Film Festival *Dhrupad (1982) *Mati Manas (Documentary) (1984) *A Desert of a Thousand Lines (Documentary) (1986) *Before My Eyes (Documentary)(1989) *Siddheshwari (Documentary) (1989) *Nazar (1991) *Idiot (1992) *The Cloud Door (1995) *Naukar Ki Kameez (The Servant's Shirt) (1999)Mani Kaul Filmography New York Times. *Bojh (Burden) (2000) *Ik Ben Geen Ander (I Am No Other) Nederland (2002) *A Monkey's Raincoat Nederland (2005) *Signature Film for Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema (2006) Awards National Film Awards * 1974: Best Direction: Duvidha * 1989: Best Documentary Film: SiddheshwariInterview with Mani Kaul UNESCO Courier, July‚ÄìAugust 1995.

Kenney edited the magazine and wrote much of its early material.MarksVeryLage.com (fan site). He would go on to write, produce, and perform in the influential comedies Animal House and Caddyshack before his untimely death. Early life Kenney was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, the son of Estelle \\"Stephanie\\" (Karczewski) and Daniel \\"Harry\\" Kenney. Kenney was of Irish and Eastern European descent. He was named for General Douglas MacArthur. His family moved to Mentor, Ohio in the early 1950s, before settling in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Kenney lived in Chagrin Falls from 1958-1964 and attended Gilmour Academy, a Catholic prep high school for boys in nearby Gates Mills, Ohio. He was married to Alexandra Appleton Garcia-Mata. Career National Lampoon While at Harvard University, Kenney was a member of the Signet society, president of the Spee Club, and editor of The Harvard Lampoon. He decided once he got to college, he was going to re-invent himself as an all-around golden boy. There, he was part of the first group of newcomers who restyled the college humor magazine. Another of these writers was Henry Beard, with whom Kenney frequently collaborated, and who became a lifelong friend. Together with Beard, he wrote the short novel Bored of the Rings, which was published during 1969. Kenney graduated in 1968. Soon after, he, Beard and fellow Harvard alumnus Robert Hoffman began work on founding the humor magazine National Lampoon. Doug found it hard to find a major, something he wanted to do in life. The only thing he seemed to enjoy and be talented at was writing for the college magazine. So he suggested to Beard they create a mainstream professional worldwide syndicated magazine with themselves as the headmasters. Kenney was one of the originating forces of what was to become known during the 1970s as the \\"new wave\\" of comedy: a dark, irreverent style of humor Kenney used as the basis for the magazine. Kenney was Editor-in-Chief from 1970 to 1972, Senior Editor 1973 to 1974, and Editor from 1975 to 1976. Thomas Carney, writing in New Times, traced the history and style of the National Lampoon and the impact it had on comedy's new wave. \\"The National Lampoon,\\" Carney wrote, \\"was the first full-blown appearance of non-Jewish humor in years--not anti-Semitic, just non-Jewish. Its roots were W.A.S.P. and Irish Catholic, with a weird strain of Canadian detachment. . . . This was not Jewish street-smart humor as a defense mechanism; this was slash-and-burn stuff that alternated in pitch but moved very much on the offensive. It was always disrespect everything, mostly yourself, a sort of reverse deism.\\" Kenney wrote much of the Lampoon's early material, such as \\"Mrs. Agnew's Diary\\", a regular column written as the diary of Spiro Agnew (or \\"Spiggy\\")'s wife, chronicling her life amongst Richard Nixon and other famous politicians. The feature was an Americanized version of Private Eye's long-running column \\"Mrs. Wilson's Diary,\\" written from the viewpoint of Prime Minister Harold Wilson's wife. To escape the pressures of running a successful magazine, Kenney sometimes took unannounced extended breaks, although, despite these absences, \\"Mrs. Agnew's Diary\\" was always submitted to the Lampoon. During one of these breaks he wrote a comic novel, \\"Teenage Commies from Outer Space\\". Kenney threw the manuscript in a bin after a negative review from Beard. Beard later said that it was simply the wrong form and the spirit of the novel was channeled into National Lampoon's 1964 High School Yearbook, which Kenney co- wrote with P. J. O'Rourke. Kenney had a five-year buyout contract with the Lampoons publisher, 21st Century Communications. Kenney, Beard, and Hoffman took advantage of this, dividing a sum of $7 million amongst them. Kenney remained on staff until 1977, when he left the magazine to co-write the screenplay to National Lampoon's Animal House, along with Chris Miller and Harold Ramis. Kenney had a small role in Animal House as Delta fraternity brother \\"Stork\\", with only two lines of dialogue. Stork's key scene is in the big parade climax, when he sabotages the drum major and leads the marching band down the alley. We see him and fellow co-writer Chris Miller as Hardbar in the same shot during the coup. Kenney hand-selected this role for himself as it was a role he seemed most like. Most of Kenney's friends said such a role did not surprise them. Produced on a very modest budget, National Lampoon's Animal House was, until Ghostbusters in 1984, the most profitable comedy film in Hollywood history. Caddyshack Kenney produced and wrote Caddyshack with Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis. Kenney also had a small role in Caddyshack as a dinner guest of Al Czervik. In the background of the Bushwood Club dinner party scene, Kenney is visible chopping out a line of cocaine for the female guest next to him. And he is seen dancing with her. The film did not come out the way it was written. The film was intended to be about the caddies and their attitude towards the club's members and government. But the studio edited it to focus on the scene-stealers Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Ted Knight. Kenney and the writers were unhappy with the final released version. When Caddyshack opened to negative reviews in July 1980, Kenney became deeply depressed, though Ramis joked that the film was \\"a six-million-dollar scholarship to film school.\\" At a press conference, Kenney verbally abused reporters and then fell into a drunken stupor. Concerned, friends began asking Kenney to seek professional help, but by that time he was out of control, joking about previous suicide attempts, driving recklessly, and using increasing amounts of cocaine. He decided to stay with some friends of his. He played games with them and participated in their daily activities, playing the part of therapist. He even referred to both of them as \\"mom and dad\\" during his stay. Death After the incident at the Caddyshack press conference, it became apparent that Kenney had a substance abuse problem. Kenney's close friend Chevy Chase took him to Kauai, Hawaii, hoping the relaxing environment would help him, but had to leave to return to work. After Chase left, Kenney's girlfriend, Kathryn Walker, came to keep him company, but she also had to return to work. Kenney had called Chase and invited him back. Chase was preparing to return to Hawaii when he received a telephone call telling him that his friend was missing. Kenney died on August 27, 1980, aged 33, after falling from a 35-foot cliff called the Hanapepe Lookout. Police found his abandoned car the following day; three days later, Kenney's body was discovered stuck between two jagged rocks at the bottom of the cliff. His death was classified as accidental by Kauai police. According to Anne Beatts, upon Kenney's death, Chris Miller said \\"Doug was looking for a better place to jump from, while he slipped\\". Found in Kenney's hotel room were notes for projects he had been planning, jokes, and an outline for a new movie. \\"We also found,\\" Chevy Chase told Rolling Stone magazine, \\"written on the back of a hotel receipt, a bunch of random thoughts that included the reasons why he loved Kathryn\\". A gag line that he had left was found: \\"These last few days are among the happiest I've ever ignored.\\" National Lampoon's tribute to him was an editorial by Matty Simmons and a cartoon showing a sign next to the edge of a cliff with the inscription, \\"Doug Kenney Slipped Here.\\" Legacy Kenney received a nomination from The Writers Guild of America for his National Lampoon's Animal House screenplay (along with Harold Ramis and Chris Miller). The June 1985 issue of National Lampoon, titled \\"The Doug Kenney Collection\\", was entirely dedicated to Doug Kenney, containing a compilation of all of his contributions. Chris Miller, co-writer of Animal House, paid homage by naming the main character in his 1996 film Multiplicity Doug Kinney, a variation on, and tribute to, Kenney. Twenty-six years after Kenney's death, the book A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever was published, a biography on Kenney and the impact he made on comedy and the people he knew. The book was adapted into the 2018 Netflix feature film A Futile and Stupid Gesture, which stars comedian Will Forte as Kenney and is narrated by actor Martin Mull as a fictional future Kenney.

According to Ibn Ishaq, it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, sometime before the Isra and Mi'raj. Text and meaning Text and transliteration *Hafs from Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud 1 2 3  Warsh from Nafi Ω al-Madani 1 2 3 Meanings Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) Al-Kauthar (a river in Paradise); Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only).

Commentary The word kawthar is derived from the root ŸÉ - ÿ´ - ÿ± k - th - r, which has meanings of \\"to increase in number, to outnumber, to happen frequently; to show pride in wealth and/or children; to be rich, plentiful, abundance.\\" The form kawthar itself is an intensive deverbal noun, meaning \\"abundance, multitude.\\" It appears in the Qur'an solely in this s≈´rah. Hadith The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

This surah was held in special esteem in hadith, which can be observed by these related narratives. * Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that a man said, \\"O Messenger of Allah! What is Al-Kawthar He replied: (It is a river in Paradise which my Lord has given me. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. There are birds in it whose necks are (long) like carrots.) \`Umar said, \\"O Messenger of Allah! Verily, they (the birds) will be beautiful. The Prophet replied,(The one who eats them (i.e., the people of Paradise) will be more beautiful than them, O \`Umar.) * Narrated Anas bin Malik : The Prophet said: While I was walking in Paradise (on the night of Mi'raj), I saw a river, on the two banks of which there were tents made of hollow pearls. I asked, \\"What is this, O Gabriel?' He said, 'That is the Kauthar which Your Lord has given to you.' Behold!

Therefore, turn to thy Lord for prayer and offer sacrifice, and surely thy enemy is cut off (from the good). Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know what Kauthar is? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: It (Kauthar) is a canal which my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious has promised me, and there is an abundance of good in it. It is a cistern and my people would come to it on the Day of Resurrection, and tumblers there would be equal to the number of stars. A servant would be turned away from (among the people gathered there). Upon this I would say: My Lord, he is one of my people, and He (the Lord) would say: You do not know that he innovated new things (in Islam) after you.

He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, even though our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)\\" When Allah's Apostle was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Allah's Apostle came to them and said, \\"What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?\\" The learned ones among them replied,\\" O Allah's Apostle! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, 'May Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quraish and leaves the Ansar, even though our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.' \\" Allah's Apostle replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won't you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah's Apostle to your houses? By Allah, what you will return with, is better than what they are returning with.\\" The Ansar replied, \\"Yes, O Allah's Apostle, we are satisfied' Then the Prophet said to them.\\" You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise).\\" (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient.Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 53: One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus) Volume 4, Number 375 References External links *Quran 108 Sahih International translation Kawthar Category:Fatimah ","title":"Al-Kawthar"},{"id":"1122743","text":"Arun Kaul (12 August 1933 ‚Äì 21 July 2007) was a noted Kashmiri film maker and screenwriter.
