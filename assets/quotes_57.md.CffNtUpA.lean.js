Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on November 27, 1815, as an Infantry Division of the W√ºrzburg General Command (Infanterie-Division des Generalkommandos W√ºrzburg).G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 663; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deutschen Heeres (1905), p. 1252. It was called the 3rd Army Division between 1822 and 1848, again between 1851 and 1859, and again from 1869 to 1872.Wegner, p. 663; Bredow, p. 1252. It was called the 3rd Infantry Division from 1848 to 1851 (as well as during wartime) and was named the Nuremberg General Command from 1859 to 1869.Wegner, p. 661; Bredow, p. 1242. From April 1, 1872, until mobilization for World War I, it was the 3rd Division.Wegner, p. 663; Bredow, pp. 1246, 1252. In 1901, it had swapped division numbers with the 5th Division. In Bavarian sources, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, as this was considered self-evident, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was headquartered in Nuremberg from 1815 to 1843, in Ansbach from 1843 to 1848, and then again in Nuremberg until 1901, when after the renumbering of divisions, it became the 3rd Division in Landau and the division in Nuremberg became the 5th Division. The division was part of the II Royal Bavarian Army Corps. Combat chronicle The division fought against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, seeing action at Zella, Kissingen, and Helmstadt. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the division fought alongside the Prussians. It saw action in battles of W√∂rth and Sedan, and in the siege of Paris.Bredow, p. 1252. During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers against French forces in the early stages, and then participated in the Race to the Sea, fighting along the Somme and in Flanders, including the First Battle of Ypres. It remained in the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois, and fought in the Second Battle of Artois and the Battle of Loos. In 1916, the division fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, the division fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Messines, after which it went to the trenchlines in Verdun and Lorraine to rest. After several months in the line north of the Ailette River, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). In the subsequent Allied counteroffensives known as the Hundred Days Offensive, the division fought in the Battle of Amiens and the Second Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Third Battle of the Somme. Thereafter, it remained in the line and resisted various Allied attacks until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as one of the best German divisions.3\\\\.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 3rd Bavarian Division was renamed the 3rd Bavarian Infantry Division.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). The 3rd Bavarian Infantry Division was triangularized in April 1915, sending the 22nd Bavarian Infantry Regiment to the newly formed 11th Bavarian Infantry Division. An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, and the engineer contingent was increased. Divisional signals commanders were established to better control communications, a major problem in coordinating infantry and artillery operations during World War I. The division's order of battle on March 31, 1918, was as follows:Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle *6. bayerische Infanterie-Brigade **Kgl. Bayerisches 17. Infanterie-Regiment Orff **Kgl. Bayerisches 18.

He grew up skateboarding, attending punk rock shows, drawing, and with a dry yet sharp sense of humor. He has no formal training in art, learning some technique by painting skateboards and houses. He was a prominent 'zine artist, and his publication \\"Karmaboarder,\\" a skateboarding and art zine he published in the early to late 1980s, helped shape what later became initial well-known works. He moved to San Francisco, California's Mission District in 1989, where he became a member of the local art community, initially drawing cartoons on lampposts and bathroom walls using black Sharpies. From 1989 until 1992, Johanson attended City College of San Francisco. In 1994, Johanson did one of the initial board graphic runs for a new San Francisco-based skateboard brand, Anti-Hero, which brought his art to a wider audience. Also, during this time, he played in a band called \\"Tina, Age 13,\\" which was scrawled on a drawing the band came across randomly.

It is situated in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka. It was established on 11 December 1938 as Bengal Agricultural Institute (BAI) and later upgraded to university in 2001 renaming it as Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. Since its establishment, the university plays a role in agricultural research and development (R&D;) of the region through the creation of knowledge, agricultural technology generation and transfer, crop diversification and intensification for the benefit of farming communities. SAU offers undergraduate, post graduate, and Ph.D. degrees through course credit system. History Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka, Bangladesh SAU was established as Bengal Agricultural Institute (BAI) on 11 December 1938 by Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq, the chief minister of undivided Bengal. The Bengal Agricultural Institute was renamed East Pakistan Agricultural Institute in 1947. After the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971, the name of the institute was spontaneously changed to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute (BAI). Since its inception in 1938, the BAI had been functioning as a Faculty of Agriculture under Dhaka University. After the establishment of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) at Mymensingh in 1961 its academic function was transferred to BAU in 1964 until its upgrade to Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University in 2001. Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka, Bangladesh SAU became the 17th public university of the country in 2001. The Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Act 2001 was passed in the Parliament of Bangladesh on 9 July. The foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 15 July 2001 and inaugurated the university activities through the appointment of the first vice-chancellor: Professor Md. Shadat Ulla. SAU functioned as a university from 2001 with a single faculty: the Faculty of Agriculture following the issuance of a notification by the government as per requirement of the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Act 2001. On 22 June 2009, a bill was placed in the parliament to assign the president as chancellor. The Agribusiness Management , Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine and Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Science faculties started in 2007, 2012 and 2017. Nearly 5,700 graduates plus 600 postgraduates have been produced by the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University.

It is part of Chesapeake City Public Schools and is located on 2900 Margaret Booker Drive. History In 1845, Norfolk County, Virginia constructed the first public school in Deep Creek, Virginia. It was the second school to be constructed in Norfolk County from funds provided by the General Assembly for public education. The one-room school was across from the present day Deep Creek Intermediate School. The school was closed and destroyed by federal troops during the Civil War. In 1870, a school was erected on Old Gilmerton Road. Several years later, a one-room school facing Galberry Road behind and adjacent to Flemming's Store was constructed. In 1897, a wing was added to separately house the older students. In 1908, the legislature provided funds for the construction of a one-story brick school on the site of the previous intermediate school. Schools from the outlying areas were consolidated and students from St. Juliens Creek, Millsville, Grassfield, and Gilmerton were transported by horse-drawn school buses to Deep Creek School. In 1910, a two- story brick building was constructed on the site of the intermediate school. The first class of seniors was graduated from Deep Creek High School in 1911. Building additions were made in 1923, 1947, and 1952. In 1955, Deep Creek High School was separated from Deep Creek School by the construction of a million dollar secondary building to house grades 7-12 on Deal Drive. In the 1940s, with the assistance of the Rosenwald Fund, a four-room elementary school was built for black students in the Deep Creek borough. Black students from Deep Creek attended Providence High School in South Norfolk, which later became incorporated into Carver High School and Gilmerton High School. Both schools later became incorporated into Crestwood High School when it opened in 1954. The black elementary schools in Grassfield, Deep Creek, and Millsville were consolidated in the 1950s and were housed in Central Elementary School on Shipyard Road. In 1963, Deep Creek High School became part of the newly formed Chesapeake School System, which resulted from a merger of Norfolk County and the City of South Norfolk. In 1966, grades 7-8 were shifted from the high school to the junior high, which is today's SECEP school. In 1979, due to large increases in enrollment at the high school and junior high school, the high school building on Deal Drive was redesignated a junior high school and a $7 million high school on Margaret Booker Drive was constructed to house grades 10-12. The modern, efficient facility has been in use for more than thirty years. Academic classrooms, vocational training areas, corridors, gymnasium, media center, computer laboratory, and the commons area are well designed for the purposes they serve. The school was expanded in 1990 with a new wing serving the Math, Science and Foreign Language departments. The space was needed due to the addition of the ninth grade. In the summer of 1998, the school was expanded again to accommodate an enrollment of approximately 2,000 students. This new expansion includes improvements to the library, gymnasium, and classrooms for Science, Special Education, Art, and Vocational programs. In 2011, Deep Creek High School was designated as a Science and Medicine Academy. Students from all over Chesapeake desiring to pursue a career in the medicine can apply. The four-year program is designed to allow students to begin gaining the knowledge needed to be successful in medical school. Students earn college credits and real-world experience in an array of science and medical subjects. Athletics and extracurricular activities The mascot is a hornet and the sports teams currently play in the AAA Southeastern District of the AAA Eastern Region. State championships and appearances *In the early-1980s, the school's girls' basketball team appeared in three consecutive state championship games, winning in 1982 (defeating Gar-Field High School, but losing the two following years, both times to W.T. Woodson High School. *The football team dominated on both the local and state level throughout the entire 1990s, posting several undefeated regular seasons (1994, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000), and forming a rivalry with Indian River High School and Western Branch High School. Deep Creek reached the state championship game in 1994 and 2000, losing to Patrick Henry High School of Ashland, VA and Centreville High School, respectively. Deep Creek has been particularly known for their track and field program which has won state championships in 1995, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007. Because of the building of Grassfield High School, many of the track stars have been rezoned and will now compete against Deep Creek High for state championships. In 2004, the Men's Volleyball Team completed an undefeated regular season in the Southeastern District and advanced to the State Tournament for the first time in school history. In 2015, the Ladies Varsity Softball Team won their second consecutive Conference 17 Championship as well as their first 4A South Regional Championship. They played in their first ever Virginia State Tournament. Unfortunately they fell in the semi-final round, finishing their best ever season with a 25-4 record.

Building The land was originally the property of Isaac Bobbin, an early settler, until being subdivided into the present parcel and sold to Mathias Carvey in 1805, around the time the stone house was built. The house was built in the first decade of the 19th century in the then-dominant Federal style, with two storeys, three bays and a sidehall plan. However, it also features some unique touches such as a gambrel roof, with a corresponding dormer added later. It also appears taller than it actually is due to the sloping land beneath. An original front porch that ran the width of the house was removed during the 20th century. Two of its features, a low-pitched roof on a two-story dwelling and a wide top section, suggest some connection to New England building traditions. Decorative sidelights, transom light around the entryway and brick surrounds on the front windows show the slow move from the vernacular styles of the colonial era to the Federal style of American independence, which put more emphasis on a decorative facade. The house's interior has not been significantly altered since its construction. The original wall finishings are gone, but much of the woodwork and molding remains. Two other buildings are located on the property: a barn, also gambrel-roofed, and a garage. The former dates to the original construction of the house and is considered a contributing resource; the latter is more contemporary and does not contribute to the historic value of the house. History Carvey had bought the property from William Robinson, two owners removed from Bobbin, to support his mill on a nearby stream. He in turn sold it to Benjamin Gatfield, in whose family it would remain for almost a century. It has been through a number of private owners since then. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 8, 1996.

History Former Principal Eric Nadelstern founded the International High School at LaGuardia Community College in 1985 as a joint venture by the New York City Board of Education and the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York. The school has been designated as an Academic Excellence Project and has twice been cited as a Center of Excellence for the teaching of English communication arts. Nadelstern left the school to join the NY Department of Education. After holding a variety of roles, Nadelstern is the department's chief schools officer and reports directly to the Chancellor. The school's success has been the model of 11 additional International high schools in New York and California. All twelve high schools belong to the Internationals Network for Public Schools, an educational non-profit that supports these schools and an expansion of the model to serve English language learners throughout the United States. Curriculum IHS curriculum requirements meet or exceed all New York State Education Department standards for a high school diploma. All classes are heterogeneous (mixed) by language, achievement, grade level, and age. Classes are structured around the development of thematic projects in cooperative learning groups. Students work in depth, both collaboratively and independently. Students fulfill graduation requirements by passing year-long interdisciplinary programs incorporating the Humanities, Math/Science/Technology, and Applied Learning. There are six interdisciplinary programs based on such themes as: *American Dream: Bridges to Reality *Connections *Inquiry and Action *Origins, Growth, and Structures *Projects and Adventures in New York City *The World Around Us/World of Money Applied Learning Opportunities Interdisciplinary programs give students a variety of opportunities to apply what they learn in the classroom to real life situations, such as working with architects to build bridges or environmentalists to clean up polluted bodies of ware. Two special programs include internship and community service. Internship: Some teams offer career education internships where students explore careers they are interested in while attending high school. During an internship, students take two classes and for the rest work for various organizations and companies. Internship sites include government agencies, big and small businesses, and hospitals. Community Service: Another team offers students an opportunity to develop a community service project in class and put it into practice. In the past students have researched and presented material on teen issues and developed a website. Graduation Certification Students graduate when they have successfully completed a minimum of four years of interdisciplinary study and have been certified by a panel including faculty, students, and representatives from the educational community. Each student is sponsored by a faculty mentor who assists the student in assembling a portfolio of performance-based assessment tasks drawn from their course work and prepares a presentation. The student may include college course work, and other evidence of growth and mastery as part of their petition for graduation. This panel will determine if the student's progress meets or exceeds the student performance standards for graduation in New York State, and merits graduation from The International High School. Certification for graduation is based on a consensus of the panel and is also subject to successful completion of course work. Graduation panels are scheduled during January, June, and August. Graduation Portfolio Over 90% of IHS students graduate and go on to two or four year colleges. In addition to CUNY, many of our graduates continue to study and complete their college degrees with partial or full financial aid, including scholarships at many of the top universities in the country.

Abatete is bordered by Uke, Ogidi, Abacha, Oraukwu, Alor, Ideani, Eziowelle, Umuoji. It is located in Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State. It is made up of four villages namely : Nsukwu, Agbaja, Ogbu and Odida. Its people are one of the Igbo speaking peoples of Eastern Nigeria. Abatete, like most Igbo communities, has a rich cultural heritage. Okolie Otie was indisputably the ancestral father of Abatete, Umuoji and Nkpor, but his origin is still unsettled. Otie had three sons: Edeogu, Ora and Ideke. Edeogu his eldest son married Mgboko eke, and they had nine sons: Viz, Nsukwu, Agbaja, Isiuzo, Akwa, Azu ogwa, Mputu, Odida, and Ogbu in that order. Ora married and had a son he named Oji. When Oji had his own son he gave him his grandfather's name. Oji's descendants are known as Umuoji. The first village in Umuoji is Eziora as a reflection of their grandfather's name. Ideke's descendants are known as Nkpor. Edeogu the father of Nkpor. Edeogu the father of Abatete proudly referred to his nine sons as Igwulube-otie-denoting the plurality of his children. Over generation, Mbateghete was corrupted to Abateghete and to Abatete with the advent of British rule. Out of nine sons of Edeogu only four survived to form the four pillars of Abatete namely: Nsukwu, Agbaja, Odida and Ogbu. Isiuzo clan had group into a quarter but was driven out of Abatete due to constant feud. In 1904, the British administration through the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria based in Onitsha sent a Gun Breaking expedition (Otiji Egbe) to Abatete as a prelude to imposing imperial rule. Armed surrogates posing as peacemakers were deployed in all the four quarters of Abatete. At first, they pleaded with the natives for assistance to subdue a troublesome neighboring community. They requested that every gun owner assemble at the market square with their guns. Most natives took the bait. What happened next shook the foundation of the town. Suddenly, the soldiers unleashed their superior firepower and burnt down market stalls and shrines. Capitulation was complete. Native guns were confiscated, stacked and set ablaze. As the fire smoldered so did the pride and power of Abatete. In 1905, District Officer in charge of Onitsha asked the four quarters of Abatete to select their warrant chiefs. Agbaja selected Eze Omaliko-Atulee Ekusa of Ezimuku, but Ogbuefi Omenyi Anaekwe begged to differ. He reminded, ‚ÄúKing makers‚Äù that Omaliko deity would be deeply troubled by the trappings of office of the Warrant Chief. His argument prevailed and Ogbuefi Anaekwe was selected to become a Warrant Chief. Chief Onwadiebo Nebuwa Ezekwe, the charismatic grandson of Ebube Ogu, the progenitor of Nri lineage in Nsukwu was a favorite son and well credentialed to serve as Warrant Chief. of NsukwuChief Eze-Elisiaku Anyaegbu was selected and appointed Odida Warrant Chief. Otiji Egbe expedition was traumatic to Ogbu people and that bred mistrust of white men. Rightful titled chiefs declined nomination for Warrant Chief, and Chief Uduezue Omaliko volunteered and thus became a Warrant Chief by default. The first church/school was built in 1908 by a Catholic Priest Rev. Father Ward at Agbaja. Chief Anaekwe sought and secured the approval of the project from other Warrant Chiefs. In return, quota system of equal representation on admission was instituted. It allowed 50 boys from each quarter of Abatete to enroll for classes. Penalty for tardiness/absence was one fowl for each transgression. But other Warrant Chiefs from Nsukwu, Odida, and Ogbu watched with disbelief as the loot from extortion of yam, fowl or goat for missing Akwukwo. Anaekwe went exclusively to Chief Anaekwe, despite the fact that most of the fines were coming from their district because of distance to the school. The Warrant Chiefs of Nsukwu, Odida and Ogbu met and decided to get even by inviting the Church Missionary Society (C.M.S) to build church/school in their own backyard. There was a catch. They had to pay teachers salary of 6.00 pounds. Chief Onwadiebo Ezekwe could afford it. He paid up and Christ Church was built at Olile-Nsukwu in 1914. Odida and Ogbu Warrant Chiefs pulled their resources together and St John's Church was built at Ogbu-ikwele. In 1930, both churches merged and moved to present location at Afor-Agu as Holy Trinity church. The churches did not come with schools attached. The young converts would have to attend school at a very far location at Eziowelle. It was afternoon school and at an appointed time the town crier would beckon the pupils to school with Ekwe: *Gbaghalu ji, *Gbaghalu ede *Jebe akwukwo, *Kpom kpom kpom. In 1937, Holy Trinity School was built incorporated and popularly known as Uno Akwukwo Afo-Agu. In 1929 St Dominic's Church/School Agbaja branched out to Ekeagu. Its staff residence was built by Otu-Nkwali, Ogbu. New Africa school and later renamed Chukwura Primary School was built by great philanthropist Sir P. E. Chukwura and was commissioned in 1945. Holy Rosary Convent School was built in 1948 to enhance and promote female education at Abatete. Notre Dame High School, which started life as Lugard Memorial High School was built by Chief T. O. Morah and Chief S. Mbakwe of Abacha in 1958. Girls Secondary School was built by the Abatete Social Club of Nigeria and was commissioned in 1979. The Warrant Chiefs in their wisdom brought to Abatete Churches and Schools for salvation, education, and knowledge. But they never imagined the problem religious intolerance and zealotry would create. Thus, Abatete waded from one religious crisis juxtaposed with politics and greed to another for three decades. Every issue had religious undertone, it was either Anglican or Catholic, nothing in between. Never mind that at the time, majority were traditionalists, God was either an Anglican or a Catholic. Whether it was commissioning of maternity clinic or Igwe selection, myopic views prevailed. Abatete crisis reached a crescendo in 1959 when Eastern Region Government asked towns to nominate community heads. Chief Peter Aroh Eze-Onyeka was unanimously selected for installation as Igwe of Abatete, but the Igwe designate had a problem: he was an Anglican extraction. Many Catholic faithful gave their blessings to Chief Onunkwo Ezenwayo for Igweship as a counter weight for an Anglican backed Igwe. Abatete was in quagmire with two Igwes, each with enthusiastic supporters. The animosity between the two camps produced sound-bites ‚ÄòUtala n‚Äôofe‚Äô ostensibly referring to Peter Aroh Eze-Onyeka's camp while ‚ÄòAkpu aghaka‚Äô referred to Ezenwayo's chairleaders. Such was the situation until 1963 when the impasse was resolved at Ekeagu. In 1976 the Anambra State government made a policy requiring every town to nominate a Chief for recognition. Nsukwu, Odida, and Ogbu nominated Chief P. U. Mkpume. Other candidates Chief J. C. J. Anaekwe and Chief Anisiobi also filed their nomination papers at Ogidi. Justice Agbakoba's Commission of Enquiry was set up to resolve the issue. In the end Chief Mkpume was the winner and Anambra State government recognized Mkpume as the Igwe of Abatete. On Nkwo, Saturday June 9, 1990, Chief Patrick Ugochukwu Mkpume was conferred as the Igwe Edeogu 1 of Abatete. Abatete has four Obis representing each quarter (in red below) and Ichies representing each of the 25 wards. Abatete sits on a high altitude plane, hundreds of feet above sea level. The seasons swing between long periods of dry and wet seasons with a little touch dry harmattan. Natives are agrarian but early settlers were artisans. Because labor was needed for production on the farm, polygamy was a necessity. The more hands on the till, the better the production. In the middle of the 20th century, the natives started branching out to less labor-intensive and better paying jobs Driving and carpentry were at the head of the class. Then, they developed the technology of customizing vehicles. On merchandise retailing Abatete is a top dog. Today, Abatete excels in all fields, both public and private sector.

A rocker arm and two types of links open the intake-valves by transferring the rotational movement of a drive shaft with an eccentric cam to the output cam. The movement of the output cam is varied by rotating the control shaft with a DC stepper motor and changing the fulcrums of the links. This makes the continuous adjustment of the amount of the valve's lift (e.g., the amount of intake opening), during the intake valve event in the four-stroke cycle, possible. CVTC and VVEL together control the valve phases and its valve events, allowing free-control of the valve timing and lift. This results in more efficient airflow to the cylinder, significantly improved responsiveness, optimizing the balance between power and environmental performance. It performs similarly to BMW's Valvetronic system but with desmodromic control of the output cam, allowing VVEL to operate at higher engine speeds (RPM). Other similar systems are offered Toyota (Valvematic).

The western terminus is the West Virginia state line in Independence Township where the road becomes West Virginia Route 27 (WV 27). The eastern terminus is at PA 18 in Washington. PA 844 is a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas in western Washington County, serving West Middletown. Along the way, the route intersects PA 50 and PA 231 in Independence Township and PA 331 in Canton Township. The road between West Middletown and Washington became a private turnpike called the Washington and West Middletown Turnpike in 1852. The entire stretch of PA 844 was designated as the westernmost part of PA 31 in 1928. It was renumbered to PA 844 in September 1964 when the western terminus of PA 31 was cut back to West Newton. Route description PA 844 begins at the West Virginia border in Independence Township, where the road continues west into that state as WV 27. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Washington Pike, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. A short distance later, PA 844 comes to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 50 in the community of Independence. From this point, the road continues through more rural areas, forming a short concurrency with PA 231. The route continues east into more forested areas with some residences, heading into Hopewell Township and becoming Jefferson Avenue. PA 844 enters West Middletown, where it passes homes along Main Street. Upon crossing back into Hopewell Township, the route becomes Jefferson Avenue again and runs through a mix of farms and woods before heading southeast into open agricultural areas. The road passes through the community of Buffalo and continues through more farmland with patches of trees and residences. A short distance after entering Canton Township, PA 844 comes to a junction with the eastern terminus of PA 331 and passes more farms. Farther southeast, residential development near the road increases as it comes to the community of Wolfdale. The route passes homes and a few businesses before heading into industrial areas and crossing the Chartiers Creek. PA 844 enters Washington and passes homes and businesses before ending at PA 18. History In 1819, commissioners were appointed to lay out a turnpike between Washington and Wellsburg, West Virginia (then a part of Virginia) along the present-day alignment of PA 844. What is now PA 844 between West Middletown and Washington was established as the Washington and West Middletown Turnpike on April 27, 1852. The turnpike ran between the National Road in Washington and New Middletown and contained one tollgate. On April 14, 1863, an act was passed to macadamize a portion of the Washington and West Middletown Turnpike. When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, the present-day alignment of PA 844 was designated as Legislative Route 242. In 1928, the road between the West Virginia border near Independence and PA 18 in Washington was designated as the westernmost portion of PA 31, which continued east from Washington to US 30 near Bedford. At this time, the entire length of PA 31 between the West Virginia border and Washington was paved except for the section between PA 28 (now PA 50) and PA 231. This unpaved section was paved by 1930. In September 1964, the western terminus of PA 31 was cut back to West Newton in order to avoid intersecting I-70 at multiple locations; the state only wanted state routes to intersect an Interstate highway once to avoid motorist confusion. PA 844 replaced the PA 31 designation between the West Virginia border and PA 18 in Washington.

Originally begun in 1992 as a bilateral exercise between India and the United States, Japan became a permanent partner in 2015. Past non-permanent participants was Singapore. The annual Malabar series began in 1992 and includes diverse activities, ranging from fighter combat operations from aircraft carriers through Maritime Interdiction Operations Exercises. With the decision to include Australia in the drills by India in 2020, it will be the first time all members of the regional grouping known as the Quad will be engaging militarily. History The first naval exercise, named Malabar-I, between India and the United States was held in May 1992. Three exercises were conducted before 1998, when the Americans suspended exercises after India tested nuclear weapons. However, the United States renewed military contacts following the September 11 attacks when India joined President George W Bush's campaign against international terrorism. 2002 In 2002, the exercises comprised basic passing maneuvers among naval vessels, anti-submarine exercises and replenishment-at-sea drills. 2003 In 2003, US warships and ; US submarine ; Indian guided missile frigates and ; Indian submarine INS Shalki and aircraft conducted anti-submarine warfare tactics. 2004 In 2004, Malabar participants included advanced assets like the USS Paul F. Foster (DD-964), , a Los Angeles-class submarine, US Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, and the SH-60B Seahawk LAMPS MKIII helicopter. This enabled both navies to engage in submarine familiarization exercises, a key capability for anti-submarine warfare collaboration. 2005 In 2005, Malabar featured the participation of the aircraft carriers and INS Viraat. During a month of operations, US and Indian forces collaborated on a wide variety of tasks ranging from a joint diving salvage operation to a 24-hour 'war at sea' simulation that saw the two forces engage in mock combat. 2006 In 2006, the Expeditionary Strike Group (BOXESG) comprising 13 ships including amphibious ships, cruisers, destroyers, and the US submarine as well as Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) participated in the exercise. It was the first time a United States Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) led the exercise. The addition of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Midgett (WHEC 726) and an Indian Coast Guard Patrol Ship allowed for the exchange of Coast Guard practices between nations in maritime law enforcement, anti-piracy operations, pollution control, search and rescue, and VBSS support. During the second phase, BOXESG pulled into several Indian ports, including Mumbai and Goa. The stop offered BOXESG a chance to experience Indian culture, re-supply, and support a Habitat for Humanity project. The visit gave leadership a chance to discuss future Malabar exercises and interoperability between the three nation's armed forces. 2007 A pair of Indian Air Force Jaguars flying in formation beside a pair of Indian Navy Sea Harriers and a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, flying over the Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Viraat during Exercise Malabar 2007. Malabar 2007 was the ninth Malabar exercise and was the first one to be held outside the Indian Ocean, off the Japanese island of Okinawa. Besides interception and dissimilar air combat exercises, it featured surface and anti-submarine warfare, maritime interdiction and visit, board, search, and seizure operations to counter piracy and other non-state acts at sea. On 4 September 2007, the naval exercise included 25 vessels from India, the United States, Japan, Australia and Singapore in the Bay of Bengal. This was the first time a joint exercise of this scale involving 25 vessels was conducted. The exercise was previously a bilateral India-US engagement that was expanded for the first time. India's Left parties that have criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government on the India-US civilian nuclear deal had vehemently protested the exercise, seeing it as another sign of the growing closeness between the two countries. At one time, the Indian government was known to have considered postponing or canceling the exercise but the Indian Navy put its foot down, saying the logistics involved made any delay impossible. China, which did off not officially comment on the exercise, was known to be unhappy over the event as it was being conducted in the Bay of Bengal for the first time. China has been cultivating naval cooperation with Bangladesh and Myanmar to gain access to the Bay of Bengal and has been strengthening military cooperation with Sri Lanka. In June, China had issued a 'demarche' to India, United States, Japan and Australia seeking details about their four-nation meeting, termed a Quadrilateral Initiative. India and Australia had quickly assured Beijing that security and defence issues did not form part of the meeting's agenda. The US Navy had the largest representation during Malabar 2007 with 13 warships, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz that was protested when it dropped anchor off Chennai in July. The other vessels included the conventionally powered carrier USS Kitty Hawk, the nuclear submarine , two guided missile cruisers, and six guided missile destroyers. Eight warships, including the aircraft carrier INS Viraat, represented the Indian Navy. The other warships were the destroyers INS Mysore, INS Rana and INS Ranjit, fleet tanker INS Jyoti (A58) and a corvette INS Kuthar. Viraat's Sea Harrier jets and Sea King helicopters, and the Indian Air Force's Jaguar deep-penetration strike aircraft were also seen in action. Australia was represented by a frigate and a tanker; Japan by two destroyers; and Singapore by a frigate. 2008 From 19 October 2008, Exercise Malabar 08, the twelfth of the series, was conducted in the Arabian Sea. The purpose of Malabar 2008 was to promote increased inter-operability between the United States and India, with a special emphasis on maritime interdiction, including counter-piracy and counter-terrorism operation. Rear Admiral Anil Chopra, Flag Officer Commanding, Western Fleet (FOCWF), noted: :\\"This greatly enhances our two navies‚Äô interoperability, which is very important to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, as well as issues of maritime security and piracy.\\" The US Navy was represented by the 's Carrier Strike Group Seven. In addition, one submarine, , and one P3C Orion aircraft also participated in the exercise. Joining Carrier Group Seven were the fast combat support ship and the nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine and a P-3C maritime patrol aircraft. Indian naval units included guided-missile destroyers and ; the guided-missile frigates , , , and ; the replenishment tanker ; and a Shishumar-class diesel-electric submarine. 2009 The Indian Navy, Japan Maritime Self Defense Force and U.S. Navy expanded their maritime partnerships during exercise Malabar 2009, held off the coast of Japan between 29 April and 3 May 2009. The features of Exercise Malabar 2009 were: ‚Ä¢ Visit, Board, Search & Seizure (VBBS) techniques ‚Ä¢ Surface warfare maneuvers ‚Ä¢ Anti-submarine warfare ‚Ä¢ Gunnery training ‚Ä¢ Air defense The ships involved from India were INS Mumbai (D62), INS Khanjar (P47), INS Ranvir (D54) and INS Jyoti (A58). The ships from Japan were JDS Kurama (DDH144) and JDS Asayuki (DD132). The ships from the US were USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19), USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62), USS Chafee (DDG 90) and the USS Seawolf (SSN 21). 2010 Ships, submarines and aircraft from the United States Navy's Seventh Fleet arrived in Goa, India, 23 April to begin Exercise Malabar 2010 hosted by the Indian Navy. \\"The U.S. Navy and Indian Navy are natural partners and friends who share a mutual desire to ensure security and stability in this region,\\" said Rear Adm. Kevin M. Donegan, Commander, Battle Force Seventh Fleet. \\"A high-end exercise like Malabar strengthens our growing naval relationship and the interoperability between our two professional maritime forces.\\" Training conducted at-sea included surface and antisubmarine warfare, coordinated gunnery exercises, air defense, and visit, board, search, and seizure drills. Sailors took part in professional exchanges and discussions while at-sea and on shore. United States Navy personnel participated in a community service project during the port visit to Goa. United States forces participating in Malabar included the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh (CG 67), Arleigh Burke- class guided-missile destroyers USS Lassen (DDG 82) and USS Chafee (DDG 90), Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided-missile frigate USS Curts (FFG 38), Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Annapolis (SSN 760), P-3 Orion aircraft, SH-60 helicopters and a Sea, Air and Land (SEAL) special forces detachment. 2011 U.S. Carrier Strike Group Ronald Reagan with the Indian Navy The Malabar Series of Exercises 2‚Äì10 April 2011 were held off the Okinawa coast. India had stopped involving more countries in the exercises after China, in 2007, sent demarches to all the participants of a five-nation naval exercise held in the Bay of Bengal. With the Japanese participation in 2009 raising no political storm, India was once again agreeable to the idea of allowing the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force to participate. Carrier Strike Group Seven participated in Malabar 2011. United States naval units initially included the guided-missile destroyers and ; the guided-missile frigate ; and nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Santa Fe (SSN-763). Indian naval units included the guided-missile destroyers , , and ; the corvette ; and the replenishment tanker Jyoti. The at-sea portions were conducted in the western Pacific Ocean, east of the Luzon Strait, and east of Okinawa. The exercise's location coincided with the Indian Navy's western Pacific deployment. Malabar 2011 was designed to advance United States-Indian coordination and operational capacity. Exercise events included liaison officer professional exchanges and embarks; communications exercises; surface action group exercise operations; formation maneuvering; helicopter cross deck evolutions; underway replenishments; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; gunnery exercises; visit, board, search and seizure; maritime strike; air defense; screen exercise and anti-submarine warfare.

The frigate INS Satpura, destroyers INS Ranvir and INS Ranvijay, and corvette INS Kulish represented the Indian Navy, along with Indian Navy replenishment oiler . The exercise took place in approximately 450 nautical miles of sea and air space, and offered the opportunity for the United States and Indian naval services to conduct communications exercises, surface action group (SAG) operations, helicopter cross-deck evolutions, and gunnery exercises. The participants split into two SAGs, with Bunker Hill leading one and Satpura leading the other. Carl Vinson and CVW-17 provided air support for the exercise. 2013 Indian Navy-US Navy bilateral exercise, MALABAR 2013 commenced on 5 November 2013 and continued until 11 November 2013 in the Bay of Bengal. Events planned during the 'At-Sea' phase included professional exchanges and embarkations; communications exercises; Surface Action Group operations; leapfrogs; helicopter cross-deck evolutions; gunnery exercises; Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Participation from the US Navy includes the Arleigh Burke-class guided- missile destroyer USS McCampbell (DDG 85) and a P-3 Orion aircraft. Indian Navy participation includes the indigenously built frigate INS Shivalik (F47), the guided missile destroyer INS Ranvijay (D55) and Tupolev Tu-142 Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft. 2014 Ships of the Indian, Japanese and the U.S. Navies sail together during Exercise Malabar 2014. Exercise Malabar 2014 commenced on 24 July 2014 at Sasebo Naval Base, Japan. This edition of MALABAR was a trilateral one involving the navies of India, Japan and the United States. The exercise involved Carrier strike group operations, Maritime patrol and Reconnaissance operations, anti piracy operations and Visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations, Search and rescue exercises, helicopter cross-deck landings, Underway replenishment, gunnery and anti-submarine warfare exercises, and Liaison officer exchange and embarkation. The Indian Navy was represented by INS Ranvijay (guided missile destroyer), INS Shivalik (stealth frigate) and (fleet tanker). Two destroyers along with a P3C Orion and a ShinMaywa US-2 were participating from the Japanese Navy. From the U.S. Navy one submarine (SSN), two destroyers, one tanker along with one Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft participated. One United States Navy Carrier Strike group (CSG) based on the Nimitz class carrier USS George Washington joined for the sea phase of the exercise. 2015 On 26 January 2015, the U.S. President and Indian Prime Minister agreed, in a joint statement, to upgrade exercise Malabar. India invited Japan to be a part of exercise, held in the Bay of Bengal. Since 2007, India has only hosted Exercise Malabar when the US and India are the two participating parties. Malabar 2009, 2011, and 2014 all took place off the coast of Japan and included the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Forces. The exercise was undertaken by the three countries in the Bay of Bengal from 15 October 2015 till 19 October 2015.Malabar-15 naval exercise begins Deccan Herald 15 October 2015 The Indian Navy was represented by INS Sindhuraj (diesel-electric submarine), INS Ranvijay (guided missile destroyer), INS Shivalik (stealth frigate), INS Betwa (guided-missile frigate) and (fleet tanker).

There was also joint training between the naval special forces of the Indian and US Navies at INS Karna, Visakhapatnam. A total of 16 ships, 2 submarines and 95 aircraft participated in this exercise. It was the first exercise between the three countries which involved three aircraft carriers. The Indian Navy was represented by the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and its air wing, a guided missile destroyer INS Ranvir, two indigenous stealth frigates INS Shivalik and INS Sahyadri, an ASW corvette INS Kamorta, two missile corvettes INS Kora and INS Kirpan, one Sindhughosh-class submarine, fleet tanker INS Jyoti and a Poseidon P8I aircraft. The American Navy was represented by the aircraft carrier and its air wing, a guided missile cruiser , three guided missile destroyers: , and , a Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine and a Poseidon P-8A aircraft. The Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was represented by a helicopter carrier JS Izumo (DDH 183) and its air wing and a missile destroyer JS Sazanami (DD1 13). 2018 The 2018 Malabar exercise was conducted from 7 to 16 June 2018 off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea. This was the 22nd edition of the exercise and the first time it was held on United States territory. The exercise is divided into two phases. The harbor phase was held from 7 to 10 June at Naval Base Guam, and the sea phase from 11 to 16 June. The exercise focused on onshore and at-sea training, aircraft carrier operations, maritime patrol and reconnaissance operations, visit, board, search and seizure operations and professional exchanges. Based on news reports, India refused Australia participation in the exercise to avoid posturing it as a military group against China. The Indian Navy was represented by stealth frigate INS Sahyadri; AsW corvette INS Kamorta and fleet tanker INS Shakti and a Boeing P-8I Neptune aircraft. The U.S. Navy was represented by aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan with its air wing; two guided missile cruisers, USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville; two guided missile destroyers, USS Benfold and USS Mustin; a Los Angeles-class fast- attack submarine and a Poseidon P-8A aircraft. The Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was represented by a helicopter carrier JS Ise and its air wing; two missile destroyer JS Suzunami and JS Fuyuzuki; a Kawasaki P-1 patrol aircraft and a diesel-electric attack submarine. 2019 American, Indian, and Japanese ships participating in Malabar 2019 At the Japan-India Annual Defence Ministerial Dialogue held at Tokyo on 2 September 2019, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Japanese Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya announced that Malabar 2019 would be held in Japan from 26 September to 4 October 2019. The Indian Navy was represented by stealth frigate INS Sahyadri, AsW corvette INS Kiltan and a Boeing P-8I Neptune aircraft. The Indian Navy contingent was led by Rear Admiral Suraj Berry, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet. The U.S. Navy was represented by USS McCampbell and a Boeing P-8A Poseidon aircraft. The JMSDF was represented by helicopter destroyer JS Kaga, guided missile destroyers JS Samidare and JS Choukai, and a P1 aircraft.  2020  The 24th edition of Malabar exercise, delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is expected to be held in mid-November. It was decided that Australia shall also be a part of the Malabar Naval exercise, in view to support a free, open and rule based Indo Pacific.

E. Gurley Building is a historic industrial building in Troy, New York, United States. Built in 1862, it is a classical revival structure that housed the W. & L. E. Gurley Company, a maker of precision measuring instruments. The Gurley Company was one of the first companies in the nation to make precision instruments. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of this in 1983.  History  The Julius Hanks foundry was purchased by the W. & L. E. Gurley Company in 1852, and was destroyed in the Great Troy Fire of 1862. The W. & L. E. Gurley Building was built in \\"an amazing feat of construction\\" in just 8 months to replace the previous building. Originally, the first floor space was used for retail with the third and fourth floors leased to other manufacturers. Gradually, Gurley expanded to use the entire buildings. The company, run by William Gurley and his brother, Lewis Ephraim, were leaders in the field and published a regularly updated manual of instruments and their operations and were engaged in producing military products for the American Civil War, which included \\"brass fuse-plugs for naval projectiles and an improved type of brass trimming for saddle trees.\\" In the 1960s, the company was acquired by Teledyne Company, and was sold again in 1993 and continues as Gurley Precision Instruments today. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983. and The building is currently rented by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and houses its Lighting Research Center, which moved there in 2000, and a few acoustics labs associated with the school of architecture as well as the Human Resources department . Gurley Precision Instruments still occupies the first floor of the building and the entire building directly across the street. It is located on Fulton Street between 5th and Union Streets in Troy.  Building architecture  The building is a four-story red brick building, U-shaped around a small courtyard. A foundry was at ground level on the north side of the courtyard. The building‚Äôs foundation is made of stone with brick bearing walls and cast-iron interior columns. The building‚Äôs classical revival exterior includes arched doors and windows with semicircular brick arches and hoodmoulds. Entrances are asymmetrical with the main entrance located on Fulton Street. Originally, the first floor space was used for retail with the third and fourth floors leased to other manufacturers.

The western terminus is at U.S. Route 11 (US 11) just south of PA 492 in New Milford. The eastern terminus is at PA 547 in Gibson Township. PA 848 remains as a former portion of PA 371, which was originally designated in 1936 from New Milford to the New York state line. The highway was designated as PA 848 in 1961, seven years after it was truncated from New Milford.  Route description  New Milford Township PA 848 begins at an intersection with US 11 (Main Street) in New Milford. The route runs east towards Cobb Street, making a bend to the southeast. Passing through a residential area, the route leaves the borough of New Milford and enters the township of New Milford. The surroundings become more rural, and at the intersection with State Route 2061 (SR 2061), the route curves to the southeast into a dense forested area. PA 848 remains a two-lane road through New Milford Township. The route soon reaches SR 2063 (Far Hill Road) and later with SR 2081 (Oliver Road), which serves as the connection between Interstate 81's (I-81) exit 219 southbound and PA 848\\\\. After crossing over I-81, PA 848 intersects the northbound ramps before returning to the rural Gibson Township. After the intersection with Creek Road, PA 848 enters the village of Gibson, where it terminates at an intersection with PA 547 and Township Road 574.  History  The route of PA 848 began as an alignment of the Cochecton and Great Bend Turnpike (a portion of the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike), a 19th Century turnpike built from Great Bend, Pennsylvania to Newburgh, New York. The road was completed in Pennsylvania in 1811, five years after construction began. The turnpike did not fare after the mid-1800s, with the road abandoned in 1853. When the modern state highway system for Pennsylvania debuted in 1928, the alignment of future PA 371 was not included. In 1936, PA 371 was designated on its alignment from New Milford to the New York state line; however, this would only last sixteen years, as the Pennsylvania Department of Highways truncated PA 371 back to the intersection with PA 171 in Union Dale, further east in Susquehanna County. In April 1961, PA 848 was designated from Gibson to New Milford as part of the construction of I-81 to make sure interchanges were with numbered routes. The rest of the alignment was designated part of PA 374 from Lyon Street (west of Union Dale) to Union Dale. The rest was later designated Township Road 945 from Gibson to PA 92 intersection and SR 2034 from PA 92 to PA 374.

This makes it more difficult to treat since most hormone therapies target one of the three receptors, so triple- negative cancers often require combination therapies. Triple negative is sometimes used as a surrogate term for basal-like; however, more detailed classification may provide better guidance for treatment and better estimates for prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancers comprise a very heterogeneous group of cancers. There is conflicting information over prognosis for the various subtypes, but it appears that the Nottingham prognostic index is valid and hence general prognosis is rather similar with other breast cancer of same stage, except that more aggressive treatment is required. Some types of triple-negative breast cancer are known to be more aggressive, with poor prognosis, while other types have very similar or better prognosis than hormone receptor positive breast cancers. Among breast cancer patients, 15‚Äì20% of women have been diagnosed as triple-negative, while the majority of TNBC patients have been found to be young women or women with a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. Pooled data of all triple-negative subtypes suggests that, with optimal treatment, 20-year survival rates are very close to those of hormone positive cancer. Triple-negative breast cancers have a relapse pattern that is very different from hormone-positive breast cancers: the risk of relapse is much higher for the first 3‚Äì5 years, but drops sharply and substantially below that of hormone-positive breast cancers afterwards. This relapse pattern has been recognized for all types of triple-negative cancers for which sufficient data exist, although the absolute relapse and survival rates differ across subtypes. Cause One known cause of triple negative breast cancer is germline mutations. These are alterations within the heritable lineage that is being passed down to the offspring. Fifteen percent of TNBC can be traced back to germline mutations that are within the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (Song 2014). Due to their high disposition for cancers of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, and prostate, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified as high risk for triple-negative (Pruss 2014). Changes or mutations in 19p13.1 and MDM4 loci have also been associated with triple negative breast cancer, but not other forms of breast cancer. Thus, triple negative tumors may be distinguished from other breast cancer subtypes by a unique pattern of common and rare germline alterations (Kristen 2013). Classification Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are sometimes classified into \\"basal-type\\" and other cancers; however, there is no standard classification scheme. Basal type cancers are frequently defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and EGFR staining. However, no clear criteria or cutoff values have been standardized yet. About 75% of basal-type breast cancers are triple negative. Some TNBC overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)Feb 2009 Breast Cancer Watch or transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB). Upon histologic examination, triple-negative breast tumors mostly fall into the categories of secretory cell carcinoma or adenoid cystic types (both considered less aggressive); medullary cancers and grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas with no specific subtype; and highly aggressive metastatic cancers. Medullary TNBC in younger women are frequently BRCA1-related. Rare forms of triple-negative breast cancer are apocrine and squamous carcinoma. Inflammatory breast cancer is also frequently triple negative. Many proteins such as Caveolin 1/2, Survivin are researched as possible classification or prognostic factors. TNBCs have been classified using an integrative analysis of cancer genomics data (DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and mRNA) and PPI data from a prognostic point of view, and several key subnetworks (i.e. ubiquitin/proteasome, complement system, metabolism-related Warburg effect, ER-Golgi-cell surface trafficking, transcription) significantly related to patient survival have been identified. Treatment Standard treatment is surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As a variation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is very frequently used for triple-negative breast cancers as they are more susceptible to platinum-based regimen, allowing for a higher rate of breast-conserving surgeries. Important details on the individual responsiveness of particular cancers can be gained from evaluating the response to this form of chemotherapy. However, the improvement in breast conservation is only 10‚Äì15% and the clues to individual responsiveness have conclusively proven to make an improvement in outcomes. TNBCs are generally very susceptible to chemotherapy. In some cases, however, early complete response does not correlate with overall survival. This makes it particularly complicated to find the optimal chemotherapy. Adding a taxane to the chemotherapy appears to improve outcome substantially.{http://www.cancerjournal.net/text.asp?2018/14/3/722/179087 BRCA1-related triple-negative breast cancer appear to be particularly susceptible to chemotherapy, including platinum-based agents and taxanes. Although mutations in single genes were not individually predictive, TNBC tumors bearing mutations in genes involved in the androgen receptor (AR) and FOXA1 pathways were much more sensitive to chemotherapy. Mutations in the AR/FOXA1 pathway provide a novel marker for identifying chemosensitive TNBC patients who may benefit from current standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. Mutations that lowered the levels of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 RNA were associated with significantly better survival outcomes. This BRCA deficience signature define a new, highly chemosensitive subtype of TNBC. BRCA-deficient TNBC tumors have a higher rate of clonal mutation burden, defined as more clonal tumors with a higher number of mutations per clone, and are also associated with a higher level of immune activation, which may explain their greater chemosensitivity. Epidemiology Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for approximately 15‚Äì25% of all breast cancerVoice of Cancer Patients an online cancer patients community cases. The overall proportion of TNBC is very similar in all age groups. Younger women have a higher rate of basal or BRCA related TNBC, while older women have a higher proportion of apocrine, normal-like and rare subtypes including neuroendocrine TNBC. A study in the US says that, among younger women, African American and Hispanic women have a higher risk of TNBC, with African Americans facing worse prognosis than other ethnic groups. In 2009, a case-control study of 187 triple-negative breast cancer patients described a 2.5 increased risk for triple-negative breast cancer in women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) for more than one year, compared to women who used OCs for less than one year or never. The increased risk for triple-negative breast cancer was 4.2 among women 40 years of age or younger who used OCs for more than one year, while there was no increased risk for women between the ages of 41 and 45. Also, as duration of OC use increased, triple-negative breast cancer risk increased. Clinical research/trials Angiogenesis and EGFR (HER-1) inhibitors are frequently tested in experimental settings and have shown efficacy. Treatment modalities are not sufficiently established for normal use, and it is unclear in which stage they are best used and which patients would profit. By 2009 A number of new strategies for TNBC were being tested in clinical trials, including the PARP inhibitor BSI 201,\\"SABCS: PARP Inhibitor Data Called 'Spectacular' \\"; Dec 2009 NK012. A novel antibody-drug conjugate known as Glembatumumab vedotin (CDX-011), which targets the protein GPNMB, has also shown encouraging clinical trial results in 2009. PARP inhibitors had shown some promise in early trials but failed in some later trials. Nov 2013: An accelerated approval Phase II clinical trial (METRIC) investigating glembatumumab vedotin versus capecitabine has begun, expected to enroll 300 patients with GPNMB- expressing metastatic TNBC. Three early stage trials reported TNBC results in June 2016, for IMMU-132, Vantictumab, and atezolizumab in combination with the chemotherapy nab-paclitaxel.Finally, targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer. June 2016 In 2019, CytoDyn initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial with its humanized monoclonal antibody, leronlimab (PRO 140), in combination with chemotherapy following strong results in animal murine models. Among other mechanisms of action, leronlimab is believed to inhibit metastasis by inhibiting the CCR5 receptor on cell surfaces, which is commonly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer. On November 11, 2019, CytoDyn reported that the first TNBC patient injected under its na√Øve protocol (not previously treated for triple-negative breast cancer) demonstrated significantly reduced levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and decreased tumor size at two-week and five-week observation intervals compared to baseline observations. CTCs are a potential surrogate endpoint in oncology trials, with reduced levels suggesting long-term clinical benefit. Pre-clinical research/speculations Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) have, on average, significantly higher fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (measured by the SUVmax values) compared with uptake in ER+/PR+/HER2- tumors using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). It is speculated that enhanced glycolysis in these tumors is probably related to their aggressive biology. The widely used diabetes drug, metformin, holds promise for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In addition metformin may influence cancer cells through indirect (insulin-mediated) effects, or it may directly affect cell proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells. Epidemiologic and preclinical lab studies indicate that metformin has anti- tumor effects, via at least two mechanisms, both involving activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). A large-scale phase III trial of metformin in the adjuvant breast cancer setting is being planned in 2009. Triple-negative breast cancer cells rely on glutathione-S-transferase Pi1, and an inhibitor (LAS17) shows encouraging results in a pre-clinical study.

Started in 1955, documenta is one of the largest and most influential exhibitions of contemporary art, taking place every five years (since the 1972 edition) in the German city of Kassel. The documenta 12 magazines, conceived and directed by Georg Sch√∂llhammer, curator and editor- in-chief of Austrian magazine Springerin, invited over 90 publications - with different formats, media and orientations in the field of art, culture, and politics from around the world - to discuss about the motifs and themes of the 2007 edition. The project opened space for artists, art critics and theoreticians to plunge into an exercise of reflection on how major contemporary issues are presented in different socio-cultural contexts. The editorial team of documenta 12 magazines, run by Georg Sch√∂llhammer, included international writers, curators and art critics Heike Ander, Fouad Asfour, Maria Berrios, Cosmin Costinas, Cordula Daus, Hu Fang, and Keiko Sei. Invited two years before the exhibition (16 June-23 September 2007), the participating publications have generated over 300 articles, essays, interviews, commentaries and illustrated essays that are gathered in the documenta 12 magazines online journal, where interested readers can assemble their own individual magazine. From these contributions also came out the three printed editions published by Taschen: \\"Modernity?\\"; \\"Life!\\" and \\"Education:\\", related to the three leitmotifs of documenta 12: Is modernity our antiquity?, What is bare life? and What is to be done (Education)? This communication process continues during the hundred days of exhibition in documenta-Halle.

The kidnappings occurred over a four-month period beginning in late 2001, in which the kidnappers demanded ransom. Documents related to the case allege the crew demanded a total of more than $5.5 million from relatives and associates, and received more than $1 million from victim's relatives. Prosecutors said the victims were killed regardless of whether the ransoms were paid. The bodies were tied with weights, and dumped in the New Melones Lake near Yosemite National Park. Federal prosecutors sought the death penalty under murder during a hostage-taking, (18 U.S.C. 1203), a federal crime. On March 12, 2007, Kadamovas and Mikhel were sentenced to death. Four others were sentenced for participating in the plot, receiving sentences ranging from 11 years to life imprisonment. Background Jurijus Kadamovas was born in 1966 in Lithuania, and Iouri Gherman Mikhel was born in 1965 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Both men were foreign nationals who emigrated to the United States and lived in Los Angeles, California. They each owned a house in San Fernando Valley, with Kadamovas living in Sherman Oaks and Mikhel living in Encino. The men owned a joint business called Designed Water World, which was a fish aquarium store located on Ventura Boulevard. Murders Meyer Muscatel In October 2001, Kadamovas and Mikhel came up with a plan to lure and kidnap 58-year-old Meyer Muscatel, a local real-estate developer. Mikhel posed as a businessman interested in buying real estate. Muscatel was lured to Mikhel's house in Encino where Kadamovas and another accomplice were waiting. Muscatel was bound, handcuffed, duct-taped and pistol whipped in the head. His wallet and credit cards were taken and he was then questioned about his finances. Kadamovas and Mikhel attempted to withdraw money from his account but the bank account was frozen. Muscatel was then injected with diphenhydramine and pinned to the ground, where Mikhel placed a plastic bag over his head and suffocated him to death. Muscatel‚Äôs body was then taken in Kadamovas‚Äôs van to the New Melones Lake. The pair then tossed his body off Parrotts Ferry Bridge into the reservoir. Rita Pekler Their next target was 37-year-old George Safiev, a wealthy Russian businessman who lived in Beverly Hills. In December 2001, the pair abducted Safiev‚Äôs financial advisor, 39-year-old Rita Pekler, who was pregnant at the time. Kadamovas had contacted Pekler pretending to be interested in real estate transaction. She was lured to his Sherman Oaks home where Mikhel, armed with a handgun and stun gun, was waiting with two other accomplices. When Pekler arrived, Mikhel restrained her and told her to contact Safiev. She made contact but Safiev told her he was too busy to meet. Pekler was then injected with diphenhydramine and strangled to death. Her body was also thrown off the Parrotts Ferry Bridge into the reservoir. Alexander Umansky The third victim was 35-year-old Alexander Umansky, who owned an automobile shop. In December 2001, Mikhel posed as a customer and pretended to need audio equipment installed in several cars. Umansky was lured to the home of Kadamovas where he was ambushed. Kadamovas sat him on a chair and handcuffed him. He had his keys, telephone, and wallet taken from him and was then questioned about his finances. Umansky was held captive in the house for three days, during which he was forced to call his brother and beg for money to secure his release. Kadamovas and Mikhel also sent the Umansky family a ransom note demanding nearly $235,000. The family contacted the FBI, where they were advised to pay a part of the ransom. They later received a call in which other family members were threatened, forcing them to pay the rest of the money. The money was transferred to an account in the United Arab Emirates. The calls then stopped. After receiving the money, Kadamovas and Mikhel decided to kill Umansky. Mikhel duct-taped Umansky‚Äôs mouth shut and placed a bag over his head, while Kadamovas pinned him down and pinched his nose shut. They then twisted a rope around his neck and strangled him to death from behind. They tied a weight plate around Umansky‚Äôs body and put his corpse in Kadamovas‚Äôs van. They then drove to the New Melones Lake once again, where they threw Umansky‚Äôs body off a bridge into the reservoir. Nick Kharabadze and George Safiev In January 2002, Kadamovas and Mikhel decided to target Safiev again, as he had returned from a trip and was back in Los Angeles. They planned to get him through his business partner, 29-year-old Nick Kharabadze. Kharabadze was contacted and asked to meet at a private club, which was actually the aquarium store owned by Kadamovas and Mikhel. Kharabadze arrived at the store and was then handcuffed to a chair by Mikhel. He was ordered to call Safiev and to convince him to come to the store. Safiev arrived and was taken prisoner. Both hostages were then taken to Kadamovas's house, where they made Safiev call another business partner of his and plead with him to transfer $940,000 to a foreign account. Kharabadze and Safiev remained imprisoned in the house for four days. While held captive, Kadamovas recorded Safiev‚Äôs voice, planning to use the recordings to extort more money in the future. Mikhel eventually confirmed receipt of the $940,000, and then decided to kill the two men. They forced both the victim's to drink vodka and then took them to the reservoir in two cars. Mikhel killed Kharabadze at the reservoir by placing a plastic bag over his head and tightening a plastic tie around his throat. A weight was then tied to Kharabadze‚Äôs body and he was thrown off a bridge into the reservoir. The same thing then happened to Safiev. Investigation Muscatel‚Äôs body was found near the Parrotts Ferry Bridge by fishermen. An accomplice of Kadamovas and Mikhel learned the FBI was investigating the case and were onto him. He decided to confess and cooperated with the FBI. He helped them find the bodies of the other four victims. The FBI wire-tapped the phones of Kadamovas and Mikhel and recorded them discussing ransom money. They also secured data from their cellphones. The data showed both men had been driving north on Highway 99 toward the New Melones Lake on the days each victim had died. Other evidence linked the men to the murders. Muscatel's body had been carried to the edge of the Parrotts Ferry Bridge and was accidentally dropped on a curb where it had left blood stains. Kadamovas had also told a friend he had thrown a man off that bridge. Mikhel and an accomplice had used Umansky‚Äôs debit card to withdraw money from an ATM which had been captured on video by a surveillance camera. Mikhel had also used Kharabadze‚Äôs and Safiev‚Äôs ATM cards to withdraw money and was caught on video from surveillance cameras once again. The FBI also searched the homes of both men and found physical evidence linking them to the crimes, including ransom notes and weapons. An IRS investigator traced how the ransom payments were laundered. He discovered that the payments were laundered abroad before being deposited in accounts held by Kadamovas and Mikhel. In total, Kadamovas and Mikhel received over $1 million in ransom money from the kidnappings. Trial Both men were detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Los Angeles. A grand jury indicted Kadamovas and Mikhel on multiple counts. The government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against both men. The guilty phase of this trial began in July 2006 and spanned five months. On January 17, 2007, the jury found both defendants guilty on all counts. On March 12, 2007, both men were sentenced to death. U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian formally sentenced both men and called the murders brutal, adding that \\"the methods in which the individuals were killed, the perpetrators showed no mercy\\". Both men are currently on federal death row awaiting execution and are imprisoned at USP Terre Haute. Their death sentences were upheld in 2018.

Early career Warner was born in Woonsocket, South Dakota. He enlisted in the Navy in 1944, then was transferred to the Army the following year upon receiving an alternate appointment from South Dakota to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Graduating in 1950, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Infantry. Almost immediately after graduation, he was ordered to Korea, where he served in combat as an Infantry platoon leader in L-Company of the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. In 1953, Warner was reassigned to Europe where he served as a company commander and battalion staff officer in Trieste, Italy, Austria, and West Germany. Following attendance at the U.S. Marine Corps Advanced Course in Quantico, Virginia, Warner served a tour of duty at West Point as an instructor in the Department of Psychology and Leadership, after earning a Master of Arts Degree in Psychology from Vanderbilt University. Warner as a major general (two star) In 1963, Warner was reassigned as a Province Senior Advisor in South Vietnam. After returning from Vietnam in 1965, he served in a variety of positions in Washington, D.C., to include duty as the Military Assistant to the Special Assistant to the President for Vietnam Affairs. After earning a Masters of Science in International Relations from George Washington University, in 1969 Warner assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Returning to the Pentagon in 1970, Warner served as the Executive Officer and Senior Aide to the Army Chief of Staff. In 1972 Warner was reassigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, first as the Chief of Staff and then as the Assistant Division Commander for Operations. After a tour of duty as the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, General Warner assumed command of the 9th Infantry Division in 1975. Later in 1977, Warner assumed command of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Commander in Chief, U.S. Readiness Command In 1979 Warner assumed his duties as the Commander in Chief, Readiness Command (REDCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. His tenure as REDCOM commander coincided with the interservice debate over which unified command should have jurisdiction over the Middle East and the associated Rapid Deployment Force. In 1980, the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) was created under the command of Marine Lieutenant General Paul X. Kelley and based at MacDill Air Force Base. During planning and training exercises in the United States, the RDJTF reported to REDCOM, which was responsible for preparing United States-based Army and Air Force units for overseas deployment, but during operations the force was controlled by whichever headquarters had oversight over the territory in which it was deployed. Since the RDJTF was expected to operate mainly in the Middle East, permanent operational control over the force implied geographical responsibility for Southwest Asia. At the time, no unified command was specifically responsible for that increasingly critical region, which was divided between United States European Command and United States Pacific Command. Warner opposed proposals to assign the RDJTF to either European or Pacific Command, or to allow the RDJTF to oversee the Middle East as an autonomous command. Instead he asked that the land responsibility for Southwest Asia be returned to Readiness Command, which had overseen the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa in its previous incarnation as United States Strike Command. Meanwhile, he insisted that as long as the RDJTF was headquartered in the United States, REDCOM was its governing unified command and the RDJTF should not continue to bypass the REDCOM commander by maintaining an independent office in Washington, D.C. The interservice controversy over which unified command should control the RDJTF created friction between the REDCOM and RDJTF headquarters staffs and eventually spilled into the press, which cast the debate as a personal feud between Warner and Kelley. \\"Unfortunately, we were both caught up in the service argument as to whether it should be a premier Army or Marine force,\\" Warner said. On April 25, 1981, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger announced that the RDJTF would become a separate command with responsibility for Southwest Asia. Rebuffed in his attempt to renew the mandate of his command, Warner requested retirement, citing a lack of support from the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the debate. In parting, he observed that if the RDJTF were to be made an independent unified command, then REDCOM would be redundant and should be disestablished. The RDJTF became United States Central Command in 1983 and REDCOM was replaced by United States Special Operations Command in 1987. Post-military Warner retired from the Army on July 31, 1981. Subsequently, Warner was Vice President of Applied Technology, Vertex Systems, Incorporated, and later established V.F. Warner and Associates, a Washington- based consulting firm. He resided in McLean, Virginia. Personal life Warner's awards and decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Legion of Merit (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star with V Device (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medals with V Device, Army Commendation Medal with V Device (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Combat Infantryman Badge (2nd Award), and Master Parachutist Badge. His military education includes the Command and General Staff College in 1963; Armed Forces Staff College in 1965; and the National War College in 1969, at which time he also received a Master of Science degree in International Relations from George Washington University. Warner married Belva Janice Forbes in 1950, and had two daughters and two sons, one a retired brigadier general and the other a retired colonel. On August 18, 2005, Warner's granddaughter, First Lieutenant Laura Margaret Walker, was killed in action in Delak, Afghanistan, making her the first female West Point graduate to die in combat. Warner later come out to publicly criticize the Iraq War, and proposed pre-emptive peace as an alternative to pre-emptive war for the future. Volney Warner died on November 13, 2019 at the age of 93. The Wounded Knee Siege of 1973 While serving as Chief of Staff to the 82nd Airborne Division, Warner was seconded to the White House by General Alexander Haig, then Chief of Staff to President Nixon. Warner was to serve as the senior federal representative to address the standoff at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Warner successfully resolved the issue without blood shed. Attorney Kenneth Tilsen, representing the American Indian Movement, commented that \\"Warner was the only one who really knew what he was doing...\\". Boots on the ground Warner is credited with coining the phrase \\"boots on the ground\\", to mean the actual forces engaged in a conflict. The first use of the phrase is identified as a quote in the Christian Science Monitor (April 11, 1980) in reference to the Iran hostage crisis: \\"US options grow more difficults as the chance of a Soviet response increases. However, many American strategists now argue that even light, token US land forces -- 'getting US combat boots on the ground' as General Warner puts it -- would signal to an enemy that the US is physically guarding the area and can only be dislodged at the risk of war.\\" References External links * Afghanistan: Context and What's Next, by Volney F.

Lucien was best known for his song \\"Rashida\\", the title track of an album released in 1973, and one of two Grammy nominated songs on that album. He was also well known for his cover of \\"Dindi\\" by Brazilian composer Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. His smooth baritone drew comparisons with Nat King Cole and Lou Rawls. He was often heard on traditional jazz stations in the United States such as WJZZ in Detroit, Michigan (now WDMK). Life and career Lucien was born on the island of Tortola in 1942, and raised in St. Thomas by a guitar-playing dad and greatly inspired by Nat \\"King\\" Cole. Arriving in New York by the mid-60s, he set about sharing the music in his head with the world at large. His 1970 RCA debut, I Am Now, was a formative step in the direction for which he would subsequently be known, presenting him as a romantic crooner with an exotic accent, but sticking largely to string-laden easy-listening arrangements. By the release of his second album, Rashida, in 1973, he had arrived at his artistic cruising speed, creating a style of R and B where the \\"B\\" stood more for bossa nova than blues, with languid samba rhythms, understated nylon-string acoustic guitar, fluid bass lines and his trademark unique scatting, occasionally eschewing lyrics altogether. This approach yielded a number of classic cuts like \\"Would You Believe In Me,\\" \\"Lady Love\\" and the title track, which all found a home on the airwaves in those waning days of progressive FM. For the follow-up, 1974's Mind's Eye, Lucien and producer Dave Grusin crafted an album that fulfilled and expanded upon Rashida's promise, a scintillating song cycle combining the diverse sources of Lucien's inspiration in a seamless manner. Unfortunately, this album would mark the beginning of Lucien's rather adversarial relationship with the music business establishment, with tracks like \\"Listen Love\\" and \\"World Of Joy\\" being considered too hard to pigeonhole for any one radio format. A move to CBS the following year yielded Song For My Lady, an effort to reach the broader audiences that had proven elusive to his previous RCA efforts. Recorded with an array of studio session heavy-hitters, Song fared somewhat better, with \\"Creole Lady\\" receiving significant air play on the AC format of the era, although still falling a bit short of making Lucien a household name. The album remains, however, fondly remembered by all who have heard it, as does its 1976 follow-up, Premonition, featuring such evergreen favorites as \\"Laura\\" and \\"Hello Like Before\\" with a similar stellar session lineup. After two albums, however, it became increasingly apparent that CBS scarcely understood Lucien's music and where he was trying to go with it better than RCA, especially with the disco onslaught then beginning to take place. Feeling a tad disillusioned that music as easily likable as his should experience such difficulties gaining a wider and wider audience, Lucien stopped recording for a while and was not heard from again until the release of 1991's Listen Love on Mercury, followed by 1993's Mother Nature's Son. Both albums went a long way toward refreshing his original fans' memories of his unique artistry, picking up some new ones along the way as well. Jon explains: \\"Wherever I perform, I hear all the time, 'I'm 18, I'm 19, but my mom turned me on to your music when I was 10, and this is the first chance I got to see you.'\\" After a four-year absence from the recording studio, Lucien returned to debut Endless Is Love for Shanachie. The spiritual warmth and romantic grace that have always been Jon's trademarks are even more powerful and profound permeating the songs and enveloping the listener in a mood best described as peaceful intensity on this release. A few months after his 17-year-old daughter Dalila perished on Flight 800 in July 1996, Jon went into the studio and began recording Endless Is Love. His music has always been his sanctuary. \\"My daughter doesn't want me sitting around being unhappy. I look at her and we communicate. We make music. The music is a special force.\\" And Lucien's message hasn't wavered since his earliest days. \\"I hope to heal people who are sad and spiritually dead, because even though I don't pray in the music, the spirit is still there.\\" 1999 marked the issue of four new CDs: Jon Lucien's own production, By Request for Shanachie, and the compilations of some of Lucien's classic recorded material under the titles of Sweet Control -The Best of Jon Lucien (Razor and Tie/BMG) Love Everlasting - The Very Best of Jon Lucien (BMG/Camden UK) and Precious Is Love (Arts Records International) - all compilations taken from previously recorded material over the years. Love Everlasting... and Precious... containing several never-released cuts from original recording dates back in the '69 and early '70 days of youth and exuberance. The simultaneous release of these four CDs on four different labels is further evidence of Lucien's vision and his appeal that bridges generations and genres of musical tastes. 2001 signaled a new era for Jon Lucien with the release of Lucien Romantico on Jon's own Sugar Apple label. \\"This,\\" he says, \\"opens up an entirely new avenue for me, now along with so many of my unreleased music compositions, I can also expose and introduce new talent of quality.\\" Released in 2002, Man From Paradise, is all original material with a Caribbean Roots feel, songs such as \\"Let's Go To The Carnival\\" makes you want to march along in the parade. \\"My Passion's\\" steel drum, played by Andy Narell, and dramatic lyrics by Maria Juliana Villafane, helps to display Lucien's deep passion for love. In this package Jon exposes his many talents as an instrumentalist, his arranging abilities as well as his unlimited vocal styles. 2003 brings the first live performance of his entire career, Live in NYC. If you thought you knew Jon Lucien, now is a good time to discover how he commands many genres of music. You can't \\"pigeon-hole\\" Jon Lucien, he just makes good music. He has garnered younger fans through samplings from the old albums turning up regularly in hip-hop and acid jams, and mint copies of Rashida and Mind's Eye exchanging hands at often absurd prices. It is a testament to that vision and vindication of his commercial struggle that his audience now encompasses jazz buffs, R and B fans, acid- jazzers, world music types and fair-weather music fans in between all of the above, all of whom continued to pack his shows in the later years. All drawn by the sound...THAT sound...the Jon Lucien sound. A \\"Best Of\\" compilation of his earlier work was released in 2001. Jon Lucien died in Orlando, Florida, on August 18, 2007, from respiratory failure and other complications following surgery at the age of 65. Almost seven years to the day, his wife Delesa died August 20, 2014. She was Jon‚Äôs business partner and muse for so many of his '90s hit songs. Delesa handled many details including management of Sugar Apple Music, singing backup vocals for his songs and documenting his work. Jon is survived by his son, and daughter, Celesa Jane Lucien; granddaughter, Misty Rene Incontrera and Great grandsons, Alexander H. Singleton and Wilder M. Incontrera.

The western terminus is at PA 74 in Saville Township. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 22 (US 22)/US 322 in Reed Township, Dauphin County near Duncannon. PA 849 winds east from PA 74 through farms and woods to Newport, where it forms a concurrency with PA 34. From Newport, the route heads southeast through more rural land to Duncannon, where it turns east and crosses the Juniata River to reach its terminus at US 22/US 322 just north of the Susquehanna River. PA 849 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 in Saville Township east to PA 5 (now PA 34) in Newport. The same year, the present route between Duncannon and US 22 became part of PA 33. In 1937, PA 849 was extended east from Newport to PA 14 (which replaced PA 33) in Duncannon. US 11/US 15 replaced the PA 14 designation on the road between Duncannon and US 22/US 322 in 1941. PA 849 was extended east to its current end at US 22/US 322 in the 1950s after US 11/US 15 were moved to a bypass of Duncannon. Route description PA 849 begins at an intersection with PA 74 in the community of Roseburg in Saville Township, Perry County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Buffalo Trace. The route passes through wooded areas with some fields, following the Buffalo Creek and passing through Eschol. The road heads into Tuscarora Township and becomes Buckwheat Valley Road, turning southeast onto Creek Road a short distance later. PA 849 crosses into Juniata Township and winds through more areas of farmland and woodland along the Buffalo Creek, heading east through Walnut Grove. The road curves to the northeast and reaches Markelsville, where the route turns north to remain on Creek Road. The route winds northeast through more rural areas alongside the creek, turning east as it heads into more agricultural areas with some woods and reaches the community of Wila. At this point, PA 849 turns south before curving back to the east, running through more rural areas. The road enters Oliver Township and turns northeast into wooded areas before a turn to the southeast into residential areas. The route heads east prior to turning south onto 4th Street, heading into Newport. Here, PA 849 becomes North 4th Street and passes homes and businesses, reaching an intersection with PA 34. At this junction, PA 34 turns south to form a concurrency with PA 849, heading through more developed areas. The road turns south to head back into Oliver Township and become Keystone Way, heading through wooded areas. PA 849 splits from PA 34 by heading southeast on Newport Road, passing through areas of farms and woods with some homes. The route heads south into forested areas of mountains, crossing into Miller Township, where it turns east and then south to wind across the mountains. The road curves east near a few homes before heading south through more forested mountains. PA 849 turns to the east again and heads through more wooded areas with some fields and homes, curving to the southeast. The road passes near another forested mountain, turning south into Wheatfield Township and curving southwest. The route turns east past a few rural homes prior to heading southeast through agricultural areas with some residences. PA 849 makes a turn to the south and crosses into Penn Township, running through more rural areas and passing over the US 11/US 15 freeway. The road heads through woodland and becomes the border between Duncannon to the southwest and Penn Township to the northeast, passing homes. The route turns east onto Juniata Road, following the Appalachian Trail, and fully enters Penn Township again, running through wooded areas and passing under Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line. PA 849 crosses the Juniata River into Reed Township in Dauphin County and reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 22/US 322 just north of the Clarks Ferry Bridge over the Susquehanna River, where the Appalachian Trail turns south to cross the river on the Clarks Ferry Bridge. This intersection has no direct access from PA 849 to US 22/US 322 westbound; access is provided by way of a U-turn at the PA 147 interchange on the other side of the Susquehanna River. History When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 849 was not given a number. PA 849 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 southeast of Ickesburg east to PA 5 (now PA 34) in Newport along an unpaved road. The section of the route running from Duncannon across the Juniata River to US 22 was designated as part of PA 33, which was paved. By 1930, a small section of the route to the west of Newport was paved. In 1937, PA 849 was extended east from Newport to PA 14 (Market Street) in Duncannon, with PA 14 replacing PA 33 on the road from Duncannon over the Juniata River to US 11/US 22/US 322. The entire length of PA 849 was paved in the 1930s. In 1941, US 11/US 15 replaced PA 14 on the segment of road between Duncannon and US 22/US 322. In the 1950s, US 11/US 15 were rerouted to bypass Duncannon to the west, and PA 849 was extended east on the former alignment across the Juniata River to end at US 22/US 322.

Seward House Museum is a historic house museum at 33 South Street in Auburn, New York. Built about 1816, the home of William H. Seward (1801-72), who served as a New York state senator, the governor of New York, a U.S. senator, a presidential candidate, and then Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It is now maintained by nonprofit organization as a museum dedicated to Seward's legacy. Description The Seward House is located south of the center of Auburn, on the west side of South Street opposite Grover Street. Its core element is a two-story brick structure, with a gabled roof. To this house William Seward made numerous additions, beginning with a two-story tower and wing at the west end in 1847, to which a porte-cochere and carriage house were added. In 1866, he added another narrower wing and three-story tower to the south side of the house, and additional separate carriage houses were built further south on the property. History The core of the house was built in 1816 by Judge Elijah Miller, Seward's father-in-law. Much of the actual construction of the house was done by the carpenter John C. Jeffries as well as his apprentice Brigham Young, who later became the leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The house remained in the hands of Seward's descendants until 1951, when it was turned over to a nonprofit for conversion to a museum. Among other notable accomplishments, Seward negotiated the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia , which became known as \\"Seward's Folly\\". Although he spent many years in Albany and Washington, D.C., he called this house his home from the time of his marriage in 1824 until his death. The entire house remains furnished with extensive Seward-family collections.

As originally raised in 1846, The Guides consisted of infantry and cavalry. It evolved through the 20th century to become the Guides Cavalry and Guides Infantry. Once independence was granted to India and after the partition, The Guides were given over to Pakistan and became part of the Pakistan Army with all ranks including officers being recruited solely from Pakistan. The regiment exists as 2nd Battalion (The Guides) of the Frontier Force Regiment of the Pakistan Army. History 310px The brainchild of Sir Henry Lawrence, the Corps had Lt. Harry Lumsden as its commandant and W.S.R. Hodson (the Hodson of Hodson's Horse) as second-in-command. On 6 February 1847 Lumsden wrote to his father \\" I have just been nominated to raise the corps of Guides. It will be the finest appointment in the country\\".'Lumsden of the Guides'(London, 1899) by P. Lumsden and G. Elsmie; p.28. A few months later, on 16 September 1847 Hodson wrote to his brother \\"..of my good fortune... I am to be the Second-in-Command with the Corps of Guides\\".'Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India; being extracts from the letters of the late Major W.S.R. Hodson' (London, 1859), edited by George H. Hodson; p.47. The Corps had modest beginnings. When it was raised at Kalu Khan, on the Yusufzai Plain, in the Peshawar Valley region by Lt. Lumsden in December 1846, it comprised just one troop of cavalry and two companies of infantry. The first action was at Mughdara, in the Panitar Hills. Within two years, the small force of Guides had established a name for itself, under Lumsden, its founder, and Hodson. When the Second Sikh War broke out in 1848, the unit was given authorisation for a three-fold increase in size, to six companies of infantry and three troops of cavalry. The Guides maintained the 'cavalry and infantry combined in the same regiment' organisation for many years, and even when split into two separate components, the name lingered in both elements. The Corps of Guides became the garrison unit of a key post on the frontier, the new fort of (Hoti ~) Mardan. The building of the fort in 1854 was organised and supervised by Hodson'Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India; being extracts from the letters of the late Major W. S. R. Hodson' (London, 1859), edited by George H. Hodson; pp 149, 153 who had been promoted commandant of the regiment in 1852.'Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India; being extracts from the letters of the late Major W.S.R. Hodson' (London, 1859), edited by George H. Hodson; p.128 In 1857 the unit was called urgently to help relieve the Siege of Delhi. In just over three weeks the Guides marched nearly six hundred miles during the hottest month of the year, crossing five great rivers and fighting four small actions. The march coincided with the month of Ramadan meaning that the muslim soldiers in the force could neither eat nor drink during the hours of daylight. On arrival at Delhi, the force of 600 Guides were almost immediately called upon to join the defence of the city. Men who had just completed a march of some 580 miles were thrown into a battle of such intensity that no fewer than 350 of the 600 became casualties within an hour of their arrival in Delhi. The Corps of Guides was part of the Frontier Force brigade and developed a reputation of being an elite unit. They were the first unit in the Indian or British Armies to dress in \\"khaki\\" uniform, first introduced in 1848.\\"Khaki Uniform 1848‚Äì49: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004) pp 341‚Äì347 Typically, the Guides were often used in small detachments, usually supported by other Frontier Force troops. The designations of the Corps of Guides changed over time as follows: * The Corps of Guides (1846) * The Corps of Guides, Punjab Irregular Force (1857) * Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force (1865) * Queen's Own Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force (1876) * Queen's Own Corps of Guides (1901) * Queen's Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden's) (1904) * Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) (Lumsden's) (1911).Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 964 In 1911 the cavalry and infantry components were designated as such. The cavalry then became, successively:- * Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) (Lumsden's) Cavalry (1911) * 10th Queen Victoria's Own Corps Of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force) (1922) * The Guides Cavalry (10th Queen Victoria's Own Frontier Force) (1927)Gaylor, p.81 and the infantry:- * Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) (Lumsden's) Infantry (1911) * 5th Bn (QVO Corps of Guides) 12th Frontier Force Regiment (1922)Gaylor, p. 171-2 Post- World War II In 1945, the 12th Frontier Force Regiment was renamed the Frontier Force Regiment and on independence and the partition of India it was allocated to Pakistan. The cavalry regiment was also allocated to Pakistan and was renamed the Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force). In 1957, the Frontier Force Rifles and The Pathan Regiment were amalgamated with the Frontier Force Regiment to form a new Frontier Force Regiment. The Guides battalion became the 2nd battalion of the new regiment. Uniform The Guides wore a scarlet facing colour on the collars and cuffs of their khaki uniforms from their establishment in 1846. Major R.M. Barnes, pp. 180‚Äì181 \\"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\\", Sphere Books Ltd London, 1972 Accordingly both The 10th Guides Cavalry (FF) and the 2nd Battalion (The Guides) of the Frontier Force Regiment of the Pakistan Army still wear red piping on the collars of their modern dress uniforms.

The administrative center of the Gurage Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), this town has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation between 1910 and 1935 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by Kebena woreda and it was part of former Goro woreda. According to the Gurage Zone government, Welkite is one of 12 towns with electrical power, one of 11 with telephone service and one of nine that have postal service.Gurage Zone Socio-Economic Profile Gurage Zone Government web page (accessed 4 September 2007) The SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, adds that Welkite also had a bank branch and other financial institutions, as well as a hospital.\\"Detailed statistics on hotels and tourism\\", Bureau of Finance and Economic Development website (accessed 4 September 2009) An all-weather road was built in 1963 which connects Welkite to Addis Ababa by way of Endibir.\\"Ethiopian Village Studies: Imbdibir\\", Centre for the Study of African Economies (accessed 5 July 2009) At Welkite an extreme example of an attempt at eviction of tenants before the Ethiopian revolution is reported to have occurred. A retired colonel living in the area held title to 4,000 hectares, which some 500 tenants cultivated. Following a fertilizer demonstration by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization in 1969, the colonel decided to introduce modernized farming. At first he decided to modernize rapidly and announced that he was going to terminate the tenancy relationships with all of his tenants. The tenants, however, are said to have responded violently, attempting to stone their landlord one night as he left a bar in Welkite. The colonel then changed tactics, modernizing his lands piecemeal and evicting smaller numbers of tenants. By 1972 he had 160 hectares under tractor cultivation, and 140 tenant families were said to have been evicted. These people did not, however, leave the area, relying on the ensete cultivations around their houses for a minimum of food.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 19 November 2007) History The town has well over 150 years of ages.

The mountain is a popular hiking spot in western Maine, with trailheads located on Byron Road in unincorporated Township 6, north of Weld. It is distinguished by an alpine pond (known locally as Crater Lake or Tumbledown Pond) just below the summit. Tumbledown Mountain is also located near Coos Canyon, a mountain stream. Tumbledown offers trails of varying difficulty for different hikers. Less strenuous routes The least strenuous route to the summit is to hike to Tumbledown pond via either the Brook or Parker Ridge trails. From the pond, hikers can access the summit via the Tumbledown Ridge Trail, a fairly well marked path that leads across the mountaintop all the way from the East Peak to the West Peak. It also connects to the Loop Trail, which descends steeply back to Byron Road. Weaker hikers should avoid the Loop Trail, as it can be a very challenging hike.http://mainelyhiking.com/tumbledown.htm Brook Trail: The Brook trail begins approximately 4.5 miles down Byron Road. It is one of the most popular routes up Tumbledown. There is a large parking area located across the road from the trailhead, along with an outhouse for public use. The trail itself initially follows an old logging road before steeply ascending the mountain to Tumbledown pond. It is roughly 2.5 miles in length and takes approximately 2 hours to hike at a brisk pace. Parker Ridge Trail: This trail is the oldest route to the pond. It gradually rises through the woods before leading up a steep, rocky ridgeline, then down to Tumbledown Pond. In the past, to access this route, hikers had to travel into the woods on a private road called the Morgan Road, and park near a place locally known as \\"Tumbledown Field.\\" Tumbledown Field and the land surrounding it is all privately owned, and hikers are no longer encouraged to use the Morgan Road. Instead, hikers can now access Parker Ridge Trail directly from the Brook Trail parking lot. It is approximately a one-mile walk to the Parker Ridge trailhead from the Brook Trail parking lot. Hikers can also access the trail leading up Little Jackson Mountain from here as well. Total distance to the pond (including the access trail) is about 3.2 miles. More challenging routes View from the summit of Tumbledown Mountain, showing Crater Lake (left) and Lake Webb (right) Loop Trail: The Loop Trail begins roughly 5.8 miles down the Byron Road roughly 1.5 miles beyond the Brook Trail. The trailhead is well - marked and provides a good parking area. This route is one of the most direct paths to the summit, as it rises steeply up the mountainside, eventually intersecting with the Tumbledown Ridge Trail, which provides access to the mountain's peaks. The trail itself is 2 rugged miles, and provides stunning views of the Tumbledown cliffs approximately one mile in. From there, the trail rises very steeply up a gully and requires a lot of boulder scrambling. Near the end, the trail actually goes up through a fissure between several boulders, creating a steep, chimney - like passage referred to in most guidebooks and web pages as \\"Fat Man's misery,\\". There are several iron rungs to assist hikers, but you must remove your backpack in order to fit through it. This makes having a partner very helpful. Claustrophobics should not climb this trail, nor should individuals who struggle with heights. Descending this trail is extremely tough and a bit dangerous. Hikers are better off ascending the Loop Trail and descending to the pond via Tumbledown Ridge Trail. From there, you can hike back to the Byron Road via the Brook Trail. The actual \\"Fat Man's Misery\\" is downhill and to the left of \\"The Chimney,\\" is poorly marked, and opens into a cliff face. Tumbledown Chimney Trail: This trail is considered derelict and should be avoided. It leaves the Loop Trail roughly one mile in, traveling through an extremely rough boulder field. From there, the trail climbs a severely steep, smooth rock slope. Eventually, it reaches the Tumbledown Chimney, which is approximately 15 feet high and very steep. A hand - over - hand climb via a fixed line is required to reach the top. Although the trail is still identified in some older guidebooks, it does not appear to be maintained any longer. Tumbledown is now regularly patrolled by rangers. Hikers should realize that climbing this trail is quite risky due to its steepness. Slabs of rock regularly fall here. An injury can leave a hiker in serious trouble on this mountain. In 2009, a new rope was installed at the top of the Chimney Trail. As of December 2009, it was a purple synthetic rope tied off to the second of several iron rungs at the top. The trail itself is still unmaintained and hard to follow above the cliff wall and presumably the same below.

Biography According to Houbraken, Seiter was born on the border of Switzerland and brought up in Vienna. It is unknown who his first teacher was, but as a young man he crossed the alps to Venice, where he apprenticed with Johann Carl Loth. He copied his style so well, that even at the time Houbraken was writing (1718), it was impossible to tell whether a painting was by him or Lott. He then moved to Rome to work in the studio of Carlo Maratta, and while there, he joined the Bentvueghels and received the bent nickname of Morgenstar.Daniel Syder biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His Martyrdom of St Catherine (1685) and Martyrdom of St Lawrence remained on its original place, the side walls of the vestibule of the Cybo Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. Becoming successful in Rome, he married a bookseller's daughter and won a lucrative commission from Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. The Duke's son Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia commissioned him in turn to decorate the Royal Palace of Turin in 1675, when he became duke after his father died. He liked Seiter's work so much that he knighted him. Today there is still a gallery there named after him. He also helped decorate in fresco the cupola of the chapel of the Ospedale Maggiore. Seiter followed Victor Amadeus on his travels, and painted in Brunswick and Dresden. Trivia Royal Palace of Turin. In his biography of Seiter, Houbraken tells a curious anecdote about the Duke and Seiter, saying that Seiter was given a walking cane with diamonds on the head of it, to use as a maulstick to rest his hand on while painting. This story was told to him by a painter named Le Blon. He calls it a Maalstok. When Seiter was done painting he tried to give it back, but the Duke's guard told him to keep it as a token of regard. A similar expensive gift (it was solid gold) was given to Daniel Seghers by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange in exchange for a garland painting that hangs today in the Mauritshuis museum. Though details of his career are sketchy, Seiter became a painter for the Dukes of Savoy much later than 1655, and thus was not a witness to his patron's murderous massacre of the Vaudois, which the poet John Milton memorialized in his On the Late Massacre in Piedmont. Seiter died in Turin.

Magnetic water treatment is regarded as unproven and unscientific. Effectiveness Vendors of magnetic water treatment devices frequently use pictures and testimonials to support their claims, but omit quantitative detail and well-controlled studies. Advertisements and promotions generally omit system variables, such as corrosion or system mass balance analyticals, as well as measurements of post- treatment water such as concentration of hardness ions or the distribution, structure, and morphology of suspended particles. Hypothesized mechanisms Duration of exposure and field strength, gradient, rate of change, and orientation along or perpendicular to flow are variously cited as important to the results. Magnetic water treatment proponent Klaus Kronenberg proposed that the shapes of solute lime molecules are modified by strong magnetic fields, leading them to precipitate as spherical or round crystals rather than deposit as sheets or platelets of hard crystals. Simon Parsons of the School of Water Sciences at Cranfield University proposed that the magnetic field reduces the surface charge on small particles, increasing the tendency to coagulate as large particles that stay with the flow rather than depositing as scale. However, an internal study in 1996 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory found no difference in preferred crystal structure of scale deposited in magnetic water treatment systems. Liu et al. and Coey and Cass published research in 2010 and 2000 reporting that magnetic treatment causes water containing minerals to favor formation of a more soluble form of calcium carbonate (aragonite rather than calcite). Pipe material The effect of magnetic treatment depends on properties of the pipe. The magnititude of the effect depends on pipe conductivity and surface roughness.

It is a small brick Italianate building now annexed to a more modern school building. In 1976 it was designated a National Historic Landmark for its association with James Hall (1811-1898), a leading American geologist of the 19th century. It is one of the few buildings remaining from a brief period of collaboration between Andrew Jackson Downing and Calvert Vaux. Hall, a paleontologist, led research on the geology of North America during the 19th century. He spent much of his time working in this small building, which served him as both office and laboratory. Among his many discoveries here, Hall found that the stromatolite fossils discovered at Petrified Sea Gardens, a site near Saratoga Springs, also a National Historic Landmark, were originally organic. and In the late 20th century it was expanded slightly and annexed to one of Albany's elementary schools. It served that purpose until 2011. After voters approved the school district's plan to sell it, the building and annex is pending purchase by the Boys and Girls Club of Albany. Building The former office is located on the northwest corner of the building, in the southwest portion of the park. One of the park's internal access roads, to the south, provides access to a parking lot on the west. Beyond it, Morton Avenue is 300 ft (100 m) to the south. On the west is a large octagonal children's swimming pool, basketball court and tennis courts along Delaware Avenue (U.S. Route 9W). To the north is another, larger school. A wooded area past it buffers the park from the Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark Historic District to the north. Eastward, the park extends for another half- mile (800 m) to Eagle Street, sloping gently down toward the Hudson River a mile (1.6 km) further to the east. The South End‚ÄìGroesbeckville Historic District begins along Morton just southeast of Eagle. The building itself is a one-story three-by-four-bay brick structure with a gently pitched front-gabled roof. A small tower is at its southeast corner, topped by a flat roof pierced by a brick chimney. On its east it is joined to the school building for the entire length. A stairway to the basement, with modern metal guardrail, is cut into the pavement at the southwest corner. It has been painted white, which has begun to fade and flake off, with green trim. A string course of projecting brick divides the basement and first story. Windows are all set with six-over-six double-hung sash. All have simple sills of brick; the central window on the south (front) facade has a similar lintel. The main entrance is located to its east. Above that central window is a commemorative plaque. It is topped by a pair of smaller windows, segmentally arched in splayed brick. At the roofline is a molded cornice. The tower has a stringcourse separating its top and bottom stages, with a single segmental- arched window similar to those on the south facade on each of its faces. Small brackets hold up the cornice. History A Massachusetts native, James Hall came to the Capital District to study under Amos Eaton at what is now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy. Hall also went on field expeditions led by Ebenezer Emmons, which along with Eaton led him to choose geology as a career. After working at the RPI library following graduation, he began working with the state's newly established geological survey, which became his lifelong career. After a groundbreaking 1843 report on the state's fourth district which established him as one of the nation's leading stratigraphers and paleontologists, the survey asked him to do a paleontological report on the entire state. The resulting eight-volume, 13-part report, considered an American scientific classic, was not published until 1894, four years before his death. During that time he was appointed the state geologist for not only New York but Iowa and Wisconsin as well, and the director of the New York State Museum. alt=A black-and-white photographic portrait of a bearded, white-haired bespectacled man, shown from the chest up His work consisted primarily of reviewing and inspecting fossil and rock samples, not just from New York but the entire country. By 1850 he had run out of storage space at his state office, so he had this building constructed for the exclusive use of himself and his assistants. Andrew Jackson Downing and his student Calvert Vaux were collaborating at the time, and designed it in the Italian villa style the former had popularized. It closely matches one drawing in Downing's influential pattern book, The Architecture of Country Houses. The two architects' collaboration ended with Downing's death in a steamboat accident on the Hudson in 1852, the year the building was finished. It is one of the few extant works credited to both Downing and Vaux. In the 1880s, Hall had a house for his family built nearby. He nevertheless spent so much time working in the office, sometimes sleeping there, that he and his family grew distant. In 1885 the state insisted he work out of one of its offices; however he continued to spend a great deal of his time at the 1852 office until he died 13 years later. Its interior, essentially one large room at the time, was lined with charts, specimens and books. Off to one side was his spartan bedroom. By 1916 the city had acquired the building. That year the geological survey had the plaque, commemorating Hall's life and work in the building, affixed. At some point during the intervening 60 years between then and its National Historic Landmark designation, it began being used as a school. It was annexed to the Sunshine School building shortly after that. The school remained open until 2011. Shortly after it was closed, the Albany City School District agreed to sell the building to the Boys & Girls Club of Albany. The sale is still pending See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in New York *National Register of Historic Places listings in Albany, New York References External links *Castle Island Montessori School website Category:National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Albany County, New York Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1852 Category:Montessori schools in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany, New York ","title":"James Hall Office"},{"id":"13103862","text":"Butajira () is a town and separate woreda in south-central Ethiopia. Located at the base of the Zebidar massif in the Gurage Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, this town has an elevation of 2131 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by Meskane woreda. It was part of former Meskanena Mareko woreda.  Overview  Gurage man with a slingshot in Butajira.

After Ras Desta Damtew was taken prisoner on 24 February 1937 in the small village of Eya he was brought to Butajira where, after a perfunctory trial, he was executed that evening. British patrols, acting as part of the East African Campaign, found that arbegnoch groups had dispersed the local Italian positions, leading to both the British and Ethiopian flags being raised over the town on 21 April 1941.  Demographics  Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this town has a total population of 33,406, of whom 16,923 are men and 16,483 women. The majority of the inhabitants were reported as Muslim, with 51.27% of the population reporting that belief, while 39.58% practice Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 8.72% were Protestants.Census 2007 Tables: Southern Peoples, Nations and Nationalities Region , Tables 2.1, and 3.4.

They have released three studio albums, several touring EP's, toured extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe, and played in various other bands / live acts. Roman Candle was founded in 1997 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The band, who all attended UNC-Chapel Hill, recorded and performed there for 10 years before moving to Nashville, TN in 2008. History Roman Candle started playing shows around Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1997. Most early shows involved (current band members) Skip and Logan Matheny and various musicians from around town sitting in. Eventually a regular lineup formed, including Skip's wife Timshel on fender rhodes and farfisa. They sold over 400 copies of a self-released cd of demos in 2000 on consignment at Chapel Hill's SchoolKids Records, and signed to Trevor Pryce's Outlook Music Company in October 2001. When they signed their first record deal, Skip and Timshel were working in Portland Oregon as a forklift driver and a dishwasher at an art college (respectively). Their record \\"Says Pop\\" was released by Outlook in May 2002. The band toured across the U.S. in support of Says Pop, gathered an enthusiastic fanbase, and were named in Rolling Stone magazine, as Chapel Hill's \\"darling\\" band on the rise. During this time they met producer Chris Stamey (The db's, Yo la tengo, Ryan Adams, R.E.M.), and signed to Hollywood Records' fledgling college music division (also signed, were The Polyphonic Spree and Patrick Park). Hollywood recruited Stamey to rework the songs on Says Pop, for a major label release, re-titled \\"The Wee Hours Revue\\" in 2003. However, Hollywood, uncertain about the \\"college division\\" of their label, decided to shelve Roman Candle's album for 2 years. During this time, the band continued to tour, write and record music, and became a part of Chris Stamey's \\"mod squad,\\" a famed group of studio / touring musicians around Stamey's studio, Modern Recording. Roman Candle band members toured in support of Stamey's records, \\"A Question of Temperature\\" (with Yo la Tengo) and \\"Travels in the South\\". The band became known for their live shows (described as \\"Jaw-Dropping\\",), and after opening up for The Soundtrack of Our Lives, lead singer Ebbot Lundberg called them from the stage \\"the best opening act he'd seen in years.\\" Also during this time, singer/songwriter Thad Cockrell, gave a copy of the record to famed BBC DJ Bob Harris (radio). He called the record, on the air, one of the best rock and roll records he'd heard in years. Harris has since invited RC to play on his BBC Radio 2 show multiple times. In 2006 V2 Records bought \\"The Wee Hours Revue\\" masters from Hollywood and released the record to widespread acclaim in June 2006‚Äîincluding praise from The Boston Globe, Pitchfork Media, and making Paste's Top 100 album's of 2006 -- They were no. 38. Editor of Paste (magazine) Josh Jackson even cited the album as one of the top 10 most overlooked albums of 2006. Even as late after the release as April 2007, Harp Magazine, journalist Mark Kemp named The Wee Hours Revue One of the best roots-rock records of the decade. The band toured throughout 2006 in support of the record, including tours with The Whigs, The Avett Brothers, Bird Monster, Indigo Girls, Aimee Mann, The Psychedelic Furs and a date at Radio City Music Hall. In 2007 they continued to tour the U.S. and the U.K., including a pair of live performances on BBC radio 2. In November 2008, the band announced from their website that they had signed to a new label, Carnival Recording Company, and that they would be releasing 4 eps, accompanying the release of their next full-length. The first of these ep's, \\"Eden was a Garden\\" was released in digital and vinyl formats on Dec. 4, 2008. The second ep \\"They Say\\" was released on March 9, 2009. Their album \\"Oh Tall Tree in the Ear,\\" was released on May 12, 2009. The title is taken from Rainer Maria Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus. The band embarked on a Paste Magazine / WOXY sponsored tour in support of the record with The Deep Vibration, and continued to tour throughout 2009 playing almost a hundred shows, including dates with Iron and Wine, Wild Beasts, Jason Isbell and others. In August 2013, the band announced they would be releasing a their next studio album. \\"Debris\\" released on October 28, 2013. \\"Drinks With\\" Interviews In October 2009, Skip and Timshel started an artist-on-artist interview series, called \\"Drinks with\\" for American Songwriter. The content of the series is mostly about songs and songwriting, and there have been interviews with performers such as the Arctic Monkeys, Tom T. Hall, The xx, Alejandro Escovedo, Julian Casablancas, and Phoenix (band). In 2013 the series was extended the series to visual artists, writers and comedians, published in Paste Magazine, and has included David Sedaris, Colin Meloy and Carson Ellis, Kevin Nealon, Makoto Fujimura and Bruce Herman.

Early life and family Izeta Selimoviƒá was born on 27 March 1936 in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina, while it was a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Selimoviƒá family originally hails from Bileƒáa. Being the youngest of five children in a Muslim Bosniak family, she was called beba (baby) by her older siblings and took that as her stage name when she became a professional singer. At the age of seven, Selimoviƒá moved to Sarajevo with her family in 1943, during World War II, where she completed her schooling. Career Aged 17, she was one of six people chosen out of 300 candidates to sing for Radio Sarajevo, which kicked off her professional career in 1954 as a soloist for the station. Her first single, \\"Po mojoj ba≈°ti zumbuli cvjetaju\\" (\\"In My Garden Hyacinths Bloom\\"), was released in 1958. Selimoviƒá retired in 1988 following the release of her final studio album. Although her recorded songs have appeared on many compilation albums since the late 1980s, she did not record any new music since then. During her long career, she sang exclusively in two genres: Bosnian folk and sevdalinka. She recorded songs with multiple Bosnian sevdalinka singers such as Zaim Imamoviƒá, Zehra Deoviƒá, Nada Mamula, Safet Isoviƒá and Meho Puziƒá. She was good friends with Isoviƒá and Puziƒá until their deaths in 2007.

The western terminus is at PA 35 in Tuscarora Township. The eastern terminus is at US 11/US 15 in Marysville. PA 850 is a two-lane undivided road that runs through rural areas in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. The route heads southeast from PA 35 and crosses PA 75 in Honey Grove before it traverses Tuscarora Mountain and leaves Juniata County for Perry County. PA 850 continues southeast and crosses PA 17 in Kistler before running east concurrent with PA 274 between Fort Robinson and Loysville. The route turns back to the southeast and heads south concurrent with PA 233 into Landisburg. PA 850 heads east, crossing PA 74 in Alinda before following PA 34 southeast between Dromgold and Shermans Dale. From here, the route continues east to its terminus in Marysville. PA 850 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 274 in Fort Robinson northwest to Kistler, with the road between Landisburg and Dromgold designated as part of PA 233. In 1937, the route was extended to its current length between PA 35 in Tuscarora Township and PA 14 (now US 11/US 15) in Marysville, replacing the portion of PA 233 between Landisburg and Dromgold. Route description PA 850 begins at an intersection with PA 35 in Tuscarora Township, Juniata County, heading southeast on a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through farm fields with some woodland before heading into more wooded areas and turning to the northeast. The road comes to McCullochs Mills and curves southeast again, heading through more woodland with a few farms and residences. PA 850 turns northeast and then southeast again, crossing the Tuscarora Creek. PA 850 comes to an intersection with PA 75 in the community of Honey Grove, where it briefly turns south to form a concurrency with that route and cross Laurel Run, before heading southeast into forested areas and crossing through a gap in Tuscarora Mountain, turning to the northeast. PA 850 crosses into Northeast Madison Township in Perry County and runs east through more forests with a few agricultural clearings and residences, passing through Walsingham. The road curves south and then northeast again as it traverses another portion of Tuscarora Mountain, passing through a tract of Tuscarora State Forest. The route turns south into open agricultural areas, heading more to the southeast as it comes to a junction with PA 17 in Kistler. PA 850 winds southeast through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, passing through Bixler. In Fort Robinson, the route comes to an intersection with PA 274. At this point, PA 274 forms a concurrency with PA 850 and the two routes head east on Shermans Valley Road, passing through a mix of farms and woods and crossing into Tyrone Township. The road heads through agricultural areas with some homes before coming into the community of Loysville, where PA 850 splits from PA 274 by heading to the southeast. The route heads south past homes prior to turning east out of Loysville and running through farmland with some woods and residences. The road turns to the south and comes to an intersection with PA 233. Here, PA 850 heads south along with PA 233 through more farmland along with some homes. The road crosses into Landisburg and becomes Carlisle Street, passing homes. In the center of town, PA 233 turns to the west and PA 850 turns east onto Main Street, running past more residences. The road heads back into Tyrone Township and becomes Landisburg Road, entering open agricultural areas. The route soon crosses into Spring Township and intersects PA 74 in Alinda. Here, PA 850 runs through more farmland with a few homes, turning southeast. The road heads into forested areas and turns northeast in Falling Spring, running a short distance to the north of the Sherman Creek. The route heads east and enters Carroll Township, coming to an intersection with PA 34 in Dromgold. At this point, PA 34 and PA 850 form a concurrency and continue southeast on Spring Road, passing farm fields and woods with homes as it runs east of the creek. The road crosses Sherman Creek and heads into business areas, with PA 850 splitting from PA 34 in Shermans Dale by heading east on Valley Road. The route runs through farmland and woodland with some homes in a valley, crossing into Rye Township. PA 850 continues through more rural valley areas, passing through Grier Point, crossing the Appalachian Trail, and running through Keystone. Residential developments near the road increase as it heads through Glenvale and turns to the east-northeast. PA 850 enters Marysville and becomes Valley Street, passing homes and coming to its eastern terminus at US 11/US 15. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 850 was not assigned a number. PA 850 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 274 in Fort Robinson northwest to Kistler along an unpaved road. The same year, the section of the current route between Landisburg and Dromgold was designated as the northernmost portion of PA 233, which was unpaved. By 1930, the section of the present route between Shermans Dale and Marysville was an unnumbered unpaved road, with a short paved section to the west of Marysville. In 1937, PA 850 was extended west from Kistler to PA 35 in Tuscarora Township and was extended east from Fort Robinson to PA 14 (now US 11/US 15) in Marysville. The route replaced the portion of PA 233 between Landisburg and Dromgold. The entire length of the route was paved in the 1930s.

Tahlee comes from the local Aboriginal word, Tarlee, meaning \\"sheltered from the wind and above water\\". European discovery Captain James Cook first sighted Port Stephens on 11 May 1777. He named it after Philip Stephens, then Secretary to the Admiralty. Charles Grimes, Surveyor General of the Colony, explored the area in 1795. It was concluded from his unfavourable report that it would never \\"be necessary to send a second time to it\\".Parry, William Edward, Sir.

Australian Agricultural Company In 1824, London was in the midst of an enormous stock market boom. With Australian wool becoming increasingly important, two companies - the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo.) and the Van Diemen's Land Company - were floated on the London Stock Exchange to promote raising fine-wooled sheep in the Australian colonies. The AACo. became a major force in the Australian coal and pastoral industries and in the settlement and development of the Hunter River and Port Stephens regions. Today, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, it is the oldest Australian company operating under its original name. Founded by a special Act of Parliament and under Royal Charter, it acquired the right to hold and sell land in New South Wales. Its founding members were a group of British bankers, merchants and politicians who saw the potential for big profits to be made in the colony. The terms of the charter were that most of the labour would be provided by convicts under the supervision of superintendents, overseers and skilled mechanics sent from England. If, at the end of 15 years, the company had expended 10,000 pounds on improvements and employed 1400 convicts, it would obtain freehold title to its land. The size of the land grant was not specified in the charter, but discussions between the company directors and the Colonial Office settled on one million acres. The company appointed a chief agent, Robert Dawson and a Colonial Committee to assist him. This eventually included just three people ‚Äì James Macarthur (fourth son of John Macarthur), his cousin Hannibal Macarthur and his brother-in-law, Principal Surgeon, James Bowman. The committee took a four-year lease of \\"The Retreat\\" (later 'Kelvin') at Bringelly near Camden for the immediate accommodation of imported stock, and sought advice on the best location for the land grant. In June 1825 Dawson sailed from the Isle of Wight with 27 employees and their wives and families, 800 French and Anglo merino sheep, 8 cattle and 6 horses. They were followed a few weeks later by an overseer, 6 shepherds and a further 79 French merinos. In January 1826, when people and stock were settled, Dawson sailed to Newcastle with a small party on the \\"Liverpool Packet\\" and from there, they travelled across country to inspect Port Stephens, an area which, of all those suggested, had the great advantage of access by water. On the northern shore of Port Stephens, Dawson noticed land which seemed ideal. About 800 acres were suitable for growing corn, while the surrounding hills provided good sheep grazing country, with plenty of fresh water and lime (oyster shells) for building, all situated on a magnificent harbour. Dawson hurried back to Sydney, determined to take the whole million-acre grant between Port Stephens and the Manning River (named for the AACo.'s deputy governor, William Manning). Initially known to Europeans by its Aboriginal name, Caribbean, the settlement at Port Stephens was renamed after the banking peer, Lord Carrington, brother of the company's first governor.Pemberton, 2009, 56-7 He was Britain's first Lord Carrington and had strong AACo. links. His grandson was later to become a Governor of New South Wales and Newcastle's Bullock Island was later renamed Carrington in his honour. One version of the name \\"Tahlee\\", a Gringal Aboriginal tribal name, was supposed to mean \\"sheltered from the wind\\". Dawson was much maligned. He gave the Barrington Tops and Barrington River their names. He also clashed with stormy wool pioneer John Macarthur.Scanlon, 2008 Dense bushland with sweeping water views was cleared and settled. In February 1826 Dawson arrived with cattle, sheep and convicts with the express purpose of growing fine wool for the mills of England and to secure a handsome profit for his bosses. The estate's main entry was by sea. It was the first major influx of private investment in Australia. Tahlee House became the original headquarters of the AACo. The house was eventually to become the home of four of the AACo.'s chief agents: Dawson, Parry, Dumaresq and King, whose names were commemorated in Newcastle inner-city street names. Within four years, by 1830, a new waterfront area of Carrington village, a few hundred metres away from Tahlee, boasted of being the first planned company town in Australia with a population of more than 500 souls and a school for 50 children. Convict-built boat harbour The original Carrington village initially had a 26-man military barracks made of brick, a row of 11 substantial cottages, a surgery, a permanent shearing shed, a butcher shop, offices, workshops, a brick kiln, a timber yard, a jail and two wharves. Over the next two years, Dawson explored the estate, naming many features after the company's directors or places of fine wool production in England. The village at No. 2 Farm took its name, Stroud, from the Gloucestershire town renowned for its manufacture of scarlet cloth; the Barrington River (and Barrington Tops) in honour of Dawson's previous employer, Lord Barrington. By the end of 1826 a chain of company sheep stations stretched from Carrington in the south to the Gloucester River in the north. Dawson had purchased flocks of colonial ewes and overseen the first shearing, dispatching the wool to England. He had also made arrangements to survey the entire land grant. Tahlee Estate was occupied by the AACo. in 1826 as their (first) headquarters. It was the first point of European settlement in the district, and there was extensive contact with the local Aboriginal people. The Commissioner's house was built on the site, and workers housing was built in the nearby village of Carrington. The workers included convict and free workers.Integrated Design Associates, 1999 The 172 acre estate had few owners and has been left largely intact. All appeared to be going well but difficulties gradually arose between Dawson and the Colonial Committee which led to Dawson's dismissal in April 1828. John Macarthur took over for a few months before abruptly returning to Sydney, leaving everything in the capable but inexperienced young accountant, Edward Ebsworth. Meanwhile, in London, the Colonial Office had approached the directors with a proposal that the company should take over the coal mining operations at Newcastle and, after lengthy discussions, the company agreed. John Henderson was appointed colliery manager and arrived in Australia in January 1827 with mechanics, labourers and equipment, 230 sheep and 3 horses. He spent nearly a year prospecting for coal around Newcastle, at Port Stephens and along the Parramatta River, concluding that without the Newcastle coalfield, the company had no mining prospects, but Governor Darling was loath to give it up. Dawson's dismissal, Henderson's return to England and rumours that the Port Stephens estate in its entirety was unsuitable for their purposes all came as a shock to the directors. As far as the coal venture was concerned, they were prepared to abandon the project provided the Colonial Office paid compensation. After much negotiation, however, it was agreed in June 1828 that the Governor would be instructed to hand over the coalfields, together with a land grant at Newcastle, and that Henderson would return to the colony as colliery manager. By way of compensation the company was granted a 32-year monopoly on coal mining in New South Wales. Sir William Edward Parry, the Arctic explorer and hydrographer, became the next commissioner of the AA Co in 1829 and arrived at Tahlee in March 1830. Parry set about restoring order at the neglected Port Stephens settlement and assessing the estate there and a possible exchange of land. The next two years were taken up with exploration to the north and west beyond the Dividing Range. In February 1831 Parry visited Governor Darling to negotiate the exchange of the north- eastern part of the Port Stephens estate (north from Bulahdelah) for two blocks of roughly 250,000 acres each - one on the Liverpool Plains (Warrah) and the other on the Peel River (Goonoo Goonoo).Parry, Edward. Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Sir WE Parry (London: Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans and Roberts; 1857) His five-year tenure was marked by progress and social reformation. Under his direction, Booral House, Stroud House and Telegherry House were constructed, along with a flour mill at Stroud and a dam on the Karuah River, now known as Washpool. He also personally oversaw the construction of a steamship named \\"The Karuah.\\" Parry was a devout Christian. When he discovered that the settlement lacked a church, he conducted his own Sunday service in the carpenter's shop at Carrington. In 1833 he constructed St John's church in Stroud and laid the cornerstone himself. Lady Parry opened a school and provided for the education of nearly 50 children. An adult school was also commissioned for the prisoners who wished to learn how to read and write. Parry also oversaw the formation of the colliery at Newcastle. Henderson had surveyed and rejected the government mines, so after putting down test boreholes on the hill and Government Reserve to the west of the town, Parry finally chose a site for the first pit that enabled the use of an inclined plane railway to take the coal skips to the company's wharf on the Hunter River. Work at the mine began on 14/1/1832. The promised land grant of 2000 acres was marked out - now covered by Newcastle's suburbs of Cook's Hill and Hamilton. Sir Edward Parry in May 1832 was plunged into grief due to the death of his beloved and revered mother, which he learned of through Sydney newspapers.Thomson, 1986, 28 Lady Parry had been a Miss Stanley, a member of the titled Stanley family of Alderley in Cheshire. The residence of the commissioner and his lady on the shores of Port Stephens became a social centre for the district, as well as an administrative centre for the A.A.Company. The house, \\"Tahlee\\", still evokes some of the charm, comfort and agreeable atmosphere it must have possessed when inhabited by Parrys. Sir Edward, a deeply religious man, was not only responsible to the London company directors, but also regarded the spiritual and physical well-being of almost 500 people on the company's estate as a solemn and personal responsibility. Surviving accounts depict Tahlee as a very happy place to live and work during the Parrys' residency. The convivial commissioner and his wife enjoyed their days here with cricket matches, dinners, balls and picnics, despite the limitations imposed by the isolation and smallness of the community. The Christian spirit that flourished at Port Stephens was in contrast to the grim restraint and bitter feelings which prevailed not very far away at Patrick's Plains, at \\"Castle Forbes\\", the property of \\"Major\\" Mudie. Mr Ebsworth, A.A. Company's accountant, wrote that on a fine summer evening, Lady Parry played the piano, with Sir Edward accompanying her on the violin, or reading aloud in the drawing room.Thomson, 1986, 28-29 When Parry left after his four-year term, both pastoral and mining operations were well established. Port Stephens was occupied by a chain of sheep stations and the cattle were settled on the Bowman run west of Gloucester. After a first lambing in 1832 Warrah was temporarily abandoned and the sheep moved to the Peel River where a head station was set up at Calala near the river crossing (now Tamworth). The mine at Newcastle was running smoothly. The only major and continuing difficulty was the battle to obtain sufficient convict labour. In March 1834 Captain Henry Dumaresq took over from Parry. For the most part the company prospered and in August 1834 the directors were able to announce their first dividend of ten shillings per share. A track was built over the Dividing Range from Gloucester to Tamworth so that in dry years sheep could be walked from the Peel Estate to Port Stephens for washing and shearing. The head station at the Peel was moved from Calala to Goonoo Goonoo, away from the ever-increasing numbers of often-scabby flocks travelling north to New England and the Darling Downs. By 1849 sheep numbers had reached 85,000. Warrah was developed for fattening cattle bred at Gloucester and horses were bred as remounts for the Indian army. The company no longer needed to purchase stock - rather its annual sales at Sydney and Maitland were an increasing success. At Newcastle a second pit had been put down and annual coal sales reached a value of 10,500 pounds a year. However, with the end of convict transportation, labour problems became acute, and constant requests were made to London for shepherds and coal miners. Dumaresq served until his death in 1838, when Mr James Ebsworth took over again as interim commissioner. Mr Ebsworth opposed a proposal by the company's English directors to subdivide the land into small parcels. Port Stephens would be a different place today if the plan had succeeded. Phillip Parker King Following Dumaresq's sudden death, directors appointed Captain Phillip Parker King (son of Governor Philip Gidley King) in his place. King came to office just as the depression, triggered in part by the collapse of the London wool market in 1836, began to bite. This was also a time of drought, followed by major floods. An attempt to introduce 100 young Irish labourers in 1840/1 to relieve the labour shortage ended badly. Only a third actually reached Port Stephens and all refused to shepherd, being unaccustomed to such work and terrified of being lost in the bush. Other smaller groups of shepherds, labourers and miners sent out from Britain were more successful. The company's agent took to meeting emigrant ships in Sydney and recruited several newly arrived families who settled in Port Stephens. By the end of the 1840s, of the 326 men employed in the company's pastoral operations, none were convicts and only 33 were ticket-of-leave men. By 1849 all 89 miners at the colliery were free men. During King's term as commissioner, there were constant agitations against the company's coal monopoly. Various prospecting groups proposed coal mines at Westernport in Victoria, the Illawarra in Sydney and at Moreton Bay. Closer to Newcastle were the Ebenezer mine at Lake Macquarie, works near Maitland, at Four Mile near Hexham and a proposal to mine coal at Burwood on the company's southern boundary. King appealed for support against this opposition, both to the NSW Government and to the directors who approached the Colonial Office. At this point the question of the monopoly became entangled with the company's efforts to obtain its title deeds. At no time had the numbers of convicts actually assigned to the company come anywhere near the numbers envisaged in the charter so that at best, it seemed that the company would be able to redeem only 300,000 of its one million acres. In London it was decided that, as the convict situation in NSW was now so different, an amending Act of Parliament was needed to free the company's pastoral lands from the restriction of the charter. The new Act received Royal assent on 7/8/1846. There now remained the question of the coal lands at Newcastle. Here it was agreed that, while the company had kept its side of the bargain, raising more than 3000 tons of coal annually, the NSW Government had not, neither supplying convict labour as agreed nor defending the company's position. Consequently, in return for an early end to its coal mining monopoly, the company received its freehold title at Newcastle. Anticipating a tide of emigration to NSW, the directors planned to sell part of the land. King recommended that the Liverpool Plains Grant should be sold in five sections, followed by the Peel Grant and the Port Stephens Grant, in three sections each. If the large blocks could not be sold, each section should be sold in lots by auction with the reserve price not more than that of the Government - five shillings an acre. Port Stephens, he added, was not generally suited for small-scale agriculture. This was a shock. The directors had not contemplated a complete sale of their land and stock, and they would be embarrassed to tell shareholders that, after 25 years, they were unlikely to recover their capital. In February 1849 King was called to London to discuss the matter. Meanwhile, the directors were negotiating with James Ralfe, formerly a government surveyor familiar with the Port Stephens area. Ralfe had recommended a private emigration scheme offering homestead lots for selection. A prospectus for \\"The Port Stephens Colony\\" appeared in January 1849: the land would be sold at the fixed price of one pound per acre in lots of not less than 200 (later reduced to 50) acres with reasonable water frontage and the right to depasture stock on company land. The company would charter a ship direct for Port Stephens with free passage for those who paid for their land in London. On arrival in London, King took a dim view of Ralfe's plan. Only a few isolated spots in Port Stephens were suitable for settlers and their activities would be ruinous for any continuing pastoral operations there. Despite King's objections, the directors were persuaded by Ralfe's enthusiasm, appointing him as agent and surveyor to go out with the settlers on the chartered \\"Artemesia\\". As it turned out, only 8 colonists signed up and embarked with their families and just 24 selection certificates were issued. Local auction sales of lots were more successful and half-acre town lots and a few farms were sold in south Tamworth, at Carrington and around Stroud. In these drastically changed circumstances, the directors decided to replace the commissioner with a less well-paid general superintendent, combine management positions and halve the number of overseers. Then in March 1852, Thomas Renwick and Thomas Laurie, sons of long- time company employees, and both just returned from the Californian gold fields, found gold on the banks of the Peel River. In London the company's share price soared from 15 pounds to 350 pounds in a few weeks before dropping back to 280. Unable to work gold under their charter, the directors formed the Peel River Land & Mineral Company to purchase and work the Peel Estate (Goonoo Goonoo). The Peel Company, with King as general superintendent, would raise sheep and some cattle, and lease its goldfield to the Cordillera Mining Company, which would dispatch miners and machinery from England. The venture was a disaster. The \\"Tory\\" carrying the expedition was wrecked at Anna Bay, south of Port Stephens. All but one of the people were saved, but the machinery was lost. Other attempts to work minerals were equally unsuccessful. The AACo. retained Port Stephens, Warrah and the coalmines at Newcastle. Although the fine wool produced at Port Stephens brought excellent prices on the London market, all was not well with the sheep. At Port Stephens mortality figures rose and lambing percentages fell, while sheep from the same flocks thrived on the Peel Estate. The Port Stephens district finally proved too wet underfoot for the early sheep flocks, and the AACo. acquired better land in the Peel Valley in 1854. Captain Phillip Parker King was the final AA Co commissioner to live in Tahlee House. The AACo. headquarters was moved to Stroud in 1853 and the Estate was sold to a Sydney stockbroker and investor, Robert Hoddley Driberg White (RHD White). In 1854 the directors decided to sell all the Port Stephens sheep, and by 1856 they were gone. Cattle breeding continued at Port Stephens and land sales were promoted around Stroud.Pemberton, 2009, 57-60 After the Australian Agricultural Company Frederick Manton, from Sydney, purchased the Tahlee property from the AA Co in 1854 for ‚Ç§2,500. His family used the property for grazing. However, the house burned down in 1860, leaving only the walls. The White era In 1880 the property was purchased by Robert Hoddle Driberg White, Member of Parliament for Gloucester (from 1882) and substantially developed as a gentleman's country residence. The present Tahlee House, dating from 1880, may be the fourth house on the site. The estate only revitalised from 1880 when R. H. D. White set about expanding his landholdings and creating a new gentleman's residence on Tahlee's old home ruins. White's father, James White, had been the AACo.'s stock master at Port Stephens. The colourful R. H. D. White, owner of two private steam yachts, became the member for Gloucester and rebuilt Tahlee House to hold lavish parties. Considerable development took place during this period. Improvements and extensions were added to Tahlee House. A billiard room and ballroom were constructed with marble for some of the fireplaces in these buildings imported from Italy. Twelve full-time gardeners were employed to maintain a number of terraced gardens. Guests arrived by yacht, landing below the home at a convict-built Cornish boat harbour. They were then taken by horse-drawn tram up the hillside through magnificent botanical gardens. There were summer houses and bird aviaries with 12 gardeners to look after the terraced gardens, luxuriant with towering New Zealand kauri trees (Agathis australis), Japanese elms (Zelkova serrata), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), African olives (Olea europaea var.africana) and bamboo thickets. White added a large lounge room to entertain the Sydney social set, plus in about 1890 built a separate billiard room (now a chapel) and ballroom capable of seating about 300 people. What is seen today is largely the legacy of White's ownership while the boat harbour, wine cellar and servants' quarters to the rear of the main house recall the AACo. tenure. On his death, the estate was held in trust for his widow and then passed to their son, Alfrey Beecher Stewart White, who lived primarily in Sydney. He used Tahlee House as a country retreat. The Gospel Fishermen In 1943 a group calling itself the Gospel Fishermen Mission moved across the Port Stephens waterway from Tanilba Bay to lease the Tahlee site. The Director, Godfrey Theobald, had developed a three pronged approach to mission. * Evangelists travelling in 'Gospel Vans' visited isolated districts. * Large meetings were held in churches in Newcastle and the Hunter Region. * Children's camps were held at Tanilba for the purpose of evangelism. In 1948, the staff of Gospel Fishermen visited Tahlee for a picnic. Over the next year, applications were forwarded to Mr White to rent the property to the mission. In 1949 the property was leased to the Gospel Fishermen Mission as a camp centre. In June 1949, the Theobold family moved into the Waterfront Cottage and began using the ballroom and billiard room at Tahlee. In 1951, the ministry established a missionary training camp under the supervision of Mr Frank Biggs. Mr White continued to visit Tahlee House. In 1959, he offered the property to the Mission, who accepted after a large donation made it possible for the purchase to take place. Tahlee Bible College Rev Eric Potter, a Methodist minister, was the first Principal of Tahlee Bible College and Godfrey Theobald held the position of the first College President. Lectures commenced on 10 June 1959, while the public opening held on 31 October 1959 attracted 400 people. More than 1,000 students have trained at the college and many of these are now in Christian service in Australia and in countries all over the world. Extensive renovations have been carried out on the property. Management has concentrated on running camps and events for children, young people and families. Tours of the historic buildings are regularly held. In 1964 several structures were relocated from the Greta and Singleton migrant camps to the site for use as residential accommodation. Now known as Tahlee Ministries Inc., visiting is possible by prior arrangement. The estate ceased operating as a bible college 2005, but remains in use by Tahlee Ministries for religious purposes.  Description  Thalee Boat Harbour Tahlee is a 44-hectare (108 acres) rural estate containing the former headquarters of the Australian Agricultural Company 1826‚Äì1853. Significant features include: * Tahlee House and outbuildings 1828‚Äì1888 (stone and timber, iron roof, stone cellar), * Boat Harbour 1828 (stone) * gardens 1830-1890, * caretakers cottage 1890 (timber) * Reception & Ballroom building 1888‚Äì90 (timber), * Residential Bible College 1959‚Äì99 (timber, brick ) * relocated Nissen Huts and Cinema from Greta Migrant Camp (timber and iron, reloc. 1964) The physical condition of the estate was reported to vary between good and poor as at 24 December 1999, with high archaeological potential.  Heritage listing  Tahlee Estate is of very high local, regional, state and national significance, contributing to our understanding of the history and development of Australia in every aspect of cultural significance including pre-European and European settlement. Evidence of past use of the Estate and the reasons for its significance remain sufficiently intact for the interpretation of the heritage of the Estate.Integrated Design Associates 1999 Tahlee was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Settlement site of the Australian Agricultural Company, a key export company in the early economy of NSW. Settlement of areas of Gloucester and Manning districts and Peel River was initiated from this site by its occupants Robert Dawson, Sir Edward Parry and Colonel Dumaresq. It is a significant area of pre-European human occupation. This is the site of an early positive encounter and treaty with local Aboriginal peoples. Documentation by occupants of the site including Robert Dawson and James Ebsworth of the Gringai people contributes to an understanding of a racial group that formerly inhabited the area. The Estate has association with a number of prominent people who have contributed to Australian and NSW history including John Macarthur, Sir Edward Parry, Colonel Dumaresq, Phillip King, RHD White. The Estate itself contributed to their role in history and reflects their past presence. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The aesthetic tastes of the occupants of the site are reflected in the orientation of the house and the gardens toward the views and the period design styles reflected in the buildings and gardens. Enjoyment of the site is reflected in the remains of recreational pursuits of boating, terraced gardens and bathing. The Estate has been the subject of a number of prominent artists and others including Augustus Earle and Conrad Martens. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Estate is valued by the State, regional and local community as the site of settlement of the AA Co. and the residence of a prominent local figure and politician RHD White. The Estate is also valued by the Protestant Christian communities of NSW, and the Newcastle region in its association with a number of Protestant figures in NSW history including Sir Edward and Lady Parry, Reverend Cowper, the King family, and the Gospel Fishermen Mission. This value is reflected in the continued use of the property as a Bible College.Integrated Design Associated 1999 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This is a significant site of European settlement from 1826 with sufficient ruins and documentation remaining to enable the pattern of settlement to be determined. The marine focus of the site including the boat harbour and observatory reflects a way of life which depended upon sea transport. Evidence of continued use of the site for 164 years enables former ways of life, the stages of settlement, early and late Victorian use of the site to be understood. The Observatory reflects the exploratory and scientific interests of Phillip King as well as reflecting the level of boating activity in the port in the 19th century. A high level of horticultural interest and technical excellence is reflected in the terraced gardens. The grazing land of Lot 340 reflects the former use of the shoreland of Port Stephens for extensive gazing, a use no longer prominent. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is a rare intact record of 164 years of European development - the gardens are very rare for their intactness and composition. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Estate is representative of the work of the A.A.Co. in NSW References * Bairstow, Damaris A Million Pounds, A Million acres Self- published 2003 * Stanbury, Betty Today's News Article (Tahlee Bible College 40) 1999 * Theobold, Carolyn R A Place Called Tahlee.

When Leopoldo Medici saw the work, he awarded a stipend for Francesco to study in Rome and Venice Francesco went to paint a lunette in the hall where his father had worked, painting Hector che arsa una nave greca e cosi adempiuto il decreto dei fati, viene da Aiace Talamonio costretto a indietreggiare. In Venice he made a copy of Titian's Assumption of the Virgin. He also made a sketch of the Hayez canvas depicting a scene from the end of The Count of Carmagnola by Manzoni and designed for the church of Santa Croce the canvas of Sant'Antonio resurrects the dead, finished by his younger brother Giuseppe. He died while painting Ajax the lesser tries to save himself from the storm, and spiteful of the gods, dies in his arms of his father Oileus.Ajax oileo che in onta ai numi tenta salvarsi dalla procella, manco tra le braccia paterna. Like his brother, he died of tuberculosis (pulmonary phtisis). He died at Milan.

It specialized in trendy clothing for teens, mainly targeting girls. Although the company's first 20 years saw the opening of only two more stores, it was largely profitable at its height in the mid-1980s and operated 288 stores in 22 western states by 1993. However, 1992 saw a major about face from success and many of the stores, especially in southern California, were becoming unprofitable and were closed. Although the cause of the turnaround is difficult to put a finger on, a recession, which proved troublesome for many retailers, could have been partially to blame. Some thought the company was expanding too quickly and its assets were spread too thin. Others argued that Jacobs had lost touch with the rapidly changing fashion trends and that he never gave his son-in-law enough control over the company. In an attempt to gain back lost business, the company tried to expand its target audience by going after young adults with career oriented clothing. This did not work, however, and with stores closing and rapidly falling sales, Jay Jacobs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May, 1994. Less than half the stores remain now. Founder Jay Jacobs resigned as chairman of the board in June, 1997 and left the board entirely the following November. They again filed for Chapter 11 on September 3, 1999 and announced the closure of the remaining 114 stores the same day. Jacobs, the namesake of the company, died Feb. 15, 2013.

The western terminus is at PA 516 in the Codorus Township community of Sticks. The eastern terminus is at PA 74 in Peach Bottom Township. PA 851 is a two-lane undivided road that runs through rural areas in southern York County a short distance to the north of the Maryland border. The route heads east from Sticks to New Freedom, where it turns north and intersects PA 616 in Railroad. PA 851 heads east through Shrewsbury and comes to an interchange with Interstate 83 (I-83). From here, the route heads east and passes through Stewartstown, where it forms a short concurrency with PA 24, and Fawn Grove, where it intersects PA 425, before continuing to its terminus. PA 851 has a truck route, PA 851 Truck, which bypasses the stretch between New Freedom and Shrewsbury. PA 851 was designated in 1928 to run from Woodbine north to PA 74 in Airville. In 1937, PA 851 was realigned to run from U.S. Route 111 (US 111) at Main Street in Shrewsbury east to PA 74 north of Delta, with the former alignment between Woodbine and Airville becoming an extension of PA 124 (now PA 425). The same year, the road between Sticks and New Freedom became an extended PA 516 while the road between New Freedom and Railroad became an extended PA 616. PA 516 was extended east to I-83/US 111 east of Shrewsbury in the 1950s, replacing PA 616 between New Freedom and Railroad and cutting the west end of PA 851 back to the interchange. PA 851 was extended west to PA 516 in Sticks in the 1960s, replacing the part of PA 516 between Sticks and I-83. A roundabout was constructed at PA 74 in 2008. Route description PA 851 entering New Park at Anderson Avenue PA 851 begins at an intersection with PA 516 just south of PA 216 in the community of Sticks in Codorus Township, York County, heading southeast on Steltz Road. The road winds southeast through farmland with some woods and homes, eventually bending to the south. The route turns east to remain along Steltz Road and runs a short distance to the north of the Maryland border, passing through the community of Steitz and crossing into Shrewsbury Township. PA 851 turns northeast away from the state line and continues through a mix of farm fields and woodland with occasional residences. The road curves east and then southeast before it makes a sharp turn to the northeast. The route becomes the border between Shrewsbury Township to the west and the borough of New Freedom to the east, passing between farmland to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east. PA 851 curves east to fully enter New Freedom and turns southeast onto West Main Street, passing a mix of homes and businesses. The route turns northeast onto North 2nd Street, with PA 851 Truck continuing east along West Main Street, and continues through residential areas. The road curves north into wooded areas and runs to the west of Old Mill Creek, the Steam into History tourist railroad, and the York County Heritage Rail Trail. PA 851 crosses into the borough of Railroad and becomes South Main Street, quickly turning west and then north as it runs through a mix of woods and residences. The route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 616, at which point it turns east onto East Main Street and crosses the South Branch Codorus Creek and both the Steam into History line and the York County Heritage Rail Trail. The road continues through wooded areas with some homes before leaving Railroad for Shrewsbury Township and turning northeast through farm fields. PA 851 enters the borough of Shrewsbury and becomes West Railroad Avenue, passing residences with some farmland to the south. The route turns north onto Park Avenue before heading east along West Forrest Avenue. PA 851 runs past homes and businesses in the center of Shrewsbury and crosses Main Street, where PA 851 Truck returns to the route. Past this intersection, the road becomes East Forrest Avenue and runs past more residences before gaining a center left-turn lane and heading through business areas along the border between Shrewsbury to the north and Shrewsbury Township to the south. The route fully enters Shrewsbury Township and comes to an interchange with I-83. Following this interchange, PA 851 runs past more commercial establishments before narrowing to two lanes and heading southeast, passing to the north of a park and ride lot. The route heads into farmland with some woods and homes parallel to Deer Creek to the northeast. The road curves east and crosses Deer Creek into Hopewell Township, continuing through rural areas with some development as Bridgeview Road. The route passes through the communities of Orwig, Reimold, and Zeigler before it runs through residential areas and heads into the borough of Stewartstown. Here, PA 851 becomes North Hill Street and heads southeast through industrial and commercial areas, crossing the Stewartstown Railroad. The route passes homes and some businesses, turning east onto West Pennsylvania Avenue and continuing to an intersection with PA 24 in the center of Stewartstown. At this point, PA 851 turns south for a concurrency with PA 24 on North Main Street for a block. PA 851 splits from PA 24 by heading east onto College Avenue, heading through residential areas. PA 851 westbound past PA 425 in Fawn Grove The route leaves Stewartstown for Hopewell Township again and becomes Pleasant Valley Road, running through agricultural areas with occasional trees and homes. PA 851 curves northeast before it turns southeast onto Woolen Mill Road and winds through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The road crosses the South Branch Muddy Creek into Fawn Township and continues through rural areas, curving east to pass through residential areas in the community of New Park. The route becomes West Main Street and runs through farmland with some trees and development before bending southeast and entering the borough of Fawn Grove. PA 851 runs between homes to the north and farm fields to the south before running past residences and businesses in the center of the borough, where it intersects the southern terminus of PA 425. At this point, the road becomes East Main Street and heads east past more homes before passing through a mix of residences and farmland. The route heads back into Fawn Township and becomes Graceton Road, heading southeast through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The road curves east and runs immediately to the north of the Maryland border. In the community of Constitution, PA 851 turns north away from the state line onto Bryansville Road, while Graceton Road continues along the state line as State Route 2080 before curving into Maryland and becoming Maryland Route 624. PA 851 heads through farmland with some woods and homes and bends northeast, crossing into Peach Bottom Township. The road continues through rural land and turns to the east at the Five Forks intersection with Miller Road, Hushon Road, and Aubel Road, passing to the south of the residential development of Susquehanna Trails. The route winds east through forests before running through farm fields with some homes and passing through the community of Bryansville. The road winds northeast through forests, turning southeast in the community of Bryansville Station. PA 851 continues through fields with some development before it comes to its eastern terminus at a roundabout with PA 74, where Broad Street continues southeast towards the borough of Delta. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 851 was not given a number. PA 851 was designated in 1928 to run from Woodbine as a related route to former PA 51 (now PA 16), north to PA 74 in Airville along an unpaved road. By this time, the road between New Park and Fawn Grove was an unnumbered, paved road while the road between Fawn Grove and Constitution was an unnumbered, unpaved road. By 1930, the road between Sticks and the Maryland border and New Freedom and Railroad were unnumbered, unpaved roads while the road between Railroad and Shrewsbury was an unnumbered, paved road. In 1937, PA 851 was rerouted to run from US 111 (Main Street) in Shrewsbury east to PA 74 north of Delta. The former alignment of the route between Woodbine and Airville became part of a southern extension of PA 124 to Fawn Grove; this road is now part of PA 425. In addition, the road between Sticks and New Freedom became an eastern extension of PA 516 while the road between New Freedom and Railroad became part of a southern extension of PA 616. The entire length of PA 851 was paved in the 1930s except for a portion to the west of New Park. In addition, PA 516 was a paved road between Sticks and New Freedom while PA 616 was a paved road between New Freedom and Railroad. The unpaved section of PA 851 to the west of New Park was paved in the 1940s. In the 1950s, PA 516 was extended east to an interchange with I-83/US 111 east of Shrewsbury, replacing the portion of PA 616 between New Freedom and Railroad along with PA 851 between Main Street in Shrewsbury and the interchange; the west end of PA 851 was relocated to the I-83/US 111 interchange. PA 851 was extended west to PA 516 in Sticks in 1961 in order to provide a numbered route at the interchange with I-83, replacing the portion of PA 516 between Sticks and I-83. In May 2008, construction of a roundabout at PA 74 was completed, replacing an X-shaped intersection which saw a high number of crashes. Major intersections PA 851 Truck Pennsylvania Route 851 Truck (PA 851 Truck) is a truck route of PA 851 between New Freedom and Shrewsbury. The truck route heads southeast from PA 851 in the center of the borough of New Freedom along two-lane undivided West Main Street. The road passes homes and businesses, becoming East Main Street at the Front Street intersection and crossing the Steam into History tourist railroad and the York County Heritage Rail Trail. PA 851 Truck continues through residential areas and turns northeast onto North Constitution Avenue. The road passes near industrial buildings before it leaves New Freedom for Shrewsbury Township and runs through a mix of fields and woods. The truck route enters the borough of Shrewsbury and becomes Constitution Avenue, curving east into business areas. PA 851 Truck turns north onto South Main Street and passes homes and a few businesses, crossing the abandoned Stewartstown Railroad. The road is lined with residences as it continues into the center of Shrewsbury. Here, PA 851 Truck reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 851. PA 851 Truck was designated in 1995.

The southern terminus is at PA 706 in Rush Township. The northern terminus is the New York state line in Little Meadows. The route from there continues as Tioga County Route 41. The route was assigned in 1928, completed a year later, and has remained the same since, with an exception of its southern terminus changing designations from Pennsylvania Route 67.  Route description  Route 858 at its southern terminus with Route 706 in Rush Township PA 858 begins at an intersection with PA 706 in the Rush Township community of Rushville. The highway begins its long trek in Susquehanna County by progressing northward in a patch of forests. PA 858, which runs west of a creek, is sparsely populated and homes are rare. PA 858 winds its way in and out of forests, heading on a northeast direction. Soon after, there is an intersection with Keefs Hill Road, a locally maintained highway. After Keefs Hill Road, PA 858 heads back into a dense patch of trees. In the forest, is an intersection with C. Warner Road, and soon after comes one for Shadduck Road. Although the dense forest ends, trees continue to surround the highway. The route turns a short drift off its alignment at an intersection with Miller Road. The route turns from the northward direction it was heading to a northwestern direction and intersects eventually with Guilton Road. The dense forestry returns, and Route 858 begins winding its way along. Residential homes have all but disappeared from the route, with trees showing the way into Middletown Center. PA 858 passes a pond to the east, intersecting with the former alignment of PA 859, now a locally maintained highway known as Vet Davis Road and Camp Corby Road. After leaving Middletown Center, PA 858 continues northward and sometimes northeastward. After Middletown Center, PA 858 is surrounded by nothing but trees. There is a break in the trees when PA 858 intersects with an unnamed road, which serves as a connector to Township Road 768\\\\. The state traffic route continues to the northwest, intersecting with Township Road 687\\\\. As PA 858 continues, it enters Apolacon Township, where the dense forestry begins to break, and homes begin to show the way. After a short pond is passed, the highway enters Little Meadows. At Maple Avenue, PA 858 runs on its final stretch, passing homes all the way to the New York state line. There, PA 858 ends and becomes County Route 41 upon entering Tioga County, New York. History Route 858 southbound at the state line in Little Meadows PA 858 was first assigned in the mass numbering of state traffic routes in Pennsylvania in 1928. However, the southern terminus of the highway was not an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 706. Instead, it was an intersection with PA 67. When it was assigned, it only ran from U.S. Route 106 to Town House Road, since the rest had not been completed yet. The final, already paved segment of SR 858 was completed by the next year. In 1932, the route south of Town House Road was paved. In 1972, PA 67 was decommissioned, and the route at the southern terminus became PA 706.

The foundation supports scientists and researchers in their efforts to determine the definitive causes of triple-negative breast cancer so that effective detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment can be pursued and achieved. Since its inception in 2006, TNBC has raised over $2 million to further this mission.  History  TNBC Foundation was founded in 2006 in honor of Nancy Block-Zenna, who, at age 35, was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. In response to her diagnosis, her close friends launched the TNBC Foundation to raise awareness and support research for this particular type of breast cancer. Block-Zenna died of the disease in 2007, 2 years after her diagnosis.  Symposium  On December 11, 2007, the TNBC Foundation and Susan G. Komen for the Cure convened one of the first \\"think tanks\\" dedicated specifically to triple-negative breast cancer. The meeting was held prior to the opening of the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Thirty researchers, from leading cancer institutions in North America and Europe, were invited to share information on the latest science, to discuss potential research collaborations and develop a scientific agenda for future research and clinical trials to find effective treatment for women with this subtype of breast cancer. The meeting also marked the first joint effort between TNBC and Susan G. Komen for the Cure to share resources to accelerate research and progress for women who are not benefiting from recent advances in breast cancer research. The goal of the meeting was to create the first comprehensive publication and white-paper summarizing the \\"state of the science\\" with input and authorship from leading researchers from around the world who have been dedicated specifically to this subtype of the disease. The publication will also include a roadmap and recommendations for planning, funding and designing the next level of research with the goal of identifying effective, tailored therapies for these women, thereby further reducing the rates of breast cancer mortality around the world.Susan G. Komen for the Cure Co-chairing the symposium were Allison Axenrod, executive director of TNBC, and Hayley Dinerman, TNBC's director of operations. The program was planned by TNBC's medical advisory board, which includes Dr. Winer as well as Lisa A. Carey, M.D., medical director of the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and George W. Sledge, Jr., MD, professor of Medicine and Pathology and co-chair of the Breast Cancer Program at the Indiana University School of Medicine.Researchers From Around the World Gather to Discuss Triple Negative Breast Cancer Reuters Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation TNBC has convened the Symposium each year since 2007. In 2010, over 30 researchers and scientists attended the Symposium, which was again co-sponsored by Susan G. Komen for the Cure and The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). That year, the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation awarded its first independent grants to two researchers who were doing research in the area of triple-negative breast cancer. Grant initiatives In 2008, the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation co-funded a research grant with the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation. TNBCF's initial $500,000 contribution marks the first time a nonprofit partner has co- funded one of Komen's \\"Promise Grants\\". Worth $7.5 million over five years, Promise Grants are designed to bring clinical researchers and basic scientists together to deliver new treatments for patients as quickly as possible. The Promise Grant was awarded to Dr. Andreas Forero of the University of Alabama, Birmingham Comprehensive cancer Center. Forero and his team are researching a new targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.

William Floyd House is a historic house on Main Street at Gifford Hill Road in Westernville, New York. Built in 1803, it was the last home of William Floyd (1734‚Äì1821), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a driving force in the settlement of the area. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. The house is a private residence, and is not normally open to the public. Description and history The Gen. William Floyd House is located in the village center of Westernville, on the west side of Main Street at its junction with Gifford Hill Road. The house's main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented facing roughly southwest, with a two-story ell extending to the west. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance. The interior follows a center hall plan, with the main staircase on the left side of the central, a pair of parlors to the right, and the dining room and study to the left. Preserved period elements include wide floor boards and paneled fireplace walls. The house was built in 1803 by William Floyd, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Floyd, a native of Mastic, New York, served in the New York militia during the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of major general. For his service, he was awarded over in Upstate New York in 1787. He began developing the grant soon afterward, and moved to what is now Westernville in 1803, when this house was finished. The house remained in the hands of his descendants until 1956. Floyd's home in Mastic, New York, still stands, and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The two William Floyd houses are believed to be the only surviving homes in New York of signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Stravaganza's fourth season from 1995 to 1996 on the Fox Kids block. It was created by David Silverman and Savage Steve Holland. The segment was animated by the same people who used to work for Fox's The Critic, which was canceled that year. The executive producers were David Silverman, Savage Steve Holland, and Phil Roman. Unlike the Eek and Thunderlizard segments, this was a Fox Children's Productions and Savage Studios co-production in association with Film Roman for animation. Six episodes were produced. The segment follows Ryan and Wade Heap, who cannot have a pet because their father is allergic to pets. So they decide to make a pet on their own, out of a pile of junk (Klutter) by static electricity. There are other characters in the show, like Sandee Heap, who was lonely at first, before Klutter came into their lives. They went on mysteries, a la Scooby-Doo, to save animals and solve crimes. Characters Klutter Klutter is the eponymous star of the show. He is a pet made from a pile of clothes from static electricity by Ryan and Wade Heap. Klutter is thought as a dog in the show, mostly because of licking other people faces (mostly Vanna), and alerting the gang what is going on. Of course, Klutter is sometimes ignored by Ryan, Wade and the gang while alerting or saving somebody, or squashed by objects and other things. Klutter's owner's parents does not know that he exist. He was voiced by Kirk Thatcher. Ryan Heap Ryan Heap is the oldest of the Heap children. He wants to be a reporter just like his father. But his father laughs at him because he thinks the stuff are not real. He was the leader of the gang. His hairdo would change different colors in almost every episode. He was voiced by Cam Clarke. Wade Heap Wade Heap is the middle child with a mild attitude. He does not say much, but that is because he is quiet most of the time. He has a distinctive low/Geeky voice. He was voiced by Savage Steve Holland, the co-creator. Kopp Kopp is a character that is very crazy and paranoid sometimes lazy. He is an underachiever, who has a not so secret crush on Vanna. It is known that Kopp was based on the real Bill Kopp, who could not participate to work on Klutter. He was voiced by Michael Zorek. Sandee Heap Sandee Heap is the youngest of the Heaps. She is a preschooler that was previously lonely until Klutter came around and brighten up her day. She is often noted for her extremely high voice. She was voiced by Sandy Fox, whose name is just like Sandee's name. Vanna Erving Vanna Erving is Ryan, Wade, and Sandee's neighbor that lives next door. She is a teacher's pet, bright, and sometimes mean and bossy. She cannot stand either Klutter or Kopp for their silly actions sometimes. She is sometimes a brat when she feels like acting one. She was voiced by Halle Stanford. John Heap John Heap is the father of Ryan, Wade and Sandee Heap. He is a news reporter that most of the time claims that the town he lives in is dull, although exciting (and scary) things happens when he does not look. His voice was provided by the co-creator, David Silverman. Andrea Heap Andrea Heap is the mother of Ryan, Wade and Sandee Heap. She wants Ryan and Wade to focus on growing up (and picking up their Klutter off the floor). She is also a 1960s like mom who is a little ditsy. She is also a library employee. She was voiced by Kathy Ireland. Cast *Kirk Thatcher .... Klutter *Cam Clarke .... Ryan Heap *Savage Steve Holland .... Wade Heap *Sandy Fox .... Sandee Heap *Michael Zorek ....

It was the home of Rufus King who was a signer of the United States Constitution, a New York State Senator, and an Ambassador to Great Britain immediately after the American Revolution.Rufus Biography It is located at 150th Street and Jamaica Avenue. Descendants of King's family lived in the house until 1896 when Rufus' granddaughter Cornelia King died and the house was sold to the Village of Jamaica. When Jamaica, along with the western half of Queens County was annexed by New York City in 1898, the house and the property were turned over to the New York City Parks Department which re- designated the land as \\"Rufus King Park.\\" It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. History The original section of King Manor is believed to date to about 1700 and served as an inn and a farmhouse. Before the King family moved in the Manor also functioned as the parsonage for two ministers of Grace Episcopal Church. Margurite Doggett, Robert W. Rupp. \\"A Brief History of King Manor\\" Reverend Thomas Poyer lived in the house from 1710-1732 and when he died Reverend Thomas Colgan purchased it from his widow. Colgan would live in the house from 1732- 1755. While Reverend Poyer owned the house Reverend Horatio O‚Äô Ladd described the house as having eight rooms on one floor and two good rooms upstairs. The house would pass to his son-in-law Christopher Smith in 1776 following Mrs. Colgan‚Äôs death on April 17, 1776. Rufus King then purchased the house from Christopher Smith on November 20, 1805; King also purchased farm and woodland, averaging a total of 90 acres for $12,000.Biography/Timeline. Anonymous. Rufus King. 1755-1827 Ever since King acquired this home, he enlarged the rooms and added to the house to be suitable for entertaining notables of that time as a country house. King made several other renovations to the house including adding on to the eastern part of the house the oval ended dining room that still exists today. He also moved the original cottage behind this section to create the kitchen. King lived in this manor until 1825, when he was stricken with an illness; this forced him to return to Manhattan to be cared for by his youngest son, Frederick, who was a physician. King died in 1827 and was buried beside his wife in Grace Churchyard, Jamaica. This manor was inherited by King's eldest son, John Alsop King, in 1827. Cornelia King, the youngest daughter of John A. King, was the last King family member to live in King Manor. Preservation In 1897, the house and ground were bought by the Village of Jamaica to be used as a park, and later a city park.Rufus King House, Jamaica, NY Park entrance The King Manor Association was formed in 1900 with the purpose of caring for the house and the museum collection. The Association still exists and runs King Manor to this day. There are several instances in its history where King Manor as a museum was threatened. The first came in the 1920 when there was talk of turning the house into a branch of the Queens Public Library. Panchyk, Richard, ‚ÄúHidden History of Queens‚Äù, The History Press, Charleston, SC, 2018 Public outcry was so great however, that the plan was abandoned. Then only ten years later there were plans to build a civic center or courthouse on the property directly behind the house in what is today Rufus King Park. Again, there was a lot of push back from the community and a prominent local attorney sent a letter to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia voicing these sentiments. Ultimately, it was Jamaica‚Äôs lack of parking that saved the park and house. An Open House was held at King Manor in March 1948 as part of the citywide celebration of the city's 50th anniversary.Article. Anonymous. \\"Historic King Manor to Hold Open House in Golden Jubilee.\\" 9 MAY. 1948 On Monday and Wednesday during that time, classes from Queens schools and adult leaders were welcomed. Adults were invited on Tuesday and Thursday, and both children and adults were admitted on Saturday. All efforts and tasks to furnish these rooms were done by the Long Island Society of the Daughters of the Revolution, the Colonial Daughters, the Jamaica Village Society and others. According to an article, the house was supposedly \\"on the way to the century mark.\\"Article. Ames, Charlotte. \\"King Manor Was the Home Of Colonial Statesman.\\" Long Island Daily Press, 3 AUG. 1957. It is not completely known whether the \\"manor house\\" looked the same as it was in 1805 in today's era. Today, the house is picturesque and stands in the center of a square block of King Park on Jamaica Avenue. Only a few people know or care that the King Manor is a \\"treasure-trove of 18th century lore\\" and contains furniture, furnishings, books, and pictures that date back to the 18th century. The park and the house are kept painted and repaired by the City of New York. The King Manor Association, formed in 1900, strove to \\"foster patriotism and good citizenship\\" by caring for the manor and collecting historical items there. During its history as a museum King Manor suffered two fires. The first was in March 1964. While the building was saved there was severe structural damage done and many antiques were lost. Two rooms were gutted by the fire with smoke and water damage throughout the house. The damage from this fire was well documented by the Long Island Daily Press. ‚ÄúLong Island Daily Press Photograph Morgue Collection at Queens Public Library‚Äù, ‚ÄúLong Island Daily Press‚Äù The second fire was minor in comparison and was set on the porch by a group of teenagers.

After being wounded in battle she was captured, tortured, and executed by German soldiers in Smalyavichy. She was posthumously awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 March 1945. Early life Born in the city of Glazov in the Udmurt ASSR, she was the fifth of six children born to a working family. After graduating from secondary school in 1934 Baramzina graduated from the Glazov State Pedagogical Institute and spent two years teaching a kindergarten class in a village school at Kachkashur. On 2 November 1937 she applied to join the Komsomol and was accepted one month later. In 1940, she enrolled at University in Perm, and when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, she began to attend nursing courses in the evening, while training to become a sharpshooter. World War II In June 1943 she was sent to the Central Women‚Äôs Sniper Training School outside Moscow and, upon graduation in April 1944, she was sent to the 3rd Belorussian Front. Within her first three months, she had killed at least 16 enemy soldiers, while serving in the 3rd Battalion of the 252nd Rifle Regiment (70th Rifle Division, 33rd Army). In the beginning of the war she served as a sniper but due to suffering problems with her vision she was retrained to work as a telephone operator; she repaired fourteen telephone connection lines under heavy artillery fire in the battle of Maloye Morozovo in June 1944. On July 5, 1944 Baramzina's battalion parachuted behind enemy lines as part of a larger attempt to seize the crossroads near the village of Pekalin in Smalyavichy, hoping to block the retreat of German forces. An engagement broke out before they reached the crossroads, and the battalion took heavy casualties due to being heavily outnumbered. After killing 20 German soldiers, Baramzina was reassigned to care for the wounded personnel due to her medical training. The trench that was being used to hold the Soviet wounded was re-taken by German forces, and Baramzina evacuated as many injured Soviet soldiers as she could to the forest before the trenches were taken over. German soldiers raided the dugouts holding injured soldiers, shooting the wounded with high-powered anti-tank rifles (Panzerb√ºchse). After being wounded by artillery fire in the chaos, she was captured and subjected to torture in an attempt to have her divulge information on the number of troops and what regiment she was from. After her eyes had been gouged out, Baramzina was subsequently shot point-blank with an anti-tank rifle. Her body was mutilated to the point that only pieces of her hair and uniform could be used for identification, and what remained of her was buried in the Volma mass grave in until the remains were transferred in 1963 to Kalita. Commemoration In addition to a monument in the local Glazov park, Proletarskaya Street, on which she had grown up, was renamed in her honour, as well as streets in Minsk and Izhevsk and outside the Podolsk Central Women's Sniper Training School.–ü–æ–¥–æ–ª—å—á–∞–Ω–µ –ì–µ—Ä–æ–∏ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞ The Young Pioneers group at the school in which she had been teaching was also renamed in her memory.

The site preserves the 1787 home of statesman John Jay (1745-1829), one of the three authors of The Federalist Papers and the first Chief Justice of the United States. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1981 for its association with Jay. The house is open year-round for tours. Description and history The John Jay Homestead is located in a rural setting east of the village of Katonah, on the north side of Jay Street (New York State Route 22). It is a 2-1/2 story gambrel-roofed brick building, with single-story gable-roofed wings to either side. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the centered entrance. The center bay is slightly wider than the others, and the entrance is topped by a four-light transom window. A shed-roof porch shelters the entire span of the first floor, wrapping around in open sections to secondary entrances in the side wings. The home was constructed in two major phases, on of land that was part of a larger parcel that his maternal grandfather Jacobus Van Cortlandt purchased from Chief Katonah around 1700.Magnet, Myron. The Founders at Home: The Building of America, 1735-1817. W. W. Norton, 2013, page 261. John Jay made arrangements in February 1787 with brickmakers and carpenters for the first phase of construction, which was completed in 1790. The second phase, executed in 1800-01, included the addition of the wings (one replacing the first kitchen wing), and the extension of the main block to five bays. Jay, whose long and illustrious career included the Continental Congress, drafting of New York's first state constitution, Governor of New York, and Chief Justice of both New York's Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court, spent his retirement years on this property. The house remained in the Jay family until 1959, when it was given to Westchester County, which turned it over to the state. The state undertook the reversal of some alterations made after Jay's ownership, and opened it as a historic site. In 1977, the non-profit Friends of John Jay Homestead was founded to increase public awareness of the site. It raises funds and provides volunteer assistance for the Homestead's preservation, restoration and interpretation. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1981. and File:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait, 1794) File:JohnJayHomestead HABS cropped.jpg|South perspective view in 1961 (HABS) Legacy In 2004, the landmark, known as Bedford House, was added to the African American Heritage Trail of Westchester County, a group of 13 sites which include the Rye African-American Cemetery, Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site and the Jay Estate in Rye.

MX-8 stands for \\"Military Experimental 8\\", following from a list of prototype vehicles developed by Steelcraft during the latter half of the 20th century. The Philippine Army has expressed significant interest in the project, helping to bankroll a few aspects of the prototypes, indicating intent to purchase a number units once the MX-8 has exited the development stage. Development The first prototype of the MX-8 was manufactured by Steelcraft in 2005 under the Philippine's Self Reliant Defense Posture Law. Steelcraft also manufactured the first Philippine-made armored personnel carrier, the Hari-Digma (Filipino, \\"King of Battle\\") and also its variant, the MX-1 Kalakian. The MX-8 is to fulfill a role that the larger Cadillac Gage Commandos and LAV-300s in service with the Armed Forces of the Philippines could not, and that was to provide small, armored and armed escorts through rebel-infested jungles. Though not officially used by Steelcraft, or the Army, Barako (\\"Wild boar\\") is the nickname given to the vehicle by members of the Philippines Defense Forces' Forum. Designed to be low-cost, yet effectively durable for the price - protection is equivalent to that of a Simba - a single unit costs roughly Php 6.8 million, around US$150,000. Currently, the MX-8 is in its second prototype form after the first went through testing at the Light Armored Division's Research and Development Command with significant changes done to the frame and power train after the RDC's testing and evaluation found several potential problems arising from the prototype's design. The second prototype gets rid of these problems, and is currently awaiting to be transferred to the RDC for further testing and evaluation. Engine Taking into consideration low cost, yet making the MX-8 as reliable as possible, the designers incorporated an off- the-shelf engine and drivetrain from a Mitsubishi medium-duty truck, a 4-cylinder, 4.3 liter, turbocharged, intercooler engine giving the MX-8 150 horsepower. Running on a 5-speed manual transmission, the MX-8 gets a 35.9:1 power-to-weight ratio that is transmitted to a live-axle, semi-elliptical rear and double wishbone, coil suspension up front for its four-wheel drive platform. The MX-8 gets 100‚Äì120 km/h on paved roads, presumably less on unpaved roads, though statistics are not quite clear on this issue. Armor The MX-8's monocoque hull is made from quarter-inch rolled steel plating and is resistant to 7.62 mm armor-piercing rounds from the front, rear and sides at point-blank range. Glancing shots from .50-caliber rounds will be deflected by the armor but will penetrate if shot head-on unto an armor panel. Building a monocoque body around the drive train and engine ensures maximum body rigidity and eases manufacturing constraints while allowing the incorporation of a semi-V shaped hull and blow-away wheel wells as measures against anti-vehicle mines and IEDs. A 1-meter fully enclosed turret is situated on the top of the vehicle, allowing a variety of weapons configurations such as a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher or .50 cal heavy machine gun for fire-support roles. This enclosed turret may be replaced with an open turret ring mounting a simple heavy or general purpose machine gun and gunner shield. Armament Armament is limited by the vehicle's carrying capacity, similar to smaller armored vehicle standards, as well as what can dimensionally fit in the one-meter armored turret. The following may be the primary weapons outfitted on the MX-8: * 7.62 mm machine gun * 40 mm automatic grenade launcher * M2 .50 heavy machine gun * Remote controlled turret The Philippine Army has been experimenting with a number of Humvees mounting an M134 Vulcan Minigun in place of the ring-mounted machine gun, and this kind of set-up has a good chance of being put in use on the MX-8. Variants Proposed variants rumored to be in the pipeline as soon as production officially starts, though nothing final has come from Steelcraft, include: Armored personnel carrier and Amphibious assault vehicle.

Zak Hern√°ndez, and the serious wounding of another, Sgt. Ronald T. Marshall. In addition to serving as a deputy in the National Assembly, where he represented the province of Veraguas for the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), he served as President of the unicameral National Assembly from September 1, 2007, elected by a vote of 50-26 (defeating his rival Wigberto Quintero of the Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement), until August 31, 2008. Early life Pedro Miguel Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was born on January 1, 1965 to Gerardo Gonz√°lez Vernaza (1929-2006), a Panamanian politician who served as President of the National Assembly from 1997 to 1999, as well as acting as the head of the PRD party.See biography at PRD web site.  Alleged involvement in Hernandez murder  On June 10, 1992, United States Army Sgt. Zak Hern√°ndez-LaPorte and Sgt. Ronald T. Marshall were ambushed while driving in their Humvee at an entrance to Albrook Air Base on the outskirts of Panama City. A group of gunmen fired at the pair with an AK-47 from a civilian car before making their escape. Marshall was seriously injured, while Hern√°ndez died from his wounds. The murder occurred two-and-a- half years after the US invasion of Panama to depose military ruler Manuel Noriega, and just prior to a visit by US President George H.W. Bush. Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was immediately the prime suspect, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. According to a lawyer for the US Embassy, three witnesses stated he was present at the scene, while others saw him and two accomplices in the stolen car used in the shooting. The car was later found on a farm owned by his father. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation matched an AK-47 from the attacks was found on the farm as well, while Scotland Yard and the Panamanian police did not find the AK-47 to match the bullets from the shootings.  Legal proceedings  Though an arrest warrant was issued for Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n shortly after the murder, he evaded arrest for more than two years, reportedly spending part of this time in Cuba. In 1995, he surrendered directly to new President Ernesto Perez Balladares on live national television, accompanied by his father. Gonz√°lez's father stated that the unusual circumstances were needed \\"to avoid an attempt on the kid's life\\". He accused the previous Guillermo Endara administration of \\"judicial terrorism\\" and stated that under the Perez Balladares administration, his son could receive a fair trial. Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was held for the following two years in an air-conditioned jail cell with a computer and cell phone, during which his trial was repeatedly delayed. Jaime Abad Espinosa, the Panamanian police official who had led the investigation into the murder, was forced to resign, and was accused by Gonz√°lez's father of suppressing ballistics evidence proving Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n's innocence. Abad was later arrested and tried on the charge. Panamanian human rights groups protested on Abad's behalf, with the Panamanian Center for the Investigation of Human Rights and Judicial Assistance stating that the \\"unaccustomed dispatch\\" with which Abad's case was handled indicated that its \\"clear purpose is that its result influence the result of the other case\\". Abad was found guilty of removing evidence and fined, but was pardoned on June 28, 1998 by Perez Balladares. In late 1997, Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was brought to trial and acquitted. The US State Department objected to the verdict, calling it \\"inconsistent with persuasive testimony by credible and disinterested witnesses as well as firearm and other physical evidence\\". The Washington Post described the verdict as an \\"outrage\\" that showed that US soldiers must leave the country following the handover of the Panama Canal. Gonz√°lez Pinz√≥n was also indicted by a US grand jury for his alleged role in the killing shortly after it took place. He remained wanted by the US as of 2007. Presidency of National Assembly After being elected twice to the National Assembly of Panama as a PRD candidate, Gonz√°lez was selected by his party on September 1, 2007 to serve as the body's President. His assumption of the presidency was protested by the US, which described him as a fugitive. The move came during the negotiation of the Panama‚ÄìUnited States Trade Promotion Agreement, and several members of the US Congress stated that they would oppose ratification of the pact until Gonz√°lez was removed from office. Gonzalez called his election in the face of US opposition a demonstration of Panamanian independence, stating, \\"The era in which the U.S. had the last word in determining who governed our nation and how they did so is over.\\" Gonz√°lez's appointment caused controversy within Panama, particularly due to its threatening of the free trade pact. In one poll, most Panamanians stated that Gonz√°lez should step down. However, Gonz√°lez's backers stated that the US opposition to his leadership was another chapter in a long history of US interference in Panamanian affairs, and rejected it as inappropriate. Former Panamanian President Guillermo Endara stated that he believed Gonz√°lez to be guilty of the murder, though he opposed the trade agreement. President Mart√≠n Torrijos, a fellow PRD member who had negotiated the trade pact, made a private request for Gonz√°lez to resign, but avoided publicly criticizing him. In December 2007, the National Assembly declared December 20 to be an official day of mourning for those Panamanians killed during the 1989 invasion by the United States. Gonz√°lez supported the action, stating that \\"All political sectors have wanted to cast a blanket of forgetfulness ... Maybe out of shame or for other reasons, but it isn't fair to all of those Panamanians that still lie in common graves.\\" In January 2008, after ceremonies in Panama marking Martyr's Day (remembering students killed in a 1964 clash with U.S. soldiers over the Panama Canal), the web site of the Panamanian legislature was hacked to display an image of the US flag; the website was then down for three weeks. The Guardian described the hackers as apparently angry about Gonz√°lez's election. On March 7, 2008, it was announced that Gonz√°lez would not seek reelection as head of the National Assembly when his term ended on August 31. After a long delay, US President Barack Obama resubmitted the trade pact to the US Congress, which approved it on October 13, 2011.

The site of Burnley College began as the Richmond Survey Paddock in 1850. The Horticultural Society of Victoria took control in 1863 and opened the gardens on 1 January 1863, the official opening being marked by the planting of a Californian Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) which is now a magnificent tree. The site was transferred to the Victorian Department of Agriculture in 1891 and the gardens became home to the new teaching college. In subsequent years, the college has taught not only production and ornamental horticulture but many areas of agriculture: Burnley has been home to a dairy herd, poultry trials and beehives. In 1983, The College was amalgamated with the Department of Agriculture's other colleges, including Dookie College, to form the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture (VCAH). As a result of the 1988 white paper on Higher Education, the VCAH was amalgamated with the University of Melbourne, formally legislated under the University of Melbourne (VCAH) act 1997. The act granted all (formerly state owned) property and assets of the VCAH to the University of Melbourne, and also transferred all obligations of the VCAH to the University. In the mid 1990s, there were over 2000 students enrolled at the College. In 1994, 224 students graduated, 75 of whom were from the longest running course, the Advanced Diploma in Horticulture. At the time the University took control, courses ranged from introductory short courses in horticulture, through Apprentice training, TAFE courses, the Advanced Diploma, and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Horticulture. There was also a Graduate Certificate and postgraduate research at Masters and PhD levels. There were 35 academic staff, and approximately 40 technical, administration and ancillary staff. The University phased out the TAFE courses, in line with the \\"Melbourne Model\\". Current courses run at the campus include; Doctor of Philosophy (by research), Master of Philosophy (by research), the Master of Urban Horticulture (course work), the Graduate Certificate in Arboriculture, the Graduate Certificate in Garden Design, the Specialist Certificate in Green Roofs and Walls and the Associate Degree in Urban Horticulture. Burnley College is now much more focused on postgraduate research than in the past, specializing in areas such as green infrastructure, forest science, waterways ecology and management, environmental horticulture and has a significant soil science research group on campus. Facilities include a specialist library, plant nursery, field research and demonstration area, graphics studio, horticultural engineering facilities and plant tissue culture and genetics laboratories. Today, 150 years after the Burnley Gardens were established, they continue to be a wonderful resource for students and visitors alike. The open lawns, curved paths, secluded areas and large conifers providing architectural form combine to make a classic Victorian Garden. Recent developments such as the Native Grasslands Garden and the Rainforest Garden have provided new design themes for the gardens. The importance of the Burnley Gardens to the State of Victoria was recognised when the gardens were added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 5 December 2003.

Christmas tree production occurs worldwide on Christmas tree farms, in artificial tree factories and from native strands of pine and fir trees. Christmas trees, pine and fir trees purposely grown for use as a Christmas tree, are grown on plantations in many western nations, including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Australia, the industry is relatively new, and nations such as the United States, Germany and Canada are among world leaders in annual production. Great Britain consumes about 8 million trees annually, while in the United States between 35 and 40 million trees are sold during the Christmas season. Artificial Christmas trees are mostly produced in the Pearl River delta area of China. Christmas tree prices were described using a Hotelling-Faustmann model in 2001, the study showed that Christmas tree prices declined with age and demonstrated why more farmers do not price their trees by the foot. In 1993, economists made the first known demand elasticity estimates for the natural Christmas tree market. Natural tree production Australia Christmas tree farming is a relatively new agricultural pursuit in Australia with the industry only sprouting up within the early 21st century. There are a number of differences in Christmas tree production in Australia when compared with nations in the Northern Hemisphere. The growing season differs because harvest is during a different time of year, this means that lessons learned about farming in the United States and Europe are more difficult to apply to Australia. The seasonal difference also affects the pruning and shearing schedule for the crop. The other primary difference in Australian Christmas tree farming is found in the type of tree grown, Pinus radiata, which is no longer commonly grown for Christmas trees in the United States and Europe, is popular in Australia.Sonogan, Bruce. \\"Growing cut Christmas trees, (PDF), Agriculture Notes, Victoria Department of Primary Industries, January 2006, ISSN 1329-8062.

Market European British demand for natural Christmas trees is around 8 million annually, with about two-thirds of households opting for artificial trees. When a Danish tree shortage in 2006 resulted in only 200,000 of the usual 1 million Nordmann Fir trees to the British Isles, British farmers were forced to make up the deficit with Norway Spruce, Fraser Fir, and Scots pine. The shortage was a result of a hot summer and a cut in subsidies for growing Christmas trees in Denmark. Christmas tree consumers in Europe prefer trees with less density and a more open, layered appearance. This is partially because trees are displayed for a relatively short period of time in Europe, and many are lit with candles.Chastagner, Gary A., and Benson, D. Michael.

Modern U.S. Christmas tree consumers want higher density trees, and begin purchasing trees shortly after Thanksgiving. This requires trees to last longer and be harvested earlier. Much of Mexico's demand for Christmas trees (around 1.8 million annually) is met through importation. In 2004 the United States enjoyed a 95 percent market share on tree imports.

Profitability An entomologist checks Scotch pine for pine shoot beetles at a Christmas tree farm near East Lansing, Michigan. One appeal of Christmas tree farms to growers is that it can be a profitable way to use low quality farmland, though this trend is changing within the industry.Johnson, James E. et al. \\"Tree Crops for Marginal Farmland: Christmas Trees With a Financial Analysis \\", Virginia Cooperative Extension, Virginia Tech, March 1997.

Christmas tree farms can turn a profit in as little as six years, and though some overhead in equipment and labor does exist Christmas tree production requires only small amounts of up-front capital. Each tree can cost land owners $5-10 from the time it's planted as a seedling until it is harvested as a mature Christmas tree; that cost includes land costs, and costs accumulated through the growing process. In the early 21st century, Christmas tree farmers typically got annual returns of between $600-1,000 per acre of trees planted.Bondi, Mike. \\"An Introduction to Growing Christmas Trees \\", Oregon State University Extension Service, Oregon State University, via Washington State University.

Crop failures are also not uncommon which can negate years of work.Barney, D.L., and Finnerty, T.L. \\"Christmas trees is this the crop for you? \\", (PDF), Alternative Agricultural Enterprises, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Idaho, June 1995.

Fences, storage buildings, worker protection and pesticide regulations also add to the expenses of Christmas tree farms. Economic theory As this sign at a Christmas tree farm in Seattle demonstrates, most tree farmers do not price their trees per foot. A 2001 study attempted to make predictions about Christmas tree prices and the relationship between tree price and tree age, which corresponds to tree height. The study was based on data obtained from the prices of Christmas trees in North Carolina during December 1997 and used a Hotelling-Faustmann model for its predictions. The results showed, in general, that the change in prices reflected a competitive equilibrium in the capital market, thus support the Hotelling rule. Among the study's results was that, \\"prices across age cohorts increase at the rate higher than the interest rate.\\" The results also explained the mystery of why Christmas tree merchants do not price trees by the foot. Each foot of an older tree is more valuable than a foot of a younger tree; this is because the percentage increase in price per foot is adversely impacted by the declining growth rate as trees age.Vukina, Tomislav, et al.

The estimates incorporated survey data from 558 households in Washington, D.C., northern Virginia, southern Maryland and Philadelphia about Christmas tree display preferences. Using the results of empirical estimates derived from the survey the elasticity formula was used to arrive at the first known demand elasticity estimates ever completed for the natural Christmas tree market.Davis, George C. and Wohlgenant, Michael K. \\"Demand Elasticities from a Discrete Choice Model: The Natural Christmas Tree Market\\", (JSTOR), American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 75, No. 3, August 1993, pp. 730-738.

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia took over the project and pursued it until 1992, when it was suspended due to lack of funds.\\" Tu-2000 \\", astronautix.com, Retrieved 24 April 2010 Artist's impression of the Tu-2000 entering orbit around Earth.

Unflown Wings. Birmingham: Ian Allan Publishing. p. 75 Work on the project began in the 1970s. The Tupolev Design Bureau began the development of an aerospace plane with a launch weight of about . Various propulsion methods were considered, such as liquid rocket engine on fuel elements, aircraft nuclear propulsion, plasma engine, or an ion engine. The reason for the appearance of the Soviet Air Defense was the appearance of the US Space Shuttle. Works were activated in 1981. Three years later, an aerospace system based on a single-stage orbital aircraft with a liquid- propellant rocket engine was proposed, which could be launched both from the ground and from aircraft carriers. However, to increase efficiency and increase the fuel stock, a variant with a combined power plant of a turbojet engine, ramjet engine, and a liquid rocket engine was soon adopted, which became the prototype of the Tu-2000. The aircraft was designed as a tailless aircraft, and had an engine and triangular wing low extension located under fuselage. The core of the design was the power plant, which included: * 4 turbojet engines in the rear fuselage; * 1 main accelerating wide-range ramjet (located at the rear of the fuselage); * 2 liquid fuel rocket engines for maneuvering in vacuum (installed between the turbojets). The large number of engines was required to optimize efficiency in different flight modes. Most of the aircraft's volume was occupied by liquid hydrogen fuel tanks. The crew of two people was located in the nose of the fuselage. An automatic crew rescue system was to provide an escape route at all altitudes. The bow section, including the cabin, was detachable. Two escape options were considered: rescued by parachute e cockpit and an ejection seat. Radio and electronic equipment was located behind the flight deck. The nose strut chassis was removed in the same compartment. The middle and rear parts of the fuselage held the liquid hydrogen fuel tank. The liquid oxygen tank supplying oxidizer for the rocket engines was located in the tail of the fuselage. Liquid hydrogen was used as fuel for all engines and came from a single fuel system. The aircraft was designed with tricycle landing gear. The front gear had twin small diameter wheels with high pressure tyres. The main landing gear was to be single-wheeled, retracting to the fuselage compartments. The VKS was supposed to take off from standard runways up to long, fly back to subsonic speed after takeoff to reach the set starting point of acceleration and before landing for approach to a given airfield; carry out flights to change the airfield base, quickly perform acceleration to a given speed and altitude, including access to a circular orbit; perform multiple orbital maneuvers; perform an autonomous orbital flight of up to a day; perform cruising flight in the atmosphere with hypersonic speeds, perform deceleration with deceleration when returning from orbit; in the process of acceleration to orbital parameters and in the process of descending, perform maneuvering for the passage of a given route and exit to a given orbit and a given airfield; change the orbital flight plane. Acceleration of the work contributed to the information about the Rockwell X-30 project, a technology demonstrator for the US National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) project. In 1986, two government decrees were issued to develop a similar project. On September 1 of the same year, the Ministry of Defense was released technical task to single-stage reusable video conferencing, capable of solving problems in the atmosphere and near space and performing high-speed intercontinental transatmospheric transportation. It was planned to implement the project in two stages: # Creation of a Tu-2000A aircraft with a flight weight of and a speed of 6 Mach at an altitude of . The VKS was to be long; with a wing span of ; and a 70 degree leading edge wing sweep. # The second stage assumed various implementation options: Tu-2000B, MVKS, and a hypersonic airliner. * The Tu-2000B was a double bomber, which had a range of and a take-off weight of . Six engines provided a speed of Mach 6 at an altitude of . * The MVKS version was to have a take-off weight of , a flight ceiling of over , and a speed of Mach 15‚Äì25. It would carry a load of into a orbit. * Detailed study of the hypersonic liner proposal was not carried out, because it was not considered a priority. By the time of the collapse of the USSR the project was in full swing. Perestroika resulted in lower project costs. However, by December 1991, many structural elements had already been manufactured: the nickel alloy wing torque box, part of the fuselage, cryogenic fuel tanks, and composite fuel lines. For comparison, at the time the US X-30 project was stuck on an attempt to build a titanium alloy section of the fuselage. The Tu-2000 could have been completed by the year 2000, but circumstances had changed. Due to lack of funding in the summer of 1992, the project was declassified and had to be transferred to a commercial basis. The layout of the MVKS was presented at the Mosaeroshow-92 exhibition. The country's top leadership promised to support the project to raise the country's prestige, but did nothing. Soon, funding was discontinued altogether. At 1995 prices, the cost of building one Tu-2000 was estimated at $450 million, and the cost of development work estimated as $5.29 billion. At a rate of 20 starts per year, the cost of one start should have been $13.6 million. With adequate funding, the project could have been completed in 13‚Äì15 years, but in 1993 the Tu-2000 was cancelled.

Pine and fir trees, grown purposely for use as Christmas trees, are vulnerable to a wide variety of pests, weeds and diseases. Many of the conifer species cultivated face infestations and death from such pests as the balsam woolly adelgid and other adelgids. Aphids are another common insect pest. Christmas trees are also vulnerable to fungal pathogens and their resultant illnesses such as root rot, and, in the U.S. state of California, sudden oak death. Douglas-fir trees in particular are vulnerable to infections from plant pathogens such as R. pseudotsugae. Larger pests also pose a threat to Christmas tree plantations and harvests. Mammals such as deer, gophers and ground squirrels are threats to Christmas tree crops because of the damage they cause to roots and buds. Certain species of birds are also considered pests, among these is the pine grosbeak which feeds on conifer buds. Herbaceous weeds, as well as woody plants, also compete with Christmas tree crops for water and nutrients and thus must be controlled by farmers. There are several methods of control, including mowing, chemical herbicide use, and tilling. Insects An adult balsam woolly adelgid, a major pest in the Christmas tree industry The conifer species used and cultivated as Christmas trees are vulnerable to dozens of different pests, most of which cause cosmetic damage to the trees, important in the Christmas tree industry.Christmas Tree Pest Manual, Michigan State University Extension, United States Department of Agriculture, 1997‚Äì1998, Table of Contents.

Regardless of the types of plants, from herbaceous weeds to woody plants, weeds are considered a pest to Christmas tree farms for several reasons. Seedlings are vulnerable to the competition for water and nutrients presented by weed infestations, however, even established trees can be out competed by weed growth. Some specific weeds cause more serious problems, the bracken fern can increase disease in fir trees, and employee morale and efficiency are decreased when weeds such as poison oak, Canada thistle and wild blackberries infest plantations. In addition, excessive weed growth can provide cover for wildlife, such as deer, gopher and field mice, which can have damaging effects on Christmas tree crops.William R.D. and Al-Khatib, K.

In applying herbicides growers must determine proper spray volume and timing.Johnson, James E. and Torbert, John L. Christmas tree production , Introduction to Growing Christmas Trees in Virginia, Virginia Cooperative Extension, Virginia Tech, March 1997. Retrieved September 7, 2007. There are different types of herbicides that are used to control different types of weeds, they fall into two different categories. Soil applied herbicides combat germinating seedlings, and some offer control of newly established plants. Uniform application over the soil followed by moisture are required for soil applied herbicides to work effectively. Foilar- active herbicides control weed growth of already established, actively growing plants. Application of foliar-active herbicides requires farmers to avoid contact with the conifers. Non chemical methods of weed control include rotary mowing and flailing. Rotary mowing is designed to cut unwanted vegetation 5‚Äì7 cm (2‚Äì3 inches) above the surface of the soil while flailing cuts the vegetation near the soil surface. This method of weed control reduced the loss of soil moisture and nutrients by reducing the size and the growth of the weeds. The act of cultivation disturbs weed growth, especially in the seedling phase, as well by disrupting the soil around roots. Another method of combating problem weeds, in areas that have not responded to other control methods, is the practice of spot hoeing or tilling.

He was the founder and majority shareholder of Zion Wildlife Gardens Ltd, which featured on television programme The Lion Man. Zion Wildlife Gardens is now named Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary. Background Busch has said that while spending time in Utah, in a mountainous region populated with wild cougars, he developed a friendship with one of these cougars and realised that interacting with big cats was his mission in life. Later he spent time in Hollywood as an animal handler for studios and wealthy individuals. On his return to New Zealand in 1996, Busch built Zion Wildlife Gardens, initially in Kerikeri where he leased a property from the Cornelius family, and then relocated it to the current site, north of Whangarei. In 2002 Busch purchased five white tigers from Bonnie Ringo of Cave Junction, Oregon in the United States. Zion Wildlife Gardens Busch said he aimed to breed big cats to increase their numbers. In 2005, Busch arranged the exchange of New Zealand's first natively born white tigers, Tane and Aotea (born January 2005), and later Kiwi and Rongo (born 2 October 2005), with a white lion cub named Gandor from the Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve near Johannesburg. Busch featured in the reality series The Lion Man, which became one of New Zealand's biggest selling television series internationally. The series was shown in more than 130 different countries. In January 2006, Auckland builder Robert Reece alleged Busch owed him NZ$400,000. Reece had planned to take court action to recover the debt during the following month. Reece claimed he had financed the majority of the zoo facilities at Zion Wildlife Gardens. He also had claimed he had paid NZ$80,000 for Busch to go to the USA and obtain five white tigers for the park. Reece had been involved with Busch since around 2000. In 2007, Busch was convicted in the Whangarei District Court of assaulting his former partner Karen Greybrook in 2005. Greybrook sustained a cut to her head, a fractured vertebra and bruising. Greybrook died from unrelated complications during September 2011 in Australia, where she had resided for some years after the assault. In November 2008, Busch was dismissed from Zion Wildlife Park. In the years that followed, Busch and his mother Patricia battled in court over ownership of the park and its assets. At the end of May 2009, serious allegations were made against Busch by Zion Wildlife Gardens park staff. The allegations included the inhumane killing of unwanted cubs with rocks, beating of two lions with a short stick, and putting the lives of staff at risk by having them run with tigers. It was alleged that one of the staff members had been jumped upon by one of the tigers, and the animal had gone for the keeper's throat. The tiger had been forced off by another staff member. Busch denied the allegations. In June 2011, the Northern Advocate reported Busch had been taken to court by Whangarei-based lawyer Wayne Peters for unpaid legal fees amounting to a total of $86,351.47, relating to various legal services provided for a period of seven months during 2009. Peters had applied for summary judgement, after attempts to serve Busch with court documents in 2010 had failed. The presiding judge had declined summary judgement, due to Busch being overseas. In August 2011, Busch attempted to have his mother Patricia Busch adjudicated bankrupt over an alleged debt of $3800. Associate Judge Bell declined to hear the case on the day, and set a later hearing date set for October that year. In October, Busch then withdrew the bankruptcy proceedings, after Associate Judge Bell ordered Busch to pay $3800 as security costs for a hearing to proceed. During mid- January 2012, the Northern Advocate reported a defamation suit was being taken against Busch and his spokeswoman Jill Albrow for statements and actions taken relating to a video uploaded on YouTube in August 2010. On 31 January 2012, Zion Wildlife Gardens was sold by receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers to Zion Wildlife Kingdom Limited. Busch also returned as a self-employed contractor, fulfilling a specialist animal handler role at the facility. In February 2012, current affairs programme Campbell Live revealed Busch had not reported injuries to a young boy by a lion cub, during his tenure as operator of Zion Wildlife Gardens. Former park workers also alleged that Busch had lost a finger after it had been bitten off by the white lion Gandor. Footage included in the programme also showed Busch pulling a lion on a chain, and of one animal being subjected to physical punishment. In April 2012, the park reopened under the name Kingdom of Zion. In the same month, the New Zealand- based current affairs programme Campbell Live aired an item concerning serious allegations made against Busch by Ed Hern of the Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve, and Fred Berrange of the Leopard Conservation Project, both based in South Africa, of unpaid loans and stolen film footage. In the same news item, questions were also raised about Busch's dealings with the finances of the defunct UK charity Big Cat Rescue Trust (UK). In August 2013, Busch's former lawyer Wayne Peters again took action against his former client for unpaid legal fees. Presiding judge John McDonald ruled that Busch was required to pay the sum of $86,351.47 for the legal work carried out, as well as interest and costs. Declawing at the Park From 2000 to 2008, during Busch's tenure as Zoo Operator, 30 (21 lions and 9 tigers) of the big cats were declawed, a \\"restricted\\" surgical procedure in New Zealand. No legal action was taken against Mr Busch. ERA (Employment Relations Authority) On 3 November 2008 Busch was dismissed from his role as Operator of Zion Wildlife Gardens by the companies.

Cornelissen was the second of five children of Johannes Cornelissen, carpenter in Den Bosch, Noord Brabant, and Mechelina van Wijk. He became a primary school teacher in Middelburg, Zeeland. In the late 1880s he started working for Recht voor Allen (\\"Justice for All\\"), the organ of the Social Democratic League (in Dutch: Sociaal-Democratische Bond, SDB). Next to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, he soon became a leader in the SDB, member of the central committee and head of the international secretariat. He stayed in the SDB, which was renamed to Socialist League, during the breakaway of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (in Dutch: Sociaal Democratische Arbeiders Partij, SDAP). He attended the second congress of the Second International in Brussels, both as a special correspondent of Recht voor Allen and as a delegate of the Dutch railworkers' union contributing to an anti-militarist resolution by the left wing at the congress. In 1891, he translated the Communist Manifesto to Dutch. In 1893, he was one of the founders of the National Labor Secretariat (in Dutch: Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat; NAS). In the following year, he got to know the French anarchist and trade-unionist Fernand Pelloutier and he supported the anarchists expelled from the 1893 Zurich congress of the Second International. The increasing influence of social democrats within the Socialist League led Cornelissen to move to Paris in 1898. However, he remained in contact with the syndicalist movement in the Netherlands and continued writing for the Volksblad and several anarchist periodicals. In France, he worked with a lot of the anarchists he had gotten to know in Zurich. Since he spoke both German and English in addition to French and Dutch, he was particularly useful as a translator. He contributed to La Voix du peuple and La Bataille syndicaliste under the pseudonym \\"Rupert\\" (a reference to his wife Elisabeth Katharina Frederike (Lilian) Rupertus whom he had married in October 1899), as he feared deportation should his anarchist activities become public. In 1903, Rupertus gave birth to the couple's son Fred. Cornelissen's international contacts were also useful in organizing the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam, which served to establish relations between anarchists worldwide. From 1907, he edited the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. He also played an important role in organizing the 1913 International Syndicalist Congress in London. During World War I, Cornelissen actively supported the Union sacr√©e, a patriotic truce between the French state and the socialist movement. He wrote several anti- German brochures in support of the war, and was a signatory of the Manifesto of the Sixteen. His support for the war estranged Cornelissen from many of his syndicalist and anarchist comrades. After the war, he primarily dedicated himself to his economic studies. In 1944, his Trait√© g√©n√©ral de science √©conomique (General Treatise on the economic science), an elaboration on Th√©orie de la valeur (Theory of value), which he had published in 1903, to refute the labor theory of value, which both the classic economists and Marx adhered to, was published. He died in 1942 in Domme. References *Lorry, Anthony: Cornelissen, Christian (1864-1942).

The facility houses a collection of four species of large cats and was formerly used as a location for the filming of the television series The Lion Man. History  Zion Wildlife Gardens Craig Busch established Zion Wildlife Gardens in 2002 from bare land situated on Gray Road, Kamo, Whangarei. Busch had previously had the zoo based at Kerikeri. During 2006 Zion Wildlife Gardens became financially troubled. Busch accepted a bail out package from his mother Patricia Busch, and in accordance with an agreement dated 13 July 2006, he resigned as director and appointed Mrs Busch, as sole director. Busch continued working at Zion until his dismissal on 3 November 2008. During November 2008, media reports revealed an investigation into the welfare of the cats at the zoo had been conducted by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Concerns included animals being kept in unsanitary conditions, damaged enclosures and the surgical declawing of 21 lions and 9 tigers. In February 2009, the Ministry of Primary Industries (formerly MAF) released the results of its investigation into the surgical declawing of 21 lions and 9 tigers at the facility between the years 2000 to May 2008. The contents of the report revealed vets had been initially approached by Mr Busch to have the procedures done. Busch had requested the procedures were to be kept in confidence. The findings in the report found any question of prosecutions under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 were problematic due to Ministry of Primary Industries veterinarians being aware, but not questioning the procedures at the time. On 27 May 2009 a zookeeper, South African National Dalu Mncube, was mauled to death by a white tiger while cleaning an enclosure. The tiger was shot dead in order to reach Mncube. The same tiger, a male named Abu, had bitten another handler earlier the same year, who was rescued by Mncube. The park closed and re-opened after less than one month, following changes to the big cat enclosures to improve safety for handlers and the public. During June 2013 Zion Wildlife Gardens operator Patricia Busch lost her assets. The finance company that held the security over the property took possession, after Mrs Busch was unable to continue the mortgage payments. In December 2013, the Coroner's report on the inquest into the death of senior cat handler Dalu Mncube cleared the management and staff of any wrongdoing in relation to the incident. Shortland recommended regulatory reform and new legislation for health and safety in zoos and animal parks. Receivership David Bridgman and Colin McCloy of Price Waterhouse Coopers Limited were appointed receivers of the company that operated Zion Wildlife Gardens, Zion Wildlife Gardens Limited (In Receivership & In Liquidation), on 26 July 2011. Subsequent to this, the official assignee was appointed liquidator of the company on 22 August 2011, after the Inland Revenue made a successful application to the High Court to have Zion Wildlife Gardens Ltd placed into liquidation. On 31 January 2012 the receivers announced the sale of Zion Wildlife Gardens Ltd. to Zion Wildlife Kingdom Ltd. The receivers had been on site that morning to advise those at the park of the sale. Details of the sale were considered to be commercially sensitive and as a result, the receivers did not comment further on the sale and purchase agreement or the new owners. Kingdom of Zion On 31 January 2012, the park with land and assets, was sold to Zion Wildlife Kingdom Ltd, owned by Tauranga-based accountant Ian Stevenson and Cambridge based businesswoman Tracey McVerry and Nicholas Mes. On 5 April 2012 the facility was reopened as Kingdom of Zion. The day-to-day management of the facility was through Earth Crest Limited which had as its sole shareholder Suzanne Eisenhut. On May 10, 2012, Zion Wildlife Kingdom co-director and shareholder, Tauranga based chartered accountant Ian Stevenson, was censured by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, and was ordered to pay the $42,889 cost of his prosecution. Stevenson pleaded guilty to three charges arising from a client complaint; dealing with client monies through his practice account rather than a trust account, withdrawing fees without authority and preparing accounts without due care and diligence. In April 2013, Tauranga based business consultant Sam Bailey failed when he applied the High Court in Tauranga to have the park's operating company Earth Crest Limited, placed into liquidation. . Associate High Court Judge Jeremy Doogue reserved his decision into the application made by Bailey to liquidate Earth Crest Ltd (trading as Kingdom of Zion Ltd) after the hearing in May 2013. In October 2013, the Employment Relations Authority gave former worker Neville Bradford leave to pursue an unjustified dismissal claim against Kingdom of Zion's operating company Earth Crest Limited. Bradford had been dismissed in July 2012, after working at Kingdom of Zion as a groundsman since the end of January 2012. In November 2013, Zion Wildlife Kingdom Ltd co-director and shareholder Ian Stevenson, was struck off by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Stevenson was charged with conduct unbecoming of an accountant and negligence and/or incompetence in a professional capacity. He was also charged with breaching the NZICA's rule 21.4(b) and breaching the institute's code of ethics. On January 31, 2014 the shareholding and directorship of Zion Wildlife Kingdom Ltd, was transferred to Bolton Equities Ltd an Auckland-based investment company. During May 2014, the Employment Relations Authority ruled Earth Crest Ltd, the company operating the business Kingdom of Zion, was required to pay former employee Neville Bradford the sum of $11,000. The amount related to unpaid wages owed to Bradford by his employer. The Authority also found Bradford had not been unjustifiably dismissed by Earth Crest Limited. In July 2014, the Ministry of Primary Industries ordered the zoo to close to the public until the enclosures were upgraded to meet containment requirements. During early August, the business operated by Earth Crest Limited was purchased by Bolton Equities. The company planned to upgrade the zoo facility for a future major tourist attraction with the name changed to Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary.  Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary  Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 2014 by Bolton Equities after the Ministry of Primary Industries closed its predecessor Kingdom of Zion citing compliance issues. In 2015 it was reported the zoo was still closed as Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary management worked its way through a list of remedial work required.

The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham is a book by biblical scholar Thomas L. Thompson, Professor of Old Testament Studies at the University of Copenhagen. Together with John Van Seters's Abraham in History and Tradition (1975), this book marked the culmination of a growing current of dissatisfaction in scholarly circles with the then-current consensus (or near-consensus) on the Patriarchal narratives. The consensus can be summarized as the proposal that, even if archaeology could not directly confirm the existence of the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob), these Patriarchal narratives had originated in a second millennium BC setting because many personal names, place names, and customs referenced in the Genesis narratives were unique to that era. This view was expressed by John Bright in his influential History of Israel (1959, 2nd edition 1960) in these words; \\"one is forced to the conclusion that the patriarchal narratives authentically reflect social customs at home in the second millennium rather than those of later Israel\\".John Bright, \\"History of Israel\\", quoted in Martin J. Selman, \\"Comparative Customs and the Patriarchal Age\\" Thompson and Van Seters pointed out that, in fact, none of the archaeological evidence cited by the dominant scholars of the time (notably William F. Albright, E. A. Speiser, Cyrus Gordon, and Bright himself) actually provided irrefutable proof for the historicity of the Patriarchal narratives. \\"Not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the patriarchal traditions to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely.\\"\\"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives\\", p.328, quoted in review by Dennis Pardee in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 36, No.3 (July 1977) Albright's reputation never quite recovered from the publication of Thompson's book.P.R.F.

The MX-7 is a modified British \\"Ferret\\" Mk2 scout car, imported and modified by a Filipino used- metalworking and machining company called Steelcraft. This is the same company that produced such armored vehicle prototypes as the MX-1 \\"Kalakian\\", and the MX-8. The latter was evaluated at the same time as the MX-7. Despite being agile and fast, it is vulnerable to local RPG rounds, although it can deflect 7.62 millimetre rounds at point-blank range. Features The MX-7 has a crew of two. It is designed as a scout and reconnaissance vehicle, armed with a single 7.62 mm machine gun in a one-man turret. It is also fitted with six smoke grenade launchers. Steelcraft modifications were a diesel engine, modified drivetrain with five-speed preselected transmission and upgraded windshields. Compared to its primary competitor, the MX-8, the MX-7 is reportedly cheaper. However, long-term maintenance costs are expected to be higher since most of its specialized components, estimated at 50% of the vehicle, are not commercially available in the Philippines.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It seats approximately 400 people. History The opera house's predecessor, a simple meetinghouse and community space, was built in 1898 by the Marysville chapter of the Independent Order of Oddfellows. The wooden building was destroyed in a fire in 1910, and it was decided shortly thereafter to build a replacement venue out of another material. The new opera house was built the following year by local contractor A.E. Heider, at a cost of $20,000 (). The cornerstone was laid on March 26 and construction was finished by August 1911. The new building was designed to grow with the city and serve social functions as well as traveling shows. It was the second known structure in Snohomish County, Washington to use poured concrete, rather than timber or masonry, in its construction. The Oddfellows' Marysville lodge was disbanded in 1966, and the opera house later served as a roller skating rink, shooting range, furniture store, and a disco nightclub over the next two decades. The Marysville Fine Arts Committee successfully placed the building on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the city's only entry, and hoped to restore the building but were unable to raise enough money to do so. The city of Marysville began leasing the opera house from the Williams family in 1998, who renovated the building after years of neglect left the building with a leaking roof. It reopened in March 2001, allowing the city to rent it out for private events. A second renovation in 2016 included the repainting of the building, installation of LED lighting, and new artwork. In 2017, it hosted 138 events. The city government purchased the Opera House in January 2018 for $1.44 million, aiming to continue booking events while revitalizing the surrounding riverfront area.

The enemy also used artillery fire and air support in this engagement. Two enemy tanks were destroyed and two captured, with several enemy killed. The commanding officer Col. Nolan was killed by an enemy artillery shelling the next morning while supervising operations. It was a major loss to the battalion. The battalion was visited by then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Defence Minister Kamraj, the Chief of Army Staff and other senior officers. Kali Panchwin was awarded the battle honour \\"Hussainiwala\\" for its role in the 1965 War. It was among the first units to be moved to the Naga Hills counter-insurgency operations where they fought many successful missions. In an ambush Captain E.J. Tucker lost his life along with several men; for his bravery he was awarded the Ashoka Chakra Award Class I, the highest peacetime gallantry award. After spending time in Firozpur and Fazilka, the unit was deployed to Sikkim. It celebrated its bicentenary in Pune in 1974 with Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw as chief guest. The unit was then deployed to Gulmarg Heights along the Line of Control on the border with China.

Baynton is approximately north-east of Kyneton, and north-west of Lancefield. Baynton's elevation varies from 450 to 650 metres (1,475-2,130 ft) above sea level, and rainfall averages per annum. Agriculturally the region produces wool, lamb, beef and wine. Baynton is home to several wineries, and tourism has become an important component of the region's economy.  History  Baynton is named after an early pioneer of the area, Dr. Thomas Baynton, whose extensive station was named 'Darlington', and although the original homestead no longer remains, Darlington remains a significant local property. The Baynton area was previously occupied by Aboriginal people, and was the approximate meeting point of three tribal areas including Dja Dja Wurrung, Taungurong, and Woiwurrung. The Tachylite deposits near Spring Hill and the Coliban River may have been important trade goods as stone artefacts from this material have been found around Victoria.Clark, V. and Howes, J. 2010. Calder Freeway Faraday to Ravenswood, Harcourt North Section: Archaeological Monitoring During Construction. Report to VicRoads European settlement began in the 1830s with the arrival of Captain Sylvester Brown, who travelled overland with livestock from Sydney to set up an agricultural enterprise in Baynton. His residence however was short lived, and he was followed by a succession of landholders including Dr. Baynton, the Polhman brothers, Martin McKenna (first president of the Shire of Kyneton) and J.B. Thomson.J.O. Randall 'A history of pastoral settlement in the Campaspe district' One notable event in the early history of Baynton was the passing of the Burke and Wills expedition in 1860, and the departure from Baynton was recorded by the expedition artist Ludwig Becker, whose sketch is housed at the State Library of Victoria. Local resident J.B. Thomson alleged he joined Burke and Wills with the intention of travelling to northern Australia, but abandoned the party in Echuca, describing the expedition as 'reckless and bound to failure'. Bushranger Ned Kelly is fabled to have stolen a horse from the public house opposite the Baynton Racecourse. Local legend says the horse's owner, J.B. Thomson bet on a race with a stranger to the district, and when he won, they two went for a drink. The stranger then stepped out to check his horse, but did not return, stealing the faster horse, and disappearing from the district. He was later found to be none other than Ned Kelly. Baynton township developed in the 1860s and the Post Office opened on 24 January 1867, closing in 1959.  Baynton today  At its height as an identifiable town, Baynton was home to three schools, a church, two public houses and a cobbler shop. Today only the Hall remains, and it is used for community meetings and events. The Baynton Church, which was built in the late 1800s and rebuilt in the 1960s was destroyed in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, and will not be rebuilt. Baynton remains a close knit agricultural community, with a variety of enterprises including sheep, cattle, wine production and commercial forestry. The Baynton Hall, established in the early 1960s, is the home of the Baynton Film Society, and screens an Australian-based movie each year, on or around Australia Day. The Baynton-Sidonia Landcare group is active in working toward sustainable land management in the region. Due to the relative absence of subdivision in the Baynton area, it remains one of the most intact farming areas in the Macedon Ranges area. April 2012 saw celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Baynton Hall, and a book of the history of Baynton was launched at the 50th Anniversary celebrations. Baynton has been recognised as 'possibly the most well signposted place which does not exist as a recognisable town' due to the number of prominent signs directing to Baynton.  People of note  Thomas Alexander Browne, (who wrote under the pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood) was an early Australian writer, and author of the novel 'Robbery Under Arms'. Thomas Browne was the son of Captain Sylvester Brown, and was a resident of Baynton as a young boy. Walker Thomson, a member of the Australian forces in the South African War (1899‚Äì1902) was involved in the siege of Mafeking and became a friend of General Robert Baden-Powell was born and raised in Baynton.

History Museums in the Brody Raion have old traditions. Those traditions are found in the collections of the Pidhirtsi Castle (the 17th-18th centuries), the collections of Count Vladimir Dzedushyckiy at his estate in the village of Penyaki (the end of the 19th century), a private museum of pictures and ancient furniture of a castle palace proprietress in Brody, Countess Zhyshchevska (the beginning of 20th century), and others. Unfortunately, as a result of military activities and social cataclysms those collections were nebulized to different cities and museums of Ukraine and other countries. A lot of priceless artifacts were lost beyond retrieval. The first district museum in Brody (district, meaning raion or regional) was created at the end of the 1950s. It was a one-story house on the street of Velyki Filvarky. Collections of numismatists, plain weapons, ceremonial objects, saved in the museum, document the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century ethnography of region. At the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1970s, however, the exhibition was closed down and a considerable part of the exhibits disappeared. Soon the construction of a musical school began in the place of the museum. In 1979 several apartments of the 18th century building, in the walls of which from 1866 to 1939 was located Brody powiat government, were passed to occupy the museum. Between 1980-1984 a display was created and collection of exhibits passed. The opening of the new Brody Raion Museum that took place in September 1984 fell within the framework of celebrating the 900 anniversary of the first written reference of the Brody settlement. At first the establishment operated as a folk museum, and from April 1, 1991 became a department of the Lviv Historical Museum. On March 29, 2001, based on the Brody Raion Department of History and Ethnography of the Lviv Historical Museum, there was created the Brody Raion Museum of History and Ethnography. Displays The museum display consists of 43 sections, built on the chronological principle in seven halls. The history of the district is divided by themes: #The most ancient times (from the Stone Age to the Kievan Rus) #Polish days (from the end 14th-18th centuries) #Region under the Austrian empire (1772‚Äì1918) #The First World War (1914‚Äì1918), national liberation movements (1918‚Äì1919), Polish-Soviet War (in 1920); #Inter-War period (1920‚Äì1939); #World War II (1939‚Äì1945), fight of OUN, UPA in Brody district (1940-50th).

Parigot. It introduces two new operators: the Œº operator (which is completely different both from the Œº operator found in computability theory and from the Œº operator of modal Œº-calculus) and the bracket operator. Proof-theoretically, it provides a well- behaved formulation of classical natural deduction. One of the main goals of this extended calculus is to be able to describe expressions corresponding to theorems in classical logic. According to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, lambda calculus on its own can express theorems in intuitionistic logic only, and several classical logical theorems can't be written at all. However with these new operators one is able to write terms that have the type of, for example, Peirce's law. Semantically these operators correspond to continuations, found in some functional programming languages. Formal definition We can augment the definition of a lambda expression to gain one in the context of lambda-mu calculus. The three main expressions found in lambda calculus are as follows: #\`V\`, a variable, where V is any identifier. #\`ŒªV.E\`, an abstraction, where V is any identifier and E is any lambda expression. #\`(E E‚Ä≤)\`, an application, where E and E'; are any lambda expressions. For details, see the corresponding article. In addition to the traditional Œª-variables, the lambda-mu calculus includes a distinct set of Œº-variables. These Œº-variables can be used to name or freeze arbitrary subterms, allowing us to later abstract on those names. The set of terms contains unnamed (all traditional lambda expressions are of this kind) and named terms. The terms that are added by the lambda-mu calculus are of the form: #\`[Œ±]t\` is a named term, where Œ± is a Œº-variable and t is an unnamed term. #\`(Œº Œ±. E)\` is an unnamed term, where Œ± is a Œº-variable and E is a named term. Reduction The basic reduction rules used in the lambda-mu calculus are the following: ; logical reduction : (\\\\lambda x.u)v \\\\; \\\\triangleright_c \\\\; u[v/x] ; structural reduction : (\\\\mu \\\\beta.u)v \\\\; \\\\triangleright_c \\\\; \\\\mu \\\\beta.u \\\\left [ [\\\\beta](w v)/[\\\\beta] w \\\\right ] ; renaming : [\\\\alpha] \\\\mu \\\\beta.u \\\\; \\\\triangleright_c \\\\; u [\\\\alpha / \\\\beta] ; the equivalent of Œ∑-reduction : \\\\mu \\\\alpha.[\\\\alpha]u \\\\; \\\\triangleright_c \\\\; u, for Œ± not freely occurring in u These rules cause the calculus to be confluent. Further reduction rules could be added to provide us with a stronger notion of normal form, though this would be at the expense of confluence.

Among the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the festival were performers such as David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi. On 22 September of the same year, the national premiere of George Enescu's lyrical tragedy \\"Oedipe\\" took place, starring a young David Ohanesian in the lead role. This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub). Violinist, teacher, conductor and composer, worldwide known for his lush opera composition Oedipe, George Enescu presented his first work as a composer with the Collonne Orchestra in Paris, 1898; he also performed as a conductor at prestigious Carnegie Hall (NY). Enescu was also the teacher of one of the greatest violinists of the past century ‚Äì Lord Yehudi Menuhin. Their bond was so strong that in 1995, Menuhin accepted the invitation to come to Romania to open the George Enescu International Festival. Menuhin also accepted to be the President of Honor of the Enescu Festival in 1998, though his schedule as a soloist was full up to 2003. Today, an average of around 20 works by Romanian composer George Enescu are interpreted in the Enescu Festival each edition. The 2015 edition of the Enescu Festival (30 August ‚Äì 20 September 2015 Bucharest) brings on stage interpretations from Enescu's works by record- breaking German violinist David Garrett, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (Pulitzer Prize for Music), or Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta. Highlights of this edition of the Festival also include violinist Anne- Sophie Mutter, Berliner Philharmoniker, London Symphony Orchestra and Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra. The concerts are held in three different venues in Bucharest, Ia»ôi and Sibiu. The 2007 presentations ended with a performance of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana before an audience of over 4,000 at the Sala Palatului. The competition portion of the Festival lasts about a week, and it consists of three different categories: composition (118 participants in 2007), piano (44 in 2007), and violin (41 in 2007), each a record number of participants. In the 2005 and 2007 presentations a daily open-air concert was added to the festival program. It is known as the Festival Piazza and features 3¬Ω hours of classical music, in addition to movies about the life of George Enescu.

The festival was meant to occur once every three years, being accompanied by an international competition, that was interrupted after the 5th edition, only to be reintroduced in the festival in 1991. Among the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the show were performers such as Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi.

This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by: Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub).  1961 - Second edition  Compared to the first one, the second edition paid much more attention to repertoires from the lyrical theatre and vocal art. This initiative was supported by several renowned soloists such as Dimitr Uzunov, Ivan Petrov and Anton Dermota. Five lyrical spectacles were presented by the Bucharest Theatre of Opera and Ballet: ¬´ Oedipe ¬ª by George Enescu, ¬´Boris Godunov ¬ª by Modest Mussorgski, ¬´ Fidelio ¬ª by Ludwig van Beethoven, ¬´ Othello ¬ª by Giuseppe Verdi and ¬´ O Noapte FurtunoasƒÉ ¬ª by Paul Constantinescu, alongside two ballet acts in the forms of ¬´ La Piata ¬ª by Mihai Jora and ¬´ Priculiciul ¬ª by Zeno Vancea. For the first time, there were opened three new concert halls: the Grand Hall of the Palace, the Small Hall of the Palace (now the Auditorium Hall) and the Concert Studio of the Romanian Radiotelevision (now the Mihail Jora Concert Studio). In this edition participated the following: Sviatoslav Richter, Aldo Ciccolini, Leonid Kogan, Henryk Szeryng, Valentin Gheorghiu, ≈ûtefan Gheorghiu, Vladimir Orlov, Radu Aldulescu, Ion Voicu, Sir John Barbirolli (his second time at the George Enescu Festival), Lorin Maazel, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski with George Georgescu, Mircea Cristescu, Mircea Basarab, Iosif Conta and Mihai Brediceanu.  1964 ‚Äì The Third Edition  The third edition debuted with a regrettable event ‚Äì the death of the conductor George Georgescu, a few days after the beginning of the international event, depriving the Romanian stage of an indisputable artist. The success of the previous editions was reconfirmed in 1964 mainly by the presence of exceptional international artists such as: Arthur Rubinstein, Henryk Szering, Gaspar Cassado, Monique Haas, Miroslav Ceangalovici, Andr√© Navarra, Andr√© Cluytens, Herbert von Karajan, Zubin Mehta and John Pritchard. Beside them there were also Romanian artists such as Valentin and ≈ûtefan Gheorghiu, ≈ûtefan Ruha, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Vladimir Orlov, Mircea Basarab and Mihai Brediceanu. It was an edition of first auditions, among the most important being the interpretations of the poem Vox Maris (by the Radiotelevision Orchestra, conducted by Iosif Conta) and the Piano Quartet no. 1, both signed by George Enescu.  1967 ‚Äì 4th Edition  During the 1967 festival, a great importance was given again to promoting both Enescian music and Romanian contemporary creations. It was one of the editions when the highest number of George Enescu's musical pieces was auditioned (12) and when 18 Romanian composers were included in the concert programs. This edition also brought the first world audition of the Enescian creation: \\"Trio in A minor for violin, cello and piano\\". Other important first auditions were: \\"String Quartet No. 2\\" by Mihail Jora, \\"String Quartet No. 7\\" by Wilhelm Berger and \\"Scene nocturne\\" by Anatol Vieru. Besides the presence of Romanian orchestras and artists (Valentin Gheorghiu, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Mircea Basarab, Constantin Bugeanu and Antonin Ciolan, the \\"George Enescu\\" Philharmonic Orchestra, the Radiotelevision Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra in Cluj, the Madrigal Choir, the \\"George Enescu\\" Quintet or the \\"Muzica Quartet\\"), international performers or ensembles were also present, such as Los Angeles Philharmonic, Moscow State Philharmonic, Grand Paris Opera Ballet, Czech Nonet and Tatrai Quartet. These ones and other artists such as Van Cliburn, Isaac Stern, Claire Bernard, Friedrich Gulda, David Oistrah, Mstislav Rostropovich, Zubin Mehta, Kiril Kondrashin and Kurt Masur have filled the concert halls once again.  1970 ‚Äì 5th Edition  Due to the Beethoven bicentenary, an initial characteristic of this edition was the massive presence of the creation of Bonn titan ‚Äì 12 works interpreted ‚Äì during the festival. According to this and considering Enescu's affinity for the great classic, the Research Sector of the History of Art Institute, part of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences and the \\"George Enescu\\" Studies Center organized a round table with the theme \\"George Enescu and the Beethovian tradition\\". The international personalities who performed in 1970 on the Bucharest stages were Paul Badura- Skoda, Gyorgy Cziffra, Henryk Szeryng, Mstislav Rostropovich, Nicanor Zabaletta, Jean Pierre Rampal, who replaced Valentin Gheorghiu (who became unavailable in the last minute), Virginia Zeani, Paul Klecky and Andr√© Previn. If in the previous editions the range of instruments was reduced to piano, violin and cello, during this edition a greater variety was observed, by inviting the most notable harpist of the time, Nicanor Zabaletta, and the legendary flautist Jean Pierre Rampal. Probably the most important symphonic ensemble was the London Symphony Orchestra for which the Palace Grand Hall proved to be too small. Besides these two, other orchestras were also present such as the Opera and Ballet Theatre Orchestra in Leningrad, the Bach Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig and other chamber orchestras, such as the Juilliard American Quintet and the Gasparo da Salo Chamber Orchestra.  1973 ‚Äì 6th Edition  The sixth edition of the International Festival \\"George Enescu\\" was reduced to only one week, due to the discomfort presented by the political authorities, who considered an artistic manifestation of this kind to be a useless investment. Among the international soloists and conductors present this year were: Leonid Kogan, who replaced Sviatoslav Richter, who was supposed to perform in the opening concert, Yehudi Menuhin, Philippe Entremont, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski and Radmila Bakocevici. Artists were invited exclusively on political criteria, most of them coming from socialist countries or from the ones sympathizing with the doctrine of the communist government. Three from the five international orchestras come from the communist countries.  1976 ‚Äì 7th Edition  This year, the Festival did not include a competition and an organizing committee. Also, the International Musicology Symposium did not benefit from the participation of international researchers, becoming a national symposium. The soloists and the orchestras invited to participate in the festival were again selected based on political criteria. Among the notable international personalities, the Romanian public could attend the concerts of Pierre Cochereau, Christian Ferras, Grace Bumbry, Victoria de Los Angeles, and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, three years before the retirement of the great artist. There were four international ensembles present: the Hungarian Symphony Radiotelevision Orchestra in Budapest, the Madrigals in Belgrad, Moscow Chamber Orchestra and the \\"Studio der Fr√ºhen Musik\\" Vocal-Instrumental Quartet. Among the Romanian artists could be mention: Radu Lupu, ≈ûtefan Ruha, Ludovic Bacs, Mircea Basarab, Mihai Brediceanu, Iosif Conta, Emil Simion and Cornel TrƒÉilescu.  1979 ‚Äì 8th Edition  The Festival ¬´ George Enescu ¬ª was becoming rather a national manifestation, as a shadow of the Competition \\"C√¢ntarea Rom√¢niei\\", which could thus celebrate its laureates at an international artistic level. Despite this drawback, this year's edition had a few remarkable guests, such as Nikita Magaloff, Viktor Tretiakov, Ludwig H√∂lscher and Sheila Armstrong. The international instrumental ensembles that came to Bucharest had a chamber music repertoire (Deutsche Kammerakademie, the Sextet Gabrielli Brass Ensemble and the Contemporary Music Atelier in Poland). A novelty was the presence of two choreographical ensembles: Alvin Ailey Ballet Company from the US and Miyagi Minoru Traditional Dance Troupe from Japan.  1981 ‚Äì 9th Edition  Although the organizers did not dispose of great funds, they made efforts to start this edition, with the occasion of the 100 years anniversary from the birth of George Enescu. Some of the international personalities present were: Annerose Schmidt, Fran√ßois Jo√´l Thiollier, Vladimir Spivakov, Emil Ceakarov, Isaac Karabtchiewisky and Herbert Kegel. Three of the seven musical troupes present in the festival were choreographical ensembles: Eurythmeum Troupe from Stuttgart, Lar Lubovitch Company and Sopianae Ballet Company. The critics had very good reviews for the Great Academic Theatre Ensemble of URSS which performed \\"The Queen of Spades\\" and \\"Iolanta\\" by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky and \\"Mozart and Salieri\\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, along with other famous pieces of the Russian, Italian and French romantic lyrical repertoire. From the Romanian personalities present at the festival we mention: Valentin Gheorghiu, Dan Grigore, Radu Lupu, Ion Voicu and many names of the lyrical stage such as: Victoria Mann, Emilia Petrescu, Mihaela Agachi, Ionel Pantea, Florin Diaconescu.  1985 ‚Äì 10th Edition  An unprecedented number of Romanian creations was registered at the 10th edition, being interpreted 80 contemporary works, an impressive number, considering that in the program were included only 76 Romanian composers. The Enescian creation was also generously represented, 25 works were interpreted, the highest number registered until then. Highly appreciated interpretations of the Enescian works were performed, among others, by Cristian Mandeal (\\"Third Suite\\") and Ion Baciu (\\"Second Symphony\\"). Internationally reputed interprets performing in the Festival were: Viktor Tretiakov, Siegfried Lorenz, Herbert Kaliga, Rudolf Innig, Jose Miguel Moreno Aguado and Jean P√©risson. There were only two international instrumental ensembles in this edition, due to limited funds, the Dolezal Quartet from Czechoslovakia and Brodsky Quartet from Great Britain.  1988 ‚Äì XI Edition  The 1988 edition took place during the Romanian Antheneum Centenary. Also, 120 years from the foundation of the \\"George Enescu\\" Philharmonic was celebrated that year. From the peak of the interpretative moments of George Enescu's creation we mention: \\"Symphony I\\" conductor Mihai Brediceanu, \\"Vox Maris\\" symphonic poem conducted by Iosif Conta, \\"Rapsody I\\" conducted by Yekoslav Sutej and \\"Two Intermezzi for String Orchestra\\" ‚Äì T√¢rgu- Mure»ô Chamber Orchestra. The international personalities who participated in this edition were Georges Pludermacher, Michael Roll, Levon Ambartumian and Ferdinang Klinda. During the festival, original moments were offered by Alexander Rudin, present both as a pianist and a cellist, in two concerts by J. Haydn and the French conductor Francoise Legrande.  1991 ‚Äì XII Edition  Starting with this edition, the first after the events of December 1989, the International Festival \\"George Enescu\\" begins to recapture its former glory. The combined efforts of the organizing institutions succeeded to bring to Bucharest international renowned guests. It was a new beginning, which resulted, in the coming editions, in an array of famous international music names. From the guest artists we mention: Mathias Weber, Jean Francois Antionioli, Gerhard Oppitz, Teiko MaMaehashi, Carlos Paita, Levon Ambartumian and Michiyoshi Inoue. Yolanda Marculescu, who had been the prima dona of the Romanian National Opera of Bucharest from 1948 to 1968, was invited to return to Romania as a juror in 1991. The Theatre of Classical Ballet from Kiev, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Percussionists from Hague, the Saint Martin in the Fields Chamber Orchestra, Rheinisches Barocktrio, and Concerto Averna from Warsaw were the international ensembles present in the festival.A distinctive feature of this festival was the presence of works such as \\"Missa Brevis\\" by Joseph Haydn, \\"Requiem\\" by Mozart, \\"Palestrina Missa Brevis\\" operas impossible to interpret in the communist era.  1995 ‚Äì 13th Edition  The allocated funds, the facilities and the authorities‚Äô desire to create a new international image of Romania in the 90's, led to organizing the 13th edition at incredible high standards. Thus, through the Government's Decision nr. 364/30 from 1995, the amount of 2.690.488 RON (approx. $2 million) was approved for organizing the festival, to which the financial support of the Romanian Radiotelevision Society was added. Important international names participated in this edition, such as: Lord Yehudi Menuhin, Lorin Maazel, Georges Pretre, Zubin Mehta, Yuri Temirkanov, Roberto Benzi, Sergiu Comissiona, Alberto Lissy, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Jean Pierre Rampal, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Saint Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Radio Television Orchestra in Madrid, along with the most important Romanian soloists and instrumental and vocal ensembles. One of the most controversial moments of this edition was the putting in stage of George Enescu's opera \\"Oedipe\\" by Andrei ≈ûerban. In this version, the key role was interpreted by two soloists: Sever Barnea ‚Äì young Oedipe and Nicolae Urdareanu ‚Äì old Oedipe. Andrei ≈ûerban gave the spectacle strong political connotations, which led to inevitable reactions.  1998 ‚Äì 14th Edition  In 1998, the anniversary of 40 years from the first International Festival ¬´ George Enescu ¬ª was celebrated. Complementary activities took place in the same time with the international event: recitals and concerts performed during the series \\"Romanian Music of the 20th century\\" (with the support of the National Radio Orchestra and the ensembles Archaeus, Concordia, Contraste, Romantica, Trio Modus), series entitled \\"Bach by Midnight\\", the International Seminar \\"George Enescu and the music of the 20th century\\" and the International Seminar I.A.M.A. with the theme \\"Development Directions of Managerial Cultural Exchanges\\". Twelve international music troupes participated in this year's edition: the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Chicago, the Tonhalle Zurich Orchestra, the French National Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Koln, the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, The Budapest Festival Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Virtuosi Orchestra, The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome, the Kremarata Baltika Chamber Orchestra and the Alban Berg Quartet. From the interprets and soloists present we mention: Viktoria Mullova, Gidon Kremer, Misha Maisky, Peter Donhoe, Peter Zimmermann, Shlomo Minz, Barbara Hendricks, Vladimir Spivakov, Yan Pascal Tortellier, Lawrence Foster, Daniel Barenboim, Lord Yehudi Menuhin, for the last time in front of the Romanian public, the maestro passed the following year.  2001 ‚Äì 15th Edition  The 2001 edition was by far the richest and most glamorous of all 15 editions of the festival. A lot of prestigious international artists performed on the Bucharest stages during the three-week festival. Among the participants of the 15th edition were: H√©l√®ne Grimaud, Vasko Vasiliev, Jean- Phillippe Collard, Rudolf Buchbinder, Maurice Andre, Maxim Vengerov, Pierre Amoyal, Isabelle Faust, Christian Zacharias, Cristoph Eschenbach, Laurent Petitgrard, Kurt Masur, Claus Peter Flor, Alexandros Myrat, Michel Plasson, Seiji Ozawa, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Leopold Hager, Sakari Oramo and Riccardo Mutti. Beside these world-renowned personalities were prestigious instrumental ensembles such as: the Paris Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Russian State Symphony Chapel, the Hamburg Radio Orchestra, Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Penderecki Festival Orchestra, Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne, London Chamber Orchestra, ‚ÄûSine Nomine\\" Quartet. The \\"By Midnight\\" concert series continued in this edition starting with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 17 operas were interpreted.  2003 ‚Äì 16th Edition  The organizers concentrated on promoting the contemporary Romanian creations, through the series entitled \\"Romanian Music of the 20th Century\\", during which important operas could be listened to, signed mostly by the most appreciated and prestigious Romanian composers. The International Contest ¬´ George Enescu ¬ª was organized a week before the Festival, allowing the finale and the Gala Concert to be included in the festival program. Similar to the precedent edition, the series \\"Midnight Concerts\\" continued, this year's focus being on Ludwig van Beethoven (\\"Beethoven by Midnight\\"), 26 of his works being interpreted. In 2003, there was an initiative to organize concerts in the Festival Market, idea which continued in the following editions. Therefore, the International Festival \\"George Enescu\\" symbolically greeted potential audiences, facilitating the access to classical music to those unfamiliar with the genre. The artistic excellence of the participants was confirmed also during this edition, when 11 international symphony orchestras performed, with Sir Collin Davis as conductor, the Orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (conducted by Zubin Mehta, a familiar presence in the program of the International Festival \\"George Enescu\\"), the Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome (with Myung Whun Chung as conductor), the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by Leif Segerstam), the Royal Stockholm Orchestra (conducted by Alain Gilbert) or the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Vladimir Fedoseev). The public could also see perform the Gulbenkian Orchestra from Lisbon or the Britten Sinfonia Ensemble from Great Britain.  2005 ‚Äì 17th Edition  The 2005 edition was organized for the commemoration of 50 years from the passing of the great composer. The objectives were to present and promote the Enescian creation to the prestigious artists invited, to promote the contemporary Romanian creations, to include the precedent editions laureates in the festival program and to open the festival to a jazz repertoire. As a premier, for this edition there were presented three important elements: Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos and orchestral suites, performed by King's Consort ensemble and Ludwig van Beethoven's concertos for piano, with Christian Zacharias as soloist. Besides King's Consort ensemble and Christian Zacharias, in this edition also participated: Kirov Theatre Symphony Orchestra with conductor Valery Gergiev, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta, and Nigel Kennedy.  2007 ‚Äì 18th Edition  This edition's pleasant surprises were offered by the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Murray Perahia, Martha Argerich, Trio Beaux Arts and the violinist Joshua Bell who replaced Maxim Vegherov (unavailable). The absence of the masterpiece \\"Oedipe\\" on the festival banners was criticized. Similar to the precedent edition, the variety of the repertoire can be noticed, great symphony hits or concerts were accompanied by other names, some of them quasi- famous to the large audience, coming from either the areas of old music, or from the most innovative areas of the contemporary music. This change is due to the type of ensembles invited, some of them being specialized in interpreting historical repertoires and others in contemporary ones. George Enescu's compositions were also present in this year's program.  2009 ‚Äì 19th Edition  The debut at the end of August was a premiere for this edition, which had seven musical themed directions (¬´ Romanian Contemporary Creation ¬ª, ¬´ Enescu and His Contemporaries ¬ª, ¬´ Midnight Concerts ¬ª, ¬´ Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation ¬ª, ¬´ Opera and Ballet ¬ª, ¬´ Great Orchestras ¬ª and ¬´ Chamber Concerts ¬ª) and a long and consistent program. The complexity of the repertoire, a feature of the previous festival editions, reached its peak this year. The fact that in 2007, \\"Oedipe\\" opera was not included on the festival banners led to criticism, therefore, this year's edition debuted with this spectacle, a co-production of the Capitole Theatre in Toulouse and the Romanian Opera in Bucharest. The commemoration of 200 years from the passing of Joseph Haydn in 2009, concluded in Haydn being the second composer in the top of works included in the festival program. The Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Christian Zacharias performed the music of the great Austrian maestro for three evenings, and was joined by the Ensemble le Musiciens du Loubre, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and the Munich Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra. The novelty of this edition was the concert series \\"Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation\\" as an alternative for jazz and world music lovers. From this series concert we mention Uri Caine and his troupe, Florin RƒÉducanu.  2011 - The 20th Edition  The 20th edition of the George Enescu International Festival and Competition presented and promoted the Enescu's works, the artistic and interpretative values of contemporary Romanian music, provided prestigious platform for launching value interpreters from among the younger generation and promoted the winners of previous editions.

A series dedicated to contemporary music - \\"Music of the 21st century\\" - brought together works by Romanian and foreign contemporary composers. The works were presented by bands and singers in Romania and abroad. The series was accompanied by a \\"workshop\\" attended by 17 young composers, master and doctoral university attendees from the country. A new entry in the Festival's program was the series \\"World Music\\", related to one of the essential contributions made by Enescu's Universal Music: use of specific national musical elements through symphony processing. This series was attended by composers and ensembles that brought elements from the Indian, Japanese, Argentinean, Yiddish, Lebanese, Moroccan and Romanian music. There were 8 theaters and concert halls (Hall of the Palace, Romanian Athenaeum, Bucharest National Opera, National Theatre \\"I. L Caragiale\\" National Art Museum Hall, \\"Mihail Jora\\" Hall at the Romanian Radio Society, Small Hall of the Romanian Athenaeum, National University of Music Bucharest) and an outside stage in The Festival's Square.

C. The Great Rock Discography. Pg. 5. Giunti, 1998. , also known as Dave Barbe) is a drummer and an author of British and Mauritian descent. As part of both Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, he was instrumental in creating the highly influential and innovative tribal drumming style that was popular among British and some American bands from 1979 to 1983. Adam and the Ants Barbarossa joined Adam and the Ants in 1977 and was the drummer for their debut album Dirk Wears White Sox. It was released on 30 October 1979 by Do It Records and was the first number one album on the UK Indie Chart when the chart debuted in Record Week in 1980. Shortly afterward, Adam Ant hired former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren in the hope of gaining more widespread recognition. Instead, McLaren persuaded Barbarossa, guitarist Matthew Ashman and bassist Leigh Gorman to leave Adam behind, and form a group under McLaren's management. Thirteen-year-old Annabella Lwin joined the group as its vocalist, and the band became Bow Wow Wow. Bow Wow Wow Bow Wow Wow signed with EMI Records in July 1980. Their first single, \\"C¬∑30 C¬∑60 C¬∑90 Go!\\", for which Barbarossa shared songwriting credit with McLaren, Ashman and Gorman, holds the distinction of being the world's first-ever cassette single. It reached No. 34 on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for seven weeks, despite its lack of promotion due to lyrics that encouraged music piracy. In November 1980, Bow Wow Wow released the cassette-only Your Cassette Pet. Likewise, Barbarossa shared songwriting credit with McLaren, Ashman and Gorman on seven of Your Cassette Pet's eight tracks. As it was not available on vinyl, it was eligible only for the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 58. EMI dropped the group after their second single \\"W.O.R.K. (N.O. Nah, No No My Daddy Don't)\\" failed to chart. After splitting with EMI, Bow Wow Wow signed with RCA Records, and released their first full-length album See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah. City All Over! Go Ape Crazy in October 1981. It produced their first UK top 10 hit \\"Go Wild in the Country\\" in early 1982. In May 1982, Bow Wow Wow released the four-track EP The Last of the Mohicans, which contained a remake of the Strangeloves' 1965 hit \\"I Want Candy'. \\"I Want Candy\\" was Bow Wow Wow's biggest international hit, due in part to an iconic music video that palyed in heavy rotation on MTV. In 1983, Bow Wow Wow released their second full-length album When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going. The lead single \\"Do You Wanna Hold Me?\\" reached No. 47 in the UK, but fared best on the Dutch charts, where it peaked at No. 3. The song reached No. 77 in the U.S. The group were due to embark on a world tour in support of When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going, but tensions within the group were rising as the members were suffering from illness and exhaustion after intense touring. After a brief hiatus, Barbarossa, Ashman and Gorman kicked Annabella out of the group, and formed Chiefs of Relief with Ashman as its lead singer. Post Bow Wow Wow Barbarossa's stay with Chiefs of Relief proved short lived, and he was soon replaced by former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook. After which, Barbarossa went into session drumming, and was part of Beats International's ever changing line-up. It was while doing session work that he teamed up with former Flowered Up keyboardist Tim Dorney, Andy Todd, guitarist Johnny Male and Nigerian-born lead singer Saffron to form Republica. Their debut album Republica was released in July 1996 and reached No. 4 in the UK charts. The single \\"Ready to Go\\" peaked at No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart, and \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" peaked at No. 7\\\\. He has played for Chicane, Adamski, Gina Birch, Cactus Rain, Driza Bone and is a core member of CHANT, an open source band whose members include Youth and Jon Moss. He played with Adam Ant on his Dirk Wears White Sox Tour of 2014. He also plays drums for Roland Gift of Fine Young Cannibals.  Raw Blue Wire  In 2019, Barbarossa formed Raw Blue Wire with Kendra Frost, who has supported Nine Inch Nails on their ‚ÄúCold and Black and Infinite‚Äù North American Tour in 2018 as a member of Kite Base, and played in Blindness with Debbie Smith. Mud Sharks In 2012, Barbarossa released Mud Sharks, a semi-autobiographical novel of a teenager growing up in London's punk scene in the late 1970s. Musical style Barbarossa is a self-taught musician. While he was still with the Ants, Malcolm McLaren gave him music tapes from different parts of the world, and he became fascinated by Burundi tribal drumming. Having emerged from the underground London punk rock scene, he created a highly unique tribal drumming style. Coupled with the suggestive lyrics squealed into the mic by their teenage lead vocalist, it became the signature of Bow Wow Wow's danceable new wave sound. Gorman & Lwin reunited for the \\"Barking Mad\\" tour in 1997-1998. Two shows from this tour were included on the CD Wild in the U.S.A. on Cleopatra Records. In the liner notes, they thank Barbarossa for giving them \\"the original grooves.\\" Personal life Barbarossa lives in London, and his desire not to leave London plays a large part in his desire not to participate in reunions for Bow Wow Wow. He has four children and has been married twice.

Since 2008, he has had multiple criminal convictions and has been an inmate in the Nevada Department of Corrections system since January 2014.  Liberace   Relationship  A teenaged Thorson met Liberace in 1976 through his romantic friendship with dancer Bob Street (a friend of Hollywood producer Ray Arnett) who was staging Liberace's shows in Vegas. When Thorson was 18, Liberace hired him to act as his personal friend and companion, a position that allegedly included a five-year romantic relationship with lavish gifts, travel, and Liberace's promises that he would adopt and care for Thorson. Liberace claimed that he had \\"more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor\\". Liberace also incorporated Thorson into his Las Vegas stage performances ‚Äì for example, Thorson drove Liberace's Rolls- Royce onstage, and was a dancer. According to Thorson, their committed relationship ended because of Liberace's promiscuous behavior and Thorson's drug addiction. Thorson also claimed that it was Liberace that originally started him on the drugs, but then when his habit got out of control, Liberace cut him off from all of his credit cards.Oprah: Where Are They Now? -Interview with Scott Thorson [TV Series]. (2013). United States: OWN TV (Oprah Winfrey Network). Thorson stated that following his plastic surgery, the surgeon provided for him a cocktail of highly addictive drugs that included cocaine, Quaaludes, biphetamines, and Demerol. Thorson stated that since he was so young at the time of meeting Liberace, he would do anything that he could to please him, including getting plastic surgery so that he could resemble him, but he felt that their relationship was one-sided. He called Liberace both generous and possessive. In 2000, Thorson was among several people featured in the British television documentary Liberace: Too Much of a Good Thing Is Wonderful. In 2002, Thorson was interviewed by Larry King on Larry King Live, during which Thorson confirmed that, in the midst of his relationship with Liberace, he chose to have plastic surgery to look more like Liberace at the pianist's suggestion. Also during the interview with King, Thorson revealed his chin implant had been removed earlier in 2002. Following his release from prison in 2012, Thorson gave interviews about his relationship with Liberace, one with Howard Stern, in June 2013, in which he talked about former lovers and affairs he had when he lived with Liberace. Another interview was on Entertainment Tonight in May 2012, where he stated that memories of his time with Liberace were still difficult for him.  Lawsuit and book  In 1982, after he was let go by Liberace,Liberace had last laugh on critics by 'crying all the way to the bank' The Pittsburgh Press, February 5, 1987 Thorson filed a $113 million lawsuit against Liberace, part of which was a palimony suit. This was the first same-sex palimony case filed in U.S. history. Thorson decided to sue because he claimed that Liberace threw him out on the streets with nothing. Liberace continued to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover. Throughout their lawsuit, Thorson stated that Liberace referred to him in the media as a disgruntled employee, a liar, a gold digger, and claimed that there was never a sexual relationship between them. The case was settled out of court in 1986, with Thorson receiving a $75,000 cash settlement, plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000 (a total of $ today). Thorson visited and reconciled with Liberace shortly before the entertainer's death in February 1987. Thorson said, after Liberace had died, that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying, and that Thorson had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony. A year after Liberace's death, Thorson published a book about their relationship, Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace. In the Canada‚ÄìUS television film Liberace: Behind the Music (1988), Thorson was portrayed by Michael Dolan. Thorson's book was later adapted by Richard LaGravenese and Steven Soderbergh into the 2013 film Behind the Candelabra, in which Thorson was played by Matt Damon opposite Michael Douglas as Liberace. The movie aired on HBO on May 26, 2013. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, with music by Academy Award-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch.  Other  In 1989, Thorson emerged as a pivotal witness in the prosecution of gangster Eddie Nash, in the 1981 quadruple murders of the Wonderland Gang. For his testimony, he was placed in the federal witness protection program. In 1990, he was shot five times when drug dealers broke into his hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2008, Thorson pleaded guilty to felony drug and burglary charges and was sentenced to four years in prison. Previously diagnosed with hepatitis C, in the autumn of 2012, Thorson was diagnosed with stage II cancer. After his diagnosis, and before his health care became the responsibility of the Nevada Department of Corrections in January 2014, Thorson made public pleas for money to continue his medical treatments. Thorson had planned in 2012 to re-release the book Behind the Candelabra to coincide with the film's release. In February 2013, police investigating a lost wallet tracked the use of the victim's credit cards to a hotel in Reno, Nevada. Thorson was found to be using the credit cards and was arrested. Thorson (who also uses the alias Jess Marlow, which he says that he acquired when he entered the protection program in the Nash case) was booked on a variety of charges, including burglary and using a credit card without consent. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years' probation in July 2013. Thorson did not do well on probation. In September 2013, he tested positive for methamphetamine, but was given another chance. He subsequently failed drug tests again ‚Äî twice in October, and again on November 1, 2013. He was arrested on November 19, 2013, after violating a court order to enter an inpatient treatment facility in Reno two weeks earlier. On January 23, 2014, his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to 8 to 20 years in Nevada prison. Thorson was incarcerated in Northern Nevada Correctional Center, in Carson City,, and is currently completing his term in unsupervised custody in residential confinement, with a scheduled release date of September 3, 2022. Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlite BunnyRanch, paid Thorson's $125,000 bail in 2013.

Muirhead commissioned the leading Melbourne architects Webb and Taylor to undertake the work.Heritage Council of Victoria website Online reference He lived at the house until his death in 1862, with the house being sold the following year after the death of his wife. The house was leased for a number of years, but was finally sold by Muirhead's executors to James Francis Maguire in 1878. Located on Swinburne Street, on the original 1888 subdivision plan of St Helen's estate it is named Maguire Street. In 1900 the State Government of Victoria purchased the house as a country residence for the Governor of Victoria, although it was never used as such. The Geelong Harbour Trust purchased the house in 1905 for 6000 pounds. A dining room and seven bedrooms were added in 1910, the Trust using Osborne House as a guest house for a number of years. The Trust offered the house to the Royal Australian Navy in 1911, but the proposal was not accepted at that time. In 1913 the Navy took up offer to use the house as an officer training college. Improvements to the buildings were carried out, including the erection of a block of buildings as quarters for unmarried seamen, two new classrooms, and alterations to the main room to provide a large barrack for 28 cadets. The college was opened by the Governor General, Lord Thomas Denman on March 1, 1913, with Prime Minister Andrew Fisher also present. Lord Denman arrived by torpedo boat, and 200 invited guests arrived by train from Melbourne. The college housed 28 cadets, four petty officers, and 10 seamen, together with the instructors and domestics. The initial class of 28 cadets was chosen from 137 candidates.

In 1939 the Department of Defence took over the premises to use as an army training centre. In 1945 the Shire of Corio regained control of Osborne House to use as its offices.

The title is honorary and has no responsibilities and no privileges. All Finnish titles are non-hereditary. The only title of equal rank is valtioneuvos.  Origin and history  The vuorineuvos title originated in late 18th-century Sweden when mining played a major role in the economy, including in Swedish-held Finland. During that era five Finns were awarded the title. From 1809 to 1917 in the semi-autonomous, Russian-ruled Grand Duchy of Finland a further 19 titles were awarded. The first recipient of the vuorineuvos title in the modern free state of Finland was Baron Fridolf Hisinger, on 17 July 1918. Awarding of the title has evolved to include not only giants of the mining industry but distinguished leaders in other industries and commerce. By 2010, the title had been granted to 295 people. Honorees are usually chief executive officers or chairmen of the board of major corporations. As of 2007, the title had been held by only one woman, , the principal owner and CEO of Turun Sanomat corporation.  High taxation of the title  The persons proposing that the honorary vuorineuvos title be conferred on someone are required to pay to the Finnish government a stamp duty. (48,400 euros in 2007). The kauppaneuvos title dating back to the same era, by comparison, is taxed at the rate of 33,300 euros.  Rejection of the title by notable would-be honorees  Antti Ahlstr√∂m, the founder of Ahlstrom; Jorma Ollila, the former CEO of Nokia; and Pekka Herlin of KONE have refused the title out of personal preference.  Translation advisory from the translation service of the Finnish prime minister's office  According to the translation service of the Finnish prime minister's office, there is no official or established English translation for the vuorineuvos title. If it cannot be left out, the prime minister's office advises it best be used untranslated as \\"the Finnish honorary title of vuorineuvos\\". In cases in which translators are not able to convince their customers that it is best left out or at least untranslated, the prime minister's office further directs, customers can usually be persuaded to accept the paraphrase \\"the highly respected industrialist X\\". Otherwise, a possible translation that does not ridicule the title holder would be \\"senior industrialist X\\", but this still conveys a very incorrect picture of Finnish society. \\"X, senior industrialist\\" would be a bit better.

History Establishment Cubana was established on 8 October 1929 as Compa√±√≠a Nacional Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Curtiss, indicating its association with the Curtiss aircraft manufacturing company. It was one of the earliest airlines to emerge in Latin America. Cubana's predecessors were the Compa√±√≠a A√©rea de Cuba, founded in 1919, and the Compa√±√≠a A√©rea Cubana, founded in 1920 (both airlines flew out of Havana's Columbia Airport, which started operations in 1919). Those companies were dissolved soon after they started, however, due to the difficult economic conditions affecting Cuba (and many other nations) in the aftermath of World War I. Other air transport companies in Cuba at the time of Cubana's founding were Servicio Cubano de Aviaci√≥n, L√≠neas A√©reas de Cuba, and Compa√±√≠a Nacional Cubana de Transporte A√©reo. All of these companies existed only for short periods of time, and had limited finances. They mostly operated occasional flights that carried packages for urgent delivery, or individuals who sought air travel for private business trips or recreational purposes. They were all greatly affected by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 and the early 1930s, and the subsequent drop in air traffic. Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Curtiss started services in 1930 with Curtiss Robin aircraft, followed by Sikorsky S-38 amphibians and Ford Trimotors. Amphibious service linked the coastal mining areas in the eastern part of Cuba, while the land- based Curtiss Robins and Ford Trimotors served the major provincial cities. The Curtiss Aviation School, owned by the Curtiss airplane manufacturing company, had trained Cuban pilots starting in the 1910s, thus creating the expertise necessary for the emergence of Cubana. Among the early Cuban aviation aces was Agust√≠n Parl√°, a 1912 graduate of the Curtiss School, who had headed the Compa√±√≠a A√©rea de Cuba in 1919. Early years Visits to Cuba by famous aviators, and news about their exploits, favored Cubana's start-up. They generated interest in aviation and its commercial possibilities in Cuba, at a time when civil aviation was mostly a recreational activity. Among them were the Spanish-Cuban aviator Domingo Rosillo, who completed the first flight across the Strait of Florida (Key West to Havana) in 1913, French aviator Charles Nungesser in 1924, and the American Charles Lindbergh in his \\"Spirit of St. Louis\\" airplane in 1928. After Cubana's founding, the Spanish aviators Mariano Barber√°n and Joaqu√≠n Collar completed the first transatlantic flight from Spain to Cuba in 1933, followed in 1936 by the first Cuba-to-Spain (Havana-Seville) flight by Cuban aviator Antonio Men√©ndez Pel√°ez in an open cockpit, single-engine airplane. These and other feats promoted interest in long-distance flight. Pan American Airways (then known as Pan American Airways System or PAA) acquired Cubana in 1932, and the word Curtiss was deleted from the airline's name. Financial difficulties in the U.S.-based Curtiss aircraft manufacturing company, due to the deepening economic depression, partly motivated the sale. Cubana therefore became a subsidiary of Pan American Airways. At that time, Pan American had started to assemble a Latin American and Caribbean network, linking together air services in various nations with its own international routes in the Americas and the Caribbean. Pan American's own first-ever international scheduled service had started from Florida to Cuba in the 1920s (Key West-Havana). Acquiring Cubana therefore made sense to PAA's management as it expanded operations beyond Cuba toward the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba's populist revolution of 1933 had little effect on Cubana and on Pan American's ownership of the airline. Despite the nationalist character of the new government which seized power from 1933 until 1940, Pan American's investment in Cubana was safeguarded. The economic depression of the 1930s did affect Cuba, but its impact on Cubana was not substantial. At the time, much of Cubana's revenue was derived from carrying mail for Cuba's postal service. Airline passenger traffic was very limited, due to the small capacity of aircraft in those times. Also, people who chose to travel by air were mostly a select elite. Air travellers within Cuba in the 1930s were mostly wealthy business people, well-paid professionals, or well- to-do individuals who could afford the relatively high fares. Twin-engine Lockheed Model 10 Electras joined Cubana's fleet in 1934, allowing the airline to extend its routes within Cuba. These aircraft, which were among the most advanced in their time, were part of Pan American's investment in Cubana. The Lockheed Electras allowed Cubana to expand its land-based operations, serving cities which previously had no access to scheduled airline service. The expansion of Cubana's routes was accompanied by the creation of Cuba's Civil Aviation School in 1936, headed by Cuban aviation ace Ramiro Leonard. The school trained many aviators who would join Cubana's operations. By 1940, Cubana's fleet had a total of 12 aircraft, all of which were used in the airline's growing domestic network. The Lockheed Electras were followed by the Douglas DC-3 in 1944 and the Curtiss C-46 in 1946. As a subsidiary of Pan American Airways, Cubana's technical operations, aircraft livery, crews' uniforms and even the airline's logo closely followed those of Pan American (the PAA-style logo was retained until 1957). Cubana's route system within Cuba fed passengers to Pan American's international flights, providing connections through Havana. This relationship was similar to that of other Pan American Airways subsidiaries in Latin America, such as Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n and Panair do Brasil. In 1944 the name of the airline was changed to Compa√±√≠a Cubana de Aviaci√≥n S.A. A majority share in the airline was then sold to Cuban investors in that year, with Pan American Airways retaining a 42% stake. Pan American had been expanding rapidly, acquiring or setting up subsidiaries throughout Latin America (and re-establishing its Pacific and North Atlantic services as the end of World War II approached), and needed to raise capital. This change in majority ownership marked Cubana's ascendance as a Cuban enterprise, and made the airline a source of national pride. From 1944, Cubana would remain a private enterprise supported primarily by domestic capital. In 1944, the first International Conference on Civil Aviation was convened, which later would lead to the creation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Cuba was a participant in this conference and a founding member of ICAO, helping set the framework for international agreements that would rule civil aviation during the second half of the 20th century. In April 1945, the conference that created the International Air Transport Association (IATA) was held in Havana. Cubana became a founding member of IATA, and participated in the creation of that organization through its involvement with the Havana conference and the resulting accords. Both conferences and the organizations they spawned helped establish Cubana as an internationally recognized airline company. During its first 16 years Cubana's scheduled services were exclusively domestic. Its route system used Havana as its main hub, with frequent flights to the nation's major provincial cities. Cubana's founding in 1929 had coincided with the opening of Havana's Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport, allowing the airline to establish a permanent operational base there. Located 18 km. from central Havana, near the town of Rancho Boyeros, the new airport provided ample space for expansion (compared to Havana's old Columbia Airport, which was hemmed by the city's rapid growth). During the 1930s, Cubana expanded its services to serve most every major city in Cuba. Then, the Second World War stymied Cubana's expansion, due to limited supplies of fuel and aircraft. By the end of the War, however, Cubana was ready to launch its first international route. International expansion In May 1945 Cubana started its first scheduled international flights, from Havana to Miami using Douglas DC-3 aircraft. Cubana was the first Latin American airline to establish scheduled passenger services to Miami. Flights on this route carried mostly business people and tourists, and they helped start tourism travel as an important market for commercial aviation. The Miami route, because of its economic and political significance, would later prove to be an important part of Cubana's history. In April 1948 a transatlantic route was started between Havana and Madrid (via Bermuda, the Azores and Lisbon) using Douglas DC-4 aircraft. The DC-4 was Cubana's first four-engine aircraft, and it required five cockpit crew members to operate (captain, first officer, flight engineer, navigator and radio operator). The DC-4 that started the transatlantic route had a pressurized cabin and was christened \\"Estrella de Cuba\\" (CU-T188). A second DC-4 was christened \\"Estrella de Oriente\\" (CU-T397) and replaced the DC-3s on Cubana's Miami route. The Madrid route was extended to Rome in 1950 (the Madrid-Rome segment was later discontinued). The new route to Europe made Cubana one of the earliest Latin American carriers to establish scheduled transatlantic service.The first Latin American carrier to establish scheduled transatlantic service was Aerov√≠as Cuba Internacional, starting 24 November 1946 with a DC-4 aircraft, \\"Ruta de Col√≥n\\" (registered as N44567). This airline, however, ceased operations soon after, due to financial difficulties and a fatal accident on the Havana-Madrid route (involving the crash of the DC-4 \\"Ruta de Col√≥n\\" in Spain, on 6 February 1947). Cuba A√©reo, Breve Historia de la Aviaci√≥n Cubana, http://www.cubaaereo.com/pilot.asp?pg=historia . At the time, most European airlines did not have any transatlantic routes, and Cubana became the only carrier offering direct service from continental Europe to the Caribbean. Later, in the early 1950s, the DC-4s were replaced by Lockheed Constellations (L-049), the main type of aircraft used at the time for long- distance commercial air travel.The Lockheed Constellations (L-049) were provided by Pan American Airways after the loss of two of Cubana's DC-4s. On 25 April 1951 the \\"Estrella de Cuba\\" collided with a U.S. Navy aircraft in mid-air, on a flight from Miami to Havana, after Key West air traffic controllers provided erroneous instructions to the Navy plane; the \\"Estrella de Oriente\\" crashed shortly after takeoff from Bermuda on 6 December 1952, on a Madrid-Havana flight, due to apparent engine failure. George G√≥mez Fari√±as, \\"Una tragedia cubana, 40 a√±os despu√©s\\", El Nuevo Herald (December 15, 1992), p. 1C; Cuba A√©reo, Breve Historia de la Aviaci√≥n Cubana, http://www.cubaaereo.com/pilot.asp?pg=historia . Cubana Super Constellation L-1049E in flight, 1953 In the early 1950s the airline purchased several Lockheed Super Constellations (L-1049E and L-1049G) from the U.S., and turboprop Vickers Viscount (VV-755) aircraft from Britain to renovate its fleet. The first Super Constellation (L-1049E, registered as CU-P573) was delivered in early 1953, and was placed in service on Cubana's Madrid route. Cubana was Lockheed's launch customer for the L-1049E. The Super Constellations allowed Cubana to start service to Mexico City, New York City, and to increase frequencies to Madrid via Bermuda, the Azores and Lisbon. With these aircraft, Cubana became the first Latin American airline to establish services to New York. The Viscounts were used for its Miami and Nassau flights, and for domestic services to Camag√ºey and Santiago de Cuba. Cubana's turboprop Viscount flights to Miami from Havana and Varadero became popular with travellers, because of their shorter flight time, quieter ride, and superb onboard service. Cubana usually operated as many as five daily roundtrip Viscount flights between Havana and Miami year-round, with additional flights during holiday periods. The Miami route therefore became Cubana's main international source of revenue during the 1950s. In 1954, the airline became fully Cuban-owned when Pan American Airways sold its minority stake. This marked Cubana's independence as a private Cuban enterprise. Cuban investors were drawn to Cubana by the airline's potential for growth and by its achievements, such as the quality of passenger services, the renovation of its fleet (which was among the most advanced in Latin America), the experience of its crews, and its projected international expansion. An additional attraction were the airline's promotional efforts to cater to Cuba's growing tourism industry, particularly with American travellers. Tourism was a nascent industry in the 1950s. Havana, having one of the best hotel and communication infrastructures in Latin America, became a tourist playground, attracting more tourism than any other Latin American city in the mid-1950s. The city's proximity to the U.S. provided a formidable advantage that helped consolidate its position as a prime tourist destination. Cubana took advantage of Havana's excellent tourist infrastructure and amenities by pioneering the combination of flights, hotels and tours as a package. An example of this strategy was the airline's \\"Tropicana flights\\" from Miami, which combined flights, hotel, ground transport, and admission to the internationally famous Tropicana Cabaret in Havana. By the mid-1950s, Cubana was the Latin American carrier with most experience in travel promotion. Promotions At a time when airline in-flight publications were practically unknown, Cubana started its own in-flight magazine, Aerogu√≠a Cubana. The magazine was first published in March 1954. Typically about 60 pages long, with numerous photographs and illustrations, it was published in Spanish and contained articles on Cuba's tourist attractions, Cuban culture and folklore, the Cuban economy, Havana entertainment, points of interest in Cuba's provinces, a directory of Havana museums, hotels, restaurants, night clubs, and a calendar of upcoming monthly cultural and sports events, among other features. Aerogu√≠a Cubana was financially supported through advertisements from major, well-known Cuban private enterprises, such as the Bacardi liquor company, major Havana hotels, the department store El Encanto, and internationally well-known entertainment venues, such as the Tropicana and Montmartre cabarets (both in Havana). Issues of the magazine also often included articles on the airline's international destinations, such as a history of Miami (in the November 1954 issue), along with a humor-comics section and cross-word puzzles. Aerogu√≠a Cubana was distributed freely in all of the airline's international services, and in its domestic flights. In 1957, Cubana started a second publication, the Cubana Courier, a bilingual monthly newspaper. This publication was oriented toward travel agents and the tourism promotion industry, particularly in the U.S. Cubana Courier's reporting covered a wide range of subjects related to tourism in Cuba and the Cuban economy, among them articles covering Cuban tourism statistics, the Cuban construction industry, Havana's infrastructure, new tourism programmes, and foreign investment in Cuba. The newspaper also sometimes included educational supplements, such as a booklet explaining the workings of the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines which powered Cubana's Vickers Viscount aircraft. Cubana Courier was made available at the airline's international and domestic offices, and was distributed by mail to travel professionals in the U.S., Cuba, and other nations. This newspaper reflected Cubana's growing experience with tourism promotion. To many of the airline's investors, it was a welcome indication of Cubana's pioneering efforts in tourism promotion, and its growing expertise in mass communications related to tourism and travel. Luggage label showing Cubana's new logo, 1957 (the globe was slightly modified in the mid-1960s to show Asia, and all of South America, Africa and Europe) Cubana's travel promotion strategies also enlisted consultants and publicists with wide access to the media. Contracts with American advertising and public relations firms allowed the airline to become well known in the U.S. At the same time, Cuban advertising firms helped promote Cubana's domestic and international services. The airline thus became not only well known among American travellers, but was also a favorite of Cuba's growing middle classes as vacation and business travel abroad increased, due to the nation's economic expansion throughout the 1950s. The PAA-style logo Cubana had used since the 1930s was replaced in 1957, and a new logo and livery compatible with the advent of the jet age were adopted (the new livery and logo were retained until the late 1960s). The new logo's aerodynamic look included an oval-shaped globe showing the geographical areas served by Cubana, with Cuba in the center. It was unique among Latin American airlines, whose logos typically depicted avian-based designs or simply used their acronyms. At this time, Cubana also undertook a renovation of its fleet, opting to replace its long-range piston-prop Super Constellations with turboprop aircraft, and to expand its existing Vickers Viscount turboprop fleet in the immediate future. Turboprop expansion Cubana Bristol Britannia Model 318, 1958 (displaying the new logo on the tail and new livery) Cubana placed orders for four long-range Bristol Britannia (Model 318) and four Vickers Super Viscount (VV-818) aircraft, all turboprops, for its international services (which included Madrid, New York, Mexico City, Miami, Montego Bay, Nassau, Port-au-Prince), and for some of its domestic routes (Camag√ºey, Santiago de Cuba, Varadero). The first Bristol Britannia (CU-T668) was delivered in late 1958, and was placed in service in the airline's New York route. The new Britannias and Super Viscounts allowed Cubana to become the first Latin American airline to fly only turboprop aircraft in all its international routes. By the late 1950s, Cubana was the Latin American airline with most experience in the operation and maintenance of British-built turboprop aircraft. It also had one of the most advanced fleets in Latin America. The new Bristol Britannias and Super Viscounts provided the only turboprop flights to Cuba at a time when U.S.-flag carriers and all other airlines flew there only with piston-prop aircraft. Cubana's turboprop aircraft (starting with the Viscount VV-755s in the mid-1950s) shortened flight times significantly, and also provided a quieter ride than the piston- prop aircraft flown by all other carriers serving Cuba. Some of Cubana's turboprops started to set flight time records on the routes they flew. On 17 January 1959, for example, one of Cubana's new Britannias set a record for the New York-Havana route, flying it in 3 hours 28 minutes, the fastest ever for a commercial flight on that route. Similarly, on the Havana-Madrid route, Cubana's Britannias shortened total flight time by as much as 4 hours one-way, compared to the flight time of the Super Constellations (flown by a competing carrier). Cubana's Britannias thus allowed the airline to displace competing airlines on its New York, Mexico City and Madrid services, flying the routes faster, with less cabin noise and vibration, while providing excellent onboard service. Cubana's turboprop Viscounts and Super Viscounts on the Miami flights also flew the route faster than competing carriers, with excellent inflight service and amenities upon arrival in Havana. The Miami and New York routes thus became a major source of revenue for the airline. These routes were widely promoted in the U.S. through New York-based advertising agencies, that helped create an image of excellent service and reliability for the airline among American travellers. In 1958, Cubana placed an order for two Boeing 707-139 jets, becoming one of the first Latin American carriers planning to purchase this new passenger jet (the order was cancelled in 1960, when U.S.-Cuba relations deteriorated). Despite Cubana's advances during the 1950s and its position at the forefront of aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean, part of the year 1958 involved some difficulties for the airline. Cuba's intensifying revolutionary struggle impacted Cubana as three of its flights were hijacked. Two of the three hijackings did not result in losses, but one involved fatalities and the loss of an aircraft (a Viscount VV-755). This was the first-ever loss of life or an aircraft due to hijacking in Cubana's history. Revolutionary leaders subsequently apologized for the losses, but the incidents made it clear that Cubana's operations would no longer remain unaffected by the strife. Then, less than two months after the third hijacking incident, revolutionary leaders seized power (in January 1959), and another stage in the history of Cubana de Aviaci√≥n began. Revolution and socialism When Cuba's populist revolutionary movement, led by Fidel Castro, overthrew Fulgencio Batista's regime in January 1959, Cubana was seen by the new government as an important resource. Building up the new government's foreign relations became an important priority, and Cubana had a major role to play in this area. Despite the fact that the airline was a private enterprise, it was viewed by the new government as Cuba's official air carrier. The events surrounding Cuba's revolutionary process in 1959 and 1960 attracted much international interest. Numerous international celebrities visited Cuba aboard Cubana's flights, providing much publicity to the airline. Among them were French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and writer Simone de Beauvoir, the American singer Josephine Baker, Chilean poet (and later Nobel laureate) Pablo Neruda, British historian Hugh Thomas, Soviet filmmaker Mikhail Kalatozov, and Colombian writer (and later Nobel laureate) Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. For these and many other celebrities who visited Cuba, often as guests of the new government, Cubana was the preferred airline. In May 1959 the revolutionary government decided to nationalise Cubana. The private passenger airline Aerov√≠as Q and private cargo carriers Cuba Aeropostal and Expreso A√©reo Interamericano were then merged into Cubana. At that time, Aerov√≠as Q operated Douglas DC-4 and Curtiss C-46 aircraft (modified for passenger use), while Cuba Aeropostal and Expreso A√©reo Interamericano used Douglas DC-3 and Curtiss C-46 freighters. Aerov√≠as Q had many daily flights from Havana's Columbia Airport (at the time a mixed use military-civilian airport adjacent to the Miramar district) to Key West, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Cuba's Isle of Pines (renamed Isla de la Juventud since the mid-1960s), but its operations were moved to Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport shortly before the merger. Cuba Aeropostal had frequent cargo flights to Miami and within Cuba, while Expreso A√©reo Interamericano operated cargo flights to Central America and the Caribbean. Shortly before the merger, Havana's Columbia Airport (which was part of the Camp Columbia military base) began to be used solely for military traffic and was renamed Ciudad Libertad. All commercial aircraft traffic for Havana was therefore concentrated at the Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport, located in the adjacent district of Rancho Boyeros (18 km. from central Havana). The merger of these airlines with Cubana consolidated Cuban commercial aviation under government ownership. Cubana's name was changed to Empresa Consolidada Cubana de Aviaci√≥n S.A., to reflect its new ownership and the mergers. The airline's expropriated investors, however, would soon launch a troublesome campaign against the airline. Most of Cubana's expropriated investors went into exile and sought external litigation against Cubana and against Cuba's revolutionary government. In the U.S., in particular, they joined with American investors whose properties had also been nationalised, in rejecting the new government's offer of 20-year 4.5% government bonds as compensation; a rate higher than the one paid for airline bonds in U.S. markets at that time. They instead demanded immediate payment and sought U.S. court orders to impound Cubana's aircraft. Those orders were issued at various times, starting in 1960. Such actions disrupted Cubana's U.S. operations considerably, leading to occasional flight delays or cancellations. The nationalisation of Cubana was among the first wave of business and property nationalisations enacted by Cuba's revolutionary government, as it sought greater control over the economy and the public ownership of key enterprises. As a nationalised company and Cuba's undisputed flag carrier, Cubana became an important resource in the revolutionary government's foreign relations strategy. Domestic and international travel by the government's leaders, and visits by official guests, were coordinated through the airline. Special flights for government officials and guests were operated frequently, as the airline became an essential element of Cuba's foreign policy. Important projects, such as the creation of the Cuban government's international press agency, Prensa Latina, in 1959 used Cubana for all travel arrangements. Cubana's international offices also became closely linked with Cuba's diplomatic legations. During 1960 many of the Cubana's most experienced crews and technicians sought employment with foreign airlines and left Cuba, reducing the airline's pool of skilled personnel. Then, by late 1960 Cubana was forced to discontinue all its U.S. routes, which included Miami and New York, along with the merged Aerov√≠as Q and Cuba Aeropostal services to Florida (Key West, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach). Rising tensions between the U.S. and Cuban governments, threats by the U.S. to impound Cubana aircraft, and the unilateral breaking of diplomatic relations by the U.S. government in January 1961, caused the cancellation of the routes. Earlier, in October 1960, the U.S. government had imposed a partial embargo on Cuba, in retaliation for the nationalisation of American properties.Central Intelligence Agency, Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation, Vol. III: Evolution of CIA's Anti-Castro Policies, 1959 ‚Äì January 1961 (declassified July 25, 2011). These actions were part of a broader U.S. strategy that had started as early as October 1959, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and State Department-proposed programme to support opposition groups inside Cuba, and allow occasional air and sea-borne raids from U.S. territory.National Security Archive, Bay of Pigs 40 Years After: Chronology, http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html, retrieved June 29, 2012. This initial programme then led to the March 1960 approval of a formal CIA plan to execute sabotage, assassinations, and to attack and invade Cuba with the objective of overthrowing its revolutionary government.Central Intelligence Agency, Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation, Volume I: Air Operations, March 1960 ‚Äì April 1961 and Volume II: Participation in the Conduct of Foreign Policy, compiled by Jack B. Pfeiffer (declassified July 25, 2011); Peter Wyden, Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1979), pp.7‚Äì64; Sen. Frank Church, U.S. Senate Select Committee, Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, Senate Report 94-465, November 20, 1975 (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1975); Central Intelligence Agency, Memorandum for the Director: Is Time on Our Side in Cuba?, January 27, 1961, by Sherman Kent, Chairman, National Board of Estimates (declassified May 26, 1976). This broad strategy of aggression and sabotage culminated in the failed, CIA-planned and executed April 1961 invasion of Cuba at Playa Gir√≥n (also known as the Bay of Pigs). When an aerial bombardment of several Cuban airports by CIA-piloted and owned U.S. B-26 bombers (using fake Cuban air force livery to confound defenders) occurred on 15 April 1961, Cubana was forced to discontinue all its operations.Karl Meyer and Tad Szulc, The Cuban Invasion (New York: Praeger, 1962); Johnson Haynes, The Bay of Pigs (New York: Norton, 1964); Eduardo Ferrer, Operaci√≥n Puma (Miami: International Aviation Consultants, Inc., 1975); Mimi Whitefield, \\"CIA Declassifies More Bay of Pigs Documents\\", Miami Herald (August 15, 2011), http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/08/15/2360831/cia- declassifies-more-bay-of-pigs.html. One of Cubana's Douglas DC-3 aircraft, registered CU-T138, that was parked at Santiago de Cuba's Antonio Maceo Airport, was destroyed in one of the CIA's aerial bombing raids on that day. Other Cubana aircraft were also damaged by the bombing raids. The aerial bombardments were a prelude to the invasion landings that occurred on 17 April. After the failure of the invasion and all related military actions, the U.S. government continued and increased its strategy of sabotage, assassinations and threats against Cuba's revolutionary government and the Cuban economy. Cubana, being a most visible entity of Cuba's foreign relations, thus came under special pressure from U.S. authorities. One way to put pressure on Cubana was to induce aircraft hijackings. The U.S. government thus crafted policies toward Cuba that led to frequent aircraft hijackings.John Elliston, editor, Psywar on Cuba (New York: Ocean Press, 1999); Don Bohning, The Castro Obsession (Washington: Potomac Books, 2005). Starting in 1961, the U.S. automatically granted asylum to any hijackers of Cubana (and any other Cuba-registered) aircraft, regardless of any crimes committed in Cuba by the hijackers, or any deaths and injuries that resulted from a hijacking. This policy provided a formidable incentive for anyone to undertake an aircraft hijacking, since all hijackers were assured of complete immunity (and impunity) once they reached the U.S.National Security Archive, Index of Declassified Cuban Documents, Part (6) \\"The Politics of Aggression Against Cuba After Gir√≥n\\", http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/cuba.html; John Elliston, editor, Psywar on Cuba (New York: Ocean Press, 1999). This policy caused additional problems for Cubana, beyond hijacking incidents, since hijacked aircraft were usually retained by the U.S. for periods of time, to cause a loss of the aircraft's use to the airline and to entice crews to remain in the U.S. As a result, Cubana was forced to adopt heightened security precautions in all its flights, training pilots and crew members, as well as ground personnel, to prepare for hijacking incidents. The airline was also forced to expand its fleet with reserve aircraft, to be placed in service when a hijacked aircraft was retained by the U.S. Bristol Britannia BB-318 of Empresa Consolidada Cubana de Aviaci√≥n S.A. arriving at Shannon Airport (Ireland), 1962 (en route from Prague) Despite these problems, in late 1961 Cubana expanded its scheduled transatlantic services to Prague (in addition to its existing Madrid route) using its Bristol Britannia turboprops. This was the first scheduled service by a Latin American airline to Eastern Europe. The new Prague route made a scheduled refueling stop in Gander (Canada) before reaching Prague [stopping also in Shannon (Ireland) on the return flight]. Cubana then ceded one of its Britannias to Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) (CU-T668, re-registered as OK-MBA by CSA) so that it could start its own Prague-Havana flights, in cooperation with Cubana's services on that route. Cubana's crews trained CSA personnel in the operation of the Britannias. This allowed CSA to establish its first-ever scheduled transatlantic service in early 1962. The Gander and Shannon stops on Cubana's Prague route (Gander only on the Madrid route) became necessary after the U.S. government pressured and got Cubana's landing rights cancelled in Bermuda and the Azores in 1961. These stops were essential (Bermuda on the outbound and Azores on inbound flights) because Cubana's Britannias did not have the necessary range to fly nonstop to and from Europe. The Bermuda and Azores stops had been part of Cubana's transatlantic routes since 1948, when its first flights to Europe started. Fortunately for Cubana, the Canadian and Irish governments provided landing rights and refused to bend to U.S. pressure, especially when Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) started to operate its own services on the same route (coordinated with Cubana's). The denial of those rights by Canada and Ireland would have forced Cubana to discontinue its transatlantic routes. The Gander stop, in particular, posed many challenges to Cubana's crews over the years because of very difficult winter conditions, which included snow and ice storms, icy runways, temperatures below ‚àí30 ¬∞C, and diverted flights with low fuel reserves. Also, U.S. government policies toward Cuba enticed Cubana's crews to desert their flights at Gander and emigrate to the U.S. Despite these difficulties, Cubana never experienced an accident on the Gander route during its four decades of operation. With the U.S. breaking relations (in January 1961) and the imposition of a total U.S. embargo on Cuba on 7 February 1962 (beyond the partial one imposed in October 1960), Cubana turned to the Soviet Union to obtain new aircraft. Although the Bristol Britannias were kept in service for many years, the airline's Viscounts (VV-755) and Super Viscounts (VV-818) were sold in 1961 and 1962 to other carriers (Cunard Eagle, Trans- Australia, and South African Airways). The first Soviet-built aircraft type delivered was the twin-engine, piston-prop Ilyushin IL-14 in late 1961. Soon after, Ilyushin IL-18 four-engine turboprops were delivered, and began to be used in Cubana's domestic services. They were followed by the twin-engine Antonov AN-24 and AN-26, and the four-engine AN-12, all of them turboprops. The AN-26s and AN-12s, both freighters, helped sustain and expand Cubana's cargo operations on short- and long-range routes. These aircraft replaced all of Cubana's Viscounts, Super Viscounts and U.S.-built aircraft. Except for the Bristol Britannias, Cubana's fleet would now be made up of Soviet-built aircraft. U.S. government actions against Cubana continued all along, with pressures being placed on Western petrol companies that supplied the airline on its international routes. Bombings, arson and other sabotage of Cubana's offices in Mexico, Canada and Western Europe also occurred occasionally, beyond aircraft hijackings. Groups and individuals claiming responsibility (or suspected) for these violent actions were known or alleged to have had CIA training or ties. Then, the missile crisis of October 1962 had a negative impact on the airline, as all of Cubana's services had to be suspended during the crisis, due to the threat of U.S. aerial bombardments and the potential for Cubana aircraft to be destroyed by U.S. warplanes. The memory of what had happened 18 months earlier (April 1961), during the CIA's aerial bombardment of Cuba, and the destruction of Cubana aircraft, caused the airline to take additional precautions (beyond suspension of all services).Central Intelligence Agency, CIA Documents on the Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962, compiled by Mary Sperling McAuliffe (Washington: History Staff, CIA, 1992). Some aircraft were dispersed and parked at various airports, and those flying abroad at the time the crisis started were instructed not to return. Disruptions continued after the end of the October missile crisis, but Cubana's services were nonetheless fully restored, and were helped by the ongoing acquisition of Soviet-built aircraft. Cubana's new Soviet-built fleet was accompanied by important cooperation agreements with Eastern bloc airlines. Cooperation with CSA Czechoslovak Airlines had already produced mutually beneficial results. In 1963, Cubana's cooperation made it possible for Aeroflot Soviet Airlines to establish 18-hour nonstop scheduled services between Moscow and Havana. These were the longest nonstop flights in the world, and the Tupolev 114 aircraft Aeroflot used were also the largest passenger aircraft in service at that time. Cubana provided Aeroflot with ground support and technical services, and representative offices in Havana and Cuba, for the nonstop Moscow-Havana route. Aeroflot, in turn, represented Cubana in the USSR. Later, cooperation with the East German airline Interflug made it possible for this carrier to establish its first-ever scheduled transatlantic service, linking East Berlin with Havana. Cooperative agreements (without direct flights) were also established with Malev (Hungarian Airlines), LOT Polish Airlines, and Tarom (Romanian Air Transport). These and other cooperation agreements supported Cubana's technical capabilities and led to mutual accords involving representative offices, passenger services and aircraft maintenance. Later on, with the arrival of the Ilyushin IL-62 jets in the late 1960s, Cubana was able to replace its Britannias and start all-jet service to Europe on its already existing routes to Madrid and Prague (via Gander, Canada). A fleet of Tupolev TU-154, Ilyushin IL-76, Yakovlev YAK-40 and YAK-42 jets, and the more advanced Ilyushin IL-62M, followed in the 1970s for the airline's transatlantic, Latin American, Caribbean, and domestic services. The acquisition of this large and diverse fleet was financed by the Soviet Union and carried very favorable terms, such as repayment through general barter trade in place of hard currency. As a result, Cubana became the Latin American carrier with most experience in the operation of Soviet-built aircraft. The agreements with Eastern bloc airlines and nations also allowed Cubana to fulfill an important strategic role for the Cuban government. Since the early 1960s, numerous aspiring revolutionaries from Latin America travelled to Cuba for education, training, medical care and conferences. They usually travelled on Cubana's flights from Prague, and in some cases also used the airline's occasional special flights to Eastern bloc cities. This long roundabout became important when almost all Latin American nations severed relations with Cuba, mostly in response to U.S. pressures. By the mid-1960s, only Mexico had diplomatic relations with Cuba, and Cubana's Mexico City service provided the only flights to Latin America. The Mexico City flights were closely monitored by the CIA, however, making it difficult for individuals who travelled to Cuba to avoid being targeted (and potentially submitted to arrest, torture or death when they returned to their home countries). Through its transatlantic flights to Prague and other Eastern bloc cities, Cubana therefore helped fulfill a significant element of the Cuban government's foreign relations strategy. Later, throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, numerous African revolutionaries would also use Cubana's services from Eastern bloc nations, to travel to Cuba and avoid being targeted by the CIA and Western intelligence services (although the Gander stop, necessary because of the Britannias' and IL-62s' limited range, did pose some challenges). 1970s and 1980s In 1975, Cubana's Bristol Britannias were pressed into service to ferry elite Cuban military units to Angola, as part of Operation Carlota. The Britannias were modified (with additional fuel tanks placed inside the passenger cabins) by Cubana's technicians, to allow non-stop flights from Cuba to Africa (with a reduced passenger load). This occurred when the U.S. government started to pressure Barbados to cancel Cubana's landing rights for those flights. Modifications to the Britannias included providing access to the cargo bay from the passenger cabins, to facilitate the rapid deployment of weapons and ammunition upon arrival. Nobel Prize winning author Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez wrote articles in 1977 (and a book) that included narrations about Cubana's Britannias and its pilots flying the first contingent of elite Cuban troops to Angola.Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Operaci√≥n Carlota (Lima: Mosca Azul, 1977). The route for those very urgent flights often involved a brief stop at Brazzaville for refueling and information on developments in Luanda. Arrivals in Brazzaville and Luanda were scheduled for nighttime, and the aircraft's exterior and interior lights were turned off before landing, on the ground, and during takeoff to avoid attracting attention. The initial flights were undertaken in secrecy, and helped prevent apartheid South Africa's army from occupying Luanda when Angola gained independence. In all, Cubana's Britannias performed over 100 flights between Cuba and Angola during several months, as part of Operation Carlota. Because spare parts were no longer made or marketed, Cubana's technicians had to manufacture them, and brake parts from Ilyushin IL-18 aircraft were adapted to fit the Britannias.Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, \\"Operaci√≥n Carlota\\", Granma Internacional (November 3, 2005), http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2005/noviembre/juev3/45carlota.html, p. 10 [article orig. published in Tricontinental (Mexico), no. 53, 1977]. Maintenance time was reduced by half to keep the aircraft operating continuously, despite the lack of weather reports along the sparsely travelled route. Each flight carried two pilot crews, taking turns at the controls, but pilots often flew beyond their flight-time limits. Shortly after this operation, Cubana established scheduled services between Havana and Luanda. Cubana's Britannias served in the airline's fleet for over three decades (they were retired in 1990), and never experienced any accident. In the mid-1970s, Cubana leased Douglas DC-8-43 aircraft (previously in service with Air Canada) for its Canadian, Caribbean and Guyana services. These aircraft were leased with support from the Canadian government, as part of bilateral trade agreements between Canada and Cuba. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau had spearheaded this initiative himself, seeking to strengthen relations between Canada and Cuba. As a result, the Canadian government, and Mr. Trudeau himself, came under intense pressure from the U.S. government, which disapproved of this initiative and sought to stop it.Morley Morris, \\"The United States and the Global Blockade of Cuba: A Study in Political Pressures on American Allies\\", Canadian Journal of Political Science (March 1984), pp. 25‚Äì48. The DC-8 leases allowed Cubana to gain experience operating U.S.-built jets and made up for delays in deliveries of Soviet-built aircraft. One of the DC-8s (CU-T1200) was damaged in an accident (a mid-air collision with a smaller aircraft) during a test flight, with no loss of life, but a second DC-8 (CU-T1201) was lost when bombs exploded during an international flight in 1976, resulting in numerous fatalities.Barbados Commission of Enquiry, Aircraft Accident: Cubana de Aviaci√≥n, DC-8, CU-T1201, in the Sea Off the Coast of Barbados, October 6, 1976: Report of the Commission of Enquiry, parts I and II (Bridgetown: Commission of Enquiry, 1977). The explosions occurred shortly after takeoff from Barbados, whose government had been pressured earlier by the U.S. to cancel Cubana's landing rights.National Security Archive, \\"Bombing of Cuban Jetliner 30 Years Later\\", Electronic Briefing Book no. 202 (October 5, 2006), ed. by Peter Kornbluh and Ivette White, http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB202/index.htm. Among the many fatalities was a group of 24 athletes, mostly teenagers, from one of Cuba's sports teams. The Cuban government decried the explosions as sabotage, perpetrated by CIA-trained individuals who sought to damage the airline and terrorize passengers who would fly with Cubana.Fidel Castro, Speech by Prime Minister Fidel Castro Ruz Regarding October 6th Bombing of Cuban Jetliner (New York: Center for Cuban Studies, 1976) As a result, Cubana was forced to screen all passengers and luggage carefully before boarding, requiring lengthy advance check-in times and individual security checks as routine precautions in all flights. The leases for the DC-8s were terminated in the late 1970s, as a result of the losses. Except for the Britannias, the DC-8s were the only Western-built aircraft Cubana operated during the 1970s. In 1978 the Carter administration, despite the continuing U.S. embargo, decided to open a U.S. interests section in Havana, to aid family reunions and visits of U.S. residents to families in Cuba. The U.S. had unilaterally broken diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961, and there had been no direct U.S. diplomatic representation whatsoever in Havana since that time (Cuba had not been allowed to have any diplomatic representation in U.S. territory since then, except for its U.N. mission). Although not an embassy in the formal sense, this diplomatic initiative nonetheless allowed Cubana to operate regular charter flights between Havana and Miami. No regular flights between Cuba and the U.S. had been allowed by the U.S. government since the 1960s, and U.S. airlines had since been banned from serving Cuba by the embargo. Cubana's charter flights to Miami were abruptly cancelled, however, by the Reagan administration shortly after it took office in 1981.The Reagan administration imposed restrictions on family visits to Cuba and ended most other travel, terminating almost all flights between the U.S. and Cuba. Antonio R. de la Cova, \\"U.S. Cuba Relations During the Reagan Administration\\", in President Reagan and the World, ed. by Eric J. Schmertz, Natalie Datlof and Alexej Ugrinsky (London: Greenwood, 1997), pp. 381‚Äì391; Alfonso Chardy and Jay Ducassi, \\"U.S. Bans Most Travel to Cuba, But Family Visits Continue\\", Miami Herald (April 20, 1981), p. 1. Despite the Carter administration's initiative, provocations and sabotage against Cubana's operations continued all along, with actual and attempted bombings of Cubana's offices in Canada, Latin America and Europe (Cubana was not allowed to open any offices in the U.S. for the charter flights). Armed groups in the U.S., trained in sabotage and explosives, often issued public threats against Cubana.Among the groups, Omega 7 figured prominently. Its founder had been implicated as an alleged mastermind of the 1976 bombing of the Cubana aircraft in Barbados. Jeffrey Steinberg, \\"International Terrorism: Who's Running the Omega 7 Threat\\", Executive International Review, vol. 7, no. 39 (October 7, 1980), p. 49; Tom Fiedler, \\"Feds Watching 'Guerrilla Camps' of Exiles\\", Miami Herald (March 20, 1981), p. 32; Arthur Quintana and Jeff Benkoe, \\"FBI Finds Weapons Cache at Site of Omega 7 Arrest\\", Miami News (July 23, 1983), p. 1. U.S. travel agencies that arranged Cubana's charter flights were also targeted with bombings, arson and other sabotage. Such acts followed a pattern that started in 1960 and that targeted Cubana's offices in numerous nations, seeking to terrorize the airline's staff and passengers, and to obstruct its operations. The groups that claimed responsibility for those acts were led by individuals who had been CIA-trained or previously had ties to that intelligence agency.Agencia de Informaci√≥n Nacional, The CIA's War Against Cuba (Havana: Agencia de Informaci√≥n Nacional, 1988); Fabi√°n Escalante Font, The Cuba Project: CIA Covert Operations, 1959‚Äì62 (New York: Ocean Press, 2004). By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Cubana flew scheduled services to Eastern and Western Europe (Prague, East Berlin, Moscow, Madrid, Paris, Lisbon), Sub- Saharan Africa (Luanda, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde), Asia (Baghdad), North Africa (Tripoli), Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Gander), and to various Latin American and Caribbean destinations (Mexico City, Panama, Managua, Lima, Kingston, Barbados, Port of Spain, Georgetown). A route to Vietnam was under consideration at that time but was never started. The Baghdad route, in particular, made Cubana the first Latin American airline to serve Asia (this route was discontinued in the early 1980s). During the 1970s and 1980s, Cubana served as general representative in Cuba for various Western airlines, such as Swissair, Sabena, Lufthansa and TAP. Mostly, these were airlines that did not serve Cuba but needed representation due to increasing travel of citizens from their home countries to Cuba. In addition, Cubana represented several African carriers in Cuba, such as TAAG, LAM, TACV (Cabo Verde) and LIA (Guinea- Bissau). Cubana also continued to represent Aeroflot Soviet Airlines, CSA Czechoslovak Airlines, Interflug, Malev Hungarian Airlines, LOT Polish Airlines and TAROM Romanian Air Transport. In the early 1980s, Cubana ceded one of its IL-62 jets to Angola's national airline, TAAG, so that it could start its own scheduled flights on the Luanda-Havana route, in cooperation with Cubana's services on that route. This enabled TAAG to operate its first- ever transatlantic service. Some of Cubana's crews and technicians also helped TAAG sustain its services in Angola and Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In most cases, Cubana's crews had to operate multiple types of aircraft to sustain flights, using both Western- and Soviet-built airplanes. This helped Angola to keep its national airline operating when civil war started, as factions supported by the apartheid South African regime, the CIA, and Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko fought to gain control of the nation and its resources.John Stockwell, In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story (New York: Norton, 1978); John Marcum, The Angolan Revolution, vol. 2 (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1978). Most of the international services noted above were sustained through the decade of the 1980s. Cubana's international flights mostly carried diplomats, government officials, sports delegations, scholarship students, cultural exchange delegations, Cuban medical personnel on aid missions, military personnel, and visitors to official events in Cuba. Most international destinations were served once or twice per week. As the Cuban government began to make tourism a priority in the mid-1980s, however, Cubana's international flights started to cater more to this growing segment of travellers to Cuba. Then, the collapse of the Soviet bloc by the end of the 1980s, and the Soviet Union's own dissolution in 1991, would have a major impact on the airline's operations. Post-Cold War era With the collapse of the Eastern bloc, Cubana faced the formidable challenges of improving passenger services, revamping its technical capabilities, and restructuring its fleet. Any one of those challenges would have been a daunting undertaking for any major Western airline. Cubana had to face all of them at the same time, with great urgency, along with the continuing U.S. embargo on Cuba (which prohibited sales of U.S.-made aircraft and components). Despite the immense difficulties it faced, Cubana managed to sustain and expand its services throughout the 1990s. Cuba's rapidly growing tourism sector also helped the airline, providing much needed traffic. Cubana had received it last three completely new IL-62Ms in late 1990 (CU-T1282) and early 1991 (CU-T1283 and 1284), from the Kazan, USSR, factory that manufactured these aircraft.IL-62 Classic List, . Two other, also new, IL-62Ms had been delivered in 1988 and 1989. Cubana was therefore able to keep most of these aircraft in service long after the USSR's dissolution (in 1991) and the end of all IL-62M production in the mid-1990s. Its long experience with these aircraft made it possible to keep them flying, to sustain some of its long- and medium-range routes in the 1990s and beyond (Cubana's last IL-62M in regularly scheduled service was retired in 2011). The U.S. government's long-standing quest to damage Cubana continued in the 1990s, beyond the restrictions imposed by the embargo (in effect since 1962), by prohibiting all flights over U.S. territory, despite the fact that the airline was not allowed to serve the U.S. at all. The prohibition violated international commercial aviation accords. Many U.S. aircraft overflew Cuba every day, on flights between the U.S. and Latin America or the Caribbean, yet the Cuban government did not pursue any retaliation against U.S. carriers or aircraft. Cubana's affected routes were those between Cuba and Canada, which at the time carried a significant amount of tourist traffic. Cubana was therefore forced to take long and very costly detours on all flights between Canada (Montreal, Toronto) and Cuba, to avoid overflying the U.S. A complaint to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and an upgrade of aircraft flying the Canada routes with costly new communications equipment ended this blockage, despite the fact that most aircraft operating within the U.S. at that time were not required to have similar equipment (or had less advanced equipment than Cubana). This action by the U.S. government placed additional financial and technical strains on Cubana, at a time when the airline was in a very vulnerable situation, facing challenges that could have easily grounded any Western carrier. Efforts were made to improve operations in the mid-1990s by leasing Western-built aircraft. This helped the airline to compete for passengers in Western Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Western-built aircraft were leased for limited periods of time, to supplement Cubana's Soviet-built jets. Long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide-bodies were leased from the French airline Air Outre Mer (AOM) in the 1990s, and medium-range Airbus A320 aircraft from various companies, despite pressures by the U.S. government to rescind or prevent leases. The French airline AOM, in particular, was threatened by the U.S. with cancellation of landing rights, when it entered into its lease and code- sharing agreements with Cubana. An intervention by the French government was required to prevent AOM from being severely damaged by those threats and any resulting U.S. actions. These and other unilateral pressures were unprecedented in the history of commercial aviation, and they were part of the U.S. government's longstanding efforts to damage Cubana and the Cuban economy. In the mid-1990s, Cubana also acquired several Fokker F-27 turboprops from Iberia Airlines of Spain, as well as Sud Aviation ATR 42 turboprop aircraft to sustain its short-range routes. For some short-range routes in the Caribbean and within Cuba, the regional airline AeroCaribbean was enlisted to support Cubana's operations, offering connection and code-sharing services. Cubana also leased wide-body aircraft, such as Airbus A330 and Boeing 767, for limited periods of time from various European companies to support its transatlantic, North American and Latin American services, given Cuba's rapidly growing tourism sector. Cubana's most experienced crews were trained in the operation of all of these aircraft, and the airline also undertook their technical maintenance. With the introduction of the Web in the middle 1990s, Cubana faced a new and unexpected challenge from the U.S. Anonymous U.S.-based individuals and groups (often using multiple online pseudonyms, false identities, and claiming to have been Cubana passengers) started systematically and regularly flooding travel-related websites, online forums and blogs with negative comments and false statements about Cubana's services and aircraft.According to specialists at the Ministerio de la Inform√°tica y las Comunicaciones (MIC), Havana, 2000. Travel websites, forums and blogs based in numerous nations are usually targeted, especially those served by Cubana. Also, events that typically go unnoticed when they happen in U.S. airlines are falsely exaggerated and distorted sensationally in travel-related blogs and forums, when they occur in Cubana flights. When Cubana opened its own website, it was faced with denial-of-service attacks by U.S.-based hackers that frequently closed all access to the site. These and other frequent hacking attacks prevented Cubana from setting up online payment channels for reservations and ticketing, causing additional difficulties and losses for the airline.As reported by Internet analysts at the Universidad de las Ciencias Inform√°ticas (UCI) in 2005, and the Ministerio de la Inform√°tica y las Comunicaciones (MIC), Havana, in 2001. An additional, related problem in this area was the (still in effect) U.S. embargo's total prohibition of any payments to Cubana (and Cuba-based enterprises) with U.S.-based credit or debit cards, bank transfers (electronic or otherwise), and travellers' cheques, all of which greatly complicated setting up any online payment process for the airline. These U.S.-based efforts expanded the U.S. government's longstanding record of damaging the airline by multiple means, that had started with the cancellation of landing rights in the early 1960s, followed by the imposition of the U.S. embargo on Cuba (in 1962), along with many other actions and measures over the years. In the 1990s, using Western- built aircraft and also its Soviet-built fleet, Cubana established new routes to western Europe and Latin America, to cater to Cuba's rapidly growing tourism industry. Cubana's 1990s routes included regularly scheduled services to: *Europe: Geneva, London, Manchester, Rome, Milan, Copenhagen, Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin, Barcelona, Las Palmas, Vitoria, Santiago de Compostela. *South America: S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, Bogot√°, Caracas, Mendoza, C√≥rdoba, Quito, Guayaquil, Montevideo. *Central America: Guatemala City, San Jos√© de Costa Rica. *Caribbean: Santo Domingo, St. Maarten, Montego Bay, Fort de France, Nassau, Grand Cayman, Pointe a Pitre. *North America: Mexico City, Canc√∫n, Montreal, Toronto. In the 1990s Cubana also undertook many special flights involving humanitarian missions, despite all the operational difficulties it faced. For example, when in 1998 the hurricanes Georges and Mitch caused severe damage in Central America and the Caribbean, Cubana flew medical brigades and provisions to the affected nations. The airline also flew sports delegations from Cuba and other Caribbean nations to international competitions around the world. Cubana became the prime carrier for Cuba's medical missions, which operate in over 100 nations and are typically contracted by countries and governments with difficult health problems. Cubana's services are also important to diplomatic missions in Havana, which housed over 180 embassies and legations by the end of the 1990s (more than in any other Latin American capital). Cubana's strategic importance to Cuba's foreign relations and to its tourism industry was well understood by the Cuban government. As a result, considerable efforts were devoted to renovate the airline's fleet and its technical capabilities. Renovation After the 1990s, Cubana faced the need to replace its Soviet- built aircraft, to improve its competitiveness with other airlines serving Cuba. Its management therefore made plans to renovate the airline's fleet, and in late 2005 Cubana received its first new long-range Ilyushin IL-96-300 (CU-T1250) wide-body jet from Russia, to replace some of the leased Western- built wide-bodies and its Soviet-era aircraft. Other IL-96-300s were delivered later, making it possible for the airline to reduce its leased, long-range Western-built fleet. New medium-range Russian Tupolev TU-204-100E and 100EC jets (passenger and cargo versions) were also ordered and started to be delivered in 2007. The new IL-96 and TU-204 jets were financed with the assistance of the Russian government. Cubana refurbished some of its Ilyushin IL-62M aircraft in the early 2000s (decade), to continue using them in some of its international routes. The refurbished IL-62M aircraft were used in some of Cubana's flights within Latin America and for special flights to Africa. Restrictions imposed by the U.S. embargo on the sale of American-built aircraft and components (such as engines and avionics) also made it necessary for Cubana to keep the IL-62Ms in service, along with some Soviet-built aircraft in its domestic and short-range routes. Its newest IL-62M (CU-T1284) was received from the Ilyushin factory (in Kazan, USSR) in early 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union (two other new IL-62Ms were received in 1990). In all, Cubana had over four decades of experience with IL-62 and IL-62M aircraft, longer than any other airline in the world. Its IL-62s and IL-62Ms were also used for official government travel to many nations, including several round-the-world trips. Only one of Cubana's IL-62s (an IL-62M, CU-T1281) was ever lost in an accident, and this was due to a severe weather effect (wind-shear during take off, in 1989, long before this kind of weather problem attracted attention and remedial measures). All of Cubana's IL-62Ms were retired from regularly scheduled services in 2011. Cubana's long-term renovation strategy is based on the purchase of new Russian-built aircraft. An important factor seems to be the financing provided by the Russian government, which sees Latin America as a potentially promising market for some of the new-generation Russian aircraft. The efficiency and performance of the most modern Russian aircraft, such as the IL-96 and TU-204, compare favorably with aircraft built by Airbus and Boeing. Also, the performance, purchase price and maintenance requirements of new-generation Russian jet engines, such as the Pavel Soloviev/Aviadvigatel PS-90A, compare favorably with Western-built engines, such as those manufactured by Pratt and Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce. The much lower purchase price of Russian aircraft makes them attractive to government-owned airlines such as Cubana, and the airline's longstanding experience with Soviet and Russian- built aircraft is also a favorable factor. Cubana is, after all, the most experienced operator of Soviet- and Russian-built aircraft in the Americas. As part of its renovation strategy, Cubana sought to upgrade its technical support capabilities. The airline established a joint venture company with Iberia Airlines of Spain in 2004, to maintain and overhaul Western-built aircraft, including all Airbus and Boeing models. Technical facilities are located in Havana and other Cuban cities served by foreign carriers. The joint venture company, IBECA (incorporating Iberia's and Cubana's initials), is partly owned by Cubana. It has contracted with various airlines flying to Cuba to provide maintenance and technical support. Expertise gained through this venture are likely to help Cubana's technical capabilities with its new Russian aircraft, since they share many features with Western-built airplanes. In 2004, Cuba and China signed an aviation accord, thus opening the possibility for Cubana to eventually operate direct flights between Havana and Beijing or Shanghai. Those flights, when started, would most likely make an intermediate stop (possibly in Canada). The General Administration of Civil Aviation of China held talks with Cuban officials before the signing of the accord, and expressed the possibility that a Chinese carrier, such as Air China or China Eastern would start services to Cuba, in coordination with Cubana. Cuba has had long-standing cultural, commercial and diplomatic ties with China, that started in the mid-19th century with significant Chinese emigration to Cuba.Chinese-Cubans are the third most important racial group in Cuba. Immigration from China to Cuba started in 1847, and during 1853‚Äì1873 alone a total of 132,000 Chinese immigrants arrived in Cuba, according to official records. Armando Choy, Gustavo Chui and Mois√©s Sio Wong, Our History is Still Being Written: The Story of Three Chinese-Cuban Generals in the Cuban Revolution (New York: Pathfinder Press, 2005). The possibility of opening a route to China seems feasible for Cubana, given its experience with long-range flights and routes, the substantial commercial ties between Cuba and China, the long-standing cultural heritage of Chinese emigration to Cuba, and growing Chinese interest in the Caribbean and Latin America. During the August 2007 MAKS Airshow Cubana signed a $150 million contract for the purchase and confirmation of additional Tupolev TU-204s and new Antonov AN-148 aircraft.2007 MAKS Airshow - Cubana signed a $150 million for the delivery of additional TU-204s and AN-148s Th Antonov-148 purchase, in particular, will make Cubana one of this aircraft's launch customers. These new-generation Russian aircraft will allow Cubana to expand its services throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, and to upgrade its domestic routes. As Russian- built aircraft attract increasing interest from Latin America, Cubana stands to become an important source of technical support and demonstration for airlines that may lease or purchase them. Cubana's renovation efforts are also related to the airline's strategic importance for the Cuban government and its foreign relations. Cubana's aircraft are typically used by high-level Cuban government officials on trips abroad. Also, Cubana's pilots and technicians have typically served in the Cuban air force, and are experienced in the operation and maintenance of multiple types of aircraft. Most of Cubana's flight attendants have medical training or experience, making it possible to deal with health emergencies on board. In this respect, the airline benefits from Cuba's very large per capita number of medical doctors and health personnel (one of the highest in the world), and is able to market its services in the growing area of medical tourism. The large and increasing number of tourists who visit Cuba for medical treatment makes this a promising market for Cubana in the future. Cuba's growing tourism sector, the large number of tourist sites and their diverse attractions, also make it a very promising market for Cubana. Cuba's well-developed airport infrastructure, with 10 international airports capable of serving wide-body aircraft and long- range flights, makes it possible for Cubana to expand its international services to new destinations and markets. A major question for Cubana's future is the continuation of the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The embargo, imposed in February 1962 (a partial one started in October 1960), is the longest-running one in history and has been consistently and continuously condemned (annually) by the United Nations for several decades.Donna R. Koplowitz, Anatomy of a Failed Embargo: U.S. Sanctions Against Cuba (Boulder: Lynne Rienner, 1998). Cuba now receives millions of visitors every year and stands to become one of the most important tourist destinations in Latin America, despite the embargo's efforts to isolate it, and to damage Cubana and all other Cuba-based airlines. The embargo and other U.S. actions have done considerable damage to Cubana over the years, involving direct or indirect destruction of aircraft by U.S. aerial bombing raids, acts of sabotage, hijackings, bombings, arson, cancellations of landing rights, obstruction of services, freezing of financial assets, deaths of staff and passengers, and numerous other acts (by the U.S. government or by U.S.-based parties, or both). Most such acts have violated international laws and international commercial aviation agreements, as well as national sovereignty rights, and some can easily be classified as undeclared acts of war or of terrorism. Cubana clearly stands to seek much compensation from the U.S. when the embargo ends. The amounts to be sought, compounded over time, are likely to be quite substantial.

He is acknowledged as one of the foremost criminal solicitors in Scottish legal history. Early life and family Beltrami was born in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire on 15 May 1932. His father, Egidio Beltrami, was an Italian-Swiss man who had moved to Scotland to open a fish and chip shop, his mother Isabella was Scottish. Beltrami was brought up in Glasgow and educated at St. Aloysius' College. He graduated the University of Glasgow in 1953 having studied Law. He struggled to find an apprenticeship at a legal firm, possibly due to his Roman Catholic heritage, so after a period in the Intelligence Corps for his national service in the 1950s, he set up his own firm Beltrami & Co. Beltrami married nurse Brigid Delores Fallon on 14 January 1958 at St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow, and the couple would have three sons who would each go on to become lawyers. Edwin is the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, Adrian is a QC specialising in commercial litigation, and Jason is a lawyer in Glasgow. He died, aged 82 on 23 February 2015. Career Beltrami was involved in several high-profile cases, including the campaign for the release of Patrick Meehan. He defended such names as Johnny Ramensky, Colin Beattie and gained the first ever Royal Pardon issued in Scotland defending Maurice Swanson. Beltrami's most famous \\"client\\" was Hercules, a trained grizzly bear, who featured in Octopussy. The bear disappeared during filming of an Kleenex tissue advert on Benbecula, and was missing for over three weeks. His owner, Andy Robin, was prosecuted for failing to control a wild animal, but Beltrami successfully defended the man on the basis that Hercules was not wild as he was a \\"working bear\\". He successfully defended Glasgow crime figure Arthur Thompson on many occasions throughout the 1980s, leading to the phrase \\"get me Beltrami\\" being coined as a plea for help in desperate circumstances amongst Glaswegians during the time. Beltrami also successfully defended in 12 capital murder cases.

Disciplina arcani (Latin for \\"Discipline of the Secret\\" or \\"Discipline of the Arcane\\") is the custom that prevailed in the 4th and 5th centuries of Early Christianity, whereby knowledge of the more intimate doctrines of the Christian religion was carefully kept from non-Christians and even from those who were undergoing instruction in the faith so that they may progressively learn the teachings of the faith and not fall to heresy due to simplistic misunderstandings (hence, doctrines were kept from catechumens; Christian converts who had not yet been baptized). History In the second century, Christians freely communicated rites such as baptism and the Eucharist with pagan groups. Justin Martyr, for example, freely spoke with a pagan audience regarding the rite of the Eucharist. The disciplina arcani began to emerge in the 3rd century. Some have suggested Tertullian as the earliest witness to the practice, although recent scholars have noted Tertullian's belief that Christian teachings were public and should be taught in public. Later, in the middle of the 3rd century, Origen of Alexandria addressed the polemics against Christianity by the pagan Celsus in his Contra Celsum. Celsus accused Christianity of being a religion of secrecy like the Greco-Roman mysteries, and Origen replied that while the prominent doctrines of Christianity are well-known to the entire world, including the virgin birth, crucifixion, resurrection, punishment of the wicked and rewarding of the just, there are a few elements that must be retained within the group. Near the time of Origen, Hippolytus of Rome wrote at the end of his account of the rite of baptism; > If anything needs to be explained, let the bishop speak in private to those > who have received baptism. Those who are not Christians are not told unless > they first receive baptism. This is the white stone in which John spoke of; > \\"A new name is written on it which no one knows except him who receives the > stone. (Ap. Trad. 23:14) By the fourth century and first half of the fifth century, the practice of disciplina arcani had become universal and is attested in Rome (in the writings of Ambrose), Jerusalem (in the writings of Cyril and Egeria), Egypt, Constantinople, Cappadocia, North Africa, etc. There is evidence that Christians were careful to maintain specific articles of the religion, including removing members of the church who had not yet been baptized before the liturgical eucharist took place. Thus, the liturgy was divided into the Mass of the Faithful and Mass of the Catechumens. In Byzantine liturgy, the deacon often proclaimed, \\"The doors, the doors!\\" to signal that the doors must be watched to prevent unbaptized from participating in church activities. There may have been various reasons for maintaining secrecy of some things, including ensuring that outsiders did not attempt to use these rites to gain favours from God, or to shelter important rites from contempt. Furthermore, they also thought that one needed to experience the rite of baptism before learning about it so that teaching more efficient and successful.

In addition to opportunities to view wild eagles throughout the year from viewing decks, non-releasable bald eagles and golden eagles are on exhibit at the center as well as interactive exhibits on eagle science and history. History The site is located were hundreds of bald eagles congregate to scavenge and hunt fish year round due to a geographic anomaly at the confluence of the Mississippi and Chippewa Rivers. The Chippewa River's sedimentary deposits formed a delta creating Lake Pepin, a naturally occurring lake on the Mississippi formed by the backup of water. The fast running water exiting the Chippewa delta prevents ice from being able to form on the much of the Mississippi River in that area during the winter making it a good fishing ground for migrating eagles. In 1989, an informal group of local volunteers called Eagle Watch led by Mary Rivers partnered with the Wabasha Chamber of Commerce to develop an abandoned deck built for paddleboats to disembark passengers on the river for eagle enthusiasts coming to see bald eagles. In their first year of operation they tallied more than a thousand people who showed up in the middle of winter to look at bald eagles. In 1995, EagleWatch incorporated as a nonprofit and worked with the City of Wabasha which functioned as the fiscal agent for both State and Federal funds. The National Eagle Center received Federal recognition in 1998 which cleared the way for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies to assist in its development. The City of Wabasha later dropped its cooperative venture with EagleWatch to manage the Eagle Center, partnering instead with the National Audubon Society. In June 1999 the City of Wabasha contracted with the National Audubon Society to take over operations of the National Eagle Center from EagleWatch for eighteen months but later declined to renew the contract and \\"severed the ties\\" when it was discovered that most of the membership fees and donations raised were going to the support the National Audubon Society's State and National programs rather than to the National Eagle Center. The City was also alarmed over the National Audubon Society's decision to change the vision of the project substantially. The City of Wabasha then resumed its partnership with EagleWatch to take over the management of the National Eagle Center in July 2001. In 2000, under its then executive director Mary Beth Garrigan, the National Eagle Center opened a temporary year-round interpretive center in downtown Wabasha in a storefront building that formerly housed a bar. The center included two live permanently injured and non-releasable bald eagles, named Harriet and Angel. On May 2007, in a partnership with the City of Wabasha, the National Eagle Center opened interpretive center on the banks of the Mississippi River on the site of the Big Jo Flour Mill at the corner of Pembroke Avenue and Lawrence Boulevard in Wabasha. The facility, designed by LHB, Inc., includes a living aviary, environmental and cultural exhibits, classrooms, auditorium, indoor and outdoor viewing space, and gift shop. In its new building the National Eagle Center provides programming on Environmental Stewardship, Native American history, the culture of the region, and the important symbolic role of the bald eagle in the American military. Future Expansion Plans In 2016 the National Eagle Center revealed plans for a 15,000-square-foot expansion that would incorporate four historic buildings next to its existing structure in addition to adding an outdoor amphitheater, and more room to take care of the center's captive eagles. The expansion will also include additional gallery space to accommodate items from the Preston Cook Collection, over 25,000 items of art and artifacts depicting the eagle in American culture. Artworks include an original 1830s prints by naturalist and artist John James Audubon and Andy Warhol's 1983 bald eagle print. Facilities Aviary and Eagles The National Eagle Center, which houses both permanently injured and non- releasable bald and golden eagles call their resident eagles \\"ambassadors.\\" The eagles are housed in a climate-controlled interior aviary with glass panels that allow visitors to watch the eagles from a distance. Visitors are also able to enter the aviary when permitted. Approximately forty-five minute educational, and entertaining feeding programs are often given three times each day at 11 am, 1 pm, and 3 pm providing visitors with another opportunity to learn about the eagle, as well as participate in question and answer sessions.

It is also the source of concanavalin A.  Description  C. ensiformis is a twining plant up to in height. It has deep roots, which makes it drought resistant. The plant can spread via long runners. The flowers are pink-purple in colour. The pods are up to long with large white seeds.  Uses  The plant is not in large-scale commercial cultivation. The beans are mildly toxic, and copious consumption should be avoided. Boiling will, however, remove toxicity if done properly. Young foliage is also edible. The whole plant is used for fodder, although it cannot be used in fodder mixtures containing urea, since it contains large quantities of the enzyme urease, which liberates harmful ammonia from urea. For this reason C. ensiformis has been investigated as a potential source of the urease enzyme. It is also the source of concanavalin A, a lectin used in biotechnology applications, such as lectin affinity chromatography. As a garden plant, it can grow to over 2 meters, provided it gets enough nutrients, rich soil, sun and warmth. It grows therefore in rich soil, or use extra nutrients, in a sunny warm place.  Names  C. ensiformis has numerous names in English. They include many that are misleading or ambiguous, being derived from comparing the common jack bean to plants with similar seeds or fruit: they thrive in warm, sunny, places with much water or rain. *Brazilian broad bean *\\"Coffee bean\\" *Chickasaw lima bean *Ensiform bean *\\"Horse bean\\" (usually applied to Vicia faba) *\\"Jack bean\\" (also applied to other species in the genus Canavalia) *Mole bean *Overlook bean *Pearson bean *\\"Sword bean\\" (usually applied to Canavalia gladiata) *Wonder bean References  External links  ensiformis Category:Flora of Africa Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Fodder Category:Taxa named by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Canavalia ensiformis"},{"id":"13106455","title":"2006 California Attorney General election"},{"id":"13106497","text":"The Police Forensic Science Laboratory Dundee (PFSLD) was established in April 1989.

Output included not only rolling stock but also tools, equipment, huts, furniture and tarpaulins. It was a prodigious facility, and one of the larger employers in the city. Its name is sometimes formatted as Eastown or Easttown.  History  East Town was commissioned in August 1880 and was the second railway workshops established as part of Julius Vogel's public works programme. A contract was let in 1879 by public tender to the Wanganui firm of Gibbes and Pinches for the construction of a Locomotive Erecting Shop, Machine Shop and Wood Mill. The following year, a second contract was let to Thomson and McLean to construct the Blacksmiths Shop and attached Boiler Shop. Work up to 1900 focused on the repair of rolling stock operated in the area between Taranaki and Hawke's Bay. In 1900, the Engine Shed was relocated to the north- west corner of the yard. A single-road Paint Shop was erected, a wagon servicing pit was built, and the Erecting Shop was extended. As a result of the Royal Commission of 1925 conducted by English railwaymen Sir Sam Fay and Sir Vincent Raven, the output of the workshops changed. The capacity of the Locomotive Shop was dramatically reduced, and the Tarpaulin Shop augmented to handle the production requirements of the entire North Island. The Points and Crossings Shop previously located at the Addington Workshops was relocated to East Town. East Town had been operating as two complete sets of workshops for both the Maintenance Branch and the Locomotive Branch, separated by only a road. In August 1931, it was decided to amalgamate the facilities into a single operation, a move that proved to be beneficial for the staff in the form of improved conditions and schedules. As a result of this amalgamation, it was necessary to move the Points and Crossings Shop to the Hutt Workshops and the workshops once again focused on the repair of locomotives, carriages and brake vans. Later work done at East Town also included the manufacture and repair of tools, velocipedes, track gauges, railway huts, furniture for railway stations and offices, and heavy track machinery. Overhauls on shunting locomotives were also carried out at East Town from 1963, work that was previously done at the Hutt Workshops. Between 1947 and 1949, land was purchased at the west end of the yard and various workshop buildings were extended. A new Motor Shop was also erected. The first intake of apprentices, comprising nine carpenters and six fitters, started in January 1949 once a suitable building had been acquired. Further extensions were made to the Tarpaulin Shop in 1950, and a new Wagon Shop was also built. One thing for which East Town became particularly well known was the production of tarpaulins to cover goods wagons which were used at stations across the country. These were originally made of canvas and treated with linseed oil and vegetable black to weather-proof them. As the work was initially done by hand, those employed to make them were usually sailmakers by trade, with mechanisation not introduced until 1915. At the end of 1914, a new Tarpaulin Shop was commissioned, but it did not last long, being destroyed by fire in January 1915. In 1928, a dedicated tarpaulin factory was opened and, with the transfer of staff from the Newmarket Workshops, production increased to the rate of 50 tarpaulins per week. The Tarpaulin Manufacturing Shop was razed by fire on 5 August 1954, requiring an increase in the output of the Addington Workshops until the destroyed facility at East Town was replaced mid-1955. Just two months later, on 18 October, the Tarpaulin Depot Repair Shop was similarly destroyed. In 1973, NZR switched to using PVC tarpaulins which were cheaper to make and easier to repair. East Town closed on 17 October 1986 as the result of an effort by the New Zealand Railways Corporation to rationalise its workshop facilities around the country. At the time it closed, it was the employer of over 450 local residents. A replacement facility constructed at Aramoho has also since been closed.  Rolling stock  Some of the rolling stock work conducted at East Town included: * An order in 1951 for the production of 150 KC class box wagons. * The servicing of K class steam locomotives from 1932 until 1967. * The repair, in October 1946, of AB, F, K, and WW class locomotives. * Overhauling and engine upgrades for DB and DI class diesel locomotives from 1976 to 1980. * An order in mid 1979 for 85 YH class ballast wagons. * Overhauling the entire fleet of DE class locomotives, circa 1980. * Sharing in the re-engining of DSC class locomotives with Auckland and Palmerston North workshops.

Lamp Factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, was the product of a unique collaboration between industrialist Henry Ford and his lead designer, Albert Kahn. Ford systematically acquired land, an existing dam on the Huron River, and water rights in the area where the old Metler and Diekman Mills stood. These rights along with over from the George Case farm north and west of the mill race helped to comprise the eventual that Ford eventually would own. Construction of a factory and a dam were carried out during 1921 and 1922. The dam had a fourfold purpose: to serve as a power plant, retain water in connection with the newly built water filtration plant, and to serve as a railroad bridge and a road for the passage of cars. Together the factory, dam/bridge, and water filtration plant represent a comprehensive program for the improvement of Flat Rock. The factory, built by Stone & Webster, Inc., was one of several similar-appearing factories built for Ford, including others in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Green Island, New York, and Iron Mountain, Michigan. Large turbines were once situated within the factory building. The eastern end of the plant was suspended from the land over water running through the mill race below. A photo from the 1930s shows this equipment setting in situ. Water power first generated was about 700 kilowatts. Construction of the Ford complex had a profound and immediate impact on the residents of the area. The Village of Flat Rock was chartered on October 19, 1923. The following month the first headlamp was produced at the plant. So village and industry grew side-by-side. Products the factory made included headlights, taillights, and interior light shells, reflectors, and lamp sockets. Five hundred men working two shifts at the plant could produce half a million headlights a month. During World War II, all of the 26 or so village industries were converted to participate in the war effort. The Flat Rock plant which produced head- and taillights, continued to produce these during the war, but for army trucks, Jeeps, tanks, the universal carrier, and the armored car. The Flat Rock plant also manufactured junction boxes for the B-24 bomber. Benefits of having the Ford factory in the village of Flat Rock were numerous. First, there were the jobs created. Employment rose from 50 workers in 1924 to 500 by 925 and a peak of 1,200 people in 1929. In wages alone, over a half-million dollars in wages were paid in the peak years of 1929 and 1930. Approximately a third of the tax revenue for the village of Flat Rock was also generated by the plant. Another benefit came from the water filtration plant. This produced water for the factory, but also for the communities of Flat Rock, Rockwood, and South Rock. The original filtration plant built in the 1920s was sold to the then City of Flat Rock in 1951 and continued to operate until 1957 when a new plant was built on the island, directly opposite and to the south of the Ford plant. This filtration plant too was eventually abandoned, though has not been demolished due to prohibitive costs associated with demolition. Commentators attribute the demise of the village industries concept, which the Flat Rock plant was part of, to a variety of factors including company leadership not understanding the value or money-making potential of these enterprises, obsolescence of facilities, and most prominently ‚Äì unionization (Siegel). Production at the Flat Rock Head & Tail Light Plant ceased in 1950, and operations were moved to the larger Monroe factory. In 1950 the vacant Flat Rock plant was sold to Moynahan Bronze Company that was then located in Detroit and which subsequently moved. This company produced furniture for Pullman cars, architectural molding, and parts for aircraft. The firm would occupy the plant from 1951 to 1972. Stearns Manufacturing owned and operated the plant from 1972 to 1981, at which time the present owner, Flat Rock Metal Inc., leased the building. The company has since purchased it and has occupied the building to the present time (2018).

Description A woody perennial, S. simplex can grow as a shrub or as suckering herb with short-lived stems arising from a perennial rootstock. Stems may be up to ten centimetres long, and the plant as a whole grows to a height of from ten to 60 centimetres, rarely to one metre. It has soft leaves that bifurcate repeatedly into lobes, with the final lobes measuring from two to twenty millimetres long. Flowers are cream or yellow, and occur in dense heads from ten to 15 millimetres in diameter, atop scapes up to 60 centimetres tall. Taxonomy The species was first published by John Lindley in his 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony, based on unspecified material. Lindley commented that it \\"resembles a Sanicula\\". Since that time, it has had a fairly straightforward taxonomic history. It has only two synonyms: * Carl Meissner published S. capillifolia in 1855, but this was declared a taxonomic synonym of S. simplex by Alex George in 1995. * In 1884 Ferdinand von Mueller proposed to transfer Stirlingia to Simsia, the original, albeit illegal, name for the genus. His transfer was not accepted, and Simsia simplex is now a nomenclatural synonym of Stirlingia simplex. Distribution and habitat It occurs throughout much of the Southwest Botanic Province of Western Australia, from Eneabba in the north, south to Waroona and east to Hyden. It grows in a variety of soils, amongst proteaceous-myrtaceous heath and eucalypt woodland, and prefers seasonally wet areas. Ecology It is not considered threatened.

It was first developed by Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá Institute in Zagreb, Croatia. The system links genes to their founder gene, allowing us to then determine their age. This could in turn help us better understand many evolutionary processes.  Method  An example of a 420x420px This technique relies on the assumption that the diversity of the genome is not only due to gene duplications but also to continuous frequent de novo gene births. These genes (called \\"founder genes\\") would form from non-genic DNA sequences, as well as from changes in reading frame (or other ways of arising from within existing genes), or even from very rapid evolution of the protein that would modify the sequence beyond recognition. These new genes would at first have high evolutionary rates that would then slow down with time, allowing us to recognise their lineage in their descendants. The founder genes can then be put in a specific phylostratum. The phylostratum is represented as the clade that includes all the genes that derive from the same founder gene, signifying that this gene was formed in the common ancestor of this clade (e.g. Arthropoda, Mammalia, Metazoa, etc.). Positioning these founder genes and their descendants on different phylostrata can allow us to age them. This can then be used to analyse the origin of certain functions of proteins and developmental processes on a macroevolutionary scale, by observing connections between certain genes as well. The original method for genomic phylostratigraphy involves the use of a BLAST sequence similarity search with a 10‚àí3 E-value cut off. The genes deemed similar enough in sequence are gathered and the clade englobing all the taxa represented by those genes is determined. This clade then becomes the phylostratum of these genes. By determining the common ancestor of this clade, we can hence give an age to the founder gene and all its descendants. Applying the process on a genome-wide scale can then allow us to detect patterns of founder genes births and infer the role of certain genes involved in clade-specific developmental processes and physiological pathways, and the origin of those traits. The developers of the method gave in the original paper an example how to exploit this system in practice using Drosophila. They gathered 13,000 genes for which they determined the founder genes, regrouping them in their respective phylostrata. They also segregated the families of genes depending on whether they were mainly expressed in either of the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm). By studying the frequencies of expression of genes in those different phylostrata, they were able to hypothetically pinpoint the possible original formation of those germ layers to specific periods and ancestral organisms in evolutionary history. Since its invention, genomic phylostratigraphy has been regularly used by this research team as well as others, notably in an attempt to determine the origin of cancer genes, seemingly showing a strong link between a peak in the formation of cancer genes and the transition to multicellular organisms, a connection which had been previously hypothesised and is hence further supported by phylostratigraphy. As its use has grown, the method has been assessed and enhanced on multiple occasions, and programs that run it automatically and more efficiently have been developed.  Criticism  Albeit it being now used frequently by the scientific community, genomic phylostratigraphy has also received some criticism for being too inaccurate for its measurements to be trustworthy. First of all, according to some authors precision lacks in the assumptions. It is erroneous to assume for example that all species beyond the organism of focus share the same protein evolutionary rate, which isn't true as it varies depending on cell cycle speeds, leading to problems in setting the limits of BLAST error to englobe all proteins originated from the same founder gene. Another point is that the BLAST search assumes that protein evolutionary rates is constant at all its sites, which is also false. Lastly, it could be said that the model does not account correctly for gene duplications, as well as gene losses: the changes in evolutionary rates caused by gene duplications due to new functional changes would increase BLAST error rates, and gene loss in taxa distant to the one studied could lead to great underestimations in the calculated gene age and phylostratum of founder genes compared to their true values. However, rather than demanding to simply abandon the method, critics have been trying to work at refining it from its original state, by introducing other potential mathematical formulas or sequence searching tools, although the Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá Institute has replied to such criticism claiming their original approach was valid and did not need to be extensively revised. This debate is also included as part of the wider discussion on the importance of de novo gene births in creating genetic diversity, in which genomic phylostratigraphy supports that they do hold a strong effect, in a way that it can only be widely accepted or refuted once the latter dilemma has been resolved.

Location The village is part of the barony of Inchiquin, about from Corofin on the road to Gort in County Galway. The village of Tubber in County Clare is the southern part of a loosely defined rural community that spans the border between County Galway and County Clare. Tubber, County Galway is adjacent and lies in the parish of Beagh in the Diocese of Kilmacduagh. The area as a whole roughly encompasses the townlands with a radius of St Michael's church at Tubber Cross. A 2001 travelogue described Tubber as \\"a place a mile long with a pub at either end ... one part of it appeared to be in Clare, the other in Galway.\\" The village of Tubber is small, centred on the church and the local primary school. Tubber National School was established in 1852 as part of the chapel of Tubber, with about a hundred pupils. It taught Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, History and Geography. The teacher was paid a small salary, and charged small fees to senior pupils who could afford it. Conor Engineering has their plant on the Crusheen road. The company has been manufacturing farm machinery since 1969.

His festival fell on 3 March. The remains of the later Kilkeedy church date to the 14th century. There was an old church at Kells, or Cealla in Irish, but little remains of the site. Another ruined church near Boston, surrounded by a burial ground, seems very old. In 1897 part of the east gable was still standing. The remains of other ancient churches are Templenadeirce, Cill Taice and Teampal Mor (Templemore). The Teampall na D√©irce Graveyard is southeast of the Tubber-Ruan road in the townland of Shanballysallagh at . The ruins of the church are at the north of the cemetery. The gravestones face east. The 1580 list of castles in Thomond included the following in the parish: Cloonselherney and Carrownagowle, owned by Dermot OBrien; Baunkippaun and Derryowen by the Baron of Inchiquin; Kilkeedy and Cloonduan by Mahone O‚ÄôBrien, his son; and Moyree by the Earl of Thomond. In 1837 the castle at Fidane was in good condition. The Derryowen castle was a square tower in height with spacious rooms, but by 1837 part of it had fallen, The people of the parish participated in the Irish Agrarian Rebellion of 1821-24. In September 1823 at Tubber fair a man named Harvey, looking for corn that had been seized for arrears of rent and then stolen from official custody, was beaten and left for dead. Around 1837 a well-attended fair was held at Turraghmore on 8 June and fairs were held at Tubber on 12 July and 20 September, mainly for cattle. In 1841 the population was 4,192 in 690 houses. The parish today has a relatively small population, with about 560 people as of 2014. The population had earlier been as high as 3,975 just before the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì52. Catholic parish The boundaries of the Catholic parish are the same as the medieval parish of Kilkeedy. There are two churches in the parish, St Michael's in Tubber and All Saints in Boston. Both were built in 1865. The parish is in the Diocese of Killaloe. Tubber parish is home to the Tubber GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club. The small hurling club is an important part of the parish life. In Clare hurling the club won the 1972 intermediate championship, the 1962 junior championship and the Clare Champion Cup in 1985.

The community's youth, who are not very strongly represented, like to gather at the Backes (an old baking house). Culinary specialities Moreover, there is something else that sets Astert apart, its speciality. It is known as Asterter Kl√ºsen ‚Äì a regional word for dumplings. They are a well loved dish not only among the locals, but also for people from the neighbouring communities, who enjoy this hearty dish. The dumplings‚Äô recipe and preparation, however, are things that only longtime village ladies may know. The art of cooking the Asterter Kl√ºsen, though, is taught younger ladies so that this delight does not pass away into legend.

T&T; Clark 2014 p.21 Career In 1971 Lemche received his undergraduate degree in theology at the University of Copenhagen, starting his long career at that institution. From 1972 to 1978 he worked there in various capacity until he was taken on as an associate professor. In 1985 he finished his doctorate in theology with a thesis on \\"Early Israel\\", a topic which has kept his interest for the last three decades. In 1987 Lemche founded the Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament with Knud Jeppesen, a publication he has been associated with to the present time as chief editor. In 1987 he became Professor of Old Testament exegesis at the Faculty of Theology and served as vice dean of the faculty from 1993 to 1999. Scholarly interests Lemche is closely identified with the movement known as biblical minimalism, and \\"has assumed the role of philosophical and methodological spokesperson\\" for the movement.Ziony Zevit, \\"Three Debates About Bible and Archaeology\\", Biblica, Biblica 83 (2002) 1-27 Charles David Isbell sees Lemche as attempting to dismantle and discredit the \\"historical-critical\\" method of Old Testament scholarship. Lemche himself writes that the 'so-called \\"historical-critical\\" school that created a universe of its own dubbed \\"ancient Israel\\" has dominated the last two hundred years of biblical studies.' He argues that \\"ancient Israel\\" is the product of the Jewish community that was of \\"the Persian and especially Hellenistic and Roman periods\\". In common with the general trend of modern scholarship, Lemche identifies the Persian and Hellenistic period (5th century to 4th century BCE) as the most appropriate setting in which to seek the composition of the majority of the biblical texts, arguing that this is the single period that best explains the 'mental matrix‚Äô for most Old Testament literature and \\"probably all of its historiography\\". Lemche considers the traditional narratives of Israel's history as contained in the bible to be so late in origin as to be useless for historical reconstruction. His alternative reconstruction is based entirely on the archaeological record, and may be summarized as follows: From at least as early as the first half of the 14th century BCE the central highlands were the habitation of the Apiru, \\"a para- social element ... [consisting] of runaway former non-free peasants or copyholders from the small city-states in the plains and valleys of Palestine,\\" living as \\"outlaw groups of freebooters\\". When new settlements appear in the highlands over a century later, at the start of the Iron Age, they are evidence of new political structures emerging among those same groups. The Iron I settlements attest a return by those groups to a settled, agricultural lifestyle, and the beginning of a (re)tribalization process. Israel was the end-product of that process. Lemche's view has much in common with that of Israel Finkelstein, and forms part of a widespread re-assessment of Israel's origins and of the historicity of the bible.Lemche's Evolutionary Israel, in John J.

Biography Family background Schomberg was born in Dublin, the youngest son of the naval officer Captain Sir Alexander Schomberg and Arabella Susannah, the only child of the Reverend Henry Chalmers, and niece of Sir Edmund Aleyn. His older brother was Admiral Alexander Wilmot Schomberg. Early naval career Schomberg entered the navy in 1788 as captain's servant on the yacht of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, , under his father's command. From 1793, at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, he served as midshipman aboard and the 74-gun under Captain Thomas Louis. On 30 April 1795 he was promoted to lieutenant, and was transferred to , serving under the Commanders Willoughby Lake and John Cochet, until returning to Minotaur in August 1796. In early 1797 Minotaur was sent to reinforce the fleet off C√°diz and was engaged in several boat actions with the Spanish flotilla and shore batteries. Minotaur remained part of the inshore squadron off C√°diz until 24 May 1798, when she sailed for the Mediterranean, in company with a squadron under the command of Captain Thomas Troubridge. They joined the squadron of Sir Horatio Nelson near Toulon, and subsequently defeated the French at the battle of the Nile in August 1798. During the battle Minotaur fought , and after her surrender she was taken possession of by Schomberg. Between November 1798 and October 1799 Schomberg, now the first lieutenant of Minotaur, was employed on the coast of the Kingdom of Naples. In mid-1800 Minotaur served as the flagship of Lord Keith at the siege of Genoa. On 3 September 1800, under the command of Captain James Hillyar of , Schomberg led the boats of Minotaur in the successful cutting out of the Spanish corvettes Esmeralda and Paz off Barcelona. Schomberg then served as Flag Lieutenant to Lord Keith, aboard , during the Egyptian Campaign. He was sent to Cairo to act as a liaison officer between Keith and the Kapudan Pasha, the commander of Turkish naval forces, during the Siege of Alexandria. Schomberg was appointed acting-commander of the sloop , though it is unclear if he ever took command of her as he was employed onshore until the surrender of the French in September 1801. He was appointed to command of , a 44-gun ship armed en fl√ªte, employed in transporting French troops from Alexandria to Malta, under the terms of the French capitulation. Following the evacuation of Egypt Schomberg was sent on a mission to Tunis, for which Sir Alexander Ball, the Governor of Malta, later presented him with a handsome piece of plate, and for his services in Egypt he was awarded the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Crescent. On 29 April 1802 his promotion to commander was confirmed. Post-captain Schomberg was promoted to post- captain on 6 August 1803, and he took command of the 54-gun , stationed as guard ship at Malta. Lord Collingwood nominated Schomberg for command of , but she was wrecked on 27 October 1806. In February 1807 Schomberg took part in the failed Dardanelles Operation under John Duckworth, but on his return to Malta Madras was put out of commission, and he returned to England, after an absence of more than ten years. On his arrival he was appointed to and immediately sailed from Torbay to Lisbon, to announce the imminent arrival of a British squadron, sent to evacuate the royal family of Portugal, as the French were about to enter the country. Unfortunately poor weather and contrary winds meant he arrived off the Tagus after the British squadron, and so negotiations were already underway by Sir W. Sidney Smith, who he then joined aboard Foudroyant as flag captain as they transported the royal family to Brazil in November 1807. Schomberg was later made a Knight of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword. In January 1809 while at Rio de Janeiro Smith appointed Schomberg to command of , but when the Admiralty sent out another captain for that ship, Schomberg was relieved of command, and returned to England in April 1810. In July he was appointed to the frigate , which he fitted out and sailed to the Cape of Good Hope in company with , flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. On their arrival Stopford sent Astraea and to reinforce the squadron stationed off the √éle de France (now Mauritius) under Captain Philip Beaver in . The Battle of Tamatave In the absence of Captain Beaver, Schomberg was in command on 20 May 1811, when , the frigates Phoebe and , and the brig-sloop met and defeated a force of three large French frigates that were bringing reinforcements to Mauritius (unaware of its capture by the British the previous November). One French frigate, Renomm√©e, surrendered to Schomberg's ship; N√©r√©ide escaped, only to surrender at Tamatave in Madagascar a few days later; and escaped for good. The Battle of Tamatave marked the last French attempt to operate in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. In April 1813, following the unexpected death of Captain Beaver, Schomberg took command of , and sailed from the Cape to Brazil, and from there to Portsmouth escorting a large merchant convoy, arriving at Spithead in March 1814. Schomberg was preparing his ship for service in North America, when the Admiralty ordered her to be put out of commission. Later career Schomberg was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815. From April 1820 to April 1824 he commanded as flag captain to Sir Graham Moore in the Mediterranean, and from September 1828 until 1832 served as Commodore and Commander-in-Chief at the Cape of Good Hope Station, with as his flagship. On 21 September 1832 he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order. On 7 February 1833 Schomberg was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Dominica. He died on 2 January 1835, while in that service, aboard , the flagship of Sir George Cockburn, while anchored in Carlisle Bay. He was interred in St Paul's Chapel on the same day.

Biography Arthur Lett was born 2 November 1894, at 9 Walterton Road, Paddington, London, the son of Charles Lett and Frances Laura Esme Lett (who afterwards married S. Sidney Haines). He was educated at St Paul's School, London. In the First World War he served in the British Army.

This relationship lasted some 60 years, despite its open nature that included attachments on both sides such as Haines' affair with the artist and author Kathleen Hale. After initially living at Newlyn, they moved to Paris in 1920, becoming part of an expatriate artistic community that included Juan Gris, Fernand L√©ger, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Nancy Cunard and Ernest Hemingway. They returned briefly to London in 1926, before moving in 1929 to Suffolk. Lett-Haines gravestone, near to that of Cedric Morris, at Hadleigh Cemetery, Hadleigh In 1937, Morris and Haines founded the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing at Dedham. When it burned down in 1939, the school was relocated to Benton End, a large house near Hadleigh. Operating on a live-in basis that mingled artistic development with a social circle, its pupils included Lucian Freud, Bettina Shaw-Lawrence, David Kentish, Maggi Hambling, David Carr, Joan Warburton and Glyn Morgan. He exhibited at the Ipswich Art Club in 1942 Parmi Les Fleurs. In 1946, along with Henry Collins, Cedric Morris, John Nash and Roderic Barrett, Lett Haines became one of the founders of Colchester Art Society and later the Society's President. The school closed when Haines died in 1978, though Morris continued to live at Benton End until his death in 1984. They are buried near each other at Hadleigh Cemetery in Hadleigh.

It was announced in February 2007.Microsoft Press Release The main differences relative to previous DRM schemes from Microsoft are: * Some popular features that were already present in other DRM schemes in the market have been added; these include the concept of domain (group of devices belonging to the same user which can share the same licenses), Embedded Licenses (licenses that are embedded in the content files, avoiding a separate step for license acquisition) and envelopes (the ability to DRM arbitrary, potentially non- media content). It is also the protection scheme for IIS Smooth Streaming, Microsoft's adaptive streaming technology. * It is platform-independent: unlike other Microsoft DRM schemes like Janus, PlayReady can be ported to any kind of portable device, even if it uses non-Microsoft technology (OS, codecs, media player, etc.). PlayReady competes with other proprietary DRM schemes and even more with DRM-free software, most notably Apple's FairPlay introduced in iTunes and QuickTime. There are several other DRM schemes that are competing to become the dominant DRM technology (e.g. Widevine). Microsoft released the first version of the PlayReady suite (Porting Kit for devices, PC SDK and runtime, Server SDK) in June 2008. Silverlight 2.0, released in October 2008, supports content restricted with PlayReady. As of Silverlight 4.0, the implementation of Microsoft PlayReady in Silverlight supports offline content (via persisted license), subscription scenarios (via chained licenses) and online, streaming-only content (via simple non-persistent licenses). Output protection support was also added in Silverlight 4.0.

It is immediately junior to captain and immediately senior to the rank of lieutenant commander. Officers holding the junior rank of lieutenant commander are not considered to be commanders. History The title (originally 'master and commander')See also: Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian. originated in around 1670 to describe Royal Navy officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant, but too small to warrant the assignment of a post-captain, or (before about 1770) a sailing-master who was in charge of a ship's navigation. These ships were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns, fireships, hospital ships and store ships. The commanding officer of this type of ship was responsible for both sailing and fighting the ship and was thus its 'master and commander'. Before 1750, the rank was broadly considered as the limit of advancement for those without patronage, especially those who had been promoted from among a ship's crew. By contrast, those with Parliamentary supporters or family connections were more likely to spend only a nominal period as master and commander of a sloop, before being elevated to post- captain. From 1718, the Navy List began recording an officer's date of appointment to the rank of master and commander, with the intention of establishing seniority as a guide to promotion, but there is little evidence that this carried through into actual appointments. Over the later eighteenth century, the rank evolved into a more regular stage of service between lieutenant and captain. The Royal Navy shortened 'master and commander' to 'commander' in 1794; however, the term 'master and commander' remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years. The rank was a popular recognition of service during the Napoleonic Wars, resulting in promotion of more commanders than there were commands; in 1812 the Navy List recorded 586 commanders against 168 available vessels. Commanders unable to secure a ship were left ashore on half-pay, with limited prospects for future advancement. This promotions bottleneck was addressed from 1827 with the introduction of commanders as a second-in-command on larger vessels. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4, matching the army rank of lieutenant colonel. Seniority and usage A commander in the Royal Navy is senior to an officer holding the rank of lieutenant commander but junior to a captain. A commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, mine countermeasures squadron, fishery protection squadron, patrol boat squadron, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff. Formerly equivalent to the Army rank of major, a commander is now equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel in the British Army or a wing commander in the Royal Air Force. The rank of wing commander was derived from the naval rank of commander via the usage in the World War I Royal Naval Air Service. The rank insignia of a commander features three rings of gold braid with a loop in the upper ring.

Born in Latvia and trained in Germany, Lavry immigrated to Palestine in 1936, where he was instrumental in developing the \\"Mediterranean School\\"Irene Heskes, Passport to Jewish Music (1994, Greenwood Press, ), p.248. of composition, that merged elements of Arabic and oriental Jewish music with western art music. Biography Lavry was born Mark Levin in Riga, Latvia on December 22, 1903. As a child, he studied piano at the Riga Conservatory of Music, where he also began composing. After graduating high school, he moved to Germany, where he earned a degree in architecture, and continued his music studies at the Leipzig Conservatory. He studied piano with Professor Robert Teichm√ºller, and composition with Paul Graener, and later with Alexander Glazunov. After discovering there already was an older, then more established composer and conductor named Mark Levin, he decided to change his own name to Marc Lavry.http://www.marclavry.org/biography/ He began his conducting career as music director of the opera house in Saarbr√ºcken, and later, of the Tanzb√ºhne Laban, the dance theater directed by modern dance pioneer Rudolf von Laban. In 1929, he became conductor of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra (not the more famous Berlin Philharmonic). In 1933, the Nazis, who had assumed power in Germany, disbanded the orchestra. Lavry returned to Riga, where he became resident conductor of the Riga Opera. However, as antisemitism intensified in Latvia as well, Lavry and his wife decided to emigrate to Palestine in 1935. Though not a Zionist, Lavry felt a strong connection with the emerging Jewish state. \\"I immigrated to Israel in 1935 and immediately felt that I found my spiritual homeland\\", he wrote in his autobiography.Marc Lavry, Autobiography (1946), published by the Marc Lavry Heritage Foundation. \\"Nowhere until arriving to Israel, did I feel that grounded. I felt that I landed where I belong and that I found a place worth fighting for. I felt that the country inspired me as a composer and that here I wrote my best compositions.\\" He became resident composer of the Ohel Theater in Tel Aviv in 1941, and also served as conductor of the Palestine Folk Opera. There he composed the first Hebrew-language opera \\"Dan the Guard\\". In 1948 he moved to Jerusalem to undertake the creation of the Kol Zion Lagola radio station. There, he founded the first professional choir in Israel, and was instrumental in the development of Israeli music. In 1963, at the invitation of Haifa mayor Abba Hushi, Lavry moved to Haifa to conduct the Haifa symphony. He remained there until his death in 1967. He was survived by three children.Details of Lavry's life from \\"Biography\\" at the Marc Lavry Heritage Foundation. Music While still in Berlin, Lavry showed an interest in Jewish music. There he wrote the Jewish Suite for string quartet (Op. 17), Hassidic Dance (Op. 22) for orchestra, and Ahasver, the Wandering Jew for orchestra (Op. 23). In Palestine, Lavry joined a group of leading composers, many of whom had, like him, escaped from Nazi persecution, including Alexander Uriah Boskovich, Paul Ben-Haim, √ñd√∂n P√°rtos, and others. These composers were actively seeking to create a new, national form of music for the emerging Jewish state.Jehoash Hirshberg, Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880 - 1948 (1995, Oxford University Press, ), pp. 229-240. This new style, dubbed \\"the Mediterranean School\\" by Boskovich, incorporated elements of Middle-eastern music, including melisma, homophony, and use of unconventional musical modes. While not enamoured of the ideology behind the creation of a national musical style, Lavry found himself swept up by this tide. \\"I never attempted consciously to compose in the Israeli style,\\" he wrote in his autobiography.Lavry, Autobiography \\"I didn‚Äôt try, upon arriving in Israel, to impose upon myself a specific conception. Yet, as soon as I became encompassed with the influence of the country, when I found myself to be an integral part of Israel, when I mastered the Hebrew language ‚Äî in the most natural way ‚Äî I began composing in that style which I write till today.\\" Many of Lavry's songs have entered the canonical body of Israeli folk music called \\"Land of Israel songs\\" (\\"Shirey Eretz Yisrael\\"), including Emek, Kaha Merakdim, Kumi Tsi Achoti Kala, and more. But Lavry never saw himself as a writer of popular music, and his oeuvre reflects a merger of traditional folk and classical styles. Immediately after composing the song Emek, for example, he produced the symphonic tone poem Emek using the same melody. His opera, Dan the Guard (Dan HaShomer), is another example. Lavry uses different musical styles to depict different ethnic types - \\"the augmented second for the old Polish Jews... a horra dance in parallel fifths for the festive event of the communal laundry...[and] operatic cliches, mostly derived from Puccini...\\" wrote Jehoash Hirshberg, a historian of Israeli musicHirshberg, p.269. Together with choreographer Gertrud Kraus, Lavry developed the art of dance and Israel ballet. The oratorio \\"Song of Songs\\" (, shir ha-shirim) has been performed many times and Lavry's choral music and arias have become part of the repertoire of choirs and singers in Israel and abroad.

It represents a combination of cuisine of the Indian subcontinent with the cooking styles and recipes of Central Asian and Iranian cuisine. Mughlai cuisine is strongly influenced by the Turko-Persian cuisine of Central Asia, the region where the early Mughal emperors originally hailed from, and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of modern Afghanistan, Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and are often associated with a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices. A Mughlai course is an elaborate buffet of main course dishes with a variety of accompaniments.  History  Although the ruling class and administrative elite of the Mughal Empire could variously identify themselves as Turani (Turkic), Irani (Persian), Shaikhzada (Indian Muslim) and Hindu Rajput, the empire itself was Indo-Persian, having a hybridized, pluralistic Persianate culture. Decorated Indo-Persian cookbooks and culinary manuscripts adorned the personal libraries of the Mughal elite, serving as both culinary guides and for aesthetic value. One example was the Ni'matnama, a 15th-century work illustrated with Persian miniatures. This was commissioned by Sultan Ghiyas Shah, a sultan of Malwa in modern-day Madhya Pradesh, and features Central Asian dishes such as samosas (fried meat-filled pastry), khichri (rice and lentils), pilaf (rice-dish), sikh (skewered meat and fish), kabab (skewered, roasted meat) and yakhni (meat broth), as well as western and southern Indian dishes, such as karhi (yogurt broth mixed with chickpea flour), piccha and khandawi. From the Mughal period itself, one popular culinary work was the Nuskha-i-Shahjahani, a record of the dishes believed to be prepared for the court of Emperor Shahjahan (r.1627-1658). This Persian manuscript features ten chapters, on nƒÅnhƒÅ (breads), ƒÅsh-hƒÅ (pottages), qalƒ´yas and dopiyƒÅzas (dressed meat dishes), bhartas, zerbiryƒÅns (a kind of layered rice-based dish), pulƒÅ æo, kabƒÅbs, harƒ´sas (savoury porridge), shishrangas and ·∏µ·∫ñƒÅgƒ´nas (omelette), and khich·πõƒ´; the final chapter involves murabbƒÅ (jams), achƒÅr (pickles), p≈´rƒ´ (fried bread), shƒ´rƒ´nƒ´ (sweets), ·∏•alwƒÅ (warm pudding), and basic recipes for the preparation of yoghurt, panƒ´r (Indian curd cheese) and the coloring of butter and dough. Another famous textbook was ·∏¥·∫ñulƒÅ·π£at-i MƒÅk≈´lƒÅt u Mashr≈´bƒÅt, perhaps dating to the era of the emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1656-1707), while another was AlwƒÅn-i Ni ømat, a work dedicated solely to sweetmeats. Divya Narayanan writes: > These include varieties of sweet breads such as nƒÅn ·∏µ·∫ñatƒÅÃ§ æƒ´ (crisp bread, > like a biscuit), sweet p≈´rƒ´s, sweet samosas (or sa·πÉbosas), la·∏ç·∏ç≈´ and ·∏•alwƒÅ. > The cookbook introduces each recipe with a line of praise: for instance > sa·πÉbosa-i yak tuhƒ´ dam dƒÅda (samosa with a pocket cooked on dam) is declared > as being ‚Äòamong the famous and well-known sweets; p≈´rƒ´ dam dƒÅda bƒÅdƒÅmƒ´ > (almond p≈´rƒ´s cooked on dam) is said to be ‚Äòamong the delicious and > excellent sweetmeats, and nƒÅn ·∏µ·∫ñatƒÅÃ§ æƒ´ bƒÅdƒÅmƒ´ (almond nƒÅn ·∏µ·∫ñatƒÅÃ§ æƒ´) is noted > for being ‚Äòamong the rare and delicious recipes. There are even many commonalities between Indo-Persian cookbooks used at the Mughal court and contemporary culinary works from Safavid Iran, such as the KƒÅrnƒÅma dar bƒÅb-i TÃ§abƒÅ·∏µ·∫ñƒ´ wa ·π£an øat-i ƒÅn (Manual on Dishes and their Preparation) of ·∏§ƒÅjƒ´ Mu·∏•ammad  øAlƒ´ BƒÅwarchƒ´ BagÃ±·∫ñdƒÅdƒ´. Mughlai cuisine is renowned for the richness and aromaticity of the meals due to extensive use of spices like saffron, cardamom, black pepper, dry fruits and nuts, as well as rich cream, milk and butter in preparation of curry bases. This has influenced the development of North Indian cuisine.

Formation This unit was formed from volunteers from all eight regiments and corps units of the Brigade of Gurkhas on 1 January 1963, with the original role of airfield seizure for 17th Gurkha Division, with an all ranks strength of 128 men. Parachute training was conducted in Malaya, with selection carried out at Johore Baru under Captain Bruce Niven of the 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles. Operations Under the command of Major Peter Quantrill, 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles, the company was initially employed in an infantry role. The company was deployed to Sarawak and split up into groups of two or three with the mission of training and commanding the Border Scouts (which was composed of Iban natives). This was less than successful, due to the inadequacies of the Iban and morale suffered accordingly. After a debacle at the kampong of Long Jawi, the Border Scouts were disarmed and restricted to an information gathering role, which released the company for other duties. It was at this time, Major L.M. 'Phil' Phillips, 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles took command. The company was concentrated together at Kuching, and operated in the \\"Fire Brigade\\" role, moving to wherever it was needed at short notice. It carried out a number of such operations in support of 3 Commando Brigade in the Lundu area. Change of role In 1964, the Company returned to the mainland, and was based at the Kota Tinggi Jungle Warfare School in Johor Bahru. Shortly after Major Phillips was informed by the Director of Operations, Borneo that the Company would return to Borneo to operate in the SAS role. Lt. Col. John Woodhouse, Commanding Officer of 22 SAS assisted Major Phillips in planning the conversion of the Company. The Company reorganised from three platoons into 16 five-man patrols (commander, medical orderly, two assault pioneers and a signaller). The reasons behind the adoption of the five man patrol were that company's primary role was still airfield assault, and its strength of 128 all ranks was based on that role. The company underwent a short period of training and weeding out, assisted by 2 members of 22 SAS. The Signallers were provided by Queen's Gurkha Signals and the patrol medics were trained at the British Military Hospital, Singapore. Second tour By August 1964, training was complete, and the attempted invasion of the mainland by Indonesian troops provided a good 'shake down' for the Company. In October 1964, the Company returned to Borneo, where it relieved No.1 (Guards) Independent Company at Sibu. During the next 6 months, the Company patrolled constantly, patrols being rotated to allow them to rest and recuperate at the company base. There were no contacts with the enemy, although a number of unauthorised forays across the Indonesian border were carried out. In April 1965, the Company returned to the mainland, to a new base at Kluang. Major John Cross assumed command and the company spent the next five months retraining and recruiting new members. In September, the Company returned to Borneo, taking part in Operation Claret, a series of cross-border operations. In June 1966, the Company was formally affiliated to the Parachute Regiment and its members wore the maroon beret and badge of the regiment, the latter worn on a rifle green backing bearing the colours of the Brigade of Gurkhas. The end In 1968, the company reverted to the organization of a conventional rifle company, and its original role of airfield seizure. It was based once more at Kota Tinggi, where it acted as the demonstration company. In 1971 the Brigade of Gurkhas moved to Hong Kong, where no role was envisioned for an airborne unit, consequently, on 31 October, the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company was disbanded. Active service Borneo Oct 1964-April 1965, Sept 1965-April 1966.

After the devastating effects of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48), it counted, together with nearby Siershahn, only 42 inhabitants. Ebernhahn's name comes from the Old High German word hag (‚Äúenclosure‚Äù), making the name's meaning, roughly, ‚Äúbelonging to the boar‚Äôs enclosure‚Äù; Eber is German for ‚Äúboar‚Äù. Ebernhahn was at first under the governance of the Electorate of Trier, later passing to the Duchy of Nassau and later still, in 1866, to Prussia. Since 1971 it has belonged to what was then the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Wirges, a kind of collective municipality, and since 1974 it has been part of the Westerwaldkreis whose district seat is in Montabaur. In the mid 19th century, industry began to make inroads into the community, above all clay quarrying businesses. With industrialization, the community underwent, as did all communities in the Kannenb√§ckerland, a swift upswing in growth. While Ebernhahn counted only 241 inhabitants in 1818, by century's end, this had grown to some 500. Since the quarrying businesses drew so many people from beyond Ebernhahn into the community, there was a necessary reaction to this in the community itself in the form of a developing transport trade. This gave rise to local passenger- and goods-moving businesses whose descendants can still be found today, long after clay quarrying ended. On 11 March 1945, the community was bombed by the United States Army Air Forces; 52 people were killed and 32 buildings were thoroughly destroyed. Parish of Maria Empf√§ngnis, Ebernhahn Parish‚Äôs history In 1902, Ebernhahn was made an autonomous chapel-parish. In 1921, Ebernhahn became a parish vicariate, and in 1964 it was raised to parish. Until April 1984, the parish had its own clergyman. Since then, it has shared one with the neighbouring parish of Dernbach. Given the increasing dearth of clergymen, Ebernhahn, and indeed Dernbach too, had to be grouped into the parish cluster (Pfarreienverband) of Wirges in 1996 while otherwise retaining its status as a parish. Church‚Äôs history In 1871, the first chapel was built in Ebernhahn. This was forsaken in 1911 for the new church, Maria Empf√§ngnis. The church was expanded in 1958 and finished in 1968 with the belfry that it has today, which replaced the earlier onion-domed tower. In 1978, the interior was renovated. In 1997 extensive work was done on the church's exterior. Moreover, the rectory and sacristy were remodelled. In 2006 came a radical renovation and remodelling of the church's interior. A decisive architectural feature resulting from this is the shifting of the altar from the sanctuary forwards to the centre of a half-circle consisting of four segments, made out of old pews. On 4 November 2006, the new altar, whose capstone was made from the old altar, was consecrated by Abbot emeritus Dr. Thomas Denter. Patron‚Äôs festival and church consecration The parish patron's festival is on 8 December, the ‚Äúhigh festival of the Mother of God conceived without original sin‚Äù. The church consecration festival is celebrated each year on the first Sunday in May. Community council The council is made up of 17 council members, including the extraofficial mayor (B√ºrgermeister), who were elected in a municipal election on 7 June 2009. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\" CDU |FWG Ebernhahn |WG - Schmidt |Total |- align=\\"center\\" 2004 |5 |7 |4 |16 Seats |} Village hymn Since June 2006, Ebernhahn has had its own anthem, called Dou bess dott Dorf (Ebernhahn dialect for Du bist das Dorf ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou are the village‚Äù). Partnerships Since 1973, there has existed a partnership between Ebernhahn and the French community of Marolles-les-Braults in the department of Sarthe. The official partnership meetings take place each year on Whitsun weekend, in Ebernhahn in even-numbered years and in Marolles- les-Braults in odd-numbered years. On 22 April 2007, the square outside the multi-purpose hall in Ebernhahn, after a thorough remodelling, was given the name Place Marolles as an expression of the partnership. Village life Ebernhahn is well known far beyond the Westerwald for its roughly 30 established firms and its many clubs, among them the nationally and internationally distinguished men's singing club Thalia, founded in 1880, the music club, founded in 1913, the Maria Empf√§ngnis church choir, established in 1949 and the Wanderfreunde Ebernhahn (‚ÄúEbernhahn Hiking Friends‚Äù), which came into being in 1980. The MGV \\"Thalia\\" gives its own concert every year on the Saturday before Palm Sunday at which other renowned choirs and ensembles are guests. Moreover, the MGV \\"Thalia\\" takes part in at least one important choir contest each year. The music club vies every autumn with three other orchestras in a collective concert held at a different place each time. Each year, on the last weekend before the summer holidays, the music club gives an open-air serenade at the old village linden in the middle of the community. The church choir takes on the creation of the church year's high points, particularly at Easter, Corpus Christi and Christmas. Every summer there is an evening song event, likewise at the old village linden. All three musical clubs also hold combined church concerts in a perennial, loose cycle. The Wanderfreunde are represented weekly, nationally, and sometimes internationally, at many hiking events. Each year in August, the Wanderfreunde hold their own Internationale Volkswanderung. Furthermore, the Wanderfreunde invite everyone to an Advent Hike in December, linked every other year with the Krippenwanderung (‚ÄúManger Hike‚Äù), when under festive lighting, there are many Christmas mangers to be seen.

Geography Location The community lies in the Westerwald between Montabaur and Westerburg. Surrounded by a well cared-for and charming landscape, Elbingen lies in the middle of a wooded area with many hiking and cycling trails. The community belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wallmerod, a kind of collective municipality. History In 1383, Elbingen had its first documentary mention as Elmennyngen and once lay in the area of the Niederlahngau, the lordly domain of the Counts of Nassau. The name can be traced to the ancient name Alaman, leading to the conclusion that there was an earlier Germanic settlement here. Only later did the name Elbingen come to be associated with the Elb, the important Westerwald river that runs through the municipal area. In a document from 1383, Friedrich von Elmennyngen is named; however, no coat of arms from this middle-noble family has been handed down. Other noble families, such as von Hattert, von Reifenberg (arms red and silver) and von Dehrn had holdings here. The long era in which the House of Nassau held sway was interrupted in 1564 when the parish of Salz, and thereby Elbingen, passed to the Electorate of Trier. By 1806, however, Elbingen passed back to Nassau and belonged until 1866 to the Duchy of Nassau, and thereafter to the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The civic arms bear a golden lion armed and langued gules (ie with red claws and tongue) on a blue field, which was the charge seen on the arms borne by the Counts of Nassau. This refers to the great span of time when the community was under Nassau‚Äôs sway. Besides the village itself, an oilmill on the K√§lberbach is mentioned in 1739, which by 1786 was somewhat inexplicably named Spie√üm√ºhle (‚ÄúSpear Mill‚Äù), but it still stands below the village now and is used as a dwelling. The Spie√üm√ºhle is symbolically represented in the arms by the red half waterwheel in silver. Red and silver are the tinctures of the Electorate of Trier and thus they bear witness to Elbingen‚Äôs time in the ‚ÄúTrierschland‚Äù. The silver-blue wavy fesses stand for the Elbbach, the K√§lberbach and the reservoir built in 1967, part of which covers Elbingen‚Äôs municipal area, making a great recreation area on the Elbingen shore. Elbingen‚Äôs municipal area has always been characterized by agriculture, which for a long time was the inhabitants‚Äô main source of earnings. The waterwheel is therefore also a symbol for agriculture, whose produce was processed at the mill. Besides a small amount of basalt and brown coal mining, clay bricks were also fired in the 19th century. At the same time, Elbingers would fire their stoneware, such as jugs and so forth for household use. From this custom arose the name Elwinger Kriielcher, which Elbingers have kept to this day and bear with pride. This is symbolized by the silver jug in the Nassau lion‚Äôs paws. The community was once united with M√§hren as of 1969, and the amalgamation bore the name Elbingen-M√§hren. It was, however, dissolved again in 1993. Economy and infrastructure The village, in which roughly 310 people live today, has retained its individual character in a cared-for and neighbourly atmosphere, underscored by a successful village renewal project with much greenery. Particularly worthy of note is the newly remodelled village square around the bakehouse and the old timber-frame middle-class house (B√ºrgerhaus) that is enjoyed by families for its ‚Äúhomely appearance‚Äù. On the community limits bordering Hahn am See lies a private lake in the woods with a camping ground and trailer park.

Geography Location The community lies in the Westerwald between Limburg and Siegen. The river Nister, which is within the Sieg‚Äôs drainage basin, flows from east to west through the municipal area. Fehl-Ritzhausen belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Marienberg, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. History Fehl-Ritzhausen celebrated the 700th jubilee of its existence from 27 to 29 April 2007. The constituent community of Fehl had its first documentary mention on 6 January 1307 when Count Heinrich III of Nassau-Siegen and his wife Adelheid confirmed the existing revenue for the abbot and convent of the Marienstatt Cistercian Monastery in Velde (=Fehl) and Graynsiven (=Gro√üseifen). The first mention by name of Roitzhusen comes from 27 October 1340; in his will, the knight Eberhard Daube von Selbach bequeathed to his widow Sophia a pension out of the village tithes that were owed him. Both communities‚Äô origins stretch, if anything, much further back into time, as the namings in the documents suggest. The placename ending ‚Äìhausen hints at a possible founding in the 9th or 10th century. The Ritz ‚Äì earlier also Roitz ‚Äì part of the name most likely comes from Rode (‚Äúclearing‚Äù in German), which was often used as a word from the 9th to 12th centuries to describe settlements established on cleared woodland. Even older is Fehl. The name comes from the German word Feld (‚Äúfield‚Äù), a word customarily used in the 6th century to describe settlements built on open land (‚ÄúGefilde‚Äù) or next to waterways. Indeed, Fehl‚Äôs inhabitants did settle on a waterway ‚Äì the river Nister ‚Äì whereas to the north, the Ritzhauseners lived under the Scheidchen castle‚Äôs protection, which shielded them from, among other things, the northwest wind which brought snow. Belonging to the parish of Marienberg, 4 households were counted in Fehl in 1589 and 8 in Ritzhausen with all together some 50 persons. Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the population had sunk to 18. Fehl and Ritzhausen were first mentioned as two communities belonging together in 1592. In 1732, separate naming appears again, before an administrative reform within the County of Nassau-Beilstein once again united the two. Indeed, the Handbuch der Geographie und Statistik des Herzogthums Nassau from 1823 speaks explicitly of Fehl und Ritzhausen as zwei D√∂rfern, but nevertheless characterizes the two as a double community, listing their population figures as one ‚Äì 213 Seelen (‚Äúsouls‚Äù). When brown coal pits opened in H√∂hn in 1746 and four years later in Stockhausen, Fehl-Ritzhauseners were offered another way to earn an income. Their home village was connected to the postal network in 1775, leading immediately to postal coaches and messengers making the village a base. Further important links to a broader civilization came with the community‚Äôs electrification in 1917 and, ten years earlier, the railway link through the Westerwaldquerbahn, which brought along with it a station in 1906-1907. The branchline from Fehl-Ritzhausen to Bad Marienberg, however, was abandoned in 1971. Exactly ten years later came the end for the Westerburg‚Äì(Fehl- Ritzhausen)‚ÄìRennerod stretch of the line. Since then, regular bus traffic has kept the community linked with the surrounding area. Fehl-Ritzhausen managed to keep itself mostly unscathed by the destruction wrought by the Second World War. In late 1944 and early 1945, however, there were three Allied air raids on the community, their main target being the railway station. The enemy‚Äôs bombs only caused slight damage, and there was no loss of life among the officially reported 521 inhabitants (as of 1939). All the more painful was the loss of 38 men from Fehl-Ritzhausen, who as Wehrmacht soldiers fell in battle or went missing. Already in the First World War, the community had paid a high price in blood, losing 22 men. Some local families, such as Neeb, Schell, Sch√ºrg, Stalp and Steup were struck a second time in the Second World War. Owing to local men‚Äôs induction into the forces, there was a dearth of workers, and in both world wars, French and Russian prisoners of war were brought in to do labour. On 27 March 1945, the community was occupied by United States troops without resistance.

The development of the Maltese language in a country far removed from Malta continued, in an environment that maintained a sense of origin and culture. It is essential to look to the history of this development in order to appreciate the Maltese dialect spoken in Australia. History of Maltese emigrants to Australia As a sailor nation, the Maltese began to travel many centuries ago. Many Maltese found work in the navy of the Order of St. John. Pre-dating this, the Maltese people were known as good sailors in the Mediterranean region. However, modern forms of transportation and sudden economic changes prompted mass emigration from Malta. In 1882 Australia welcomed the first official group of immigrants from Malta, 8 immigrants sent there as part of an experiment conducted by the Maltese Imperial Government. 40 years after that first emigration to Australia, emigration began on a larger scale. Between 1911 and 1939 6,000 Maltese people emigrated to Australia and in the ten years between 1940 and 1949 numbers rose to 8,000. In the twenty years after 1949 Australia welcomed over 61,000 emigrants. 1956 saw 10,300 emigrants from Malta enter Australia. Later numbers of emigrants decreased until, in the early 1970s, the Australian authorities closed the doors for all European emigrants. Origins of a new Maltese dialect The first trace of a change in the Maltese language in Australia was evidenced in 1929 with the publication of Charles Parnis's books, the first Maltese journalist in Australia. These writings included various expressions and vocabulary not included in standard Maltese. This documentation of an Australian-Maltese dialect in journals suggest that its origins go back before 1929. After these first publications in Maltese by Charles Parnis and some other writers who wrote from 1929 to 1935, there was a pause in work published by Australian-Maltese authors, due to the Second World War. Publication of Australian-Maltese works resumed (in the Maltese language) after 1949, in Melbourne. Some Maltralian Characteristics The Maltese language in Australia developed a different style from the Standard Maltese, in part due to the Australian social environment. Maltralian divergences from standard Maltese include: *The word blaƒ°a (bludger), a masculine and feminine noun, with the verb ibblaƒ°ƒ°ja, neither of which occur in Standard Maltese. *Maltese words developed a new format like iddmanda (to demand) from the Maltese word tiddomanda. *Words like kejn/kejna rather than kannamieli or blinka (blinker) but not the Standard indikejter (indicator). *Standard Maltese uses appoƒ°ƒ°a for help, but Maltralian uses rifed. *Standard Maltese uses bank for bank, but Maltralian uses mislef. *There is a lack of Italian influence in the Maltralian dialect, unlike Standard Maltese, for example ƒãaw (bye) is not used but saƒßƒßa is, awguri is not used but nifraƒßlek or nixtieqlek ir-risq are. However, these Semitic expressions are still present in Standard Maltese. *For futbol (football) in Maltralian use soker, not traditionally used in Standard Maltese. *The plural of dar (home) in Maltese is djar (homes) but in Maltralian the plural of dar is djars, darsijiet or djarsijiet. For buttuna (button) the Standard plural buttuni in not used, in favour of btaten. Tifla (girl) does not take the Standard plural bniet but tifliet. *The word 'cheap' in Maltese is irƒßis (cheap) and irƒßas (cheaper), but in Maltralian iƒãep and iƒãjep are used.

Geography Location Gem√ºnden lies east of Westerburg, in a valley setting shielded by mountains to the north and east but wide open to the south. In the community, the three brooks Holzbach, Elbbach and Schafbach flow together. Since 1972 it has belonged to what was then the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Westerburg, a kind of collective municipality. Neighbouring communities Gem√ºnden is surrounded by Winnen in the north, Westerburg in the northwest, Willmenrod and Berzhahn in the southwest, Langendernbach in the southeast and Seck and Irmtraut in the east. The closest bigger cities are Limburg in the south and Montabaur in the north. History In 879, Gem√ºnden had its first documentary mention. In this year, the monastery of St. Severus, built by Count Gebhard, was consecrated. Unfortunately, the endowment document has been lost. Only a copy from 1333 still exists. An idea of the event‚Äôs great political importance was shown by King Ludwig III, Charlemagne‚Äôs great- grandson, who was on hand for the occasion. The monastery owned great estates, which are said to have reached all the way to the Rhine. In the endowment document, some of the surrounding communities were furthermore transferred to the monastery. Until the end of the 12th century, the monastery‚Äôs and its estates‚Äô importance grew. Only with the rise in power of the V√∂gte (sing. Vogt ‚Äì secular protectors) in the 13th century did the monastery‚Äôs power begin to wane. In 1336, Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian empowered the monastery V√∂gte, whose seat was in Westerburg, by appointing them to hold the office of Vogt at Gem√ºnden. The monastery thereby virtually lost its independence. In 1430 and 1440, fires are said to have badly damaged the monastery church. In 1566, the monastery Vogt Reinhard II ordered the introduction of the Reformation into Gem√ºnden. In 1580 came the first parson to Gem√ºnden. Owing, however, to disagreements between the Lords of Westerburg and the Lords of Wied-Runkel, the latter‚Äôs armed forces attacked Gem√ºnden later in the same year. Before this disagreement could be settled for good in 1599, there was a further attack in 1597. The institution of the monastery was swept away before 1600. Politics Community council The council is made up of 17 council members, including the extraofficial mayor (B√ºrgermeister), who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 7 June 2009.

Although best known by many for his songwriting for Stax Records in the 1960s and 1970s, some of his own releases from the 1960s are considered classics on the Northern Soul scene. Many of the songs he wrote have become contemporary classics. Life Banks was born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, and at the age of 16 formed the Soul Consolidators gospel group which toured around the southern states, often performing his own material. After military service, he returned to Memphis in 1964, and started a singing career with the small Genie label where he met Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Soon, Stax founder Estelle Axton hired him to work at the record shop attached to the company's Satellite Studios, where he stayed for three years, also recording for the Minit label.. His three consecutive releases \\"A Lot of Love\\" (often covered as \\"Ain't That a Lot of Love\\") and \\"60 Minutes of Your Love\\" (both 1966) and \\"Hooked By Love \\" (1967) all found success in England, eventually becoming Northern Soul classics. \\"A Lot of Love\\" formed the musical basis of the Spencer Davis Group hit single \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" released in October 1966. Jim Stewart at Stax refused to give Banks a contract as a singer, but eventually Stax did give him a songwriting contract. He began working with co-writer Allen Jones, placing songs with Johnnie Taylor and Sam and Dave, and also writing \\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\", later a UK hit for Elvis Costello. Banks had greater success with the Staple Singers, writing their first Stax single \\"Long Walk to DC\\", and then some of their biggest hits including \\"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\\". In 1968, he formed a songwriting trio with Bettye Crutcher and Raymond Jackson, calling themselves We Three. Their first song was \\"Who's Making Love\\", which was recorded by Johnnie Taylor and became a # 3 pop hit and # 1 R&B; hit, Stax's biggest. Banks also wrote, with Jackson and Carl Hampton, \\"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\\", a song first recorded by The Emotions which became a hit when recorded by Luther Ingram, and later recorded by Isaac Hayes and Millie Jackson and many other singers, including Barbara Mandrell, Rod Stewart and Cassandra Wilson. Banks' twin brother James also worked for Stax, co- writing the company's last big hit, Shirley Brown's \\"Woman to Woman\\". After Stax folded, Homer Banks and Carl Hampton signed a publishing deal with A&M; Records and moved to California, where they continued to write but with less success. In 1977, as Banks and Hampton, they recorded the album Passport to Ecstasy for Warner Bros. Records. In the 1980s, Banks formed the Two's Company recording company with Lester Snell, which released albums by J. Blackfoot and Ann Hines. In 1983, Banks, Reginald Jenkins and Chuck Brooks formed Sound Town Records, Inc. and released the top twenty album on J. Blackfoot titled City Slicker. It included the R&B; top five single \\"Taxi\\" and also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, which he wrote and produced with Chuck Brooks. Banks and Brooks also produced the Intimate Storm album on the Sound Town Records label, which included four singles that made the Billboard R&B; chart. All of these songs were produced for World Production Company formed and owned by Banks, Reginald (Reggie) Jenkins and Chuck Brooks. Homer Banks died in Memphis of cancer, aged 61. Compositions With Carl Hampton, he co-wrote \\"I've Got a Feeling (We'll Be Seeing Each Other Again)\\", which was recorded by Al Wilson. The song was produced by Marc Gordon and arranged by H.B. Barnum. The B-side \\"Be Concerned\\" was produced by Herbert Santifer. The record made it to number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July 26, 1976.

It is one of two communities named Zehnhausen in the Westerwaldkreis, the other being Zehnhausen bei Wallmerod. Geography Location Zehnhausen lies on the basalt knoll of the High Westerwald on an average elevation of more than 530 m above sea level. The community lies right on Bundesstra√üe 54, the ‚ÄúMainz Road‚Äù, a mediaeval trade road. It comes from Mainz and leads to Siegen. The road, however, had hardly any influence on the community's development. Zehnhausen bei Rennerod belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Rennerod, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. History The placename with the ending ‚Äìhausen would seem to indicate that the community arose at the time of the greatest wave of Frankish settlement in the Westerwald from the 6th century to the 11th. Zehnhausen has for uncounted years belonged to the parish of Emmerichenhain, which since the Reformation has been Evangelical. For centuries the community belonged to the House of Nassau. In 1335, Zehnhausen had its first documentary mention, when the community was called Zhenhusen. It is believed that in the field known as Altzehnhausen ‚Äì alt is German for ‚Äúold‚Äù ‚Äì which lies roughly 1.2 km southwest of today's community, is where the community's core was once to be found. Wall remains unearthed there, however, might have been field walls. The place once known as K√∂nigshub ‚Äì or about 1440 Konigshuse ‚Äì roughly 1 km to the north, formed along with Zehnhausen one community until 1738. The field name Kindschue still shows today where the now forsaken village lay. In 1635 there were only two utterly impoverished households left in Zehnhausen, and in 1643 there were 16 inhabitants. In the summer of 1658, sixteen houses burnt to the ground within one hour. In 1660, 36 people in 6 families were counted in the community; in 1782 it was 169, and in 1807, 33 families with all together 168 people lived in the community. In 1736, a branch school was first mentioned and in 1784, the first schoolhouse of the community's own was built. This schoolhouse was used until the late 1960s. All eight grades were taught in one classroom. In June 1796, the inhabitants fled Zehnhausen for Nenderoth into the Kreuzberg Forest by way of Johannisburg before advancing French soldiers, who were moving forth from Hachenburg into the Westerwald to Emmerichenhain. There, a few children were even born. Politics Community council The council is made up of 8 council members who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 13 June 2004. Economy and infrastructure Trade and tourism offer only a handful of jobs. Agriculture is nowadays only practised as a sideline. As always, most working people commute to jobs in the surrounding area. Village life In 1964, the community won a silver medal in the special class in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village ought to be lovelier‚Äù). The community has a singing club and a sport club (SV Adler) with its own sporting ground and sport hall. For children, a playground was built back in the 1960s. In the Dorfgemeinschaftshaus (‚Äúvillage community house‚Äù), the former bakehouse, is also found the fire brigade house. Yearly, a village and well festival is held. Newly laid out hiking paths enhance the community's attractiveness. Transport Right near the community, Bundesstra√üen 54, linking Limburg an der Lahn with Siegen, and 414, leading from Hohenroth to Hachenburg, cross each other.

Description It grows as an erect shrub from 20 centimetres to 1.5 metres high, consisting of numerous stems up to 70 centimetres long, emerging from an underground lignotuber. Leaves are leathery, up to 10 centimetres long, and bifurcate into lobes up to three times. They extend well up the stems. Flowers occur in a panicle atop a scape up to 1.5 metres high. Taxonomy Stirlingia latifolia was first published by Robert Brown in 1830 under the name Simsia latifolia. It was later discovered that the generic name Simsia, published by Brown in 1810, was illegitimate, as it had already been published in 1807 for a genus of Asteraceae. A new generic name, Stirlingia, was published in 1838, but the transfer of the species published under Simsia was overlooked at first. Simsia latifolia would not be transferred into Stirlingia until 1841, when Ernst Steudel published Stirlingia latifolia (R.Br.) Steud. Meanwhile, John Lindley had published Stirlingia paniculata in his 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony; this would later be shown to be a synonym of S. latifolia. An attempt was later made to reinstate the name Simsia; resulting in its use by Carl Ostenfeld in 1921 when he published a purported variety, Simsia latifolia var. gracilis. This attempt was later rejected. In 1995, Alex George published a thorough treatment of the Stirlingia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. He reduced numerous names to synonymy, including declaring both S. paniculata and variety gracilis to be taxonomically indistinguishable from S. latifolia itself, and therefore synonymous. No infrageneric arrangement has been proffered for the genus, but George placed the species close to S. anethifolia. It has no recognised subspecies or varieties. The common name blueboy refers to the fact that wall plaster made using sand taken from where S. latifolia occurs turns blue. Distribution and habitat It occurs throughout western parts of Western Australia's Southwest Botanical Province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Albany. In many areas it is very common. It grows in deep sand, amongst heath, shrubland and woodland. Ecology The species is not considered threatened.

In the arms are a red watchtower on a silver background, and a golden lion rampant on a blue background. The watchtower still stands today in Heiligenroth. Formerly it stood alone, with a small church beside it. Only in 1782 was the church that stands today built onto the Romanesque tower. At that time, the tower served a defensive function, hence the loopholes, and it belonged until 1975 to the community, while the church belonged to the parish. It was only then that the tower's ownership passed to the parish. The choice of Nassau tinctures has not as much to do with the short political connection with the Duchy of Nassau (1802‚Äì1866) as it has to do with Heiligenroth's location, which is in the middle of the Nassauer Land.

Meudt passed in 1564 from the County of Diez to the Electorate of Trier, and in 1803 to Nassau. Politics Community council The council is made up of 17 council members, including the extraofficial mayor (B√ºrgermeister), who were elected in a municipal election on 13 June 2004. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\" CDU |FWG |Total |- align=\\"center\\" 2009 |11 |5 |16 seats |} Coat of arms The community's arms were officially conferred on 22 January 1938 and the design is taken from the community seal borne since Nassau times (since 1816), and bears Nassau tinctures. The key stands for the community's patron saint, Peter. Culture and sightseeing Buildings The town hall built in 1596 is the oldest maintained in the Westerwald. Notable is its roof construction with the cambered spire light. Also worth seeing are the Gangolfusbrunnen (spring), which is the Eisenbach's source, and the Jewish cemetery. The Gangolfushalle, newly opened in 2006, offers modern event space for over 500 seating places.

The line formerly included an additional kilometre of track to Gracefield Freight Terminal, where it connected to a network of industrial sidings in nearby Seaview. Currently its only function is to provide access to the Hutt Workshops. The line has been known by several names, including Hutt Park Line (1937), Hutt Industrial Line (1937), Gracefield Branch (1986), Gracefield Industrial Line (2001) and Gracefield Industrial Siding (2006). Its 1937 name led to confusion with the earlier Hutt Park Railway.  History  The Hutt Workshops road enters the fenced workshops yard (left), while the branch line (right) runs along the perimeter of the workshops yard. Planning for the Gracefield Branch was included in surveys done for the Hutt Valley Branch line in 1924 and 1925. The line was intended to serve an area of 80 acres (32 ha) that had been purchased for the establishment of new railway workshops to replace those at Petone and an area at Gracefield intended for industrial development. The line opened on 1 April 1929 and originally had one station, the terminus at Hutt Park. In 1943 the line was extended into Gracefield and a new terminus established there. Following land reclamation in the 1950s & 1960s, an extensive network of sidings was built at Seaview to serve industrial interests, including the Ford Motor Vehicle Assembly Plant; oil terminals for BP, Caltex, Europa and Shell; Pacific Scrap; and the Ministry of Works. Electrification of the Woburn ‚Äì Hutt Park section commenced in 1953 using the 1.5 kV DC overhead line system, coinciding with the electrification of the Wairarapa Line between Wellington and Taita. The catenary was extended slightly in 1959-60 to allow for EMUs running race trains to Hutt Park to use a workshops siding. A further extension of the catenary was opened in 1966 for goods trains to Gracefield Freight Terminal. Though there were no electric trains running on the branch from 1983 following the cessation of the workers' trains to the workshops, and the catenary and related electrification infrastructure were removed in 1990. In 1972 a new Freight Depot was opened at Gracefield to relieve pressure on Lower Hutt Station (now Western Hutt) for small consignments. In 1981 the goods facilities at Lower Hutt Station were closed and the local goods shunts to Lower Hutt ceased. Goods handling was transferred to a new facility at Gracefield. Gracefield Yard was closed on 30 April 2002. The industrial sidings at Seaview were lifted at about this time. Track between the Hutt Workshops and Gracefield has not been used since Gracefield Freight Terminal was closed, and is now mothballed.  Operations  The end of operations on the Gracefield Branch, just before the Parkside Road level crossing. A road- style Stop sign has been used in place of the standard All Trains Stop board. This part of the branch line, just shy of the Elizabeth Street level crossing, was used as a stopping place for the Hutt Workshops workers' trains. From the time the line opened to the 1940s, steam trains were used to convey patrons to race meetings and picnics at the Hutt Park Raceway via Woburn. The race trains that had previously run to Hutt Park on the Hutt Park Railway had ceased operation in 1905. Race trains briefly resumed in the 1960s using DM/D class electric multiple units. These trains initially operated from both Upper Hutt and Wellington to Hutt Park, with the Wellington trains needing to reverse on to the branch at Woburn. Declining patronage led to the service being later reduced to Wellington ‚Äì Hutt Park only, being withdrawn completely in 1965. A twice-daily workers' train between Wellington and the Hutt Workshops conveyed railwaymen to and from work from the 1930s to December 1982, and was the last regular passenger service run on the line. These trains were locomotive- hauled, latterly usually by EW class electrics. The withdrawal of this service marked the end of electric train operations on the branch. Though the motivation for extending the catenary in 1966 to the freight terminal was to allow for electric-hauled freight trains, such services seem to have been infrequent and even quite rare. Prior to the closure of the Gracefield yard, there was a regular shunting service (Q2) from the Gracefield Freight Terminal. The only regular traffic that currently uses the line is the Hutt Workshops shunt (Q4) which normally operates thrice weekly, with occasional special services.

Geography Neighbouring municipalities Leuterod's immediate neighbours are Moschheim in the southeast, √ñtzingen in the northeast, Siershahn in the west and Wirges in the southwest. Location Together with the first two municipalities named above, Leuterod borders in the east on the Malberg, whose elevation of 422 m above sea level makes it the most notable feature on the landscape north of Montabaur. The river Aubach divides the municipality into two zones (Bereiche in German): the Unterdorf (‚ÄúLower Village‚Äù) and the Insel (‚ÄúIsland‚Äù). The municipality belongs to the Wirges Verbandsgemeinde (the municipal association of Wirges). Constituent municipalities Leuterod's Ortsteile are Leuterod and Hosten. History Leuterod's history reaches very far back. Finds on the Malberg confirm the existence of a Celtic hill fort (a place of worship) built there sometime between 800 and 600 BC. In 1362, Leuterod had its first documentary mention as Wendel de lutereide. Somewhat earlier, in 1311, the outlying centre of Hosten had been mentioned as Hovesteden. Leuterod and Hosten lay at this time in the parish of Montabaur, whereby the Lords of St. Florin in Koblenz held the tithing rights. In 1563, 12 ‚Äúhearths‚Äù (Feuerst√§tten, that is to say, families) were counted in Leuterod. One hundred and twenty years later, owing to the frightful aftermath of the Thirty Years' War, there was only one left. According to sagas, the municipality was utterly destroyed in this time and then built once more on a different spot. The Altendorfer Weg, according to the saga, is supposedly the road to the village's former site. Until 1803, Leuterod belonged to the Electorate of Trier, when it passed to the Duchy of Nassau, and thereby also to Prussia in 1866. Moreover, worth mentioning is that already by 1563, an hereditary mill (gristmill) was mentioned in the municipality.

Geography Location Hillscheid lies northeast of Koblenz on the edge of the Nassau Nature Park. The community belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of H√∂hr- Grenzhausen, a kind of collective municipality. History Many finds in the area of the village meadows show that there were already Celtic settlers here in Hallstatt and La T√®ne times. With the building of the limes came the Romans. They built not only walls, moats and watchtowers, whose traces can still sometimes still be made out, but also a small fort, whose outer foundations, however, may now only be viewed in reconstruction. It is assumed that the community of Hillscheid came into being sometime between 959 and 994. The community's first documentary mention, as Hiensceit, appears in a document uttered by Archbishop of Trier Ludolf (994-1008) about the year 1000. At the request of Abbess Mathilde zu Essen (974-1011), daughter of Swabian duke Liudolf and granddaughter of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor and Swabian duke Hermann I, who himself was Count of the Engersgau and lord of a great area around Montabaur, the Archbishop of Trier Ludolf transferred to St. Florin's Monastery at Koblenz tithing rights to Hana (H√∂hn), Hiensceit (Hillscheid), Mannechenrot (Mangeroth, now abandoned) and Agerin (Nieder√§hren), and in return exchanged Aschebach (Eschelbach). Hillscheid, however, was not in the monastery‚Äôs hands for long. Vallendar was the mother church for the surrounding area and thereby also for Hillscheid and places nearby. Hillscheid belonged, along with Vallendar to the Engersgau, which had its first documentary mention in 773. It was co√´xtensive with the Deanery of Engers, to which Vallendar with Hillscheid and the parish's other communities belonged. Near Hillscheid lay the two now forsaken villages of Cudilbach (K√ºhlbach) and Felderhusen (Pfarrhausen). They found their place in Hillscheid's coat of arms, represented by two jugs. Hillscheid itself was largely destroyed in the Thirty Years' War, recovering rather quickly, however, and from 1683, it had a chapel. It only remained part of the parish of Vallendar until 1812. For the most part, Vallendar had two lords: Sayn-Wittgenstein and the Electorate of Trier. Once France had conquered the areas on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank and the Electorate of Trier had been beaten, the Electorate‚Äôs former territories on the Rhine‚Äôs right bank, and thereby also Vallendar and Hillscheid, passed under Napoleon to the Duchy of Nassau-Weilburg in 1803 as a result of the so- called Reichsdeputationshauptschluss. After Napoleon was overthrown, Vallendar became Prussian with the creation of the Rhine Province, whereas Hillscheid and H√∂hr near Nassau remained in the Duchy of Nassau and were assigned to the Amt of Montabaur. After Prussia‚Äôs conquest and occupation of the Duchy of Nassau, Hillscheid became part of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, and in 1867, through restructuring of authority, part of the new Unterwesterwaldkreis (district). In the Second World War, Hillscheid was mostly spared any great war damage, although there was a rocket launching site near Hillscheid (Hillscheider Stock) from which many V-2 rockets were launched. Furthermore, artillery and flak units were stationed in Hillscheid. Late in the war, these engaged in a heavy firefight with the US artillery near Koblenz, resulting in several deaths in Hillscheid. In 1946, the Unterwesterwaldkreis and along with it the community of Hillscheid were assigned to the new Bundesland of Rhineland-Palatinate, belonging at first to the Regierungsbezirk of Montabaur. Through its dissolution in 1968, administrative reform in 1971 and district reform in 1974, Hillscheid is today part of the Verbandsgemeinde of H√∂hr-Grenzhausen within the Westerwaldkreis, itself formed out of the old districts of the Unterwesterwaldkreis and the Oberwesterwaldkreis.

Geography Location The community lies in the Westerwald between Koblenz and Siegen. A local tourist draw is the community's favourable location in the Sayn-Isenburg-Grenzau ‚Äúcastle triangle‚Äù. Nauort belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Ransbach-Baumbach, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. Neighbouring communities Nauort's immediate neighbours are the smaller Ortsgemeinden Caan (1 km away), Sessenbach (2 km) and Alsbach (2 km) as well as Bendorf‚Äôs outlying centre of Stromberg (2 km). History The name ‚ÄúNauort‚Äù developed by way of ‚ÄúNaurodt‚Äù (16th century) from ‚ÄúNuenrohde‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúnew clearing‚Äù, which had its first documentary mention in 1279. In the 20th century, besides agriculture, the local pumice industry was one of the main income sources for Nauorters. Benefits were also drawn from the community's membership in the Kannenb√§ckerland (\\"Jug Bakers‚Äô Land\\") around the ceramics production centre of H√∂hr-Grenzhausen. Religion The Catholic parish, which belongs to the Bishopric of Limburg, has as its church patron John the Baptist. Politics Community council The council is made up of 17 council members, including the extraofficial mayor (B√ºrgermeister), who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 25 May 2014. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\" CDU |FWG |Total |- align=\\"center\\" 2014 |10 |6 |16 seats |} Coat of arms The community's arms are based on the following points: The community of Nauort, mentioned in a document in 1279, lies in the former Engersgau and belonged to the lordly domain of Isenburg-Grenzau. Once the Lower Isenburg line died out, the community passed to the Electorate of Trier in 1664, and then in 1803 to Nassau-Weilburg. From 1806 it belonged to the Duchy of Nassau. In 1866 it passed to Prussia and became part of the province of Hesse-Nassau. Nauort lies in the landscape within the Sayn- Isenburg-Grenzau triangle between the charming valleys of the Saynbach and Brexbach on a wooded high plateau. The broad bend sinister wavy seen in the arms stands with the two blue fields of the same size, each with two silver wavy bendlets, for the two valleys with the Saynbach and Brexbach. Widespread pumice deposits from volcanic time gave rise to a pumice industry, which for a long time was an income earner for the community's inhabitants. The pumice, with its naturally yellow colour is represented in the arms by the gold (yellow) colour of the middle field inside the broad bend, also of the same size. Besides the customary agriculture, the jug firer's trade was an income earner and livelihood for Nauorters well into the 19th century. The craft is documented in the civic arms by the typical jug with its blue tincture. Finally, the field tinctures blue and gold recall Nassau's armorial tinctures, Nauort having belonged to this territory for a long time, as earlier mentioned. Today, Nauort is a community with a good location for living and economic development in the Verbandsgemeinde of Ransbach-Baumbach in the Westerwaldkreis. Nauort's coat of arms is thereby based in its history, crafts and landscape.

There is a nature reserve called Rotuz in the easter part of the village.  History  It was first mentioned in a written document in 1568 as Zeleny Chyb. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia.

It is located within the federal division of Port Adelaide and the state electoral district of Port Adelaide.  Multi-Function Polis  Gillman was intended to be the site of the Multi-Function Polis, a joint project by the Australian and Japanese Governments in the late 1980s and 1990s. Started in 1987 by the Hawke Government, the MFP was intended to be a high-tech industry and technology hub with local laws similar to those found in Special Economic Zones around the world today. Protests from the local community and controversy over the proposed partnership with Japan led to the collapse of the project, which later was re-purposed into Technology Park and Mawson Lakes nearby. Motorsport Gillman has been the home of Motorcycle Speedway in Adelaide since 1981 when the North Arm Speedway opened. The speedway, located on the Grand Trunkway, operated from 1981 until its forced closure in 1997. Since 1998 it has been the home of a larger motorcycle speedway venue, the long Gillman Speedway located on Wilkins Road.

Journal of the Historical Society of South Australia, Nr. 35, 2007.  Gillman Controversy  In June 2013, the Weatherill State Government received a proposal from Adelaide Capital Partners (ACP) to purchase of Gillman land for $135 million over three instalments, which was approved in December 2013 and supposed to create 6000 jobs. However, the process was later criticised by the state Opposition and subsequently the Supreme Court of South Australia who ruled the deal 'unlawful, irrational and in disregard of commercial principles', but said the contract was valid despite criticising the government's failure to put the land to public tender. A potential High Court action was resolved in an out-of-court deal, with South Australian Attorney General John Rau confirming the parties settled, with the government paying legal costs incurred by all parties, estimated to be no more than $2.2 million. In November 2016, ACP failed to make payment, and the government was forced to pay the Adelaide City Council $20 million for land it purchased as part of the original deal. The government has since sold part of the property to Veolia for use as a waste-to-energy plant, although the vast majority remains in government hands.

The motorway will connect the Serbian capital of Belgrade and Bar, Montenegro's main seaport. Italy, Montenegro and Serbia are lobbying to list the route with Pan-European corridors, and it is frequently referred to as part of proposed Corridor XI, or 4B ‚Äì an envisioned ferry/motorway corridor linking Bari, Bar, Belgrade and Bucharest. From the Serbian side, the road's construction started in 2012 on a 40.3 kilometers-long section Ljig‚ÄîPreljina on northern part of the route, which was put into service in 2016. From the Montenegrin side, the road's construction began on May 11, 2015. Serbian section As the A1 motorway towards Skopje at the European route E75 approached completion in late 2010s, public attention has shifted towards the future highway connecting the Belgrade with Montenegro, designated as A2. The motorway is envisioned as a local link as much as a transit link, connecting southwestern Serbia with Belgrade and the European road network. Route description Serbian section of the motorway can be roughly divided into two sections: Belgrade to Po≈æega and Po≈æega to Boljare, at the state border of Serbia and Montenegro. The section of the road between Belgrade and Po≈æega is 151.63 kilometers long and it will pass through the Serbian towns and municipalities of Ostru≈ænica, Umka, Obrenovac, Ub, Lajkovac, Ljig, Takovo, Preljina (in the municipality of ƒåaƒçak) and Po≈æega. Total worth of the Belgrade‚ÄìPreljina section is estimated to be at 889.8 million euros, and because of favorable terrain it will be the cheapest section of the motorway. The southern section of the road from Po≈æega to Boljare will cost at least 1.5 billion euros, for approximately . The exact route of this section has not yet been determined. Current progress In Serbia, efforts to start the construction of the long section between Belgrade and Po≈æega began in 2008, when a concession contract was signed with and FCC Construction. Yet, Alpine and the Government of Serbia agreed to cancel the contract in August 2008. In 2010, consortium of Serbian construction companies won the bidding for building of 12,5 km section between Ub and Lajkovac. On July 30, 2010, the work began and the construction is still underway. In August 2019 complete section of 103 km from Obrenovac to Preljina was open to traffic. Section from Obrenovac to Surƒçin should be done by the end of 2019 and connection from New Belgrade to Surƒçin by 2022. Section Preljina‚ÄîPo≈æega is section in construction. The last section of A2 motorway is a section from Po≈æega to border with Montenegro near Boljare. This section will be more than 100 kilometers long, and the exact route is being chosen. Montenegrin section Corridors of future motorways in Montenegro. Bar-Boljare motorway is marked in red The Montenegrin part of motorway is known as the Bar-Boljare motorway. It will be 164 km long, and by far the most expensive one, with an estimated cost of around 2 billion euros. The rugged mountainous terrain is an engineering challenge, with 50 tunnels and 95 bridges and viaducts planned along the section. Route description The Montenegrin part is to be built in three phases: * (Bar) ƒêurmani ‚Äì Sozina tunnel ‚Äì Virpazar ‚Äì Bistrica ‚Äì ≈†teke ‚Äì ƒÜafa ‚Äì Tolo≈°ko polje ‚Äì (Podgorica) Smokovac: this is the southernmost section of the motorway, that will link the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica with the main seaport in Bar. Potential investors, such as EBRD and EIB, are suggesting that this section should be built first, as it will likely have the highest traffic volume following completion. The planned length of this section is 51 km. * (Podgorica) Smokovac ‚Äì Bioƒçe ‚Äì Pelev Brijeg ‚Äì Lijeva Rijeka ‚Äì Veru≈°a ‚Äì Mate≈°evo: this middle section of the motorway is considered a priority, because of its significance as a link between Podgorica and northern Montenegro. The current road link (E65), carved into the Moraƒça canyon, is a curvy mountainous road, considered dangerous during the winter, and is a bottleneck in Montenegrin road network. Thus, building this section first is a requirement in bidding documents presented by the Montenegrin Government. This section will have a length of 40 km, and is by far the most expensive section of the motorway, with a cost per kilometer of motorway estimated to be higher than ‚Ç¨20 million. * Mate≈°evo ‚Äì Andrijevica ‚Äì Berane ‚Äì Crnƒça ‚Äì Boljare: this northernmost section of the motorway is likely to be completed only after progress is made on the Serbian section of the motorway south of Po≈æega. The planned length of this section is 73 km. Current progress The project is currently in construction bidding phase, and is devised as a public-private partnership. A general contractor that signs the contract with the Government of Montenegro is to finance the construction of the motorway, and conduct maintenance and collect toll fees and other incomes for a period of 30 years after completion. During that 30-year period, Government of Montenegro will pay off its share of financing through annuities. The bidding offers were reviewed in March 2009, and the top bid came from the Croatian consortium, led by the company of Konstruktor. This was followed by signing of contract document, and announcing of the beginning of construction works in June 2009. The official construction works opening ceremony happened on October 15, 2009, in the village of Gornje Mrke north of Podgorica, attended by the Prime Ministers of Montenegro (Milo ƒêukanoviƒá), Serbia (Mirko Cvetkoviƒá) and Croatia (Jadranka Kosor). However, the Croatian consortium failed to provide necessary bank guarantees in a timely manner, so the contract was cancelled eight months later. The second best rated bidder, a consortium of the Greek company Aktor and the Israeli company Shikun & Binui was called in for negotiations by the Government. After negotiations, it was agreed that Aktor/HCH consortium builds two southern sections of the motorway for a price of 1.575 billion euro. The third and the northernmost section, from Mate≈°evo to Boljare, as well as the small strip across the Lake Skadar, were to be the subject of further negotiations. However, the Greek-Israeli consortium also failed to provide bank guarantees, so the negotiations between the consortium and the Government of Montenegro were ended in December 2010. The Government of Montenegro began to explore financing options for motorway construction, including negotiations with Chinese investors. The possibility of China Road and Bridge Group and China Poly Group Corporation building the road, with the financial backing of Exim Bank of China, is now mentioned in the Montenegrin media. In January 2011, the Montenegrin Minister of Transportation has sent an official letter of invitation to the Poly Group, and the negotiations are currently underway. If the negotiations come through, the terms of building and financing will be established via treaty, thus avoiding the bidding process and discarding the public-private partnership option. In April 2013 discussions were still under way between the Montenegrin government and Chinese parties and an offer of US$1bn of financing by EXIM bank and the selection of a preferred construction consortium was announced in July 2013 and with detailed commercial negotiations underway since. In December 2014 negotiations with Chinese partners have successfully concluded. In May 2015 works on first section in Montenegro, Smokovac‚ÄìUvaƒç‚ÄìMate≈°evo have started, expected to finish within 48 months.

Cors is the Welsh word for \\"bog\\": the site is also known as Tregaron Bog, being near the small town of Tregaron. Cors Caron covers an area of approximately .The Ramsar site is 874 ha. Cors Caron represents the most intact surviving example of a raised bog landscape in the United Kingdom.NBN Species Groups Records at 10km or better About 44 different species groups inhabit the area including various land and aquatic plants, fish, insects, crustaceans, lichen, fungi, terrestrial mammals and birds. History The boardwalk leads across the bog. It is for the use of permit holders only as it leads across a treacherous area. Cors Caron began to be formed 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period. A raised bog of this type develops from a lake or flat marshy area, over either non- acidic or acidic substrates. Over centuries there is a progression from open lake, to marsh and then fen (or on acidic substrates, valley bog), as silt or peat fill the lake. Eventually, peat builds up to a level where the land surface is too flat for ground or surface water to reach the centre of the wetland. Trees in the area that died (in about 3000 BC) and were preserved by the conditions in the bog are being studied by scientists looking for information on the past climate of the area.BBC Cors Caron For many centuries the peat in bogs was cut out and harvested for use as a heating fuel. Many bog ecosystems were completely destroyed by this practice. As a result of international concern, Cors Caron was designated as a national nature reserve in 1955.BBC Wales News: Trees to unlock bog's history Formerly in the ownership of the Trawsgoed Estate, and the Earl of Lisburne, the bog is located in the Cors Caron National Nature Reserve. In 1956, the 7th Earl of Lisburne entered into a management agreement with the Nature Conservancy Council, and the reserve lands were sold to the Countryside Council for Wales in 1986. The estate retains grazing and sporting rights over some of the reserve and adjoining farmland. On 2 September 1992, Cors Caron was put on a list of wetland sites of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands The bog is now maintained by Natural Resources Wales, successor body to the Countryside Council for Wales. General site characteristics *Inland water bodies (standing water, running water) (2%) *Bogs, marshes, water fringed vegetation, ferns (70%) *Humid grassland, mesophile grassland (21%) *Broad-leaved deciduous woodland (7%) Primary habitats (priority) feature The assessment designated the primary feature for the selection of Cors Caron as _active raised bog_ described as: > The Cors Caron sequence of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed > on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the > most intact surviving example in the UK of a raised bog landscape > (macrotope).

Primary species The habitation of otter (Lutra lutra) at Cors Caron was the primary species listed in the assessment. Cors Caron is one of the largest wetland areas in Wales and feeds into the River Teifi. Historically it is a very important site for otters and has been an important source of breeding for the otters of the River Teifi and other catchments such as the rivers Severn and Dyfi. Cors Caron also provides an important amphibian food resource for breeding otters in spring. One of the last UK strongholds of the European Polecat was in this area. Birdlife Among the birdlife which can be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, peregrine falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and hen harrier. There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and water rail. Snipe, red grouse, tree pipit, grasshopper warbler and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and willow warbler nest in the willow scrub. Visitor facilities Visitor facilities at Cors Caron include three car parking areas, accessed from the B4343 road between Tregaron and Pontrhydfendigaid. There is a 3 km circular path using a boardwalk, and a 7 km riverside walk on a raised path. Alongside the reserve is a cycle path using the disused trackway of the former Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railway, which forms part of the Ystwyth Trail. In 2005, construction started on a state-of- the-art bird hide at Cors Caron.BBC:- ¬£80,000 twitchers' haven to open Opened in February 2006, the hide provides a viewing point to observe wildlife, especially birds at close range.

The community is regarded as part of the Kroppach Switzerland (Kroppacher Schweiz), a nature and landscape conservation area characterized by the Gro√üe Nister and Kleine Nister with their narrow valleys and in places steep mountain slopes. The village lies south of the Kleine Nister in a side valley, which has been built up, or is being built up, on both slopes (south slope with the Ley and Sonnenberg, north slope with the Leychen and Hofberg). Streithausen belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Hachenburg, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. Neighbouring communities The municipal area comprises 392 ha in elevations ranging from 230 to 380 m above sea level. It borders in the northeast on Atzelgift‚Äôs and Nister‚Äôs municipal areas.

That same year, Streithausen was chosen as the loveliest village in the Westerwaldkreis. Culture and sightseeing Buildings Worth seeing are various timber-frame houses in the heart of the community, among them the community house Scholtzenhaus, and also the community-owned Marienstatt Abbey with its Gymnasium, brewhouse and bookshop. Regular events There, every year, the locally famous Streitser Kirmes is held, at which traditional customs are still practised today as a conclusion. The Streithausen fair company had its 30-year jubilee in 2005. Economy and infrastructure The community has at its disposal a library, children‚Äôs playgrounds, leisure and sport facilities and an extensive hiking path network with connections to the Kroppach Switzerland. Education The community is the primary school centre for four Ortsgemeinden. Within these four communities (Limbach, Streithausen, Atzelgift and Luckenbach), municipal, cultural and sporting facilities are integrated. As part of this arrangement, the community of Streithausen also keeps a common sport ground and plots of land for possible later collective intentions (for instance a sporthall at the primary school) in the Nasse Heide (‚ÄúWet Heath‚Äù) area. The fairground on district road (Kreisstra√üe) K 20 is used not only by Streithausen but also by the neighbouring community of Atzelgift.

Staudt is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a community belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde ‚Äì in the Westerwaldkreis in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Geography Location The municipal area lies at elevations from 260 to 285 m above sea level. The community lies in the southern Westerwald on the edge of the Montabaur Hollow (Montabaurer Senke) and belongs to the so-called Kannenb√§ckerland (‚ÄúJug Bakers‚Äô Land‚Äù, a small region known for its ceramics industry). Towards its south, Staudt stretches to the 286-metre-high slope of the mountain Am H√§hnchen, whereas from east to west, the community's area spreads out into a 265-metre-high plain. In the north lies the rest of the residential and new-town area in the foothills of the 277-metre-high Kramberg. The highest elevation in the municipal area is the 291-metre-high Fussenacker. Through Staudt flow the Aubach and the Unterbach. Since 1972 the community has belonged to what was then the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Wirges ‚Äì a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì whose seat is in the like-named town. History Old school in Staudt Staudt has existed since the Late Middle Ages. Since days of yore it has belonged to the parish of Wirges, itself originally a daughter parish of the parish of Humbach-Montabaur, although over time it became a parish in its own right. Parish patronage rights and the tithe (a rent) in turn were held by St. Florin's Monastery in Koblenz. The first documentary mention of Stude stemmed from a document from this monastery in 1367. More precisely, the document was about rental paid in grain, oats and chickens within the Bann (an administrative unit) of Montabaur, wherein also lay Staudt. In the Bann of Montabaur, the Archbishop of Trier exercised exclusive power over the inhabitants. The villages were obliged to do labour, that is to say, the people were unfree, counted as ‚Äúgoods‚Äù, and went by any sale or exchange into the new lord's ownership. The Bann was subdivided into smaller administrative zones. Together with six further communities, Staudt ‚Äì no later than 1488 ‚Äì formed the so-called gro√üe Zeche, until further division in 1653. This yielded a new Zeche with Leuterod, Hosten, √ñtzingen and Staudt. This was shortly after the Thirty Years' War ended, which was not without consequences even for Staudt, as the number of families fell from 18 in 1605 to only 9 in 1684. It is assumed that there were even fewer inhabitants at the time of the war's end, as a population directory from 1678 lists only 7 families. Passing armies brought horrors and poverty to the Bann of Montabaur. Many people fled; almost two thirds died. Presumably in the late 17th century, the Bann of Montabaur was split up and a Bann of Wirges came into being (the exact date is unknown), to which Staudt also belonged. The Amt administrator, Court Council Linz reported the following in 1786: From the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 until the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the community ‚Äì at the time fighting on Austria‚Äôs side ‚Äì belonged to the newly founded Duchy of Nassau. Nassau, however, was annexed and became Prussian and at first part of the North German Confederation and then later the German Empire. The community and its inhabitants lived through two world wars. In a bombardment on 18 March 1944, 18 buildings were utterly destroyed. However, not only were these houses long ago rebuilt, but also the community has changed from an agricultural community to one based more on industry and services. Politics Town hall Community council The council is made up of 17 council members, including the extraofficial mayor (B√ºrgermeister), who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 13 June 2004. Economy and infrastructure Clay quarrying As in the area as a whole, there is clay quarrying in Staudt. The biggest company that processes clay and that lies in Staudt is Osmose, which manufactures ceramic products. Transport Staudt is only two kilometres from both the towns of Montabaur and Wirges, as well as the nationally important roads Bundesstra√üe 255 and the A 3 (Cologne- Frankfurt). Limburg an der Lahn and Koblenz are each twenty minutes‚Äô drive away, and Cologne and Frankfurt may be reached in one hour. The InterCityExpress railway station at Montabaur is only two kilometres away; travel time to either Cologne or Frankfurt is only 30 minutes. Staudt as a surname Staudt is quite a common German surname. The origin lies in the fact that when surnames came into being ‚Äì at least as they are known today ‚Äì it was, among other things, customary to assign people to their home towns or villages. Often, occupational descriptions or even nicknames were used. Staudt, however, is without a doubt one of these geographical-origin surnames, meaning that its bearers‚Äô forebears did indeed come from Staudt. Emigration from Germany has also spread the name abroad. In 1367, Staudt cropped up as Stude. In 1388 it was Stut and in 1448 Stude. In 1557, history mentions an Electorate of Trier council named Michael Staudt von Limburg. In the early 18th century, the name's bearers settled on the spelling Staudt. In the early to mid-19th century in America many families changed the surname of Staudt to Stout, which is a phonetic spelling based on the American pronunciation. Ponds To Staudt belong several ponds (Weiher) lying south of the village, namely Schr√§derweiher, Weberweiher, Ochsenheide, Birkenweiher, Fussenweiher and the Morschenweiher, which in droughts becomes nothing more than a muddy pool.

Geography Location The community lies in the Westerwald between Koblenz and Limburg an der Lahn on the edge of the Nassau Nature Park on the boundary with Hesse. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Montabaur, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. Neighbouring communities Niedererbach's neighbours are Obererbach, Westerwaldkreis, Dreikirchen, Nentershausen, G√∂rgeshausen and Elz, Hesse. History Niedererbach parish church In 1291, Niedererbach had its first documentary mention as Erlebach. The document is dated 12 May 1291. In the document a pastor named Friedrich and the parish of Erlebach are mentioned which document a legal transaction with the commander and the Teutonic Knights in Koblenz. The original is kept at the Central Archive of the Teutonic Knights in Vienna. Since 2006, the community of Niedererbach has been in possession of a copy of the document. Niedererbach's first documentary mention 12 May 1291 In 2006 the community celebrated one of the biggest festivals since its beginnings, the one hundredth Kirmes. This most important of village festivals is held each year on the last weekend in August and recalls the consecration of the parish church of St. Katharina in 1906. One part of the tower is considerably older and may come from the time about AD 1200. Before today's church stood here, there was on the same spot a Baroque church built in 1725, about the size of the side nave today. This old church was torn down in 1904, although the tower was left standing. Only the uppermost third was torn down and renewed. In September 1904, excavation work began for the new parish church. On 14 May 1905, the first stone was laid and on 10 August 1905, the topping-out ceremony was held. The framework was completed in December 1905. In May 1906 began the plastering, the window fitting and the interior decoration. On 19 August 1906, the new church building was ceremonially blessed by Bishop Dominikus Willi Since Niedererbachers were once known for making little whistles from willow twigs, they are sometimes still known as Erwocher Peifscher today. Politics Community council The council is made up of 12 council members who were elected in a municipal election on 28 May 2014. In the last direct vote for mayor (Ortsb√ºrgermeister), held on the same day, Gerhard Theis was elected to office as the only candidate for a further four years. Coat of arms The sword and breaking wheel in the community's arms are symbols of the parish church's patronage, namely Saint Catherine (the wheel is also known as a Catherine wheel). The alder sprig refers to the community's name (Erbach = Erlenbach). The wavy parting per pale stands for the community's charming rural location in the Erbach valley. As a token of the former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier, that territory's tinctures have been incorporated into the civic arms.

It is named for the town of Parthenay in the d√©partement of Deux-S√®vres, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of western France. It was formerly a triple-purpose breed, raised for milk, meat and draught work, but is now raised mainly for beef.  History  The Parthenaise forms a part of the large population ‚Äì sometimes called Poitevine or Vend√©enne ‚Äì of wheaten-coloured cattle which traditionally occupied the western part of France, from the Loire to the Gironde. It is closely related to the Mara√Æchine, the Nantaise and the extinct Marchoise and Berrichonne, all of which belong to the same group. Oxen of this type were used mainly for agricultural draught work in , in the Saintonge, in Touraine and in the Vend√©e. The cattle were sometimes called G√¢tinaises or Boeufs de G√¢tine, so named for the G√¢tine Vend√©enne. At the end of their working lives, these oxen were often sent to the area of Cholet to be fattened for slaughter; these were known as Choletaises. The name of the breed is due to , who in 1860 identified Parthenay, in the d√©partement of Deux-S√®vres, as the principal centre of production. In the second half of the nineteenth century many vineyards were destroyed by phylloxera and uprooted; the land was turned to pasture. A number of dairy co-operatives were formed, and the Parthenaise was used to produce a type of butter marketed as \\"Charente-Poitou\\", which quickly became well-known. By the late nineteenth century there were some 1.1 million head. A herd-book was established in 1893 or 1894. From that time the population began to decline. This was partly because of the mechanisation of agriculture, which reduced the need for draught cattle, and partly because of competition from specialised breeds which began to reach the area from other parts of France: the Maine-Anjou and later the Charolaise for beef, and the Normande and later the Friesian for milk. After the Second World War the Parthenaise was still well represented in the Vend√©e and the G√¢tine, but was under threat, both from the difficulty of finding bulls that met the stringent regulations for registration for artificial insemination, and from reduction of herds by culling to eradicate bovine tuberculosis. By the 1960s it had become clear that the dual-purpose aim for the breed was no longer viable, and in 1971 the decision was taken to select for beef production only. Since that time the population has grown consistently: the number of breeding cows rose from 7 000 in 1990 to 33 000 in 2008. In 2014 the total breed population was reported at 43 187. In 2000 it was decided that the criterion for distinguishing the modern Parthenaise from the more traditional Mara√Æchine ‚Äì which also descends from the old Vend√©enne grouping ‚Äì would be the bulls used for reproduction: offspring of bulls born later than Joli-Coeur (born in 1974) would be considered Parthenaises, while offspring of older bulls, of which stocks of semen were still held, could be considered Mara√Æchines. A genetic study in 2004 found Joli-Coeur and all approved Parthenais bulls born after him to be homozygous for the mh double-muscling gene, while bulls used in Mara√Æchine breeding were heterozygous or homozygous recessive. The Mara√Æchine thus represents a traditional form of the Parthenaise. The breed has been exported to the Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands the United Kingdom and Australia.  Characteristics  The hair colour is golden brown, with lighter eyes, muzzle and legs while the nose, hooves, and tail are black. Horns are lyre-shaped.  Use  After a multi purpose history, they have been selectively bred as a pure beef breed since 1970, with a degree of double muscling, producing good tasting lean meat. Cows have enough milk to rear their calves.

According to Christian Settipani, their father was probably Sigobert the Lame, King of Cologne, rather than Sigebert I of Austrasia, as indicated by Flodoard. Together they founded the Abbey of Saint Pierre de Reims. Beuve was the first abbess. Family Based on an oral tradition recorded by Flodoard, Canon of Reims, three centuries later, Beuve and her brother Balderic were reputed to be children of a king Sigebert, whom Flodoard identified as Sigebert I, king of Austrasia.Flodoard, Historia eccclesi√¶ Remensis, Livre quatri√®me, chapter XXXVIII Many early historians follow Fodoard in this. However, Christian Settipani finds that this contradicts what is known about Sigebert I.Settipani, Christian. \\"L'apport de l'onomastique dans l'√©tude des g√©n√©alogies carolingiennes\\", Onomastique et Parent√© dans l'Occident m√©di√©val, Oxford, Linacre College, Unit for Prosopographical Research, coll. Prosopographica et Genealogica, 2000, 310 p. (), p. 219. Sigebert is known to have had a son, Childebert II, and daughters Ingund (wife of Hermenegild), Clodesinde, betrothed to Authari, king of the Lombards, then to Reccared, king of the Visigoths and probably a daughter married to Duke Chrodoald. Sigebert I may have had other daughters mentioned by his contemporaries, but the case of an unknown son is much less certain. According to the Salic law, on the death of a Frankish king, all his sons would share the kingdom. It is more likely that Beuve and Balderic are the offspring of Sigobert the Lame (d. 507), king of Cologne. They have a niece Doda who succeeds Beuve as abbess of Saint Pierre de Reims, and who later obtains from a prince named Pepin letters of protection for this community. It is clear that this prince can only be Pepin of Landen, mayor of the palace of Austrasia. Apart from Bald√©ric and Beuve, the only other known child of Sigobert is Chlod√©ric, who died in 508, so Doda, if she is the daughter of Chlod√©ric, was born at the latest in 508. P√©pin of Landen became mayor of the palace in 613 at the earliest, giving Doda an age of at least 105 years at the time of signature of the act of protection, although it is not clear that Pepin was already mayor at the time the act was issued. There is no evidence that Doda was Chlod√©ric's daughter. She was likely born of an unnamed daughter of Sigebert, towards the end of his life, around 505-508. Her daughter Doda would then be born between 520 and 550, which gives her a more reasonable age at the time of the act of protection. The date of 545 may be retained for the birth of Doda. This leaves sixteen years to the accession of Sigebert I as king of Austrasia, and the legend affirms that she was promised in marriage to a lord of the court of Sigebert I.\\" Sainte Beuve de Reims\\", Vie des Saints et des Bienheureux selon l'ordre du calendrier, vol. 4 (Avril), Librairie Letouzey et An√©, 1946 Life Beuve seems to have begun her religious life in the monastery for women established at Reims by Clotilde and Saint Remigius. As it was outside the city walls, her brother Balderic built a house within the walls to provide greater protection for the nuns. He then went on to found the Abbey of Montfaucon. Although Beuve wished to remain a simple nun, she was named abbess of the monastery Saint-Pierre. She established the Rule of St. Benedict in the abbey, and humbly practiced many fasts, prayers and vigils. Her brother Abbot Balderic visited regularly sharing advice and encouragement.Schulenburg, Jane Tibbetts. Forgetful of Their Sex: Female Sanctity and Society, Ca. 500‚Äì1100, University of Chicago Press, 1998, , p. 284 On one such occasion Balderic became ill and died during a visit to Saint Pierre. Initially buried in the abbey, his remains were moved to Montfaucon. Beuve undertook the education of her niece Doda and welcomed her when she took the veil to escape a forced marriage. Upon Beuve's death, Doda succeeded her aunt as abbess. They are also said to be related to King Dagobert, presumably Dagobert I of Austrasia. Saint Beuve was the first abbess of Saint-Pierre-les- Dames in Reims. In 639, her brother Balderic established the convent for her. She was succeeded as abbess by her niece Doda (or Dode). Her feast day is April 24.

He painted in the Outsider Art tradition coined by the British art critic Roger Cardinal in 1974, first studied by the German psychiatrist and art historian Hans Prinzhorn in the 1920s, and popularized as Art Brut by the French abstract artist Jean Dubuffet in the 1950s. Tirilly's oeuvre stands among the strongest contemporary examples of Art Brut in Europe. His deft technique and unusual sense of vision and purpose, however, stand in sharp contrast to the commonly prescribed features of Art Brut, notably autodidacticism and dissociativism. As such, Tirilly is also a proponent of Marginal or Singular Art (in French, L'art singulier), an art current that eschews many of the habitual artistic qualifiers be they subject, style, method, or purpose. His work is included in the Neuve Invention section of the important Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Early life  A self-taught artist, Tirilly began painting in 1986 at age 40. Prior to his genesis of the late 1980s, he lived a largely piecemeal life. He trained as a navy mechanic, enlisted in the Marine Nationale, and travelled the globe for a number of years aboard the Foch aircraft carrier. He then resettled in France, working odd jobs in Brittany while cultivating the elaborate visions of quotidian life in coastal Finist√®re that had always consumed him and would later constitute his central subject. During a childhood marked by the absence of television, Tirilly's exposure to the absurd and unusual emerged ironically out of his provincial milieu: travelling circuses, drunken bouts between village mendicants, delinquent apple thieves, village idiots, and the host of passers-by and external influences that coloured Breton village life through the second half of the twentieth century.  Work  Codex CCCLXIX, acrylic on paper, 1999 Codex DLXXXIX, acrylic on paper, 2001 While it is difficult to ascribe influences to Tirilly's work, references to formative elements can be found. The macabre and lugubrious tone of his paintings is in part attributed to the artist's esteem for the work of fifteenth century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. Tirilly's litany of contorted and tormented characters also calls to mind the late works of Francisco Goya, the figural works of Francis Bacon, the portraits of Lucian Freud, and the oneiric netherworlds of Odilon Redon, all the while maintaining characteristic differences between the influence and the influenced. His palette and swatch-like application of colour seem strongly influenced by the Pont-Aven School artists, notably French compatriots Paul Gauguin, Paul S√©rusier, and √âmile Bernard, and the Art Brut tradition out of which he painted had as much to do with Jean Dubuffet as with general countercultural trends in post-World War II French art. Ultimately however, Tirilly's work defies direct influence. The derivatives are so tangential, the oeuvre of such extreme individuality that most attempts at having the paintings accord with formally accepted critical notions and forebear influences are easily quashed. Tirilly's paintings are largely autobiographical, each image capturing childhood memories, family relatives, personal hardships, or transient pleasures. Despite the apparent anguish in his work, humanizing elements such as family, friendship, and nostalgia temper bleakness with hope, suffering with redemption. Self-portraits are common but typically framed within the context of memory or dream. Tirilly's paintings are meticulously catalogued via a system modelled on the Aztec and Maya codices; a codex number is assigned to each completed work and subsequent paintings follow in numerical succession. He favoured board and paper over canvas and acrylic paints over oils claiming the media were better suited to his work. Tirilly's body of work is unique among the output of autodidact artists working consciously within the rough-hewn parameters of Outsider Art. While the label is no doubt limiting, the artist's atypical ability to combine the fantastic with the banal, personal distortion with autobiography, and joy with torment is a strong example of the tripartite tension between academism, realism, and neophytism central to the traditions of Na√Øve, Raw, and Outsider art. Jean Tirilly died in 2009 leaving behind one of the finest, most idiosyncratic bodies of work in French outsider art history.

He was born in Hamelin in the Electorate of Hanover and died in Schloss Buchwald in Prussian Silesia.  Life  Monument to Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden on Market square, Chorz√≥w. Reden came from the noble family of Reden, in which mining was a long-standing interest. He was the nephew of the Hanoverian Berghauptmann Claus Friedrich von Reden, as well as of Friedrich Anton von Heynitz, a reformer of Prussian mining and metallurgy. One of his cousins was the leading American mountain man Friedrich Otto Burchard von Reden. In 1768 Reden began an apprenticeship at various mines of the Oberharz. Between 1770 and 1773 he was a student at G√∂ttingen and at Halle. After passing the civil service examination to become an administrative officer, he travelled through Holland, England, and France, visiting mines and metallurgical plants. At the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, he took a degree in mineralogy and geology under the supervision of Abraham Gottlob Werner. In 1777, he entered the Hanoverian civil service, and was soon appointed by Friedrich Anton von Heynitz to Berlin, in the Department of Mines. In the late 18th century, Reden played an important role in the development of industry in Silesia. For example, on Reden's initiative, in 1787 one of the first steam-powered pumps in continental Europe was installed in an ore mine at Tarnowitz. Together with John Baildon, Reden was responsible for the introduction of coke into modern steelmaking process in Europe (in Gleiwitz (Gliwice), 1796, and, on a large scale, in K√∂nigsh√ºtte (Chorz√≥w), 1802). Reden was knighted by Friedrich Wilhelm II. Following the Napoleonic occupation of Prussia, he remained in office as the Minister of Mines to prevent the plundering of the mines by the French. Because of speeches on 9 November 1806, on the French occupying power, he was sacked from his ministry by Frederick William III, on 9 July 1807. In the evening of his life, Reden retired to the Hirschberger Tal (Kotlina Jeleniog√≥rska), at the well situated Buchwald (Bukowiec), which he had acquired in 1785. In 1802, he married Friederike Riedesel, Freiin zu Eisenbach, (:de:Friederike von Reden) daughter of Friedrich Adolf Riedesel and Frederika Charlotte Riedesel, but the marriage remained childless. There is a recently (2002 by Augustyn Dyrda) rebuilt monument to Reden in Chorz√≥w (). The original statue, a bronce cast made by the german sculptor Theodor Kalide, was erected in 1853 on mining ground. This monument has a turbulent history having been demolished and restored several times with the changing political winds in Silesia (1945 definitely pulled down). On 4 June 1935, the Society of German metalworks and miners donated the Reden medal, on the 25th Anniversary of the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, as an award for excellent dissertations from mining and metallurgical engineers. This award is given since 1948, by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, Raw Material and Environmental Technology.

Biography  Maella was born in Valencia. His artistic education began with his father, who was also a painter. In 1752, at the age of eleven, he moved to Madrid and received lessons from Felipe de Castro, a sculptor who helped introduce the Neoclassical style to Spain.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. This was followed by enrollment at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he attracted the attention of Antonio Gonz√°lez Vel√°zquez (whose daughter he would later marry). In 1757, with the money from three prizes awarded by the Academia and the support of his family, he was able to study in Rome. He returned to Spain in 1765 and participated in the remodeling of the Palacio Real de Madrid under the direction of Anton Raphael Mengs, who had a significant influence on his style. In 1772, he created illustrations for a new edition of works by Francisco de Quevedo. His career in Madrid began in earnest when he was appointed a court painter in 1774 and became well known for his portraits.Brief biography @ MCN Biograf√≠as. He not only worked at the Palacio Real, but at La Granja de San Ildefonso, the Palacio de El Pardo and the Palacio de El Escorial as well. In addition, he restored works by Juan de Borgo√±a at the Cathedral of Toledo, painted frescoes at Burgo de Osma Cathedral and created designs for the Royal Tapestry Factory; where he also served as a supervisor for the new artists. From 1795 to 1798, following the death of Francisco Bayeu, he served as Director General of the Academia. In 1799, he and Francisco Goya were named as primary court painters and he began to work on the restoration of several Royal sites. After the fall of King Carlos IV in 1808, he did not hesitate to switch his allegiance to the new French government of King Jos√© I and received the King's hospitality in return. This eventually led to the end of his career. When King Fernando VII took the throne, Maella was accused of being afrancesado, dismissed from the court, and retired with only a fifth of his salary, to be replaced by Vicente L√≥pez Porta√±a, one of his students. He died, aged 79, in Madrid.

It has a population of about 2,128. It consists of two villages: Ochaby Wielkie and Ochaby Ma≈Çe. It is known from a large horse stud farm, one of the largest in Silesia.  Etymology  The name of the villages are of topographic origin, a plural form of the Slavic-rooted word ochab, denoting swamp, quagmire or bog. The supplementary adjectives Wielkie and Ma≈Çe mean Great(er)/Large and Lesser/Small respectively.  History  The settlement lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Ochabe. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precise). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what would later be known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Ochabn. After 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings) in the region by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 15 April 1654. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumie≈Ñ. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1070 in 1880 to 1101 in 1910 with a dwindling majority being native Polish-speakers (99.9% in 1880 to 93.3% in 1910) accompanied by a growing German-speaking minority (1 person in 1880 to 72 or 6.7% in 1910), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (64.8%), followed by Protestants (34.6%) and Jews (7 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War (the Battle of Skocz√≥w took place nearby) and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.  Geography  Ochaby lies in the southern part of Poland, approximately north of the nearest town, Skocz√≥w, north-east of the county seat, Cieszyn, north-west of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, south-west of the regional capital Katowice, and east of the border with the Czech Republic. The settlement is situated on both banks of the Vistula, in O≈õwiƒôcim Basin, between roughly above sea level, north-west of the Silesian Beskids. The so≈Çectwo is further subdivided into Ochaby Wielkie (the northern part) and Ochaby Ma≈Çe (the southern part). There are numerous fish ponds in Ochaby.

Although serious articles occasionally appeared within, Bomb Rack's tone was often light-hearted and humorous with numerous photos and pin-ups, as well as a full page of locally drawn cartoons. Sports were covered extensively, as were topics important to airmen at the time such as education and returning to the United States as quickly as possible. The exact number of issues published is unknown, but copies were distributed at least between October 7, 1945, and January 21, 1946, and ran through number 16. Bomb Rack's length was eight pages, but sometimes also included a one-page bulletin containing official information. Unlike the Air Force's official histories from the time that focused on operations, manpower, and so forth, periodicals such as Bomb Rack provide a glimpse of everyday life in the Air Force. History Bomb Rack was established on Guam by Joe Whitley, who joined the Air Force at Randolph Field in 1943 and worked in public relations there until he was assigned to the 7th AAF at Hickam Field, Hawaii as correspondent for the 7th. It was a weekly magazine for the B-29 crews and ground forces. Whitley was a correspondent and covered raids from Guam, Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima.Foreign Service Vol. 33-34 page 7 1945 Whitley later wrote the book Pacific Paradise with Clive Howard. Volume one number one was October 7, 1945. During World War II, AAF organizations and units often had their own newsletters, so it is possible that the 20th Air Force also had a newsletter that preceded Bomb Rack. That, however, is speculation, and precisely when the magazine ceased production is also unknown. From 1945 to 1949, the 20th Air Force's headquarters was located at Harmon Field near the cliffs above Guam's famous resort beach on Tumon Bay, and a newsletter entitled Harmon Rocket was published at Harmon Field at least in 1945, though almost nothing is known of that publication. By 1949 Andersen Air Force Base, Guam's only remaining Air Force base, was publishing its own weekly paper called Tropic Topics. Format What makes Bomb Rack more of a \\"magazine\\" than a newspaper or newsletter is its size, the quality of its paper, and most significantly, its format. Each issue's cover is a single photograph (except for October 7, 1945, which is a sketch of then Lieutenant General Nathan Farragut Twining) with a brief mention of the content. Issues normally included a letters page, a political cartoon (sometimes military related), numerous feature stories, a sports section, and a cartoon page. Extant editions Bomb Rack was published for at least four months, but out of the sixteen printed only the following eleven editions are known to have survived: *October 7, 1945 / Vol 1 No 1 *October 14, 1945 / Vol 1 No 2 *October 21, 1945 / Vol 1 No 3 *December 3, 1945 / Vol 1 No 9 *December 10, 1945 / Vol 1 No 10 *December 17, 1945 / Vol 1 No 11 *December 24, 1945 / Vol 1 No 12 *December 31, 1945 / Vol 1 No 13 *January 7, 1946 / Vol 1 No 14 *January 14, 1946 / Vol 1 No 15 *January 21, 1946 / Vol 1 No 16 Cartoon page On the last page of most issues was an entire page of four to six one-panel comics of surprisingly high quality in terms of art and humor. Jokes usually dealt with life in the military, but also included sly commentaries on post-war civilian life, relations with women, and native islanders. Among the cartoonists was at least one who achieved considerable fame working for Mad Magazine in the postwar period: Dave Berg (cartoonist).

A saxophone quartet is a musical ensemble composed of four saxophones, typically soprano, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones. Different saxophone family members are employed to provide a larger range and a variety of tone colours. Other arrangements of instruments also exist, but are rarer. A piece of music composed for such an ensemble can also itself be referred to as a saxophone quartet. History The saxophone was developed in 1840 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, flautist, and clarinetist based in Brussels. Sax went to considerable effort to popularize the instrument but faced opposition in his efforts from his fellow instrument makers at the time. Despite being initially conceived of as an orchestral instrument, it was through the avenue of military music that the instrument first gained significant momentum. Composer Jean-Baptiste Singelee had written works for four saxophones in the 19th century. These included Allegro de concert (AATB), Quatuor en 4 Parties (SATB), and Grand Quatuor Concertant en 3 Parties (SATB). In 1878, the Gilmour Band featured a quartet of saxophones which included Edouard Lef√®bre, a soloist in the band. Lef√®bre went on to form his own saxophone quartet in 1905 with a repertoire of transcriptions. The main impetus for the recognition of this ensemble was by Marcel Mule, who was the second Professor of saxophone at the Paris Conservatoire after Adolphe Sax himself. In 1928, he founded Le Quatuor de la Musique de la Garde R√©publicaine, later known as Le Quatuor de saxophones de Paris, and then the Marcel Mule Quartet. The founding members were: *Marcel Mule on soprano *Ren√© Chalign√© on alto *Hippolyte Poimboeuf on tenor *Georges Chauvet on baritone Subsequent members included: *Paul Romby *Fernande L‚Äôhomme *Georges Charron *Marcel Josse *Andr√© Bauchy *Georges Gourdet *Guy Lacour Many works for saxophone quartet that are now considered part of the standard repertoire were written for this ensemble. Mule himself also arranged works for this group. Daniel Deffayet was a student of Marcel Mule, and later professor of saxophone at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1953 he founded the ‚Äò‚ÄôQuatuor de Saxophones Daniel Deffayet‚Äô‚Äô with other members Jacques Maffei, Jacques Terry and Jean Ledieu. Sigurd Rascher, his daughter Carina Rascher, Bruce Weinberger and Linda Bangs formed the Rascher Saxophone Quartet in 1969 which continues to this day. Jean-Yves Fourmeau formed his own quartet in 1979. These ensembles contributed significantly to expanding the repertoire through their work with composers. Notable composers who have written quartets include Phil Woods, Alexander Glazunov, Eugene Bozza, Philip Glass, and others. Since the 1970s jazz quartets have started to emerge as well, broadening the scope of the ensemble and the idiom of the repertoire. Current Forms The Deep Schrott bass-saxophone quartet Saxophone quartets abound as amateur and professional ensembles as well as university-affiliated groups.https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/bender_rhett_l_200012_dma.pdf (page 2) The most recent World Saxophone Congress, in 2015, hosted a competition specifically for saxophone quartets with a first prize of 4000 euros and a recital,http://www.saxopen.com/en/saxophone-quartet-competition won by Keuris Saxophone Quartet.http://www.keurisquartet.com/ Saxophone quartets also compete in, and have won, the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, which is the world's largest classical chamber music competition. While SATB remains the most common classical configuration, occasionally the soprano is replaced by another alto leading to an AATB configuration particularly in jazz and contemporary ensembles.

It has a population of 2,442 (2008).  Etymology  Originally the name of the village was Prochna or Prochno. The name of the village is of topographic origin and is derived from the rotten trees (pr√≥chno in Polish denotes dry rot). It was sometimes Germanised as Pruchnau.  History  The village lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Prochna. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precise). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what would later be known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Prochna. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 15 April 1654. In 1844-1863 a train station has been constructed in Pruchna on the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Schwarzwasser. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 1525 in 1880 to 1467 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (95.6%-96.4%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 59 or 4.1% in 1890) and Czech-speaking (at most 20 or 1.4% in 1900), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (64.1%), followed by Protestants (35%) and Jews (13 or 0.9%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria- Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. In 1945 a Catholic Saint Anne church was almost completely destroyed, and it had to be rebuilt. There is also a Lutheran Resurrection of the Lord Church, and a memorial to soldiers of the Red Army fallen in Pruchna in the last months of World War II.  Geography  Pruchna lies in the southern part of Poland, approximately south-west of the nearest town, Strumie≈Ñ, north of the county seat, Cieszyn, west of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, south-west of the regional capital Katowice, and east of the border with the Czech Republic. The village is situated near the geographical border between Ostrava Basin in the west and O≈õwiƒôcim Basin in the east, between roughly above sea level, north-west of the Silesian Beskids. It also straddles over the border between watersheds of Odra (through Olza to the west) and Vistula (through Knajka to the east); The largest stretch of forest, called Badula, is located in the south-east part of the village.

Geography  The community‚Äôs elevation ranges from 310 to 340 m above sea level.  Location  Oberelbert lies roughly 5 km south of Montabaur in the Nassau Nature Park on the Stelzenbach. The community belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Montabaur, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town.  History  Sometime before 1200, in the municipal area (Bann) of the village of Humbach (Montabaur), the Archbishop of Trier owned, among other things, a Wildhube (a fief that required the holder to protect Imperial hunting rights) at Elewartin. In the time between 1212 and 1214 there was in the extensive woodlands around Humbach ‚Äì the Spurginberch Forest ‚Äì two F√∂rsterhuben at Elwartin. These were foresters‚Äô farmsteads with fields in the forest. In 1233 there was a dispute between members of the St. Florin Monastery at Koblenz involving the use of the Pfaffenholz Forest near Elewarthe. In 1362 came a documentary mention of Niederelbert (inferiori Elewarten), which suggests that there must have been an Oberelbert by this time, too (Nieder‚Äì is German for ‚Äúnether‚Äù or ‚Äúlower‚Äù, while Ober‚Äì means ‚Äúupper‚Äù). It was not until 1436, however, that Oberelbert was explicitly named (Obern and Nyddern Elwart). In a treaty, the Lords of Helfenstein, as holders of the Elbert landlordship, and the villages of Nieder Elbartt and Obern Elbartt reached a compromise thanks to concessions from the farmers and a meal from the landlords. In 1476, or by 1584 at the latest, Oberelbert had a chapel. The Oberelbert coalmine was part of the Amt and Bann of Montabaur before 1500, but after the Bann of Montabaur was partitioned about 1550 or 1560, the community passed to the Bann of Holler. In 1508, the representatives from Oberelbert and Niederelbert acknowledged by old usage in a Weisentum the Archbishop of Trier as their overlord and the Lords of Helfenstein as Lords of the Court. In 1519, the Archbishop of Trier transferred half the Elbert landlordship to the Lords of Nassau (at the Sporkenburg, which was a castle) as a fief. In 1602, three fourths of the landlordship was held by the Lords of Metternich. The other fourth was a cameralistic possession in the Electorate of Trier. Between 1630 and 1636, during the Thirty Years' War, Oberelbert was utterly destroyed and became uninhabitable. Beginning about 1642, building work to restore the community and settle it once again was undertaken. In 1711, a new chapel was built. In 1770, a parish was established with Welschneudorf as a branch. In 1795, the villagers brought their livestock to the Metternicher Heck (paddock) before the plundering French Revolutionary Army could steal the animals. In 1802, Oberelbert‚Äôs hitherto Trier subjects became subjects of the Duchy of Nassau. On 12 September 1811, the village burnt down, leaving only six small houses standing. Many important buildings had to be restored. In 1812, the community bakery was built once again, followed by the parish house in 1815 and 1816, the school in 1823 and 1824 and the church between 1830 and 1832. Between 1813 and 1815, scattered French soldiers on their way back home from Russia brought typhus to the village. Many died as a result of this illness. In 1820, the graveyard was moved from the church to its current location. In 1866, the Duchy was annexed by Prussia. In 1913, at the Bu√ükreuz, an aerodrome was established. In mid-August, two planes were in an accident during approach. In 1916, during the First World War, petroleum shortages led to a quickening of the electrical supply. On 3 March, electric streetlights shone for the first time. In 1923, the houses were connected to the new central waterworks. Postal bus service between Montabaur and Welschneudorf by way of Oberelbert was begun on 11 November 1926. Between 1926 and 1931, there was considerable building work in the community. In the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), 38 Oberelberters lost their lives as a result of acts of war. After the war, the community was expanded beginning in 1953. A new school was built in 1962 and dedicated in 1964. Rubbish collection began in 1966. In 1972, the community joined the Verbandsgemeinde of Montabaur. In 1982, schooling in the community ended. The Stelzenbachhalle (community hall) was built in 1993 and 1994, and dedicated on 25 November 1994. In 1997, Oberelbert was expecting its one thousandth inhabitant.

From 1030, the Knights of Molsberg had their seat here on the north slope of the Eichberg (405 m) at their castle. The model of the castle may still be seen today at Schlo√ü Molsberg (residential castle). In 1458, Count Philipp the Elder of Katzenelnbogen released for the 12,000 gulden by which he had raised his daughter Anna's dowry, a parcel of land to Limburg, Molsberg and Brechen from Count Reinhard of Solms and Frank of Kronberg to whom Landgrave Ludwig of Hesse had pledged it.http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/ Molsberg, die Geschichte der Grafschaft Katzenelnbogen und der erste Riesling der Welt The von Walderdorff noble family had its seat in Molsberg as of 1657.  Politics   Community council  The council is made up of 8 council members who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 13 June 2004.  Coat of arms  The community's arms might heraldically be described thus: Gules a lion rampant argent armed and langued Or. These arms are demonstrably akin to the 1662 court seal. The noble lords of Molsberg had a coat of arms that was first mentioned in 1347 and showed a silver lion on a red field with a golden tongue, accompanied by a blue triple-etched gorget.  Culture and sightseeing In the middle of the village stands the renovated former village school from 1830, which today serves as the mayor's office. Opposite stands the former seat of the Schulthei√ü (roughly, ‚Äúsheriff‚Äù) in a more than 300-year-old timber-frame house. Schloss Molsberg was built in 1760 on the former castle's site and has at its disposal a park with trees that are under monumental protection.  Regular events  At Whitsun the traditional Pfingstkirmes (Whitsun kermis) is held. On Whit Monday, an open-air church service is held if the weather is fair, and this is followed by a Corpus Christi procession, in turn followed by a Fr√ºhschoppen (a morning drink or brunch) with a concert in the square in the castle laneway under the old lindens of the Counts of Walderdorff. After prayers in the castle chapel, the kermis youth's parade begins. First at the Count's, then at the mayor's and finally in the lower village, the kermis youth dance. Here all kinds of funny anecdotes from the past year are told. The kermis festivities then move farther on to the school field. In the summer in the Counts‚Äô castle laneway, the Kaffeehausnachmittag (‚ÄúCoffeehouse Afternoon‚Äù) is held by the Wallmerod collective municipality's cultural promotion club. To the sound of waltzes, coffee and cake are served in the shade afforded by the lindens. As a general rule, the tradition-rich Molsberger Markt (market) is held on the second Saturday in October. In 2007, however, on organizational grounds, it was moved up to 29 September.

Geography Location The recognized tourist community of Nordhofen lies on the abandoned stretch of the Westerwaldbahn (railway) between Siershahn and Altenkirchen in the heart of a mountainous landscape wooded with beeches and spruces. The community belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Selters, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. History In 1259, Nordhofen had its first documentary mention. In 1357, Emperor Karl IV granted Count Wilhelm of Wied the right to expand Nordhofen into a town. He received the right ‚Äúto be allowed to build with stones, put together, lay out and make into a walled town the village and its layout with moats, walls, towers, oriels, gates, and other things as he can and likes to do, without anyone‚Äôs hindering or speaking against it‚Äù. Owing to the absence of the natural conditions for a town location, the town of Nordhofen could not be properly developed. Hence, in 1653, Emperor Ferdinand III transferred the town rights from Nordhofen to the more favourable location of the new settlement of Neuwied at the request of the then Count Friedrich of Wied. In 1972, in the course of municipal restructuring, the Verbandsgemeinde of Selters was founded, to which Nordhofen belongs. Religion To the Evangelical parish belong the communities of Nordhofen, Mogendorf, Vielbach and Quirnbach. Until 1851, Selters and the surrounding villages also belonged to the parish.

Its seat is in the like-named town. Constituent communities Nistertal's Ortsteile are B√ºdingen and Erbach. History In 1274, B√ºdingen had its first documentary mention. Erbach's first documentary mention followed in 1353. Amalgamations The community of Nistertal came into being in 1969 in the course of administrative reform through the merger of the communities of B√ºdingen and Erbach. For centuries before this, the Gro√üe Nister, flowing between the two places, marked not only a political boundary, but a dialectal and religious one, too. Politics Community council The council is made up of 16 council members drawn from two voting communities (W√§hlergemeinschaften) who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 13 June 2004. Coat of arms The two uppermost charges in the community's arms stand for the two constituent communities of B√ºdingen and Erbach. The hexagon and the miner's hammers symbolize the rich basalt deposits and their exploitation as the community's characteristic industry and livelihood. The alder twig refers to the Ortsteil name Erbach (from Erlenbach ‚Äì Erle being German for ‚Äúalder‚Äù). The wavy parting per pale represents the community's location on the Nister, with B√ºdingen on the left and Erbach on the right. The bridge that fills out the shield's lower portion is a symbol of the Erbach Bridge as well as the roadbridge between the two constituent communities. The tinctures gold and blue were those borne by the Duchy of Nassau. They refer to the community's centuries-long territorial allegiance to that state. Culture and sightseeing Buildings The railway bridge near Erbach across the river Nister was at the time of its completion in 1911 Germany's biggest concrete bridge. With a length of some 300 m and a height of almost 40 m, at the time still without steel armouring, it was held to be a technological wonder. After the Erbach-Bad Marienberg (Westerwald)-Fehl-Ritzhausen railway line was shut down in 1971, the bridge was preserved as a technological building monument. Also worthy of mention is the Wasserbr√ºcke (‚ÄúWaterbridge‚Äù). At this bridge, water is borne across the tracks of the Nistertal-Bad Marienberg railway line.

For the last two decades of her career, she was the Barton L. Weller Professor of Political Economy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Amsden was known best for her work on the developmental state, which argued that state-led industrialization was a viable alternative to the market-oriented industrialization of North America and Europe. Her scholarship focused on the catch-up of late-industrializing economies, particularly the \\"Asian Tigers.\\" Amsden found their growth was accomplished through government intervention that established price control and import substitution policies, promoted organizational learning, and arranged \\"reciprocal control mechanisms\\" between states and private firms. Her work is viewed as a rebuttal of the Washington Consensus and neoclassical economic theories that sought to restrain state intervention in the developmental process. Life and career Born in New York City, Amsden received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University and her PhD from the London School of Economics. Amsden began her career as an economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and taught at University of California, Los Angeles, Barnard College at Columbia University, Harvard Business School and The New School before being appointed professor at MIT in 1994. She remained in MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning until her death in 2012. In addition to teaching and writing, she was a consultant to the World Bank, OECD and various organizations within the United Nations. In 2002, she was awarded the Leontief Prize by the Global Development and Environment Institute and was named one of the top 50 visionaries by Scientific American for her premise that one-size- fits-all economic policies are ill-suited for poor countries looking to become industrialized. In 2009, she was appointed by the United Nations secretary- general to a 3-year seat on the U.N. Committee on Development Policy, a subsidiary of the U.N. Economic and Social Council. The 24-member committee provides inputs and independent advice to the council on emerging cross- sectoral development issues and on international cooperation for development. Amsden wrote several books about the industrialization of developing countries. Her work emphasized the importance of the state as a facilitator and guide of economic development. She also saw knowledge as a crucial determinant of economic growth. Her books include Asia's Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialisation and The Rise of the Rest. In the former she concentrated on the development of South Korea and in the latter she compared the experiences of several developing countries‚Äîmostly East Asian and Latin American countries. In 2012, Amsden died suddenly at her home in Cambridge at the age of 68. Books In addition to numerous journal articles, Amsden published: * The Role of Elites in Economic Development, Oxford University Press, 2012, (with Alisa Di Caprio and James A. Robinson). * Escape from Empire: The Developing World's Journey through Heaven and Hell, MIT Press, 2007. * Beyond Late Development: Taiwan's Upgrading Policies, MIT Press, 2003, (with Wan Wen Chu). * The Rise of \\"The Rest\\": Challenges to the West From Late-Industrializing Economies, Oxford University Press, 2001. * The Market Meets Its Match: Restructuring the Economies of Eastern Europe, Harvard University Press, 1994 (with Jacek Kochanowicz and Lance Taylor). * Asia's Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization, Oxford University Press, 1989.

The name lives on in America, it became Ermentraudt then Armentrout. -Daryl Armentrout\\" The best source on this topic is the Armentrout Family History, 1739-1978 compiled by Russell S. Armentrout and published in 1980 by the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, U.S.A.. According to ship's records, 340 passengers sailed on the Samuel, under Captain Hugh Percy. They sailed from Rotterdam, stopping at the English port of Deal for supplies, en route to arrival in the port of Philadelphia and William Penn's colony of Pennsylvania. Anna Elizabeth Ermentraudt was about forty and traveling with seven children and her younger brother, Peter Hain. The fate of her husband is unknown. Her elder brother, George Hain, was already established on farmland near Lancaster, Pennsylvania and the family first established itself in what is now known as \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\" country (a corruption of the German \\"Deutsch\\"). She lived in that area from 1739 until 1752, when she accompanied her sons to Virginia and settled in the home of her second son, Johan Phillip, where she died in 1775. It is likely she is buried in Peaked Mountain Church (a.k.a. Pinquit Moundyn) cemetery, in McGaheysville, VA. But there is no grave marker to verify this and the church has been torn down, leaving only a marker at the old cemetery to commemorate its site on US Route 33. Virginia descendants still live on the western side of Massanutten Mtn., referred to as the Peaked Mountain by Shenandoah Valley Germans, from north of Keezletown to the town of McGaheysville. The Armentrouts were farmers who followed the American frontier and American Indian treaty lines across the entire country. Amongst their many identities, they have included a US Navy admiral in California, the head of the Audubon Society in Texas, a well-known radio newscaster in Chicago, the wife of an Indian Agent in Oklahoma, and farmers everywhere among the many branches of this old and deeply rooted German- American family tree. Today, the descendants of the seven children: Johannes, daughter Anna Elizabeth (who married her first cousin, Johan Frederick Hain), Johan Phillip, Johan Friedrich, Christopher, Johan Heinrich and Johan Georg constitute a single family tree. Russell Armentrout's genealogy was compiled based upon written records (births, deaths, deeds, ship records, etc.) and upon extended-family informants. The result of extensive use of oral records is that, wherever a lack of written records exists, there is the likelihood of many errors, small and large, in the seven individual siblings' genealogies provided by distant relatives over many years' correspondence with Russell Armentrout, who lived in Michigan. \\"This book ain't no good. Your Uncle Gail never owned no gas station,\\" said my Aunt Sis, who introduced me to the book at her home in Lake Charles, LA some years ago. Her censure illustrates the dangers of such a compilation. Her youngest brother, my Uncle Gail, was a West Mansfield farmer who also managed a \\"Victory\\" gas station in Mt. Victory, Ohio, but never owned it. And several family names were misspelled, including my Italian immigrant mother's maiden name. Russell Armentrout's source was a first-cousin in Kentucky. Multiply my family entry by several hundred and you begin to see how fragile is this work as history. It must be read with care and cross-checking. But where Aunt Sis found frustration, I found a treasure trove of extended identity that allows my children to track backwards through eight generations that preceded them to the \\"New World\\", and beyond that to the family's Protestant origins in the German Rhineland and the historical events, like the Thirty Years' War and religious persecution they fled. For that, every Armentrout in America owes Russell S. Armentrout a debt of gratitude. (This section added by Fred Armentrout of the Johannes Ermentraudt branch, which eventually moved from Virginia to the Ohio Territory in an area taken over by farmers after the military defeat of the Shawnee Nation). On August 27, 1739, Anne Elizabeth Hain Ermentraudt and her sons arrived in America aboard the ship Samuel in Philadelphia. They quickly made their way to Wernersville PA, then after some years moved to The Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Today, many Armentrouts live near Harrisonburg, owning great stretches of farmland. A road called Armentrout Path stretches about 5 miles and is home to Armentrout Farms, run by Kevin Mark \\"Babe\\" Armentrout. On this road a cemetery can be found which holds the graves of early American Armentrouts, and nearby are two other churches, one of which is home to the grave of Anne Elizabeth, though it sits in ruins next to, and under, Brown Memorial Church. Trinity Church sits next to a graveyard with many Armentrouts buried within, and is well taken care of. The Armentrout name has various spellings: \\"Armentrout\\", \\"Armentraut\\", \\"Irmentraut\\", \\"Irmentraudt\\", \\"Irmtraudt\\" Armontrout\\", \\"Armintrout\\", \\"Ermentrout\\".

History Count Gebhard of the Niederlahngau (832‚Äì879) was the first known lord of that holding around Seck in the Middle Westerwald, from which he split the western part to endow his monastery at Gem√ºnden. Count Gebhard's grandson, Rudolf I, Bishop of W√ºrzburg (892‚Äì908) consecrated a church at Seck to Saint Kilian. Seck had its first documentary mention on 27 May 1059 by King Heinrich IV. In the time that followed, Seck acquired a court. Its great parish reached through Rennerod and Lasterbach all the way to Oberrod. Arnold I of Vaucourt, Archbishop of Trier documented in 1181 that the Seligenstatt Monastery in Seck had been donated to the Archmonastery of Trier (Erzstift Trier). In 1215 it was the Maria Laach Abbey's daughter monastery. In the mid 15th century, an end was put to monastery life. In 1468, excise from the Seck yearly market was raised. The Lords of Westerburg and Runkel held sway over the parish of Seck. Often, it was the object of disputes between these two houses and their sidelines. Prince Moritz Heinrich of Nassau-Hadamar had the Secker Weiher (pond) built in 1672, and shortly thereafter also the Schl√∂sschen (little residential castle) at Seck, still known locally as the Alte Burg (‚ÄúOld Castle‚Äù). Along with the Principality of Nassau-Hadamar, Seck passed to the Grand Duchy of Berg in 1806 and later to the Duchy of Nassau. Administratively, Seck went to the Amt of Rennerod. In 1866, Duke Adolf of Nassau lost his land to Prussia. The administrative offices were dissolved, ‚ÄúStein‚Äù self-administration introduced, and Landkreise (rural districts) formed. Seck ended up in the Oberwesterwaldkreis, whose seat was in Marienberg, and then in 1855 in the newly formed Kreis Westerburg, which itself was merged in 1932 into a new Oberwesterwaldkreis with its seat in Westerburg. In 1974, Seck became part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Rennerod, but as an autonomous Ortsgemeinde. The two Westerwald districts (Oberwesterwaldkreis and Unterwesterwaldkreis) were dissolved and merged into the Westerwaldkreis with its seat in Montabaur.

Geography   Location  The community lies midway between the cities of Cologne and Frankfurt am Main in the southwest of the Verbandsgemeinde of Westerburg ‚Äì a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì at an elevation of roughly 370 m above sea level. Neighbouring communities are H√§rtlingen, K√∂lbingen and Brandscheid.  History  Originally, Kaden consisted of several places and lay under the rule of the House of Nassau-Diez in the old Niederlahngau. Among the community's constituent centres was Meiningen, already known to history through a documentary mention in 1295, from whose name came the field names Unter Meiningen and Meininger Grub, still used today. Meiningen lay on the spot of today's constituent community of Grube Anna. The name ‚ÄúElben‚Äù or ‚Äúuff der Elben‚Äù, today the Kaden Ortsteil lying on the Elbbach, was first mentioned in 1417. Kaden, first mentioned in 1559 as zur Keuthen, grew together from several farms. Field names are now all that remains of the former centres of Beilstein and Beuningen Kaden belonged from 1564 to 1802 to the Electorate of Trier. In local speech even today, Kaden is described as being in the Trierschland. In 1802, Caden, as it was then spelt, passed to the Duchy of Nassau. When this was dissolved in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War, the Westerwald became part of Prussia. By community council's decision on 19 May 1936, the placename spelling Caden was changed to Kaden. The change went into force on 1 February 1937. In 1972 came the amalgamation of Kaden into the Verbandsgemeinde of Westerburg in the Westerwaldkreis. Like all other Westerwald villages, Kaden has undergone a shift over the last 50 years from a farming village to an almost purely residential community.  Religion  Historically, the majority of the roughly 630 inhabitants have professed the Catholic faith.  Public institutions   Education  Kaden is home to a two-stream elementary school with about 200 pupils. The school has a gymnasium with integrated village community house, both used by both pupils and clubs for sporting and cultural events. Abutting the schoolground is a sporting ground with a running track used by both the pupils and the village children. The kindergarten is found right nearby. The Hauptschule, the Realschule, the Gymnasium (school), the vocational school and the professional school are in the neighbouring town of Westerburg, roughly 5 km away.  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  Through the buslines of the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund, the Westerburg-Limburg-Frankfurt and Westerburg-Altenkirchen- Cologne railway lines and the InterCityExpress stop in Montabaur, Kaden is linked to the long-distance transport network.  Coat of arms  Coat of arms With the certificate issued on 13 October 1992, the community of Kaden is now entitled to bear its own arms. The coat of arms was created from heraldist Manfred Limbach's design and is based in history. The community consisted of several centres in the Early Middle Ages and the Nassau-Diez family was for the most part the lordly rulers. In Elben (1417 Uff der Elben), once a lordly village along the Elbbach, the N√ºssel von M√∂llingen family was favoured with a Westerburg fief about 1450. In the coat of arms, the three bends with three golden orbs recall both noble families. Kaden (1559 zu Keuthen) consisted of several farms. at least one of which belonged to the von Brambach family. Their arms, the red bend sinister in the community's coat of arms stands for Kaden, Elben and the von Brambach family. In the constituent community of Grube Anna, there was brown coal pit mining until 1924. The mining charges in the community's coat of arms, inverted and per saltire in silver a red hammer and sledge, stand for Grube Anna. The three constituent communities are also symbolized by the three bends and three golden orbs. The Elbbach, which flows through the municipal area from north to south, on which the community is built and which is Elben's namesake, is shown in the arms as wavy bendlets inside the bend sinister. The tinctures red and silver witness Kaden's allegiance to the Electorate of Trier from 1564 to 1802. Thereafter, Kaden passed to the Duchy of Nassau and as of 1866, Prussia as part of the province of Hesse-Nassau. This is shown in the arms by the Nassau tinctures of blue and gold. The tight connection of the three Triertschlandgemeinden, Kaden and its neighbours H√§rtlingen and K√∂lbingen, within the parish of K√∂lbingen-M√∂llingen is also expressed in the three communities‚Äô arms, all of which contain the charges of the lesser noble families who once held sway here along the Elbbach.

The game is played on \\"a colourful hand- painted world map the size of a basketball court\\".Archive of original Global Change Game Website It is a simulation that involves exploring, understanding and solving some of the global issues of its time. Gameplay A large map of the world is laid out. The game involves approximately 70 participants (depending on the size of the venue). Each participant is randomly assigned to one of ten regions in the world: North America, Latin America, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, The Middle East, India, Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific Rim. Each player represents roughly 100 million people. Each region begins with realistic assets and problems. North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim are relatively wealthy, for example, while India and Africa have greater levels of poverty. Each region selects a leader, who is given a vest, tie, and hat to identify themselves. Tokens representing access to food, health care and employment are distributed to players based on actual global data; tokens representing industries and natural resources are placed in each region; and leaders are given tokens representing their region's money and military power and their own personal wealth. The Game typically lasts about three hours, covering 30 to 40 years of simulated time. During the Game, players are challenged to develop their economies to provide food, health care and employment for everyone, and to solve environmental problems facing their regions. Players who lack food, health care, or employment are periodically given black arm bands for each of these \\"necessities of life\\" that they are missing; any player who receives three black arm bands will be declared dead. Income and pollution arising from industries are distributed periodically, and population growth will occur in some regions, placing additional pressure on economies and resources. Players trade resources among themselves and invest money in industries or in creative solutions to problems facing their regions. While the game is in play, facilitators move around the map to work with the players to determine whether the players' proposals for regional policies are feasible or not, and to assess the consequences. For example, failure to deal with deforestation or soil erosion may lead to consequences for food production, or failure to control pollution may have consequences for health. Global problems such as global warming may also affect the course of events. Leaders can also choose to declare war; victory is determined by the number of military tokens deployed, but if nuclear weapons are used, serious global consequences result. Issues The list of issues raised in the game is as follows: * Hunger * Health and Nutrition * Sustainable Development * International Relations * Deforestation * Desertification * Agricultural practices * Resource consumption * Population growth * War * Pollution * International trade * Economic disparity * Biodiversity * Ozone Depletion * Climate Change * Energy alternatives * Gender issues * Resource Distribution * Refugees and immigration * Geography * Education Use in research In a 1994 study by American-Canadian psychologist Bob Altemeyer, 68 subjects chosen as demonstrating high levels of right-wing authoritarianism played a three-hour version of the Global Change Game, and were compared to a comparison game played by individuals with low RWA scores.Altemeyer, B. (1996). [The Authoritarian Specter. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. The game played by those with low scores resulted in world peace and widespread international cooperation. Seven men and three women made themselves team leader \\"Elites\\", and the Elites agreed to meet for talks on \\"the Island Paradise of Tasmania\\" whenever an international crisis arose. The three superpowers favored nuclear disarmament at the start of the game, and no wars occurred during the game. When an ozone layer depletion crisis arose, the world's Elites contributed sufficient money to resolve the problem through technology. The game ended with 400 million deaths to disease and starvation in India and Africa, but Altemeyer considered it \\"actually a highly successful run of the game, compared to most\\". In the simulation played by authoritarians, all eight Elite roles were taken by men. The game quickly became highly militarised, with no countries choosing to disarm their nuclear weapons. The game opened with the Elite from the Middle East doubling oil prices, and the Soviet Union investing in armies to invade North America. The North American Elites retaliated with nuclear weapons, instantly ending the game in a nuclear holocaust. When this happens in the game, the facilitators turn off the lights in the room and explain the consequences of the nuclear war, before giving the players a \\"second chance\\", turning the game clock back two years. The Soviet Union invaded China instead of the United States, and nuclear war remained a threat for the remainder of the game. Africa and Asia collapsed having spent their resources buying into alliances, and by the end of the game 1.7 billion people had died. Elites in both games had the option to siphon their country's funds to private accounts, with a prize being given at the end of the game to \\"World's Richest Person\\". The Elites in the high-RWA group siphoned more than twice the amount that the low-RWA group had, and Altemeyer attributed the disparity in game outcomes to this, as well as a tendency for high-RWAs to care more about their own group than outsiders.

SES-8 was successfully launched on SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 on 3 December 2013, 22:41:00 UTC.SatBeams: SES-8 It was the first flight of any SpaceX launch vehicle to a supersynchronous transfer orbit, an orbit with a somewhat larger apogee than the more usual Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) typically utilised for communication satellites.  Satellite  The SES-8 satellite is built on the STAR-2.4 satellite bus by Orbital Sciences. It is the sixth satellite of that model to be built for SES. The communications satellite is initially co- located at 95.0¬∞ East with NSS-6 in order to provide communications bandwidth growth capacity in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically aimed at high-growth markets in South Asia and Indo-China, \\"as well as provide expansion capacity for DTH, VSAT and government applications\\".  Specifications  * Payload mass: * Electrical power: 5 kW, using Gallium arsenide solar panels, and two lithium-ion storage batteries * Battery backup: 4850 Watt-hour lithium-ion battery * Service life: 15 years  Launch vehicle  The launch of Falcon 9 v1.1 with SES-8 from Cape Canaveral on 3 December 2013. The launch of SES-8 was the seventh launch of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, and the second launch of the Falcon 9 v1.1. SES is paying a discounted price ‚Äî \\"well under USD 60 million\\" ‚Äî for the launch since it is the inaugural geostationary launch on the Falcon 9. When originally contracted, in 2011 the putative launch date was early 2013. The launch was the second launch of the Falcon 9 v1.1 version of the rocket, a longer rocket with 60% more thrust than the Falcon 9 v1.0 vehicle, and the first launch of the larger v1.1 rocket using the rebuilt erector structure at SpaceX' Cape Canaveral SLC-40. As a result, a number of systems on the launch vehicle was flown for only the second time, while several parts of the ground infrastructure at Cape Canaveral were used in a launch for the first time. These include: * second use of the upgraded Merlin 1D engines, generating approximately 56% more sea-level thrust than the Merlin 1C engines used on the first five Falcon 9 flights * second use of the significantly longer rocket stages, which were lengthened to accommodate the larger propellant tanks needed to carry propellant for the more powerful engines. The tanks are 60% longer, making the rocket more susceptible to bending during flight. * the nine Merlin 1D engines on the first stage are arranged in an octagonal pattern with eight engines in a circle and the ninth in the center * second launch to have a jettisonable payload fairing, which has the risk of an additional separation event that has doomed many missions in the past. Fairing design was done by SpaceX, with production of the long, -diameter fairing done in Hawthorne, California at the SpaceX rocket factory. Testing of the new fairing design, first required on the CASSIOPE flight (the sixth flight of the Falcon 9), was done at NASA's Plum Brook Station where acoustic shock and mechanical vibration of launch, plus electromagnetic static discharge conditions, were tested on a full-size fairing test article in a very large vacuum chamber. SpaceX paid NASA US$581296 to lease test time in the US$150 million NASA simulation chamber facility. * second flight of the vehicle with upgraded avionics and flight software. In order to maximize the propellant available for the launch of SES-8 into GTO, SpaceX did not attempt a controlled descent test of the first-stage booster as they did on the previous Falcon 9 v1.1 flight in September 2013.  Second-stage reignition  In the previous launch of the Falcon 9 v1.1 ‚Äî the first launch of the much larger version of the rocket with new Merlin 1D engines ‚Äî on 29 September 2013, SpaceX was unsuccessful in reigniting the second stage Merlin 1D vacuum engine once the rocket had deployed its primary payload (CASSIOPE) and all of its nanosat secondary payloads. The restart failure was determined to be frozen igniter fluid lines in the second-stage Merlin 1D engine. A minor redesign was done to address the problem by adding additional insulation to the lines. A second burn of the upper stage was required, and was completed successfully, during the SES-8 missionhttp://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/12/spacex-falcon-9-v1-1-milestone- ses-8-launch/ in order to place the SES-8 telecommunications satellite into the highly elliptical supersynchronous orbit for satellite operator SES to effect a plane change and orbit circularisation. The Falcon 9 upper stage used to launch SES-8 was left in a decaying elliptical low-Earth orbit which, by September 2014, had decayed and re-entered the atmosphere.  Prelaunch  Both stages of the Falcon 9 arrived at Cape Canaveral for processing before 2 October 2013, after both had trouble-free test firings at the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility at McGregor, Texas. A launch attempt on 25 November 2013, with a planned liftoff at 22:37:00 UTC was scrubbed following a reported off-nominal condition in the liquid oxygen tank and supply lines of the first-stage booster that could not be resolved within the approximately one-hour launch window. A launch date of 28 November 2013 was announced, three days later, being the next opportunity for the launch site on Earth to be in alignment to achieve the target orbit.

Radio occultation (RO) is a remote sensing technique used for measuring the physical properties of a planetary atmosphere or ring system. Atmospheric radio occultation Atmospheric radio occultation relies on the detection of a change in a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is occulted by the atmosphere. When electromagnetic radiation passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the refraction depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric limb path. At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the Doppler shift of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index by using an Abel transform on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity. In the case of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere's temperature, pressure and water vapour content can be derived giving radio occultation data applications in meteorology. GNSS radio occultation GNSS radio occultation (GNSS-RO), historically also known as GPS radio occultation (GPS-RO or GPSRO), is a type of radio occultation that relies on radio transmissions from GPS (Global Positioning System), or more generally from GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), satellites.Melbourne et al. 1994. The application of spacebourne GPS to atmospheric limb sounding and global change monitoring. Publication 94-18, Jet Propulsion LaboratoryKursinski et al. 1997. Observing the Earth's atmosphere with radio occultation measurements using the Global Positioning System. J. Geophys. Res. 102:23.429-23.465. This is a relatively new technique (first applied in 1995) for performing atmospheric measurements. It is used as a weather forecasting tool, and could also be harnessed in monitoring climate change. The technique involves a low- Earth orbit satellite receiving a signal from a GPS satellite. The signal has to pass through the atmosphere and gets refracted along the way. The magnitude of the refraction depends on the temperature and water vapor concentration in the atmosphere. GPS Radio occultation amounts to an almost instantaneous depiction of the atmospheric state. The relative position between the GPS satellite and the low-Earth orbit satellite changes over time, allowing for a vertical scanning of successive layers of the atmosphere. GPSRO observations can also be conducted from aircraft. or on high mountaintops.

She is reputed to be the daughter of Chloderic, King of the Ripuarian Franks and the sister of Munderic, making her a princess of the Ripuarian Franks. History Doda lived in Reims in the 6th century, she was the second abbess of Saint-Pierre-les-Dames in Reims. There is some confusion regarding her parentage. Flodoard, in his Historia ecclesi√¶ Remensis says she was a niece of Balderic, Abbot of Montfaucon and Beuve, founders of the Abbey of Saint-Pierre-les-Dames de Reims and children of a king Sigebert. Flodoard identifies this king as Sigebert I (c. 535 ‚Äì c. 575), king of Austrasia, when perhaps it is, in fact, Sigobert the Lame (died c. 509), king of Cologne. Although Doda is reputed to be the daughter of Sigobert's son Chlodoric, chronologically, it seems difficult to make of Doda a daughter of Chlod√©ric. She would more likely be Sigobert the Lame's granddaughter, the daughter of a younger sister of Chloderic, born some time shortly before their father's death.\\"At that time, it is rare for a king to live long enough to see a granddaughter reach the age of marriage. This second King Sigebert is probably Sigebert I, king of Austrasia from 561 to 575. This places the date of birth of Doda at the earliest in 545, knowing that her mother, if she is the daughter of Sigebert the Lame is born at the latest in 507. It remains chronologically possible.\\" Doda is raised by her aunt, Beuve. Later, she was promised in marriage to a lord of the court of Sigebert I, but Doda refused the marriage. The lord tried to abduct her, but died as a result of a fall from his horse during the attempt. Dode then took refuge in her aunt's abbey. She succeeded Beuve as abbess. At the end of her life, she obtained from Pepin of Landen, an act designed to protect her community. She is venerated in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

The reserve is near the village Breinigerberg, 15 kilometres from Aachen or 7 kilometres distant from the city of Stolberg (Rhineland). Schlangenberg itself is a small hill peaking 276 m above sea level. The 108 hectares large area is famous for its calamine flora.  Geology  The soil of the nature reserve is basically limestone which was precipitated about 400 million years ago by an ancient ocean. In the following million years geological movements carried it to the surface where erosion removed large amounts. About 200 million years ago aqueous metal solutions filled the cavernous rocks. Primary ores were created mostly consisting of Sphalerite, Marcasite and Galena. The process continued and the ore close to the surface decomposed due to the influence of carbon dioxide and water. In this process as a secondary ore calamine ZnCO3 which is known as calamine developed.  History  Presumably the Celts had been the first digging for the calamine in the region. Ancient Celtic and Roman coins dated between 100 BC and 92/93 AD as well as remains of a Roman settlement proved the interest in the ore which was mostly used for weapons and vessels. The greatest interest in calamine had been in the 18th century when brass manufactures settled in Stolberg (Rhineland). For the production of the alloy they needed large amounts of calamine which was melted together with copper. Before 1800 digging small reaching only surface based ore was the only technique available to the miners. In the 19th century mining changed and more than 20 adits enabled the workers to reach calamine up to 105 m below the surface. During this time the Schlangenberg-area was perforated like a Swiss cheese. More than 700 miners worked at the mining shafts. During this time calamine was spread in the whole area and the poisonous metals zinc and lead contaminated large areas. In 1871 the Franco-prussian war stopped working on the ore fields and after an attempted restart mining was given up 1883. A renaturation of the Schlangenberg was never attempted. For many years it was even used by the military for their maneuvers. Nature regained control of the Schlangenberg and in 1990 the Schlangenberg Nature Reserve was founded to protect the unique calamine flora and fauna from destruction.  Flora  Viola calaminaria The soil of the nature reserve contains large amounts of calamine, poisonous for most plants. Only specialist plants are able to grow under these conditions. Therefore, the flora is unique to calamine and can only be found in a few other areas worldwide. The most typical plants are Viola calaminaria and Thlaspi calaminare. Many tourists visit the reserve for these flowers each year. Beside these plants other specialists found on the toxic floor are: Armeria maritima ssp. elongata, Festuca aquisgranensis, Silene vulgaris ssp. humilis or Minuartia verna ssp. hercynica. On some hidden parts of the reserve orchids like the dark red helleborine (Epipactis atrorubens) the fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera) and many others grow year by year.  Fauna  The Schlangenberg reserve is famous for its butterflies. More than 300 different kinds have been found there. Some have specialist on calamine resistant plants. Endangered locusts like the wart-biters belong to the important animals. The Coronella austriaca that give the Schlangenberg its name (snake- mountain) can occasionally be found in the reserve. The woodlark, an endangered species in Germany, as well as the red-backed shrike live in the reserve in large quantities. The Biologischen Station im Kreis Aachen e. V. a governmental group of environmental specialists has tried to resettle the yellow-bellied toad.  Threats to the nature reserve  Although the toxic ground prevents most plants from growing in this area some seems to be resistant to the poison. Pines would destroy most of the nature reserve within a short time and the Biologischen Station im Kreis Aachen e. V. together with volunteers spent a lot of time cutting pines and reducing their numbers. The attractive flora and fauna also causes problems as the visitors of the nature reserve destroy al lot by leaving the hiking trails. To deliver further information to the interested visitors a local group had founded a museum presenting detailed information about the Schlangenberg, its past as a mining area, exhibits of animals and flowers as well as plenty of photos.

He is called al-Asmar because he stayed up most of the night in prayer.The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic Page 501 Edited by JM. Cowan, Spoken Languages Services Inc. Ithaca, NY Life Sidi Abd As- Salam Al-Asmar was born as Salim Al-Fayturi in 1455 (ca. 859 AH) in the small city of Zliten, Libya, which is located roughly east of Tripoli near Leptis Magna. He belonged to the Fawatir tribe, while the nickname al-Asmar was given to him by his mother, who is believed to have been ordered to do so in a dream.Bosworth, Clifford Edmund, The Encyclopedia of Islam, New Edition: Supplement, Volumes 7-8, p.93. He received his early mystical training from Abd al-Wahid al-Dukali, a khalifa of the Shadhili 'Arusi order who initiated him into the tariqa. Al-Asmar lived as a zahid (ascetic), alone in Libya's vast desert performing various types of miracles for those in need. Later in life he became a mujahid (holy warrior), taking up arms in defense of his city. He died in 1575 at the age of 120 and his tomb became a place of pilgrimage, a large masjid was constructed in his remembrance at the location surrounding his grave. Not far from the masjid is one of the most respected and renowned Quranic educational institutions (madrasah) in Libya, named Al- Jamiaa Al-Asmariya ( i.e. Al-Asmariya Islamic University). A small archaeological museum contains various frescoes from the villa of Dar Buc Ammera and a collection of ceramic Roman artifacts belonging to the various tombs found on the peripheries. On the anniversary of the destruction of tombs of the Al-Baqi' graveyard, the mosque and grave of Al-Asmar was reportedly destroyed on August 24, 2012 by Salafis and Wahhabis on the pretext that Islam does not allow worshipping graves and the dead (Reuters).

To the left of Captain Nadich (originally from Baltimore, Maryland), hidden by his right arm, is Captain Gershon Levi, from Montreal, Canada, a Rabbi with the Canadian forces. He had previously offered the prayer over the bread. On the right of the photograph is Colonel Moses Strock from Boston, Massachusetts. Rabbi Judah Nadich (May 13, 1912 - August 26, 2007), was a Conservative rabbi, who served congregations in Buffalo, New York and Chicago, Illinois, and later was the U.S. Army's senior Jewish chaplain in Europe while Allied forces were liberating Nazi concentration camps, and later was the President of the Rabbinical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the eldest child of Isaac and Lena Nathanson Nadich, who had emigrated from Russia in the early 1900s. His father owned a grocery store. Rabbi Nadich's mother died when he was 7, and he and his two sisters were raised by their stepmother, Nettie Gifter Nadich, an immigrant from Lithuania. Isaac and Nettie also had a daughter together. In 1936, four years after graduating from City College of New York, Rabbi Nadich earned a master's degree in history from Columbia University and was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He led Conservative congregations in Buffalo and in Chicago before enlisting in the Army as a chaplain in 1942. \\"In 1945, when he was a lieutenant colonel in the Army and its senior Jewish chaplain in Europe, and when the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps were being fully revealed, Rabbi Nadich was named to the new post of Jewish adviser to [General] Dwight Eisenhower \\"to offer advice on how to cope with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons being kept in military custody in squalid conditions little better than the camps they had survived. In a 1953 book, Eisenhower and the Jews, Rabbi Nadich wrote that he and others persuaded the Allied command to abandon a policy requiring the displaced to be returned to their home countries.\\" In 1947, Rabbi Nadich married Martha Hadassah Ribalow, the daughter of Menachem Ribalow, founder and editor of the first Hebrew weekly in America, Hadoar, and Rose Ribalow. He served at Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline, Massachusetts, for 10 years, and then, from 1957 until his retirement in 1987, he served as rabbi of New York's Park Avenue Synagogue. There, Nadich \\"helped develop a strong educational after- school program, which is now called the Rabbi Judah Nadich Hebrew High School.\\" As President of the Rabbinical Assembly, in 1974, he called on the movement's Law Committee to \\"give careful consideration\\" to his proposal to admit ordained women, which eventually occurred in 1985.

Born in Lomita, California, and of Yugoslav descent (described variously as Slovenian,Spink, J.G.Taylor, and Rickert, Paul, 1949 Official Baseball Register. St. Louis, Missouri: The Sporting News, 1949, page 209. Croatian and Serb-Montenegrin), he was listed as tall and . Three brothers (Alex, Ambrose \\"Bo\\" and Nick) played minor league baseball. At 17, Palica was the youngest player in the National League during 1945 at the time of his April debut with two pinch-running appearances for the Dodgers. (He did not score any runs in games played April 21 and 29, both against the rival New York Giants). He then began honing his skills as a pitcher in the minors, before returning to Brooklyn for three late-season mound appearances for the pennant-bound 1947 Dodgers. He spent the full seasons of 1948‚Äì51 with the Dodger varsity, getting into 152 games, most of them in relief. During his best season, 1950, he made 19 starts, won 13 of 21 decisions, and threw 10 complete games with two shutouts. He appeared in the 1949 World Series, throwing two shutout innings in relief against the New York Yankees in a losing cause during the Yanks' Game 5 clincher. But 1951 was a terrible season on the field for Palica. On July 18, brought in to face the lowly Pittsburgh Pirates with the Dodgers behind 10‚Äì6 in the fifth inning, Palica held the fort, allowing one run over three innings while the Dodgers overcame the deficit and went ahead, 12‚Äì11, in their half of the sixth. But in the eighth frame, Palica could not hold the lead, allowing a solo home run to slugger Ralph Kiner and an RBI single to former Dodger star Pete Reiser. Pittsburgh went on to a 13‚Äì12 triumph, and, after the game‚Äîwhich had featured angry battles between the Dodgers and the umpiring crew‚ÄîBrooklyn manager Chuck Dressen lost his temper and witheringly questioned Palica's courage in \\"on the record\\" remarks to the assembled media. Having lost confidence in Palica, Dressen used him in only four more games and 4 innings pitched in August 1951. Palica did not pitch after August 27, as the archrival Giants roared back from a 13-game mid-August deficit to tie the Dodgers and force a playoff, which they won on Bobby Thomson's famous walk-off homer. By that point, Palica was in the United States Army performing military service during the Korean War. He missed the 1952‚Äì53 seasons completely, and returned in 1954 to appear in 25 games for new Dodger manager Walter Alston, most of them as a reliever. During the offseason of 1954‚Äì55, he was traded to the Orioles, a second-division American League team that gave Palica a chance to reclaim a starting pitcher role. He got into 62 games over two seasons with Baltimore, 39 as a starter, but posted only a 9‚Äì22 record. During his big- league career, Palica allowed 806 hits and 399 bases on balls in 839 innings pitched. He struck out 423, threw 20 complete games and three shutouts, and was credited with a dozen saves. Palica spent the final seven seasons of his pro career (1957‚Äì63) back in the minors, winning 15 games three different times in the top-level Pacific Coast League. In retirement, Palica worked as a longshoreman in Southern California, and died from a heart attack at age 54 in Huntington Beach.

In addition the Charvel Jackson Guitar company released the Surfcaster in 1991 with advertising and public relations featuring Steve Cropper as an official endorsee. The Surfcaster has been considered a boutique style guitar that employs many retro styles from leading manufacturers of the fifties and sixties. These design aspects make it significantly different from other models by Charvel/Jackson that focused mainly on the hard rock guitarist. The Surfcaster was picked as a \\"Pawn Shop Prize\\" by Guitar Player magazine in July 2003. Sound and playability The Surfcaster guitar is typically known for its twang and was originally targeted to the Surf Rock and Country music guitar player. The low output Chandler lipstick pickups contribute to the open airy sound. Later models with humbucker pickups appealed to Metal and Pop guitarists. Design Originally available only in the two lipstick pickup configuration, later models would include a humbucking pickup in the bridge position. Later solid body 3 lipstick pickup variations were also produced. A twelve string and four string bass version were also created and are highly collectible. A double neck 12 string/6 string model was made in very small numbers and is now also highly collectible. In later years the Surfcaster was released under the Jackson brand name and production facilities changed from Japan to Indonesia. Quality & cosmetics suffered.

Planet Relief was a proposed BBC television special dealing with the issue of global warming, originally scheduled for broadcast in January 2008. The programme, which had been in development for 18 months, was meant to be similar to previous BBC programmes such as Comic Relief and Sport Relief. However, it was cancelled before it was broadcast, allegedly because the BBC was concerned that it would be \\"biased\\" towards promoting responses based on acceptance of mainstream climate change science. Concept The original idea for Planet Relief was to increase awareness of climate change. The show, unlike previous BBC specials such as Comic Relief, was not planned to be a charity event, but to increase awareness, similar to Live Earth. It was mainly inspired by Live 8, with Planet Relief seen as its climate change counterpart. The programme would have involved an electric power station being shut down for one night, for which the BBC had spent over a year negotiating, urging viewers \\"to turn off all unnecessary lights and electric gadgets for the evening.\\" Cancellation The BBC scrapped the idea for Planet Relief on 5 September 2007. Peter Barron, editor of Newsnight said, \\"It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet.\\" Peter Horrocks, head of BBC television news said, \\"It is not the BBC's job to lead opinion or proselytise on this or any other subject.\\" There were also concerns that the power station shutdown \\"might overload parts of the [electricity distribution] network.\\" The BBC did not, however, say that the show was cancelled due to bias, stating rather that, \\"The BBC is committed to programmes about climate change but after Live Earth what audiences say is they are looking for programmes of a documentary or factual nature to explain the complex subject.\\" Right wing commentators opposed the idea of Planet Relief. Complaints about the programme also came from climate sceptics such as Martin Durkin, who said, \\"The thing that disturbs me most is that the BBC has such a leviathan position ‚Ä¶ that if it decides that it is going to adopt climate change as a moral purpose, I have got a lot of trouble with that. I don't think it is the role of the BBC to spend my money on a moral purpose.\\" For their part, climate change activists attacked the BBC for cancelling the programme. Author Mark Lynas said, \\"This decision shows a real poverty of understanding among senior BBC executives about the gravity of the situation we face. The only reason why this became an issue is that there is a small but vociferous group of climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance.\\" Another critic, Friends of the Earth executive director Tony Juniper, said, \\"This is a very disappointing decision considering the huge potential for the BBC in helping us more quickly make the shift toward a low-carbon society. The science of climate change is very clear and if approached in the right way taking up this very serious issue would not compromise the BBC' impartiality.\\" See also * BBC controversies * Criticism of the BBC * List of television series cancelled before airing an episode * Media bias * Denmark plants trees * Climate change References Category:Unaired television shows Category:Environmental controversies Category:Media bias controversies ","title":"Planet Relief"},{"id":"13108497","text":"Perch filets showing myomere structure Myomere are the blocks of skeletal muscle tissue found commonly in chordates.

Gate at Naval Air Station Barber's Point as it appeared in December 1958 Attack on Pearl Harbor On December 7, 1941, Barbers Point was one of the many targets attacked by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor. During the second wave, American pilots George Welch and Kenneth Taylor engaged Japanese aircraft, shooting down two aircraft. The Navy acquired the airfield in early 1943. At that time it consisted of two short runways and four hangars that were just two feet above hightide. A PNAB civilian contractor started work by bringing a dredge onto Keehi lagoon in February 1943. In April the military took over. The Army took over the dredging operation while Seabees of the 5th Naval Construction Battalion took over the airfield.Building the Navys Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and Civil Engineering Corps, 1940-46, Chapter XXII, Pearl Harbor, part 1, Oahu, p.142 When they were done there would be three runways. The Navy would turn the airfield into a major facility by sending Seabees from the 13th, 64th and 133rd Construction Battalions to do it. Closing NAS Barbers Point was closed by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action in the 1999, with the Navy aircraft, primarily P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft assigned to squadrons of Patrol Wing Two, relocating to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, now Marine Corps Base Hawaii, on the other side of the island. However, Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point, with its complement of HH-65 Dolphin helicopters and HC-130H Hercules aircraft, remained after the Navy's departure. Also, in 1972 the United States Army posted a CH-47 Chinook company, the 147th ASHC \\"Hillclimbers\\", supporting the Army's 25th Inf Div and USARPAC, and it was moved to the historic Wheeler Army Airfield, Schofield Barracks, for Hawaii Army National Guard use. Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point is the only Coast Guard Air Station within the 14th United States Coast Guard District. With the closure of NAS Barbers Point, the present day Kalaeloa Airport / John Rodgers Field is also home to Naval Air Museum Barbers Point, which preserves the history of the base and also has a collection of aircraft that reflect the US Navy's, US Marine Corps', US Coast Guard's and US Army's aviation presence on Barbers Point and in the state of Hawaii. Production studio By early 2017, the massive building which once served as the air station's aircraft intermediate maintenance facility had been leased by Navy Region Hawaii to the Hawaiian Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism and the Hawaii State Film Office for use as a film and television studio. The Hawaii State Film Office had been interested in developing space on the former airfield into a filming studio to complement the department's first studio, the Hawaii Film Studio at Diamond Head in East Oahu. Donne Dawson, commissioner of the Hawaii State Film Office, stated that the new facility would \\"have all the components of a film office, such as office space for all departments, space for their props and wardrobes and a mill for set construction,\\" and noted that, had Navy Region Hawaii not agreed to the lease, \\"there were not a lot of options\\" available to interested production companies beyond retrofitting warehouse space. ABC Studios and Marvel Television's Inhumans was the first production to use the newly created production facility.

Tool An underbucking tool can be made using an ax driven into the side of the log so that a crosscut saw can be turned upside down. A special tool designed specifically for underbucking facilitates the job of cutting from the ground upwards. The underbuck tool is driven into the section of the log which is considered to be least likely of moving once the cut has been successfully made. The crosscut saw's backside rides along the pulley that rests on the bar driven into the log. As the sawyer draws the saw backward, the sawyer may apply leverage downward and the pulley will redirect the force upward into the wood. Some underbuck cuts are made part way and finished with a cut from the top. References Sources *http://www.enotes.com/topic/Underbucking * Miller, Warren. Crosscut Saw Manual.

It was incorporated into the Belgian honours system following the annexation of the Congo Free State by Belgium. The motto of the order is Travail et progr√®s (\\"Labour and progress\\"). The King of the Belgians is its Grand Master. The Royal Order of the Lion was awarded by Royal Decree. Following the independence of Congo-L√©opoldville in 1960, the Royal Order of the Lion is no longer awarded.

Geography Isbergues is situated about northwest of B√©thune and west of Lille at the junction of the D186, D187 and the D91 roads and by the banks of the Canal d‚ÄôAire. On 1 January 1996, the former communes of Molinghem, Berguette and Isbergues were consolidated into a single commune and took the name of Isbergues. History Saint Isbergues‚Äô well The town was first known for the legend of St. Isbergues, the daughter of Pepin the Short and the sister of Charlemagne, who could supposedly cure diseases of the skin and eyes. The town has experienced strong industrial development from the mid-19th century, thanks to the proximity of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais coal deposits. The steel industry has benefitted from the use of the vast spaces besides the Canal d‚ÄôAire, which connects the town to the English Channel and the North Sea via the De√ªle and the canals of northern Europe to the east. The area is also served by railway. The metal industry has marked the landscape and was a source of significant pollution, but it also made the fortunes of the town. The steelworks still employed 410 people in 2006. The Mittal company has pledged 2.5 million euros over three years as part of a revitalization plan. Several other industrial projects are planned for the commune in 2008.

The Grand Prix d'Isbergues is a cycling race first created in 1945 through the district of Pont-Balque. The town has organised events since 1947. This is the only exclusively professional cycling race in the department. It is ranked 1.1 by the Union Cycliste Internationale and is scheduled for the UCI Europe Tour. It is also registered as a qualifier for the Coupe de France. The Grand Prix d'Isbergues has experienced great champions such as Jacques Anquetil, Poulidor, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond.

He also painted portraits and still lifes with trompe-l'≈ìil effects. Life Bernardo Germ√°n de Ll√≥rente was born and died in Seville.

Diccionario hist√≥rico de los m√°s ilustres profesores de las Bellas Artes en Espa√±a, tomo II, Madrid, p. 182-184 He learned from his master to adequately imitate the palette of Murillo. Father Isidoro de Sevilla, a capuchin missionary, commissioned from him a Virgin in shepherd dress. This painting brought him fame and many similar requests. He so frequently painted the Virgin Mary as a shepherdess that he was called the ‚Äúpainter of shepherdesses ('el pintor de las pastoras'). In these works he showed himself such a faithful follower of Murillo that his Divine shepherdess in the Prado Museum was for years believed to have been painted by Murillo.Llorente, Bernardo Germ√°n at the Prado Museum Wine or Allegory of taste When the Spanish court was residing in Sevilla c. 1730, he was asked by Queen Isabel Farnese to paint a portrait of her son Don Philip. The Portrait of Don Philip at about age 10 shows him dressed in the fashion of the time, in a red coat with rich silver embroidery, the stars of the Holy Spirit and an azure blue sash. The work shows the influence of the Bourbon court painter Jean Ranc, whom Llorente had the opportunity to meet during his stay in Seville.Retrato del Infante D. Felipe at the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville The Queen was so happy with the portrait that she gave him several gifts, including Fran√ßois Boucher's set of prints of the Battle of Alexandria. Ll√≥rente was called to Madrid by Philip V, who desired to make him court painter. He declined the honor, preferring an independent life. In 1735, he was inducted into the Academia Real de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Llorente was known for his trompe-l'≈ìil still lifes, a genre that was quite popular in Andalusia at the time. An example is the Wine or the Allegory of taste at the Louvre. This composition contains several symbols of wine and taste. The engraving on the wall is signed by Pedro de Campolargo, a Flemish painter and engraver who worked first in Antwerp and then in Seville from 1640.

The original LP release included the UK chart hits: \\"It's Going to Happen!\\", which reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1981, and an album version of \\"Julie Ocean\\", which reached number 41 upon release in July the same year. Although the majority of the songs contained upon this album were largely inspired by the same subjects as the songs upon the two previous albums released by the band at this stage in their career (both of which generally contained lyrical matter concerning teenage angst), Positive Touch was the first and only album released by the Undertones to contain songs which drew lyrical inspiration from the Troubles relating to the political and social background in which the members of the band had been born and raised. The single \\"It's Going to Happen!\\" was directly inspired by the 1981 hunger strikes in Northern Ireland and was performed on Top of the Pops on the day one of the participants in these hunger strikes, Bobby Sands, died. Three further songs upon the LP (\\"You're Welcome\\", \\"Crisis of Mine\\" and \\"Sigh and Explode\\") were also lyrically inspired by the Troubles, although none of the material the band were to subsequently release drew influence from these sources. Background The majority of the songs released upon Positive Touch were more experimental than the band's previous material, with instruments such as pianos, recorders, and brass instruments added to the group's sound. Guitarist Damian O'Neill recalled: \\"We'd moved away from the Ramones. Dexys was my thing.

History  The Collection of the Miniature Museum is based on the private collection of Ria and Lex Daniels, Amsterdam art collectors and retired gallery owners. In the late 70s, the Daniels began to collect miniature artworks for their private collection. These works were initially displayed on a wall in their private home, but a renovation pushed them to reconsider what to do with their collection. What started out as a spontaneous idea, quickly turned into a serious endeavor, and by 1990 they had devised a plan for a miniature museum. The Miniature Museum was officially established in 1990. In the following three decades, a large number of artists were invited to contribute to the growing collection of the Miniature Museum. Since early on, the museum has been linked to the Medical Cancer Research Foundation, supporting the foundation with donations. On December 2, 1997 the mayor of Amsterdam opened the miniature museum at the pediatric oncology department at the AMC hospital in Amsterdam Zuid-oost. From 2013 to 2018, the Miniature Museum was housed in the Kunstmuseum Den Haag. A new building was specifically built to house the miniature collection. The exhibition in the new building was curated by the Daniels in close collaboration with the Dutch curator Wim van Sinderen. Due to the size of the miniature collection, which ranged in the 2000s, a part of the collection could not be displayed at the Kunstmuseum Den Haag. Instead, the Haags Historisch Museum exhibited this part of the collection from 2017 to 2018.  Collection  The collection of the Miniature Museum consists of around 2000 miniature artworks by more than 1050 artists, who have made an artwork especially for the museum. Two-dimensional works in the collection generally measure between 10 x 10 cm and 9 x 12 cm, while sculptures are limited to 10 x 10 x 20 cm. Nevertheless, a few exceptions have been made. The museum has works by internationally recognized artists, including Arman, C√©sar, Daniel Spoerri, Jonathan Lasker, Edward Kienholz, Sam Francis, Christo, Dennis Oppenheim, Sol LeWitt, George Baselitz, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mangold, Jenny Holzer, Annie Leibovitz, Sandro Chia, A.R. Penck, Andres Serrano, Karel Appel, Carl Andre, Panamarenko, Robert Longo, Kenny Scharf, G√ºnther F√∂rg, Allen Jones, Bettina Rheims, Ed Rucha, Richard Artschwager, Tetsumi Kudo, Peter Halley, Marlene Dumas, Keith Haring, Anton Corbijn, Louise Bourgeois, Peter Beard, Imi Knoebel, Damien Hirst, Lawrence Weiner, David Levinthal, and many more.Miniature Museum Invitation 2018 The collection‚Äôs recent acquisitions include works by Ali Banisadr, Anish Kapoor, Angel Otero, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Daido Moriyama, Donald Baechler, Enoc Perez, Erwin Olaf, Harland Miller, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Larry Bell, Martin Parr, Pat Steir, Taryn Simon, Tauba Auerbach, Tom Sachs, Urs Fischer, Yinka Shonibare, and Zhang Huan.Miniature Museum Invitation 2018  Building  The first building to house the Miniature Museum at the AMC was designed by Ria and Lex Daniels themselves. In 2013 a new building was built in context of the Miniature Museum‚Äôs exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. It was inspired and based on an early design by Theo van Doesburg of the Dutch art movement De Stijl and was constructed by the exhibition architects Kossman DeJong. Visitors The museum has attracted over 1.000.000 visitors so far. All proceeds made in the sale of the catalogue have been donated to the Medical Cancer Research Foundation. Together with anonymous donations, the Miniature Museum has raised a large amount of money for the foundation. The museum is planning to publish a second volume of the catalogue in 2020. In 1997 the Miniature Museum was awarded the Guinness World Record for the smallest museum in the world. It has since been featured in the Guinness book of records as such, opposite the largest museum in the world, the Hermitage.  Trivia  The largest work in the collection is ‚ÄòJumped Up Jesus‚Äô by Edward Kienholz (42 x 13 x 17 cm). It is the only work in the collection of its size. However, for Kienholz's work which usually encompasses life-sized installation, the piece is considered a miniature. The smallest works in the collection is a stamp by Robert Longo measuring 2 x 2,5 cm and a landscape painting the size of a pin by Karel Sirag. Sirag‚Äôs work measures less than 1 cm diameter and was painted using a miniature brush. In the pre-internet days of the 80s, Carl Andre pranked the museum by sending an envelope to the museum with an accompanying letter stating to be very careful when opening the envelope as not to lose the miniature work. No matter how closely they searched, the Daniels couldn‚Äôt find the work in the envelope and feared they had lost Andre‚Äôs work with no way to contact him. A few weeks later a second letter arrived. Across the front of the envelope the words ‚ÄúJust kidding‚Äù had been printed in a large font. This time, the work was included in the envelope. Daniel Spoerri's artwork in the Miniature Museum dates from the 1990s. Exhibiting in Amsterdam at the time, the artist was approached by the Daniels about making an artwork for the collection. Pointing at his large hands, Spoerri said that that was impossible, and added that he was lacking the material to assemble one of his Tableau Pi√®ges on a miniature scale. Upon hearing this, Lex Daniels headed to a toy shop and purchased a number of small utensils for doll houses. Spoerri returned on the day before the opening with a completed Tableau Pi√®ge, which he had put together in his hotel room. Currently, the museum is thinking about organizing temporary thematic exhibitions alongside the permanent collection display.

Jackson was an important figure in the struggle for increased civil rights and workers' rights on the islands. He petitioned for freedom of the press, organized the islands' first trade union. Following the transfer of the territory to American control in 1917, he lobbied for US citizenship for the islanders. Jackson worked as an educator and later a bookkeeper and clerk before becoming involved in the politics of the Danish West Indies. He traveled to Denmark and successfully petitioned for the repeal of a 1779 law which prohibited independent newspapers and enforced strict censorship on all publications in the territory. Upon returning home, he established the first free newspaper, The Herald. The date of this event, November 1, is celebrated as an annual public holiday known as \\"Liberty Day\\", D. Hamilton Jackson Day, or Bull and Bread Day in the U.S. Virgin Islands. With the help of Ralph Bough, Jackson organized the first union in the Danish West Indies, St. Croix Labor Union, in 1913. He lobbied for the transfer of the islands to American control. After his visit, a majority of the Folketing was convinced that Danish rule over the islands should be ended.

The ship was built in the early 1910s in the context of a cooperative defensive agreement with Britain and France, as part of a naval construction program to restore the fleet after the losses of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. She was the only member of the class to be completed before the start of World War I, which significantly delayed completion of the other vessels. The ships were armed with a main battery of eight guns and were intended to support the French Navy in the event of a major European war. Because Spain remained neutral at the start of the war, Espa√±a and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid wartime service. She represented Spain at the opening of the Panama Canal in early 1915. In the late 1910s, she served in the 1st Squadron, but by 1920, the Spanish fleet had been reorganized and Espa√±a and her sisters were assigned to the Training Squadron. The ship embarked on a major cruise to South America in 1920, during which she accidentally ran aground. The accident caused significant damage that required extensive repairs before she could return to Spain. Espa√±a and the rest of the Spanish fleet supported forces fighting in the Rif War starting in 1921, and while bombarding rebel positions near Cape Tres Forcas, Morocco, in August 1923, the ship ran aground again. She could not be easily freed, though by November 1924, work on lightening the ship was nearly completed when severe storms destroyed the wreck. Some of her guns that were removed during salvage operations were used as coastal artillery as late as 1999. Design alt=The ship carries four twin-gun turrets, one centered forward, one behind and to the right side of the ship, another further behind and to the left, and the last centered aft. Numerous smaller guns are distributed along the sides of the vessel. Following the destruction of much of the Spanish fleet in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, the Spanish Navy made a series of failed attempts to begin the process of rebuilding. After the First Moroccan Crisis strengthened Spain's ties to Britain and France and public support for rearmament increased in its aftermath, the Spanish government came to an agreement with those countries for a plan of mutual defense. In exchange for British and French support for Spain's defense, the Spanish fleet would support the French Navy in the event of war with the Triple Alliance. A strengthened Spanish fleet was thus in the interests of Britain and France, which accordingly provided technical assistance in the development of modern warships, the contracts for which were awarded to the firm Spanish Sociedad Espa√±ola de Construcci√≥n Naval (SECN), which was formed by the British shipbuilders Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company. The vessels were authorized some six months after the British had completed the \\"all-big-gun\\" , and after discarding plans to build pre-dreadnought-type battleships, the naval command quickly decided to build their own dreadnoughts, the first of which was Espa√±a. Espa√±a was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of ; her freeboard was amidships. The ship displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four-shaft Parsons steam turbines driving four screw propellers, with steam provided by twelve Yarrow boilers. The engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . Espa√±a had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Her crew consisted of 854 officers and enlisted men. Espa√±a was armed with a main battery of eight 50-caliber guns, mounted in four twin gun turrets. One turret was placed forward, two were positioned en echelon amidships, and the fourth was aft of the superstructure. This mounting scheme was chosen in preference to superfiring turrets, as was done in the American s, to save weight and cost. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried a secondary battery that consisted of twenty guns mounted individually in casemates along the length of the hull. They were too close to the waterline, however, which made them unusable in heavy seas. She was also armed with four 3-pounder guns and two machine guns. Her armored belt was thick amidships; the main battery turrets were protected with the same amount of armor plate. The conning tower had thick sides. Her armored deck was thick. Service history The Navy Law of 7 January 1908 authorized construction of Espa√±a. She was laid down at the SECN shipyard in Ferrol on 6 December 1909. She was launched on 5 February 1912 and delivered on 8 September 1913, though some work continued until 23 October, when she was commissioned. That month, the French President Raymond Poincar√© visited Spain, and during his stay he came aboard Espa√±a. While aboard, he met the ship's gunnery officer, Jaime Janer R√≥binson, upon whom Poincar√© later conferred the L√©gion d'honneur in 1914 for his work developing Spanish gunnery training. R√≥binson was the Spanish Navy's leading expert on modern gunnery systems, and his appointment to Espa√±a allowed him to install the first modern fire-control system in the Spanish fleet. After conducting her shakedown cruise and initial training, the ship participated in gunnery trials in June 1914, after which the vessel was ready for service. The July Crisis that arose in the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand led to the start of World War I at the end of the month, though Italy initially declared neutrality, allowing Spain to do the same. The Italians later joined the Allies the following year, and as a result, Espa√±a and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. After she entered service, she joined the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet, where she was eventually joined by her two sister ships as they were completed. In February 1915, Espa√±a crossed the Atlantic to represent Spain at the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Since the major European navies were occupied with World War I, only Spain and Portugal sent ships to the ceremonies, along with South American fleets. After her sister entered service in mid-1915, the two battleships sailed to Santander, where King Alfonso XIII was aboard his yacht Giralda. The two battleships then took part in training exercises off Galicia. In 1920, Espa√±a was sent on a major cruise to South American waters, departing on 14 June and steaming first to the major ports in the mouth of the R√≠o de la Plata. She carried the Spanish representative to the quatercentenary of the discovery of the Straits of Magellan in Chile, in the process becoming the Spanish Navy's first ship to pass through the Panama Canal. On 29 January 1921 she ran aground in Chilean waters off Puerto Montt on her return to Spain, though she was refloated with some difficulty. Her hull was dented badly for a length of , and the rocks tore a large hole that was approximately between frames 22 and 36, and several smaller holes between frames 48 to 56 on the port side and 58 to 76 on the starboard side. Divers effected temporary repairs with concrete in Chile, followed by permanent repairs that were made in Balboa, Panama before she made her return voyage across the Atlantic. Rif War and loss alt=Three rectangular sections of thick steel lie on display in a museum Throughout the early 1920s, she provided fire support to the Spanish Army in its campaigns in Morocco during the Rif War that had broken out in mid-1921. On 17 September, she and Alfonso XIII bombarded Rif positions south of Melilla while Spanish Foreign Legion troops assaulted the positions. While conducting a bombardment off Cape Tres Forcas near Melilla on 26 August 1923, Espa√±a ran hard aground owing to heavy fog. Alfonso XIII came alongside to take off her crew before salvage operations began. The Spanish Navy hired two salvage companies to re-float the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her under normal conditions, the Navy decided to remove as much weight as possible from Espa√±a in an attempt to lighten her to permit re-floating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. Much of the battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage by 19 November, some three weeks before she was scheduled to be re-floated. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305 mm and 102 mm guns recovered from Espa√±a were later installed in coastal artillery batteries. Three of the 305 mm guns, designated the La Marquina Battery, were placed at Cadiz in single mounts in 1953; each gun was placed in a new turret mount with an enclosed gun shield atop a concrete emplacement that included a magazine, fire direction, generator, and other support rooms. Some of the batteries remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. By 2009, two of the La Marquina guns had been removed, but the third was retained as a display. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII was renamed Espa√±a in April 1931.
