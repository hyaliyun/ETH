It independently operates its own power, heat, sewage treatment, water, laundry, fire, ambulance, public safety, building maintenance, transportation and dietary services. It is run by the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services. The facility is listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. History Southbury Training School was built in the 1930s as a place to house the intellectually disabled. It is and was self-sufficient from the town of Southbury. In 1976, John Lennon donated his 1970 Oscar statuette for auction to raise money for the school - it netted $600. It was auctioned again in 1992 for $110,000 with a portion of those proceeds going to the school. In 1986, admissions to STS were closed. There was a current population of 1,111. The Department of intellectual disabilities was directed to attempt to place residents in group homes and other such settings. The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. In 1997, STS was prohibited from accepting any new residents. STS had 782 residents remaining. As of 2000, STS maintained a staff of 1,700 people. STS had 696 residents remaining. As of 2001, STS had 639 residents remaining. The average age was 55, and the average resident had been at STS for 43 years. The State intends to continue decreasing the number of residents through placement in other settings and through the death of residents. As of 2019, STS has 180 residents remaining. Conditions In 1984, the first major lawsuit regarding the conditions at STS was filed by the United States of America against the State of Connecticut. A consent decree settled the suit in 1986, requiring that the State improve the conditions of both the care and the facilities. In 1996, the United States District Court for the District of New Haven held the State in contempt of the consent decree. In 1997, an order was issued and a special master appointed to oversee the School. In 2005, Governor Rell requested the removal of David Ferleger as special master, also using the opportunity to request the removal of special masters as a whole. Without granting the state a hearing, the federal court rejected the state's request to end Mr. Ferleger's work for the court as special master. ‚ÄúAs a federally appointed \\"special master,\\" Ferleger is responsible for making sure Connecticut complies with a 10-year-old U.S. Department of Justice order to improve conditions at the facility for the intellectually disabled.

Description Cazorla lies at an elevation of 836 metres on the western slope of the Sierra de Cazorla. It is the entry point and base for visits to the Natural Park of Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park, a vast protected area of magnificent river gorges and forests. Spain's second longest river, the Guadalquivir, has its source in the mountains to the south of the settlement. Distances to nearby cities are: Ja√©n, 121 km.; Granada, 205 km.; and Linares, 71 km. See Mapa de Carreteras de Ja√©n The town is constructed around three main squares, the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, the Plaza de la Corredera (or de Huevo, \\"of the Egg\\", because of its shape), and the Plaza Santa Maria. This last square is the oldest and is connected to the other two by narrow, twisting streets. It takes its name from the old cathedral which, damaged by floods in the seventeenth century, was later burnt by French troops. It is now in ruin. Above the square sits an austere, reconstructed Moorish castle tower called La Yedra. Still higher up on the rocky escarpment lie the ruins of still yet another ruined fortress. A recommended excursion is to the nearby village of La Iruela, which has a ruined Moorish fortress perched on a daunting rock peak. A number of battles were fought here during the Reconquista until Don Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada, archbishop of Toledo, reconquered it in 1231 and made it the seat of his archbishopric. Its primitive structure is relatively intact. The principal defenses consist of a crumbling principal tower and two separate enclosures, with some of its battlements still intact, connected by a long curtain wall. These walls also protected the monastery, whose remains are still visible nearby. See Castles The history of Cazorla goes back more than two thousand years. Under the Romans the town had the name of Carcacena. Not only were there significant Iberian and Roman settlements here, but this was also the see of one of the first bishoprics of early Christian Spain. Under the Moors it was a strategic stronghold and one of dozens of fortresses and watchtowers guarding the mountains. Taken after a bitter struggle in 1235, during the Reconquista, the town then acted as an outpost for Christian troops. Today Cazorla is heavily dependent on tourism and hosts events such as the Cazorla Blues Festival each July. There is also production of high-quality olive oil from the one third of municipal land planted in olive trees. Sierra de Cazorla is the Denomination of Origen for this olive oil. See Sierra de Cazorla. The town celebrates its annual fair in mid-September. For such a small town there are a surprising number of three and four star hotels and countless rural guest houses. Winter nights can be cold due to the elevation but snow is infrequent. Summers are cooler than the low-lying plains to the west and the town fills with tourists during the summer months.

According to the 2006 census (INE), the city has a population of 1629 inhabitants. Chilluevar is located on the north region of Alto Guadalquivir the northeast edge of which is part of the Cazorla, Segura, and Las Villas mountain range. Its territory is eminently agricultural and dependent on the olive grove. This crop occupies the sloping lands that go from the North and East to the rivers Vega and Ca√±amares in the south, southeast and southwest, where herbaceous crops are found. The closeness between the labour lands and the mountain chain has created an adequate habitat for cynegetic animals of minor haunting and for insectivorous birds, nevertheless haunting has made the population of these species minimal. The urban center is typical for its narrow and sloping streets. Besides the principal nucleus, where the majority of the population is concentrated. The hamlets of Los Almansas, Los Romos, and Chilluevar La Vieja also belong to this township.  History  The oldest finds in the region go back to the time of the Iberians, in the village of Almansas, and the Roman age, where it had an intense occupation by means of rural villages. From this age there has been preserved a set of funerary inscriptions in the Provincial Museum. Chillu√©var has been identified with Alconray, a place mentioned firstly at 1256, at Muslim age. It may be referred to the Alcorahe mentioned at 1384 in a document of King Juan I. The impulse and consolidation of the nucleus of Chilluevar started in 1231, the date when this land became part of the ‚ÄúAdelantamiento de Cazorla‚Äù patrimony of the Archdiocese of Toledo. Two circumstances contributed to the development of this village: on the one hand the flourishing of the constructions promoted by the Cardinal of Toledo, ‚ÄúDon Rodrigo Ximenez de Rada‚Äù, in his aim of promoting the christian faith on the land conquered to Muslims, and on the other hand, the transfer of cattle through that place, due to being an obligated path in the way from Andalucia to Levante for the ‚ÄúMesta‚Äù. In ‚ÄúChilluevar la Vieja‚Äù, as is commonly known the primitive emplacement, a hermitage, an inn, a cemetery and a swimming pool was constructed. Cattle ranchers, pilgrims and merchants used to visit the hermitage, found rest in the inn and made the cattle rest. The disappearance of the Mesta and the migration of cattle had, as a result, the progressive decay and marginalization of this emplacement, nevertheless, this decline was not homogeneous in all the region as at the end of the 17th century a new church was built in what is denominated as ‚ÄúChilluevar Nuevo‚Äù, about 1.2 kilometres from the earlier hermitage. In 1787 the village received the title of \\"town\\" granted by the Cardinal Lorenzana, this title endorsed its recognition as an urban nucleus. The first years of the 20th century were determined by a long process of segregation of Chillu√©var from the municipality of Iruela, which was finished on 14 December 1926, with the municipal independence of the Chuillu√©var.  Monuments  * Parish church of Our Lady of the Rosary * Roman road and Roman bridge on the Ca√±amares river. * Archaeological remains of the Roman site of Los Almansas.

In her honour, 24 January is celebrated as a festivity with a religious mass and a procession of her image. One of the things for which this festivity is known are the colossal luminaries that are raised all over the municipality the night before, created by the neighbours with the remains of the pruning of the olive tree; it is typical the bread with oil and roasted potatoes.  Festivity of San Isidro (15/05)  San Isidro and the Virgin of Peace are the patroners of Chilluevar: it is organised by the Fraternity of Labourers and it consists of making a festival working day, besides religious events in honour of the protectors of agriculture, not usually missing the delicious sausages for which Chuilluevar is known.  Fairs and Festivals in honor of Our Lady of Peace  In honour of the Lady of peace, this town of la Villas¬¥s chain, celebrates its fair from September 3 to 7, being Day 4 the Lady¬¥s celebration.

Plot The play is set in a fictional Liverpool nightclub called The Palace (it has been suggested that The Palace is in fact based on The Grafton Ballroom, a famous Liverpool nightclub which closed in 2008.) Each of the various characters in the play appears to have come to the Palace for a night of fun and to 'cop off' with someone of the opposite sex, but as the various plots unfold we discover that they are in fact all there for very different reasons. As each character pursues their quest the play moves up a gear bringing about a fast-paced second act in which comedy inter-weaves with some sad moments. Original Cast The original cast were: Paul Duckworth as Chris Gillian Hardie as Donna Gina Lamb as Elaine Linzi Matthews as Sue Mike Neary as Billy Liam Tobin as Gary/Barry Pete Price as Pete Price Other performances The play was staged again at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool from Friday 6 February to Saturday 7 March 2009 with the following cast: Helen Carter as Sue Warren Donnelly as Chris Gillian Hardie as Donna Mike Neary as Billy Alan Stocks as Gary/Barry Keddy Sutton as Elaine Pete Price as Pete Price The director was Bob Eaton and the producer Kevin Fearon. Reviews The Liverpool Daily Post review, July 2003:Review ‚Äì Slappers and Slapheads ‚Äì July 2003 'One of the best nights of home-grown comedy theatre to be enjoyed in a long time.' 'With a title like this you could be forgiven for expecting a night of crude humour and sexist jibes. Instead we were treated to one of the best nights of home-grown comedy theatre to be enjoyed in a long time. Filled with laughter, pathos and consistently excellent performances Slappers and Slapheads was a real triumph. Penned by Liverpool duo Len Pentin and Fred Lawless, the action was set in The Palace, a city club with more than a passing resemblance to the infamous Grafton in West Derby. Pete Price made an early appearance as the club DJ adding his own brand of humour to get the audience in the mood and add an extra layer of realism as he introduced some disco classics. The cast of Gillian Hardie, Gina Lamb, Linzi Matthews, Liam Tobin, Michael Neary and Paul Duckworth were outstanding throughout, skilfully combining raucous slapstick with moving drama. The first half was packed to the rafters with visual and verbal gags but, after the interval, the mood turned, as drunken nights out in clubs often do. Despite the more serious topics of birth and death, Pentin and Lawless managed to keep the laughter coming and more than one audience member alternatively wiped away tears of mirth and sadness. It was a little tricky to work out when the ending was coming as a series of short vignettes finished the play with each character resolving their problems before heading into the night. But when the finale finally came, many of the audience rose to their feet to deliver a well-deserved standing ovation. They may have been slappers and slapheads but they proved to be the perfect companions for another great night at the Liverpool Comedy Festival.' The Liverpool Daily Post review, February 2009:Review ‚Äì Slappers and Slapheads ‚Äì February 2009 'Some great lines, great actors and great tunes.' 'SLAPPERS and Slapheads began life at the Royal Court in 2003, and returns whipped into shape to launch the theatre's 2009 programme. And what a belter it is. Based on a night at the city's infamous Grafton nightclub ‚Äì which becomes the Palace, with off-stage DJ Pete Price warming up the audiences himself until the 18th ‚Äì there's more to it than you might imagine from the title. Everything is helped, of course, by some hugely enjoyable performances that really do justice to the notably tight writing of Fred Lawless and Len Pentin. And it's pleasing to say that it's the female roles that prove to be the most memorable. Gillian Hardie, as bolshie Elaine, leads the charge. In the wrong hands, the character could be some cloying tart-with-a-heart, but, as the saucy leader of the girls and no-nonsense judge of the boys, she shines. Helen Carter, who impressed last year with her supporting role in Once Upon a Time at the Adelphi, is understated this time as heavily pregnant Sue, desperately seeking the one night stand that resulted in her condition. And Gillian Hardie's straight-laced Elaine should not be able to get away with some of the filth she eventually finds herself turned on to, but produces a comic turn surely worthy of Royal Court legend. It's crude and lewd, but so very well written and enthusiastically performed that it works well. With some great lines, great actors and great tunes, this ‚ÄúScouse play‚Äù, perhaps more than any other definitely shows the potential to travel further afield.'

According to the 2010 census (INE), the city had a population of 6,208 inhabitants.  Etymology  It¬¥s name dates from the XI or XIII century arabic Walda(t) al-ma and meaning \\"water source\\". One possible origin for the name Huelma is from the Bereber Guelma as in the Argelian homonymous city of Guelma.  Nature  Huelma¬¥s municipality is located in the natural park of Parque natural de Sierra M√°gina, located around the Sierra M√°gina mountain range. There are hiking trails to the Pico M√°gina mountain and BTT tracks through the mountain. Geological sights like the Sierra M√°gina karsts and the Cabeza Montosa guyot or tablemount are given.  History  The Jandulilla river valley has been populated since ancient times with iberic remains found at the Cortijo del Pajarillo. Since the Pacto de Ja√©n signed between king Ferdinand III of Castile and the nasrid king Muhammad I of Granada the area from J√≥dar to Montej√≠car castle was a land of frontier between both kingdoms for almosto two centuries. Finally, in 1438 it was taken for the Castilians by √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 1st Marquis of Santillana. Later, in 1463 Henry IV of Castile gave the manor and ownership of Huelma to Diego Fern√°ndez de la Cueva, 1st Viscount of Huelma. Both the Castle of the Viscounts of Huelma and the Inmaculada Concepci√≥n Church, built by architect Andr√©s de Vandelvira, were built in the XVI century in Spanish Renaissance style. The Castle is in ruins since the XVII century but the Church stands as Vanderlviras finest work. During the XIX century the Spanish confiscation seizes and sales the former Order of Saint Augustine Convent that once stood beside the town hall. The works of the geographic Diccionario geogr√°fico-estad√≠stico-hist√≥rico de Espa√±a y sus posesiones de Ultramar describe Huelma during the XIX century and its XVII grid plan.  Main sights  Huelma has been recognized with five Bienes de Inter√©s Cultural (BIC) which are the XVI century Castle of Huelma or Castle of the Duke of Alburquerque, the notable renaissance church of Inmaculada Concepci√≥n built by Andr√©s de Vandelvira, the XV century Solera Castle in the village of Solera which was renovated in 2006, the Iberian archeological site of Cortijo El Pajarillo (the archaeological findings are located in the Iberian Museum of Ja√©n) and Huelma¬¥s historic centre.

According to the 2005 census (INE), the city has a population of 5,030 inhabitants. It is the biggest village in the region of El Condado. The river called Guadalimar runs for its municipal area. The patron saint of the village is Saint John Baptist whose festival is celebrated between the days 24 and 29 June. The patron Virgin is the Virgen de la Estrella whose pilgrimage is celebrated in her shrine the days 1, 2 and 3 May.  History   Origin  In the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the territory that now takes up Navas de San Juan had already human occupation, such as the settlements of Castell√≥n and La Atalaya. But it is not until the Iberian stage, probably due to a colonization promoted by the big Iberian center of C√°stulo, in about the 4th century BC, when the village was formed. In Roman times, the village became an important meeting point on the way between C√°stulo and Ilugo, as showed by the appearance of the two milestones in the municipal area. In the surrounds of Navas de San Juan, there was a mansion located, Ad Morum that was a stop in the Camino de An√≠bal. In its territory, there's a plentiful supply of agricultural villa-type exploitation, from which to the date seven have been recorded, for example, El Acero or El Cerro Prior.  Middle Ages  In times of Al √Åndalus, Navas de San Juan would be a little village (alquer√≠a) belonging to the administrative district the Sant Astiban. The Muslims built a castle, from which we only have some pictures, and subsequently, it was reformed by the Christians. In its district, there are remains of other fortified structures as the castle of Ero and the tower keep around which the actual shrine Santa Mar√≠a de la Estrella was built. The lands of Navas de San Juan were conquered by Ferdinand III of Castile in 1226 and integrated into the royal lands, under the jurisdiction of Santisteban del Puerto. In 1254 King Alfonso X donated Santisteban del Puerto to the city council of √öbeda. In 1285 King Sancho IV of Castile and Le√≥n turned Santisteban and its district again into royal lands. In the 14th century, Navas de San Juan and Castellar formed, by royal appointment, the lordship of Santisteban, delivered by Henry II of Castile to Men Rodr√≠guez Benavides. In 1473 Henry IV of Castile turned it into a county, granting Don Diego S√°nchez de Benavides the title of Count of Santisteban.  Modern Age  In 1793 Philip V of Spain raised the territory to a dukedom and granted it to the House of Medinaceli. The engagement with Santisteban del Puerto during the Modern Age ended in 1802 with the concession of the privilege of royal charter on behalf of Charles IV of Spain.  20th century  In the middle of the century, like in the rest of Andalusia, the village suffered the effects of mass migration from the countryside to the big cities, losing a 25% of its population between 1940 and 1975.  Monuments and places  At the beginning of the 20th century, the village was still crowned by a castle, but it was demolished and nothing from it survived. Some Roman remains of roads and settlements can still be found in the municipal district. Saint John Baptist Church was built between the 16th and 18th centuries, and it has a fa√ßade in the mannerist style and a 17th- century tower. The chapel of the Virgen de la Estrella also rose during the same period as the church of the village on a medieval fortification from which only the Tower Keep, declared of Tourist Interest, survives. The Town Hall is dated at the end of the 19th century, with a notable brick fa√ßade, a clock, and the bell tower with a belfry and a second-floor balcony. Also at the end of the 19th century, the Asilo de Santa Sara y San Fructuoso was built, in an eclectic style and of modernist decoration.  Folklore and customs   Local holidays  1, 2 and 3 May: Pilgrimage to the Virgen de la Estrella. Declared of Tourist Interest in 1984, it is carried out around the virgin's chapel situated on 5 km from the village. 23‚Äì29 June: Saint John's Day Celebration. One week of festivities held since 1808 in honour to the patron saint of the village, Saint John Baptist. First weekend of August: Emigrants Festival. Three days‚Äô celebration originally created to be enjoyed by those who live out of the village and could not attend the Saint John's Day Celebration. Because of this, everything about the patron saint's celebration is represented on a smaller scale.  Economy  The region's economy is mainly based on the olive tree. The small livestock activity in the village is focused on cattle. Another important resource is based on the itinerant fairs that provide many jobs during the summer.  Gastronomy  It is influenced by the cooking of La Mancha due to its geographic proximity, so that porridge or ratatouille are usual traditional dishes in the village. Yet, there are recipes typically made in the village, especially sweets and desserts as the pericones (originated in Arquillos) the pollas en leche or gachas dulces. It is also worth highlighting the calandrajos and the pipirrana as well as its sausages. Traces of old paths History Its historical precedents date back to the Bronze Age. As early as during the Roman occupation, it is known about the existence of an antique \\"mansio\\", hostelry, on the main road, which was a station of the Via Augusta ‚ÄìVia Herculea in the Carthaginian period- which linked Cadiz to Rome. This station was known as \\"Ad-morum de los Vasos Apolinares\\" (Ad-morum of the Vicarello Vases). It is supposed to have gained notoriety due to its proximity to C√°stulo and because it held an important part of the trade movement of the county. Others archaeological remains are those of the Roman city of Olvera (Olva), the Ca√±ada de √öbeda and those of the mines of the mountain range. The village of Navas de San Juan obtained the town charter awarded by the king Carlos IV, on 28 January 1802, then the lords of El Condado were Don Lu√≠s Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdova and Do√±a Mar√≠a del Milagro Benavides and Pacheco de la Cueva, as the history of the village is intimately linked with El Condado. The historical vicissitudes of the village have been diverse and have marked the development of everyday occurrences of the lives of Navas‚Äô men and women. The village The village sits on a nava (plateau) at 630 meters above the sea level. It is located 23 km from the Madrid-Cadiz railway, 35 km from the national highway IV and the same distance from C√≥rdoba‚ÄìValencia road, from Linares there are 32 km by the A-312 county road. In its municipal area, furrowed by the rivers Guarrizas, Guadal√©n and Guadalimar, the olive tree is cultivated in big extensions, as proved by the data of average crop of forty million kilos of olive, ground in five big local oil-mills, three of them cooperative and two private factories. In its vast rangelands, bull breeding has a privileged place, with six livestock in the municipal term, but sheep and goat farming may also be found. Big and small game hunting take up an important place in the local economy. The streets of the old town run in a winding way, taking as its point of origin the place before occupied by the Moorish castle. From this center and forming an urban structure in a radial way, the village was developed to Plaza de la Iglesia and Plaza de la Constituci√≥n (or Plaza de las Palmeras, as it is traditionally known). At present, these squares are the town's social centre. The town has examples of medieval and noble architecture, represented in buildings as Saint John Baptist's Parish Church. As provided in the book about the history of Navas de San Juan whose authors are the brothers Antonio and Miguel Nieto, the church had to be in the beginning the feudal castle of the Benavides family. This fact is reaffirmed by the architectural styles that dominate the current building, and the existence of underground passages communicated with the nowadays number 3 of the square, with the castle and with the well, located in the middle of current Calle Lorite. The huge difference existing in styles of the body of masonry, and in the walls that still survive of the Benavides‚Äô ancient palace, makes it likely that they were built on different dates. The first data that we have about the church date back to mid 16th century, whose date corresponds to the plateresque architectural style in the stalls. For this reason, there is no doubt that the body of masonry was probably a part of the same fortress or feudal castle belonging to the feudal lords of the town, since the reign of Henry IV. The works of the church were entrusted to the architect Nicol√°s de Torres. Celebrations In Navas de San Juan two local festivals are held: its patron saint's, Saint John Baptist, which is held from 23 to 29 June, and the Virgen de la Estrella's Pilgrimage, from 1 to 3 May. The patron saint's day celebrations have a pronounced taurine nature, given the love for bulls in the village. Encierros, corridas, and novilladas (enclosures and bullfighting) are carried out, and in the evening, the famous, crowded popular verbenas (night festivals) may be enjoyed. For naveros, the pilgrimage of Our Lady of La Estrella becomes a milestone every year. It is declared of National and Andalusian Tourist Interest. It is one of the most important pilgrimages in the province, where the pilgrims coming from all the Spanish territory enjoy venerating \\"La Reina Del Olivar\\" (The Queen of the Olive Grove) as the Virgen de la Estrella is known. During the evening of May third, the image is taken to the village in procession, where it stays until the first Saturday of September, when it is returned to its hermitage. The famous music of the \\"Mayos\\", of a great tradition and popularity, is intoned by the pilgrims. The Virgin's image does not show any mark of the sculptor nor of the year in which it was carved. Only, following its drawing lines, attitude, height and the obvious antiquity of the sculpture, it is possible to suppose that the image corresponds to the last period of Gothic art. The flat surface without a cloak in its dorsal part makes suppose that it was attached to any altarpiece in Antiquity. It has a carved cloak and with polychromy in blue with golden stars.

It was established by Royal Decree on 11 February 1885 and is awarded to commissioned officers in the Belgian Armed Forces for loyal and uninterrupted service or to Non-Belgian military officers for distinguished service in favor of the Military of Belgium. Award Criteria Belgian Military Officers The Military Cross, second class is awarded to Belgian military officers after 25 years of service. The Military Cross, first class is awarded to Belgian military officers after 25 years of service as a commissioned officer. In the Belgian military, years of actual service are sometimes multiplied with a certain factor when calculating the minimum due time for a long service award (to compensate for service in the air or on the battlefield). No such 'bonifications' may be applied when calculating the time served, required for the award of the Military Cross. Officers of the military reserve can also be awarded this decoration, on the condition that they are part of the trained (active) reserve forces and that their time served wasn't honored by the award of the Civic Decoration. When serious disciplinary actions were taken against an officer, resulting in a temporary relief of duty, each month (begun) of non- activity results in a penalization of 12 months when it comes to the calculation of the service time required for this award. For example 34 days of non-activity due to disciplinary actions results in a penalization of 2 years, meaning the officer will receive the second class of the Military Cross after 28 years of service, instead of the usual 25. This penalization is limited to 6 years per disciplinary action. This limit is reached whenever a temporary relief of duty of 7 months or more is ordered, which happens almost never. Non-Belgian Military Officers The Military Cross may be awarded to Commissioned Officers of non-Belgian armed forces for distinguished service towards the Belgian Defence. In such a case, the second class is awarded to officers below the rank of brigadier general. The first class is awarded to general officers. Appearance The Military Cross is a black enamelled Maltese cross with a 1 mm gilt edge, the cross arms end in eight 2 mm in diameter gilt spheres. Gilt crossed swords pointing up are positioned between the arms of the cross. The obverse central medallion bears the Belgian \\"lion rampant\\", pre 1952, the reverse medallion bore the royal cypher of the reigning monarch, post 1952, the reverse is identical to the obverse. Suspension is by means of a ribbon through a suspension ring passing through the orb of a pivot mounted crown. The green silk moir√© ribbon has two 5 mm wide red stripes set 1 mm from the ribbon's edges. The Military Cross First Class differs only from the second class award in the form of a rosette on the ribbon in the same colours as the ribbon. Devices When the first class of the medal is awarded, a rosette is attached to the ribbon. Notable recipients (partial list) As Belgian military officers receive the award as a long service awards, their names have been omitted from this list. * US Air Force Colonel Dean King - Military Cross Second Class *Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur - Military Cross First Class (1918) See also * List of Orders, Decorations and Medals of the Kingdom of Belgium References Other sources * Quinot H., 1950, Recueil illustr√© des d√©corations belges et congolaises, 4e Edition.

According to the 2011 census (INE), the city has a population of 8,924.  History  The town was first mentioned in the year 1396 owing to a petition made by Pedro Tenorio, archbishop of Toledo, to King Henry III of Castile. Hence the town's name, which means New Town of the Archbishop in Spanish. Before this date, the town was called La Moraleja, adjacent to Iznatoraf and towards the beginning of the 13th century formed part of the conquered territory of Cazorla. There exist basic forms of the ancient name of the locality, which before being called La Moraleja was called in Arabic Al- Buxarressa, from which La Moraleja derives. The urban nucleus of Villanueva del Arzobispo is situated next to the mountain of Albercones, to the west, at a crossroads. It presents a mixed picture, with some ancient districts made up of irregular roads and blocks of houses, and others with blocks more or less in a regular pattern which conforms to the more modern extended area. In the ancient quarter, situated in the west part of the centre, there are various roads with steep inclinations. The towns development basically radiated from the centre to the north-east and south-east, following the line marked by the highway 322 and by the way to the park. To the west the presence of the arroyo of the Pozo has prevented further urban expansion. King Philip II imposed criminal jurisdiction on the town in 1573. However, in the 20th century, the town was given the title of city by King Alfonso XIII in 1920.  Notable buildings  With a distinctive artistic history various buildings, places of great ecological importance and enclaves with a rich heritage include: * Iglesia parroquial de San Andr√©s (Parochial church of Saint Andrew), built on the ruins of a former mosque in the 16th century. * Santuario de la Virgen de la Fuensanta (Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Holy Springs) which receives the patronage of the Four Towns (Villanueva del Arzobispo itself, along with Iznatoraf, Villacarrillo and Sorihuela del Guadalimar). * Iglesia de la Vera Cruz (Church of the True Cross), in which is a statue of Jesus by the sculptor Mariano Benlliure. * Convento de Santa Ana (Convent of Saint Anne), a baroque construction with a Renaissance cloister of the 16th century. * Plaza de Toros (Bullring), designed by architect Mr Angel Arbex and built in 1928 in neo- Moorish style. * Casa de los Arcos (House of the Arches), early 20th century building with Moorish-style interior. * Ermitas del Calvario (Hermitage of Calvary), founded by Saint John of the Cross in 1576.  Economy  Agriculture is dominated by the olive. Currently, four grades are used in the work in making the olives into olive oil. The quality of the waters of the Sierra de Cazorla is considered sufficient for the installation of a mineral water bottling industry. Other important industries include San Miguel Arc√°ngel and the biomass plant La Loma (generation of energy from olive skins and other olive products). The cultivation of cereals is very small, and is substituted by the olive.

It comprises the first and second episodes of the show's first series, aired on BBC1, broadcast in two parts on 24 September and 1 October 2007, with the second being broadcast a week earlier on the CBBC Channel. This serial is notable for introducing Clyde Langer into the cast - he would remain for the rest of the series. Plot Part 1 Maria and Luke start their new school, but find all is not as it seems. Aided by Sarah Jane and their new friend Clyde Langer, they find the Slitheen, who are enemies of The Doctor, disguised as teachers who have taken control of the technology block and are trying to switch off the Sun. Luke unknowingly gives the Slitheen the code to start the machine, and they start to absorb the power of the Sun. Sarah Jane investigates the company controlling the science block, and Maria, Luke and Clyde investigate the school. Sarah Jane is attacked by a Slitheen who disguised herself as a company secretary, Janine. Luke finds a secret room and is confronted by the Slitheen commander, his headmaster Blakeman, whilst Maria is hiding under a computer desk after being spotted by Jeffrey. Jeffrey removes his human disguise in front of Maria, but the only thing visible to her are his green feet. Maria runs away, and meets up with Clyde, who runs away too. They are rescued by the school genius Carl who then reveals he is, too, a Slitheen. Part 2 They all manage to escape and head back to Sarah Jane's house. Clyde figures out that the Slitheen are negatively affected by acetic acid, and the team head off back to the school with squirty bottles of vinegar. After Maria uses the vinegar to blow up the Slitheen commander, Blakeman. Then they head over to the secret room where Luke tricks the Slitheen by telling them the machine won't take the power of the Sun. He turns the machine off and uses the sonic lipstick to cause the machine to malfunction. As the room explodes, the continental Slitheen, still disguised, escape whilst Janine is electrocuted and explodes and Jeffery and Carl are trapped. They beg for Sarah's help, and she tries to open the door, but Jeffery is killed when the technology explodes. However, at the same time, Carl escapes using a teleport. Sarah Jane is highly affected by this, as she is unaware of the teleport and thinks Carl is dead with his father. Afterwards, she tells Clyde about her travels with The Doctor, and then accepts him into the team. Continuity The Slitheen previously appeared in the Doctor Who episodes \\"Aliens of London\\", \\"World War Three\\" and \\"Boom Town\\" and in the interactive episode \\"Attack of the Graske\\". Upon realising who she's dealing with, Sarah Jane quotes Rose Tyler's remarks on \\"Slitheen in Downing Street\\" from the episode \\"School Reunion\\". The Headteacher says 'For the Love of Clom', referring to Raxacoricofallapitorius's twin Planet first mentioned in Love and Monsters. He also mentions the Blathereen, another family from their planet who would later be seen in The Sarah Jane Adventures. They look the same as the Slitheen but are orange in colour. Cast notes The American Newsreader played by Lachele Carl previously appeared in the Doctor Who episodes \\"Aliens of London\\", \\"World War Three\\", \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" and \\"The Sound of Drums\\". Novelisation This was the second of eleven Sarah Jane Adventures serials to be adapted as a novel. Written by Rupert Laight, the book was first published in paperback on 1 November 2007.

Koch attended the Hungarian Royal Drawing School. As a student, he worked during the summers in printmaking plants and won several prizes for poster designs. The Hungarian National Bank invited him to participate in a competition for new treasury notes. He graduated from the academy in 1922. During 1921‚Äì1923, Koch worked for CHNOIN, the largest pharmaceutical-chemical factory in Hungary, the Hungarian Institute of Fighting Plant Disease and the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture designing posters and packages with drawings of plant cross sections, insects and bacteria. Also, during this time Koch worked as an Industrial Artist providing illustrations of machines, aerial views and products. In 1923 Koch was invited to go to Estonia by Hungarian professor Csekey to illustrate his book on Estonia and Finland. He stayed in Estonia from 1926 to 1940, where he made many drawings of well known places. He worked for companies such as Kivi√µli Shale Oil Refinery (Eesti Kivi√µli) and Lorup Glass Factory. His drawings, woodcuts and etchings were used as publicity material, Christmas cards and pamphlets. The Hansa publishing house commissioned Koch to illustrate books. While in Estonia he also worked in close connection with architects rendering perspective drawings. In 1928, Koch met, and one year later, married Elsa Holzinger. On many occasions Koch made trips to Finland on assignments to draw horses for the Army and the Finnish Horse Breeders Association. His works have been exhibited in several museums in Estonia. In 1937, the Republic of Estonia and the Kingdom of Hungary signed an agreement regarding intellectual co-operation between the countries. In September 1938 the \\"Hungarian Art Exhibition in Tallinn\\" opened, and was attended by Estonian President Konstantin P√§ts as well as various diplomats and ministers. Ern≈ë Koch displayed paintings at this show, and personally described his works to President P√§ts. Koch returned to Budapest in 1941 during the Soviet invasion of Estonia. In Budapest, he was commissioned by the Budapest Municipal Government to execute a series of cityscape etchings. In addition, he received numerous commissions from factories, especially the paper and steel mills. He worked in Budapest until 1944 when the Soviet Army invaded Hungary. Koch fled to Germany with his two young daughters, Ilma and Edith. As a refugee, he and his daughters stayed in a displaced persons camp for several years. Ern≈ë Koch immigrated to the United States in 1950 and lived in Florida until 1952. In 1952 he married Estonian J. K. in New York and moved to Chicago where he worked for Karl Hackert Inc., a firm that designed stained glass windows, altars and mosaics for churches. He was commissioned by a Boston architectural firm to design a mosaic ceiling depicting twenty Polish saints for the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.. In 1958 he moved his family to St. Louis, where he became the principal designer in the studio of the Jacoby Art Class Company, until his retirement in 1964. During his spare time and after retirement, he continued as a freelance artist and exhibited his paintings, etchings and woodcuts. In his last few years, he specialized in welded sculpture at his studio in Brentwood, Missouri and was affiliated with the Sculptors Gallery. Works by Koch can be found in churches, museums and private collections throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. By 1959, Koch had established himself as a prominent local artist in St. Louis. Some examples of his stained glass windows can be found at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington D.C.; Basilica y Parroquia La Purisima Concepcion, Monterrey, Mexico; Chapel of the Alexian Brothers Hospital, St. Louis; Chancery Office of the Archdiocese of St. Louis; and St. Augustine Episcopal Church, Wilmette, Illinois. Some examples of his sculptures can be found at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis; Boone County National Bank, Columbia, Missouri; Commercial Bank & Trust Co., Muskogee, Oklahoma and St. Louis Electric Company, St. Louis, Missouri. I knew and worked for Ern≈ë in his Brentwood studio from 1966‚Äì1969, when I was a student at Concordia Seminary, Saint Louis, Missouri. Ern≈ë always spoke about going to art school in or nearby Sopron, Hungary. From 1966 through 1969 he produced several large welded pieces, often using birds as a thematic device. [Ern≈ë's welded pieces were exhibited and handled by the Sculptor's Gallery on Locust in Saint Louis.] It was during the same period that he printed a group of multi-block, multi-colored old and new testament themed woodcuts from plates which he had cut in 1961-1962. Prior to 1966 he had only printed proofs of the woodcuts. Ern≈ë would pick us up from the seminary on Saturday mornings about 6am; stop at the donut store for \\"starch\\" (usually a dozen donuts) and head for the Brentwood studio where we'd spend the day printing the woodcuts which were eventually exhibited at the seminary library. Following Erno's death, his unfinished commissions were completed by Jim Nickel, a sculptor currently living and working in NYC who is exhibited by the Atrium Gallery, Saint Louis. Jim took over Ern≈ë's Brentwood studio space before permanently moving to NYC. We all loved Ern≈ë; Jim understood his work best.

Noyes and his followers moved to the site in Oneida from Putney, Vermont in 1848. The Community lived in the Mansion House communally until 1880, when they dissolved into a joint-stock company. The Mansion House has been continually occupied as a residence since its construction in 1862. In the 20th century the Mansion House became a National Historic Landmark. It is currently overseen by a non-profit organization chartered in 1987 by New York State Board of Regents. It also includes residential apartments as well as guest rooms for overnight lodging.  History  The Oneida Community Mansion House is located a 33-acre remnant of the original Community site, which in the 1860s included more than 160 acres of land surrounding Oneida Creek in Madison County, New York and Oneida County, New York. This land was made available for purchase by Euro-American settlers after its acquisition by the State of New York in a series of agreements with the Oneida Indian Nation in 1840 and 1842. The initial farmstead of the Oneida Community was purchased by Jonathan Burt, an early convert to the religious doctrine known as \\"perfectionism.\\" In 1847, Burt invited John Humphrey Noyes and his associates in Putney, Vermont to come to Oneida and combine in a Perfectionist association. John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community Burt wrote to John Humphrey Noyes, extending the offer to establish a community in Oneida. At the time, Noyes and his followers were living in Putney, Vermont in a group known as the Putney Association. The group lived communally, as one family sharing property and work, in a system they called \\"Bible communism.\\" However, their practice of complex marriage (a form of polyamory) was controversial. After Noyes was charged with committing adultery in Vermont, the group moved to Oneida in March 1848, becoming the Oneida Community. First Mansion House Following the designs of carpenter and self-trained architect Erastus Hamilton, with the collective guidance of the community and its founder Noyes, the first Mansion House was erected in the winter of 1848. The structure provided a larger space for the Oneida family after it quickly outgrew the small farm houses built by Burt and others, and two log cabins left behind by the Oneida Indians. The majority of this first work was done by the Community, which had a saw mill on-site and carpenters in the membership. A Community member recalled that \\"the building of a home was the first enterprise that enlisted the whole Community; and it was one in which all were equally interested. All labored; the women no less than the men.\\" One of the Mansion House's most prominent features was the tent room, located on the third story. The 35 by 30 foot space consisted of twelve tents that conveniently denied members of isolation and encouraged social interactions. Another important area of social gathering was at the common table that all members were required to eat at during meal times. Not long after its construction, the first Mansion House became overcrowded and its members acknowledged the pressing need for more space. In its October 25, 1855 issue, the community newspaper, The Circular, appreciated that the \\"smallness of space has served as a compress on excessive individuality, and brought element of Communism;\\" However, the Community's population had reached one hundred and seventy members, and they had outgrown the space. New Mansion House In 1861 the Community began construction of a larger, brick dwelling, under the guidance of Community member and architect Erastus Hamilton. The 1862 Brick Mansion House is 45 by 60 feet and three stories high. A south wing was added in 1869 and another addition, design by Lewis W. Leeds was added in 1877-78 to accommodate the growing community, which then numbered close to 300 people. The architecture of the Mansion House, and the process of designing the home, reflected the communal values prized by the Oneida Community. The ideas for the 1862 house were discussed in evening meetings, with the group eventually settling on a plan for an Italianate Villa-style structure. The first floor housed an office, reception room for visitors, library, and guest bedroom. Individual sleeping rooms were arrayed around communal siting rooms on the first, second and third floors. A five-story Italianate tower was located at the northeast corner of the House, overlooking the site and designed with its own access stair and entry Communal space was important to the Community, and thus the most prominent interior feature of the 1862 House is a two-story Family Hall with a capacity for several hundred persons and which served as the daily gathering place of the whole Community. Smaller sitting rooms were important and daily social spaces for reading, work activities, and cross-generational socialization. The second floor sitting room is described in Community publications, such as The Circular, as one of the \\"coziest places in all of the house\\". The second floor sitting room included a third floor gallery that overlooked the sitting area. Since the members eschewed private ownership of property, individual processions were simple and sleeping rooms were almost monastic. Additionally, sleeping room assignments were rotated periodically to preempt member attachment to a specific room. The sleeping rooms still provided some privacy in a communal environment and corresponded to the Community's practice of complex marriage. Big Hall The Big Hall at the Mansion House The Big, or Family, Hall was designed to be the center of community life. The two-story hall was painted in trompe l'oeil style, with Windsor-styled spindle back benches on the main level, and fixed bench seating for an additional 200 on the balcony level. A raked stage at the east end of the hall was designed for the performing arts. At eight o'clock every evening, members gathered in the Big Hall to receive instruction from Noyes, listen to readings, deliberate on practices within and by the community, and participate in the social bonding practice that they called 'mutual criticism.' South Wing The 1869 South Wing, constructed in Second Empire Style, was added to the Mansion when the Community inaugurated an intentional plan for members to have children. For many years, the Community practiced birth control and kept the birthrate purposefully low. By the late 1860s, Noyes and other Community members developed an interest in selective breeding. They asserted that religious devotion was inheritable, and that they could pass on their own strong sense of spirituality to successive generations by careful breeding. They called their eugenics experiment ‚Äústirpiculture.‚Äù The children born in the experiment were known as ‚Äústirpicults.‚Äù The South Wing of the Oneida Community Mansion House Generally, children stayed with their mothers for nine months before moving to the South Wing, where they received daily care from the elder heads of the 'Children's Department' and teachers. Within the South Wing, children were separated by ages. The youngest were together in the Drawing Room, the oldest in the South Room, and children in between were in the East Room. Children had many toys‚Äîblocks, marble rollers, rocking houses, and homemade picture books, and received lessons in a variety of subjects. Although it was hoped that the children would be highly spiritual, it turned out that ‚Äúthe children were much like other children of the same age,‚Äù as one stiripicult later recalled. ‚ÄúThe women who cared for us spent much of their time settling differences of opinion over who should have a certain toy.‚Äù  Post-Community  Facing criticism from outside the Community and growing internal dissension, the Utopian group voted to disband and became a joint-stock company known as Oneida Community, Ltd. in 1880. Their manufacturing enterprises included canned fruit, animal traps, sewing silk, and tableware. Known later as Oneida Limited, the company became a top producer of silverware in the twentieth century. After the Community voted to disband, ex-members and their descendants continued to live in the Mansion House. They turned small, individual rooms into suites to accommodate a less communal lifestyle. A few of the single local public school teachers, teaching in the VVS School District, were allowed to live in the Mansard roof section of the Mansion. These young teachers paid a very low rent and were served four dinners a week, Monday through Thursday, during the school year. The teachers were each given a bedroom and shared bathrooms with other teachers, although one teacher, Mr Al Simmons, lived in one of small apartments located in another part of the Mansion. He was a long‚Äìtime business teacher at Vernon-Verona-Sherrill Central High School. That was unusual as these apartments were reserved for Community family members. The non-profit Oneida Community Mansion House acquired the property from Oneida Ltd in 1987.

It serves the Huntsville, Alabama, area with a country music format. Its studios are located in Madison, Alabama and its transmitter is located north of Huntsville. WDRM has been consistently ranked by Arbitron as the most-listened to radio station in the Huntsville market for two decades. The weekday morning show, currently hosted by Dan McClain and Josie Lane, was top-rated in the Huntsville market for two decades until falling to #2 in the Summer 2008 ratings. Syndicated programming includes After Midnite with Blair Garner hosted by Blair Garner from Premiere Radio Networks. Except for a short period from 1982 to 1986 when it was officially \\"WDRM-FM\\" to accommodate a co-owned AM station being branded as \\"WDRM\\", this station has been assigned the WDRM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission since it was initially licensed. WDRM simulcasts the audio of Huntsville-based television station WHNT when severe weather threatens its listening area. History WHOS-FM started in 1951 on 92.5 FM as a simulcast of WHOS-AM (800 kHz), but aired 24 hours a day, unlike WHOS, which could only air in the daytime. The station was later moved to 102.1 MHz in 1959. WDRM was automated without live disc jockeys until the late 1960s. In 1967, WDRM began a popular evening program called \\"Nite Country\\" which featured a live DJ and phone in requests. The first DJ on Nite Country was Tony Beason (1967‚Äì69). He was replaced in 1969 by Wayne Forsythe (1969-71). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station, now known as WDRM, played a Top 40 and Album rock format; the station employed a youthful stable of on-air personalities during this era. Barry \\"The Nightcrawler\\" Cole, Doug \\"More Music\\" Micheals, and Thom Collins were a few of the disc jockeys on the station during that period. Comedic comments and an on-air attitude of \\"not following the rules\\" was very popular with younger listeners, most of whom had never heard hard rock on the radio before. The nearest stations to Decatur that played a hard rock format were in Birmingham, and they were very difficult to receive except on external FM antennas. Unfortunately, this type of broadcasting was not conducive to selling advertising in a predominantly religious and conservative part of the country (and with relatively few affluent teenagers and young adults) like northern Alabama, and the station suffered financially as a result. This was because few businesses wanted anything to do with what some of them considered \\"sinful\\" programming. For a brief time in the early 1980s, WDRM made a first attempt at a country format, with little success due to the numerous AM outlets serving the Tennessee Valley at the time with that type of music, some of whom had played country for decades (one of those was WDRM's AM sister station, WHOS). After that failure, WDRM decided to return to pop and rock in 1982, adopting what was then known as an \\"urban contemporary\\" sound. The station used the branding \\"Jam 102\\" and played a mix of Top 40, album rock, and urban. Major Logan was the program director at this time creating the format and name. The station was beginning to attract attention and turn around after a long period of being unprofitable for the owner. On-air personalities during this period included Major Logan, Bill \\"BS In the Morning\\" Simon, Gary \\"Madman\\" Mattox, David Player \\"The Suntan Superman\\" and \\"Sir Charles\\". The main sales market at that time was limited to Decatur and had not branched out to the Huntsville area. Unfortunately, Decatur was not ready for that format, which proved more controversial than even the late 1970s rock era; much of that probably had to do with the station's obvious attempts to attract a biracial audience, something still distasteful to many local whites. As such, the jockeys got continuous anonymous threats and local \\"bad press\\". After much discussion of the station's community relations problem, consideration of the rising popularity of mainstream country music among younger listeners, and falling ratings against market leader WZYP, station management decided to try a country format again in 1984, this time with an emphasis on current hits and a polished presentation. Collins and most of the other staff members were fired, a new program director was hired, and the station became successful, especially in the early 1990s when country listenership reached new heights all across the U.S. and it began selling advertising in the Huntsville area. From 1986-1996, WDRM had high ratings with the Bob and Elaine Morning Show, which would boast the highest ratings of any station in the country, gaining a 32 share of the audience in the ratings in 1992.

It preserves a bed of ancient stromatolites in a Cambrian rock layer, which were the first to be recognized and understood for what they are. The site was a private park open to the public for many years, but is now closed. The site was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1967, and a National Historic Landmark in 1999. Description and history The Petrified Sea Gardens site is located at 42 Petrified Sea Gardens Road, about north of N.Y. 29, in far western Saratoga Springs, New York. The site is about in size, although the outcrops of interest occupy only about of the largely wooded site. The outcrops are a part of a larger geological formation known as the Hoyt Limestone, which is also exposed in Lester Park, a public park operated by the New York State Museum about north of this site. Although stromatolites can be found more widely, they are rarely exposed in this area because of later glacial action. The structures now identified as stromatolites, which are marine algae growths, were first identified on this site in 1825, but what they were was unknown and the subject of scientific debate. James Hall (1811‚Äì1898), the first State Paleontologist of New York, identified them as being organic and placed stromatolites in a new genus. Pioneering female paleontologist Winifred Goldring (1888‚Äì1971), was the first to identify the creatures responsible for creating the structures found, and described those found here among the finest surviving specimens. Samples from this site were later compared to stromatolites of more recent construction found in Australia. In 1924, Robert F. Ritchie, a stonemason and amateur geologist who owned the property, opened a park to show them to the public. and The site was a childhood inspiration for Stephen Jay Gould who went on to become \\"one of the most famous paleontologists of the twentieth century\\". The site was most recently open as an educational site operated by a non-profit, the Friends of Petrified Sea Gardens until 2006. It is currently closed to the public.

In the past, the village also administered two nearby settlements Hraniƒçky and ƒåerven√Ω D≈Øl and today is a part of the village Uheln√°. Establishment The village lies about 10 km south-west from the town Javorn√≠k (Jauernig in German) and was founded in the 13th century along a small mountain stream in the heart of Rychlebsk√© Hory. Together with another local village Travn√° (Krautenwalde in German ), Nov√© Vil√©movice belong among the oldest settlements in the region. Initially, it was owned by the members of the Haugwitz family, but in the 15th century was sold to the Principality of Neisse Grottkau, which was under the rule of the prince-bishops of Breslau. During this period most people moved out of Nov√© Vil√©movice and by 1460 the village was empty. In 1580, under bishop Martin von Gerstmann of Breslau the settlement was again repopulated, but the number of citizens never reached its former size. By 1767 a small chapel was built in the village, this was in 1832 elevated to a rectory, and in 1768 also a school house. Majority of the 800 or so citizens worked in agriculture related fields, manufacturing and as forest workers. Recent history As most towns and villages in the region, Nov√© Vil√©movice was a purely German settlement. Consequently, after 1945, under the Bene≈° decrees, all its citizens were forced to leave Czechoslovakia. By 1947 the village was nearly empty and was never properly resettled under the repopulation programs of the Czechoslovakian government. The village suffered from neglect and the condition of the standing structures deteriorated. In 1976 the local church burned down and was torn down in the early 1980s. Today, only few houses in Nov√© Vil√©movice still stand and serve mainly as weekend holiday homes.

The movement was the subject of considerable international as well as domestic debate in the 1970s and 1980s. Authors saw that much of the history and tradition of the island was being ignored or suppressed in government-sponsored education. In their work they sought to carry forward this distinct Taiwanese cultural identity that existed apart from the colonizing efforts of China and Japan. Just as their predecessors in the 1920s had incurred official sanction from the Imperial Japanese government then ruling the island, authors in this new movement worked against the bans imposed by the authoritarian Kuomintang regime and were targeted for criticism by the Communist government in China. The movement is closely associated with the emergence of Taiwan's democracy in the 1990s. Figures associated with the Taiwanese literature movement include: Tseng Kuei-hai (ÊõæË≤¥Êµ∑) *Lin Yang-min *Wu Ying-tao (Âê≥ÁÄõÊø§) *Lin Chi-yang (ÊûóÊ∑áÁÄÅ; pen name: Xiang Yang ÂêëÈôΩ) *Tyzen Hsiao (composer) *Li Kuei-hsien Authors sought to gain acceptance for the Taiwanese Hokkien language along with other languages encountered on the island (aboriginal languages and Hakka). These, the mother tongues of the majority of the island's natives, became in their hands the vehicles for serious literature, including essays, plays, and epic poetry. They made the island itself the center of their perspective on history and looked to local traditions and lore as fuel for creative ideas. An example may be seen in the 1994 poem \\"If You Would Ask\\" by Lee Min-yung. The poem adopts the point of view of a Taiwan aborigine speaking to all the island's newer residents. If you ask Who is the father of the island of Taiwan I will tell you The sky is the father of the island of Taiwan If you ask Who is the mother of the island of Taiwan I will tell you The ocean is the mother of the island of Taiwan If you ask What is the past of the island of Taiwan I will tell you Blood and tears drop on the feet of the history of Taiwan If you ask What is the present of the island of Taiwan I will tell you Corruption in power is eroding the Taiwanese soul If you ask What is the future of the island of Taiwan I will tell you Step out on your feet, the road is open to you. (Translation: Joyce Hwang) Native sources and unacknowledged island history were not the only influences. Authors drew inspiration from a number of literary figures abroad: Poland's Zbigniew Herbert and Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz; Czech poets Jaroslav Seifert, and Miroslav Holub; Russia's Joseph Brodsky; France's Andr√© Gide and Paul Val√©ry; Turkey's Nazim Hikmet, Japan's Tamura Ryuichi. The Taiwanese literature movement inspired a flowering of books, songs, and theater pieces using Taiwanese, Hakka and Taiwan aboriginal forms of expression that continues today. Taiwan's universities today offer recognize the languages and works championed by the movement as major fields of study.

Lever came through the youth ranks at Grimsby Town in 1988. He became a first team regular in the early nineties and was part of the team that won promotion via the Football League Division Two play-off final and the Football League Trophy during the 1997‚Äì98 season. Lever spent the first twelve years of his career with Grimsby and departed the club in 2000 when he joined Bristol City. Injuries prevented him from making a real impact at Ashton Gate and after two years he moved on again to Mansfield Town. In 2003, he dropped out of professional football and joined Non-league Ilkeston Town before finishing his career in 2004 whilst on loan with Ossett Albion. In 2008, he was appointed to the coaching staff of Bridlington Town, briefly making the step up to manager in 2009. Career Grimsby Town Lever came through the youth ranks at Grimsby Town and was promoted to the club's first team squad by Alan Buckley at the beginning of the 1987‚Äì1988 season. He naturally soon became one of the club's regular centre backs, and found himself slotting in at the side of veteran centre half Paul Futcher. Lever received the club's \\"Supporters Young Player of The Season\\" awards in both 1989 and 1991. He went on to be an integral part of the Town side that earned two back to back promotions in 1990 and 1991. When Futcher moved on, Grimsby nurtured in Peter Handyside as his long-term replacement, and both players were part of an iconic Mariners defensive line up in the nineties that included the likes of Gary Croft, Graham Rodger, John McDermott and Tony Gallimore. Arguably Lever's most successful season was the 1997‚Äì1998 campaign, in which Grimsby bounced back from relegation the previous season, to clinch promotion back to the First Division via a 1‚Äì0 victory over Northampton Town at Wembley Stadium in the Second Division play-off final. Also before the final victory, Grimsby, aided by Lever defeated AFC Bournemouth at Wembley in the Football League Trophy final with a 2‚Äì1 scoreline. Lever continued to play for The Mariners in the 1998‚Äì1999, and 1999‚Äì2000 campaigns, and was also used as a makeshift captain in the absence of Paul Groves on several occasions. Lever's contract expired with The Mariners in the summer of 2000, and he opted to leave Blundell Park. In his time at Grimsby, he made over 400 appearances in all competitions, scoring a total of 8 goals, he made his final appearance against Birmingham City in the final league game of the season, a few weeks after this match, Lever received the \\"Supporters Player of The Season\\" for the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign. Lever is considered to this day to be a cult hero by Grimsby Town supporters, and is one of the most successful players in the club's history. Bristol City After 12 years at Grimsby, Lever dropped down a division and signed for Bristol City in July 2000 on a free transfer, and naturally became the main candidate to be the club captain. However his first season, was ruined by injury, after making his debut on the opening day of the season in a 2‚Äì0 defeat against Wrexham, Lever went on to feature in two more games, before injury ruled him out for the rest of the 2000‚Äì2001 campaign. The following season was more successful for Lever, as he completed 34 games in all competitions, coupled with a single goal in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Oldham Athletic on 2 February 2002. At the end of the 2001‚Äì2002 campaign, City decided not to renew Lever's two-year contract and he was released. Mansfield Town In August 2002, Lever signed for newly promoted Second Division side Mansfield Town. He made his debut for The Stags in the 2‚Äì0 derby defeat against local rivals Chesterfield on 28 August 2002. Lever would only go on to make 15 league appearances for Town in the 2002‚Äì2003 season, while also playing in the 3‚Äì0 FA Cup defeat against Crewe Alexandra on 7 December. Lever was released by the club at the end of the season, thus bringing to end his career playing in the professional leagues. The FA Cup defeat with Crewe, turned out to be his final game for the club, and in professional football. Ilkeston Town Lever signed a one-year deal with Northern Premier League outfit Ilkeston Town at the start of the 2003‚Äì2004 season. This would be his first taste of the Non League football circuit, and he notably formed a defensive partnership with former Nottingham Forest stalwart Steve Chettle. Lever signed a one-year contract extension for the 2004‚Äì2005 season, and during this season he had fallen out of favour within the Ilkeston playing squads, thus opening up a loan move too lowly Yorkshire amateur side Ossett Albion. He remained with Albion for two months before returning too Ilkeston. Lever was released by Town in May 2005, and subsequently retired from playing competitive football aged 35. Style of play Lever, was described as \\"A big, old-fashioned centre-half that bullies strikers.\\" Coaching career In 2009 Lever briefly managed Bridlington Town.

He was the grandson of Los Angeles pioneer business and real estate magnate, Harris Newmark, the author of My Sixty Years in Southern California 1853‚Äì1913. Harris Newmark had emigrated from L√∂bau (also spelled Loebau), Prussia. Father (Leopold Loeb) Eugene Meyer, a cousin of Josephs's father, Leopold Loeb, joined with Constant Meyer and Nathan Cahn to purchase the S. Lazard & Co. business from Solomon Lazard in 1874, and thence operated as Eugene Meyer & Co.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55729210/dissolution-of-solomon-lazard- co/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55731071/eugene-meyer-added-as-a-partner- to/ In January 1879, Leopold Loeb was added as a partner to Eugene Meyer & Co.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55731071/eugene-meyer-added-as-a-partner- to/ In October 1883 the Meyers sold out, Eugene Meyer moved to San Francisco, Emmanuel L. Stern was admitted, and the three partners formed Stern, Cahn & Loeb.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55730324/dissolution-of-eugene-meyer- nathan/ At this time Stern, Cahn & Loeb started promoting the store as \\"The City of Paris,\\" Meyer had also been the French Consular Agent in Los Angeles, and he recommended Leopold Loeb to take as consul, which he did in 1883. Leopold Loeb served as the French Consular Agent for over fifteen years. Brother (Edwin Loeb) Joseph's younger brother Edwin J. Loeb graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1904. Both brothers earned law degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. Joseph was the editor of The Daily Californian and Phi Beta Kappa. Legal Practice After Joseph's graduation he law clerked with the Henry O‚ÄôMelveny law firm. In 1906, he was admitted to the bar in Los Angeles and retained his association with the O‚ÄôMelveny firm until 1907. At that time, he joined Edward G. Kuster in the practice of law; and, in 1908, they, along with Edwin, formed the law firm of Kuster, Loeb & Loeb. Edwin and Joseph Loeb read proof for their grandfather, Harris Newmark, at the time of the publication of his book on Southern California. About 1911, Edward Kuster left the law office, and the firm of Loeb & Loeb was established. Over the years, the firm has operated under various names: Lowenthal, Loeb & Walker; Loeb, Walker & Loeb, to the current name, Loeb & Loeb, in 1938. Joseph's contribution to the firm was the handling of corporate business accounts. (Edwin took care of their movie studio clients.) In particular, the firm become notable for representing their cousin Kaspare Cohn's enterprises: Kaspare Cohn Hospital (later Cedars of Lebanon, and now known as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) and Kaspare Cohn Bank (now Union Bank of California), where he was a director. The Loeb & Loeb firm went from a two-man practice in its beginnings to a large international law firm. Political and Charitable Activities In 1943, Joseph Loeb was appointed by Governor Earl Warren to serve as a member of the California State Board of Education, in which capacity he served until 1956. From 1947 until 1972, he was a member of the Board of Fellows of Claremont Colleges.

It is made up of three neighbourhoods (barrios): Alto, Bajo and Fern√°n N√∫√±ez (locally called La Loma). It is situated on the European route N¬∫ 4 (Spain to Crete).  History  There is evidence of habitation in the area from the late Palaeolithic era. It is impossible to say exactly when the village originated. However, as the Greeks introduced better cultivation of both vine and olive to Spain, together with methods of irrigation and Abu√±uelas derived from the Latin ' vinolea ' meaning an area of vines, it suggests their cultivation before the time of the Romans 220 BCE until 409 CE. Here they found small, scattered pueblos built of adobe and whitewashed. They gave the province the name Betis where they had vines and grains cultivated, which together with minerals, were exported back to Rome. There are still openings of mineworkings around the village. Evidence of Moorish occupation can be seen in the Torre del Tio Bayo, an tower constructed in the latter Nazar√≠ period, about the middle of the fourteenth century. In the 12th and 13th centuries advances in hydraulic technology were applied to agriculture and the Roman latifundia were superseded by the Arab minifundia system. It is an area of frequent seismic activity. During the Andalusian earthquake of 25 December 1884 the village suffered considerable damage, in part due to landslides caused by the topography and soil composition. More than 70% of the houses collapsed, and the rest suffered serious or minor damage. There was most damage in the upper neighborhood. There were 102 dead and up to 500 injured.  Economy  Timber, almonds and olives form the main economic activity, on the Sierras de Albu√±uelas, which rise to 1426m at Herrero. Albu√±uelenses may occasionally be seen farming the surrounding terraces using mules but more often with modern machinery. Recent climate change has replaced the main crop of cereals with citrus and semi tropical fruit.  Natural History  Two main water courses are located in this municipality, Albu√±uelas stream and Barranco de Luna. Both originate in the Sierra de Albu√±uelas and excavate the eastern border of the Albu√±uelas plateau.

In the 2005 census, INE reported its population as 5107 inhabitants. The town is on the edge of the Sierra de Hu√©tor Natural Park and is in a region of intensive olive production. The town is above sea level, but the local fossil record contains marine molluscs that show the profound geological forces that have shaped the region. The area has been occupied by humans since prehistory. A very important neolithic site - la Barranca de Las Majolicas - is within the town, and human remains, decorated ceramics, and bone tools and ornaments have been found there. Between 711 and 1492, most of Spain was governed by a series of Muslim dynasties and monarchs. We do not fully understand the origins of the name Alfacar, but in this era the Arabic name \\"al-Fajjar\\" (¬¥the house of the potter¬¥) was first applied to the settlement. The town was a summer retreat for the Muslim Zirite kings (1010-1090). There are few visible architectural relics from this time. The Arabs adapted the Fuente Grande to channel its waters to Granada, and the old heart of the town retains the structure of an Arab settlement. The Christian Reconquest of Spain culminated on 2 January 1492 when Boabdil, the last Muslim king of Granada, surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. Thirteen days before, the Muslim population of Alfacar capitulated to the advancing forces. History shows that the Arab inhabitants of Alfacar continued living in relative peace under the new regime and did not participate in the subsequent unsuccessful uprising of the \\"Moriscos\\". However, this did not prevent their expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula in 1579 during the reign of Philip II, after which Alfacar was repopulated by Castillian Spanish families. An important building that dates from this period is the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady (La Iglesia de la Asunci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora), built on the site of a former church that was destroyed in 1557 and in turn was situated over the foundations of a former mosque. The town is most famous for the death of poet and dramatist, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, born 1898 in nearby () Fuente Vaqueros. On 19 August 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist forces detained him; he was subsequently shot during the early morning at a location between Alfacar and the neighbouring village of V√≠znar. The circumstances of his assassination and the location of his grave remain a controversy. The town of Alfacar has grown considerably from its ancient centre. It has recently suffered from the economic crisis and many construction projects remain unfinished, while various businesses have been forced to close. There is evidence of regeneration with new shops and restaurants opening, and Alfacar is renowned throughout the region for its famous bakeries which probably date back to Arab times and provide many shops in Granada with fresh daily bread. Alfacar is well provided with shops, a medical centre, theatre, sports centre and many other facilities. However, what remains of the historic centre of the town is under serious threat from neglect and redevelopment. An example is the 15th-16th century Arco de Somera, an ancient store room situated above an arched alleyway, which is urgently in need of stabilization. The countryside around Alfacar abounds with wildlife including Iberian ibex, wild cat and wild boar, and in spring one can find many species of orchids, bulbs and other wild flowers. The adjacent protected region of Sierra de Hu√©tor has an excellent visitors centre and is a popular destination for walkers. There are extensive regenerated pine forests, large areas of native evergreen oaks and the rare Spanish conifer, Abies pinsapo, has been reintroduced here. Alfacar is also famous for the blue butterfly Lysandra bellargus ssp. alfacariensis, that was first identified in the area.

History It was formed by the union in 1971 of Mecina Bombar√≥n and Yegen, and is situated in the central-northern area of La Alpujarra (Granada), 108 km from the provincial capital, in the south-east of Spain. It is bounded by the municipalities of Lanteira, V√°lor, Ug√≠jar, C√°diar and B√©rchules. Its council was formed from the centres of Mecina Bombar√≥n, Yegen and Golco, together with the cortijada (hamlet/farmstead) of Montenegro, Spain. The municipality lies on the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the houses look out towards the mediterranean sea in the distance. Its terraced farmlands are watered by the melting snow from above, giving rise to a high-altitude oasis of greenery above the arid foothills below. Alpujarra de La Sierra is one of over 50 villages in the area, which were the last stronghold of the Spanish Muslims, or Moors. Soon after the Castilians took Granada in 1492, all the region's Moors were forced to convert to Christianity. Those who refused took to the hills, settling in this remote, inaccessible area. Alpujarra de la Sierra retains its traditional Berber architecture and has many quaint white houses with flat clay roofs lining narrow streets. Alpujarra de la Sierra is probably most famous for one of its past residents - the author, Gerald Brenan who wrote \\"South From Granada\\", which recounts the adventures of an Englishman who after serving in World War I, walked through Andalucia in search of a cheap place to live and write, and discovered the tiny village of Yegen. He rebuilt a ruined house (now marked with a plaque in his memory) and was visited by many of his friends of the famous Bloomsbury group.

C√°diar has historically been a place of confluence of different cultures which swept across Las Alpujarras. It was called \\"Albacete\\", because of its location on a level place.

After the reconquest of Granada in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs, the population was under intolerable pressure, and in 1568 a wealthy landowner in the area called Fernando de C√≥rdoba y Valor (Aben Humeya) took up arms against King Philip II. The revolt began in C√°diar on Christmas Eve when a detachment of soldiers billeted in C√°diar were quietly murdered in their beds.

As Congressman of Lanao del Sur, he is best remembered for calling for the impeachment of Ferdinand Marcos 1968 because of the President's role in the Jabidah Massacre, in which government troops massaccred Tausug 68 Military trainees. When the congress could not muster enough support for the impeachment, Lucman grew convinced that Muslim Mindanao needed to become independent, and founded the Bangsamoro Liberation Organization (BMLO), which later joined forces with the Moro National Liberation Front. After Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law, Lucman went into self-exile in Saudi Arabia in 1976 and worked closely with opposition Senator Ninoy Aquino to push proposals of Autonomy for the Moro people. Lucman's health began to fail soon after he learned of the assassination of Ninoy Aquino, and he died less than a year later in Riyadh in 1984 - two years before the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao under Aquino's widow President Corazon Aquino. His son, Haroun Alrashid Alonto Lucman Jr., was eventually elected as Vice Governor of Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2013, and re-elected in 2016, holding the position up till the 2019 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region creation plebiscite, which proposes the abolition of the ARMM in favor of a new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.  World War II  Upon the outbreak of World War II in the Philippines, Lucman fought alongside the US Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). After the surrender of US forces in the Philippines, Lucman organized the first guerrilla force in Mindanao, engaging in numerous battles against the Japanese Imperial forces.  Political career  Because of his war record, Lucman was appointed deputy governor for Lanao del Sur in 1944, serving until 1949 when he left to work as correspondent for the Manila Chronicle. He returned to politics in 1953, then served as regional development officer of the Convention on National Integration at Marawi City from 1959 to 1961. In 1961 he was elected congressman of Lanao del Sur in 1961, serving until 1969.  The Jabidah massacre and Lucman's calls to impeach Ferdinand Marcos Lucman was serving in congress on 18 March 1968, when the Jabidah massacre took place. The Marcos administration had gathered a group of Tausug recruits for an operation called \\"Project Merdeka\\" (merdeka being the Malay \\"freedom\\"). The military began training them on the island of Corregidor to form a secret commando unit called \\"Jabidah,\\" which would destabilize and take over Sabah. The trainees eventually rejected their mission, for reasons that are still debated by historians today. Whatever the reasons behind their objections, all but one of the recruits were killed. The survivor, Jibin Arula, escaped with a gunshot to his leg and was able to tell his story to the press. When opposition senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. came out with an expos√© alleging that Marcos was ultimately culpable for Jabidah, Lucman called for Congress to begin proceedings to impeach President Marcos. When his proposal didn't get enough congressional support, he became convinced that Muslims should rule themselves in Muslim Mindanao - a conviction he continued to hold after the end of his term as congressman in 1969.  After Congress  In 1971, he joined Senator Mamintal Tamano, Congressman Ali Dimaporo, Congressman Salipada Pendatun, University of the Philippines College of Arts and Sciences Dean Cesar Adib Majul, Delegate Ahmad Alonto, Commissioner Datu Mama Sinsuat, and Mayor Aminkadra Abubakar to form the Islamic Directorate of the Philippines. The Libyan government of Muammar Gaddafi donated funds to the Directorate to purchase land in Tandang Sora, Quezon City for the construction of a mosque.  Martial Law and self-exile  In 1972, with the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos, Lucman fled to the Middle East.  Ninoy Aquino and Moro Autonomy discussions  In exile, Lucman developed a working relationship with Benigno Aquino, Jr., whom the opposition had looked to as a potential replacement after Ferdinand Marcos, who was very sick at the time, stepped down from the presidency. Aquino began discussiong plans for Moro Autonomy with Lucman, as an alternative to full Moro independence. In 1983, it was Lucman who helped Aquino circumventing an order from Malaca√±ang Palace forbidding Aquino the issuance of a passport so Aquino could come home to the Philippines from exile in Boston. Lucman obtained a passport for Aquino with the alias \\"Marci√°l Bonifacio\\" (taken from martial law and Fort Bonifacio, where Aquino was once detained).  Death  The shock Aquino's assassination took its toll on Lucman's health, and he died the following year in Riyadh. It was 1994 - two years before the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao under Aquino's widow President Corazon Aquino.

According to the 2006 census (INE), the city has a population of 2073 inhabitants. In the north east corner of the Granada Province and at around 130 kilometres from Granada City (home of the Alhambra), Cuevas del Campo is one of the six picturesque villages that make up the area of Baza in the Altiplano region. It covers 97 km2 and has a population of approximately 2,500. It lies in between the Sierra de Baza and the Sierra de Cazorla. Cuevas del Campo is the youngest of the municipalities in the Baza region, having been formed in 1980. The population is approximately 2,500 and the inhabitants are known as ‚Äôcueve√±os‚Äô. The village economy is basically agricultural, with a strong emphasis on olives. History Over many years there have been disputes between the towns of Pozo Alc√≥n (Ja√©n Province) and Z√∫jar (Granada Province) regarding the boundaries of these two municipalities. The result of a long legal wrangle ended up with the dividing of the territory into three parts, one of which was El Retamar (which is now Cuevas del Campo). Over 30 years the people of Cuevas del Campo wanted segregation from Z√∫jar (which is situated some 20 kilometres away). This was finally granted on 21 November 1980, when Cuevas del Campo finally became an independently constituted municipality. Climate As with the other villages in the Altiplano area the summers are long and dry, with cooler evenings than many other parts of Andalusia. The winters can bring cold fresh days and sometimes snow, but often coupled with bright sunshine. Fiestas Semana Santa (Easter Holy Week) is a special time in most of Andalusia. It is particularly interesting in Cuevas del Campo because since the year 2001, they have had the special added attraction of ‚ÄòSemana Santa Viviente‚Äô where professionals and other villagers act out various parts of the Passion of Christ, including crucifixion and resurrection. On the 15h and 16 May there is a festival in honour of San Isidro. The Town Hall organises various events. Floats are decked out and the people wear traditional dress and a communal picnic takes place, all in honour of the Saint. In August (15th and 16th) there is the August fair. There are many local events, including a canoe race, which was first introduced in 1997 and has been a great success ever since. At the beginning of October is the Fiesta of the Santo Angel. Many years ago there was a terrible plague of locusts and it is said that the Saint was taken out, with the people in procession behind and walked through the village. Apparently this drove away the locusts and so each year this fiesta is celebrated in thanks. Handcrafts In times gone by, objects hand-woven from dried grasses, for household use were used in every home. Rush matting and other objects were necessary for every day living. Nowadays, it is the older people who still have the skills to hand weave such items. Baskets, mats, fans, bottle carriers, etc. were all simply essential utensils for everyday life, while now they are also sold as decorative items or souvenirs to visitors. There was also local pottery and tile production at one time, which has disappeared with modern times. However, hand-made embroidery and also crochet work is experiencing somewhat of a revival. Gastronomy Home-cooked meats such as pork, lamb, chicken and rabbit are the base of many of the local dishes, which normally include delicious, locally grown vegetables, pulses and cereals. The recipes are a mix of Arabic and Spanish styles as a result of past influences in the area and most dishes are fairly hearty since this is a hard working agricultural people who live through cold winters. Locally produced prepared, cold meats are a must to try, as well as \\"patatas a lo pobre\\" (‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs potatoes‚Äô) ‚Äì potatoes cooked in olive oil, with onions and green peppers - served with many main dishes.

He was a member of the faction of the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement known as Team Anna which supported Anna Hazare's campaign for the implementation of the Jan Lokpal Bill. After a split in IAC, he helped Team Anna form the Aam Aadmi Party. In 2015, he made several allegations against the party's leadership, its functioning and its deviation from the core ideology, values and commitments. He is one of the founders of Swaraj Abhiyan and Sambhaavnaa, an Institute of Public Policy and Politics. Early life Prashant Bhushan is the oldest of the four children of Shanti Bhushan and Kumud Bhushan. His father is a lawyer-activist and a former Union Law Minister in the Morarji Desai government. Bhushan, who briefly attended IIT Madras and Princeton University has a degree in law from Allahabad University. While still a student, Bhushan wrote The Case that Shook India, a book on the case that set aside Indira Gandhi's election in 1974.  Legal activism  Bhushan was drawn to public activism, influenced by his father. His main areas of interest have been human rights, environmental protection and accountability of the public servants. He is associated with various organisations including the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), and Transparency International (India). He is also the convenor of the Working Committee of the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reforms. Bhushan states that he has taken up about 500 cases dealing with \\"good causes\\". His family background allowed him to work on a pro-bono basis for such cases: according to him, he effectively spends only 25 per cent of his time on paid cases, charging 5 per cent of what other lawyers charge. He has criticised the other professional lawyers as \\"amoral\\", and claims that he never takes up a case unless he feels that his client is \\"morally right\\".  Judicial accountability  Bhushan says that he envisages a transparent and honest legal system, where people can negotiate their own cases without the need of any lawyers. In 1990, he and his father formed the Committee on Judicial Accountability (CJA) to fight corruption in the judiciary. The organisation comprised some lawyers and ex-judges. Prashant Bhushan started focusing more on this issue in 1993, after the Supreme Court Justice V. Ramaswami was not impeached by parliament on corruption charges. In 2007, the Bhushans expanded CJA to include citizens and form the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform (CJAR). In 2009, Prashant Bhushan represented activist Subhash Chandra Agrawal, asking for the Supreme Court and High Court judges to be brought under RTI. The judges were forced to declare their assets and post it on the court websites. In a 2009 interview, Bhushan alleged that at least half of the 16 former Chief Justices in the Supreme Court were corrupt. Harish Salve filed a contempt case against him in 2010, and the Supreme Court asked Bhushan to apologise. In response, Bhushan submitted an explanation stating why he felt those judges were corrupt. The Bhushans noted the difficulty of getting documentary evidence because judges are immune from investigation. Krishna Iyer, a former Supreme Court judge, said that either the Bhushans should be punished for making \\"false charges\\" or an independent authority should be set up to scrutinise their allegations. Bhushan has recommended amendment to the Contempt of Court Act clause, stating that some of its clauses effectively prevent the press from exposing the corruption in the judiciary. He has also opposed the rule which prevents people from registering a First Information Report against a judge without the permission of the Chief Justice of India.  Government accountability  In 1990, Bhushan wrote a book Bofors, the selling of a nation (1990) on the Bofors scandal. CPIL won a major victory in 2003 when the Supreme Court restrained the Union government from privatising Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum without the approval of Parliament. As counsel for the CPIL, Rajinder Sachar and Bhushan argued that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalised in the 1970s. Bhushan represented the CPIL in a petition asking for the removal of Neera Yadav from office as Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh for alleged corruption. Yadav had been named in five CBI corruption cases and 23 departmental proceedings. In October 2005 the Supreme Court directed the Mulayam Singh state government to remove her from her position. The case became the first in which an Indian Administrative Service officer in Uttar Pradesh was convicted of corruption. In February 2006, as counsel for Lok Sevak Sangh, Bhushan submitted to the Supreme Court that the MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) might not be constitutionally valid. A TV channel had recently aired video of a sting in which it appeared that some MPs had taken bribes under the scheme. Bhushan said none of the normal controls were being applied, and the scheme was breeding corruption. The same year, Bhushan also represented the CPIL in a petition alleging that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola were failing to warn the public of harmful ingredients in their beverages, and were luring young children through misleading advertising. Bhushan filed a PIL challenging the appointment of P.J. Thomas as Central Vigilance Commissioner, after Thomas had been charged in the Palmolein Oil Import Scam. In March 2011, SC struck down the appointment. Prashant Bhushan acted for the CPIL when it took the lead in filing a suit against the Government of India for irregularities in a major award of spectrum for 2G mobile telephones. The CPIL petition alleged that the government had lost $15.53 billion by issuing spectrum in 2008 based on 2001 prices, and by not following a competitive bidding process. The Supreme Court asked the CBI to probe the irregularities in the auction of 2G spectrum. The inquiry resulted in the resignation of the telecom minister A. Raja, who was later arrested along with others including the DMK MP Kanimozhi, officials of Unitech wireless and officials of Reliance ADAG. In September 2011 Bhushan presented evidence that appeared to disprove the claim by the CBI that Dayanidhi Maran, the former telecom minister, had not applied undue pressure to the owner of Aircel to sell to the Maxis group of Malaysia. Bhushan said the CBI's investigation had been \\"less than honest\\". In January 2012 Bhushan questioned why the CBI had failed to lay charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act against companies such as Essar Group and Loop Mobile despite strong evidence against them. In February 2012 the Supreme Court declared the allocation of spectrum had been illegal. In 2012, Bhushan filed a PIL seeking cancelation of coal block allocations by the government on the grounds that certain companies had been illegally favoured by the politicians. In response to the PIL, the Supreme Court (SC) scrutinised coal block allocation since 1993. Bhushan also filed a PIL against illegal iron ore extraction in Goa, which led to the Supreme Court halting all the mining operations in the state. He successfully challenged the Prime Minister and Home Minister's decision to appoint PJ Thomas as the head of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Acting on his PIL, SC directed the CVC to apprise it of actions taken on complaints by whistleblowers in the country. Prashant Bhushan also represents whisteblower Anand Rai in the ongoing PIL regarding Vyapam scam in the Supreme Court. Before K V Chowdary's appointment Prashant Bhushan raised a red flag, asking the Prime Minister not to go ahead with his appointment, raising severe objections on Chowdary's tenure as CBDT Chief. After Chowdary being appointed, NGO Common Cause represented by Prashant Bhushan has filed a petition in Supreme Court of India challenging K V Chowdary's appointment as CVC and T M Bhasin's appointment as VC on 22 July.  Naxalism  Prashant Bhushan has criticised the use of violence against the Naxal insurgents in the tribal-dominated areas. He has alleged that the actual intention of the Operation Green Hunt was to clear the tribal lands for mining operations and industrialisation. According to him, the rapid industrialization has led to \\"destructive development\\" in the tribal areas through pollution and displacement of people. After the April 2010 Maoist attack in Dantewada, which led to the death of 76 policemen, he stated that such \\"retaliation\\" was expected because the government had declared the anti- Naxal operations as a war. He stated that to de-escalate the situation, the government should suspend the armed operations against the Naxals, and instead focus on providing food and infrastructure to the tribals. In April 2012 Bhushan drew criticism from Congress leaders when he refused to act as a mediator in negotiating with Maoists who were holding a District Collector hostage. He appealed to the Maoists to release the Govt. officer without conditions. He also said that the government should investigate and address legitimate demands.  Death penalty  Bhushan is against death penalty, and spoke against the hanging of Ajmal Kasab, who was the lone captured terrorist in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Along with Nitya Ramakrishnan, he was the counsel for the Banned documentary December 13, which is a reconstruction of the events that led to the attacks on Parliament, based on the chargesheet filed by the special police cell.  Other issues  In 1990, he successfully got the criminal liability aspect in the Bhopal gas tragedy reopened by SC, by challenging the settlement in the case of compensation to the victims. This reopened the case against the former Chairman of Union Carbide Corporation Warren Anderson (now deceased). Bhushan assisted the Narmada Bachao Andolan activists opposed to the Sardar Sarovar Dam. After six years of hearings, in October 2000 the Supreme court ruled to allow the massive project to recommence. Bhushan criticised the decision for having been made \\"without any evidence of the facts [being presented] before the judges\\". In February 2001 a criminal petition was filed with the Supreme Court of India accusing Medha Patkar, Prashant Bhushan and Arundhati Roy of contempt of court for having demonstrated in front of the Supreme court in protest against the judgement on the Sardar Sarovar dam. Bhushan defended Arundhati Roy when she was charged with contempt of court for publicly criticising judges in the dam hearings. In March 2002 she was sentenced to one day in jail. According to Bhushan the judges were \\"just affronted by the fact that somebody has dared to criticise them\\". Bhushan is opposed to the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. He is opposed to nuclear energy, and supported the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy against establishment of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. In August 2015, Bhushan filed a PIL in the Supreme Court against the alleged corruption and nepotism in the selection of lower court judges in the Delhi Judicial Services Examination conducted in October 2014. As a result of the PIL, the Supreme Court ordered that the papers be checked by P. V. Reddi, a former SC judge and former Law Commission Chairman Justice. He subsequently recommended that 12 more judges should be inducted into the services. The Supreme Court has to issue guidelines for long-term systemic reform such as increasing transparency in the recruitment procedures. The Attorney General of India and the Government of India initiated contempt proceedings against advocate Bhushan for his tweets on February 1, 2019 in relation to the hearings before the Supreme Court of India in the case involving appointment of CBI chief. Later, however, the Attorney General sought to withdraw the proceedings, indicating that the comments had been a \\"genuine mistake\\" by Bhushan. In August 2020, the Supreme Court of India held that Bhushan was guilty of contempt of court, in relation to two posts made by him on Twitter. The first post was a criticism of the role played by the previous four Chief Justices of India, and the second criticised the Chief Justice of India in relation to a photograph of him posing on a motorcycle without a mask while the Court was in lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic in India. Justice Arun Mishra, writing for the bench, held that these tweets were not just personal opinions, and that they tended to \\"shake the public confidence in the institution of judiciary\\". The proceedings were criticised widely by multiple former judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, including Supreme Court Justices Kurian Joseph, Ruma Pal, G.S. Singhvi, A.K. Ganguly, Gopala Gowda, Aftab Alam, Jasti Chelameswar and Vikramjit Sen. Bhushan was also supported with statements published by senior advocates and civil servants. During the proceedings, the Attorney General of India had objected to the Supreme Court, noting that contempt proceedings required his consent, which had not been obtained in this case. The Supreme Court declined to hear him and initially published an order that did not record his appearance, although it was later amended to correct this error. On 31st August 2020, the Supreme Court fined him 1 for contempt of court, which he paid the same day.  Team Anna and Jan Lokpal movement  In 2010, there were a series of anti-corruption demonstrations in India, after high-profile cases like Commonwealth Games scam and Adarsh scam were highlighted in the media. An anti-corruption crusade which included a demand for a Jan Lokpal Bill took place and became known as the India Against Corruption movement. Prashant Bhushan was one of the several activists who participated in the anti-corruption crusade. In March, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) invited Hazare, the most prominent leader of the movement, for talks. Prashant Bhushan and his father Shanti Bhushan, along with Swami Agnivesh and Kiran Bedi, accompanied Hazare to the meeting. Subsequently, in April 2011, Hazare nominated the Bhushans as members of the joint committee constituted to draft a final version of the Lokpal Bill. A few days after the committee began work, a CD was released that appeared to be a recording of conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party. The recording, related to 2G spectrum case, would discredit Shanti Bhushan, if found to be genuine. Prashant Bhushan stated that labs had shown the CD was doctored, and that its purpose was to obstruct the anti- corruption movement. Later, Singh claimed that Bhushan telephoned him and tried to stop him from talking, a charge which Bhushan denied. The committee met the government representatives several times to discuss the proposed bill. Prashant Bhushan stated that the Lokpal should have full autonomy and power to prosecute all public servants, and that this principle was non-negotiable. Team Anna activists disagreed with the government's attempt to keep the Prime Minister out of the Lokpal's purview. The government did not want the Lokpal to have the power to investigate the Prime Minister, the higher judiciary, the defence services, the CBI and the CVC and the conduct of MPs inside Parliament. The government's draft of the bill also excluded several other Lokpal powers proposed by Team Anna's draft such as the powers to tap phones. On 4 August 2011, the government's version of the Lokpal bill was tabled in the Lok Sabha. Prashant Bhushan and other IAC activists criticised the bill as weak, stating that it would provide protection to the corrupt officials. Hazare staged a demonstration against the government's version of the bill, but was detained. The other activists, including Prashant Bhushan, then organised peaceful protests across the country. Following a hunger strike by Hazare and more failed negotiations with the government representatives, a section of Team Anna activists led by Kejriwal and Bhushan decided to enter politics to pass the bill themselves.  Himachal land controversy  In 2011, the Congress leader Digvijaya Singh alleged that the two Bhushans had failed to pay taxes due when they bought an investment property in Allahabad. Bhushan denied the charge, calling it a \\"very organised and concerted attempt to smear members of the civil society in the Lokpal drafting committee with allegations\\". In a similar accusation, the former BJP Chief Minister, Prem Kumar Dhumal, had rejected those charges, defending the grant of relaxations to the educational trust.  Kashmir issue controversy  In 2011, at a press conference in Varanasi, Bhushan stated that he wanted the Armed Forces Special Powers Act to be revoked in Jammu and Kashmir. He added that the government should try to persuade the people of the Kashmir valley to align with India but that they should be allowed to separate if they wish to do so. On 12 October 2011, he was attacked by the members of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena inside the Supreme Court complex, for these remarks. The group accused him of trying to break up India. He was dragged out of his chair, and repeatedly kicked and punched. Bhushan described his attackers as having a \\"fascist mindset\\" and stood by his statements. Several politicians and activists condemend the attack on Bhushan, while some others criticised him. The Shiv Sena called for a police case to be registered against Bhushan, accusing him of supporting the anti-national elements. Hazare distanced Team Anna from Bhushan's remarks, saying that these were his personal views.  Aam Aadmi Party  Bhushan had long been a critic of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. In 2012, he co-founded the Aam Aadmi Party, stating that the other political parties were corrupt. Bhushan accused BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of being corrupt and a \\"puppet\\" of Reliance Industries. He also accused RSS of supporting terror activities, and criticised BJP for its links with the RSS. Before the 2015 Delhi elections, Bhushan accused party's chief Arvind Kejriwal of selecting candidates of his own choice.Prashant Bhushan accuses Kejriwal of selecting candidates with money and muscle power to win? After the elections, on 4 March 2015, Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were voted out of Political Affairs Committee of Aam Aadmi Party for alleged anti-party activities and for working toward the party's defeat in the Delhi elections. Both Bhushan and Yadav denied the charges. On 28 March 2015, they were dropped from the National Executive Council of the AAP following a vote, at a meeting the conduct of which was afterwards disputed by Bhushan. He and Yadav then formed a new political movement called Swaraj Abhiyan.Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan sacked from AAP national executive In April 2015, they were expelled from the party by AAP's disciplinary committee.AAP expels Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan  Personal life  Prashant Bhushan is married to Deepa Bhushan, a former lawyer.

Later, during the Islamic domination of Spain, it became a farming country.

The original idea was raised by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before moving back to the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010. History The Queen Elizabeth Walk was the proposed site for the national memorial. In the background is the Fullerton Hotel (building in white), where the memorial stone was initially erected in 1970. The original idea of erecting a keynote memorial at the Singapore waterfront as a dedication to Singapore's early founders was mooted in 1969 by the Alumni International Singapore (AIS), a body set up to represent Singaporean graduates from 11 countries who had gathered locally for Singapore's 150th anniversary.Brazil, \\"A Sadly Unfinished Monument ‚Äì Early Founders Memorial Stone,\\" 9‚Äì10. AIS announced that a proposed memorial on Queen Elizabeth Walk by the Padang would require some S$250,000 (US$163,000) to be raised. An open design competition was held and sculptors were asked to come up with a design to celebrate the Singaporean for \\"his courage, his adventurous and enterprising spirit and his indomitable will, not only to survive but to make good.\\" Foundation stone On 18 January 1970, President Yusof bin Ishak laid the memorial's foundation stone along Collyer Quay Street, on what was supposed to be a temporary site. Before an audience of some 500 people, including members of the diplomatic corps, President Yusof gave a speech: The foundation stone consists of a rectangular granite stone topping off a pyramid-shaped brick pedestal with inscriptions in the four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil): Competition The Civilian War Memorial in the War Memorial Park at Beach Road was referred as resembling \\"four chopsticks\\". In July 1973, designs for the memorial had been received from 38 sculptors but the top two prizes were not awarded; it was found that no entry was deemed worthy of the honour by the AIS panel of judges earlier. Instead, five sculptors received merit awards from AIS, together with a token S$250.Brazil, \\"Controversy erupts\\", p. 10. One of the merit awards recipients, Ng Eng Teng, who was to receive Singapore's Cultural Medallion in 1981 and who now has his critically acclaimed works all over Singapore, commented unhappily: \\"We have never been so embarrassed or insulted in all our professional lives. No professional artist of our standing would condescend to receive such an amount. We felt we had been taken for a ride.\\" In response, AIS expressed regret that the aggrieved sculptors had publicly stated their dissatisfaction. The alumni further rejected a complaint that the results were 10 months overdue, and repeated that no suitable entry had been received. Subsequently, three of the five sculptors banded together to produce a design they described as \\"four pieces of cuboid leaning towards each other and pivoted on four corners\\" which was referred by AIS as resembling \\"four chopsticks\\". Ironically, this was the nickname and roughly the design concept of the Civilian War Memorial, which was adopted in another separate open competition in 1966. In September 1975, the alumni announced in public again that the Early Founders Project was at \\"a very advanced stage and will be launched as soon as Government approval has been obtained. The site of the monument has already been earmarked on the reclaimed land off the Esplanade.\\" Despite the announcement, the ambitious project became inactive and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and not nearly enough of the S$250,000 funds had been raised. In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships. Roles switched The Memorial Stone at the premises of the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise, Singapore As a result, the memorial stone became the memorial itself. The monument was later moved by the authorities to make way for the gentrification of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.Schoppert, \\"More Trouble Than It Is Worth ‚Äì What can we expect from public art in Singapore?\\" On 9 July 2010, the foundation stone was moved back to the corner of Fullerton Building where it now sits overlooking the Singapore River following a ceremony and speech by The Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts.http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/html/etc/10_FoundationStone.htm  See also  *Fort Canning Lighthouse *Long Ya Men References  Notes   Bibliography   * Category:Monuments and memorials in Singapore Category:Museum Planning Area ","title":"Early Founders Memorial Stone"},{"id":"13123174","text":"D√∫dar is a municipality located in the province of Granada, Spain.

It borders the municipalities of D√≠lar, Lanjaron, Nig√ºelas, Villamena, and the Padul. Other nearby towns are Padul and Mond√∫jar. The council consists of durque√±o nuclei D√∫rcal, which is the capital district Lecr√≠n Valley, and Marchena. Much of its township is located in the Sierra Nevada National Park.  History  Evidence of inhabitants have been found from 4500 BC by way of archaeological finds from the Neolithic age - utensils, vessels, polishing stones and the like. Later findings along the R√≠o D√∫rcal indicated the area as a natural passageway between the Mediterranean coast, La Alpujarra and the Granada area. Among the early settlers were those from the Middle East in search of raw metals, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. It is the presence of the Roman civilization here that has yielded the majority of artifacts which are housed in several museums in the surrounding area. Between the Roman and Arab eras, not much is known about the area. But from the 8th to 15th centuries during the Moorish reign, the area became a bustling agricultural center protected by forts and walled areas that oversaw the valley's passageways. The villages therein were dedicated to the growth of citrus fruits and mulberry trees which were necessary for silk production. It is from this time that the village names evolved, such as D√∫rcal meaning Durkar in Arabic but whose significance is unknown. Also during this era were built numerous buildings of architectural importance. In 1491, during the start of the reconquest of the area by the Catholic Monarchs, all that had been built in the Lecr√≠n Valley was completely destroyed. By 1492, Granada had been conquered and the Moorish era came slowly to an end. After the expulsion of the Moors that ended in 1571, D√∫rcal's economic life came to a halt with the cessation of their agricultural and crafts and its population dwindled to a mere 320 inhabitants in 1587 and 160 in 1730. During the 19th and 20th centuries the population again grew albeit slowly, and the agricultural trade was revived. Over the last generation, D√∫rcal has grown in diversified ways, developing economies in industrial and service areas, as well as more recently attracting rural tourism. A new future is being written for this town with a long history of upheavals. The singer and actress Roc√≠o D√∫rcal drew the name of this town at random from a map of Spain, which she would subsequently use as her stage name. She was therefore declared an adoptive daughter of D√∫rcal and the city council named a street in her honor and erected a statue of her in the main square, Plaza Espa√±a.

Since 1949, the company has published many books on all the arts, particularly subjects such as opera and painting, the theatre and critical and philosophical theory. Calder's authors have achieved nineteen Nobel Literature Prizes and three for Peace.  History  John Calder started his publishing house in 1949 when manuscripts were plentiful and many books that were in demand were out of print ‚Äì in the immediate post-war years paper was scarce and severely rationed. During the 1950s he built up a list of translated classics, which included the works of Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Goethe and Zola among others. Calder then began to publish American titles. As a result of Senator Joe McCarthy's \\"witch-hunt\\" he was able to acquire significant American authors as well as books on issues of civil liberty that mainstream publishers in New York City were afraid to keep on their lists. This led to the development of close ties with those smaller American firms who resisted the McCarthyite pressure. By the late 1950s, Calder was publishing a group of new writers who would change the face of twentieth-century literature. One of these was Samuel Beckett, all of whose novels, poetry, criticism, and some of his plays were published by Calder.\\"Nobel Prize to Samuel Beckett\\", The Guardian, 13 November 1969, p. 8. Several writers on the Calder list became synonymous with the school of the \\"nouveau roman\\" or \\"new novel\\", including Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, Nathalie Sarraute and Robert Pinget.Sayers, Stuart (11 February 1984), \\"Not a man for allowing remainders\\", The Age, p. 169. Other European novelists, playwrights and poets included Heinrich B√∂ll, Dino Buzzati, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Fernando Arrabal, Ren√© de Obaldia, Peter Weiss and Ivo Andric. Calder was soon launching new experimental British writers such as Ann Quin, Alan Burns, Eva Tucker and R. C. Kennedy ‚Äì who, influenced by their European counterparts, became part of the avant-garde of the early 1960s. From his experience of authors' tours, John Calder saw that readers much enjoyed hearing authors air their ideas in public ‚Äì often in heated debate. He persuaded the Edinburgh Festival to stage large literary conferences ‚Äì the first of their kind ‚Äì which in 1962 and 1963 were immensely successful. They attracted many of the world's leading writers, as well as others whose names were not yet familiar to the public.  Controversy  Following their visit to Scotland, Calder began to publish the previously banned work of writers Henry Miller and William S. Burroughs. Controversy also surrounded the publication of Alexander Trocchi's Cain's Book, which was a success despite a minor obscenity trial in Sheffield. Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, although well reviewed, had a more serious case brought against it, first in a private prosecution by Tory MP Cyril Black, and then at the Old Bailey. John Mortimer led a successful appeal and the company was vindicated after losing in both lower courts.  Ownership In 1963 the company changed its name to Calder and Boyars to accommodate a new partner (Marion Boyars, who subsequently founded Marion Boyars Publishers), but the company went back to its original name when the partnership was dissolved in 1975. In 2007, Calder Publications was acquired by Oneworld Classics, a joint venture between Alma Books and Oneworld Publications. In 2012, Alma Books acquired full ownership of Calder and Oneworld Classics, renaming the latter Alma Classics.Williams, Charlotte (2 April 2012), \\"Alma gets classical with 300-strong list\\", The Bookseller.

Its boundary with Trev√©lez and Capileira runs along the highest ridge of the Sierra Nevada, and over Mulhac√©n, making these the three highest municipalities in peninsular Spain. The Genil and Maitena rivers rise in G√º√©jar. History The castle of El Castillejo, the ruins of which can still be seen just above the village, was built by the Romans, but it was the Moors who settled the village after their conquest of Spain in 711, giving it the name of Qaryat Walyar. It remained in Moorish hands until 25 November 1491, when it was taken by Christian forces during the final phase of the Reconquista. In December 1499 the people of G√º√©jar took part in a rebellion which had in part been provoked by forced conversions, but they were defeated in January 1500. As a result, 2,500 villagers who had previously been baptized as Christians were taken to Granada and sold as slaves. 1568 saw the start of the Morisco Revolt, led by Aben Humeya, which lasted until 1571, although in G√º√©jar it was put down in 1569.G√º√©jar Sierra municipal website (Spanish) Tourism G√º√©jar Sierra has a long history as a popular tourist destination. As long ago as the early 1920s the Duke of San Pedro Galatino, owner of the famous Alhambra Palace Hotel in Granada, decided to build a luxurious mountain lodge in the untouched countryside above G√º√©jar. The hotel, which offered guests all of the comforts of the time, such as electricity, central heating and hot water, was inaugurated on 20 March 1925. The Duke had also long dreamed of constructing a tramline from Granada to just above G√º√©jar, from where it would only be a short carriage ride to the hotel. By financing almost a third of the cost himself, he was eventually able to get the first section completed in 1925, and extensions were added in 1928 and 1944. The project was an incredible feat of engineering, with 14 tunnels and 21 bridges, but it was never a financial success, and in 1973 it was finally closed down.G√º√©jar Sierra municipal website The hotel was also loss-making, and was donated by the Duke to the Diocese of Granada in 1936. Shortly afterwards the Spanish Civil War broke out, and as the front line ran very close to the hotel, it was used as barracks, and was badly damaged as a result. In 1950 it became a seminary. G√º√©jar Sierra is a main gateway to the northern faces of Mulhac√©n, Alcazaba and Veleta, and is also the starting point for the Vereda de la Estrella, one of the most famous hikes in the Sierra Nevada. As a result, tourism remains one of the mainstays of the local economy.

Paleoanthropology  Orce is the location of the paleo- archaeological sites known as Barranco Le√≥n, Venta Micena, and Fuente Nueva 3, near the basin of an ancient lake where fossils have been preserved in sediment. Josep Gibert of the M. Crusafont Institute in Sabadell has led an excavation team there. He asserts that the sites have Oldowan-style stone tools dating between 1.5 and 1.8 million years ago. If the early estimates are supported, these would represent the oldest stone tool finds in Europe. Other scholars prefer a more conservative date for the stone tools of 1.2 million years. Together with the hominid remains at the Atapuerca Mountains, the tools are evidence that human ancestors settled in western Europe more than one million years (Ma) ago. Recent numerical dating studies using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) method applied to fossil teeth and quartz grains have provided ages of ca. 1.2 Ma for Fuente Nueva 3, and ca. 1.4 Ma for Barranco Le√≥n and Venta Micena.

The name is derived from Ancient Greek ozo \\"smell\\" and Latin porus \\"pore, small opening\\". Harvestmen Ozopore on an elevated ozophore above the eye of Pettalus (Cyphophthalmi) In harvestmen, ozopores are located at the anterior sides of the prosoma. The defensive secretions emitted also act as an alarm pheromone. The glands are infoldings of the body wall, consisting of three layers. Although the glands themselves have no musculature, there is associated musculature present, which is most elaborate in the harvestman suborder Cyphophthalmi. Eupnoi and Dyspnoi have the most reduced muscular system. (2007): Defensive Mechanisms. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 382ffPinto-da- Rocha et al. 2007: 382ff This defensive behavior is considered most effective in the suborders Cyphophthalmi and Laniatores. In the suborder Cyphophthalmi, the ozopores are located on special ozophores, specialized elevated cones. Many different compounds have been found in various studied harvestman secretions. The chemical composition of the secretions seems to be useful in taxonomic recognition. In the Laniatores, Gonyleptoidea produce alkylated benzoquinones and phenols, and Travunioidea produce mainly terpenoids. In the Eupnoi, the Sclerosomatidae secrete short-chain acyclic ketones and alcohols, and the Phalangiidae, naphthoquinones. Millipedes In millipedes, ozopores are repeated serially on body segments, and usually situated laterally. Exceptions are members of the order Glomerida, which have ozopores located dorsally.

Rubite is a locality and Spanish municipality situated at the east central of the region \\"La Costa Granadina\\" in the province of Granada, independent community of Andalusia. On the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, Rubite is bordered by the municipalities of L√∫jar, √ìrgiva and Polopos.  Location and landscape  Nestled in the southwest of the province of Granada, Rubite is at the bottom of the Sierra de Lujar and Contraviesa, 80 km away from Granada capital. The access can be done from the coast via a route that connects with the N -340 as it passes through Castell de Ferro (15 km.), and from the C -333 through the scenic road Contraviesa. The peaceful streets of Moorish design and the hospitality of its people make Rubite a special corner where mass tourism has not yet taken a toll. Its geographical location allows you to enjoy the sea and mountain, counting in their municipality the beaches of El Lance and Casarones. The landscape around the village is beautiful, formed by a harmonious combination between forms of mountainous terrain, whimsical and impossible ravines, patches of natural vegetation and traditional crops of almonds, grapes, figs, with the Mediterranean Sea at its feet and the peaks of Sierra Nevada as a roof.  Customs  The grape harvest celebrated in October is maybe the only tradition that remains nowadays where the grapes are trampled with \\"agobias\\" (little straw shoes). The wine of Rubite is really important for the region of La Alpujarra.  History  Rubite is a mozarabic word and a Latin word \\"Rubus-Robetum\\" that means bramble. The first record of the town dates from the Andalusian period Between the 13th and 15th centuries in the Sierra de la Contraviesa. In the 16th century a significant number fled the North African Moors, leaving the area unpopulated but in the repopulation of the 18th century, the area increased markedly in population and economic prosperity. In the 17th century the sale of land and houses to farmers in the region was authorized, although paying the Count of Cifuentes. The decline of grape growing in the 19th century forced the village to make almonds its main production. The Rubite√±os have been called lifelong G√ºenos of Rubite. The origin lies in an occurrence of the early 19th century . There was by then a family surnamed \\"Bueno\\". In autumn 1810 a routine patrol of the French army was surprised by Bueno family members on their properties. In the confrontation, French soldiers were killed. The story spread quickly through the surrounding area, leaving the Buenos as an example of patriotism for all residents.

According to the 2005 census (INE), the town (pueblo) has a population of 736 inhabitants. It is famous for its yearly Moors and Christians performance held on 15 September as part of the festival to the patron saint, the Holy Christ of the Ivy (Santo Cristo de la Yedra) an impressive statue of Christ on His Cross brought out in procession through the pueblo on 14 September. The Moors and Christians performance, which is said to re-enact the Moriscos revolt is staged on the main square next to the Church building and includes dialogues between the main protagonists leading both armies (King, general and ambassador on horseback and the spy/jester on foot), and episodes of fighting between the foot soldiers who fire blanks with their shotguns and flintlock rifles. The existing script of the play was written in the 1860s by the woman poet from Granada Enriqueta Lozano. The traditional way of life of the local society was very vividly described by Gerald Brenan.Gerald Brenan, South From Granada: Seven Years in an Andalusian Village , London, 1957 Brenan lived through the 1920s in the village of Yegen, close to V√°lor. Like in other pueblos of the region, local society was divided by social and political conflicts after 1931‚Äîopposing groups of rural socialist workers to the local political bosses (caciques) and their henchmen. During the Spanish Civil War, it was briefly controlled by the rebels then taken by a column of militiamen coming from the coast. It remained in the Republican zone until the end of the war. Like in most places through the region repression was severe after Francisco Franco's victory and most people associated with the Left were eliminated (some were executed) or forced to leave the region. Until the 1970s, the local economy was based on the traditional Andalusian cultures (cereals, olive trees, vineyards) on small plots of land difficult to exploit because of the mountainous terrain. Traditionally most agricultural laborers were forced to do seasonal work in the plains of Andalusia at harvest time.

It is headquartered in Vaasa, Finland. From a modest start in the timber industry, by 1939 it was the biggest timber exporter in Finland, accounting for 26% of the country's total lumber exports and some 20% of pulpwood exports . The company was the world's largest fox and mink fur producer in the 1960s and 1970s, producing approximately 10% of all Finnish mink furs, equivalent to 2% of world production in 1973.KWH Group Ltd: The history of KWH Group After expanding into plastics production in the 1950s, the company was the first in Finland to manufacture expanded polystyrene sheets with its brand name Styrox. Establishing a niche in plastic pipe manufacturing, the company was the first in the world to manufacture a 600 mm diameter pipe in 1964, thereby gaining international recognition.Wester, Holger and Stjernschantz, G√∂ran: Wiik & H√∂glund 1929-1979 () Today, the Mirka Group (previously KWH Mirka Group until 2016) is one of the largest manufacturers in the world in terms of volume in the \\"flexible abrasives materials\\" industry.KWH Group Ltd: Annual Review 2016 History Wiik & H√∂glund Emil H√∂glund and Edvin Wiik were both in the timber business. Emil H√∂glund worked as a clerk and Edvin Wiik worked as an independent buyer of timber for the Helln√§s sawmills. As the sawmill was expected to foreclose, both were faced with unemployment. Discussing their options, they decided to establish their own company, Wiik & H√∂glund, which was founded on 28 August 1929. The company was to engage in trade in round timber, pit props and pulpwood. Wiik acted as a buyer, and H√∂glund, having studied at a commercial college and spent some time in England in 1928, was responsible for sales and bookkeeping. Though they had a prosperous first year in business the company also faced periodic difficulties, for example during the Depression years of 1930-1933. However, in the late 1930s, the company expanded fast, and became one of the major round timber exporters in Finland, with Emil H√∂glund travelling as a salesman to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Britain. By 1939 Wiik & H√∂glund was the biggest timber exporter in Finland, accounting for 26% of the country's total lumber exports and some 20% of pulpwood exports. Their commercial success allowed them to make investments outside their own company operations, and in 1937 they become a major shareholder in the Jakobstads Cellulosa Ab pulp company (majority owned by Oy Wilh. Schauman Ab), and in 1939 they took a significant stake in the Vasa Rederi Ab shipping company, later buying up the entire stock. Their holding in Jakobstads Cellulosa Ab also increased, and in the 1960s Wiik & H√∂glund and Keppo jointly held 15% of Oy Wilh. Schauman Ab, making them the biggest private shareholder. During the war years, Wiik & H√∂glund exports were virtually halted, and other products were produced to compensate for the loss of exports. Firewood and woodchips now became the most important products, and were mainly purchased by the German and Finnish armies, as well as Finnish State authorities. After the war, exports of round timber started up again and the company's previous customers in West Germany, France and the Netherlands again became the biggest trading partners. Profitability was good and profits were re-invested into fixed assets, mainly forest. The most important investment came in autumn 1951, when the plastics company Holmsund AB in Ume√•, Sweden, one of Wiik & H√∂glund's customers, offered them the sole manufacturing rights in Finland. The production started in Vaasa in 1951, and moved to new premises in 1952, where KWH Group's and Uponor's joint venture plastic pipe plant, Uponor Infra Ltd, is still located today. Wiik & H√∂glund made major investments and acquisitions to expand their plastics business. In 1954, the Vaasa firm Lars Berts was purchased, and in 1955 the first plastic pipes were produced. Wiik & H√∂glund was also the first company in Finland to make expanded polystyrene sheets, which were marketed under the brand name Styrox, a name that is synonymous today in Finland with all products made of this raw material.Wester, Holger and Stjernschantz, G√∂ran: Wiik & H√∂glund 1929-1979 () Other companies that were acquired were Forss & Govenius and Nars, both from Jakobstad, which have developed into today's KWH Plast.Wester, Holger and KWH Plast: Fr√•n vaxduk till plastfolier - KWH plast 1943-1993 () In 1969, Wiik & H√∂glund and Oy Finlayson Ab jointly purchased a rival polyethylene pipe company Muovitehdas Oy in Ulvila, becoming a Wiik & H√∂glund subsidiary in 1986 during a restructuring of the pipe business. In the 1970s, Wiik & H√∂glund embarked on several large international projects, later to be formed into the WH Pipe International division. Pipe projects in Brazil, Iraq, South Korea and Thailand increased the company's familiarity with these markets. Restructuring and concentration on certain products continued in the 1980s, while the company continued to expand abroad. Factories making polyethylene pipes were set up in Denmark, Thailand, Canada, and in 1990 in Malaysia and Portugal. Industrial piping was added to the production programme when Oy Muotekno Ab, Oy Sul-Mu Ab, Laurolon Oy, Plastilon Oy and the French company Sipap Pipe Systems S.A. joined the Group. As a result of restructuring in the Group, the complete pipe manufacturing was transferred to KWH Pipe, which today is a part of Uponor Infra Ltd, a joint venture between Uponor's and KWH Group's infrastructure businesses.KWH Group Ltd: The history of KWH Group 1929-2004 Keppo The site of the Keppo mansion has been characterized by small- scale industrial activities for several centuries. With the Keppo rapids providing access to water power, and in combination with the close proximity to the shipping port in Nykarleby, alderman Samuel Lithovius recognized a business opportunity for processing timber from the surrounding forests, and setup up a water-powered sawmill at the site in about 1740.Kronlund, Johannes: Kepposl√§kten Nystrand p.4 (1986) Subsequent owners developed the site further with a tobacco plantation, spinning mill, pitch works and a linen-, cotton- and textile-mill until 1829 when Keppo was acquired by Carl Otto von Essen.Uppslagsverket Finland: 2:a verket FIM-KEP (2004) () During the time of Otto von Essen, the sawmill experienced a boom in business. Peter Malm from Jakobstad, a well-known shipowner and industrialist, became a corporate member at the sawmill in 1840. He financed the sawmill and sold the finished products, while von Essen worked as saw inspector and timber purchaser. In the 1860s, the annual production exceeded ten thousand logs. A fire in 1893 destroyed the sawmill, and no saw mill has been operational at the Keppo rapids since. The von Essen family owned the Keppo mansion until 1899 when Hugo Gr√∂nlund acquired it, who then sold it to the Wilhelm Schauman Ab company in Jakobstad in 1906.Backman, Woldemar: Keppo g√•rd (1944) (OCLC 58083532) Viktor Schauman, the son of Wilhelm Schauman, bought the Keppo Mansion in 1918, and after a renovation, lived at the mansion with his wife until 1930, when the mansion was again sold. The main building then became an evangelical High School, and was owned by the guarantee association during 1930-1942. After a period as army accommodation during World War II, the house was again bought and restored by the Viktor Schauman family, who lived at the mansion until 1954. In parallel with his activities within the Wiik & H√∂glund company, Emil H√∂glund had been active in mink farming already since 1937, first together with Karl Johan Stuns from V√∂r√• until 1944, and later with Karl-Johan Tidstr√∂m. Their farming activities expanded rapidly over the following decades and in 1953, the systematic breeding programmes had resulted in a unique mutation, the Finlandia Topaz, which gained worldwide recognition. In 1954, Emil H√∂glund and Karl-Johan Tidstr√∂m bought the Keppo mansion with the accompanying 37 hectares of cultivated land and 418 hectares of forest, establishing the company Keppo Ltd. All their mink farming activities were now owned by Keppo Ltd, and a new mink farm was established next to the old mansion. This farm also experienced rapid growth and became the biggest mink farm in the world by 1962. Peak production was reached in the 1970s, when approximately 130,000 skins were produced at the Keppo farm, while the production of all of the Keppo owned farms together were approximately 480,000 mink- and 150,000 fox-skins.Wester, Holger: Keppo ‚Äì G√•rden och dess folk () KWH Group KWH Group was formed in 1984, when Oy Keppo Ab purchased the remaining half of Oy Wiik & H√∂glund Ab's shares that it did not already own, from the Wiik family. Oy Keppo Ab had already purchased half of the company from the H√∂glund family in 1981. The conglomerate was restructured in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and several divestitures were made, most notable the selling of approximately 13,000 hectares of forest and the share holdings in Oy Wilh. Schauman Ab, as well as the gradual selling of all activities related to the mink and fox farming business. According to the new strategy, the Group's resources were to be focused on developing its core operations, which were defined as KWH Pipe, KWH Plast and KWH Mirka. All other aspects of the operations were gathered together within KWH Invest. In the beginning, KWH Pipe received the lion's share of new investments. A new production facility was opened in 1990 in Portugal,Research and Market Plastics - Global Outlook 2006 output in Canada was doubled and new and expanded production facilities were opened in Malaysia and Thailand, while operations in India began in 1992 in the form of a joint venture. Additional investments were made in Sweden, Poland and Germany. However, due to changing market conditions, the operations in China, Germany, the US and India have since closed. KWH Pipe is part of Uponor Infra since 2013. A second area of investment was KWH Mirka (Mirka since 2016), which from modest beginnings now has achieved a leading position,Nordman, Kurt: Keih√§√§nk√§rki√§ - Kolmetoista kertomusta suomalaisesta huipputekniikasta () especially in automotive refinishing (ART). In volume terms, Mirka is one of the five biggest operators globally in the coated abrasives sector. In 1999, Prevex became a subsidiary of the KWH Group following the purchase of additional shares, and in 2003, Prevex became a fully owned subsidiary. In 2003, Oy Prevex Ab was the most important part of the KWH Invest division. Divisions Mirka Mirka (KWH Mirka until 2016) manufactures coated and non-woven abrasives and electric sanding machines in its locations in Jeppo, Oravais, Jakobstad and Karis, all in Finland. The core business segments are automotive refinishing and industrial finishing. Mirka exports about 96% of the production mainly to Europe, the US and Far East. The product range includes abrasive materials, polishing compounds and sanding machines for different types of abrasive processes in automotive refinishing and production (OEM), the manufacture of composite parts, furniture production, metal processing and for sales via the hardware, paint and machinery trades. Sales are increasingly in the form of systems sales, for which reason the product programme has been augmented by products such as sanding discs, backing pads, sanding and polishing machines, vacuum cleaners and other accessories. Mirka is one of the global market leaders in its largest business segment, Surface Finishing (including automotive refinish (ART)), automobile manufacturing (OEM) including subcontractors), marine and composite. In the Wood market segment, focus has been on small and medium- sized users. The Power Tools business unit is formed for the manufacture and developing of sanding machines and accessories. The development unit Engineered Surface Finishing develops microproducts for the OEM sector and searches for new attractive market areas. KWH Logistics KWH Logistics consists of four business units: KWH Freeze (Cold Storage): cold storages in Vantaa and Inkoo, Finland; Port & Sea, Freight Forwarding and Industrial Services: port operations, freight forwarding and international transport.

Pelvic kidneys occur in 1 in every 500 people in the U.S. It is not a harmful condition generally, but can develop complications.  Causes  In the development of the human embryo, the metanephric kidneys fail to ascend and usually remain at the brim of the pelvis. This clinical scenario may present no signs or symptoms and the kidneys may function normally. It is associated at times with Mullerian dysgenesis.

It was called by Premier Robert Ghiz on September 17, 2007. The by- election was caused by the decision of PC MLA and former Premier Pat Binns to resign after he was appointed ambassador to the Republic of Ireland by Stephen Harper, following his election loss in the 2007 provincial election. The Liberal candidate was Charlie McGeoghegan, who had come within 400 votes of defeating Binns in the provincial election. The PC candidate was chosen on September 21, 2007, while both the NDP and the Greens had announced their candidates, as well; a former Liberal ran as an independent.

The film was directed by Peter Bogdanovich with Rob Lowe starring as Richard Dice, the college dropout who came back home to get his act together. The film's theme song was performed by Johnny Cash. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Bogdanovich himself considers this movie one of his worst. In an interview, he stated, \\"I'm not positive, but it just might be my penance for getting on the bad side of all those studio execs while shooting Mask, three years earlier.\\" Cast * Rob Lowe as Richard Dice * Colleen Camp as Molly Gilbert * Kenneth Mars as Hal B.

Taylor as Honey Bunny, the Judges Wife * Ira Heiden as Andrew Dice Production Bogdanovich was going to direct Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastrioanni in Saturday Sunday Monday but the film was delayed so he did this instead. \\"I only did it because I needed some money\\", said Bogdanovich, who had declared bankruptcy in 1985. The film was a change of pace for Rob Lowe, who was much in demand at the time due to the success of About Last Night. Lowe admired Bogdanovich's films and hoped the movie would do for him what What's Up Doc? did for Ryan O'Neal.Lowe p 228-229 Bogdanovich says he encouraged Lowe to wear glasses like the actor did in real life. Bogdanovich showed Lowe The Awful Truth and Bringing Up Baby to show what he wanted. Lowe felt the movie needed a name co-star but Bogdanovich insisted he use his old friend and collaborator Colleen Camp. Lowe says Bogdanovich insisted on rewriting the script, which made the actor uneasy since he liked the original script. Part of the rewrites involved adding a character to be played by L. B. Straten.Lowe p 229 L.B. Straten was Louise Stratten, sister of Dorothy Stratten who had dated Bogdanovich. Louise Stratten and Bogdanovich would later be married. Lowe said he went along with the changes because he \\"loved Peter\\" although he ultimately felt \\"every artist can chase his own vision into a blind alley. And on Illegally Yours he did just that.\\" Shooting Filming started in January 1987 and went until April. |\\"There were constant weather problems\\", Bogdanovich says. \\"We were shooting in northern Florida under two different weather fronts. There was also pressure to complete the movie in time for summer release--something that became more and more difficult to do.\\" Pat MacEnulty, who worked on the film, recalled \\"the crew practically mutinied.\\" Reception The film was originally meant to come out on July 31, 1987. However, during a test screening, reportedly half the audience walked out and the release date was pushed back to May 1988. Associate producer Peggy Robertson said \\"We went in knowing the film wasn't ready. Peter knew what was missing and had accommodated for it, but the audience didn't.... Peter tried [to make the July release date] but it boiled down to, \`Do you want it quick or do you want it good?' We just finished filming in April, so I don't think anyone was surprised when it didn't work out.\\" A DEG spokesman said It told us a movie was there and the audience we were aiming for (women between 18 and 25) was responding. That's the reason we're taking our time now. It's not just another programmer.\\" The De Laurentis Group ran into financial troubles and the release date kept being changed. This affected other films from the producer too \\"All the films are in limbo until (the group's problems) are resolved\\", said Bodganovich. \\"It takes a lot of time because there's a lot of banks and different people involved, but I'm assured by DEG that it will come out either by them or another distributor... It's been a tough ride for Dino. He's just had a hard run of luck.\\" \\"We showed this picture to kids, and they were screaming\\", he said. \\"Critics have to say, \`Bogdanovich is doing this in the tradition of screwball comedy' because that's what it is and they're stuck with saying it. But kids just see that [Rob Lowe] is falling down, and there's an excitement about that because they haven't seen it before.\\" Bogdanovich he had \\"high hopes for\\" the film \\"but it was re-cut completely by Dino De Laurentiis.\\" The film was a financial and critical failure. Bogdanovich later called it \\"awful... I don't even like to mention it.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 0% based on reviews from 5 critics. Variety called it \\"an embarrassingly unfunny attempt at screwball comedy, marking a career nadir for producer-director Peter Bogdanovich and his miscast star Rob Lowe.\\" References Notes * External links  * Category:1988 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Florida Category:1988 comedy films Category:Films directed by Peter Bogdanovich Category:American comedy films Category:United Artists films Category:De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films ","title":"Illegally Yours"},{"id":"13123602","text":"Ahmed Al Swaileh (; born 14 May 1986) is a Saudi Arabian football player for Hajer Club.

Kennedy. Jacobson came to be known as \\"Miracle Max\\" and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" because he administered highly addictive ‚Äúvitamin shots‚Äù laced with various substances that included amphetamine and methamphetamine. Largely unknown to the public until his methods were exposed by The New York Times in 1972, Jacobson was charged with unprofessional conduct and fraud in 1973. He eventually lost his medical license in 1975. Jacobson died in December 1979 having never regained his medical license. Early life and education Born in the German Empire, Jacobson earned his medical degree from the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin (now the Humboldt University of Berlin). Jacobson, who was Jewish, fled Nazi Germany in 1936. He emigrated to the United States where he established an office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Career Jacobson treated many famous clients, including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Leonard Bernstein, Humphrey Bogart, Yul Brynner, Maria Callas, Truman Capote, Van Cliburn, Montgomery Clift, Rosemary Clooney, Bob Cummings, Maya Deren, Cecil B. DeMille, Marlene Dietrich, Eddie Fisher, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, Alan Jay Lerner, Mickey Mantle, Liza Minnelli, Thelonious Monk, Marilyn Monroe, Zero Mostel, Elvis Presley, Anthony Quinn, Paul Robeson, Nelson Rockefeller, David O. Selznick, Elizabeth Taylor, Billy Wilder and Tennessee Williams. Dubbed \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", Jacobson was known for his \\"miracle tissue regenerator\\" shots, which consisted of amphetamines, animal hormones, bone marrow, enzymes, human placenta, painkillers, steroids, and multivitamins. Treating John F. Kennedy In September 1960, then-Senator John F. Kennedy first visited Jacobson shortly before the 1960 presidential election debates. Jacobson was part of the presidential entourage at the Vienna summit in 1961, where he administered injections to combat severe back pain. Some of the potential side effects included hyperactivity, impaired judgment, nervousness, and wild mood swings. Kennedy, however, was untroubled by Food and Drug Administration reports on the contents of Jacobson‚Äôs injections, and proclaimed: \\"I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs horse piss. It works.\\" Jacobson was used for the most severe bouts of back pain.Reeves, Richard (1993), President Kennedy: Profile of Power, pp. 42, 158-159. By May 1962, Jacobson had visited the White House to treat the president thirty-four times, although such treatments were stopped by President Kennedy's White House physicians, who realized the inappropriate use of steroids and amphetamines administered by Jacobson. It was later observed that President Kennedy's leadership, specifically during the Cuban Missile Crisis and other events during 1963, improved greatly once Jacobson's treatments were discontinued and replaced by a medically appropriate regimen. Dr. Ghaemi, who studied Kennedy's medical records, concluded there was a \\"correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either\\". Later years and death By the late-1960s, Jacobson's behavior became increasingly erratic as his own amphetamine usage increased. He began working 24-hour days and was seeing up to thirty patients per day. In 1969, one of Jacobson's clients, former presidential photographer Mark Shaw, died at the age of 47. An autopsy showed that Shaw had died of \\"acute and chronic intravenous amphetamine poisoning.\\" Under questioning, Jacobson's staff admitted to buying large quantities of amphetamines to give many high level doses. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs seized Jacobson's supply, and his medical license was revoked on 25 April 1975, by the New York State Board of Regents. In 1979, Jacobson attempted to regain his license but was denied. A state spokesman stated that the then 79-year-old Jacobson did not seem ready to enter into the \\"mainstream of practice\\" again. Jacobson died later that year on 1 December in New York City. His funeral was held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan on 3 December. Jacobson is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery next to his second wife Nina (who died in 1964) and his parents.

It portrayed medieval English villagers fearful of the turn of the new (second) millennium in the year 999 AD, and parodied contemporary fears at the turn of the third millennium (such as the Millennium Bug) in 1999. It was written by Rob Grant and directed by Steve Bendelack.  Production  Dark Ages was created by Merle Nygate in 1996 and commissioned by Granada Television for development. Producer Justin Judd and Nygate could not make the concept work for an ITV audience, so Nygate was replaced by Rob Grant, better known for writing Red Dwarf for BBC Two. Grant's new scripts for Dark Ages were described by Judd as being more suited for a BBC Two audience, and Grant was required to alter them accordingly. Though a lot of scenes featuring computer-generated effects were required, Dark Ages still had a regular sitcom budget of no more than ¬£200,000. Location filming of the village was done for a week at West Stow Anglo-Saxon village in Suffolk. Production then moved into a studio for five weeks between April and May 1999 to film scenes in front of a live audience. The costume designer was inspired by the works of Bruegel and from research visits to the Jorvik Viking Centre.

Goddard served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Central Saints mission, assigned to places such as Manitoba and Minnesota in about 1948-1950. He resumed his world traveling shortly after his mission, heading to Foggia in Italy.For the Cause of Righteousness: A Global History of Blacks and Mormonism, 1830-2013 (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2014), p. 92-93 He began pursuing the goals on his list in earnest, and in 1951 became the first man to navigate the entire length of the Nile river in a kayak; this and subsequent adventures, such as exploring the Congo River in 1956 and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 1968, fueled a successful career on the lecture circuit. He was also the first person to conduct an exploration of the entire Congo River. Starting in 1950 Goddard spent much time in Uganda and surrounding areas. He originally had a negative view towards the native medicine in Uganda, but had a complex view, both praising and condemning various aspects of the society at large.Stevenson, For the Cause of Righteousness, p. 94-95 After his kayaking trip down the whole length of the Nile, Goddard studied anthropology at the University of Southern California.Stevenson, For the Cause of Righteousness, p. 95 Over time he came to have a much more positive view of medicine men in Uganda and surrounding regions, by the 1980s declaring they had a sincere desire to help their people.Sevenson, For the Cause of Righteousness, p. 95 Goddard wrote two books: The Survivor (), and Kayaks Down the Nile (), an account of his trip from source to the mouth of the White Nile in kayaks accompanied by two French friends in 1950,Goddard, John (1979).

Moreover, he acted as a diplomat and important art dealer. His paintings formed the basis and the beginning of the collection in the Hermitage Museum. Gotzkowsky died impoverished with leaving of an autobiography: Geschichte eines patriotischen Kaufmanns (1768), with a French translation and three reprints in the 18th century. Biography Gotzkowsky was born in Konitz (Chojnice) in Royal Prussia, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and descended from an impoverished family of Polish nobility. Both his parents died when he was five years as a result of the plague, which broke out after the Great Northern War. Gotzkowsky grew up with relatives in Dresden, who neglected his education. As a 14-year-old he went to Berlin to live with his brother and to apprentice in business with Adrian Spr√∂gel till 1730. When Spr√∂gel's business burned down, he joined his brother in the haberdashery.The Spirit of Capitalism: Nationalism and Economic Growth by Liah Greenfeld, p. 165N. Schepkowski, p. 13 He established him in his jewel and trinket shop and he quickly acquired customers in the highest circles; Sophia Dorothea of Hanover was his best client. After he met with Frederick the Great Gotzkowsky became royal warrant. In 1741 he became a Freemason. In 1745, he married the daughter of the rich lace maker Blume. Gotzkowsky persuaded his father-in-law to start a velvet factory, which he managed and inherited in the year after. Then Frederick II commissioned Gotzkowsky to promote the silk trade to compete with France; since 1752/3 Gotzkowsky ran a silk factory employing 1,500 persons. Frederick also followed his recommendations in the field of toll levies and import restrictions. Gotzkowsky lived at Br√ºderstra√üe 13, Berlin, Mitte The merchant Gotzkowsky asks the Russian commander lying on the sofa (Tottleben?) to indulge the city of Berlin During the Seven Years' War Gotzkowsky supplied the Prussian army and entered into consultation with Russian and Austrian army leaders, especially after the Prussian defeat at Kunersdorf in August 1759. On 9 October 1760 Berlin's City Council decided to surrender the city formally to the Russians rather than the Austrians, as Austria was Prussia's bitterest enemy. The Russians immediately made a demand for 4 million thalers in exchange for the protection of private property. On 11 October Gotzkowsky took over the negotiations on behalf of the city council and was able to persuade Heinrich von Tottleben to reduce the levy to 1.5 million thalers.Franz Szabo, The Seven Years War in Europe, 1756-1763, Upper Saddle River: Pearson, 2008, p. 293. .N. Schepkowsky, p. 261-262 with only 500,000 thalers, collected among the city's merchants, payable immediately in prewar coins?L. Greenfeld, p. 107 Tottleben moved into his house but left on the 13th. Later that month, Gotzkowsky traveled to K√∂nigsberg in Prussia as a guarantor for the redemption money. He was arrested, and released after promising a deposit of 62.000 (or 150.000 thaler)?http://syw- cwg.narod.ru/Brl_60_doc3.html Gotzkowsky succeeded to involve a Hamburg bank, owned by Philipp Heinrich II von Stenglin (1718‚Äì1793) to pay the amount, but the Russians received only 57.437 thaler in debased Saxonian coins. Again Gotzkowsky traveled to Danzig to bribe the Russian generals with 24 golden snuff boxes.N. Schepkowski, p. 263-264 In February 1761 Von Tottleben was accused of treason. (The sources are confusing.) Gotzkowsky mentions that Ephraim & Itzig sent him loads of (debased) coins at the beginning of October, which he stored in his cellar.Gotzkowsky, p. 21 According to himself, the production of more debased coins began at the end of October to pay off the Russians and the Austrians.Gotzkowsky, p. 29-30 At the same time Gotzkowsky supported Saxony to pay its war contribution to Prussia.Gotzkowsky, p. 135, 140-142 In the summer of 1761 he ordered 400.000 thaler in debased coins not from the Prussian mint masters, but from Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann.L. Beutin, p. 264, 281 Since August Schimmelmann produced debased coins in Rethwisch, and sent for 100.000 thaler to Leipzig.Gotzkowsky, p. 111 As the (foreign) debased coins, like Pl√∂ner and Zerbster, Bernburger coins were not accepted (by Frederick and Ephraim & Itzig) Gotzkowsky suggested to spread half of the amount under the Allies.N.

To the left the K√∂nigliche Gold- und Silbermanufaktur (Wilhelmsstra√üe No. 79), rented by Ephraim In January Gotzkowsky remarried a 25-year-old ballet-dancer. In April 1763 Gotzkowsky and Leendert Pieter de Neufville paid a visit to Frederick. On 19 April they bought a huge amount of grain (oats) from the Russian envoy Vladimir Sergeevich Dolgorukov (1717 - 1803).E. Ris, p. 37-38, 54; H. Rachel & P. Wallich, p. 448 It was stored in Kolberg and unuseful after the Russian army had left the Poland. Because of a shortage in Prussia, the transaction could have been profitable for Gotzkowsky and De Neufville, collaborating with two partners (Von Stein and Leveaux). Legal problems caused the grain to not be exported.E. Ris, p. 47 When it became clear that half of the grain turned out to be of bad quality, Gotzkowsky preferred to change the contract and offered to pay 2/3 of 1.2 million guilders. The Russians refused and insisted to be paid promptly in Dutch guilders, and not in debased Prussian coins.E. Ris, p. 38, 39, 45, 54, 56, etc Leveaux and Von Stein dropping out of grain deal must have been a shock to Neufville and Gotzkowsky. The restructuring of the Gotzkowsky deal put tremendous pressure on both men. By the end of July 1763, Gotzkowsky had difficulty paying the lacking 700.000 and feared to go bankrupt.N. Schepkowski, pp. 340-343Gotzkowsky, p. 147-150 Gotzkowsky had also an impressive number of paintings in stock which he had not sold to Frederick during the war and managed a silkworks, a jewelry business in Leipzig with J.R. Streckfuss, a porcelain factory (now KPM) that was not running at his satisfactory, all at the same time. On 2 August the infamous Amsterdam company De Neufville was not able to assist and borrow the money from the banks in Amsterdam. The next day De Neufville asked for a postponement of payment. On 4 August Gotzkowsky asked for a deferral.E. Ris, p. 57 The deferrals resulted to an international financial crisis in Hamburg (90-97), Frankfurt (30), Berlin (33), Danzig, Breslau, Stockholm, London and Amsterdam (38).Henderson, W.O.

On 30 January 1764, Gotzkowsky applied for his bankruptcy. In April 1764, Gotzkowsky offered 50% compensation to his creditors. Gotzkowsky died in 1775 in Berlin.

In 1761 he bought a painting by the Prussian Jakob Philipp Hackert.https://daxermarschall.com/en/wp- content/uploads/2018/02/Hacket_Icon.jpg On 10 December 1763 when Gotzkowsky was unable to pay for the Russian grain Gotzkowsky decided to provide 317 paintings, including 90 not precisely known, to the Russian crown to satisfy the obligations of Catherine the Great.

This last painting came from the collection of the Amsterdam cloth dealer Jan J. Hinlopen. It is possible that De Neufville sold some of his paintings to Gotzkowsky by hand.N. Schepkowsky, p. 218 A focal point of Berlin society during the war years was the residence of Gotzkowsky, whose gardens and paintings were admired both by the old nobility and new bourgeoisie.Henderson, W.O.

KPM In 1761, Frederick ordered Gotzkowsky to take over the porcelain factory of Wilhelm Caspar Wegely, which had struggled because of the Seven Years' War.Gotzkowsky, p. 65 Gotzkowsky attracted competent staff from Meissen, which was occupied in 1760 by the Prussian army. A relief on Meissen porcelain was named after him.https://www.auktionshaus- stahl.de/ressourcen/auktionen/315/76730-0.jpg Frederick the Great took over the factory on 24 August 1763 when Gotzkowsky was in serious trouble. The company is still known as the Royal Porcelain Manufacture (KPM). The \\"manufacture\\" was located at Leipziger Strasse 3 and 4, not far from Potsdamer Platz where now the Bundesrat of Germany is located. The factory had twelve furnaces and 400 men in service. Frederick, who was his best customer, demanded of the Jewish traders and the lotterie to take his porcelain in their assortment.MacDonogh, G. (1999) Frederick the Great. A life in deed and letters, p. 140, 180, 294, 299-300, 317, 331, 354. The former silk and porcelain factory was from 1825 up to 1851 in the possession of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who had built a very representative mansion on the property. From 1871 there the Reichstag stood, during the German Empire. A street, a bridge and a school in Berlin are named in honor of Gotzkowsky. References Sources * L.K.J.

She worked as a journalist and screenwriter, as well as an independent author in the field of hermetic philosophy since 1941. She would sometimes write under the pseudonyms M√°ria Papir or M√°ria Orsi. Life Szepes was born Magdolna Scherbach into a Hungarian family of theater stars in Budapest. Her father, S√°ndor Papir, was a bon vivant and great star of Budapest's stages. Her mother was primadonna. Her parents and her brother were to her like \\"brothers and sisters in spirit\\", as well as she admitted only spiritual relationship: \\"Everything else is just experience, engagement, disengagement ‚Äì karma.\\" From 1916 to 1933, she appeared as a film actress (mostly under the name Magda Papir). One year after marrying B√©la Szepes on 2 January 1931, she accompanied him to Berlin, where they lived until Hungary's German occupation towards war's end. In her book Magie der Liebe (\\"Magic of Love\\"), Szepes writes about the marriage, which lasted 56 years, and discusses the so-called \\"Alchemistic Marriage\\", the dissolution of the ego in the other. Szepes studied literature, art history, and biology in Berlin. Back in Hungary she first worked as a journalist, screenplay writer, and author. Her first novel The Red Lion was written in a hideout during World War II and became a worldwide bestseller of esoteric literature. The two Raguel volumes are referred to as her chief work by Szepes herself. The Red Lion The Red Lion, M√°ria Szepes' first novel, was published in 1946 in Hungary (original title: A V√∂r√∂s Oroszl√°n). During the communist regime R√°kosi The Red Lion was considered to be nonconformist and therefore was prohibited. All copies of the book were ordered to be destroyed. However, the librarian and novelist B√©la Hamvas managed to save four copies. Then, several supporters of the author typed up the novel, made templates for printing, and released the self-made copies through the underground. Almost 40 years later, the novel arrived at the desk of the Heyne publishing company via the agency Utoprop. The book was translated into German by Gottfried Feidel and was published as a paperback in 1984. More details regarding the history of origin are reported by Hans Joachim Alpers in his preface of the 2002 re-issue. The Red Lion has been adapted to stage and is performed in various theaters of the United States. Plot summary Szepes tells the story of the unhappy Hans Burgner, a miller's son born in the 16th century. After the death of his weak father and of a likewise miserable but beloved teacher, he becomes afraid of the unavoidable death of all living things. Driven by a monomania fed by persistent rumors of an Elixir of Immortality, he becomes an apprentice of a mysterious physician and alchemist. However, instead of listening to the Alchemist's compassionate counsel and warnings, Burgner is driven by feverish greed to murder him; in this way, he acquires the Elixir while he is still spiritually unprepared, and is cursed thereby. This is the starting-point of a journey through the centuries: while Burgner can physically die, the Elixir enables him to retain the full memory of his previous lives as he repeatedly reincarnates into a variety of different circumstances. It also bestows upon him a profound spiritual sensitivity. Several times he attempts the Great Transmutation in order to deliver himself from his self-imposed curse. Hans Burgner is refined through his various incarnations. Against the backdrop of the last five centuries of European history, he undergoes dramatic personal development: beginning as a spiritually unawakened (and even infamous) character, he matures spiritually through the various challenges he is led to confront. He is first an initiate and Aspirant, eventually attaining the perfection of human personality which characterizes the Magus, or spiritual Adept.

In 2016, the municipality had a population of 17,247 inhabitants. History The area of Navalmoral includes remains from the Prehistoric and Roman (villas, bridges, temples etc.) ages. Navalmoral was founded in the late 14th - early 15th century as a communication hub. It became an autonomous commune in the 19th century. Navalmoral belongs to the natural comarca of Campo Ara√±uelo. Communications (roads and bridges) were promoted during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (the finishing of several works would linger a long time, though). Initially endorsed by local farmers, the latter removed their support to the regime after it failed to deliver on its promises, turning away from the dictator and ultimately also from the Monarchy, with the population overwhelmingly voting anti-monarchist candidates in the 1931 municipal elections that installed the Second Republic. La Vera and Guadalupe roads were constructed, as well as other less important roads. In 1930 the Tobacco Fermentation Center (CNCFT) was promoted by locals, boosting the economy of Navalmoral and its comarca. Local anarchists took part of the country-wide . On 21 July 1936, soon after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Navalmoral was seized by the Rebel forces after a swift combat. Started in 1949, the Rosarito's Irrigation Plan had a remarkable impact on Navalmoral's economy and demography, notably it allowed the expansion of cotton and tobacco based local industries. Another public work of the 20th century was the construction of the Valdeca√±as Reservoir, which enabled exploitation of the Tagus river, providing significant new funds for both Navalmoral town and its comarca, and thus helping to slow down the 1960s decline in population. Consequently, new districts and schools were built, available running water improved and thanks to the Ti√©tar river, sewers and other infrastructure improvements were made. After a period of prosperity the economy began to stagnate, but in 1972 work on the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant started, which boosted Navalmoral's population and economy again, even though there had been some local opposition to the project. After the 1979 municipal election, Tom√°s Yuste Mir√≥n (UCD) was confirmed as Mayor of the municipality. Progress continued, thanks to a significant number of public works which enabled Navalmoral to become the main town in the Campo Ara√±uelo. In 2015, Raquel Medina, from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), became the new mayor Culture The main festival is the annual carnival, when for five days every early spring three large parades are held. Economy Navalmoral de la Mata is to be the base of \\"Expacio-Navalmoral\\", a logistical-industrial estate which will process, supply and deliver raw material and goods to major centres such as Madrid.

In mammals, there is normally occurring anti-thrombin activity (antithrombin III), which can be distinguished from autoimmune anti-thrombin. Anti-thrombin antibodies can react with both types of thrombin in the antithrombin-thrombin complex. Antibodies (IgG) against thrombin can strongly inhibit its activity. Inhibitory anti-thrombin antibodies can be divided into 2 groups, those that inhibit coagulation activity and those the inhibit coagulation and amidase activity. Autoimmune anti-thrombin was also found to inhibit the binding of antithrombin III to thrombin. Such activities are more often found with primary biliary cirrhosis. Multiple studies have shown, however, that despite autoimmune anti-thrombin thrombin inhibitory activity, these antibodies correlate with thrombotic events, so that they may also perturb the regulation of coagulatory factors.

The principal source is: SAUCEDILLA: santo y se√±a de un pueblo extreme√±o, by RUBIO MASA, Juan Carlos & RUBIO MASA, Jos√© Luis; Ed. Excmo. Ayuntamiento de Saucedilla, 1994 () is a municipality located in the province of C√°ceres, Extremadura, Spain. According to the 2010 census (INE), it has a population of 859 inhabitants. It belongs to the Campo Ara√±uelo County (Comarca del Campo Ara√±uelo), the capital of which is Navalmoral de la Mata.  Geography and nature  The situation of Saucedilla is impressive. In the north, the vast bulk of the Sierra de Gredos and the Ti√©tar River; in the south and west, the Miravete Sierra (Casas de Miravete), the Tagus River (Tajo in Spanish) and the Serrej√≥n Sierra. The climate is Mediterranean. The village stands in an extensive plain of clayey grounds. Dehesa The municipality is surrounded by immense dehesas. A dehesa is a light wood of holm oaks (Quercus ilex) or cork oaks (Quercus suber). There, the breeding (animal husbandry) of cattle, sheep (for meat and wool), goats (for meat and cheese), and pigs, (Iberian pig) for meat like jam√≥n ib√©rico (Iberian ham) and jam√≥n serrano, are common. The breeding of fighting bulls (toro bravo in Spanish) is also widespread. There are some ganader√≠as of these wild bulls in Saucedilla (Cerro Alto, La Anguila) and others nearby villages like Casatejada or Toril. Arrocampo Reservoir Arrocampo Reservoir was created at 1976 to cool the turbines of the Almaraz nuclear power plant, which is near Saucedilla. With a system of dams and dikes, the water, taken from Tagus river, covers a circuit of 11 km which allow the cooling of these turbines. :* Biomass (ecology): there are a considerable masses of phytoplankton and zooplankton thanks to the eutrophication and oxygenation of waters. The bulrush (Typha latifolia) vegetation is dominant in Arrocampo. It allows the proliferation of birds and little mammals. :* Fishes: barbels (Barbus barbus), common carps (Cyprinus carpio), tenches (Tinca tinca), big largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) (almost 50 cm). :* Actually, it is an important Special Protection Area (SPA) for wild birds. (In Spanish: Zona Especial de Protecci√≥n para las Aves, ZEPA.) Many migrating as well as permanent birds can be watched in the reservoir waters and their vicinity: white stork (Ciconia ciconia), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio). This is, perhaps, the bird symbol of Arrocampo Reservoir SPA). The list is practically endless. :  Ca√±ada Real Leonesa Occidental (main droveway of Western Le√≥n)  Saucedilla was always a land of sheep. (Its coat of arms has a head of ram.) Extremadura (and Saucedilla), was a passing and transhumance land from the Middle Age. In medieval Spain, there were droving flocks of sheep on the largest scale, which were carefully organized by the system of the Mesta, crossing Extremadura and other Spanish regions. These long distance movements of sheep and cattle were made along drovers road called ca√±adas reales in Castile, caba√±eras in Aragon, carreradas in Catalonia. The Ca√±ada Real Leonesa Occidental cross Saucedilla by the south, near the cemetery. There is a country house, close the graveyard, for sheepherds and cowherds who cover the droveway still today. Irrigated lands :* Long ago, the economic activity of Saucedilla was based only on traditional agriculture. During centuries, there was a subsistence farming (dry farming), with also the breeding of sheep, goats, cattle and pigs. This agriculture has produced cereals for years and years in Saucedilla lands: wheat, barley, oats, rye, chickpeas, broad beans and root vegetables like turnips. Also olives and wine. Purple swamphen, a characteristic wild bird of Arrocampo :* The new irrigation farming: the Valdeca√±as Reservoir upon the Tagus (on southeast of the municipality), and the construction of many channels, were made possible to irrigate many farmlands of Saucedilla. Fodder for cows and sheep, fruits like tomatoes, pimientos, bell peppers, peaches, etc., are produced because of the arrival of water in the 1980s.  Special Protection Areas There are two Special Protection Areas (SPAs) in Saucedilla. They were created in 2005. :* Arrocampo Reservoir Special Protection Area. The list of wild birds of Arrocampo Reservoir SPA is really very large.(Arrocampo Reservoir Special Protected Area (eng.)): :* Lesser Kestrel Colonies of Saucedilla Special Protection Area: it is located on the vast bulk of the parish church of Saucedilla. 17 couples of kestrels (Falco naumanni) (cern√≠calos in Spanish) are registered in 2005 in the putlog holes of its walls.

Talayuela's name comes from \\"atalayuela\\", related to the Spanish (Arab origin) word \\"Atalaya\\", which means \\"watch tower\\". Geography Talayuela is located in the north-east part of Extremadura autonomous community, in Ti√©tar river valley, an important tributary of Tagus river, and belongs to Campo Ara√±uelo comarca, next to La Vera comarca. That land is almost a flat valley, with an altitude of 287 meters above sea level. Talayuela owns a large and fertile pine forest, plus a big number of oak forests turned into meadows for human use. Talayuela also owns a number of important ponds, which are used by local animals and migrant birds as a refuge and provisioning base. Demographics Current Talayuela's population are 9.582 people (INE 2007), including people living in neighboring farms. Population has been growing in the last years due to immigrants looking for a better job, so nowadays Talayuela holds people from 22 different countries. Immigrants are a 33% of current Talayuela's population. Economy Talayuela's economy is mainly based on tobacco growing, but in the last years it started to decline as the European Union grants disappeared. Other important growings for Talayuela are asparagus, which provides job for many families as there are two important nearby canning companies, pepper, tomato and corn. As tobacco growing is declining, other alternatives are being developed, like saffron, cotton or coffee growing. Actually, both cotton and coffee were grown before tobacco growings began. Families based in Talayuela, many of them immigrants, live thanks to agriculture. People in Talayuela use to alternate tobacco and asparagus harvest in different parts of the year, so they're rarely unemployed, and some immigrants work on grape and orange harvest in other autonomous communities too. Tobacco growing is so important in Talayuela that it helped many young people to pay for their education, working in summer time and studying in winter time. History Talayuela was founded in the 16th century as an extension of Plasencia town, it was the same century in which the San Mart√≠n church was built, being the most important Talayuela's monument.

Where the mountain got its name is uncertain. It may have come from the Comanche word \\"tukamukaru\\", which means to lie in wait for someone or something to approach. A 1777 burial record mentions a Comanche woman and her child captured in a battle at Cuchuncari, which is believed to be an early version of the name Tucumcari. Pedro Vial referred to the mountain in 1793, while opening a trail between Santa Fe and St. Louis. Captain Randolph B. Marcy led an expedition past it in 1849. The Swiss-American geologist Jules Marcou studied the geology of Tucumcari Mountain in 1853 and claimed that the Tucumcari strata were of Jurassic age. The Texas geologist, Robert T. Hill, visited \\"Mesa Tucumcari\\" in 1887 and again in 1891, and eventually concluded that the Tucumcari strata were much younger Cretaceous deposits, not Jurassic as suggested by Marcou.Hill, Robert T. 1893. Tucumcari. Science 22(545):23-25. Also in 1891, William F. Cummins of the Geological Survey of Texas studied Tucumcari Mountain and his careful observations of the strata established beyond doubt the Cretaceous age of the Tucumcari beds. The town of Tucumcari was founded in 1901 and, in 1908, took its name‚Äîboth in real life and in legend‚Äîfrom the mountain.

Built in 1888, it is the oldest surviving boat from the Great South Bay oyster fleet, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006. and It is berthed near the Modesty, another National Historic Landmark sloop. History On Saturday, April 7, 1888, Elisha Saxton launched his brand new working sloop, Priscilla on the Patchogue River. Saxton had built Priscilla for George Rhinehart of Lawrence, New York, who named the boat for his wife, Priscilla. From 1888 to 1963, Priscilla was owned and operated by several oystermen from Connecticut and New York. During these years, she experienced many changes. The oystermen spoke of \\"Pris\\" as a fast, able and \\"smart\\" boat - a \\"money maker\\" because, unlike other boats, she could dredge well in both light and heavy winds. By 1963, the oyster beds were completely exhausted or covered with silt from storms and hurricanes of the previous decades. Priscilla is one of the last of the New York oyster sloops. From 1963 to 1976, Priscilla became a cruising sailboat after much hull and interior restoration. Her owner, John Woodside, sailed Priscilla several times to the Bahamas and to Maine. In the early 1970s, he schooner-rigged her, copying the sail plan of the famous schooner America. In 1976, John Woodside donated her to the Suffolk Marine Museum, which is known today as The Long Island Maritime Museum. As the largest vessel in the museum's collection, Priscilla has traveled the Great South Bay visiting various ports of call, and has participated in special regattas held for classic vessels. In 1986, she participated in the Parade of Tall Ships at the Salute to the Statue of Liberty Fourth of July Celebration in New York Harbor, receiving featured television coverage by WABC-TV.

The legal basis of the system is the Act on the displays of public recognition (1215/1999) which grants the president the authority to issue decrees on orders, medals and titles. The system is divided into three groups: #orders #medals and decorations #titles Orders There are three Finnish orders: *The Order of the Cross of Liberty, founded in 1918 *The Order of the White Rose of Finland, founded in 1919 *The Order of the Lion of Finland, founded in 1941 The President of Finland is the grand master of all orders. Of the orders, the Order of the Cross of Liberty is the most distinguished and awarded the most seldom. Its decorations are awarded only for military or national defence merits, although the order is not purely military: civilians may receive decorations of the order for national defence merits. The other two orders are awarded both for civilian and military merits. The decorations are awarded twice a year, on 4 June on the Flag Day of the Finnish Defence Forces, and on the Independence day, 6 December. In total, there are about 6.000 awards a year. The orders of the White Rose and the Lion of Finland have a common board and chancellor, while the Order of the Cross of Liberty has a separate board and chancellor. All orders are awarded by the president of Finland. The Order of the Cross of Liberty is always awarded \\"with swords\\" to military persons, with an additional ribbon in rosette form (see image in the beginning of the article) for combat or war-time merits. The decorations of the Order of the White Rose of Finland are awarded \\"with swords\\" only for combat merits and the decorations of the Order of the Lion of Finland only for war-time military merits. As such merits are usually recognised by decorations of the Order of the Cross of Liberty, the awards of the Order of the White Rose of Finland \\"with swords\\" have been vanishingly rare.

Although the decorations are founded by the president, the awarding body is usually the chief of the authority in question, i.e. a minister or a high-level civil servant. Titles Although a republic, Finland has a tradition of awarding titles for distinguished citizens. The available titles are listed in the presidential decree on titles (381/2000). The titles are classified in 16 categories of precedence. The two highest titles are valtioneuvos/statsr√•d (literal translation ) and vuorineuvos/bergsr√•d (literal translation ). The former is usually awarded to most distinguished, retired politicians, while the latter is meant for the CEOs of the largest Finnish companies. Less distinguished titles span different walks of life. Curiosities include liikenneneuvos (), kotiseutuneuvos () and nuorisoasiainneuvos (). In total, there are about 100 different titles. A Finnish title is purely honorary, causing no responsibilities and giving no privileges. All Finnish titles are non- hereditary. Typically, the titles are awarded by the president. There are some exceptions, however. The chief judge of a district court may award the title of herastuomari () to a lay judge with a long service.K√§r√§j√§oikeuslaki (581/1993) The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Finnish Orthodox Church, on the other hand, have the right to award the titles of director cantus and director musices.Kirkkolaki (1054/1993) Laki ortodoksisesta kirkkokunnasta (985/2006) Yearly, the president awards over 200 titles on the advice of the titles' board.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1352 inhabitants. History From the earliest Iberian times, passing through the Celtic, Phoenician, Greek, Carthaginian, Roman, Visigoth and Arab periods, until the middle of the 13th century, Extremadura suffered violent invasions, accusations of displacement of its first inhabitants and successive conquests that led to A state of instability and skepticism that was to be projected into the character of its future inhabitants. In any case, the primitive character was profiling and acquiring strength and identity of its own over the centuries until it was possible to establish a regional idiosyncrasy that has led it to continue to the present day. The prehistoric essence of Lower Extremadura is linked to the various events that have been reported since the first Mediterranean invasions. According to the discoveries of ancient vestiges, it is conjectured that Almendral was populated by primitive tribes of Iberian race, since the territory between this town and Barcarrota, counts on one of the majors concentrations of megalithic tombs [4] of the Province of Badajoz. Possible seat since the Roman period, the Visigoths should have elevated it of superior category, since in its old site, place known like the hermitage of San Mat√≠as, have appeared a series of visigodas pieces of some archaeological value that are currently in the Museum Archaeological site of Badajoz and in the hermitage of Finibus T√©rrae. The present Almendral was founded by the Arabs, two kilometers from the old site of the church of San Mat√≠as, since the previous settlement would have been devastated by Portuguese forces when they ventured into Extremadura after the battle of Aljubarrota . In 1333, King Alfonso XI the Justiciero handed over the town of Almendral, with all its terms and rents, to Enrique Enr√≠quez \\"el Mozo\\" , lord of Villalba de los Barros and Justice mayor of the King's House, who was the great-grandson of Fernando III the Saint, King of Castile and Le√≥n . Almendral was a village of Badajoz and was part of the Manor of Feria in the time of Gome Su√°rez de Figueroa . During the seventeenth century, like the other Extremadura populations near the Portuguese border, Almendral also suffered from the ups and downs of the clashes between the two nations. To the end of Francoist Spain the locality constitutes constitutional municipality in the region of Extremadura . From 1834 was integrated in the Judicial Party of Olivenza . 1 In the census of 1842 it had 480 homes and 1,670 neighbors.

Economy  The economy is based on agriculture, with breeding of pigs, and also goats and sheep, predominating. Pork and pork products such as red sausage, black pudding black and eggs and green ham, cheeses, and vegetable preserves are produced. Chestnuts, acorns, and cork are also produced.  History  View of Cabeza la Vaca In the Iron Age, this region, like all of Extremadura south where is found Cabeza la Vaca, was inhabited by Celtic people known as the Celtici, but on the border with the turduli and turdetanian (tartessian derivaded) in the south east. Throughout the second century B.C, the Roman conquest and carry out settlements in the south of Extremadura displacing the celtics languages around this zone. It‚Äôs possible the region where nowadays is Cabeza la vaca may enjoy a period of prosperity as the Roman road Ruta de Plata v√≠a ( Silver way in English) is close up connecting the south and north of the Iberian Peninsula. Roman coins have been found around Cabeza la Vaca by farmers when plowing the ground. Roma maintained the control through to the 5th century. The end of the Roman rule enabled the visigothic period, which often is regarded as the. In other parts of the Peninsula, this first domain meant a stagnation stage; nevertheless judging by the number of scripts and remains found around the zone and in the same village (reused elements on fountains or columns), this epoch was important for those lands. The Muslim conquest, between 711 and 716, don‚Äôt mean the final of the Christianism. In this mountainous, steep and craggy landscapes had resistors through to the 9th century, then the zone was depopulated, hence the scant remains related to the Muslim and lack of continuity of Cabeza la Vaca with other previous settlement. After the Christian reconquest in the first half of the twelfth century by the Kingdom of Lion and the order of Santiago, around 1230, some huts and cabins, perhaps related to unknown and razed town from the visigothic epoch and survivors of the Muslim domain, were gradually attracting settlers from the North, until the end of century the location was renamed as Cabeza de la Vaca de Le√≥n, so it started out the modern history of the town. The language of lion spread through Extremadura, however the castilian imposed in the 14th century. The proximity of another Spanish kingdom, Portugal, along with civil wars within Castilla y Leon and terrible plagues led to instability through to the 15th century, when Cabeza de la Vaca consolidated firmly. The town was closely linked to the conquest of America and to the Kingdom of Seville from the late 15th century. Among the personages more important the village highlights Diego Mar√≠a de la Tordoya illustrious neighbor Cow Head, born probably in the decade of 1460-1470, was one of the companions of Columbus on the first expedition to the New World, and died there. On the other hand, it finds some movements of population at the Archive of Indies, specially in the 17th century toward New Spain and Peru. The 17th is marked by the collapse of the economic system based on old structures almost medieval, and above all by the conflict with Portugal, which broke the unit of Spain. Whereas, the 18th century was characterized by the growth. A lot of lands around Cabeza la Vaca were used for farming and specially livestock, according as the religious orders lost strength, configuring the current economic model of the village. The confiscations from the 19th intensified this process, but the lands fell into fewer hands. The society of Cabeza la Vaca divided into farmers, owners of properties, and agricultural laborers. This one, coupled with the population growth, caused profound social inequalities. Yet the second half of this century was the relative prosperity, because the agricultural economy shifted gradually from a communal village to a more efficient private farm-based agriculture; nevertheless and on the other hand there were less need for manual labor on the farm, so many went to the cities. In 1905 the town reached over 5,000 inhabitants, but the population then gradually declined. Too many population for a backward economic and especially poorly organized. Since the 1920s appears migration toward the near zones or Badajoz, Seville and Madrid, which intensified from the 1950s to the 1970s, when six in ten people emigrated, also toward other regions like Barcelone or Valencia. Remittances from emigrants became the main source of wealth throughout the century. Another event within the century was the Spanish Civil War. Franco's troops entered with little resistance into a village terrified by the excesses of the republicans such as the confiscation of food or the burning of Churches in nearby towns. But, on the other hand, the 1940s were years of repression too by the Guardia Civil, with rebels in near mountains and crags to Cabeza La Vaca until well into the 1950s. From the 1950s until the end of the Francoism, the village knows the widespread use of electricity at neighbours‚Äô houses, and since the early 1980s the water, inasmuch as people came to the fountains to pick up the water.

According to the 2008 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1,070 inhabitants.  Geography  Location  The municipality is situated on a hill, in a region which has numerous hills and mountains, of which the highest in the province of Badajoz is Tentud√≠a Mount, with 1,104m.  History  During the Arab domination it was called Al-Caxera, meaning white. During the reconquest of Seville by Fernando III, King El Santo instructed the Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, Paio Peres Correia, to attack a Saracen army located in the mountain passes, which led to a decisive victory, which led to the captain shouting \\"Santa Maria stop your day,\\" which has led to a tradition that the sun stood still on the horizon, as in biblical times, to allow Christians the coveted victory. In memory of this miracle the master ordered a temple be built atop the highest mountain, which was elevated to the status of monastery by Pope Leo X in 1514. The construction of this temple, which gave the town large amounts of revenue, led to Calera de Le√≥n becoming one of the most significant towns of the Order of Santiago. Until 1873 Calera de Le√≥n belonged to the diocese of Priory of San Marcos de Leon.  Monuments   St. James Church  St. James Church is constructed of masonry, brick and stone masonry. The facade is quite irregular, showing a volumetric composition where there is a spiral staircase. The nave is covered with a star-shaped vault, resting on pilasters with semicolumns attached. The main entrance of the temple is in Renaissance style, with four Tuscan columns and empty niches between the columns. The altarpiece consists of eight paintings by Eduardo Acosta representing the four evangelists, scenes from the Battle of Tentud√≠a, with the appearance of the Virgin Perez Correa, and the crowning of the equestrian figure of St. James. The niche is occupied by a restored wood carving of the crucified Christ dating from the 17th century. In the windows there are fleurs-de-lis representing the triumph, and the sword of the Order of Santiago. The pulpit, next to the arch, is octagonal with a granite body resting on a fluted basis, supported by a pillar of granite. At the foot of the staircase is a granite basin of holy water. During the stay of the friars of St. Marcos de Leon the church benefited from much furniture and household goods they brought with them.  Tentud√≠a Monastery  The Tentud√≠a Monastery The church was raised on an earlier temple built in commemoration of the legendary battle of Tentud√≠a. It is composed of three buildings, connected by rows of stone arches, with a square chapel in the nave, and smaller ones attached to the side. The enclosure is closed with a simple wooden deck. At the end of the 14th century, two chapels were attached to the head, connected to the side aisles by a small hallway. In front of the altar there is a cartouche with the image of the Virgin and Child. The chapel of St. Augustine in its ceramic altarpiece shows the Holy Father. The main altar, made in 1518, is considered a major part of the monastery, created by the Italian ceramist Niculoso Pisano. The style Pisano uses is Mudejar, and combines the rich harmony of color, being one of the most important ceramic assemblages of the peninsula. Its dimensions are 3.4 m high and 2.65 m wide with a total of 640 tiles. On the right side of the altar with an inscription is the tomb of the founder, Paio Peres Correia, covered with tiles of the same design and style. The Mudejar cloister is simple and built with brick, and consists of a gallery on two floors with four sections overlapping the bottom of four arches, and the top five semicircular openings lowered. In the center is a large capacity tank. On the sides of the gallery there are rooms. Also built was a vestry and gallery, opening portals to communicate the apse with the funeral chapels. Decades later these were replaced with three naves of the church, resulting in a single nave church covered with barrel vault.  Conventual Santiaguista  Conventual Santiaguista The Conventual Santiaguista is a granite and masonry building, made in the late 15th century. It housed the College of San Marcos de Leon for forty years. Like the Monastery of Tentud√≠a, the building was declared to be of National Historic and Artistic Interest in 1931. Its two-storey cloister is built with granite. From 1930 to 1934 this monument was subjected to various attempts at plunder, with the intention of smuggling the artistic stones to America. One of its most important structures is the faculty square, divided into two overlapping stories. The bottom is formed with arches, which rest on pillars with Ionic pilasters and ornamental plots, which closes with cross vaults.  Hermitage of our Lady of Sorrows  The Hermitage of our Lady of Sorrows is designed as a chapel, or shrine, but is deeply modified by successive interventions over the centuries, especially in the Baroque period. It is small in size, with a single nave. There is a dome, the purpose of which was to protect the artistic and liturgical furnishings of the temple from frequent robberies and looting.  Celebrations   Plgrimage of Tentud√≠a  The Pilgrimage of Tentud√≠a is a holiday that has been celebrated every September 8 since the second half of the 13th century and is over 700 years old. In the late 14th century the pilgrimage attendance exceeded more than 6,000 people. According to verified data, it can be said that the pilgrimage or Tentud√≠a fair is one of the oldest in Spain. Every morning on September 8, the image of the Virgin Tentud√≠a goes from the main square of the village, accompanied by countless pilgrims and pilgrims to his shrine, the Monastery of Tentud√≠a, where crowds gather to express their devotion to their patron. Virgin Tentud√≠a is the patron saint of Calera de Le√≥n, and the region of Tentud√≠a.

The fall of the old system of the town, then known as \\"'Campillo\\"', was established in constitutional municipality in the region of Extremadura. It was integrated in the judicial district of Llerena from 1834.

Child we played, cut cane and made mischief; of porters we walked as far as its bridge and sitting on the parapet and the young girls, we talked about forward projects that, now of age, with regrets, we remember. There are no Lakes, but yes lagoons and ponds to remember as of Uncle Hainaut to 1.5 km from the village, on the left side of the road from Peraleda (is now blinded), of the Bujarral in the marriage, of the Commissioner in the Egyptian vultures, of the Guapero in the child of the Garbanzuelo, the eldest of the Raposo. The supply of water to the population, until last century, was carried out by natural sources and wells. Always are known sources of the path of Llerena and the Palace, close to the population; distant, but appreciated water wells are: of the Machicas and Nino. Other non drinking water wells are currently used as the source of the cure in the street of the same name, Manant√≠o, in the light and the Rodeo. This, at present, is within the building that is being built to House of culture. At the end of the Pocico Street on your left side, had a well with steps to make the water more easily. Then he was blinded and instead made a small garden. In 1836, D. Felix Juan Garrido (priest, native of La Granja de San Ildefonso (province of Segovia), won by opposition of the plaza de Campillo parish priest). In the Alb√°nchez towers of the province of Ja√©n, of the Priory of Ucl√©s, he took possession on April 1, 1836, good Friday, and left her in 1841.), cured P√°rroco, the political head of Llerena, complained \\"of her she decided to neighbors and the apathy of the city, they have a well little healthy and impure water, where the boys throw nasties and dead animals and people draw water with all kinds of vessels \\"suffering from inflammation of the spleen, obstructions, placenta and flank pain. ¬´Could build a casket covered by putting a few streams with a pillar that they drink the beasts that currently lacks.\\" Following this complaint, many years later built a pillar that you gave name to the street where he became, with two pipes and drinking trough for animals, where is the source in the D√≠az Ambrona Street before Street pillar, whose waters from a spring in the fence owned by Eduardo Romero at the exit for Azuaga. The path of the Toriles is a well of the bomb, by having a manual pump in a casket for the registration of the conveyance of water to the pillar. About the year 1926 was built another pillar trough, finding in active at the end of the street Castej√≥n, pouring water from a covered spring, according to tradition is an Arab cistern which lies at the end of the Solana Street and beginning of the path of Llerena. During the administration of Mayor D. Antonio Fern√°ndez Otero (D. Antonio Fern√°ndez Otero was Mayor for many years, and during his tenure began the paving of the streets, and built the barracks, cemetery, sewage waste and the Civic Center among others.) the year 1954, opened four deep wells with the stream of the Prado on the hunger site, to 5,33 km, settling seven public fountains by the people, which was held and celebrated with great joy, starting the entry of water into homes. In the 1960s, motivated by the poverty of the springs, by prolonged droughts and the increase in consumption, the veneros were very depleted, creating the need for new springs. After laborious efforts and search for new possibilities, the experts are decided by the construction of a dam in the Guad√°mez River, 4 km away, close to the bridge on the road of Retamal. The dam was inaugurated in 1977, but through lack of foresight or expertise, the water has failed to supply. First was because actual fecal water in the swamp, being normal rejection of population to consume the water in these conditions. Once corrected this problem, clorar the waters they took a dark color that was apparently due to the terrain where the reservoir is very rusty. Thus they were forced to build a new sewage treatment plant at the site of the valleys to bring water to a new process and try to make it fit for consumption. The different chemicals that have tried have failed or at least do not succeed at a social cost. Owner in the effort, the swamp, with all the millions invested in its construction, only serves to satisfy the fans of a fisherman or for nesting waterfowl. Before the pressing need to find as basic element, such as water, five holes in the same place where are the old wells that for many years supplied the people were given, but the results were negative. On the initiative of Agust√≠n Izquierdo Sanchez, natural forests Helechosa and resident of this village, thanks to faith and tenacity, and many people believed was stubbornness and ignorance, performed new drills close to the previous ones, but on the opposite side of the stream of the prado, exposing a good source of water quality through a short pipe is pumped up the old facilities at a minimal costbeing the water consumed, covering needs, from August 9, 1981. To Mr Izquierdo, later was feted with a well-deserved tribute. Negotiating are currently with other nearby villages to bring water from the River Z√∫jar. In 2007, most of the water consumed in Campillo de Llerena is supplied from the reservoir of la Serena, brings to some tanks installed in the farm the valleys, and from there it is distributed to the population. Urban topography The houses are Andalusian whitewashed usually whitewashed fa√ßades with balconies and iron Windows and roofs to two aspects of regular inclination or rifan type. They consist of two floors, the lower used as housing and of above called 'doblao', was used to save the tools of farmhouse or barn. Currently, they are becoming homes. These houses were formerly stables for the horses, or the partly rear or attached to one side of the housing. Currently they are not necessary and they are becoming garage or warehouse. Economy Stop population is often a result of the progress of the economy of the area that is settled, and it depends in turn of existing natural resources, structural policy, and the own-initiative of the people, i.e., is a process in a circle that can be opened by those with decision- making power. The important thing is to know which is the current situation in each sector, glimpse the needs of certain goods and services, to try to take advantage of market gaps. The productive structure of Campillo responds to the schema of an area with a medium-low development level. It is characterized by the high weight of trade to the minor, and a considerable importance of construction and auxiliary companies because, in recent years, being key drivers for the creation of employment in the locality. Agriculture A municipality as Campillo, located in a mainly agricultural and livestock, could not have a significant primary sector in its economy. The abundant grazing has allow also the development of an important cottage of the pig (52.3%) and something less than sheep (35.4%). Most of the rural area is dedicated to pastures (29.6%), still well below the number of cultivated land. Crops include oats (17.6%) in rainfed and irrigated oilseed rape (46.2%) and the Sunflower (40%). The land is usually distributed in holdings (46.7 per cent of farms are under 5 hectares). Most common tenure regimes are the direct exploitation of the land by the owner (68.7 enumerated surface). Holders are mostly elderly between 55 and 65 (33.6 per cent) and being his main occupation only in exploitation (58.7%). Another aspect important to take into account when concluding what the State and prospects for the sector is the level of mechanization, which del Campillo is optimal. Services The majority of companies that can fit in this sector are related to the primary needs and leisure satisfaction. Thus, firstly appear dedicated to trade to the retail non-food products, followed by the food. On the other hand, within the sector services have mentioned the catering trade, in the section on restaurants, bars and hotels there are 13 in number. There is a group of 8 professionals that offer their services independently, classifying them into the category of professional activities (commercial agents, medical, veterinary, lawyers) Construction Mentioning the strong weight of construction firms: 20 autonomous in its majority, to which they do interact with other industries and the auxiliary construction-related leads us to conclude by saying that it is this sector that supports a large weight of all the industrial fabric of the town. It is detected in the last three years in the construction sector declined although slowed down a bit in the last year by the regional policy of encouraging her construction or repair of houses. However the wisdom of experts anticipated that construction will grow less in 1999 in the next two years. \\"Total vehicles registered: 745.\\" In the past three years, the total number of vehicles registered in Campillo de Llerena has grown by more than 10%, namely an 11.9 per cent. This fact called attention due to the large number of vehicles in relation to the population, since we can say that there is an average of 1.2 cars per family, which contrasts with the high percentage of unemployed people may be thinking that there are other \\"submerged\\" income generating additional income, or who have exploited the good employment prospects added to lower rates of interest on loans.

There is no accord about the origins of the name of Castilblanco, but it is known that it is related to an ancient castle located where the San Crist√≥bal church is located nowadays. It is not known who built the castle. They could have been Arabs or Christians in the beginnings of 12th century, during the Reconquista. Many historians argue both that Castilblanco was a Templar enclave and that it would have been known as castillo blanco (white castle) or castillo de los blancos because of the colour of the robe that the Templars wore.Andando por Castilblanco: Historia  Symbols  The official symbol of Castilblanco is its coat of arms. Within it there are represented a castle -in memory of the town's origins- an oak and olive -the most common trees in the surroundings-, the villa declaration -by which Castilblanco got sovereignty in 1554- and a rock-rose flower, in memory of the comarca of La Jara (The Rock-Rose), to which Castilblanco belonged until its incorporation to the province of Badajoz after the fall of the Old Regime. The coat of arms was approved by a decree of the Extremadura Government in 1986, and it is officially described as follows: Physical geography Location The municipality is located within the comarca of La Siberia, which borders with the provinces of C√°ceres, Ciudad Real and Toledo. The town is built on a hill southern the Guadalupe Range -which belongs to the Toledo Mountains- and between the Guadiana and Guadalupe rivers. The town belongs to the judicial district of Herrera del Duque. Orography The urban area is located on a hill which rises above the surroundings countryside. The northern area of the municipality consists of a wide ra√±a soil, undermined by narrow valleys with north-south orientation. These valleys are formed by the streams which flow north. These empty into both the Guadiana and Guadalupe rivers. The eastern area of the municipality has the most irregular relief, while both the western and southern countryside consists generally of fields with gentle slopes. At the boundaries of the municipality are located several ranges which are visible from the urban centre. These ranges belong to the Toledo Mountains, which surround the town on the northern, eastern and southern sides. The ranges located north of the municipality are highest in altitude. Amongst these the highest are the Guadalupe Range, the Altamira Range and the Villuercas Range. The latter reaches 1600 meters. The land extending to the east is very irregular although it is of lower altitudes (around 700 meters at its highest points). In this area there highlight some ranges like Rinconada Range, Palomera Range and Umbr√≠a Range. The southern boundary of the municipality, where both the Guadiana and Guadalupe rivers converge, is also a mountainous terrain bounded by the ranges of Barbas de Oro, Pastillos, Chimenea, Escorial, Villares y Golondrinos. All these ranges are of similar altitudes as those to the east. History In April 1556 Castilblanco was granted the formal title of Villa (town) by King Carlos I, at the request of the Archbishop of Toledo. The population at that time totaled 296 households. Castilblanco had previously been considered an extension of neighboring Talavera. In December 1931, eight months after the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, Castilblanco was the scene of a violent and unexpected incident. At the time it was a pueblo (village) of about 900 reasonably prosperous inhabitants and had no record of political or social unrest. Permission was however refused by the authorities when local socialist leaders proposed a demonstration (the second of two) against the civil governor of Badajoz. The socialist rally went ahead and the Civil Guard detachment based in the village intervened to disperse it at the instructions of the mayor of the municipality. A crowd of villagers confronted the civil guards who, as elsewhere in rural Spain, were resented as an unpopular and repressive force deliberately recruited from outside the region where they were stationed. After a shot was fired, the four civil guards present were knifed to death and their bodies mutilated. It was not possible to identify the actual killers, although six villagers were subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.Hugh Thomas, pages 74-75 \\"The Spanish Civil War\\", Penguin Books 2003 The incident was the first of a series of disturbances that led up to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

According to the 2005 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1023 inhabitants.  Status  It is situated in the foothills of the Sierra de San Pedro, surrounded by meadows and olive groves, which provide the main means of work and economy to the people of Cordobilla. The township borders the province of C√°ceres and M√©rida term. Belongs to the region of Tierra de M√©rida - Vegas Low and judicial Party Montijo. Part of the Commonwealth of Northern L√°cara, comprising stocks Carmonita, La Nava de Santiago, La Roca de la Sierra, Puebla de Obando y Cordobilla of L√°cara. Dista 44 km from M√©rida. The nearest towns are La Nava de Santiago Carmonita 12 km and 9 km.  Geography  Cordobilla of L√°cara sits on the right margin L√°cara River, a tributary of the Guadiana River. Being in a valley located in the municipality access is always from higher areas. It is the geographical unity of the Sierra de San Pedro, Sierra de Mont√°nchez, both belonging to the Los Montes de Toledo. This causes the surrounding territory is exponent of the Mediterranean forest, rich oak, cork trees, thickets, and scrub typical of the meadows. To the south runs the river L√°cara between fertile lands, pastures, olive groves and pastures. The north will make up the foothills of the Sierra de San Pedro, an area of great beauty and difficult access. And to the east and west are pastures with oak trees between plains and mountains. This environment allows an ecosystem rich in fauna and flora, diversified since the emergence of the wetlands, adding new natural and plant species that never existed before because of its dependence on water. Western climate is very strong, with high temperatures in summer and plenty of water and low temperatures in autumn and winter. This marks a changing landscape throughout the year. Abound in these large pastures mediente exploited game species like deer and wild boar and other protected natural habitat found here such as black vultures, golden eagles and imperial Iberian. Except for the areas near the river, the land is unproductive, mostly clay, which does not allow intensive cultivation agriculture. [Edit] Economy  Economy  Agriculture is the main means of livelihood. Focuses on livestock sheep, goats and pigs. Agricultural production is mainly based on olive oil extracted from their olive groves, cereals and exploitation of pastures. Oil production revolves around the borders of the Country Co-operative Society \\"The L√°cara\\", which brings together the vast majority of oil producers in the town, mostly olive smallholders. The oil produced is of high quality, prestigious awards worldwide. So it has been awarded as the best organic oil virgin Extremadura and has been third and best organic virgin olive oil cooperatives in Spain in competition held in Cordoba. Most of the production of olives that are then transformed into acit Verdial belong to the variety, which gives oil trade name \\"Verdial L√°cara.\\" Another major area economic activity is \\"out of Cork\\" which takes place in the summer. Cork is produced by the numerous oaks of the Mediterranean forest parkland of L√°cara Cordobilla bathe. In the summer months the bag is made of cork, which is \\"stripping\\" the tree of your siding, the bark of the cork oak is pure. After their manufacture has many applications, one of the main ones cork for bottling wine. The \\"sacaores\\" (terminology of Extremadura) are people with a high degree of specialization in this work, and that requires great skill, strength and expertise, and higher level is reached after years of learning. He is currently a work in disuse in the rest of Spain, so that \\"sacaores\\" Extremadura, and many of the region of Cordobilla of L√°cara out on the dates indicated to give their services across the geography of the Iberian Peninsula. Extremadura is the leading producer of cork in Spain because it is the region with the Mediterranean forest area in Europe. The main producer in the Portugal international. The activity in industrial and tertiary sectors is minimal, although they represent a growing number in the population of the town.  Etymology  The etymological origin of L√°cara Cordobilla from Arabic, in association with the first settlements before the victory. His name is associated with the city of C√≥rdoba, as the nearest town (Carmonita to 11 miles away. Later it was conquered by the Order of Santiago, and became a dependency of M√©rida, a city near you. Assuming birth to the Muslim way of the Iberian Peninsula, would be under the mandate of the capital (current Badajoz) whose first caliph was Ibn Marwan al-Chilliqui. In this first time the caliphate was very independent of Cordoba, which became part years later. After the disintegration of the Caliphate, capital of Badajoz was one of the largest taifas Peninsula (independent to 1022), the Taifa of Badajoz, playing an important role as a cultural center at the time, mainly during aftas√≠es government. The town sits beside the River L√°cara, hence the name of the town, a tributary of the Guadiana River. For years the prevailing idea that Cordovilla written with V because it was thought that the etymology came from Cordo and Villa. It is still difficult to know what the real etymology, and in recent times is believed more closely related to the Arab and Andalusian city of Cordoba. Although no documents or research to prove either theory.  History  In the fall of the ancien regime is constituted Cordobilla constitutional municipality in the region of Extremadura. From 1834 became part of the judicial district of M√©rida. [1] In the 1842 census had 99 households and 340 residents. [2  Heritage   Dolmen  Near Cordobilla is the Dolmen of L√°cara, an important megalithic construction, which could be the biggest in Europe that is known of its time. L√°cara dolmen is one of the largest and most beautiful you can see in Extremadura. It is preserved in acceptable condition, and viewing it, one can appreciate how this construction method was used for thousands of years. The L√°cara dolmen is a passage grave, an architectural jewel of the Paleolithic. It is situated in the middle of a pasture, among oaks, a few km from M√©rida on the road from Aljuc√©n to La Nava de Santiago. The dolmen consists of a long covered walkway that leads to the burial chamber. This chamber is the dolmen's focus. Of the great stones that rose into the sky (the dome would be about 5 meters) there is only one intact, which gives an idea of the grandeur of the building. The remaining base demonstrates the precision with which the other stones were placed. The dome was closed on top with a slab, which is no longer in evidence. The entire structure was covered with earth and stones, forming a large mound. To strengthen and secure the tomb, large rocks were placed at the base, as a buttress along the outer ring. These stones are visible on the perimeter of the dolmen.  Traditional architecture  The houses have traditionally been whitewashed Extremadura being a typical landscape from white and red Arabic-style tile. Traditional architecture is related to the environment and climate of the area, dry and hot in summer and cold and wet in winter and autumn. Just as the subsistence economy of the time. The typical houses are built around a hallway, usually paved for the passage of cattle to the yard or patio. Rooms are located to sleep on both sides of the aisle if they are whole houses or just one side if you are average. Widen the corridor just in a space dedicated to the kitchen and day room lit by the adjacent patio. In this room the main element is the Spanish fireplace around which life flowed. In the latter part of the house lies the patio or yard (\\"Run\\" in popular terminology) which could also accommodate cattle estancias. Overnight stays no natural light except those facing the street. The smaller homes have only one plant and some bent at its top, which was once for the storage of fodder and feed for livestock. Only a few typical buildings exceed two storeys with habitable floor in the first floor. In addition we find a middle ground space for other uses such as warehouses, barns and stables, and some residences with kitchens not contiguous to the main dwelling, but the courtyard surroundings. Many homes have two entrances, one main vivideras areas and a secondary (known as \\"door\\") to the backyard, stable or barn, often in different streets, and many others in the same. The construction methodology is based on bearing walls of stone and adobe, with vertical holes in the facade, these walls are often shared party walls between adjoining dwellings. The walls are white, using traditional methods of lime. In general, the architecture is devoid of frills beyond certain gaps racks. The gaps are always traditional vertical proportions, even when small in size for reasons of privacy. Traditional roofing tiles are baked red clay. Urbanistically lacks any plan for growth given the age of the first settlements. So originally the town grew up around the church and continued in a broad street parallel to the river L√°cara. The housing plan unequal forms mingle with pens and building spaces as a patchwork tapestry. Note the good preservation of gates and grids that provide a traditional character to the urban. Still preserved wells and batteries that once Water Supplies neighbors and Cordobilla cattle. Highlights the Power of Madro√±al.  Church of St. Peter  The church of St. Peter the Apostle, in the Archdiocese of M√©rida-Badajoz. [3] Located in the town square, the 15th century, subsequently subjected to many changes, the last few years ago. It consists of nave with square head with dome. Its contents include an invoice archaic carving representing San Juan Bautista, datable in the 16th century. Also highlight the wood carvings of San Justo y San Pastor (The Santitos) of S. XVI, recently restored, which since its development in this century have not left the village church in any way to the construction in the 1960s of the chapel, which leads them on the first Sunday of May in the procession to offer mass. Currently in the parish church after restoration.  Ermita de San Justo y San Pastor  The newly built chapel, is situated right on the edge of the provinces of C√°ceres and Badajoz, in the Cerro El Santo in the private property of Square-El Santo. Built in 1965, the chapel was projected to average about lack of money. In the foothills of the hill on which it sits is made the pilgrimage in honor of the patron (The Santitos) the first Sunday in May since its construction in 1965 with the explicit permission of the owners of the farm. At the start made the pilgrimage to the mid-60's after the construction of the chapel was left to celebrate the traditional \\"Compadre Thursday, the party gradually being replaced by the celebration of the new pilgrimage. You can access it only that day to celebrate the Holy Mass in honor of San Justo y San Pastor prior to the festival of the pilgrimage. The church of San Justo y San Pastor lacks any historical value due to its recent construction in 1965, and its poor architecture is superseded by the beautiful surroundings in which they settle. At the foot of Cerro del Santo (who share the private estates of El Castillo de Castellanos (CC) and The Saint, The Square (BA)) and on which the building stands, is the reservoir Oven Tejero, which enriches the landscape, flora and fauna of the meadow that surrounds it. The chapel is the factory of stones and mortar, square and hip roof of red clay tiles. Closed for almost complete, in the west wall opens a big hole with iron gate in the north and south sides only a few small circular windows. In their access (West) also covers stone and mortar slab bounded on the north by a factory that culminates in a small bell tower with no access. To access this new building on top of the hill among rocks and thickets the owners of the El Cuadrao \\"The Holy blazed a new path through the undergrowth in a private capacity, but allows the pilgrims and faithful on the first Sunday in May each year to access the new chapel to celebrate Mass in honor of the child martyrs, prior to the pilgrimage which takes place on that farm.  Demographics  Today the population is of 1,009 inhabitants, although in the past, prior to emigration were rural Extremadura in the 1960s, was over 2,000.

These reservoirs, Embalse de Horno Tejero and Embalse del Boquer√≥n, opened in 1985. These projects have changed the original landscape; they appear as two large lakes in the midst of the pastures nearby. The reservoirs provide water to the Commonwealth of the Northern L√°cara, of which L√°cara Cordobilla is a part. They are not navigable and bathing is prohibited. The main fish are carp, pike and black bass. Both reservoirs, despite their proximity to Cordobilla de L√°cara, also cross the city limits of the towns of M√©rida and Caceres. The reservoirs of Horno Tejero and Boqueron have contributed to the emergence of new flora and fauna that was not native to the area, thus enriching the abundant natural variety that already existed prior to construction of the dams. They have also encouraged new activities in the area such as fishing and hiking.

Born in a bad time for the production and marketing of oil in the area and as a solution to this problem a small group of growers in the town decides to buy one of the old mills, many who came to work simultaneously in the town, and become Cooperative Society Limited in Campo. With time and the momentum of these brave pioneers, all local oil producers are integrated in the Cooperative \\"The L√°cara.\\" Today its membership is around 300, which means that the cooperative is an institution and economic center in the population, since almost all the families cordobillanas direct or indirect relationship with the production, harvesting of olives and production oil. The entire production area is collected in the mill of the cooperative. All members are required to keep their production of olives to the mill of the cooperative and assign a proportion of their production to the cooperative for funding, maintenance and modernization. This contribution, in proportion to each partner in terms of what it produces and not fixed, is the Capital of the cooperative. Suguna contributed by each social capital than they have in society is different for each partner what he has made during his years as a member of the cooperative. The Social Capital is what has allowed the modernization of the means of transformation of the olive oil. Currently the conversion is done by means of modern amenities.

This variety is very resistant to drought and high humidity do not need to mature, which runs from mid November to late December, so it is perfectly adapted to the terrain and continental climate of the province of Badajoz. Fruits are long and highly variable oil content but high in the zone of L√°cara Cordobilla reaching 22%. The ning her meat-bone is also high, which makes the olives may be used for table consumption or for processing alamazara oil. The oils from the olive variety Verdial are sweet and fruity, and the fact that they are organic production and flight (never land with olives) make Verdial L√°cara oil does not exceed 0.2 degrees of acidity, with and Extra Virgin. Oil production is one of the major sectors in the economy of the town due to the large expanse of olive groves in the south of the municipality. Currently 100% of oil production is from farming and are distinguished only two types: Olive Oil Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Green. The olive harvest traditionally begins in mid December, at which time the mill opens its doors to the back of the product and begins to run conversion using modern oil-based media in a continuous system of two phases. Gone are the old ways of grinding rollers and hydraulic presses that started with the small group of founders of the Cooperativa del Campo \\"The L√°cara\\" mid 1980s to buy an old mill obsolete. In mid-January, according to the volume of harvest, are beginning to become the first ecological liters of oil. Depending on the year, the mill usually collect one million pounds of olives in a normal harvest, reaching and surpassing the two million kilograms in bumper crops, such as the recent of the years 2009 and 2010. The cooperative L√°cara Extremadura and organic production to ensure strict adherence to production and harvesting of olives. The daily recogidia is placed in the mill at the same time, distinguishing the ground and the flight to ensure quality and achieve the minimum of acidity in the finished product. Olive Oil Organic Extra Virgin \\"Verdiial L√°cara\\" is considered one of the world's best in their field and therefore guarantee it received international awards in recent years: \\\\- First Prize for Extra Virgin Olive Oil from organic cultivation of Extremadura, the endpoint 2002. \\\\- Third Prize at the First National Extra Virgin Olive Oil from organic cultivation of the Seventh Exhibition of Ecological Agriculture, held in C√≥rdoba in 2002. \\\\- Winner of the best organic oils in the world BIOFACH 2010, most important fair in the sector of organic products in Europe and one of the most important in the world that is held annually in the German city of Nuremberg.

Today major industries include cork extraction and the processing of pork from Iberian pigs. Tourism is also increasing in importance. History In the vicinity of the present town lie the ruins (almost entirely buried and little-researched) of a Celtic fort called Nert√≥briga, which became known as Nert√≥briga-Concordia Iulia after the Roman conquest. This city was part of the Hispania Ulterior region in the first two centuries BC; later it became part of Hispania Baetica, where it remained for over seven centuries until the beginning of the Muslim conquest. New research in this city has uncovered a watchtower first used by the Visigoths and later by Muslims, and a Muslim cemetery. The only reference made by Christians about this city is the name Castillo de Valera, which was dated by the Knights Templar. The city was conquered by Fernando III with the help of the Templars, but first appearance of Fregenal in historical records was in 1283 when the population was given by Alfonso X of Castile to the Order of the Temple for its work in the reconquista. Fregenal ultimately was returned to the kingdom of Seville in 1312.

According to the 2005 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 3,840 inhabitants.  History  The first human settlements in the mountain range of Hornachos are dated from prehistoric times as shown by the cave paintings in the quartzite rocks. These paintings were made between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, around 2,000-3,000 BCE. The city was occupied during the Roman period and it was then when it received the name of Fornacis due to the iron mines and where the name 'Hornachos' ultimately derives. Archaeological evidence (Hornachuelos Oppidum) shows that the site had certain importance in Emerita Augusta during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. During the Visigoths' time the tradition sets Hornachos as the refugee of Saint Hermenegild when escaping from his father, King Leovigild. The defensive fortress crowning the village was built during the Al-Andalus period. In 1234 Hornachos was occupied by the Order of Santiago, as a land grant by Ferdinand III of Castile,Historia de Espa√±a, Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Tomo XIII, Castilla y Le√≥n (1217-1349) p. 50, Espasa-Calpe, Madrid 1990 However, this was not originally a cause of concern for the majority Muslim -then Morisco after 1502- population. Nevertheless, at the end of the 16th century the village was surrounded by a wall and there were more than 10,000 inhabitants, being the most important Morisco centre in Spain. The Spanish captain Alonso de Contreras narrates in his memoir how he found a stash of arms stored by some Moriscos, and years later was accused of planning a revolt with said Moriscos. On April 9, 1609, King Philip III of Spain decreed the expulsion of the Moriscos. The village underwent a period of decline. These moriscos refugees settled in Morocco, near Bou Regreg and Sal√© (modern-day Rabat), and went on to create a small independent maritime republic, known as the Republic of Bou Regreg or Republic of Sal√©, which was a haven for corsair activity in the region. Nowadays the village keeps the heritage from the past in its steep streets following the Moorish building schemes as it is shown in places as Ribera, San Francisco, Chamorro,Pe√±a, Enfermer√≠a o Plata, Tellada, Larga, Gata, Nogueras, etc.  Sites of Interest  The most characteristic and outstanding site of Hornachos is its castle built on the top of the hill by the berbers in the 9th century and whose remains observe the daily life of the hornachegos. Other of the most relevant monuments of Hornachos is the Church of the Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, a Mudejar work which stands as a unique example in the region and which has been recently declared Monument of Historical and Artistic Interest in Extremadura.  Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n Church  The building is characterised by the use of brick as the main material and the dominant geometrical character, distinctly Islamic, emerged conspicuously in the accessory crafts using cheap materials elaborately worked‚Äîtilework, brickwork, wood carving, plaster carving, and ornamental metals. The tiling patterns stand out as the Ferdinand and Isabella coat of arms. The church tower has 24 spaces, 6 in each side.  Other landmarks  Other landmarks include the Franciscan Convent of San Ildefonso, founded in 1526 by Charles I of Spain, and which keeps a rich set of altarpieces, paintings and sculptures. In its facade, nowadays very damaged, still displays the original imperial coat of arms of Charles I. An important site is the Church of the Remedios, built in XVI and remodeled in 1892, surrounded by a square covered by palm trees and where the festivities of September are celebrated. Very relevant within the Hornachos' monuments are its traditional fountains as Los Moros, Los Cristianos, Palomas, Cuatro Ca√±os, Ribera, San Francisco, Almagrera, Maxicaco, San Roque, Santa, Nueva, etc. El P√≥sito, situated in the outskirts of the village, was used by the moriscos as a mosque and it has been recently restored.  Geography: Flora and Fauna  The Hornachos mountain range constitutes the southerner mountains of the Central Sierras of Badajoz. The most important formations are the Sierra Grande and the Sierra de los Pinos with a maximum height of 951 m in the Hornachos Hill. The main rivers which flow along the area are the Palomillas river and the Matachel . The most characteristic elements of the landscape is the dehesa or meadow of holm-oaks and cork oaks. The rest has a Mediterranean vegetation, characterized by drought-resistant plants, commonly reduced to scrub status (matorral). Some common plants are also the retama sphaerocarpa, the genista hirsuta, the erica australis and the narrow-leaved cistus. Dehesa In the highest part of the Sierra the Juniperus oxycedrus appears with great splendor. There are more than 600 ha. inside the protected area ZEC-ZEPA. Within this area a curious plant, the Erodium mouretii, grows being an endemic species only present in some spots of Extremadura, Andalusia and Northern Morocco. Sierra The Sierra is the ideal setting for plentiful animal life, being outstanding the great variety of birds of prey. Within the ZEC-ZEPA area more than 228 different species have been found, a high number if we take into account the limited zone (12,000 ha). The Spanish imperial eagle and other large birds such as the vulture, the eagle owl, the buzzard, the falcon, the kite are native of these mountains. During autumn and winter the Sierra also becomes the shelter for migrant birds such as the European robin or the pyrrhula. The association ADENEX is responsible for a Natural Reserve and research centre in this location. Finally another appealing natural spot is the reservoir of Los Molinos.  Feast And Traditions  Most of the festivities which take place in Hornachos have their origin in religious traditions. One of the most important is the Candelas, celebrated on 2 February. The inhabitants gather around huge bonfires, where is thought that all the evil spirits and the previous bad experiences are burnt. In February Hornachos celebrates the carnival, the merrymaking and festivity that takes place in the last days and hours before the Lenten season. Home-made and elaborate costumes, parades, parties and various other festivities mark such celebration. The Holy Week, the week between Palm Sunday and Easter, is observed with special solemnity as a time of devotion to the passion of Jesus Christ beginning with the traditional blessing and procession of palms and olive branches. The end of celebration is on Easter Sunday when the traditional white cakes are blessed. On 15 May, San Isidro, Hornachos begins a traditional feast where all the inhabitants share a nice country day to eat and drink with their neighbours. The religious festivity of San Juan is celebrated on 24 June, where the Night of the Fire- the Night of the Water takes place. People wet their heads in the San Francisco basin, with the belief that they will not suffer headaches until the following year. In the middle of August, the Emigrant feast is held dedicated to the ones who had to abandon their village and who usually return on this date. However the most important festivity begins 8 September, Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios, patroness of Hornachos, where the whole village organizes parties, shows and encierros (\\"enclosing\\") of the bulls, when they are driven through the streets behind crowds of skillfully dodging men and boys.

Spanning from the late 1930s into World War II, this historical novel dramatizes anti- fascist resistance and the rise and fall of proletarian political parties in Europe. Living in Berlin in 1937, the unnamed narrator and his peers, sixteen and seventeen-year-old working-class students, seek ways to express their hatred for the Nazi regime. They meet in museums and galleries, and in their discussions they explore the affinity between political resistance and art, the connection at the heart of Weiss's novel. Weiss suggests that meaning lies in the refusal to renounce resistance, no matter how intense the oppression, and that it is in art that new models of political action and social understanding are to be found. The novel includes extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature. Moving from the Berlin underground to the front lines of the Spanish Civil War and on to other parts of Europe, the story teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures. The three volumes of the novel were originally published in 1975, 1978 and 1981.  Plot  Weiss's complex multi-layered 1000 page novel has been called a \\"book of the century [Jahrhundertbuch].\\"Wolfgang Fritz Haug and Kaspar Maase, \\"Vorwort.\\" Materialistische Kulturtheorie und Alltagskultur. Haug/Maase (eds.). Argument Verlag, 1980, p. 4. It can no more be usefully summarized than James Joyce's Ulysses. By way of introducing The Aesthetics of Resistance what follows are the opening paragraphs of an article by Robert Cohen: \\"The Aesthetics of Resistance begins with an absence. Missing is Heracles, the great hero of Greek mythology. The space he once occupied in the enormous stone frieze depicting the battle of the Giants against the Gods is empty. Some two thousand years ago the frieze covered the outer walls of the temple of Pergamon in Asia Minor. In the last third of the nineteenth century the remnants of the ancient monument were discovered by the German engineer Carl Humann and sent to Germany. The fragments were reassembled in the specially built Pergamon Museum in Berlin, the capital of Wilhelminian Germany, and were to signal from this point forward the late claims to power of German imperialism. The Pergamon frieze can still be seen in Berlin today. In the fall of 1937 ‚Äì and here we are at the beginning of Peter Weiss's novel ‚Äì three young men find themselves before the frieze. Two of them, Coppi and the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, are workers. The third, a sixteen-year-old named Heilmann, is a high school student. Coppi is a member of the illegal Communist Party, Heilmann and the narrator are sympathizers. All three are active in the antifascist resistance. In a lengthy discussion the three friends attempt to interpret the stone figures and events depicted in the frieze in a way which would make them relevant for their own present day struggle. They cannot, however, find Heracles. Other than a fragment of his name and the paw of a lion's skin, nothing remains of the leader of the Gods in the battle against the Giants. The \\"leader\\" of 1937, on the other hand, is an omnipresent force, even in the still halls of the Pergamon Museum, where uniformed SS troopers, their Nazi insignia clearly visible, mingle among the museum's visitors. Under the pressure of the present and with their lives in constant danger, the three young antifascists read the empty space in the frieze as an omen, they feel encouraged to fill it with their own representation of the absent half-god. What they envision is an alternative myth in stark contrast to the traditional image of Heracles. From a friend of the Gods, the mighty and the powerful, Heracles is transformed into a champion of the lowest classes, of the exploited, imprisoned, and tortured ‚Äì a messianic \\"leader\\" in the struggle against the terror of the \\"F√ºhrer\\". The concept of a messianic bearer of hope is by no means unique in Weiss's work. Starting with the coachman in the experimental novel The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman (1952/1959), messianic figures appear repeatedly in Weiss's literary work. That Weiss would continue to be obsessed with such figures after he turned to Marxism in 1964/1965 may seem surprising. However, the concept now becomes increasingly secularized, as for example in the figure of Empedocles in the play H√∂lderlin (1971). In The Aesthetics of Resistance this process of secularization is brought to its logical conclusion. Before they reach this conclusion, however, readers of Weiss's novel are confronted with nearly a thousand pages of text interrupted only occasionally by a paragraph break ‚Äì a sea of words which resists any attempt at summarizing. Even to characterize The Aesthetics of Resistance as an antifascist novel seems to unduly narrow the scope of Weiss's broad project. There is no clearly defined geographical or historical space within which events unfold. There is no unifying plot, and neither is there a chronological structure to the narrative. The novel presents a history of the European Left, from Marx and Engels to the post-war era, in countries as diverse as Germany and Sweden, the Soviet Union, France and Spain. Woven into the historical narratives and political discourses are extensive passages on works of art and literature from many centuries and from many European, and even non-European cultures ‚Äì from the Pergamon frieze to the temple city of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, from D√ºrer and Brueghel to G√©ricault and Picasso, from Dante to Kafka, and from Surrealism and Dadaism to Socialist realism. The novel takes upon itself the enormous task of reinterpreting the great works of western culture from the perspective of the perennial victims of history and to fuse art and politics into one inseparable revolutionary unity. In its final section the novel contains one of the great passages of world literature ‚Äì a moment by moment description of the execution, by hanging or beheading, of almost all members of the resistance group \\"Red Orchestra\\" (\\"Rote Kapelle\\") in 1942 in Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee prison. All of the characters whose end Weiss describes here, indeed all of the characters who appear in The Aesthetics of Resistance, and there are hundreds, are actual historical figures. They bear their real names in the text, and everything that happens to them is based on verifiable facts which Weiss researched in many countries and numerous archives.For biographical information on the figures in The Aesthetics of Resistance, an index of names, a chronology and other information on the novel see Robert Cohen: Bio-bibliographisches Handbuch zu Weiss' √Ñsthetik des Widerstands. Argument Verlag, 1989. In its obsession with historical facts, as in other respects, The Aesthetics of Resistance is a work which transcends all boundaries. The narrator ‚Äì the only fictional character in the novel (he bears much resemblance to Peter Weiss) ‚Äì is one of many nameless contributors to the activities of the Communist resistance. From 1937 to 1945 he wanders through much of Europe. His two friends, Heilmann and Coppi, remain in Berlin and eventually become members of the \\"Red Orchestra.\\" From time to time a letter from Heilmann reaches the narrator. In his letters Heilmann continues his struggle for a reinterpretation of the Heracles myth. Amidst the reality of fascism and in a German capital laid waste by allied bombs, however, the notion of a messianic savior becomes less and less plausible. Coppi abandons it altogether. ‚Äì Years after the war, long after Heilmann and Coppi had been hanged in Pl√∂tzensee ‚Äì this, too, is historically authentic ‚Äì the narrator once again finds himself before the Pergamon frieze in rebuilt Berlin. Heracles's place is still empty. There is no leader, no conceivable presence which can replace this absence. There is no hope for a messiah. No one other than the narrator himself and those like him can bring about their liberation. It is with this thought that the novel ends.\\"Robert Cohen: \\"Nonrational Discourse in a Work of Reason: Peter Weiss's Antifascist Novel Die √Ñsthetik des Widerstands.\\" European Memories of the Second World War.

Modeled after the catboat Honest, which was built in 1892 by Jelle Dykstra on the west bank of Greens Creek, West Sayville, Modesty was built as a gaff-rigged sloop, but retained the extreme beam of a catboat. For auxiliary power, a two-cylinder Gafka gasoline engine was installed. Modesty was described by oystermen as a true \\"southsider\\". She is believed to be the last sailing scallop dredger built on Long Island. A beautiful vessel, a fine sailer and typical of the old oyster sloops, her lines show graceful proportions in hull and rig. She has a wide beam and sits low in the water. Her shallow draft permitted her to operate commercially in the oyster and scallop flats of Long Island's bays and the river estuaries of Connecticut. The fact that she was even built at the end of the age of sail is due to a law enacted before World War I, which stipulated that only sail power could be used while dredging for scallops. By this time, many boats in the fleet had their centerboards plugged. After working as a scallop dredger in the Peconic Bay until 1936, Modesty moved to Connecticut to finish her working career as an oyster dredger. From the 1948 until 1974 she served as a pleasure yacht for various owners. When Modesty was acquired by the Long Island Maritime Museum, formerly the Suffolk Marine Museum, in 1976, Theodore Haupt, her first owner was present to receive her colors. After restoration, Modesty was relaunched in 1980 by the Museum. She was christened with a bottle of champagne mixed with water from the Great Peconic Bay and the Great South Bay. A new 1880 penny was placed under the mast along with several pre-1923 coins discovered when the mast was removed during her restoration. Modesty was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. Modesty is berthed next to the 1888 oyster dredging sloop Priscilla and near the 1908 Rudolph Oyster House, both of which are also National Historic Landmarks.

Mackenzie (1860‚Äì1926) was a noteworthy Michigan educator and administrator. Mackenzie was born in Detroit on May 28, 1860; he attended Capitol High School and the University of Michigan. Biography By 1881, David Mackenzie had earned his teaching credentials and a Master's degree. Throughout much of the 1880s, Mackenzie taught at the elementary and secondary level in Flint, Michigan; by 1888, he had been promoted to the position of Superintendent. During 1892, Mackenzie moved to west Michigan where he served twelve years as Superintendent of Muskegon Schools. In 1904, David Mackenzie came back to Detroit as the new Principal of Central High School. By 1913, under Mackenzie's direction, a one-year, college-level premedical curriculum was established at Central High - the first junior college curriculum organized in Michigan. In 1916, the program was extended to two-years, and in 1917 the state legislature approved Mackenzie's plans for establishing the Detroit Junior College. In 1919, David Mackenzie ‚Äì then Principal of Detroit Central High School and Detroit Junior College ‚Äì was officially appointed first Dean of the college that he had helped originate. With Mackenzie at the helm, Detroit Junior College became the third largest institution of higher learning in Michigan. The college was granted four-year degree status in 1923, becoming the College of the City of Detroit; David L. Mackenzie continued as Dean until his death in 1926. In 1934, the College was renamed Wayne University; it became officially known as Wayne State University in 1956. Memorial In 1928, the Detroit Board of Education dedicated its newest high school to the memory of David Mackenzie.
