Founded in 1992, the band originated in Newark, Delaware along with such other local bands of the period including Jake and the Stiffs, The Verge, Boy Sets Fire, Zen Guerilla and Smashing Orange. Heavily influenced by The Doors, My Bloody Valentine, Hawkwind, Bruce Haack, and Chrome, Spindrift's early stages were experimental and differed greatly from their present sound though the band's musical style is ever in a period of flux. In the summer of 2001, band members Kirpatrick Thomas, Joe Baluta and Zachary Hansen re-located to Los Angeles. The band re- formed to include Bobby Bones, Dave Koenig, Frankie \\"Teardrop\\" Emerson and Rob Campanella of The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Jason ‚ÄúPlucky‚Äù Anchondo of The Warlocks. Inspired by their new locale, the band began a new stylistic approach evoking the spirit of the Old West as mythologized by Western Cinema, Spaghetti Westerns in particular. In 2005, Kirpatrick Thomas along with filmmaker Mike Bruce began production on the psychedelic western independent feature film, The Legend Of God‚Äôs Gun, inspired by the same classic Western Films that influenced their music, most often those directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone. During this period (2005‚Äì2009), the lineup consisted of David Koenig on rhythm guitar and harmonica, Julie Patterson on vocals, organ, and lap steel, Jason \\"Plucky\\" Anchondo on drums, Henry Evans on double neck bass and baritone guitar, and Kirpatrick Thomas on vocals and guitar. Tours with Dead Meadow (Kirpatrick Thomas filled in for an ailing Jason Simons on guitar during one tour), The Black Angels, and The Dandy Warhols followed until November 2009 when the band suffered a major lineup change due to tour burnout and financial difficulties. It was around this time that Spindrift began performing electro-acoustic shows with a more intimate, stripped down campfire atmosphere under the name of \\"Bluniform\\" and \\"Boy Scout Jamboree\\" with Koenig and Thomas taking the lead harmonies and performing tunes written by the likes of the \\"singing cowboys\\" such as Johnny Western, Johnny Bond, Tex Ritter, The Louvin Brothers, Frankie Laine, The Sons of the Pioneers, and Rex Allen. Spindrift also began incorporating these songs into their regular set and on occasion, would play them live. This would prove to be a huge influence on their later years. In December 2009, Henry Evans and Kirpatrick Thomas began reforming and rebuilding Spindrift while rehearsing and writing new songs in the Gram Parsons death room at Joshua Tree Inn. Added were Luke Dawson (who was innkeeper at the time) on pedal steel and rhythm guitar, Sasha Vallely on vocals, organ, and Native American flute, and James Acton on autoharp, vocals, and drums. This current lineup performed at SXSW 2010, Psych Fest III, supported Black Mountain, and toured Europe for the first time with B.R.M.C. in May 2010. In December 2010 after a 7-week U.S. Tour and following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the band went in and tracked Classic Soundtracks Volume 1 at Hicksville Trailer Palace in Joshua Tree, CA. Soundtrack and television In 2008, Spindrift contributed to the soundtrack of the feature film Hell Ride produced by Quentin Tarantino. The motion picture The Legend Of God‚Äôs Gun was inspired by the Spindrift's 2002 album of the same name which was released three years prior to the making of the film. The movie's soundtrack features work from that album as well as tracks by Gram Rabbit and Mike Bruce's own band the Low-flying Owls. The album, The Legend Of God's Gun, was updated and re-released in 2007. In 2009, Tee Pee Records re-released the soundtrack and the band toured the United States, opening for The Dandy Warhols who under their Beat The World record label released the Spindrift album \\"The West\\" Nov. 2008. Spindrift has also contributed to the VBS.tv VICE documentary series Coffin Joe, and the songs \\"Ace Coletrain\\" and \\"Girlz, Booze, Gunz\\" were featured in the HBO Comedy series Eastbound & Down.\\" The band has also scored a restored version of \\"Tecumseh's Curse\\", a film about the Curse of Tippecanoe by director J.X. Williams. In 2010, Spindrift went on to supply the score to Mike Bruce's next feature \\"Treasure of the Black Jaguar\\", an action survival story loosely based on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film). Spindrift has cited the Sergio Leone film Once Upon a Time in the West and Sam Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" as cinematic influences on the band's music and overall style. In 2011, Spindrift supported the soundtrack of the award-winning skiing documentary film All.I.Can by Sherpa Cinema with three songs. The film, Dust Up, starring Amber Benson also contained a Spindrift score and was released Oct. 2012. In Jan 2016, the band contributed to the score and soundtrack of the film \\"Diablo\\" which was Directed by Lawrence Roeck and starred Scott Eastwood, Danny Glover, and Walton Goggings. As well, early that year, Cherry Red Records released the 5 disc box set title \\"Still In A Dream: A History of Shoegaze 1988-1995 which featured Spindrift's first B-Side Single (originally recorded in 1992 and released by Neck Records) called \\"Surround Sound\\". Classic Soundtracks In Spring of 2011, Spindrift released Classic Soundtracks Volume 1 on Xemu Records. The album featured 14 theme songs to various film scores they are set to and up to 8 different directors participated in the project. The film clips, music videos, and movie trailers were all premiered on IFC and featured films by Burke Roberts, J. X. Williams, Abigail Bean, Simon Chan, and many others. The music crossed genres such as Bollywood songs, Science fiction, Exploitation films, and Film noir. The album was engineered by Ethan Allen (of Gram Rabbit) and mastered by Howie Weinberg. The band went on to tour Europe in the Spring of 2011 for 2 months supporting Black Mountain, Dead Meadow, and Kurt Vile and did a full U.S. and Canadian tour in the Fall with The Black Angels and Dead Meadow totaling over 100 live shows throughout the year. Spindrift - Ghost of the West and the Ghost Town Tour In 2012, production for the album Spindrift - Ghost of the West began. The songs consisted of variations on early golden era singing cowboy tunes and originals. New styles and instrumentation were brought in such as Henry Evans playing acoustic upright bass, more trumpet, and the ever more present vocal harmonies. During the mixing with engineer Riley Bray, Kirpatrick brought forth the idea that the band should tour ghost towns, perform the songs, and document the journey. Booking, filming, and performing during the tour was a difficult process as many of the destinations were unreachable and roads and conditions were hazardous. However, the tour brought them to over twenty-one different ghost towns, including Bodie, California, Tombstone, Arizona, and Deadwood, South Dakota, and it was all tracked and filmed. Many landmarks and monuments were also reached, such as Cathedral Gorge State Park and the Sonoran Desert. The soundtrack album was released October 22, 2013, on Tee Pee Records and the feature film companion, directed by Burke Roberts, is set to follow in 2014. Directly following the Ghost Town Tour of October 2012, keyboardist-vocalist Michelle Vidal replaced Sasha Vallely due to her inability to tour from a recent back surgery. In 2013, the band toured the US with Joshua Tree desert pals Gram Rabbit, toured Europe in the spring, and once again headlined a tour around the United States in the fall in promotion of the soundtrack which included supporting the punk band X in front of a crowd of 7,500 at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, California. Guitarist Thomas Bellier from Paris, France, joined the band officially in January 2014 after guesting on guitar during several tours and independent gigs. Bellier also fronts the heavy surf-middle eastern influenced band Blaak Heat and is label-mates on Tee Pee Records. Spindrift performed and screened Spindrift - Ghost of the West at Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in January 2014. In 2015, even while the lineup lost longtime bass player Henry Evans, the band continued to tour and work on new recordings and soundtrack productions with older members including bass player Joe Baluta and drummer Daniel Allare rejoining the ranks. The band's Engineer, Riley Bray, briefly filled in for Mr. Evans taking over his famed signature custom made Danelectro double neck bass and baritone guitar. After Riley's second rehearsal, the double neck was stolen and a search went out to find the unique instrument. Remarkably, due to some detective work done by Riley and one specific fans relentless internet search, the instrument was recovered in a \\"set up and recover\\" operation which local authorities helped to set up the sting operation. Highlights from 2015 were performances at Austin's \\"Levitation\\" Psychedelic Rock Festival and \\"Desert Stars\\" festival in Yucca Valley, CA. One new member, the young, talented guitarist Becca Davidson also joined the band that year.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he works as a color commentator on Raw under the ring name Byron Saxton. He was a \\"rookie\\" on the fourth season of NXT and competed on the show's fifth season, NXT Redemption, before being eliminated on May 31, 2011. Following his elimination, he began working as a play-by-play and color commentator on NXT before eventually working on other WWE programming including Main Event, Monday Night Raw, and Friday Night SmackDown. Early life Kelly was born in Burke, Virginia. He was raised in Burke and Orlando, Florida. He studied at the University of Florida, where he worked as a producer and a reporter for WRUF-AM, WUFT-FM, and WUFT-TV. He graduated in 2003. Kelly worked as an associate producer for WJXT Channel 4 News in Jacksonville, and was then promoted to work on camera as a traffic reporter. It was revealed in The JBL and Cole Show that he was in the same kindergarten class with Alex Riley. Saxton lives in Tampa, Florida . Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE= Florida Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì2005) Kelly signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). Kelly, at first using his real name, made his FCW debut on October 13, 2007, losing to Hade Vansen. His next appearance was just over a week later on October 23, when he lost to \\"The Carnival Freak\\" Sinn Bowdee. Kelly competed sporadically in FCW over the next few months, winning a six-man tag team match against Vansen, Sheamus O'Shaunessy and Bowdee with Rycklon Stephens and Chet Douglas as his partners, but losing a singles match to Afa Jr. a few weeks later. He finished off 2007 with a win against Tommy Taylor on December 18. Bryan Kelly in March 2008 Kelly started off 2008 with a win, defeating Steve Lewington on FCW's first show of the year on January 8. His next match against Afa Jr., however, was ruled a no contest after TJ Wilson interfered. Kelly then began teaming with Rycklon, losing to the teams of Nick Nemeth and Big Rob, Jake Hager and Shawn Osborne, and Heath Miller and Steve Lewington. Another match on April 15, when Kelly and Rycklon faced Johnny Curtis and Gabe Tuft ended in a double countout. On June 3, Kelly became a manager, cutting a promo for Black Pain. Kelly managed Black Pain regularly, accompanying him for matches, and also teaming occasionally with him. On September 30, Kelly debuted a new ring name, Byron Saxton. With Black Pain, and the rest of his faction, known as the Saxton Conglomerate or simply the Conglomerate, composed of Stu Sanders (later Lawrence Knight) and Tyson Tarver, Saxton began a feud with Kafu, having the members of the Conglomerate face off against him in matches. After this feud ended, the Conglomerate quickly began another one with Johnny Prime. In the course of this feud Kaleb O'Neal began teaming with Prime in order to help him out, however, O'Neal later turned on Prime and joined the Conglomerate. In January 2009, Black Pain broke away from the Conglomerate and changed his ring name to Sweet Papi Sanchez, prompting a feud with the remaining Conglomerate members. Following that, Saxton associated himself with Abraham Washington. When Josh Mathews left FCW to commentate on ECW full-time, Saxton began working as a commentator alongside first Dusty Rhodes and then Abraham Washington. In November 2010 Saxton turned on Washington and began feuding with him. Following his stints on ECW and NXT Redemption, Saxton returned to FCW as a commentator and wore an arm sling, claiming to be injured and unable to compete until the March 4th, 2012 episode when Saxton unexpectedly removed his sling and hit Kenneth Cameron with a Coin roll.Resulta of FCW 4th March A match was scheduled between Saxton and Cameron the following week, but Saxton once again claimed to be injured and unable to compete and was replaced in the match by Colin Cassady. Saxton then worked as an announcer for the remainder of FCW's tenure until the promotion was shut down in August 2012.Results of FCW 11th March ECW (2005‚Äì2012) Saxton (right) with Curt Hawkins commentating in FCW In October 2009, the SmackDown color commentator, Jim Ross, suffered a Bell's palsy attack, resulting in a shuffle of the other commentators. Matt Striker was moved from ECW to SmackDown, and Saxton was called up to ECW as a commentator, working alongside Josh Mathews. He debuted on the October 27 episode. He continued commentating until February 2010, when Vince McMahon announced that ECW was to be replaced with NXT. Saxton then returned to FCW in March of that year. NXT (2012‚Äì2013) On the third season finale of NXT on November 30 it was announced that Saxton would be competitor on season four, with Chris Masters as his mentor. He made his in- ring debut on the December 14 episode of NXT, teaming with Masters in a loss to Brodus Clay and his mentor, Ted DiBiase. Earlier that night, Saxton won the karaoke challenge, earning a point towards immunity from elimination. He earned his first win on the following episode when he teamed with Masters and WWE Diva Natalya to defeat Clay, DiBiase, and Maryse in a six-person mixed tag team match. On January 4, 2011 episode of NXT, Dolph Ziggler became Saxton's new Pro, after Ziggler won a Battle royal to earn the right to choose a new rookie and he chose Saxton. On the February 8 episode of NXT, Saxton was eliminated. In March 2011, Saxton was selected as one of the six former NXT contestants to return to the show in its fifth season, NXT Redemption. During this season, Saxton was mentored by Yoshi Tatsu. On the April 26 Edition of NXT, Saxton attacked Tatsu after he cost him the match against Lucky Cannon. Going into late May 2011, he began referring to himself as \\"Big League\\" Byron Saxton, believing that he is bigger than the NXT Rookies and/ or the WWE Pros, turning heel. On the following week (the last day of May), Saxton was voted off of NXT Redemption. Byron Saxton made his return as the play-by-play commentator for the relaunched NXT on the May 17, 2012 taping at Full Sail University. Later on he would become the NXT ring announcer in addition to having some creative responsibilities for the company. Saxton continued to perform as a commentator for NXT until the December 23, 2015 episode of the show. Main roster (2013‚Äìpresent) Saxton in April 2016 On January 27, 2014, Saxton made his Raw debut on the WWE App. Three days later on January 30 he appeared alongside Tom Phillips as a commentator on WWE Superstars. On the February 10, 2014 edition of Raw Saxton conducted a backstage interview with Sheamus and was announced as the newest member of the WWE announce team by Michael Cole. Saxton continued to announce on NXT as a heel, while simultaneously appearing neutral on the main roster. On the May 13, 2014 episode of Main Event, Saxton was attacked by Alicia Fox after she lost her match to Emma. On January 8, 2015, it was announced that Saxton would join the announce team on WWE SmackDown and by Fastlane he was called \\"the voice\\" of the show. On the March 30, 2015 edition of Raw the night after WrestleMania 31, Saxton and Jerry Lawler filled in for Michael Cole, JBL, and Booker T after they were brutally assaulted by Brock Lesnar. From the June 8 episode of Raw, Saxton filled in on commentary for Booker T, who would be one of the coaches on the sixth season of WWE Tough Enough, with Jimmy Uso filling in for Saxton on SmackDown. In July, Saxton would become the new host of the WWE Network show, Tough Talk, replacing former host The Miz, who would become the new judge on Tough Enough after the Hulk Hogan scandal. After Tough Enough ended, Saxton was kept on as Raw announcer permanently and Booker T switched to the SmackDown announce team. In December 2015, Saxton left the NXT announce team and rejoined the SmackDown announce team along with Mauro Ranallo, replacing Booker T and Rich Brennan. Saxton left the SmackDown announce team in July 2016 and became exclusive to the Raw announce team following the 2016 WWE Draft, performing as a face commentator in contrast to Corey Graves' heel commentary. Saxton's character is often bullied by villainous characters, including Graves, John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield and Kevin Owens and, occasionally, by fellow babyface commentator, Michael Cole. On April 10, after Raw went off- air, it was announced that Saxton was traded to the SmackDown brand in exchange for David Otunga. On January 27, 2020, Saxton returned to the Raw announce team alongside Tom Phillips and Jerry Lawler. On May 15, he became the play-by-play commentator on 205 Live.

Its main summit is located in New York; it is the highest point in that state's Dutchess County. The New York and Massachusetts portions of the mountain are within protected areas; Taconic State Park and Mount Washington State Forest respectively. The Connecticut portions are privately owned and conserved. It is a challenging yet popular hike since its summit, along with subpeak South Brace Mountain, are along the South Taconic Trail. Hikers approach the mountain either from the New York side on the west via the South Taconic or from another trail following the Connecticut-Massachusetts state line on the east, a route that allows them to visit both the tristate marker and the highest point in Connecticut, near the summit of Mount Frissell, along the way. Brace's bald summit, marked by a large cairn, offers views in all directions, particularly to the Hudson Valley and Catskills to the west. It has become a popular site for launching hang gliders and paragliders. Geography Brace is near the south end of an escarpment roughly paralleling the Connecticut and Massachusetts state lines, which runs north-south east of the summit, in North East, New York, at the northeast corner of a narrow northward extension of Dutchess County. To its east is the largely undeveloped, privately owned Riga Plateau, with Riga Lake, Connecticut's highest at , to the south in the town of Salisbury, Connecticut. Due east, on the other escarpment, is Bear Mountain, Connecticut's highest summit. There is a 100-foot (30 m) drop into the col between Brace and South Brace, a quarter- mile (250 m) to the south. The ridge continues to the south for several miles past the lower Mount Riga and Thorpe Mountain before ending where U.S. Route 44 crosses the state line. One mile (1.6 km) to the northeast is the nearest other summit, Mount Frissell, located just over Connecticut's northern border in Mount Washington, Massachusetts. A short distance from the summit, the state line reaches , the highest elevation in Connecticut. To its east is Round Mountain, in Connecticut. Approximately north-northeast of Brace's summit is the tripoint where New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts meet. The ridge continues north-northwest to Alander Mountain, in the western corner of Massachusetts, where the highest point in New York's Columbia County is located at the state line below the summit. Beyond that it continues to Catamount Ski Area, straddling the state line. The west slope of the ridge drops steeply to the narrow floor of the north end of the Harlem Valley, also known as the Oblong, the region of Dutchess County within a short distance of the state line, claimed by both New York and Connecticut during the colonial era. Here there are some farms and houses, with New York State Route 22 and the Harlem Valley Rail Trail running through. Across the valley, in the town of Ancram, rises Fox Hill. Four miles (6.4 km) to the south is the village of Millerton, New York, the nearest large settlement. The small hamlet of Copake, New York, is three miles (5 km) to the north-northwest. In Connecticut, Lakeville is to the southwest of the Riga Plateau area. The west side of Brace Mountain drains into the Noster Kill, then into Bash Bish Brook, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, thence the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean. The southwest side drains into Webatuck Creek, Ten Mile River, thence the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound. The southeast side drains into Riga Lake and South Pond, then into Wachocostinook Brook, Salmon Creek, and the Housatonic River. The north side drains into Ashley Hill Brook, thence Bash Bish Brook, and the Roeliff Jansen Kill. Access The white-blazed South Taconic Trail traverses the summit. It provides for both access from the west, via its southern terminus, and the east via the connecting Mt. Frissell trail along the Connecticut-Massachusetts state line. An old, unmarked dirt road also connects to the South Taconic north of the summit from more directly east of the mountain. Other access routes that once approached from the Riga Lake area at the southeast have been closed in Connecticut by the landowner, their blazes removed in New York. Approaching via the South Taconic from the west, entirely within New York, is a common route to the summit but also entails the greatest vertical ascent. The trailhead for the South Taconic is located on Quarry Hill Road, a long dead-end street in the northern section of North East, at an elevation just under 1,000 feet (300 m). After passing along the edge of an old meadow, it enters the woods, crosses into Taconic State Park and then climbs steeply past a series of cascades on the south side, at some points requiring that hikers scramble. It levels off at , where the first of many views over Dutchess and Columbia counties to the Catskill Escarpment on the other side of the Hudson River open up. At that point it turns north and goes through some private lands over South Brace to Brace. The total distance from the trailhead is with a vertical gain. alt=A square stone post with the letters \\"NY\\" on one face set into the ground in a wooded area On the west the Mount Frissell Trail starts following red blazes at a trailhead on the state line, on an unpaved road known as East Street in Mount Washington and Mt. Washington Road in Salisbury. From an elevation of It first bends into Massachusetts, then returns to Connecticut where it climbs to the open summit of Round Mountain, where Frissell and Brace can be seen ahead. Descending into the woods, it re-enters Massachusetts and makes a short but steep climb to the summit of Frissell. A register for visitors to the Connecticut high point hangs from a tree; the highpoint itself is marked by a small survey stake a short distance further along the trail, after it descends slightly and follows the state line. From the highpoint it drops gently to pass the tri-state marker. Its western terminus, from the trailhead, is on the South Taconic approximately north of Brace's summit. It is thus via this approach, with a vertical gain of roughly 1,000 ft (300 m) due to the ascents of Round and Frissell required by the route. The approach via the unofficial Brace Mountain Trail is the gentlest and shortest, but less used due to the limited parking and minimal maintenance of the trail, entirely on private land in Connecticut. The unblazed, gated road starts from a small parking area on Mount Washington Road two miles (3.2 km) north of the dam at South Pond in Lakeville, just south of where the road, the highest in Connecticut, crosses the shoulder of Gridley Mountain. From this elevation it descends slightly to cross an unnamed tributary of Monument Brook, after which an overgrown ascends gently to the state line marker, from the parking area. From there it is a more sustained climb to the South Taconic and an equivalent distance to the summit. The total distance for this approach is with a vertical gain from the brook crossing.New York Walk Book, 199‚Äì200. There are also two long approaches from the north. On the New York side, the red-blazed Robert Brook Trail leaves the blue-blazed Alander Brook Trail from that trail's head along Under Mountain Road in Ancram. From there it climbs in to the South Taconic Trail just west of the state line, north of Brace's summit. In Massachusetts, the blue-blazed Ashley Hill Trail leaves the Alander Mountain Trail west of the Mount Washington State Forest headquarters at the junction of East and West streets. Two possible forks allow for a 4-mile (6.4 km) route to Brace via the Mount Frissell Trail. alt=A pile of stones in a grassy clearing in late autumn. A pole with a small windsock protrudes from its right Summit The summit of Brace is an open area with scrubby forest on the slopes. A cairn several feet high, with a small windsock attached, sits on the highest ground. There are views available in all directions. To the west are the highest mountains visible from Brace, the Catskills. The dominant visible feature is the long Escarpment to the north, with Hunter Mountain, the highest point of Greene County, high above the peaks of the Devil's Path beyond it. Further south are the peaks of Ulster County, including Slide, the highest in that county and the Catskills at . Northwest the Helderberg Escarpment is visible, south of Albany. Closer to the mountain, the lower hills of Columbia and Dutchess counties are below. In the latter, Stissing Mountain and its fire tower, south of Pine Plains stand out. The Hudson Highlands are in the distant southwest. To the east the landscape falls away into the Riga Plateau, with Gridley and Bear rising across it. Riga Lake can be seen to the south of them. The higher peaks of the vicinity, Frissell and Round, are visible on the northeast, although the former blocks the view of Mount Everett, the peak of the south Taconics. Next to Frissell, in the distance on clear days, Mount Greylock, Massachusetts' highest peak, can be seen. Due north is Alander. Hang gliding and paragliding The Mount Brace Outdoor Club, based in the valley below the mountain, operates the landing zone for hang gliding and paragliding from the summit. All such foot-launched aircraft pilots must sign in at the club, whether or not they are members. This is done under permit with the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; pilots who do not check in with the club can be cited and fined. Pilots must obey some other rules as well. They must be current United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA) members with a rating of at least P3/H2 to fly without instructor supervision; P2/H2-rated pilots must have a minimum of 10 mountain flights from more than a thousand feet (300 m) above ground level, witnessed by an instructor, in their logbooks in order to fly unsupervised, since the launch area at the summit is steep and narrow. No flights are permitted on days with winds of more than . The windsock on the summit cairn was placed to allow the pilots to judge conditions. They hike in either from the east via the old road or up the South Taconic from its southern trailhead. There are some other lower launch areas lower on the mountain, on private land. It is one of the more popular locations for hang gliding and paragliding in the Northeast due to the gradual geography of the area and the thermals allowing smooth flight down the to the LZ at the club facilities.

FC Kleve is a German association football club from the city of Kleve, North Rhine-Westphalia very near the Dutch border. The club was established in 2000 out of the merger of VfB Lohengrin 03 Kleve and Sportclub Kleve 63. The footballers are today part of a larger sports club that also has departments for aerobics, gymnastics, Karate, and tennis. __TOC__ History =Sportclub Kleve 63= SC Kleve was founded in 1906 as Fussball Club Cleve and merged with Spieleverein 1909 Cleve in 1917 to create FC Hohenzollern Cleve. Two years later the club was briefly known as Verein f√ºr Jungend und Volksspiele Cleve before becoming part of Turnverein Cleve 1863. In 1924, the footballers left to form an independent club called Sportclub Cleve 1863. After 1925 the city was known as \\"Kleve\\" and the sports club adopted the same form. Following World War II, SC made occasional appearances as a lower table side in third tier football in the Amateurliga Niederrhein. Following the reorganization of German football and the formation of the top-flight Bundesliga in 1963, SC managed another three season of third division play (1963‚Äì64, 1969‚Äì71) before slipping back to lower level local competition. =VfB Lohengrin 03 Kleve= The Lohengrin side was established in 1903 as VfB Cleve and was made up largely of workers from the \\"van-den-Berghschen Margarinewerke\\" earning them the nickname \\"de Botter\\". The club's home field Sportplatz an der Triftstra√üe was built with the support of the margarine company and on 16 October 1910 was the site of the first international match between Germany and Holland held on German soil (1:2). This team merged with Turnclub Merkur and Clever Schwimm- Sportclub in 1920 to form Verein f√ºr Turn- und Bewegungsspiele Cleve. A new association known as VfL 95 Merkur Cleve was formed out of this club the following year and they quickly re-adopted the traditional name VfB 03 Cleve. After 1925 this side also used the form \\"Kleve\\". In January 1946, VfB joined SuL Kleve, itself formed through the 1936 merger of VfB Lohengrin 1921 and FC Sparta 1921 Kleve, to create VfB Lohengrin 03 Kleve. Like SC, VfB made occasional appearances in third tier football in the Amateurliga Niederrhein and had a similarly undistinguished record at that level. =1. FC Kleve= These key predecessor sides were acknowledged with the adoption of the name 1. FC Kleve 1863/1903 in the 2000 merger that formed the present-day club. In 2003, 1. FC won its way to the Oberliga Nordrhein (IV) where they competed until 2008, when the club earned promotion to the new Regionalliga West. The club has declined since then, being relegated from the Regionalliga in 2009 and the Oberliga in 2011, playing in the tier six Landesliga Niederrhein for a time. A second-place finish in 2014‚Äì15 took the club to the play-offs for promotion to what is now the Oberliga Niederrhein which they lost to eventual winner SC D√ºsseldorf-West with the same result in the following season, this time losing to Cronenberger SC.

Smith. It was simultaneously published in 1960 by Gnome Press in an edition of 3,000 copies and by Fantasy Press in an edition of 341 copies. The book was originally intended to be published by Fantasy Press, but was handed over to Gnome Press when Fantasy Press folded. Lloyd Eshbach, of Fantasy Press, who was responsible for the printing of both editions, printed the extra copies for his longtime customers. The stories originally appeared in the magazines Comet and Astonishing Stories. In 1968, Pyramid Books issued a paperback edition under the title Masters of the Vortex, promoting it as \\"the final adventure in the famous Lensman series.\\"Masters of the Vortex, Pyramid Books, 1968, front cover copy While the stories are set in the same universe as the Lensman novels, they are only tangentially related. They reference events that happen in the Lensman series, but only ‚Äúoff stage‚Äù. No characters from the other Lensmen books show up in this book. From the events spoken of in this book it apparently falls between Second Stage Lensmen and Children of the Lens. Plot summary The hero of the book is Neal \\"Storm\\" Cloud. Although the story happens in the ‚ÄúLensman‚Äù universe he is not a Lensman. Instead he is a nuclear engineer with an amazingly mathematical mind. He is a high level genius and a lightning calculator. In his universe there is something we have apparently don't have in ours, self-sustaining vortices of atomic energy. These are like a small piece of the heart of a star. A churning vortex of heat and light that slowly grows while consuming whatever it is in contact with. In theory they can be blown out by a precise amount of explosives, placed at an exact spot in the vortex, at exactly the right time. The problem is, it takes the best computers available hours to calculate the factors needed, and only seconds are available to get the correct amount of explosives on target. Also, if you try to blow one out, but don't get the factors right, all you do is split the vortex into many separate vortices and scatter them far and wide, and soon each is as dangerous as the original. Although Storm Cloud, being a nuclear engineer and lightning calculator, should be able to calculate the factors and extinguish a vortex, in practice he can't. It would be very dangerous and Storm has a wife and kids, and putting himself in that kind of danger ties his mind up with worry so much that he just can't do it. Then things change in a major way. Cloud's family is tragically killed when a misguided attempt blow out a vortex lands one of the fragments right on his house. Devastated by the loss of his family, Cloud takes a leave of absence from the Radiation Lab where he works studying the vortices. As he drives he is struck with an idea for \\"blowing out\\" a vortex. It is slightly technical (Smith explains it so it can be easily followed), but the general idea is that Cloud's brain works so fast that he can calculate exactly where the center of the vortex will be at a moment in time and how big an explosive is needed, then hit it with a bomb that is set at the exact strength to actually extinguish the vortex instead of blowing it apart and making more vortices. This works, and it makes Cloud a very popular guy. As it continues the book tells of Cloud's new job as the universe's one and only vortex blaster. This job takes him from planet to planet where he blows out vortices, matches wits against drug dealers and gangsters, meets new life forms, and acquires a crew for his small scout ship. His adventures are many and varied, and the lifeforms he meets are strange and interesting. Eventually the Galactic Patrol decides that having only one ‚ÄúVortex Blaster‚Äù is inviting disaster. If something happens to Storm Cloud, they are at the mercy of the loose vortices again. As a result, Dr. Cloud is called back to Tellus (what the Earth is called in Smith's stories) and given a new ship. A specially modified, light cruiser (called Vortex Blaster II ) outfitted to carry everything that is needed to extinguish vortices. He is also introduced to Joan Janowick, the leading computer expert of Civilization. Her job is to build a computer that can reproduce whatever it was that Storm Cloud does and blow out vortices like he can. Working closely with Joan on a series of ever faster computers, his eyes soon turn more and more toward his pretty, super smart, and self-taught psychic co-worker and his heart begins to heal. As they fall in love, he bonds psionically with Joan, a pivotal point in the novel, as this leads him to find and communicate with the pure-energy alien beings that have been unknowingly causing the problems. The original vortices are found to be the incubators that an alien species uses to breed and raise its young! That makes the Vortex Blaster an inadvertent murderer of children, a fact that does cause him anguish. In the end an agreement is reached, the aliens close down the \\"incubators\\" and move their offspring to vortices the Patrol has helped set up on uninhabited planets. As the story ends, \\"Storm\\" Cloud, the Vortex Blaster, is out of a job.

Kappa Sigma is one of the five largest international fraternities with currently 318 active chapters and colonies in North America. Its endowment fund, founded in 1919, has donated more than $5 million to undergrads since 1948. In 2012 alone, the Fraternity's endowment fund raised over $1 million in donations. History =Traditional founding: 1400= According to the traditions of the fraternity, Kappa Sigma evolved from an ancient order, known in some accounts as \\"Kirjath Sepher\\", said to have been founded between 1395 and 1400 at the University of Bologna.Patterson (1913), p. 597.Baird (1898), p. 143. The story says that the corrupt governor of the city, one-time pirate and later papal usurper Baldassare Cossa, took advantage of the students at Bologna, one of Europe's preeminent universities which attracted students from all over the continent, by sending his men to assault and rob them; this motivated one of the university's scholars Manuel Chrysoloras to found a secret society of students beginning with five of his most devoted disciples, for mutual protection against Baldassare Cossa. =American founding: 1869‚Äì1880= 46 East Lawn residence at the University of Virginia, site of the founding of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity On December 10, 1869, five students at the University of Virginia met in 46 East Lawn and founded the Kappa Sigma Fraternity in America. William Grigsby McCormick, George Miles Arnold, John Covert Boyd, Edmund Law Rogers, Jr., and Frank Courtney Nicodemus established the fraternity based on the traditions and of the ancient order in Bologna. These five founders became collectively known as the \\"Five Friends and Brothers\\". In 1872, Kappa Sigma initiated Stephen Alonzo Jackson, who would go on to transform a struggling local fraternity into a strong international Brotherhood. The organization attributes much of its success to Jackson noting that, \\"Since his death in 1892, the success of the Order is the direct result of Jackson's devotion 'to make Kappa Sigma the leading college fraternity of the world.'\\" In 1873, Kappa Sigma expanded to Trinity College (now Duke University), the University of Maryland, and Washington and Lee University. The fraternity attributes this growth to the initiation of Stephen Alonzo Jackson in 1872. During his membership, Jackson expanded and revised the ritual of Kappa Sigma. He created the Supreme Executive Committee (SEC), which now serves as the governing body of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity on an international level. Jackson also introduced the idea of a frequent, national convention of all Kappa Sigmas, a practice now continued by the biennial Grand Conclave, and characterized the event as \\"the finest hour\\" of Kappa Sigma. =History: 1880‚Äì2000= In 1885, the publication of Kappa Sigma's quarterly magazine was commissioned under the name The Quarterly This publication ran successfully for 5 years until it was reorganized to run bi-monthly and renamed The Caduceus, the name it holds to this day.Baird (1898), p. 148. The Kappa Sigma chapter house at the University of New Hampshire in 1923. In 1912, Wilbur F. Denious (who would later become Worthy Grand Master) struck upon the idea to establish a charitable endowment for Kappa Sigma. As a result of the hard work of him and many others, the Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund was established in 1919 \\"to support the charitable and beneficent purposes of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\\" =Recent history= In 2002, along with Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma ended its involvement in the North American Interfraternity Conference at the national level due to disenchantment with the strategic direction of the organization. However, many individual chapters remain members of their host university's Interfraternity Conference, but no chapter is required to recognize or be involved with their university's IFC if they should choose not to. In 2003, the Kappa Sigma Fraternity ushered in an unprecedented era of growth for the fraternity. In the Spring of 2005, Kappa Sigma Fraternity began fundraising for and construction of a new headquarters. This $6 million project had its grand opening on June 2, 2007. At the 66th Conclave, the Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund was declared to be the only official educational foundation of the fraternity and is also housed at the new headquarters. Membership The Star and Crescent Kappa Sigmas are taught to live their lives by the Star and Crescent, which are also the symbols of the Fraternity that make up the official badge: They also follow the four pillars of the Fraternity: Fellowship, Leadership, Scholarship, and Service. The Star and Crescent is also used as part of the guidelines behind Kappa Sigma's strict no-tolerance anti-hazing policy. The Fraternity takes all allegations of hazing very seriously and routinely revokes charters from guilty chapters which can be as old as 130 years. To be eligible for membership a prospective member must profess a belief in God, though adherence to a specific religion is not required. In at least one situation, Kappa Sigma has revoked a chapter's charter for omitting the fraternity's religious requirements from its initiation. Organization University of Illinois chapter house, listed in the National Register of Historic Places =Undergraduate organization= The Kappa Sigma Fraternity consists of over 300 chapters and colonies (probationary chapters). Each chapter is led by a five-member Executive Committee (EC), each referred to as an officer. These officers consist of the Grand Master (President), Grand Procurator (First Vice President), Grand Master of Ceremonies (Second Vice President), Grand Scribe (Secretary), and Grand Treasurer. Each chapter and colony also has a number of committee chairs that are assigned to specific areas (e.g. scholarship, sports, community service). =Volunteer organization= Over 1,500 alumni volunteer as advisors for Kappa Sigma. At the international level, the Supreme Executive Council (SEC) sets policy for the fraternity, disciplines chapters, and approves the formation of colonies and chapter. The offices of the SEC mirror the office of the undergraduate EC and consist of the Worthy Grand Master (WGM), the Worthy Grand Procurator (WGP), the Worthy Grand Master of Ceremonies (WGMC), the Worthy Grand Scribe (WGS), and the Worthy Grand Treasurer (WGT). The WGM, WGP, and the WGMC each serve a two-year term, while the WGS and WGT each serve a four-year term with either the WGS or the WGT elected along with the other officers at the biennial Grand Conclave. There are just under sixty districts covering America and Canada divided into five Areas. Typically, districts are composed of all the Kappa Sigma chapters and colonies within a State or Province, or a portion of a State or Province. Each district, composed of roughly 5 chapters each, are overseen by the District Grand Masters (DGM) and Assistant District Grand Masters (ADGM) who serve as liaisons between the undergraduate chapters and colonies and the SEC. An Alumnus Adviser (an AA) and several Assistant Alumnus Advisers (AAA), provide advice and assistance to each undergraduate chapter and colony. Along with the Alumnus Adviser, there are traditionally one Assistant Alumnus Adviser for each of the four EC positions other than Grand Master. That is, there are AAAs for the undergraduate offices of GP, GMC, GT, and GS respectively. There also exists several committees (each with a volunteer commissioner) under the SEC (e.g. ritual committee, business and finance committee, long-range planning committee). Each committee is made up strictly of volunteers and some contain various targeted subcommittees. The Undergraduate Advisory Committee (UAC), which is made of one undergraduate from each of the five areas, is charged with representing their respective area as well as the general undergraduate perspective at all SEC meetings. Kappa Sigma Fraternity International Headquarters =Professional staff= There is a professional staff that's based at the international headquarters in Charlottesville, Virginia, which manages the day-to-day operations of the Fraternity . The staff includes the Executive Director, currently Mitchell Wilson, as well as multiple program- directors and administrative assistants. Also, based in the international headquarters are the Area Recruitment Managers (ARM), who are in charge of recruitment goals and provide assistance to chapters in their respective service area. General fraternity While most activities of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity occur at the undergraduate chapters, the Fraternity oversees four international programs or campaigns. =A Greater Cause program= The Greater Cause program is designed to record the activities and reinforce the concept that Kappa Sigma members should play an active role in their communities. Specifically, the program aims at raising $25 for and dedicating 25 hours per year towards charitable causes for each member. The program also aims at having 100% of the eligible chapter members registered to vote. Every chapter organizes its own charitable events, usually donating the proceeds to Kappa Sigma's Military Heroes Campaign or a local charity. Some of the bigger events that chapters organize are the \\"Catch-A-Dream Charity Classic Football Game\\" organized by the Delta-Chi Chapter at Mississippi State University, and the \\"Apple Cup Run,\\" jointly organized by the Beta-Psi Chapter at the University of Washington and the Gamma-Mu Chapter at Washington State University. Or, the \\"Governor's Cup Ball Run,\\" jointly organized by the Mu-Eta Chapter at the University of Louisville and the Beta-Nu Chapter at the University of Kentucky. The Chi-Omega Chapter at the University of South Carolina raises money annually for the Ray Tanner Foundation, which benefits economically and medically disadvantaged children in South Carolina, and the Columbia metropolitan area. The Kappa-Pi Chapter at the University of Central Oklahoma hosts the Bath Tub push that benefits the Veterans' Families United Foundation. During the 2015-2016 school year, Kappa Sigma chapters and colonies donated $3,653,930 million and 671,537 volunteer hours to charitable causes around the United States and Canada. =Champion Quest program= Kappa Sigma's Champion Quest Program is a \\"results-driven\\" recruitment initiative aimed at increasing the number of men added to the Kappa Sigma each year. The fraternity attributes its success to \\"its pursuit of Jackson's Dream\\", a reference to the dream of the influential member Steven Alonzo Jackson, and notes that the campaign has \\"yielded thirteen consecutive years of record- setting membership growth and elevated Kappa Sigma to new heights, as the most preferred college fraternity in North America.\\" =Brothers in Action program= Brothers in Action (BIA) is the \\"official membership development program of Kappa Sigma Fraternity\\" which seeks both individual and chapter development through goal setting and through emphasizing the four cornerstones of Kappa Sigma: Fellowship, Leadership, Scholarship and Service. The Brothers in Action program begins with the \\"BIA for Pledges program\\" and continues throughout your involvement with Kappa Sigma, including opportunities for personal growth and development at the various leadership conferences and conclaves. =Military Heroes Campaign= During the 66th Grand Conclave in 2007, the Fraternity announced a new charity entitled the \\"Kappa Sigma Fraternity Military Heroes Campaign\\". Since its inception, the campaign has donated over $1,000,000 to non-profit organizations who advocate on behalf of servicemen and women and those wounded in combat. The Supreme Executive Committee determines how the contributions will be distributed to support these patriots and veterans. Some of these charities include the Fisher House Foundation, the SEAL Legacy Foundation, and the Valour Place. Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund In 1919, the Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund was established \\"to support the charitable and beneficent purposes of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity\\". The Endowment Fund's first donors contributed $101 as the foundation for the fund's assets. Currently, the Endowment Fund has two primary recognition levels for donors, the One of Jackson's Men program - for donors who contributed $1000 or more to the Endowment Fund, and the Heritage Society for planned gift donors. The Endowment Fund assists with the educational and leadership programming at each Conclave and Leadership Conference. In addition, each year, the Endowment Fund awards $250,000 in scholarships to undergraduate members. These Scholarship and Leadership Awards are presented on Founders' Day (December 10). To date, the Endowment Fund has contributed over $5 million in scholarships since 1948. Currently, the Endowment Fund, along with the Kappa Sigma Fraternity, holds in trust for the members of Kappa Sigma, the fraternity's headquarters in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Endowment Fund sponsors leadership conferences and Kappa Sigma's Biennial Grand Conclave. In 2015, the 70th Biennial Grand Conclave was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Controversies In 2020, the chapter at Fresno State University was placed on interim suspension after they were accused of sexual assault at a party. Once hearing of the accusation, the university president immediately suspended the fraternity pending an investigation. In 2019, the chapter at the University of Central Florida was suspended and placed under conduct review by the university after a pledge reported to authorities his pledge class were ordered to smoke pot, drink entire bottles of alcohol, and sometimes sell their prescribed drugs ‚Äì like Adderall ‚Äì to fraternity members. He also reported they were made to stand in pitch black hallways in suit and tie while fraternity members yelled insults and that cocaine use was popular in the fraternityhttps://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2019/11/27/ucf-frat- kappa-sigma-suspended-for-hazing In 2018, the chapter at the University of Arizona was shut down after an investigation found multiple violations of the university's student code of conduct. The chapter will be eligible to seek reinstatement in May 2023 and was the second fraternity on campus to be shut down in 2018 due to multiple misconduct violations. In 2017, two civil lawsuits were filed against the fraternity and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL) by the family of a deceased ULL student killed by a Kappa Sigma pledge in 2016. Rustam Nizamutdinova, an undergraduate engineering student from Uzbekistan, was walking down a street when he was struck by a car driven by a Kappa Sigma pledge who fell asleep at the wheel. The pledge was severely sleep-deprived due to his illegal and strenuous pledging process. The fraternity's charter at ULL was revoked and five other Greek organizations received varying levels of disciplinary action after Nizamutdinova's death initiated thorough investigations into Greek culture on campus.http://www.katc.com/story/36796018/former-kappa-sigma-pledge-blames- hazing-for-crash-that-killed-uzbek-student In 2017, dozens of Kappa Sigma members initiated at Louisiana State University were expelled by the national leadership of the fraternity for allegations of repeated hazing violations, drug usage, and misconduct. In 2016, the Kappa Sigma fraternity at California State University, Long Beach was suspended after a female student reported to authorities she was sexually assaulted while attending a party they hosted. National leadership of the fraternity suspended the chapter as a result of the incident. In 2015, the chapter at Cornell University was placed on suspension and lost all alcohol privileges due to repeated hazing and alcohol violations. In 2015, the Kappa Sigma fraternity at Miami University ceased to be recognized by the national headquarters because of hazing, which included forcing pledges to work out between 3:30 a.m. and 6 a.m., no showers, cleaning fraternity member rooms, forced alcohol consumption, and buying fraternity members food. In 2015, two Kappa Sigma members from the West Virginia University were arrested and charged with hazing and conspiracy for the death of Nolan Burch at a Big/Little event four days after the chapter had been closed by the Fraternity. Burch died due to alcohol poisoning, his blood alcohol level was .493. In 2014, the Kappa Sigma fraternity at the University of Kansas was placed on a two-year suspension after two female students reported to authorities they were victims of sexual assault on two different occasions while attending a party at the fraternity house. At a Kappa Sigma fraternity house at Tulane University in 2013, police found grams of marijuana, 68.7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, over 50 doses of LSD, .91 grams of DMT, 47.6 grams of opium and paraphernalia, and .75 grams of powdered cocaine. Two fraternity members were arrested and charge for possession of the drugs. In 2006, four Kappa Sigma members and an alumnus member from Winthrop University were arrested for detonating ice bombs in the backyard of their fraternity house. The fraternity was placed on social suspension by national leadership of the fraternity.https://www.winthrop.edu/news- events/article.aspx?id=7914 In 2001, an 18-year-old freshman named Chad Meredith, who was interested in joining the chapter at the University of Miami, drowned after being persuaded by fraternity members to swim across a nearly seven-foot-deep lake near campus. Meredith had a blood alcohol level of .13 prior to his death. Although fraternity officials and Miami-Dade Police stated the incident was not a fraternity-sanctioned hazing event, a jury found otherwise and awarded Meredith's parents a $12.6 million verdict in a negligence suit based on hazing. As a result of Meredith's death, a law was named in his honor making hazing officially a criminal offense in the State of Florida.

In Europe, it is present in all countries. Description The beetle is black or dull and usually hairy. The species is often found underneath dead animals that have decomposed for several days to weeks. Their eating habits can cause a dead animal to become just a skeleton. The appearance of the beetle on decomposing remains of humans and other animals can be used to estimate postmortem interval in cases of suicide, homicide, or unattended death. The adults generally arrive within 5 to 11 days following an animal's death. The larvae develop for five to seven weeks, and the adult beetles live for four to six months. Pests The beetle feeds on carrion and dry animal products. They are pests of the silk industry in Italy and India. Dried fish, cheese, bacon, dog treats, and poultry are some of the foods that the beetle gets into. The beetle has been known to attack and eat live turkeys. Larvae Illustration of Dermestes maculatus from Edmund Reitter \\"Fauna Germanica\\" The bodies of the larvae are covered in setae. The bottom of the abdomen is yellowish-brown while the dorsal surface is dark brown, usually with a yellow line in the middle. There are two urogomphi that are on the upper surface of the last segment and curve upward and away from the tip of the abdomen. The pupa is shaped like an oval, is usually smaller than the larvae, and do not have setae. The first documented case of papular urticaria was caused by the larvae. No preference was found for the larvae out of calf meat, chicken meat, and pellet feed for rodents. The pupae may be cannibalized by the larvae. Use in skeleton preparation Dermestes maculatus is the species of carrion beetle typically used by universities and museums to remove the flesh from bones in skeleton preparation. Human and animal skeletons are prepared using this method and the practice has been in use for over 150 years.

High ankle sprains are described as high because they are located above the ankle. They comprise approximately 15% of all ankle sprains. Unlike the common lateral ankle sprains, when ligaments around the ankle are injured through an inward twisting, high ankle sprains are caused when the lower leg and foot externally rotates (twists out). Mechanism of injury The ankle joint consists of the talus resting within the mortise created by the tibia and fibula as previously described. Since the talus is wider anteriorly (in the front) than posteriorly (at the back), as the front of the foot is raised (dorsiflexed) reducing the angle between the foot and lower leg to less than 90¬∞, then the mortise is confronted with an increasingly wider talus. The force is heightened when the foot is simultaneously forced into external rotation (turned outward). This chain of events may occur when the front of a hockey player's skate strikes the boards and the foot is forced outward. It may also occur in football, for example, when a player is on the ground with their leg behind them, the foot at right angles, and a rotational force is suddenly applied to the heel, as when someone falls on their foot. Overall, the most common mechanism is external rotation and may occur with sufficient rapidity that the actual mechanism is unrecognized. In this sequence of events, the most vulnerable structure is the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, uniting the lower end of the tibia and fibula and playing an important role in the maintenance of the mortise. The injury to this ligament may vary from simple stretch to complete rupture. Some restraint to further injury is offered by the structures on the inside of the ankle, the medial malleolus and the medial collateral ligament. However, should these structures fail, then the force will be transmitted beyond the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament to the strong membrane that holds the tibia and fibula together for most of their length. This force may then exit through the upper end of the fibula, creating a so-called Maisonneuve fracture. Diagnosis Those who sustain high ankle sprains usually present with pain in the outside- front of the leg above the ankle, with increased discomfort when twisting (external rotation) is applied. In some cases, the diagnosis is only made after treatment for the more common, lateral, ankle sprain fails.Ankle Syndesmosis Injuries ‚Äì Orthogate ‚Äì Improving orthopedic care, education and research with Internet technologies Diagnosis may also be delayed because swelling is usually minor or nonexistent and the true nature of the injury unappreciated.Syndesmotic Sprain ‚Äì Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics A variety of diagnostic tests have been described such as the 'squeeze' (compressing the tibia and fibula above the midpoint of the calf), 'dorsiflexion with compression' (patient dorsiflexes the foot while the examiner compresses the internal and external malleolus), and 'external rotation' (patient sits with leg dangling and ankle at 90¬∞ and external rotation then applied to the foot) etc. None of them performs sufficiently well to allow diagnosis to be made on the basis of a single test, and is usually made by combining multiple tests supplemented with appropriate imaging when indicated. Plain radiographs, Ultrasound or MRI may be used for diagnosis. In the case of X-rays, demonstration of widening of the tibia and fibula 'mortise', a fracture of the medial malleolus, or a Maisonneuve fracture, will indicate an unstable or potentially unstable injury. However, 'normal' x-rays do not exclude significant ligament injury, and in one study, the ratio of diagnostic X-ray to known syndesmotic injury was only one in 17. By contrast, ultrasound may permit the injury to be visualized while the mortise is being stressed. Consequently, a diagnostic modality such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that demonstrates the ligament itself may be helpful, if clinical suspicion remains. Treatment Treatment depends on severity and convalescence may be as short as a few days or as long as six months. Rest, icing, compression, and elevation is often recommended. Two important issues should be addressed early. First, a determination of whether the ankle is stable or unstable. This is usually answered by clinical assessment together with results of the imaging modalities previously described. In the case of suspected instability, specialist referral is indicated as surgery and some form of internal fixation may be an option, if not a requirement. Second, a decision of degree of weight bearing, if any, to be permitted. The answer to this is partly related to stability, partly to the clinical estimate of ligament injury together with imaging findings, and partly related to discomfort when weight bearing. The final decision is largely individualized depending on the circumstances. An alternative measure consists of H.E.M. (Healthy blood flow, Eliminate swelling and Mobility). This treatment suggests increasing healthy blood flow to the ankle, including immune cells required for healing. The treatment also suggests improving healthy range of motion, stability and strength in the ankle to aid in a full recovery. Recent research suggests that macrophages (immune cells responsible for muscle repair and growth) are necessary for muscle to grow back to its pre-injured state. The H.E.M. ankle rehab treatment suggests not icing the injury, and instead, following more proactive rehab techniques for recovery: \\"when ice is applied to a body part for a prolonged period, nearby lymphatic vessels begin to dramatically increase their permeability (lymphatic vessels are ‚Äòdead-end‚Äô tubes which ordinarily help carry excess tissue fluids back into the cardiovascular system). As lymphatic permeability is enhanced, large amounts of fluid begin to pour from the lymphatics ‚Äòin the wrong direction‚Äô (into the injured area), increasing the amount of local swelling and pressure and potentially contributing to greater pain.\\" Rehabilitation is important. A significant percentage of these sprains also involve medial and/or lateral ankle ligament injury and slow recovery and continuing symptoms are common. However, limiting external rotation to protect healing ligaments is a primary concern and can usually be achieved by short leg casts, walking boots, and custom orthoses. The degree of permitted weight bearing can be individualized dependent on tolerance and those with less injury are able to ambulate with full weight-bearing. Nevertheless, most use crutches to reduce the burden to some extent and those with more discomfort may be limited to \\"toe touch\\" on the affected side for one to two weeks. Some advocate the ability to climb and descend stairs with minimal discomfort as an indication to permit full, or at least progressive, weight-bearing. Early resistance exercise minimizes muscle atrophy and weakness and a variety of exercises‚Äîelastic bands, ankle weights, heel raise exercises‚Äîmay be used in conjunction with a calf stretch. In the early stages, isometric strengthening and electrical stimulation will combat muscle atrophy and developing weakness.

Operating between 1888 and 1970, it served the mines in Broken Hill, and formed the link between the New South Wales Government Railways and the narrow gauge South Australian Railways lines. It was owned and operated by the Silverton Tramway Company (STC). History Sulphide Street station Silverton =Inception= The Silverton Tramway was conceived as a way to transport silver ore from the newly discovered ore deposits at Silverton, to the smelters at Port Pirie, with the line later extended to Broken Hill with the discovery of that field.Silverton Tramway Company NSW Parliament Hansard The need for a private line was in part due to the New South Wales Government refusing to allow the South Australian Railways to extend its line from Port Pirie across the border.A History of Rail in South Australia National Railway Museum The Silverton Tramway Act of 1886 was passed by the New South Wales Government, permitting the narrow gauge line to be built by the STC. The Act also permitted the New South Wales Government to buy out the company and assets after 21 years, provided a payment of 21 times the average of the previous seven years, and that the company could be obliged to alter the track gauge at any time at its own expense. The line was built in twelve months at a cost of ¬£125,000. The contract to build the line was awarded to C&E; Millar, who were building the Peterborough to Cockburn line at the same time. The first train reached Broken Hill on 6 September 1887, with the line officially opened on 12 January 1888 by the Duke of Manchester.Opening of the Broken Hill Tramway Sydney Morning Herald 12 January 1888 Services were initially operated by South Australian Railways Y class locomotives until the STC acquired its own locomotives. In late 1888, a deal was reached for the South Australian Railways to assume responsibility for the main line workings with the STC operating services to the various mines and sidings in Broken Hill. This ceased on 30 June 1893, with the STC once again operating all services. Major traffic on the line included passengers, livestock, bullion, ore and concentrates. In 1913, 844,477 tons of ore and concentrates were carried on the tramway and another 843,307 tons of other goods including coke, coal, timber, crude oil and livestock, and by 1933 twenty steam locomotives were owned by the company, along with 660 goods wagons. A four-road engine shed, 15.24-metre turntable, and small workshop were built just outside Broken Hill at Railway Town. The line had six stations: Cockburn, Burns, Thackaringa, Silverton, Railway Town and Sulphide Street.Port Pirie - Broken Hill Line NSWrail.netSulphide Street Railway Museum 891 ABC Adelaide 2 December 2003 When the New South Wales line opened in 1919, it terminated at a separate station 200 metres to the east. =Gauge Conversion= After the completion of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1937, the Silverton Tramway and the South Australian line to Port Pirie was a missing link in an unbroken Sydney to Perth rail journey (Perth to Kalgoorlie was the other). Moves towards conversion of the line to standard gauge were made with the passing of the Railway Standardisation Agreement Act of 1944, in which the New South Wales Government would acquire the Silverton Tramway Company, then pass it to the South Australian Railways. This agreement lapsed, with a new one made in 1949, in which the Commonwealth Government would be responsible for the acquisition. The New South Wales Government did not wish the company to remain as a main line operator, or to purchase it themselves; while South Australian train crews were not happy to work trains across the state border due to a loss of favourable industrial conditions. When the company purchased its diesel locomotives, a number of structures, including bridges, were modified (loading gauge and axle loading) to carry standard gauge, as the company ordered the wider bogies needed to operate on standard gauge. By 1967, the Silverton Tramway Company had offered to build a standard gauge line for a fixed sum, and transfer the line to New South Wales soon after. This line would have run from Cockburn to Broken Hill on an alignment that had some interaction with the existing Crystal Street station, but the Commonwealth Government rejected it as it wished for the line to be built on a new alignment. =Demise & Preservation= The Silverton Tramway closed on 9 January 1970. The standard gauge line opened on a new alignment which led directly to the New South Wales operated Crystal Street station, taking one year and over $2 million more than if the Silverton proposal was carried out. The Silverton Tramway Company's business was lost to the South Australian Railways, with the company closing its narrow gauge shortline business, and returning the permanent way to the Crown. The STC then reinvented itself as a short haul rail operator, servicing the mining industry in and around Broken Hill with two of the 1961 diesel locomotives. Since 1886 the company had hauled some 90 million tonnes of bulk and general freight and 2.8 million passengers. The Sulphide Street Station (located in Broken Hill), still stands and its premises is the current Railway and Historical Museum. There, historical pieces of the Silverton Tramway are preserved, including rolling stock and memorabilia. Locomotives situated at the premises include a Silverton Tramway W class numbered W24, a Silverton Tramway Y class Y1, and one South Australian Railways T class numbered T181, as well as some rolling stock from the New South Wales Government Railways.

However his eldest son and heir, Sir Richard Sackville, later became 'notorious' for his 'acquisitiveness', and it may thus have been on Richard's initiative that in 1544 Sackville and his son acquired over ¬£900 worth of former monastic lands in Surrey, Sussex and London, selling them for a profit over the succeeding two years. Sackville resided for the latter part of his life at Chiddingly, Sussex, where on 1 July 1556 he made his last will, requesting a requiem Mass at his funeral, and bequeathing money to the poor in five villages in Sussex and Mount Bures in Essex. His household goods at Chiddingly were left to his second wife, Anne, with remainder to his three daughters. He left his wife his livestock as well, together with the effects in his house called Buckhurst at Withyham. As executors he appointed his wife and his son-in-law, Sir Nicholas Pelham. Sackville died 26 September 1557,Attree states that he died on 26 September, while the History of Parliament biography gives the date of his death as 27 September. and was buried in the parish church at Withyham on 5 October. For reasons which are unclear, Sackville omitted all mention in his will of his eldest son and heir, Sir Richard Sackville. Sir Richard challenged the will, and was granted administration by the court in October 1559. Marriages and issue Sackville married firstly, by 1507, Margaret Boleyn, the daughter of Sir William Boleyn of Blickling and Margaret Ormond (otherwise Butler) (d. before 20 March 1540), daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond (died 3 August 1515), by his first wife, Anne Hankford. Margaret's brother, Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, was the father of King Henry VIII's second queen, Anne Boleyn, and Margaret was thus an aunt of Queen Anne and a great-aunt of Queen Elizabeth I.. John Sackville and Margaret Boleyn had three sons and three daughters: * Sir Richard Sackville (c.1507‚Äì 21 April 1566) of Ashburnham and Buckhurst, Sussex, who married Winifred Brydges (d.1586), daughter of Sir John Brydges, draper, Lord Mayor of London in 1520, and his wife, Agnes Ayloffe.. They had a son Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, and a daughter, Anne Sackville (d. 14 May 1595), who married Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre (1539‚Äì1594).; . * Christopher Sackville (c.1519‚Äì1558/9), who married, by 1541, Constance Culpeper, the daughter of Thomas Culpeper of Bedgebury, Kent, by whom he had at least two sons and a daughter. * John Sackville (by 1523‚Äì1547x52). * Isabel Sackville, who married Richard Ashburnham. * Anne Sackville, who married Sir Nicholas Pelham.

They lived on the lower Danube River, in the northwestern Black Sea region (present-day Moldova and central Ukraine), and in the regions around the Don River (in Middle and Southern Russia). They are commonly associated with the archaeological Penkovka culture. First mentioned in the historical record in 518, the Antes invaded the Diocese of Thrace sometime between 533 and 545. Shortly thereafter, they became Byzantine foederati and received gold payments and a fort (named \\"Turris\\" - the Latin word turris means \\"a tower\\") somewhere north of the Danube at a strategically- important location to prevent hostile barbarians from invading Roman lands. Thus from 545 to the 580s, Antean soldiers fought in various Byzantine campaigns. The Pannonian Avars attacked the Antes at the beginning of the 7th century, when the Antes disappeared as a people. Historiography Map of Slavic peoples of the 6th century (by Boris Rybakov) Scholars have studied the Antes since the late 18th century. Based on the literary evidence provided by Procopius (c. 500‚Äì560 CE) and Jordanes (fl. c. 551), the Antes, along with the Sklaveni and the Venethi, have long been viewed as the constituent proto- Slavic peoples ancestral to both medieval Slavic ethnicities and modern Slavic nations. At times, debate over the origins and the descendants of the Antes has been heated. The tribe has been variously regarded as the ancestors of, specifically, the Vyatichi or the Rus (from a medieval perspective), and, in terms of extant populations, of the Ukrainians versus other East Slavs. Additionally, South Slavic historians have regarded the Antes as the ancestors of the eastern South Slavs. Ethnolinguistic affinities Although the Antes are regarded as a predominantly Slavic tribal union, numerous other theories of their ethnic components have arisen. The origins of their core ruling class have drawn particular attention, including theories that this ruling nobility was ethnically Iranic, Gothic, Slavic, or some mixture thereof. Much of this dispute has arisen from the scantness of the literary evidence: little is known of the Antes apart from the tribal name itself and a handful of anthroponyms. The name Antes itself does not appear to be Slavic, and is often held to be an Iranian word. Omeljan Pritsak, citing Max Vasmer, argues that because anta- means \\"frontier, end\\" in Sanskrit, *ant-ya could mean \\"frontiersman\\" or \\"that which is at the end\\"; and in Ossetian att'iya means \\"the last, behind\\". F.P. Filin and Oleg Trubachyov. shared this opinion. In contrast, Bohdan Struminskyj considered the etymology of Antes to be unproven and \\"irrelevant\\". Struminskyj analyzed the personal names of Antean chiefs and offered Germanic etymological alternatives to the commonly accepted Slavic etymologies that had first been proposed by Stanis≈Çaw Rospond. Although the first unequivocal attestation of the Antes tribe is from the 6th century CE, scholars have tried to connect the Antes with a tribe rendered as An-tsai in a 2nd-century-BCE Chinese source (Hou Han-shu, 118, fol. 13r). Pliny the Elder (Natural History VI, 35) mentions some Anti living near the shores of the Azov Sea, and inscriptions from the Kerch peninsula dating to the 3rd century CE bear the word antas. Based on documentation of \\"Sarmatian\\" tribes inhabiting the north Pontic region during the early centuries of the Common Era, presumed Iranic loanwords in Slavic languages, and Sarmatian \\"cultural borrowings\\" into the Penkovka culture, scholars such as Paul Robert Magocsi, Valentin Sedov, and John V.A. Fine, Jr. maintain earlier proposals by Soviet-era scholars such as Boris Rybakov, that the Antes were originally a Sarmatian‚ÄìAlan frontier tribe that become Slavicized but preserved their name. Sedov argues that the ethnonym referred to the Slavic‚ÄìScythian‚ÄìSarmatian population living between the Dniester and Dnieper Rivers, and later to the related Slavic tribes who emerged from this Slavic‚ÄìIranian symbiosis. However, more-recent perspectives view the tribal entities named by Graeco-Roman sources as fluctuant political formations that were, above all, etic categorizations based on ethnographic stereotypes rather than on first-hand, accurate knowledge of the barbarian language or \\"culture.\\" Bart≈Çomiej Szymon Szmoniewski argues that the Antes were not a \\"discrete, ethnically homogeneous entity\\" but rather \\"a highly complex political reality\\". Linguistically, contemporary evidence suggests that Proto-Slavic was the common language of an area that extended from the eastern Alps to the Black Sea and was spoken by peoples of varying ethnic backgrounds, including Slavs, provincial Romans, Germanic tribes (such as the Gepids and Lombards), and Turkic peoples (such as the Avars and Bulgars). It has further been proposed that the Sklaveni were not distinguished from others on the basis of language or culture but on that of military organization. Compared with the Avars, or 6th-century Goths, the Sklaveni were composed of numerous, smaller disunited groups, one of which ‚Äì the Antai ‚Äì became foederati constituted by a treaty. History The Political Situation in S.E.E. ~ 520 AD ‚Äì the post-Hun period and prior to Byzantine re-conquest of Gothic Italy Map showing the State of the Antes in the 6th century (around 560), according to the book of Francis Dvornik. =Early history= According to historians who argue for a connection between the Antes and the Sarmatians, the Antes were a subgroup of the Alans, who dominated the Black Sea and North Caucasus region during the Late Sarmatian Period. The Antes were based between the Prut and lower Dniester in the 1st‚Äì2nd centuries CE. In the 4th century, their center of power shifted northward toward the southern Bug. In the 5th and 6th centuries, they settled in Volhynia and subsequently in the middle Dnieper region near the present-day city of Kiev. As they moved north from the open steppe to the forest steppe, they organized the Slavic tribes, and the name Antes came to be used for the mixed Slavo‚ÄìAlanic polity.Today Alans are better known as Ossetians. Whatever the exact origins of the tribe, Jordanes and Procopius appear to suggest that the Antes were Slavic by the 5th century. In describing the lands of Scythia (Getica. 35), Jordanes states that \\"the populous race of the Venethi occupy a great expanse of land. Though their names are now dispersed amid various clans and places, yet they are chiefly called Sklaveni and Antes.\\" Later, in describing the deeds of Ermanaric, the mythical Ostrogothic king, Jordanes writes that the Venethi \\"have now three names: Venethi, Antes, and Sklaveni\\" (Get. 119'). Finally, he describes a battle between the Antean king Boz and Ermanaric's successor Vinitharius after the latter's subjugation by the Huns. After initially defeating the Goths, the Antes lost the second battle, and Boz and 70 of his leading nobles were crucified (Get. 247). Scholars have traditionally taken the accounts of Jordanes as face-value evidence that the Sklaveni and (the bulk of the) Antes descended from the Venedi, a tribe known to historians such as Tacitus, Ptolemy, and Pliny the Elder since the 2nd century CE. However, the utility of Getica as an accurate work of ethnography has been questioned. Walter Goffart, for example, argues that Getica created an entirely mythical story of Gothic and other peoples' origins.The very purpose of Jordanes' narrative, especially with regard to the alleged Scandinavian origin of the Goths, was to show that there was no place for the Goths in Roman territory. Together with his enumeration of other barbarian tribes in Scythia and around Dacia, Jordanes was stating that Scythia is overpopulated with barbarians, and the Goths should belong to the frozen wastelands of the North. Jordanes only feigned his own Gothic roots, and his work is designed to celebrate the destruction of the Gothic kingdom by the Byzantines. (Goffart, 2006) Florin Curta further argues that Jordanes had no real ethnographic knowledge of \\"Scythia,\\" despite claims that he himself was a Goth and was born in Thrace. He borrowed heavily from earlier historians and only artificially linked the 6th-century Sklaveni and Antes with the earlier Venethi, who had otherwise long disappeared by that century. This anachronism was paired with a \\"modernizing narrative strategy\\" whereby Jordanes retold older events ‚Äì the war between the Ostrogothic Vithimiris and the Alans ‚Äì as a war between Vinitharius and the contemporary Antes. In any case, no 4th-century source mentions the Antes, and the \\"Ostrogoths\\" did not form until the 5th century ‚Äì inside the Balkans.Heather, The Goths 52‚Äì55. Kulikowski 111. Apart from the influence of older historians, Jordanes' narrative style was shaped by his polemical debate with his contemporary Procopius. While Jordanes linked the Sclaveni and Antes with the ancient Venedi, Procopius states that they were both once called Sporoi (Procopius. History of the Wars. VII 14.29).The term Spori is a hapax, but might have been inspired by the tribe \\"Spali\\" (curta, 1999. FN 36) =Location in 6th century= A golden buckle from the √ñdenkirche plot grave field at Keszthely-Fen√©kpuszta, Zala County, Hungary; on the underside is the Greek inscription ANTIKOY, \\"conqueror of the Antes\\". Jordanes and Procopius have been seen as invaluable sources in locating the Antes with greater precision. Jordanes (Get. 25) states that they dwelt \\"along the curve of the Black Sea\\" from the Dniester to the Dnieper. Paul M. Barford questions whether this implies they occupied the steppe or the regions further north, although most scholars generally place the Antes in the forest steppe zone of Right-bank Ukraine. In contrast, Procopius locates them just beyond the northern banks of the Danube (Wars V 27.1‚Äì2) (i.e., Wallachia). The lack of consistency in geography demonstrates that the Antes stretched well across Sarmatian Scythia, rather than being a small and distant polity.Eg Jordanes states Scythia extends as far as the \\"Tyras\\" and \\"Danaster\\", although they are two names for the same river (Dniester). Procopius thought the Caucasus mountains extended as far as Illyricum. (Curta, 199, p. 327-8) =6th and 7th centuries= The first contact between the Eastern Romans and the Antes was in 518 CE. Recorded by Procopius (Wars VII 40.5‚Äì6), the Antean raid appeared to coincide with the Vitalian' revolt, but was intercepted and defeated by the magister militum per Thraciam Germanus. Germanus was replaced by Chilbudius in the early 530s, who was killed three years later during an expedition against the various Sklavenoi. With the death of Chilbudius, Justinian appears to have changed his policy against Slavic barbarians from offense to defense, exemplified by his grand program of refortifying garrisons along the Danube.Curta, 2001. p. 78 Procopius notes that in 539‚Äì40, the Sklavenes and Antes \\"became hostile to one another and engaged in battle,\\"Procopius Wars VII 14.7‚Äì10 probably encouraged by the Romans' traditional tactic of \\"divide and conquer.\\" At the same time, the Romans recruited mounted mercenaries from both groups to aid their war against the Ostrogoths. Nevertheless, both Procopius and Jordanes report numerous raids by \\"Huns,\\" Slavs, Bulgars, and Antes in the years 539‚Äì40 CE, reporting that some 32 forts and 120,000 Roman prisoners were captured.Curta, 2001. Pg 78-9 Sometime between 533 and 545, the Antes invaded the Diocese of Thrace, enslaving many Romans and taking them north of the Danube to the Antean homelands.Procopius Wars VII.14.11 Indeed, numerous raids were conducted during this turbulent decade by numerous barbarian groups, including the Antes. Shortly afterward, the Antes became Roman allies (after approaching the Romans) and were given gold payments and a fort named \\"Turris\\" somewhere north of the Danube at a strategically important location, in order to prevent hostile barbarians invading Roman lands.Curta, 2001. Pg 80-1 This was part of a larger set of alliances, including the Lombards, lifting pressure off the lower Danube and enabling forces to be diverted to Italy. Thus, in 545, Antean soldiers were fighting in Lucania against Ostrogoths, and in the 580s they attacked the settlements of the Sklavenes at the behest of the Romans. In 555 and 556, Dabragezas (of Antean origin) led the Roman fleet in Crimea against Persian positions.Agathias. III 6.9; 7.2; 21.6 The Antes remained Roman allies until their demise in the first decade of the 7th century. They were often involved in conflicts with the Avars, such as the war recorded by Menander the Guardsman (50, frg 5.3.17‚Äì21) in the 560s. In 602, in retaliation for a Roman attack on their Sklavene allies, the Avars sent their general Apsich to \\"destroy the nation of the Antes.\\"Theophylact Simocatta VII 15.12‚Äì14 Despite numerous defections to the Romans during the campaign, the Avar attack appears to have ended the Antean polity. They never again appear in sources, apart from the epithet Anticus in the imperial titulature in 612. Curta argues that the 602 attack on the Antes destroyed their political independence.Curta, 2001. Pg 105 However, based on the aforementioned attestation of Anticus, Georgios Kardaras rather argues that the disappearance of the Antes stemmed from the general collapse of the Scythian/lower Danubian limes they defended, ending their hegemony on the lower Danube.Kardaras, 2010. p. 85 Other considered a remote connection between the Antes and the Primary Chronicle narrative in which is mentioned oppression of the Dulebes by the Avars, and the tradition recorded by Al-Masudi and Abraham ben Jacob that in ancient times the WalitƒÅbƒÅ (which some read as Walƒ´nƒÅnƒÅ and identified with the Volhynians) were \\"the original, pure-blooded Saqaliba, the most highly honoured\\" and dominated the rest of the Slavic tribes, but due to \\"dissent\\" their \\"original organization was destroyed\\" and \\"the people divided into factions, each of them ruled by their own king\\", implying existence of a Slavic federation which perished after the attack of the Avars. Whatever the case, shortly after the collapse of the Danubian limes (more specifically, the tactical Roman withdrawal), the first evidence of Slavic settlement in northeastern Bulgaria begin to appear. The Pereshchepina hoard, dating to the early 7th century, may be considered part of an Antean chieftain's treasury, although most researchers consider it to be the treasure of Khan Kubrat, the first ruler of Old Great Bulgaria.Pereshchepina Treasure at the Hermitage Museum.

Thailand is home to the third largest ethnic Malay population after Malaysia and Indonesia and most Malays are concentrated in the Southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Songkhla and Satun. Phuketphuket1.xlsDescendants of the White- Blooded Lady and Ranong,ranong1.xls home to a sizeable Muslim population, also have many people who are of Malay descent. A sizeable community also exists in Thailand's capital Bangkok, having descended from migrants or deportees who were relocated from the South from the 13th century onwards.  Cultural distinctiveness  Separatist inclinations among ethnic Malays in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Songkhla provinces, the cause of the Southern Thai insurgency, are due in part to cultural differences from the Thai people as well as past experiences of forced attempts to assimilate them into Thai mainstream culture after the annexation of the Sultanate of Patani by the Sukhothai Kingdom. In 1816, Siam divided the Muslim tributary Sultanate of Patani into seven provinces as part of a policy of 'divide and rule'. Despite occasional subsequent rebellions, the policy was generally successful in ensuring peace until the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1901, Siam restructured the seven provinces into a single administrative unit, 'Monthon Pathani', under the new Ministry of the Interior, which consolidated the seven provinces into four: Patani, Bangnara, Saiburi, and Yala. Kedah was then ceded to the English under the Anglo‚ÄìSiamese Treaty of 1909, in which a more integrated district formerly belonging to Kedah became Satun Province. The Malay Muslims of Satun are less inclined towards separatism; this is largely a result of the historical affinity of the Malay King of Setul towards Siam, compared to the violent breakup of the Sultanate of Patani. Pro-Thai inclinations can also be observed in Malay communities in Phuket, Ranong and Bangkok.  Language  The majority of Malays in Thailand speak a distinct variety of Malay known as Pattani Malay (Yawi: Baso Yawi/Pattani). However, not all Thai Malays speak Pattani Malay, some people who live in Satun and neighbouring provinces use another distinct variety of Malay known as Satun Malay, while the Malays up north in Bangkok have developed their distinct variant of Malay that incorporated elements of localism with visible Pattani- Kedahan Malay dialect influences known as Bangkok Malay (Bangkok Malay: Bangkok Melayu/Nayu). The Bangkok, Kedahan and Pattani are closely related and shared many similar vocabularies but still mutually partly unintelligible. Majority of Malays ethnics in Satun (but also a significant minority in Phatthalung Trang, Krabi, Phang Nga and Songkhla as well as in the Malaysian states of Kedah, Perak and Perlis) are a distinct ethnic group who generally adhere to Islam, but are Thai identity (although with some Malay influences) and speak a Southern Thai interspersed with some Malay loanwords. = Writing system = With the introduction of Islam to Southeast Asia, the Malays use a modified version of the Arabic script known as Jawi. Unlike other parts of the Malay world, like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, where the usage of Jawi is declining rapidly from the increasing usage of the Latin alphabet, Jawi is still widely used and understood among Malays in Thailand.  Religion  Thai Malays in 2011 A vast majority of Thai Malays are Muslims of Shafi'i sect, with Islam as the defining element of the Thai Malay identity.

The concept was explored in detail by the 1989 Microwave Power Module Panel, supported by the US Naval Research Laboratory. While the eventual goal was to design a power module with a cross section as small as a half square inch, most MPMs today are larger, and suitable only for line arrays, partially distributed arrays and single-module applications. Typical Specifications Microwave power modules are available at various frequencies, from S band up to W band. Both CW and pulsed MPMs are available, the pulsed MPMs having a wide duty cycle range. Power levels range from less than 20W to over 1 kW. MPMs are light-weight compared to traditional TWTAs, and the power supply requirements are typically low-voltage DC (28 - 270V DC). Construction Block diagram of an MPM A microwave power module consists of a solid state power amplifier, which drives a vacuum power booster, typically a traveling wave tube. The high voltage power supply required by the TWT is provided by an electronic power conditioner. In pulsed-mode MPMs, the power conditioner provides a pulsed high voltage that is triggered by a trigger input. MPMs also include a microcontroller, which is responsible for controlling the operation of the module, such as making sure the various power supply voltages come up in the appropriate sequence to prevent damage to the TWT. It also reports the module status, including the various voltages, currents and temperatures.

It is located south of Putra Heights, UEP Subang Jaya and Puchong, along the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway Central Link. Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) are to the east and south, and Jenjarom and Teluk Panglima Garang to the west. This township is under the administration of the Kuala Langat Municipal Council (MPKL) unlike its closest neighbors, Putra Heights and Kampung Bukit Lanchong which are under the jurisdiction of the Subang Jaya City Council (MBSJ) and Taman Mas / Taman Putra Prima / Taman Putra Perdana, Puchong which is under the jurisdiction of the Sepang Municipal Council (MPSepang). Location, Area Description and Demographic Bandar Saujana Putra is an 850 acres township developed by LBS Bina Berhad in 2003. It is estimated that 20,000 residents live in the township following the completion of 6,000 units. Saujana Business Park, BSP Village and Saujana Avenue are the only commercial developments that have many amenities to serve the residents of Bandar Saujana Putra, while hospitals, hypermarkets and shopping malls are currently under construction. The latest commercial development in the area is Main Place in USJ 21, UEP Subang Jaya. There are more shopping options in adjacent townships like USJ, Putra Heights, Cyberjaya and Puchong. It is only a mere 35 minutes ride to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Bandar Saujana Putra. Putra Heights / Alam Megah (Shah Alam) is just one exit away on the ELITE expressway and it is only a 12 to 15 km ride to major townships such as Puchong, UEP Subang Jaya (USJ), Cyberjaya, as well as the federal administrative capital of Putrajaya. However, due to long delay of flyover construction and single access road, this township experienced heavy traffic jams during peak hours from 6:30am‚Äì9:00am and 5:00pm‚Äì7:30pm. There were plans in 2017 for a flyover to be built but due to disagreements between the developers - the proposal has been delayed until 2019. On 12 April 2019, after the intervention of the Selangor Mentri Besar, Amirudin Shari residents of Bandar Saujana Putra are able to breathe a sigh of relief after their plight to ease the traffic congestion have been considered - a proposed flyover between the South Central Highway (Elite) and the South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE) will be constructed in the Q3 of 2019. The construction of the flyover was signed by Seribu Baiduri Sdn Bhd (LBS Bina Group Berhad) with Permodalan Negeri Selangor Berhad (PNSB). Seribu Baiduri had submitted approval for the flyover construction approval to the Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM). As a result of discussions between both parties, the developer has finally made a commitment to hasten the tender process to implement the flyover. As of 2019, Bandar Saujana Putra consists of 13,000 housing units with a density of 65,000 people. Schools and universities MAHSA International School and MAHSA University is the only school serving in this township. However, there are nearby schools and universities in Puchong, Shah Alam, UEP Subang Jaya, Kuala Langat, Putra Heights, Putrajaya and Cyberjaya, a 15 to 20 minute drive from the township. =Universities= *Multimedia University (Cyberjaya) *Limkokwing University of Creative Technology (Cyberjaya) *Heriot-Watt University (Putrajaya) *MAHSA University (SP2, Bandar Saujana Putra) =Government schools= *SK Alam Megah 1, 2 & 3 (Section 27 & 28, Shah Alam) *SMK Alam Megah 1 & 2 (Section 27 & 28, Shah Alam) *SK Seksyen 27 (Section 27 & 28, Shah Alam) *SK Taman Putra Perdana 1 & 2 (Puchong) *SMK Putra Perdana (Puchong) *SK USJ 2, 6 & 20 (UEP Subang Jaya) *SMK USJ 4, 8, 12, 13 & 23 (UEP Subang Jaya) *Sekolah Wawasan USJ 15 (UEP Subang Jaya) *SJK (C) Chee Wen, USJ 1 (UEP Subang Jaya) *SK Jenjarom (Jenjarom) *SMK Jenjarom (Jenjarom) *SMK Puchong Utama 1 & 2 (Puchong) *SK Pulau Meranti (Puchong) *SMK Puchong Batu 14 (Puchong) *Sekolah Rendah Agama Desa Ayer Hitam (Puchong) *SMK Cyberjaya (Cyberjaya) *SRJK (C) Tun Tan Siew Sin (Putra Heights) *SK Putra Heights 2 (Putra Heights) =International schools= *Taylor's International School (Puchong) *Kingsley International School (Putra Heights) *Nexus International School (Putrajaya) *Korean School of Malaysia (Cyberjaya) *MAHSA International School (SP1, Bandar Saujana Putra) *Oasis International School (Bandar Rimbayu)  Transport  =Expressways, Highways and Roads= Bandar Saujana Putra is central and connects to other major cities in the Klang Valley through the four major expressways ‚Äì namely North‚ÄìSouth Expressway Central Link (ELITE), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE), Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS) and Damansara‚ÄìPuchong Expressway (LDP).

It was continuously in print for 70 years after its initial publicationRegaignon, 84. and was translated into French, German, Spanish, Hindustani (1814; 1873), Chinese, Marathi (1853), Tamil (1840), and Sinhalese.Demers; Regaignon, 91, n. 4. Telling the story of a young British boy who, on his deathbed, converts Boosy, the Indian man who has taken care of him throughout his childhood, the book is dominated by colonial and evangelical themes. Style Sherwood's tale blends the realistic with the sentimental and introduces her readers to Hindustani words and descriptions of what she felt was authentic Indian life.Cutt, 17-18. As children's literature scholar M. Nancy Cutt explains, \\"with this work, the obituary tract (which invariably stressed conversion and a Christian death) had assumed the colouring of romance\\". Themes Frontispiece to a later edition of The History of Little Henry and his Bearer (c. 1830). In 1823 Sherwood published a female version of the story entitled The History of Little Lucy and her Dhaye, although this tale was much less popular than Little Henry, going through only four editions.Regaignon, 92, n. 11. In both books she \\"presents the children's intimacy with and love for their Indian caretakers as an early impediment to their development of a strong English identity; she then offers Evangelical Anglican Christianity, with its emphasis on the missionary impulse to convert others, as a solution to that problem\\". As Dara Regaignon explains, in the two stories \\"conversion 'saves' Henry and Lucy by teaching them that some religions and cultures are right while others are wrong\\" and the two children end up \\"civilizing\\" their caretakers. Sherwood ties together British identity with Christianity. For example, at the beginning of Little Henry, Henry can only speak Hindustani, but as he learns English he also learns the doctrines of Christianity--\\"the two are identified with one another entirely: the English language is the medium of the Christian education\\". When Henry in turn teaches Boosy to read English, he also converts him to Christianity.Regaignon, 88. Threatened by the specter of European children in India being raised by Indian \\"bearers\\" and \\"dhayes\\", Regaignon argues, Sherwood provides her readers with stories showing the hero and heroine drawing strength and ultimately domination over their caretakers from those very ties--\\"in Sherwood's hands, threats to imperial identity ultimately reinforce it.\\" Both Henry and Lucy teach their caretakers, reversing the power dynamic initially established in the story. Henry even turns into a Christ figure, sacrificing his life for Boosy's conversion.Regaignon, 91. In addition, Sherwood's \\"stories are meant to inspire their readers to missionary action\\". In Little Henry, Henry's death is what prompts Boosy's conversion. The last line of the book urges its readers to follow Henry's example: \\"Little children in India, remember Henry L--, and go and do likewise\\" (emphasis in original).Qtd. in Regaignon, 85. However, as Regaignon argues, Henry's conversion is also \\"a kind of synecdoche for the shift of British imperial attitudes from orientalism to anglicization that occurred in the first decades of the nineteenth century\\".Regaignon, 89. At the time that Little Henry was published, evangelicals were gaining political influence in Britain; Warren Hastings, the former governor-general of India, had just been impeached; and the Charter Act of 1813 allowed for the beginning of missionary activities in India. Not only were its readers receptive to its message, it helped to make the conviction that the spreading of Christianity \\"was a matter of moral truth appealing and persuasive to generations of children\\". Using a postcolonial analysis, Nandini Bhattacharya emphasizes the complex relationship between Sherwood's evangelicalism and her colonialism. She argues that Sherwood's evangelical stories demonstrate the deep colonial \\"mistrust of feminized agency,\\" represented by a dying child in Little Henry and his Bearer. Henry \\"subvert[s] the colonialist's fantasy of universal identity by generating a subaltern identity that mimics and explodes that fantasy.\\" But, ultimately, Bhattacharya argues, Sherwood creates neither a completely colonialist text nor a subaltern text; the deaths of children such as Henry eliminate any possibility for an alternative consciousnesses to mature.Bhattacharya, 383. Publication history Written in 1810 when Sherwood was living in India and published in England in 1814, Little Henry went through 18 printings between 1814 and 1824 alone. It appeared every three years (on average) until 1883. The book was also popular in the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century, until 1852 when Uncle Tom's Cabin superseded it. One scholar has suggested that Harriet Beecher Stowe used Henry as a model for \\"Little Eva\\" in her novel, but Regaignon argues that racial histories underlying the two countries are too different for this influence to make much sense. In 1842 Sherwood published The Last Days of Boosy, a sequel to Little Henry. As Regaignon explains, it is \\"markedly different\\" in \\"style, tone, and doctrine\\" from the previous book. It does not cite the Bible as frequently and God is depicted much less sternly. While Little Henry is part of what Cutt has referred to as Sherwood's \\"Evangelical period\\", The Last Days of Boosy is not.Regaignon, 93, n. 25.

He enjoyed brief fame as a prolific leading man of Spaghetti Westerns before dying at the age of 30. Biography He lived in Nice for several years with his mother and then in Rome (Italy) with his wife and son. He was also cast in photonovels under the name Pierre Cl√©ment. His first notable film role was a small, uncredited, but important appearance as the brother-in-law of Lee Van Cleef in For a Few Dollars More. From then on he went on to star in 16 more Spaghetti Westerns from 1967 to 1973. He was also credited in several of these films as Arthur Grant. Some of these films were hits in Europe including Killer Caliber .32 (1967), Day of Violence (1967), Fury of Johnny Kid (1967), The Man Who Killed Billy the Kid (1967), Killer Adios (1968). He was a particularly popular actor in Cuba. In 1971, Lawrence had a supporting role in Black Beauty. He continued acting until his death. He had 30 film credits in his nine-year career. His last credited appearance was Los Caballeros del Bot√≥n de Ancla (1974). Death He met actress Cristina Galb√≥ during the filming of Dove si spara di pi√π in 1967, and they married two years later on 30 July 1969 until his death. In 1972 Lawrence began suffering from headaches. Once filming finished on Los Caballeros del Bot√≥n de Ancla, he was admitted to the Foundation Jimenez Diaz Hospital in Madrid, where he was operated on by Dr. Sixto Obrador. The surgery was a success, but the biopsy report revealed it was glioblastoma. He moved to Zurich, where, under the auspices of Professor Wolfgang Horst, he began both chemo and radium treatment. On March 25, 1974, Lawrence was admitted to the Villa Stuart Clinic in Rome with severe stomach pains. He died on a Saturday, April 20, 1974, at ten past three in the morning.

The Peninsula runs in the north west to south east direction and is approximately 55 km long. The width varies from about 5.4 km to about 14 km, with the widest part of the peninsula near its southern end. The Tasman Sea is to the west, and the Kaipara Harbour is to the south. The Wairoa River and Kaipara Harbour are to the east. Dargaville and State Highway 12 lie directly to the north east of the peninsula. The mouth of the Kaipara Harbour separates the peninsula from the smaller Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula to the south. The most substantial settlement on the peninsula is Te K≈çpuru. The locality of Pouto, originally a MƒÅori village, is in the south east of the peninsula. Geography and conservation Dune Lake Much of Pouto - over 600 ha - is covered by sand dunes, which are one of the largest unmodified dune systems in New Zealand. Many of the dunes rise over 100 m above sea level, and the highest reaches 214 m. There are also both permanent and temporary wetlands, and more than 20 freshwater lakes and swamps. The interior is planted in exotic forests. Several threatened plants, birds, invertebrates and a freshwater fish are found on the peninsula. Shipwrecks Kaipara North Head Lighthouse There have been 113 recorded shipwrecks on the coast of Pouto, because the low-lying peninsula makes the north head of the Kaipara Harbour treacherous, and there are a lack of landmarks on the peninsula from which to take bearings. Tradition recounts that Rongomai, the captain of the waka MƒÅhuhu, drowned when his canoe capsized near the entrance to Kaipara Harbour in the early days of MƒÅori settlement of New Zealand. The first shipwreck in recorded history was of the Aurora, a 550-ton barque, in 1840,Byrne, pp 170-71 and the most recent was the yacht Aosky in 1994. New Zealand film maker Winston Cowie investigated potential Portuguese or Spanish shipwrecks on the Pouto Peninsula and recorded the oral tradition from interviews on the Iberian discovery question in his books Conquistador Puzzle Trail and Nueva Zelanda, un puzzle hist√≥rico: tras la pista de los conquistadores espa√±oles. Cowie concludes that more research and investigation is required to conclude that any of them are Spanish or Portuguese. The oral tradition of Pouto elders, however, did mention a Spanish ship, helmets, armour in the sand, and buried treasure. History Descendants of the MƒÅhuhu crew settled around Pouto and the South Head of Kaipara Harbour, possibly in the 13th century CE. Some of the crew of Aotea may have joined them in the 14th century. In the 15th century, Taramainuku, a grandson of the Arawa captain, settled at Pouto near the North Head, killing or driving away some of the previous occupants. According to tradition, the greater area of Kaipara is called after a hƒÅngi Taramainuku hosted, at which the para fern (Marattia salicina) was served. (\\"Kai\\" is a MƒÅori language word meaning \\"food\\".) In the late 17th century, or early 18th, NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua occupied the Pouto Peninsula as part of their move southwards.Byrne, pp 4-6 In 1820, during the Musket Wars, NgƒÅ Puhi laid siege to NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua's Tauhara pa near Pouto, but were unable to capture it. A truce was agreed, to be cemented by the marriage of a NgƒÅ Puhi chief to the daughter of a NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua chief. During the festivities, NgƒÅ Puhi and their allies suddenly turned on their hosts and massacred them.Byrne, p 12 Polack erroneously gives the year as 1826. In 1874, a customs house and pilot station were built at Pouto. A signal mast was erected in the sandhills at North Head in 1876, 5‚Äì6 miles west of the station. The following year, a telegraph system was set up between the two.Byrne, pp 247-57; Ryburn, p 44 A lighthouse was built at North Head in 1884. The customs office was shifted to Te K≈çpuru in 1903.Ryburn, p 140-44 The lighthouse was automated in 1947, and closed in the mid 1950s. The structure still exists and was renovated in 1982‚Äì84. Gum-diggers operated on the peninsula from the 1870s and lasting into the 1930s, although kauri trees no longer grew there. Dairy farming was established in the early 20th century.Ryburn, pp 68, 170, 203 Sand from Pouto was used to build dams in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges, and was also barged around the Kaipara Harbour.Ryburn, pp 161-62, 181 The southern part of the peninsula was slow to be developed, with the road only reaching to Taingaehe in 1930, and extending another 35 km to Pouto itself in 1931. Until then, contact with the rest of the world was by steamer. The road wasn't metalled until the 1940s.Ryburn, pp 170, 192 Education Pouto School is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school with a roll of students as of A school was first established at Pouto in 1878.Ryburn, p 48 There is also a primary school at Te K≈çpuru.

In the Republican primary, he faced Eric Zichella, Chris Spencer, and Gerald J. Lefebvre. Florida's New Directions, an organization indirectly affiliated with Hudson, sent out mailers attacking Zichella over his qualifications, declaring that the resume \\"he's peddling as a candidate for state representative is so inflated, it's about to blow up in his face.\\" Hudson narrowly defeated his opponents in the primary, winning 37% of the vote to Zichella's 33%, Spencer's 28%, and Lefebvre's 2%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Linda McDonald, the Democratic nominee and a public school teacher in Naples. The Florida Democratic Party targeted the district, urging attendees at their annual convention to contribute to McDonald's campaign and featuring her as a speaker. During the course of the campaign, Hudson earned the endorsement of the Naples Daily News, which noted, \\"We have long been impressed by Hudson's immersion in business and civic affairs and youth sports, usually in leadership roles,\\" and questioned whether McDonald was more suited for the school board. In the end, Hudson ended up defeating McDonald, winning 56% of the vote to McDonald's 44%. Running for re-election in 2008, Hudson was opposed by Maria Jimenez, a charter schools official at the Redlands Christian Migrant Association and the Democratic nominee.

Hudson ended up narrowly won re-election over Jimenez, winning 53% of the vote to her 47%. When he ran for re-election in 2010, he faced only independent candidate Larry Wilcoxson, whom he was able to defeat in a landslide with 69% of the vote.

Early life Roosevelt was born on November 10, 1800 in New York City on Warren Street near Broadway. He was the son of Catherine (n√©e Byvanck) (d. 1854) and James Christopher Roosevelt (1770‚Äì1840). A member of the Roosevelt family, his paternal grandfather was Christopher Roosevelt (b. 1739), the brother of Isaac Roosevelt, 2nd President of the Bank of New York. He was a third cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandfather and second cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's grandfather. Education and life Roosevelt graduated from Columbia College in 1819 and studied law at Harvard University, but was unable to practice due to delicate health, possibly resulting from polio. Confined largely to his home he was forced to abandon the law and break off his engagement to Miss Julia Boardman, who was also from a good New York family. He lived off of a modest inheritance and expanded it through prudent investments and simple living. Roosevelt died on November 30, 1863 in New York City. He was first buried at the New York City Marble Cemetery, and later, his remains were moved to the Roosevelt Hospital grounds in 1876. His body was again moved in 1994 and re-interred at the Marble Cemetery. =Legacy= His will left most of his estate, including property worth nearly $1 million, to found Roosevelt Hospital, which was opened on November 2, 1871. Under the terms of his will, the hospital was to be a voluntary hospital that cared for individuals regardless of their ability to pay.

It was associated with Emcee Africa - The Battle Chronicles, a talent show televising the competition. It was a continent-wide search for the premier freestyle MC/Rapper. The tour started in Accra, Ghana, and then went through Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, Nairobi, Kenya, Luanda, Angola, Lagos, Nigeria and Johannesburg, South Africa.Africanhiphop.com :: African Rap :: 10 years online Gaborone, Botswana was included in the second season, while Luanda, Angola and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania were cut from the tour. The motive of the tour was not only to find the best freestyle MC, but to initiate international awareness of the 'street life' surrounding social and cultural context of the localized music. In other words, the tour was attempting to better contextualize the application and reception of hip hop culture in each visited country. The winner received $10,000, a video and a song deal. Format and rules The first season of Emcee Africa followed the host Leslie 'Lee' Kasumba to the various host cities, where the local MC/Rapper's were invited to an audition. The final eight MC's were selected to face off in a knockout competition to determine the winner. During the auditions, each performer had two minutes to prove their candidacy for the final eight to a panel of judges. A topic was given to each contender to Freestyle about in order to ensure each contestant was truly improvising and not using any written material. After eight contestants were selected from each country, a separate contest was held, where the eight members would face off to battle each other in two 30 second parts, divided into 2 rounds, followed by the Final. The winner from each country was then flown into Johannesburg to compete for the \\"Emcee Africa\\" title, as well as the grand prize. A judge from each country's panel was then flown in to ensure neutrality in the final competition. The second season followed a similar format with similar rules, except that ten contenders were selected from the auditions, rather than eight. In the second season, contestants who made it through to the second round did not Battle each other but were rather judged based on a performance. From the performance, the judges panel selected two finalists to face off in a final battle. Wildcard For the Final Battle in the first season, audiences could log into www.channelo.co.za, and vote for their favorite MC/Rapper from the previous competitions, to reappear in the final stages. Host Leslie 'Lee' Kasumba (a top hip hop radio DJ from South Africa's YFM station) is the host. She also corresponds for Africanhiphop.com.

He was president of Roosevelt & Son, the banking firm founded by his father James Alfred Roosevelt. Early life William Emlen Roosevelt was born to James Alfred Roosevelt and Elizabeth Norris Emlen. His maternal grandparents were William Fishbourne Emlen (1786‚Äì1866) and Mary Parker Norris (1791‚Äì1872) and his paternal grandparents were Cornelius Van Schaack Roosevelt (1794‚Äì1871) and Margaret Barnhill (1799‚Äì1861). Career He was director of the Chemical Bank of New York, the Gallatin National Bank, and the Astor National Bank, and later sat on the boards of the Grand Hanover and the Bank of New York. He was president of Roosevelt Hospital, founded by his distant cousin James H. Roosevelt. He was an officer of the National Guard for 16 years, major and quartermaster of the First Brigade. Roosevelt became involved in telecommunications companies, formed the Mexican Telegraph Company and Central and South American Telegraph Company, and was eventually director of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. Theodore Roosevelt and he had a very close relationship as cousins. Emlen was not interested in politics other than to support his cousin's bids for public office, and Theodore, busy with conservation advocacy, had little time to attend to financial matters. Thus, \\"Cousin Emlen\\" was Theodore's financial adviser before, during and after his presidency. Personal life In 1883, he married Christine Griffin Kean (1858‚Äì1936), the sister of John Kean and Hamilton Fish Kean, who both served as United States Senators from New Jersey. They were the parents of: * Christine Kean Roosevelt (1884‚Äì1913), who married James Etter Shelley (1871‚Äì1936), in 1909. * George Emlen Roosevelt (1887‚Äì1963), who married Julia Morris Addison (1888‚Äì1937), the sister of James Thayer Addison in 1914. After her death, he married Mildred Cobb Rich (1895‚Äì1979). * Lucy Margaret Roosevelt (1888‚Äì1914), who died of typhoid after a trip in South America. * John Kean Roosevelt (1889‚Äì1974), who married Elise Annette Weinacht (1896‚Äì1972) in 1916. * Philip James Roosevelt (1892‚Äì1941), who married his cousin, Jean S. Roosevelt, the daughter of John Ellis Roosevelt, in 1925. He also owned the James Alfred Roosevelt Estate at Cove Neck in Nassau County, New York.

Early life and career Hassan was born in Lahore, Pakistan, to an upper-class Sayid Muslim family. Hassan's maternal grandfather was Hakim Ahmad Shuja, a Pakistani poet, writer and playwright. She lived a comfortable childhood, but was affected by the conflict between her father's traditional views and her mother's nonconformism. For most of her life, she hated her father's traditionalism because of his views of sex roles, but she later came to appreciate it because of his kindness and compassion. She attended Cathedral High School, an Anglican missionary school, and later St. Mary's College at Durham University, England, where she studied English and philosophy. She received her Ph.D. from Durham University in 1968 for her thesis on Muhammad Iqbal, who she has written about frequently. She taught at the University of Punjab at Lahore from 1966 to 1967 and worked in Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting from 1969 to 1972. In 1972, she immigrated to the United States with her daughter. She has taught at schools including Oklahoma State University and Harvard University, and is currently a professor of Religious Studies at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. Theology and activism Hassan's theology is an example of Progressive Islam. She says the Qur'an is the \\"Magna Carta of human rights\\", prescribing human rights and equality for all, while the inequality of women in many Muslim societies today is due to cultural effects. Hassan claims the Qur'an upholds rights to life, respect, justice, freedom, knowledge, sustenance, work, and privacy, among others. She supports a non-rigid interpretation of the Qur'an, arguing that while it is the word of God, words can have different meanings, so there are theoretically countless possible meanings of the Qur'an. She believes the meaning of the Qur'an should be determined through hermeneutics ‚Äî examination of what its words meant at the time it was written. She also speaks of an \\"ethical criterion\\" that rejects the use of the Qu'ran to perpetrate injustice, because the God of Islam is just. Hassan supports abortion rights and access to contraceptives for Muslim women, saying that the Qur'an does not directly address contraceptives, but that Islam's religious and ethical framework leads to the conclusion that family planning should be a fundamental right. She says a review of Muslim jurisprudence indicates that abortion has been considered acceptable within the first 120 days of pregnancy, when the fetus has not yet been ensouled. In February 1999, she founded The International Network for the Rights of Female Victims of Violence in Pakistan, which works against so- called honor killings. She has argued that honor killings are a distortion of Islam, and further, that the whole idea that women are inferior is a result of the mistaken belief among Muslims that Eve was created from Adam's rib, when, in the Islamic creation story, they were created at the same time. Hassan is not only a scholar, she is also an activist. In her capacity as an activist, Hassan developed and directed \\"Islamic Life in the U.S.\\" (2002-2006) and \\"Religion and Society: A Dialogue\\" (2006-2009), two peace-building programs which created a standard for interfaith discussion and peace-building, following the 2001 attacks. She also wrote the eleventh chapter of Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion (2004), edited by Ann Braude. Publications Hassan's career includes numerous publications, in which she applies her non-patriarchal interpretation of Islam. One of Hassan‚Äôs publications is her article on Women‚Äôs Rights in Islam: Normative Teachings Versus Practice in which she discusses the rights she has identified for women as instructed by the Qur‚Äôan and how Muslim practices either support or do not support these rights. In this article, she also pays special attention to the relationship between the West and Islam due to the sometimes tense relationship between them. This article identifies the specific rights given to all humankind, some of which include the right to respect, to justice, to acquire knowledge, and to ‚Äúthe Good Life.‚Äù She then draws out the specific issues Muslim women face in practice including marital problems and divorce, polygamy, and segregations and veiling. Taking these specifics, she addresses a case study on Pakistan. She concludes that ‚Äúalthough violations of women‚Äôs rights are widespread in the Muslim world‚Ä¶ the Qur‚Äôan does not discriminate against women‚Äù (57). She ends the article with a push towards the growth of ‚Äúan educated group of persons who understand Islam to be a religion of justice and compassion‚Äù (62). Hassan uses her knowledge of the Quran, women‚Äôs rights and issues, and Pakistan to call for a closer reading of the Quran to serve as the backbone of all practices. =Recent Articles= \\"Woman and Man's Fall: A Quarnic Theological Perspective\\" (2013), Muslima Theology: The Voices of Muslim Women Theologians \\"Human Liberation is Supported by the Holy Qur'an\\" (2007) Women in Religion \\"Islamic Hagar and Her Family\\" (2006) Hagar, Sarah and Their Children \\"Marriage- Islamic Discourses\\" (2005) Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures \\"Women's Rights in Islam: Normative Teachings vs Practice\\" (2005) Islam and Human Rights: Advancing a U.S. - Muslim Dialogue \\"Riffat Hassan: Muslim Feminist Theologian\\" (2004) Transforming the Faith of Our Fathers: Women Who Changed American Religion \\"Rights of Women: Muslim Practice versus Normative Islam\\" (2003) Women's Rights and Islam \\"Islam\\" (2003) Her Voice, Her Faith: Women Speak on World Religions \\"Muslim Women's Rights A Contemporary Debate\\" (2002) Women for Afghan Women: Shattering Myths and Claiming the Future \\"Islam and Human Rights in Pakistan\\" (2002) Canadian Foreign Policy \\"Is Islam a Help or Hindrance to Women's Development?\\" (2002) Islam in the Era of Globalization \\"Equal for Allah, Unequal on Earth?

In the film, a businessman's wife tries to become an opera star, failing miserably due to her lack of talent. When it turns out that her totally untrained husband is found to have a marvelous singing voice and goes on tour under an assumed name, his wife is livid.. Darnell sings long stretches of an imaginary opera, L'Amore di Fatima. The music for it was written by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. In a little tongue-in-cheek detail, the poster for the opera lists Tedesco ‚Äì who wrote real operas ‚Äî as the composer. To add to the illusion of the opera's authenticity, Douglas also sings some known songs, including a musical setting of the Rudyard Kipling poem Mandalay and the Toreador Song from Carmen. The operatic scenes were staged by Vladimir Rosing. The film is a word-for-word remake of 1939's Wife, Husband and Friend, which starred Warner Baxter as Borland, Loretta Young as his wife, and Binnie Barnes as Cecil Carver. Plot Leonard Borland (Paul Douglas) lives and works in New York City as a wrecking contractor, married to socialite Doris (Celeste Holm). Even though ‚Äì according to her husband ‚Äì she has no singing talent, Doris considers herself an aspiring opera singer and regularly pressures Leonard to accompany her to operas. Already dismayed by his father- in-law Major Blair's (Charles Coburn) insistence that Doris take some singing lessons, Leonard becomes further estranged from Doris when her career takes off. Despite financing her recital and arranging an important critic to watch her performance, Doris shows no gratitude. Meanwhile, successful opera singer Cecil Carver (Linda Darnell) is complaining about being unable to locate a suitable baritone for her new production, when she and the critic are suddenly rushed to Doris's opera performance. Cecil is not altogether impressed with the newcomer's talent and invites Leonard to her apartment to share her opinion. The two quickly hit it off and share a passionate kiss. Then, she finds out that Leonard, unlike his wife, has a powerful voice, and immediately assigns him to her production under the name \\"Logan Bennett\\". Doris is too busy training with her mother (Lucile Watson) and vocal coach to note what her husband is up to, and believes that he is on the road for his wrecking work. While on tour, Cecil attempts to seduce him, but Leonard, still much in love with Doris, rejects her. Back in New York, Leonard learns that Doris is now under medical care for shock treatment, caused by a disastrous booking at a movie palace. Even though she decides to give up her musical aspirations, she agrees to guest a cocktail party for celebrities. Noticing Leonard's uncomfortable reaction to Cecil's presence at the party, Doris realizes that she might be her husband's mistress. Cecil is disappointed that Leonard pretends not to know her and assures Doris that she is not attracted to him whatsoever, and only knows him through the opera. The audience, dumbfounded by the revelation that Leonard is an opera singer, demands that he perform at the party. Humiliated by his betrayal, Doris orders Leonard to leave her. A few days later, Leonard resides penniless in a hotel and finds out that Doris currently lives in Palm Beach. Due to financial troubles, Leonard accepts a steady opera job. At his debut, attended by Doris and her parents, he is surprised by sudden stage fright. An irritated Cecil and her assistant give him some pills and a potion, causing him to feel sick, and fall from the stage before the entire audience. Much to the audience's amusement, he misses his cue and screws up the entire production. He ends his embarrassing performance by falling into the orchestra pit, prompting a livid Cecil to order him to leave. Doris, feeling for her estranged husband, rushes backstage to reconcile with him. Returning home, they find out that Leonard has been offered a lucrative wrecking contract.

It involved the heaviest fighting between ethnic Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh since the 1994 ceasefire after the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Armenian sources accused Azerbaijan of trying to take advantage of ongoing unrest in Armenia. Azerbaijani sources blamed Armenia, claiming that the Armenian government was trying to divert attention from internal tensions in Armenia. Following the incident, on March 14 the United Nations General Assembly by a recorded vote of 39 in favour to 7 against adopted Resolution 62/243, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces.General Assembly adopts resolution reaffirming territorial integrity of Azerbaijan... UN.org Background =Nagorno-Karabakh War= During and shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and Azeris were involved in the Nagorno- Karabakh War from February 1988 to May 1994. As the war progressed, the former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan became enveloped in a protracted, undeclared war as Azerbaijan attempted to curb the secessionist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave's parliament voted on February 20, 1988, to unify with Armenia, and the vast majority of the Karabakh population voted in favor of independence in a referendum. The demand to unify with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the Soviet Union's disintegration neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between the two ethnic groups, resulting in claims of ethnic cleansing by all sides. The war was the most destructive ethnic conflict in both terms of lives and property that emerged after the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991.The casualties of the war are conflicting and exact numbers are unknown due to the fact that exact body counts were never properly ascertained by either side or by international organizations. In the initial years of combat, casualties were reported to be much lower than what was later asserted after the war ended. Most sources however place the figures near 25‚Äì35,000. Time Magazine, for example lists the number as at least 35,000 people on both sides . The U.S. State Department and NPR put the numbers slightly lower at around 30,000. There have been subsequent casualties which resulted from the tripping of land mines, often by civilians. Numerous cease fire violations on the borders also result in the deaths of several soldiers each year. Other ethnic conflicts with comparative casualties included the First Chechen War and the civil war in Georgia. The declaration of independence was the final result of a \\"long- standing resentment in the Armenian community of Nagorno Karabakh against serious limitations of its cultural and religious freedom by central Soviet and Azerbaijani authorities,\\" but more importantly, as a territorial conflict regarding the land. As Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union and removed the powers held by the enclave's government, the Armenian majority voted to secede from Azerbaijan, and in the process proclaimed the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.At the time of the dissolution of the USSR, the United States government recognized as legitimate the pre-Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact 1933 borders of the country (the Franklin D. Roosevelt government established diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the end of that year). Because of this, the George H. W. Bush administration openly supported the secession of the Baltic SSRs, but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the rest of the Transcaucasus as internal Soviet affairs. Full-scale fighting erupted in the late winter of 1992. International mediation by several groups including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) failed to bring an end resolution that both sides could work with. In the spring of 1993, Armenian forces captured regions outside the enclave itself, threatening the involvement of other countries in the region. By the cease fire in 1994, the Armenians were in full control of not only the enclave but also approximately 9% of Azerbaijan's territory outside the enclave, which they still control.Using numbers provided by journalist Thomas de Waal for the area of each rayon as well as the area of the Nagorno Karabakh Oblast and the total area of Azerbaijan are (in square kilometres): 1,936, Kelbajar; 1,835, Lachin; 802, Kubatly; 1,050, Jebrail; 707, Zangelan; 842, Aghdam; 462, Fizuli; 75, exclaves; totaling 7,709km2 or 8.9%: de Waal. Black Garden, p. 286. As many as 230,000 Armenians from Azerbaijan and 800,000 Azeris from Armenia and Karabakh have been displaced as a result of the conflict. A Russian-brokered cease fire was signed in May 1994 and peace talks, mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group, have been held ever since by Armenia and Azerbaijan. The ceasefire is self-monitored by the armed forces of the now de facto independent Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and by Azerbaijan. Violations of the cease fire in the form of sporadic shooting incidents have occurred, but the cease fire has largely held.Mutual Recriminations After Karabakh Clash IPWR March 7, 2008 =2008 Armenian presidential election protests= Following the Armenian Presidential Election of 2008, there were a series of mass protests in Yerevan, Armenia alleging electoral fraud. Initially these protests were peaceful though unauthorized by government. They began on February 20 and lasted for 10-days. Despite the urging of the government to stop the unauthorized demonstrations, the protests continued until March 1. On the morning of March 1, police and army troops dispersed the 700‚Äì1,000 persons who remained overnight. At noon on March 1, over ten thousand demonstrators held a protest at the French embassy in Yerevan and over the evening, clashes broke out between protestors and law enforcement. A 20-day state of emergency, including a censure on free press, was declared by the incumbent President Robert Kocharyan. On March 2, the Armenian Army with armoured personnel carriers. Up to 9 people died in clashes between police and protesters: one police officer and eight civilians. Sixteen officers were hospitalized with bullet wounds. On March 4, 2008, the OSCE issued a press release citing the ban on independent news coverage and censorship temporarily imposed by Armenian authorities as contrary to OSCE commitments. In this context, the Armenian side blames Azerbaijan for trying to take advantage of unrest in Armenia. The Azeri side blames Armenia claiming that they are trying to divert attention from problems at home however Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has also said his country is ready to re- take the region by force, and has been buying the military hardware and ammunition to do so. Prelude In a sign of disapproval after the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Azerbaijan's parliament voted to withdraw a 33-strong Azeri peacekeeping team that has been serving there under NATO command since 1999, as a part of Turkish peacekeeping mission. Speaking on March 4, Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev said that Kosovo's independence is \\"emboldening Armenian separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh\\", and that his country was ready to take it back by force. Prior to the skirmishes, Ilham Aliyev had insisted on numerous occasions that his country was ready to re- take the region by force, and had been buying the military hardware and ammunition to do so.Armenian and Azerbaijani Forces Clash The Guardian, AIDA SULTANOVA, March 4, 2008 Aliyev nevertheless expressed hope that Azerbaijan's growing military could nudge talks towards a diplomatic breakthrough: \\"A time will come when the Armenians will agree to that (settlement),\\" he said.Azerbaijan may use force in Karabakh after Kosovo reuters, March 4, 2008 Active stage =Armenian version of events= According to the Armenian side, Azerbaijani forces attacked Armenian positions near the village of Levonarkh in the Mardakert Region of north-eastern Nagorno-Karabakh early March 4, 2008.

Timothy P. Andrews, who served to November 29, 1864. After the death of Colonel Larned, there was considerable pressure for a complete investigation of the problems in the pay department. In 1863, the War Department finally began to check the suitability of deputy paymasters with a physical examination, and tests to evaluate mental and moral fitness. Most paymasters in the field were political appointees and those looking for a safer job away from the front lines. When Brice took charge in 1864, the regulations were finally brought up to date, and officially included the examination of candidates. This took the form of writing a business letter, solving mathematical problems, and knowledge of accounting and pay systems. The statistics of the Pay Department show that during it disbursed $1,100,000,000, with discrepancies of less than one-tenth of one per cent. The overhead cost of paying the troops, including expenses, defalcations and losses of all kinds, was just three-fourths of one per cent of the amount disbursed. General Brice reflected on the massive endeavor of creating a modernized pay department from scratch in 1865: Brice is among the group of capable Washington staff officers who have been largely forgotten by modern historians, even though there was a surprisingly low turnover.Eicher & Eicher, p. 625 While President Abraham Lincoln's created a cabinet of the brightest and most capable minds from a team of his political rivals, Ulysses S.

As an amphibious transport, it is fairly armed for defensive purposes, and carries four 7.62mm general purpose machine guns at the front side decks, and two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons near its two LCVPs. The prime mission of the ship is the direct transport and discharge of liquid and dry cargo to shallow terminal areas, remote under-developed coastlines and on inland waterways. The ship does not require external cranes or port facilities, and even in only four feet of water under full load, the ship is still able to land. This capability expands the choice of landing locations, and at the same time reduces the potential enemy impact on the logistics support operations. The ships have a capacity to transport up to 48 TEU or 2,280 tons vehicles/general cargo, or up to 900 tons on Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS) / amphibious operations.

E. Smith. It was first published in book form in 1951 by Fantasy Press in an edition of 5,096 copies. The novel was originally serialized in the magazine Astounding in 1939. Gray Lensman is the fourth (originally the second) book in the Lensman series and the second to focus on the adventures of Lensman Kimball Kinnison. Plot synopsis The action in Gray Lensman picks up immediately where Galactic Patrol left off, in the middle of the battle to destroy Helmuth's Main Base and, it is hoped, fully end the threat of Boskone. After the base falls, Kinnison finds some clues that lead him to think that Helmuth was perhaps not the head of Boskone after all. The clues lead Kinnison to mount an expedition aboard the newly constructed super-dreadnought Dauntless, into the Second Galaxy where he thinks the true head of Boskone might reside. The Dauntless locates a planet under attack and comes to its aid, destroying the Boskonian forces and discovering that the entire planet is capable of going \\"free\\" (that is, inertialess, the method used in the Lensman books to achieve interstellar and intergalactic space travel). The Lensman returns to the First Galaxy with the space-faring planet and its grateful residents. Kinnison decides that since the Patrol is not yet strong enough to attack the Second Galaxy militarily, he will follow leads to the upper levels of Boskone through the traffic in the illegal drug thionite. The novel then follows Kinnison as he tries to infiltrate the Boskonian drug network. Along the way, Kinnison learns something else new: as a Second Stage Lensman he no longer needs his Lens to do Lensman things such as read minds or communicate telepathically, although he works better while wearing it. Kinnison suffers some setbacks, and has to assume different identities, eventually one requiring him to drink and use drugs. Even though he tries to drink while actually letting the people around him empty the bottles, and uses the least harmful drug he can, it still takes him a while to get over their effects. Eventually he uncovers the information he was looking for: the name and the location of Jalte, the boss of all Boskonian drug traffic in the First Galaxy. There is a minor interlude in which the Delgonian Overlords seem to have returned. Because he had fought the Overlords before, Kinnison is asked to lead the expedition to hunt them down, and the reptilian Worsel comes along. The Delgonians are dispatched in fairly short order, but only after the loss of many good men. Kinnison agonizes over the casualties that they suffered because, although he and Worsel were mentally strong enough to resist the Overlords, his men were not. Realizing that the Patrol will need new and much more powerful weapons before it can take on Boskone in the Second Galaxy, Kinnison convenes 50 of the greatest scientists in the galaxy to work on new weapon-development projects. The weapon they invent, whose theory requires the development of a wholly new mathematics, is called a \\"negasphere\\", composed of something combining the attributes of antimatter and negative matter. It totally consumes absolutely anything it touches, in mutual annihilation. They plan to make a negasphere of planetary dimensions and use it against the leaders of Boskone. Kinnison infiltrates Jalte's base and gets the information he had been hoping for since his trip to the Second Galaxy: the location of the leaders of Boskone, a group made up of members of a race called the Eich. He and Worsel set out on what amounts to an almost suicide mission to infiltrate Jarnevon, the homeworld of the Eich. Kinnison is captured and tortured. Unknown to the Eich, Worsel is hiding close by and finds a way to rescue Kinnison, and they get away. Infected by something that requires the Patrol doctors to amputate all four limbs, blinded, and tortured almost to death, Kinnison is nonetheless saved, but he will most likely be a basket case. Earlier in the book, a Posenian physician called \\"Phillips\\" was financed by the Patrol to try to develop a way to allow higher beings to regenerate body parts in the same way that lower animals (starfish, flatworms, salamanders, etc.) can. When Kinnison was injured, Phillips was ready to try his procedure on humans. It works and Kinnison is brought back to full health. During his convalescence Clarissa MacDougall is again his nurse, and their love grows stronger. He then leads an expedition to destroy Jalte's base, using the negasphere. He continues to the Boskonian home ground in the Second Galaxy, to destroy their fleet and then the Eich's home base using a \\"nutcracker\\"‚Äîa pair of planets with diametrically opposed velocities, released to crush Jarnevon between them. And so pass the Eich and the Council of Boskone. It is thought that finally the long struggle is finished and Civilization is triumphant. Kinnison and MacDougall make plans to get married and the book ends with them walking off, hand in hand, into a bright and happy future.

It is a famous trek in the Karjat area, because of its small height and easy climbing. It is also known as the Fort of Peth because of its vicinity to Peth village at its base. Features There is a small temple and large cave at the base and a chimney like tunnel to the top of the fort. This pinnacle is carved from inside forming a staircase reaching the top. There is a tank of water (rock cut water cistern) at some distance from the cave and another one at the top of the fort. The stone is a single black expanse reaching till the Peth village standing on the fertile soil with abundant natural resources for water and farming. History The cave and the temple carvings date back to the 13th century. Not much is known about the history until the 18th century. In 1684 Aurangjeb sent Abdul Kadir and AlaiBiradkar to capture this fort. After a small skirmish, the fort was captured by Abdul Kadir. Aurangjeb honored Abdul Kadir and renamed this fort as Miftah-ul-Fateh (Key to success). Many attempts were made later to win this fort by the Maratha Army, but they were not successful. In 1716, this cave was captured by the British. On 2 November 1817, it was recaptured by the Marathas under the leadership of Bapurao who was general of Bajirao Peshwa. The fort was recaptured by the British on 30 December 1817, by Captain Brooks. The British had the fort till 1862 as an outpost for vigilance on the surrounding valley and the hills all around it. The locals say that this is not actually a fort but a sort of lighthouse from where the directions were given to know the advancements of the enemy. In fact, it can be called a watch tower to keep a vigil on the Mawal area in the greater province of the Maratha.

He was born in Mirecourt, the son of Fran√ßois Peccatte and the nephew of Dominique Peccatte. He was trained by August Lenoble with whom he later had a partnership which lasted until 1881. The early work includes very individual bows which can be described as of the Peccatte school but many of which have heads modelled somewhat after the early type of bow by Fran√ßois Tourte. In the majority of cases Charles Peccatte signed his bows with his name in full, which is also common practice in his uncle and father‚Äôs work. He differed, however, by signing his bows on both sides of the stick. To sign the sticks in this manner is quite unusual in the history of French bow making. There is a possibility that he may have been trying to differentiate himself from his predecessors by doing so. Charles had a unique way of carving heads. This always gives an incredible impression of strength in comparison to their tiny volume. Yet, the heads of his bows are strong, powerful, yet still complementary to the light, elegant style of that era. His working of the bow sticks left them more rigid, which made them very powerful. Charles worked for Vuillaume, Voirin and Lenoble, before opening own establishment at Paris, 1908. After the death of his Mother, Charles, freed from his ties with Lenoble, moved into his new home and workshop on the Rue de Valois. Here he moved into a more contemporary style of bow making also using different brand stamp. His meritorious bows have received consistent acknowledgement from soloists.\\" (Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers). The chamfer on a Charles Peccatte tends to go a little higher into the throat (or the stick itself) on the audience side of the bow. The reason for the success of the bows of the Peccatte family is their individuality. All the Peccattes emanated a very strong, robust personality. Charles was no exception, keeping certain family traditions alive, such as the ‚Äòwide‚Äô head model. The bows Charles made for J.-B. Vuillaume, closely resemble those made by Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin for Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. C. Peccatte won silver medals at the Antwerp and Paris Expositions Universelles in 1885 and 1889 respectively, and was established on his own at 8 rue de Valois, Paris, by 1885.

International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236 (1955), often referred to as International Boxing Club or just International Boxing, was an antitrust decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 7‚Äì2 margin, the justices ruled that the exemption it had previously upheld for Major League Baseball was peculiar and unique to that sport and that it did not apply to boxing.. Since it met the definition of interstate commerce, the government could therefore proceed with a trial to prove IBCNY and the other defendants had conspired to monopolize the market for championship boxing in the United States. It was the first time another sport had argued it was covered by the same exemption as baseball by virtue of being a professional sport. Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, admitted that it would never have reached the Court but for the baseball exemption, and dissenting justices Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton were unsparing in their criticism of the arbitrary nature of this distinction. The case was remanded for trial, which the government won, forcing the breakup of some of the defendant companies. An appeal of that decision also was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court four years later, upholding the wide discretion and scope of district court judges in shaping remedies for antitrust violations. Background of the case In January 1949 James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, who controlled boxing at several major arenas including Madison Square Garden, Chicago Stadium and Detroit Olympia, paid the recently retired Joe Louis $100,000 for four fighters he managed. They agreed that those fighters would fight it out among themselves for the new heavyweight title, and in return fight only in matches Norris and Wirtz promoted for several years. This gave them an effective monopoly on all major boxing matches save those in the flyweight and bantamweight divisions. From 1949 to 1955 all but two championship fights took place under their control. They also secured exclusive television contracts for twice-weekly fights at the Garden, at a time when boxing was increasingly coming to depend on television revenues. Trial and appeal The Justice Department began investigating for possible antitrust violations and brought the IBCNY to trial in the Southern District of New York under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1953. Before it started, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, citing the Court's recent decision in Toolson v. New York Yankees () to uphold the antitrust exemption granted Major League Baseball in 1922's Federal Baseball Club v. National League (). Like baseball, they reasoned, the interstate travel required to facilitate boxing was incidental to the staging of fights and thus boxing was not subject to antitrust law as it was not interstate commerce.Edmonds, Ed; in Congress and Boxing: A Legislative History, 1960-2003, William Hein & Sons, Buffalo, New York, , 2005, 2. \\"After the district court granted the motion, the United States appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court under the Expediting Act.\\" The district court granted the motion. Immediately afterward, the government appealed the dismissal directly to the Supreme Court under the Expediting Act. Decision Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority. Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton dissented, with Minton signing Frankfurter's opinion as well. =Majority= \\"The question is perhaps a novel one in that this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business\\", Warren wrote. \\"Yet, if it were not for Federal Baseball and Toolson, we think that it would be too clear for dispute that the Government's allegations bring the defendants within the scope of the Act.\\"International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 240‚Äì241. Boxing clearly involved interstate arrangements, he said, particularly with broadcasting involved, and as early as Hart v. B.F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange () the Court had been clear that baseball's antitrust exemption could not be claimed by any other business.International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 242. Prior to the Court's consideration of Toolson, he recalled, Congress had considered and rejected other bills intended specifically to genericize the baseball exemption. \\"The issue confronting us is therefore not whether a previously granted exemption should continue,\\" he concluded, \\"but whether an exemption should be granted in the first instance. And that issue is for Congress to resolve, not this Court.\\"International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 243. =Dissents= \\"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions, whether boxing or football or tennis, and baseball\\", Frankfurter began.International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 248 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). The Toolson majority, which he had been part of, had applied stare decisis, the legal doctrine under which flawed decisions can be upheld as the lesser of two evils. But here he found his colleagues irrational and inconsistent. Minton, too, saw flawed logic. Unlike Frankfurter, he believed that boxing generally did not constitute interstate commerce, noting that the broadcasters and sponsors had not been named as defendants by the government, and that the Court was turning Federal Baseballs conclusion on its head. He conceded that Louis had a monopoly on the championship when he retired and gave the defendants exclusives on the four fighters' championship contests, but from competition in the ring, not the marketplace. \\"As I see it, boxing is not trade or commerce. There can be no monopoly or restraint of nonexistent commerce or trade\\", he concluded.International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 253. Legacy The antitrust suit proceeded and the government won. The IBCNY appealed the divestitures proposed by the judge as having gone past the original offense, and that case came to the Supreme Court again as International Boxing Club of New York v. United States (). Again the justices ruled in the government's favor, and Norris and Wirtz dissolved the organization and sold their interest in the other defendant organizations. While they left boxing, they remained involved in professional sports as owners of the Chicago Blackhawks National Hockey League franchise. Wirtz's grandson Rocky is today the team's principal owner.

He was a partisan of Raymond VI of Toulouse in his wars with the Crown of Aragon and left behind two sirventes attacking Alfonso II of Aragon. Giraut's birthplace cannot be identified with certainty. Historically, there are many locations named Luc or Le Luc in southern France. Giraut may be the G. del Luc who signed two documents of August and October 1197 at Moissac. He definitely had some relationship with the Order of the Temple. Giraut was not an original poet. His Si per malvatz seignoril has the same meter as Talans m'es pres d'En Marques by Guillem de Berguedan. His Ges sitot m'ai ma voluntat fellona is hardly more original, but far more interesting for what it says about Giraut's learning: its melody is borrowed from the chanson de geste Daurel et Beton, as is its \\"hero\\", Boves d'Antona. It is a string of accusations of injustice levelled at Alfonso, including many which indicate that Giraut was well- informed of political events on both sides of the Pyrenees. He mentions Alfonso's mistreatment of his uncle (though we do not know who Giraut's uncle was) and he refers to 1178, when a man claiming to be Alfonso the Battler was executed. He also mentions the capture of the castle of Polp√≠s de Maestrazgo. References *Riquer, Mart√≠n de. Los trovadores: historia literaria y textos. 3 vol. Barcelona: Planeta, 1975.

Plot summary Two young men (the narrator and his friend George) are lamenting their state of poverty and discussing the morning's newspaper. In it, a society columnist named Lionel Pantaloon reports some scandalous gossip about several prominent citizens. The narrator gets a brilliant idea. He reckons the people Pantaloon insults would like to punch him in the nose, but they're unable to because of their standing and position. He proposes he and George start a business performing such acts of vengeance for a price. They come up with a list of services, such as giving someone a black eye, punching his nose, throwing him naked onto Fifth Avenue and putting a rattlesnake (venom extracted) in their car. Then they have a number of cards printed explaining their business and listing their prices. They deliver these to the offended parties, and within two days they have several orders to fulfil. They begin to dream about the riches they'll be paid and living in grand hotels. The narrator has another brainstorm and realizes they can get paid multiple times for the same act. Each customer will think the vengeance was for them alone. Thus, as they have three orders to punch Pantaloon in the nose, they decide to handle him first. The plan is simple: Pantaloon is always at the Penguin Club late at night, so they'll show up and ask for him to come out. George will punch him and then escape in the rented 1934 Chevrolet the narrator has waiting. They telegram the three customers with the details of the encounter so the customers can watch. Then they procure a fake moustache for George to disguise him. At the appointed time, George approaches the doorman and passes him a note to give to Pantaloon. He claims to be a Soviet Consulate worker with a life-and-death matter. Unable to resist the bait, Pantaloon comes out to talk with him. George gives him a tremendous punch on the nose that lifts him clear off his feet. He then dashes to the car and the two men escape. They drive quickly through the snowy streets but soon realize they're being tailed. Knowing they can't escape, they stop. Instead of the police, it turns out to be one of the customers. He explains it was the funniest thing he's ever seen and he happily pays them double their fee. He also advises them to get out of town quickly before Pantaloon figures out what happened. The men wait around another day to receive the rest of their payment and then catch a train out of town. They discuss their plan to bet the money on a horse race, and they daydream about how wealthy and important they'll become. \\"Perhaps we might even get ourselves mentioned in Lionel Pantaloon's column,\\" George muses.

The title is the same as that of the Alii nui of the other islands. The title or phrase M≈ç ªƒ´ is sometimes used for the title of the monarchs of Maui; however, it is not an ancient word in the Hawaiian language and has origins in the mid 19th century. The only monarchs to officially hold the title of M≈ç ªƒ´ are KalƒÅkaua and his sister Liliuokalani.  Overview  The monarchs of Maui, like those of the other Hawaiian islands, claim descent from WƒÅkea and Papa. They were sometimes referred to as M≈çƒ´ beginning in the mid 19th century, and would later become commonly translated from the Hawaiian language into English as the word \\"king\\". Paumakua, the first ruler of Maui, was thirty-first in line of descent from Wakea. In the beginning, from about Paumakua of Maui down to Kawaokaohele's reign, the Alii nui of Maui only controlled the much larger western portion of the island while the chiefs of Hana remained independent. Mauiloa had tried to unite the island once, but troubles with the Hana chief continued. It was under Pi ªilani's reign that he conquered the east and united Maui for the first time. Kahekili II expanded his empire by conquering the neighbouring island of Oahu in 1783 and through marriage of his brother allied himself with the Queen of Kauai. However, his son Kalanik≈´pule was the last of his line. Maui was weakened when Kalanikupule and his uncle, Kaeokulani, fought over the succession to the throne. Maui along with Oahu fell to Kamehameha I in 1795 and ushered in the Kingdom of Hawaii.

The much larger western side was under the rule of the descendants of Paumakua, and East Maui, comprising the districts of Koolau, HƒÅna, Kipahulu, and Kaupo, was at times under independent rulers. The monarchs of HƒÅna, like those of the other Hawaiian chiefdom, probably claimed descent from Wakea and PƒÅpa. These monarchs were in some sense district chiefs and vassals of the Western rulers of Maui. From Eleio to Hoolae the king of HƒÅna remained mostly free from West Maui under Kakaalaneo to Kawaokaohele. The sixth Alii Nui of HƒÅna, Hoolae, became a subject of Pi ªilani and even allowed his daughter to marry him. The Kings of HƒÅna's allegiance to the West Maui M≈çƒ´ were always precarious, even in later times after Piilani's conquest. The main strategic advantage of the Kings of HƒÅna was their command of the fortress of Kauwiki, considered impregnable. =HƒÅna chiefs= *Alii nui Eleio of HƒÅna during the reign of Kakaalaneo *Alii nui Kalahaeha of HƒÅna *Alii nui Lei of HƒÅna *Alii nui Kamohohalii of HƒÅna *Alii nui Kalaehina of HƒÅna *Alii nui Hoolae of HƒÅna See also * History of Maui *Ancient Hawaii *Kingdom of Hawaii *Alii Aimoku of Kauai *Alii Aimoku of Molokai *Alii Aimoku of Hawaii *Alii Aimoku of Oahu *Governors of Maui *Maui County, Hawaii References External links  Hawaiian Roots: Maui Kings Maui Native Hawaiian people Lists of people from Hawaii Hawaiian monarchs Polynesian titles ","title":"Alii nui of Maui"},{"id":"16101531","text":"Leading Edge Group is an Australian-owned buying group with retail shopfronts.

Before he departed for his ill-fated voyage he made a will, which stipulated that heirs of his female relatives must change their surname to Lynch in order to inherit the family estate, a rice plantation. He was taken ill at the end of 1779 and he sailed, with his wife, for St. Eustatius in the West Indies. Their ship disappeared at sea in a storm and was never found. The family estate, Hopsewee, still stands in South Carolina. The Lynch family sold the house in 1752 to Robert Hume whose son, John Hume, lived at Hopsewee in the winter after inheriting it. Upon his death in 1841, his own son, John Hume Lucas, inherited the house. John Hume Lucas died in 1853. Like many Santee plantations, it was abandoned during the Civil War.

He was one of the earliest critics of the spiritual claims of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, having commented on the \\"Golden Bible\\" before it was even published as the Book of Mormon. Cole's publishing philosophy was one of freethought, which flourished in periodicals in the northeastern United States between 1825 and 1850. Life Cole was born in Chesterfield, Massachusetts, the son of Southworth and Rucksbe (Bryant) Cole. In 1797, his family settled on the east side of Canandaigua Lake in Gorham, New York. After a short career as a judge and perhaps a lawyer before that, Cole began editing a weekly newspaper in Palmyra, New York called The Reflector. Under Cole, the newspaper included anything which might spark the interest of a reader from mineralogy to foreign affairs. Cole wrote most of the contents of the paper under the pseudonym \\"Obadiah Dogberry, Esq.\\" In the paper's first edition on September 2, 1829, Cole wrote the first public criticisms of Mormonism: \\"The Golden Bible, by Joseph Smith Junior, author and proprietor, is now in press and will shortly appear. Priestcraft is short lived!\\"\\"Selected Items\\",The [Palmyra] Reflector, September 2, 1829, 1(1). The phrase, \\"author and proprietor\\", appears next to Smith's name on the title page of the first edition of the Book of Mormon. Cole knew this before the book was published because it was being printed in the same one-room print shop as his newspaper. Starting in January 1830, two months before the Book of Mormon was published, the Reflector printed the first few chapters of what he called \\"Jo Smith's Gold Bible\\" accompanied by his own criticisms. Cole obtained the segments of the book by stealing the typeset at E. B. Grandin's press, where the Book of Mormon, as well as the \\"Reflector\\", were being printed. Accounts vary as to what happened afterward. Apparently, Smith confronted Cole and complained that he was violating his copyright. Smith may have threatened to sue and Cole may have challenged Smith to a fight. Shortly thereafter, Cole ceased publishing excerpts from the book. Later, in June 1830, Cole printed two satires of the Book of Mormon under the name, \\"Book of Pukei\\".. This satire involved an old man appearing to Smith dressed as a Native American Indian and claiming to be a messenger sent by Mormon. It also provided some insight into the treasure-digging activities of the Smiths and Luman Walter. Cole's commentary on Mormonism quickly gained a readership outside Palmyra and he went on to print a six-part series with a more analytical tone. \\"Although he did not change his scornful tone,\\" historian Richard L. Bushman wrote, Cole \\"did replace satire with argument and attempted to make a case against Joseph Smith that would appeal to his enlarged readership.\\" Cole ended his tenure as editor of the Reflector in 1831. Cole presented Smith as a charlatan too uneducated to have written the Book of Mormon himself and supposed that Smith got help from \\"Walters the Magician\\" (Luman Walter), who was said to have shown his followers a Latin translation of Cicero and claimed that it was a record of the Native Americans. Cole mentions this idea in the \\"Book of Pukei\\". He ridiculed Smith's healing of Newel Knight, objecting that \\"no prophet, since the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, has performed half so many wonders as have been attributed to that spindle shanked ignoramus Jo Smith\\". In 1832, Cole moved to nearby Rochester, New York, where he published the Liberal Advocate until 1834. In this paper, he famously criticized the revivals of evangelist Charles Grandison Finney, a leader of the Second Great Awakening. Cole died in 1835. See also *Eber D.

Simon became one of the most important bowmakers of his time. He worked in Paris for Peccatte, Vuillaume and Gand Fr√®res. In 1847 he purchased Dominique Peccatte's business partnering with Joseph Henry until 1851. His bows have two distinct head models, one of his own and the other based on a Peccatte model. Not much is known about his early work. He probably apprenticed from the age of twelve in Mirecourt, working for someone like Pajeot (speculation based on the elegance of his work by P. Child). He arrived in Paris in 1838. According to experts, Simon started making bows at least as early as 1827. The earliest bow attributed to him, however, according to Raffin & Millant, was made for Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, and dates only to 1845 when he was thirty-seven years old. Simon entered partnership with Joseph Henry from 1848-1851. Simon was one of the most skilled bowmakers ever. He made bows on several patterns and of varying weights. Sometimes he used a model similar to the Peccatte interpretation of Fran√ßois Tourte, and these heavier Simon bows play similarly to Peccatte bows. On the other hand, the classic, bell-shaped Simon head is derived from an earlier Tourte model. These tend to be lighter and more flexible than the classic Peccatte model. The finest Simon bows have a highly attractive, lithe flexibility and a genuine beauty of tone. Some of his bows bear the stamp: \\"Simon a Paris.\\" His best bows are strong, finely balanced sticks which produce a smooth and velvety tone. Simon is one of the few makers from 1850‚Äì1875 to have made octagonal bows either for himself or for Vuillaume. Pierre made few or no viola bows. The chamfer of a Simon bow follows a large, generous curve which can be seen from the profile. Also, the chamfers are quite symmetrical in a Simon bow. Pierre made bows for Vuillaume, Gand Fr√®res, Gand & Bernardel Fr√®res, George Chanot and Bernardel et Fils. Pierre's brother, Barth√©l√©my, younger by two years, was also a bow maker.

Born in Wadsworth, Illinois, he is best known for his directorial work on the films Spaced Invaders, Angus, Baby's Day Out, The Genesis Code and 5-25-77. He also has written and produced such films as Dragonheart. Career Starting out in the field of practical special effects and models, Johnson was one of the first people outside of Industrial Light and Magic to see Star Wars (albeit in an incomplete form) as chronicled in his semi-autobiographical film 5-25-77. He first saw the film during Spring Break, sometime between late March and early April 1977, when ILM was scrambling to complete VFX shots. He had also visited the set of Close Encounters of the Third Kind at Future General Corporation a few days before and found Douglas Trumbull's work to be \\"engineered, intimidating and mature\\" compared to John Dykstra's \\"shooting-from-the-hip\\" style. Johnson ascended into mainstream Hollywood filmmaking following the modest success of Spaced Invaders, invited by John Hughes to work on his adaptation of Dennis the Menace, and then later, the comedy Baby's Day Out. Baby's Day Out was tremendously popular in South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In India, it was played at the largest theater in Calcutta for over a year. He also wrote the fantasy film Dragonheart, which spawned a franchise. He proposed the idea for the film to producer Raffaella De Laurentiis. Johnson described it as \\"The Skin Game with a dragon in it...or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Dragon\\", and that he wanted \\"the idea of a dragon and a knight conning villages for money\\" because he thought that the concept was \\"not only funny, but kind of sweet\\". Johnson currently serves as a filmmaking instructor at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.https://www.uncsa.edu/faculty-staff/patrick- johnson.aspx =5-25-77= Johnson began developing 5-25-77 in 1999 after he met Gary Kurtz. In 2001, Johnson began seeking funding for 5-25-77, and didn't start shooting the film until 2004. An incomplete \\"preview cut\\" was exhibited in 2007 at Star Wars Celebration IV and at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2008, where 5-25-77 won the Heineken Red Star Award.IMDb On May 25, 2012, the 35th anniversary of the release of Star Wars, Johnson began a cross-country road trip in his 1975 Ford Pinto to attract the funding needed to finish the film's remaining post-production work. Johnson spent the summer of 2012 test-screening 5-25-77, his trip also becoming the subject of a documentary called Hearts of Dorkness, by filmmaker Morgan Flores.Dorkshelf.com In 2013, Toronto International Film Festival's Next Wave Film Festival invited Johnson to show 5-25-77 as a \\"work in progress\\", the attention from the festival Johnson attributed to the bid of his promotional tour the summer before. In 2017, it was announced Johnson had completed the film and that it would receive a limited theatrical release on May 25.https://www.cnet.com/news/5-25-77-star-wars-movie-first-fan-patrick-read- johnson-interview/ References External links  1952 births Living people American directors American film directors American male screenwriters English-language film directors Film directors from Illinois Male screenwriters People from Wadsworth, Illinois Screenwriters from Illinois Writers from Chicago ","title":"Patrick Read Johnson"},{"id":"16102053","text":"Clark Peak may refer to: * Clark Peak (Alaska) in Alaska, USA * Clark Peak (Antarctica) * Clark Peak (Arizona) in Arizona, USA * Clark Peak (British Columbia) in British Columbia, Canada * Clark Peak (California) in California, USA * Clark Peak (Medicine Bow Mountains) in the Medicine Bow Mountains, Colorado, USA * Clark Peak (Elk Range) in the Elk Range, Colorado, USA * Clark Peak (New Mexico) in New Mexico, USA * Clark Peak (Washington) in Washington, USA * Clark Peak near Nelson, New Zealand ","title":"Clark Peak"},{"id":"16102071","text":"The Reverend Frederick Valentine Melsheimer (September 25, 1749, Negenborn, Brunswick ‚Äì June 30, 1814, Hanover, Pennsylvania) was a Lutheran clergyman and early American entomologist, called the \\"Father of American Entomology\\" by successor Thomas Say. He was the author of the first major entomological work in the United States: A Catalogue of Insects of Pennsylvania (1806), a sixty- page work that describes 1,363 species of beetles. Biography Melsheimer studied at the university in Helmstedt from 1772 to 1776 before becoming chaplain to the Duke of Brunswick's Dragoons Regiment. With this regiment he arrived in Canada in 1776 to fight alongside British troops in the American Revolutionary War. He was taken prisoner by the American army on August 16, 1777 following their victory at the Battle of Bennington and remained in prison for fourteen months. After being released on parole, he resigned from his office of chaplain and began to preach in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In May 1779, he accepted a call as pastor of five Lutheran congregations in Dauphin County. He married Maria Agnes Man on June 3, 1779. In 1784, he moved to Manheim, where he was ordained to the ministry by the Lutheran ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1785, and was pastor at New Holland from 1786 until 1789. He was pastor at Hanover from 1790 until 1814. His service exerted a strong influence on the German colonists of Pennsylvania, and his entomological interests were said to \\"furnish some of his parishioners with mild amusement\\". His insect collection, inherited and increased by his second son Frederick Ernst Melsheimer and his son's friend Daniel Ziegler, was eventually purchased by Harvard University and formed the basis for what is now the largest university-owned collection of insects in the United States. His Catalogue was intended to be a three volume work, but illness prevented publication of more than the first volume, in 1806. Melsheimer was also interested in mineralogy and astronomy, and served as Professor of Languages at the recently founded Franklin College in 1787. He died in 1814 of lung disease. Two of his eleven children also devoted themselves to natural history: John Frederick Melsheimer (1780-1829) and Frederick Ernst Melsheimer (1782-1873).

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, cited as one Lankford's most important works. Description and history The Allen University campus is located northeast of downtown Columbia, centered in a block bounded by Taylor, Harden, Pine, and Hampton Streets. The Chappelle Building is set at the northwestern corner of this block, facing Harden Street. It is a 3-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with stone trim, and has a slate roof with a reproduction of its original cupola (destroyed by lightning in 1974) on top, and five gabled dormers. The main facade is fourteen bays wide, with a three-arched single- story porch extending across the middle six bays. The porch is topped by a low balustrade, and there is a pedimented entrance to the upper level of the porch on the second floor. Windows on the lower two levels have stone keystones, and there are panels of garlands between the second and third levels. photo c. 2010 Allen University was founded in 1870, and established its campus in Columbia in 1880. This Colonial Revival building, which still plays a prominent role in the campus, was built 1922-25 to a design by John Anderson Lankford (1874-1946) for the then-substantial sum of $165,000. Lankford rose from humble beginnings to earn degrees in mechanical engineering at the Tuskegee Institute. While his training included drafting, it did not include architectural design. At various university positions (mainly with predominantly African-American schools), he was called on to design buildings, eventually leading to his appointment as the Chief Architect of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in 1908. The Chappelle Administration Building is one of his major works. The building is named in honour of Bishop William D. Chappelle who was the university's president from 1898‚Äì1899.

He previously served in the Kansas House of Representatives from 2003 through 2004. Biography Born in Wichita, Kansas, on February 8, 1978, Donald Betts Jr. attended elementary school in the Wichita area, where he spent much of his childhood. His political career began in the 2nd grade, when classmates elected him as the class representative at Hyde Elementary School. At the age of ten, however, he moved with his mother and younger brother to North Las Vegas to unite with his grandfather the late Reverend I.W. Wilson of the True Love Missionary Baptist Church. Betts, his mother, and brother eventually moved to an inner city community quite unlike Las Vegas‚Äôs famous strip. Betts grew up outside all the glitz and glamor, where he witnessed violent criminal activity.‚Äù Betts avoided the negative elements abounding in his community by focusing his attention on concerns closer to home. He still recalls his upstairs neighbor, Eliza Perkins, an elderly woman whom he often visited as a child, helping her around the house or just providing company. Betts grew up in a single-parent household headed by his mother, Charmaine Betts. She struggled to provide for her two children and keep them on the ‚Äústraight and narrow.‚Äù She remained a full-time parent for nearly ten years. When the boys were older, she worked at Macy‚Äôs, in a telemarketing firm, and even as a movie extra in such films as Vegas Vacation and Casino. At the age of thirteen, Betts began the start of a career in public service by working with the Doolittle Tutorial Program, helping elementary school students with their homework. He later attended Clark High School, where constant gang activity forced him to focus not only on his education, but also on his security. The threat of violence went so far as to create the need for metal detectors and security cameras. Violence was not limited to the school building, however, but also occurred on the school bus. Betts eventually rode the city bus to school. Despite these problems, he remained very active at his high school, where he served on the drum squad and played the string bass in the orchestra. Betts later transferred to the Advanced Technologies Academy (ATA), where a new and innovative approach to secondary education was developed. The goal at ATA was to train students for the right profession, offering seven program areas in fields such as law, banking, commerce, and technology. With the goal of becoming an attorney like his uncle Wendell, Betts graduated from the program with an emphasis in law. He stayed active while at ATA: he was elected president of the Law Club, was involved in the Kappa Leadership League, and participated in the Trial by Peers Program. He was also a recipient of the Principal‚Äôs Award. After graduation, on a visit to his extended family in Wichita, Betts felt at home and decided to move back to Wichita to attend Friends University. While an undergraduate, he was involved in football, the NAACP, a vocal group (the ‚ÄúSinging Quakers‚Äù), and several bands, in which he played the string bass. He also became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi. His start in elective office also began at Friends, when Betts was elected president of the Multicultural Student Association and became the first African-American student body president. After graduation from Friends in 2002 with a degree in political science and history, Betts applied to law school but was not accepted. For the first time in his life, he felt that he had failed to overcome an obstacle and could find no other direction for his life. He worked as a counselor for a level six juvenile treatment facility and eventually persuaded the Wichita Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi to restart the Kappa Leadership League program to provide leadership training to high school boys in Wichita. He also decided to become politically active in the Democratic Party and was soon running for the Kansas State House of Representatives in the 84th District, the part of Wichita where he lived with his grandmother. He ran a small, grass roots campaign motivated by his strong personal desire to better serve and address the needs of his community. He walked door-to-door and talked with voters, put up yard signs, and learned to handle himself with the media. His efforts were rewarded in November 2002 when, at the age of 24, he was elected. For most of the 2003 session, which ran from January through April and into May, Betts concentrated on learning the ways of the Kansas House, sharing an office with other representatives from the Wichita area and discussing bills and resolutions with his colleagues. Towards the middle of the session, he proposed an amendment to address the recurring problem of an increasing prison population by making rehabilitation an option to prison or jail time for first-time drug offenders. After he successfully shepherded it through the House, his colleagues discouraged his plan to propose the bill in the Senate, but Betts paid them no heed. He got to know the senators and lobbied hard to get support. As the session ended, he was gratified to see his amendment added to the bill, which was later signed into law by Governor Kathleen Sebelius. As 2003 came to an end, however, Betts was presented with a new opportunity. U.L. ‚ÄúRip‚Äù Gooch, the state senator for the district that included all of Betts‚Äô House district, decided to retire. At 80, Gooch was the oldest senator serving. At first reluctant to throw his hat in the ring, Betts was eventually persuaded to give it a shot. He approached each committee member personally and eventually put together the necessary support to win, capturing the victory by one vote. On January 13, 2004, he was sworn in‚Äîas the youngest senator serving in the history of Kansas. In his second session, he shepherded a bill to ban racial profiling through the Senate and House. After his re-election in 2004, he was no longer the lowest in seniority, but he still may be the youngest in age. He was among the senators who voted for the compromise education bill during the 2005 Special Session. In 2006, he advocated for some changes to the racial profiling bill to make it tighter and easier to enforce, plus worked on a resolution recommending that Kansas‚Äô public schools institute strict dress codes or mandate school uniforms. He also was active in pressing for the passage of Scruffy‚Äôs Law, which increased the punishment for intentional aggravated animal cruelty from a misdemeanor to a felony. In 2007, Betts introduced and saw passed a bill to bring about divestment of the KPERS retirement funds from companies doing business in and with Sudan until such time as the Darfur genocide ends. Betts was accepted to join the Leadership Kansas class of 2007. In addition to the many boards and organizations he belonged to, he is a strong believer in continuing education, so he pursued his master's degree at Friends University. In 2008 Senator Betts launched a bid for the Kansas Fourth District Congressional seat for United States Congress in an uphill battle against 14-year incumbent Todd Tiahrt. In 2008, Betts fulfilled the remainder of his term as a Kansas state senator and in 2009 moved to Australia to be with his wife Tania (a successful business woman and entrepreneur), after an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the United States Congress. In 2015, Betts enrolled to study law at Monash University law chambers. In 2020, Betts became the first African American in Australia to complete a Juris Doctorate degree from Monash University. Betts is the founder of the North American Australian Lawyers Alliance. In addition to his duties at Global Law Firm Norton Rose Fulbright Australia, he is also responsible for marketing and development at Australia's first Indigenous majority owned law firm, Jaramer Legal, under the directorship of Peter Cash (head of office at Norton Rose Fulbright Australia) and Bevan Mailman (managing partner at Jaramer Legal). Betts is an inaugural graduate of the 2019 class of the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia Global Leadership Academy. Betts is a frequent guest on Australia television and radio programs as a commentator on U.S. politics and current events. He and his co-host Diana Elliott operate a podcast called Greenland the Podcast, where they explore the differences and similarities between the United States and Australia.

Hassalo became famous for running the Cascades of the Columbia on May 26, 1888 at a speed approaching an hour. This vessel should not be confused with other steamboats with the same or a similar name, including Hassalo (1899) and Hassaloe (1857).Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, at 15, 67, 102, and 137, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 Construction Hassalo was built at The Dalles, Oregon in 1880. She was the first steamboat built for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. which had recently bought out the powerful monopoly Oregon Steam Navigation Co. Hassalo was long, , depth of hold, and rated at 462 tons. Hassalo was built entirely of wood, driven by a sternwheel which in turn drew its power from twin single- cylinder steam engines, each of 17\\" bore and 60\\" stroke.Wright, E.W., ed., Lewis & Dryden Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 273 (page 297 online), Lewis & Dryden Printing Co., Portland, OR 1895 (document is in DjVu format) Operations on the Middle Columbia Hassalo ran on the \\"Middle\\" Columbia river, that is, the reach between the Cascades and the Dalles, Oregon. The Columbia river was only freely navigable up to the Cascades of the Columbia, a stretch of rapids in the Columbia Gorge that has since been submerged by water pooling behind Bonneville Dam. Above the Cascades there was a stretch of navigable river going east about to The Dalles. This reach was called the \\"Middle River.\\" After that, navigation was further impeded by a longer series of rapids, the most important of which was Celilo Falls. Before rail lines were built, travellers bound from Portland, Oregon for Idaho or the Inland Empire generally went by way of the Columbia River. This route was like a series of giant stairsteps. First, traffic proceeded by steamboat up to the Cascades, where rapids blocked the river to all upstream traffic and made downstream traffic extremely hazardous. This then required transfer to a portage railroad (first hauled by mules, later by steam engines), which proceeded to the top of the Cascades. Travellers then boarded another steamboat to proceed up river to the Dalles, where the process would be repeated for a portage around Celilo Falls and the other rapids upriver from the Dalles, which like the Cascades were unnavigable both upstream and downstream. This, the middle river, was the route Hassalo ran on from 1880 to 1888. Hassalo‚Äôs first captain on the middle river was Fred Wilson, followed by H.F. Coe, then Captain John McNulty for the last five years on the Columbia. Running the Cascades Capt. James W. Troup As railways began to be completed along the banks of the Columbia, the steamboats, tied to the river which required too much loading and unloading of passengers and cargo, proved to be unable to compete, and one by one they were taken off the Middle River. The turn of the Hassalo came on Saturday, May 26, 1888, under the command of Captain James W. Troup. The event had been announced well in advance, and three thousand people gathered along the banks of the Columbia to watch. The channel through the Cascades was six miles (10 km) long. The Northwest Masters and Pilots Association organized two steamers, the R.R. Thompson and the Lurline to bring crowds up from Portland and Vancouver to witness the event.\\"Shot the Rapids ‚Äì The Steamer Hassalo Accomplishes its Perilous Passage Safely ‚Äì Three Thousand People Witness the Thrilling Sight ‚Äì Successful Excursion ‚Äì Six Mile Run Made in Seven Minutes\\", Sunday Oregonian, May 27, 1888 Describing the excursion up river, the Sunday Oregonian wrote: The excursion boats arrived at the Cascades, and the excursionists disembarked on the north, Washington Territory side. There was a scramble up the bank to board the portage train which was to take the crowd to the Upper Cascades where the run was to start. There weren‚Äôt enough seats on the train, so a part of the crowd had to wait for the train to run up to the Upper Cascades and return. People had also come down from The Dalles on the Harvest Queen, which ran down to the Cascades with the Hassalo. Other people came up on a train from Bonneville so that there were about 3,000 excursionists overall. As the crowds assembled, both Hassalo and Harvest Queen were at the Upper Cascades wharf with all flags flying. When everything was finally ready, the scene was described by the Sunday Oregonian‚Äôs correspondent: Hassalo with just 15 people on board, passed by the people on the bank in just 30 seconds and disappeared from sight around a bend in the river. As she ran down the rest of the six mile (10 km) run, she exchanged whistle blasts with locomotives on the railway tracks besides the river. Once at the end of the rapids, which she ran in seven minutes, Captain Troup took Hassalo down the Columbia and up the Willamette River to Portland. Remarkable as this was, even the run of Hassalo was not the fastest through the Cascades. On June 3, 1881, captain Troup had taken R.R. Thompson (sternwheeler), one of the same boats that was to run on the Hassalo excursion seven years later, through the Cascades, completing the run twenty seconds faster, and this speed was bested exactly one year later by the R.R. Thompson, itself, when, then, under the mastery of the earlier mentioned and unrivaled riverboatman, Captain John McNulty (steamboat captain). For those times there were not 3,000 people to watch, nor was a famous photograph taken, so the R.R. Thompson runs are largely forgotten by history. Puget Sound service After minor repairs in Portland, Hassalo was transferred to Puget Sound, where under Capt. O. A. Anderson she was placed on the Bellingham route. She also served on the Olympia-Tacoma-Seattle route. In 1890, Hassalo collided with the smaller sternwheeler Otter, damaging Otter beyond repair. Return to Columbia River In 1892 Hassalo was returned to the Columbia River where she was converted to a towboat, serving there until 1898, when she was dismantled.

The Lithuanians won a decisive victory and finalized their conquest of the Principality of Kiev. Background After the death of its ruler Berdi Beg Khan in 1359 the Golden Horde experienced a series of succession disputes and wars that lasted two decades (1359‚Äì81). The Horde began fracturing into separate districts (ulus). Taking advantage of internal disorder within the Horde, Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania organized a campaign into Tatar lands. He aimed to secure and expand southern territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, particularly the Principality of Kiev. Kiev had already come under semi-Lithuanian control after the Battle on the Irpin River in early 1320s, but still paid tribute to the Horde. Battle In 1362 or 1363, Algirdas marched between lower Dnieper and Southern Bug. First, Algirdas captured remaining territories of the Principality of Chernigov ‚Äì the bulk of the territory, including the capital in Bryansk, fell under Lithuanian control around 1357‚Äì1358. The Lithuanians then attacked Korshev (–ö–æ—Ä—à–æ–≤), an unidentified fortress located in the upper reaches of the Bystraya Sosna River, tributary of the Don River. It is believed that Algirdas further conquered territories of the former Principality of Pereslavl. The area belonged to Crimean ulus which was engaged in a campaign against New Sarai and could not organize effective resistance. In autumn, the Lithuanian army moved west and crossed the Dnieper River towards Podolia. Three Tatar beys of Podolia gathered an army to resist the invasion. It is believed that the armies met at present-day Torhovytsia (). At the time the town was known as Yabgu in Turkic, or viceroy, regent town, and Sinie Vody in Russian, or Blue Waters. A short description of the battle survives only from late and not very reliable work of Maciej Stryjkowski, published in 1582. According to Stryjkowski, Algirdas organized his army into six groups and arranged them in a half circle. The Tatars started the battle by hurling arrows into the sides of the Lithuanian formation. Such attacks had little effect and the Lithuanians and Ruthenians, armed with spears and swords, moved forward and broke the front lines of the Tatar army. Sons of Karijotas with units from Navahrudak attacked Tatar flanks with crossbows. The Tatars could not maintain their formation and broke into a disorganized retreat. Algirdas achieved a decisive victory. Aftermath The victory brought the city of Kiev and a large part of present-day Ukraine, including sparsely populated Podolia and Dykra, under the control of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The duchy also gained access to the Black Sea. Algirdas left his son Vladimir in Kiev. After taking Kiev, Lithuania became a direct neighbor and rival of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Podolia was trusted to Aleksander, Yuri, Konstantin, and Fedir ‚Äì sons of Karijotas, nephews of Algirdas, and commanders during the battle. Historiography 2012 stamp of Ukraine dedicated to the Battle of Blue Waters The battle has received comparatively little attention from historians. Some of it is attributed to lack of historical sources. It received a handful of fragmentary mentions in Ruthenian and Russian chronicles. The most important source of information is the Tale about Podolia, which was incorporated into the Lithuanian Chronicles. The Tale was produced by the Lithuanians sometime around the Lithuanian Civil War (1432‚Äì38) when Lithuania fought against Poland for control of Podolia. As such, the Tale is a piece of political propaganda written to support Lithuanian claims to Podolia and exalt virtues of Karijotas's sons rather than to give an accurate account of military campaign. Slavic historians tended to minimize importance of the battle. Lithuanian historian Tomas Baranauskas claims that Russian historians chose to emphasize their victory against the Tatars in the 1380 Battle of Kulikovo while Polish historians did not want to emphasize Lithuanian claims to Podolia. For example, Jan D≈Çugosz did not mention the battle at all. However, in recent years interest in the battle has increased. Polish historian Stefan Maria Kuczy≈Ñski produced a dedicated study Sine Wody in 1935, Lithuanian Romas Bat≈´ra published Lietuva taut≈≥ kovoje prie≈° Aukso ordƒÖ. Nuo Batu antpl≈´d≈æio iki m≈´≈°io prie Mƒólyn≈≥j≈≥ Vanden≈≥ in 1975, and Ukrainian Felix Shabuldo published numerous articles. Ukrainian historians held two conferences in Kirovohrad in 1997 and 1998. The resulting collection of articles was published by the Institute of History of Ukraine in 2005 (). In 2012, another conference, dedicated to the 650th anniversary of the battle, was held by the Vytautas Magnus University.

This happens when they seek external technologies for their business or external markets for their own technologies. It has implications for the value of technology and innovations as well as their development by more than one firm and for the need for and limitations of patent protection. Arrow's information paradox theory was set out in a 1962 paper.Arrow, Kenneth J. Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention, in The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity, 609 (Nat‚Äôl Bureau of Econ. Research ed. 1962). Cornell Law School professor Oskar Liivak has written in a paper for a conference at Stanford University that Arrow's \\"paper has been one of the foundational theoretical pillars of the incentive based theory of patents as Arrow‚Äôs work is thought to rule out a strictly market-based solution.\\"Liivak, Oskar. The (Relatively) Easy Case for Patents on Inventions. (2012). Retrieved August 7, 2014. A fundamental tenet of the paradox is that the customer, i.e. the potential purchaser of the information describing a technology (or other information having some value, such as facts), wants to know the technology and what it does in sufficient detail as to understand its capabilities or have information about the facts or products to decide whether or not to buy it.Lepp√§l√§, Samuli, Cardiff University, Arrow's Paradox and Unprotected Markets for Information.

Once the customer has this detailed knowledge, however, the seller has in effect transferred the technology to the customer without any compensation. This has been argued to show the need for patent protection. If the buyer trusts the seller, or is protected via contract, then they only need to know the results that the technology will provide, along with any caveats for its usage in a given context.Burstein, Michael J.

Early life Dooley was born at Tumbarumba, New South Wales and educated at Wagga Wagga Superior Public School and at Courabyra, but left school early to become a shearer and miner. From 1901 to 1904 he was as an organizer of the Rural Workers' Union.

In 2011 IMDR got AICTE approval, and currently IMDR is offering PGDM course approved by AICTE and DTE. History The Institute of Management Development and Research (IMDR) was founded by Dr R. T. Doshi and Shri Sumatilal Shah in 1974, as a constituent unit of the Deccan Education Society. They were closely associated with Wrangler G. S. Mahajani, who had served as the Principal of Fergusson College in Pune and later, as the Vice Chancellor of Pune University. In 1973, Wrangler Mahajani in his capacity as the Vice Chancellor, suggested to the D. E. Society that a new institution be formed to impart management education under its aegis. Dr Doshi and Shri Shah not only made large donations but also mobilized funds from their friends and associates. It is with these funds that the main building of IMDR was constructed on the historic Fergusson campus. Wr. Mahajani made the suggestion to set up an institute outside the university, from a point of view that the professional and inter-disciplinary nature of management education required a different ambience. From 1974 to 1977, IMDR conducted the courses under affiliation to the university. It took over the MBA programme of the MBA Centre of the University of Pune and the DBM programme, run in the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC, a sister institution) since 1968. Affiliated to the University of Pune, the IMDR was also a recognised centre for research leading to a Ph.D. In 1977, the IMDR became an autonomous institution by voluntarily delinking from the University of Pune. Since then it has carried on its activities independent of the university or other statutory bodies. Campus The Instructional area available on the IMDR campus includes classrooms, tutorial room, library, computer centre and an auditorium with the seating capacity of 175. The main campus has an administrative block, students' common room, canteen and other amenities, including the reprographic facility which is made available for students on the campus. The total built up area is over 24,000 sq feet. There are ten residential units for the non-teaching staff and three for the teaching staff. Associated institutes The Main Building of Fergusson College The college shares its campus with Fergusson College and Jaganath Rathi Vocational Guidance and Training Institute (JRGVTI), both governed by the Deccan Education Society. Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), established in 1943, is closely associated with Fergusson College. At the northern end of the campus, next to the New Academic Building, lies DES Law College. Gokhale Institute The Deccan Gymkhana area of western Pune is well known for its educational institutes. Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Marathwada College of Commerce and Symbiosis International University are other well-known colleges situated around the Hanuman Tekdi hillock that overlooks Fergusson. Also located nearby are the ILS Law College, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and the Agarkar Research Institute. Affiliation The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) have approved IMDR's PGDM programme with an intake of 120 students. The institute is a member of the Association of Management Development Institutions in South Asia (AMDISA), the Confederation of Indian Industry International Chamber of Commerce (CII), the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce, and the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA). Eligibility All candidates to the PGDM of IMDR are required to take the CAT (Common Admission Test) of the Indian Institutes of Management (IIM). Recently IMDR got AICTE approval and because of AICTE & DTE approval, other entrance tests may or may not be accepted.

The lower the aniline point, the greater is the content of aromatic compounds in the oil. The aniline point serves as a reasonable proxy for aromaticity of oils consisting mostly of saturated hydrocarbons (i.e. alkanes, paraffins) or unsaturated compounds (mostly aromatics). Significant chemical functionalization of the oil (chlorination, sulfonation, etc.) can interfere with the measurement, due to changes to the solvency of the functionalized oil. Determination of aniline point Equal volumes of aniline and oil are stirred continuously in a test tube and heated until the two merge into a homogeneous solution. Heating is stopped and the tube is allowed to cool. The temperature at which the two phases separate out is recorded as aniline point. References * Gupta, O.P. Fuels, Furnaces, Refractories.

Cyropolis (Latin form of Gr. Kyro√∫polis () and ŒöœçœÅŒøœÖ œÄœåŒªŒµŒπAelian, Characteristics of Animals, ¬ß 16.3 literally \\"The City of Cyrus\\") was an ancient city founded by Cyrus the Great in 544 BCE to mark the northeastern border of his Achaemenid empire. Location It is identified as probably with the medieval and modern city of Khujand in northern Tajikistan, but it may also be Jizak on the Jaxartes river. Alexander the Great may have established his own guard-town of Alexandria Eschate on the same location, simply renaming the Achaemenid city of Cyropolis. Cyropolis may also correspond to the modern day city of Istaravshan. History Cyropolis was the largest of seven towns in the region that Alexander the Great targeted for conquest in 329 B.C. His goal was the conquest of Sogdiana. Alexander first sent Craterus to Cyropolis, the largest of the towns holding Sogdiana against Alexander's forces. Craterus' instructions were to \\"take up a position close to the town, surround it with a ditch and stockade, and then assemble such siege engines as might suit his purpose....\\" The idea was to keep the inhabitants focused on their own defenses and to prevent them from sending assistance out to the other towns. Starting from Gazza, Alexander went on to conquer the other surrounding towns. Five of the seven towns were taken in two days. Many of the inhabitants were killed. Alexander then arrived at Cyropolis, which was the best fortified of the towns and had the largest population. It also had reputedly the best fighters of the region. Alexander battered Cyropolis' defenses with the siege engines. While the bombardment went on, Alexander ordered certain of his troops to sneak through a dried-up water course that went under the town's wall. Alexander also joined on this mission and once inside his troops opened the town's gate to admit his attacking force. Once the natives saw that the town was taken, they fell violently upon the attackers. Alexander received a violent blow from a stone that landed upon his head and neck. Craterus was wounded by an arrow. But the defenders were driven off. Arrian puts the defender's force at about 15,000 fighting men and claims that 8,000 of them were killed in the first phase of the operation. The rest apparently sought refuge inside the town's central fortress, but surrendered after one day for lack of water. Accounts of how the battle went down differ among authors. Arrian cites Ptolemy as saying Cyropolis surrendered from the start, and Arrian also states that according to Aristobulus the place was stormed and everyone was massacred.

Overview  Elementary steps like proton coupled electron transfer and the movement of electrons between an electrode and substrate are special to electrochemical processes. Electrochemical mechanisms are important to all redox chemistry including corrosion, redox active photochemistry including photosynthesis, other biological systems often involving electron transport chains and other forms of homogeneous and heterogeneous electron transfer. Such reactions are most often studied with standard three electrode techniques such as cyclic voltammetry(CV), chronoamperometry, and bulk electrolysis as well as more complex experiments involving rotating disk electrodes and rotating ring-disk electrodes. In the case of photoinduced electron transfer the use of time- resolved spectroscopy is common.  Formalism  When describing electrochemical reactions an \\"E\\" and \\"C\\" formalism is often employed. The E represents an electron transfer; sometimes EO and ER are used to represent oxidations and reductions respectively. The C represents a chemical reaction which can be any elementary reaction step and is often called a \\"following\\" reaction. In coordination chemistry common C steps which \\"follow\\" electron transfer are ligand loss and association. The ligand loss or gain is associated with a geometric change in the complexes coordination sphere. :[MLn]2+ \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí [MLn]+ E :[MLn]+ ‚Üí [ML(n-1)]+ \\\\+ L C The reaction above would be called an EC reaction.  Characterization  The production of [ML(n-1)]+ in the reaction above by the \\"following\\" chemical reaction produces a species directly at the electrode that could display redox chemistry anywhere in a CV plot or none at all. The change in coordination from [MLn]+ to [ML(n-1)]+ often prevents the observation of \\"reversible\\" behavior during electrochemical experiments like cyclic voltammetry. On the forward scan the expected diffusion wave is observed, in example above the reduction of [MLn]2+ to [MLn]1+. However, on the return scan the corresponding wave is not observed, in the example above this would be the wave corresponding to the oxidation of [MLn]1+ to [MLn]2+. In our example there is no [MLn]1+ to oxidize since it has been converted to [ML(n-1)]+ through ligand loss. The return wave can sometimes be observed by increasing the scan rates so the following chemical reaction can be observed before the chemical reaction takes place. This often requires the use of ultramicroelectrodes (UME) capable of very high scan rates of 0.5 to 5.0 V/s. Plots of forward and reverse peak ratios against modified forms of the scan rate often identify the rate of the chemical reaction. It has become a common practice to model such plots with electrochemical simulations. The results of such studies are of disputed practical relevance since simulation requires excellent experimental data, better than that routinely obtained and reported. Furthermore, the parameters of such studies are rarely reported and often include an unreasonably high variable to data ratio (ref?). A better practice is to look for a simple, well documented relationship between observed results and implied phenomena; or to investigate a specific physical phenomenon using an alternative technique such as chronoamperometry or those involving a rotating electrode.  Electrocatalysis  Electrocatalysis is a catalytic process involving oxidation or reduction through the direct transfer of electrons. The electrochemical mechanisms of electrocatalytic processes are a common research subject for various fields of chemistry and associated sciences. This is important to the development of water oxidation and fuel cells catalysts. For example, half the water oxidation reaction is the reduction of protons to hydrogen, the subsequent half reaction. :2H+ \\\\+ 2e‚àí ‚Üí H2 This reaction requires some form of catalyst to avoid a large overpotential in the delivery of electrons. A catalyst can accomplish this reaction through different reaction pathways, two examples are listed below for the homogeneous catalysts [MLn]2+. :Pathway 1 :[MLn]2+ \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí [MLn]+ E :[MLn]+ \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí [HMLn]2+ C :[HMLn]2+ \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí [HMLn]+ E :[HMLn]+ \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí [H2MLn]2+ C :[H2MLn]2+ ‚Üí [MLn]2+ \\\\+ H2 C :Pathway 2 :[MLn]2+ \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí [MLn]+ E :[MLn]+ \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí [HMLn]2+ C :2[HMLn]2+ ‚Üí [MLn]2+ \\\\+ H2 C Pathway 1 is described as an ECECC while pathway 2 would be described as an ECC. If the catalyst was being considered for solid support pathway 1 which requires a single metal center to function would be a viable candidate. In contrast a solid support system which separates the individual metal centers would render a catalysts that operates through pathway 2 useless since it requires a step which is second order in metal center. Determining the reaction mechanism is much like other methods with some techniques unique to electrochemistry. In most cases electron transfer can be assumed to be much faster than the chemical reactions. Unlike stoichiometric reactions where the steps between the starting materials and the rate limiting step dominate in catalysis the observed reaction order is usually dominated by the steps between the catalytic resting state and the rate limiting step.  \\"Following\\" physical transformations  During potential variant experiments common to go through a redox couple in which the major species is transformed from a species that is soluble in the solution to one that is insoluble. This results in nucleation process in which a new species plates out on the working electrode. If a species has been deposited on the electrode during a potential sweep then on the return sweep a stripping wave is usually observed. :[MLn]+(solvated) \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí [MLn]0(solid) nucleation :[MLn]0(solid) ‚Üí e‚àí \\\\+ [MLn]+(solvated) stripping While the nucleation wave may be pronounced or difficult the detect the stripping wave is usually very distinct. Often these phenomena can be avoided by reducing the concentration of the complex in solution. Neither these physical state changes involve a chemical reaction mechanism but they are worth mentioning here since the resulting data is at times confused with some chemical reaction mechanisms.

Album slovenskih knji≈æevnikov. Ljubljana: Mladinska Knjiga, p. 160. was a Slovene poet. His works were banned from schools and libraries during the Titoist regime in Slovenia, but since the late 1980s he has been re-evaluated as one of the foremost Slovene poets of the 20th century.  Life  Balantiƒç was born in a working-class family in Kamnik,Cox, John K. 2004. Slovenia: Evolving Loyalties. London: Routledge.Plut-Pregelj, Leopoldina, & Carole Rogel. 2010. The A to Z of Slovenia. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 33. in the Slovenian region of Upper Carniola in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Before World War II, he studied Slavic linguistics at the University of Ljubljana. As a student, Balantiƒç professed left-wing leanings, with a sympathy towards Christian Socialism and trade unionism in general. As a devout Roman Catholic,Cooper, Henry R. 2003. A Bilingual Anthology of Slovene Literature. Bloomington, IN: Slavica, p. 251. he was however suspicious to the materialist world view present in most left-wing ideologies of the time, especially in Communism. By 1941 he had turned away from political activism, convinced that the only salvation for humanity was to be found in the Gospel. In the first months after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the Italian occupation of Ljubljana, he joined the illegal student organization of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, but left it soon afterwards, disturbed by its pro-Communist leanings. In June 1942, the Fascist authorities of the Italian-occupied Province of Ljubljana interned him in the Gonars concentration camp, together with several other nationalist students, including Zorko Simƒçiƒç and Marjan Tr≈°ar. He was released thanks to the intercession of Bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman in autumn of the same year. He returned to Ljubljana, and spent half a year in almost complete seclusion, mostly dedicating himself to writing. In March 1943, he joined the voluntary anti- communist militia sponsored by the Italians. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, he decided to enroll in the Slovenian Home Guard, an anti- communist militia sponsored by various Slovene conservative and anti- revolutionary political groups, which collaborated with the Nazi German occupying forces in the fight against the Slovenian Partisans. He was stationed as an officer at the Home Guard supply post in the village of Grahovo near Cerknica in 1943. The post was attacked, besieged, and burned down in an uneven fight between some 30 Home Guard troops and the ten-times larger Slovene Partisan Tom≈°iƒç Brigade. Balantiƒç died in the attack.  Work  Balantiƒç was an intimist and lyricist poet who wrote mystical and passionate poems. He was influenced by the work of the Slovene Romantic poet France Pre≈°eren, the decadentist poet Josip Murn, the expressionist Sreƒçko Kosovel, and especially the religious symbolism of Alojz Gradnik. Balantiƒç was a master of classic poetic forms, especially sonnets. His major poem was \\"Sonetni venec\\" (The Wreath of Sonnets, written in 1940) and published posthumously by the literary critic Tine Debeljak in 1944. The most typical trait of Balantiƒç's poetry is his unique blend of personalist and eschatological visions, in which a messianic sense of the tragic dissolution of civilization and the end of time is intertwined with premonitions of his own death and a strong erotic feeling. Most of his poems are a search towards a personal vision of Divinity, in connection with the tradition of Catholic mysticism. He developed a complex metaphorical-hermetical style, verging on manierism. In many ways, Balantiƒç continued the tradition of Slovene Christian expressionism, whose main exponents were Anton Vodnik and Edvard Kocbek, which, following the example of the writer Ivan Pregelj, he connected with elements of Baroque aestheticism.  Legacy  After World War II, all of his poetry was removed from public libraries in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and his name was omitted from public education. When the literary historian Anton Slodnjak mentioned Balantiƒç in his Review of Slovene Literature in the 1950s, he was fired from his post at the University of Ljubljana because of it. In 1966, a selection of Balantiƒç's poems were printed under the title Mu≈æevna steblika, but after intervention by the Communist Party it was decided that the book should be withdrawn and the entire run was sent to be destroyed and recycled. His poems were published among the Slovene diaspora, especially in Argentina, where the literary historians Tine Debeljak and France Pape≈æ edited and published most of his works. In the late 1980s, Balantiƒç was rediscovered in Slovenia, and he is now considered one of the foremost Slovene-language poets of the 20th century, along with Edvard Kocbek and Sreƒçko Kosovel.

It is a tree or shrub highly variable in its form, the size and shape of its leaves, in the number of flowers in a group and in the shape of its fruit. It is endemic to Hawaii. Description Myoporum sandwicense grows as either a small tree, large tree, or dwarf shrub, depending on the elevation and conditions. As a small tree, it reaches a height of with a trunk diameter of . The largest naio have a height of and a trunk diameter of . At the tree line, naio grows as a shrub. The bark on older specimens is often dark, rough and furrowed. The leaves are arranged alternately, often crowded near the ends of the stems, mostly long, wide, elliptic to lance-shaped and with a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface. Flowers are present all year and are arranged in groups of 2 to 6 in leaf axils on stalks long. They are a tubular bell shape with a fragrant odor and there are 5 lance-shaped sepals and 5 petals forming the tube. The tube is generally white or pink with darker blotches at the base of the lobes and the tube is usually long with lobes about the same length. The fruit is a waxy white drupe that is in diameter, juicy, and bitter to taste. The fruit usually dry out and remain attached to the branch. Taxonomy Myoporum sandwicense was first formally described in 1866 by Asa Gray and the description was published in Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The specific epithet sandwicense refers to the Sandwich Islands, the name given by James Cook to the Hawaiian Islands, where the type specimen was collected. There are two subspecies: *Myoporum sandwicense A.Gray subsp. sandwicense which occurs on all the Hawaiian Islands and has fruit which is oval to almost spherical; *Myoporum sandwicense subsp. lanaiensis (G.L.Webster) Chinnock which is only found on Lanai and has fruit which is cone-shaped to lens-shaped. In 1951 Grady Webster included a form found in the Cook Islands as Myoporum sandwicense subsp. wilderi but it is now known as Myoporum wilderi Skottsb. Some sources describe varieties including degeneri Webster, fauriei (Levl.) Kraenzlin, st.-johnii Webster, and stellatum Webster. In addition, a prostrate, shrubby variety known as naio papa (\\"flat naio\\") grows only at South Point on the island of Hawaii and is characterized by its similarities to creeping shrubs. Distribution and habitat The distribution of M. sandwicense in the United States is limited to the state of Hawaii. Within the state, it is found on all of the major islands at elevations from sea level to . Naio can be found in a variety of habitats, including low shrublands, dry forests, mesic forests, and wet forests, but is most common in subalpine shrublands. Uses =Indigenous uses= The finely-textured wood of M. sandwicense is hard and has a specific gravity of 0.55. Native Hawaiians, who called the wood aaka, used it to make manu (bow and stern ornamental end pieces) and pale (gunwales) for waa (outrigger canoes), pou (house posts), haha ka upena (fishing net spacers), and lamalama (long-burning torches for night fishing). The oily wood was also used as a substitute for iliahi (Santalum spp.) due to the similarity in smell when burned. =Horticulture= M. sandwicense can be cultivated using seeds separated from the fruit - the average germination time varies by reports but is most commonly noted as taking between six and eighteen months. Propagation by cuttings and air layering is also possible. =Other uses= For a short time in the 19th century after most Iliahi (Santalum freycinetianum) had been harvested, naio was exported to China, where it was made into incense and burned in Joss houses.

Life He followed for some time the cooper's trade. After a course of studies under of a distinguished ecclesiastic, Dr. Joseph Hirschel, he entered the seminary at Mainz. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1855, exercised for some time the ministry, and made a postgraduate course at Munich under Ignaz von D√∂llinger, and at Rome. In 1867 he was appointed to the chair of ecclesiastical history in the seminary of Mainz. He continued to teach until his elevation to the episcopate, with the exception of the years from 1878 to 1887, when seminary was closed by the order of the Government due to the Kulturkampf. In 1889 he became a canon of Mainz Cathedral; he received also several positions of trust in the administration of the diocese. In 1899 he was chosen Bishop of Mainz. Works Perhaps his best known work is his manual of church history, from \\"Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte\\" (Mainz, 1874; 8th ed., 1902). It has been translated into English, French, and Italian. The author showed himself possessed of extensive knowledge not only in history, but also in theology and canon law. A more special work is his \\"Geschichte der katholischen Kirche in Deutschland im neunzehnten Jahrhundert\\"‚ÄîHistory of the catholic Church in Germany in the Nineteenth Century\\", in five volumes (1887-1905).

It was built in 1887 from where the Adelaide station currently is to where the former Jubilee Exhibition Building was. The line used an existing tunnel under King William Road which was built in 1854 to transport horses and cattle. The tunnel is likely the origin of rumours about rail tunnels located under the city of Adelaide. Much of the land where the line once ran has been constructed over to build parts of Adelaide University and the Adelaide Festival Centre. There were no stations built. No known evidence of the line remains today. History King William Street The line was built for the Jubilee International Exhibition and used to transport exhibits, and during wartime transport troops from the parade ground to ships at Port Adelaide. It later served the Adelaide Showgrounds which were located on the east side of what is now the grounds of University of Adelaide. In 1927 when the Adelaide Showgrounds moved to Wayville the line was seen as redundant. The line was closed and the tunnel under King William Road filled in. In 1973, the tunnel was rediscovered when construction on the Adelaide Festival Centre was taking place. The section of the tunnel uncovered was lined with bluestone about 5 metres wide and at least 10 metres long. The Adelaide city council investigated whether it would be worth reopening the tunnel as a pedestrian subway to complement the new festival centre. The state government agreed to contribute $35,000 towards the opening of the tunnel. Subsequently the costing was found to be grossly underestimated at $90,000-$140,000 so the project was abandoned and the excavations refilled.

It is believed by Taoists that in the past the ability to write Shenfu had been once decreed by their deities to authorized priests or daoshi. * Lu () is a register and compilation of the membership of the daoshi as well as the skills they were able to use. These practitioners are also called Fulu Pai () or the Fulu Sect made up of daoshi from different schools or offshoots of Taojia.  Names  Different names for Fulu in English include Daoist magic writing, Daoist magic script characters, Daoist magic figures, Daoist magic formulas, Daoist secret talismanic writing, and talismanic characters.  General design  Fu symbols tend to have twisted strokes that sometimes resemble Traditional Chinese characters. Only Daoist priests can write, read, and understand this \\"magic\\" writing system and the characters can differ from Daoist sect to Daoist sect. The method of writing down these characters is passed down secretly from Daoist master to their disciples. According to these Daoist sects if \\"magic\\" writing were easy to understand then anyone could have the power to control the spirits. Some \\"magic\\" Fu script characters appear to have been formed by stacking one Traditional Chinese character atop of another Traditional Chinese character and then making these different characters into a single character. This specific technique of linking or combining different Chinese characters was not used exclusively by the Daoists, however, Fu characters also appear on other types of Chinese charms such as Buddhist coin charms and woodblock print charms.  Daoist scripture  One of the earliest classical scripture referring to Fu was the Huangdi Yinfujing (), although it does not contain specific instructions to write any talisman. The second chapter of each of the three grottoes in the Daozang is a record of the history and feats of the Fulu Sect, where it is described that the origin of Fu script is from the condensation of clouds in the sky.

Set in the swashbuckling era, the game puts the players in the control of a pirate ship with the goal of looting and capturing towns for a pirate faction, while defeating the enemy ships on the way. Gameplay Gameplay largely revolves around the maneuvering of a boat around a sea. The sea is made up of hexagons called Hexes. The player controls the boat by selecting a hex for a destination. If the ship becomes adjacent to a hex containing an enemy ship, merchant ship, town, or settlement, it will automatically attack it with cannon fire. Cannon damage depends on the number of upgrades, but if more than one enemy is adjacent, the ship will split its fire, firing at a different one each time. The objective is to capture a specific number of towns, which is given in mission briefing: the upper right corner of the screen displays the number cities owned, the ones owned by enemies, and the target number. The Pirate Lair can never be conquered by enemies, but the mission will end in failure if the enemies conquer the target number of towns before the player. To capture a town the player must be adjacent to it and bombard it until it has no health left; the town will continue to fire on the ship until the health is depleted. A town upgrade applies on both town health and cannon power. When health is depleted a \\"capture\\" bar shows, and when full the town will be conquered. If an enemy ship nears the town, the \\"capture\\" will be paused until one of the ship sinks or flees. Towns automatically heal adjacent ships of the same party, so a defending party has an advantage. Typical gameplay screenshot. Players control a 3D avatar of a pirate ship with colored sails depending on which team they are on. Ships have three attributes that can be upgraded: speed, armor, and cannon‚Äîeach of which can be upgraded up to three times. Speed determines how fast the player's ship sails, armor measures the amount of damage the ship can take before it is destroyed, and cannon measures the damage the ship can cause. The Cannon attribute is displayed over the ship as small circles under the life gauge. Upgrading attack strength also decreases speed. In the game, players use different resources to upgrade their towns and ships. There are three different resource types: gold, wood, and rum. 4 gold and 2 wood will upgrade a town, and 4 rum and 2 wood upgrade ships. Players can acquire resources by picking up boxes floating in the water, destroying enemy ships, plundering villages, using one of the four curses or capturing towns and using them to produce resources. Each town/village displays the resources it will produce with icons floating over its avatar. The player ship can only be upgraded in the Pirate Lair, but a town can be upgraded regardless of ship position. In the waters, merchant ships are frequently spawned, who attack any nearby ship, regardless of flag. While they do not have strong firepower nor hard hull, they release a curse crate when sunk. The player can only have one curse at a time, so if the crate is salvaged, it will give either a curse from 4 different types or a random resource. The four curses type are: * Bomb: Heavily damages anything within a hex, must be placed on an empty water hex * Whirlpool: Warps a ship to a random part of the map. * Ghost Ship: Makes the player ship invisible until cannons are next fired * Pilfer Monkey: Steals up to two resources of one type (Gold, Rum, or Wood) from an enemy depending on availability There are 7 different challenges for solo play, each featuring 3 differing maps of easy, medium and hard difficulty levels for a total of 21 single player missions. Multiplayer has a four-player game (Dueling Duos), six player game (Triple Trouble) and an eight-player game (Four By Four), which is all divided into two teams. There is also Battle Royale pitting 4 teams of two players against each other. Players can use voice chat to talk with their team. Capcom has also added 6 additional maps for free to download on PSN. The XBLA version includes Avatar support. Development Designer Max Hoberman admitted that inspiration for the game, came from Bungie's long-running April Fools' Day gag Pimps at Sea. An open beta went live on September 19, 2008 (International Talk Like a Pirate Day). On December 4, 2008, three additional map packs were released at no cost. Reception The Xbox 360 version of Age of Booty received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC and PlayStation 3 versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Eurogamer said the game's single-player mode was \\"frustrating and poorly balanced\\", but added, \\"take it online and you've got something that's almost worth the 800-Point asking price.\\" IT Reviews agreed, stating \\"It's cheaply priced and great fun to play online as the matches are quick and enjoyable, although the offline campaign is rather marred by the erratic computer AI.\\" The game was nominated for two Xbox Live Arcade 2008 awards: \\"Best Original Game\\" and \\"Best Competitive Multiplayer Game\\".

Bike Auckland (Bike AKL), formerly Cycle Action Auckland (CAA) is a pro-cycling advocacy group in Auckland, New Zealand. The volunteer group aims to improve infrastructure and conditions, as well as perceptions of cycling to encourage more \\"everyday people\\" to use bicycles, including for commuting and recreation. Affiliated with Cycling Action Network, the group focuses on Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. The group also more generally calls for increased funding for cycling infrastructure and safety measures. The former chairman (up until 2008) was Bevan Woodward. The current chair is Barbara Cuthbert. Activities Current campaigns and projects of CAA (as of 2010/2011) include working with Auckland Council to improve safety for cyclists and other users on Auckland's main roads, such as Tamaki Drive (one of the major cycling routes of Auckland, which also saw some high-profile accidents), working with the NZ Transport Agency on improvements to the Northwestern CyclewayNZTA closing the gap (NZ Transport Agency press release, Auckland Regional Office, 4 November 2009. Accessed 2009-11-08.) and other cycleway projects along motorways, such as the Waikaraka Cycleway sections around the new Manukau Harbour Bridge at Onehunga. In early 2010, the group also successfully helped convince North Shore City Council to retain the Lake Road cycle lanes after opponents had been campaigning for their removal, and had gotten over 2000 signatures against the lanes. An even larger counter- petition, as well as expert opinions on the efficacy of the lanes, were eventually successful in retaining them, and having cycling improvements included during further Lake Road upgrades. During 2010-2011, Cycle Action submitted in the Board of Inquiry approvals process for the Waterview Connection motorway project as a submitter and participated in transport and open space discussions with expert witnesses. The Board praised Cycle Action's 'detailed' and 'thoughtful' evidence and submission work. The Board eventually decided to favour arguments in support of a cycleway as part of the Waterview project, and had $8 million set aside towards construction. Another long-term aim is to get a cycle route crossing the Auckland Harbour Bridge, achieving a connection between the North Shore and the Auckland CBD, which at the moment do not have any cycle route connections between them save for bike transport via ferries. While there are close links, the GetAcross campaign is distinct from CAA. One of Bike Auckland's biggest recent successes was advocating for the conversion of the old Nelson Street motorway off-ramp to a new walk and cycleway, which was opened in late 2015. = Meetings and events = The group conducts monthly meetings, and supports a number of affiliated events and groups, such as with Frocks on Bikes, Campaign for Better Transport and other sustainability initiatives. It also organises pro-cycling rallies such as the 'Bikes for Life' event and cycling culture events such as the 'Cycle Style Gala'. In 2011, Cycle Action Auckland helped organise, together with Auckland Transport and NZ Transport Agency, the TelstraClear Challenge cycle race and community cycling festival, including rides over the Auckland Harbour Bridge and on the Northern Busway. The event took place 11 December. = Cycle Mapping = Together with ARTA, Cycle Action produced a comprehensive set of cycling maps for the Auckland Region in the late 2000s. They also cooperated with the Fullers ferry company to produce a similar map for Waiheke Island. Awards The group won a Cycle Friendly Award in 2004 for its commuter challenge held earlier that year.

His Father was Antoine Schyrgens (1890‚Äì1981), architect, draftsman, painter, teacher and a founder of the Beaux Arts Academy in Ostend. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts Ostend, and studied anatomy at Serge Mako's studio in Paris and in attended an Art College in Rome, Italy for three years. He traveled in Spain, the United States and Mexico before emigrating to Quebec in 1952. By the end of the Second World War his family was living in the south of France where Schyrgens staged his first exhibit at age 16. The family was very much involved in the local arts community. Schyrgens recalls Henri Matisse as a neighbor. As a youth Schyrgens was attracted to 'Commercial Art' and thought little of the established traditional artists. By the late 1940s Schyrgens was living in Spain where he believes he created his best works, inspired by Gypsy culture, music and dance. The young journeyman artist also traveled throughout Mexico. By 1952 he was living and working in Old Quebec City, where he became a Canadian citizen. He painted numerous street scenes as decoration for the stately Chateau Frontenac as he was doing the same as his livelihood. Over a nine-year period in Quebec City he produced hundreds of works, some of which were eventually sold through U.S. outlets. His work attracted moderate attention. He moved to Toronto, Ontario, where Toronto street scenes became his subject matter and again he was providing art for hotels, in this case the Royal York Hotel. In 1972, Schyrgens moved once more, becoming Kenora, Ontario's first Artist in Residence from 1972 to 1973. Sponsored with a grant from the Arts Council of Ontario for studio space, he helped found The Kenora Artists Association which numbered about 60 members and hosted studios for local artists and students. His influence had a profound effect on the local artists and he provided steady support to the neophytes who still regard him with profound respect. He uses some of this time in Kenora establishing a silk screen studio and experimented with wood and linoleum block printing which he utilized as the illustrator for a book (H.D. Thoreau, Walden or Life in the Woods) published by Poole Hall Press in 1977. 1981 found him in Winnipeg, where he established a studio and continued to produce colorful and dynamic street scenes. Between August and September 2007, the Lake of the Woods Museum, Kenora, Ontario hosted \\"Kenora Paintings by Jacques Schyrgens\\", a 40 watercolor retrospective of his works produced there. His product has produced reasonable prices at auction, and is in many private collections. Schyrgens was a member of the Artists Rights Society, and was a long-standing member of the not-for-profit organization Art Museum Image Consortium an educational resource available to universities, colleges, public libraries, elementary and secondary schools, and museums. Schyrgens has been shown in Brussels, Amsterdam, The Hage, Paris, London, Rome, Quebec City, Montreal, Winnipeg, and Kenora (Ont.).

Family Edward Villiers, born about 1585, was the second son of Sir George Villiers by his first wife, Audrey Saunders (d.1587), the daughter and heir of William Saunders (d. 14 July 1582) of Harrington, Northamptonshire by Frances Zouche, the daughter of William Zouche of Bulwick, Northamptonshire, son of John Zouche, 7th Baron Zouche (c.1440-1527) of Harringworth, who fought for Richard III at Bosworth. He had an elder brother, Sir William Villiers (d. 12 June 1629), created a baronet in 1619, who married Rebecca Roper, daughter and co-heir of Robert Roper, esquire, by Elizabeth Nott, the daughter of William Nott, esquire, of Thames Ditton; and three sisters, Elizabeth Villiers (d.1654), who married John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield; Anne Villiers, who married Sir William Washington, brother of Lawrence Washington, ancestor of George Washington; and Frances Villiers, who died without issue. By his father's second marriage he was a half-brother of James I's favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham; John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck; and Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey. Career Villiers was knighted on 7 September 1616. In October 1617, he succeeded Sir Richard Martin as Master of the Mint (until 1623), and in November 1618 he became comptroller of the Court of Wards. From 1623 until his death he was Warden of the Mint. On 30 December 1620 Villiers was elected as one of the members of parliament for Westminster. In the same month he was sent to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. to say that assistance would be given to him, but only on condition that he entered into an agreement to relinquish the crown of Bohemia. Villiers returned before May and took his seat in parliament, but was in that month temporarily excluded from the house for attempting to speak on the question of a patent, in which he was personally interested (the gold and silver patent in which Villiers had invested ¬£4,000 in 1617, and from which he derived an income of ¬£500 annually). His conduct was vindicated in the inquiry by the House of Lords in June, and Villiers was allowed to resume his seat in the Commons. In September he was again sent to the Elector Frederick, then serving with the Dutch army, to persuade him to withdraw from it and submit to the Holy Roman Emperor. On 23 September 1622 he was granted a lease of the customs and subsidies on gold and silver thread on condition of surrendering the mastership of the mint, but the latter office was restored to him in July 1624. He was re-elected as a member of parliament for Westminster on 22 January 1624 to sit in what became known as the Happy Parliament, and on 25 April 1625 to sit in the Useless Parliament. In August 1625 he asked the Commons to prevent a dissolution by desisting from their attack on his half-brother Buckingham. Meanwhile, James I, in January 1625, appointed Villiers Lord President of Munster; the appointment was confirmed by Charles I on 6 May, and in August Villiers went to Ireland to assume his duties. He held the post little over a year, and was absent for several months during that period. Villiers died in the college of Youghal, which he made his official residence, on 7 September 1626; he was buried in St. Mary's, Youghal. Marriage and issue Villiers married, circa 1612, Barbara St John, daughter of Sir John St John (c. 1552-1594) of Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire and Lucy Hungerford (1560-1598), daughter of Sir Walter Hungerford (c.1526-1596) of Farleigh Castle, Somerset, by Anne Dormer (1525-1603),A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: Hi-Hy, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 27 August 2013. by whom he had ten children. Villiers' wife was the niece of Oliver St John, created Viscount Grandison on 3 January 1612. Grandison had no issue, and Villier's half-brother, Buckingham, arranged for Villiers and his sons to inherit the Grandison title. Villier's eldest son William Villiers, who succeeded as 2nd Viscount Grandison in 1630, and was father of Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, mistress of Charles II. Villiers's second and third sons, John Villiers and George Villiers, succeeded as 3rd and 4th Viscounts Grandison.

Since reportage of both natural disasters and man- made disasters is commonplace, authors tend to be journalists who develop their news reports into books. While usually well written, they can lose sight of the causes, especially in man-made catastrophes where poor engineering, human error or negligence have combined to cause failure. On the other hand, authors who have been directly involved in an accident can reveal facts which have not been widely known, and provide insight into the problem. Examples An example of modern vintage is the publication of The High Girders in 1956 by the journalist John Prebble concerning Tay Bridge Disaster of December 28, 1879, one of the worst ever disasters on the rail network in Britain. It is a well composed book and written with good documentary accuracy, the author having accessed the many documents which have survived, especially the massive government report of 1880. On the other hand, he lacks confidence when discussing the engineering defects which lay at the heart of the accident. It did have a very positive benefit in stimulating others to write up their interpretation of the event, such as John Thomas in his New Light on the Tay Bridge Disaster published in 1972. He delved yet further into the archives and produced good evidence to show how faulty construction led directly to failure. Other recent authors such as Peter R Lewis in Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay (2004), have analysed the disaster from an engineering viewpoint, showing how design and construction defects led to destabilisation of the central part of the bridge. The sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912 was vividly recreated by Walter Lord in his A Night to Remember published in 1955, a book that became a best-seller and still remains in print for its accuracy and detail. It was later dramatised in a film of the same name, and most recently in a Hollywood epic. Lord followed it in 1986 with another book on the disaster, revealing testimony from survivors who had hitherto remained silent. His work also stimulated exploration of the wreck itself by Robert Ballard, and much new information emerged from the direct evidence. The ship had broken into two halves during the final stages of the disaster, and each separate part ended up well apart from one another.

Biography =Early life= Wood was born in 1912 in Strathalbyn, South Australia. He was the fourth son of Rev. Tom Percy Wood (1880‚Äì1957) and Fannie (n√©e Newbury, 1880‚Äì1969). His elder brother, Rex Wood (1906‚Äì1970) was also a noted artist. His grandfather, Thomas Percy Wood (1855‚Äì1937) was an accomplished watercolourist (Ref: State Library of South Australia). Noel Wood attended Art School in Adelaide where his tutor was Marie Tuck. =Career= Wood was a prolific landscape painter well known for his island lifestyle. His work was spontaneous and colourful in response to his tropical surroundings and is found in many public and private collections in Australia and overseas. He was also a noted portrait painter. He exhibited regularly in Adelaide and Sydney. Noel met Eleanor Weld Skipper, whom he married in 1933, at Art School in Adelaide and they lived and painted on Kangaroo Island, S.A., residing in the house of Noel's brother, Dean, for two years before setting out in a T-model Ford 'to find an island of their own'. They purchased 15 acres on Bedarra Island, North Queensland and made a grass shack in which to live before building a home they called the \\"House of Singing Bamboo\\" (sadly non- existent after Cyclone Yasi). They had two daughters, Virginia Maray and Ann Oenone. Noel lived on the island for 60 years. After painting just about everything on Bedarra, he became a well-known sight in Tully and on Dunk Island with boards strapped to his back, heading out to paint. At one stage he also taught art classes in Tully, sailing over to Tully Heads in his small craft. He was always interested in permaculture and established productive gardens including every coconut palm and all other fruiting trees to be seen on his part of the island. Despite coping with death adders, echidnas and megapodes on land; hungry birds daily sweeping down from the skies; insects munching his tender greens; searching the beaches for materials to use for building his house and introducing goats, hens and guinea fowl ‚Äì not to mention chatting with his many visitors, particularly the press, he still painted prodigiously every day. During WW2, Wood packaged fifty of his best paintings to exhibit in London at Leicester Galleries as soon as the War ended. The exhibition was to be opened by the British painter Augustus John. The crate of works was despatched on Queensland Rail but went missing en route and never reached Sydney, where Wood awaited them. It was never found. Bitterly disappointed, Wood took ship to London, anyway, and he painted in England, Ireland, France and Italy, paying his way by producing portraits, until returning to Bedarra to tend to his food gardens, wild hens and fruit trees ‚Äì and to paint, of course. In the 1950s, he was invited to the United States where he worked as an assistant art director in Hollywood and continued with his own painting before, once again, returning to the island. By 1972, Wood had finished painting, preferring to read, garden and converse with his visitors. Eventually, in the 1990s, he left his beloved hideaway for the mainland but, restless and missing the island, he moved four times, always establishing a food garden. =Death= Noel Wood died in Tully, North Queensland, in 2001 at the age of 89. His daughter, Ann, makes this comment: \\"Dad painted every day, mostly on an easel, most often outdoors, and never looked at his palette while he painted ‚Äì even when he was mixing the paint! He was resourceful, a voracious reader, a great cook, and wasn‚Äôt concerned about leading a 'regular' life. The island was his paradise, his bolthole, he knew every inch of it and he loved it.\\"  References  Further reading *\\"A Big Country\\" Stories of Australia and its people from the ABC TV series by Jim Downes.

She has represented New Zealand in both netball as a Silver Fern and rugby union as a member of the Black Ferns. Early and personal life Born in Taupo, Wall has NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa, Ngati Hineuru and Waikato ancestry. She was named after her father's cousin Louis, who died on the day she was born. She attended secondary school at Taupo-nui-a-Tia College and earned qualifications from the Waikato Institute of Technology and the University of Waikato (Certificate and Diploma in Sport and Recreation) and Massey University (Bachelor of Social Policy and Social Work; M. Phil (Social Policy)). She worked in the health field. She is openly lesbian and is a strong advocate for human rights.  Political career  In the Wall stood unsuccessfully in the electorate and occupied the 46th position on the Labour list. Wall became a Labour Party member of parliament on 4 March 2008 to replace retiring list MP Ann Hartley. In the , she unsuccessfully stood in TƒÅmaki Makaurau, against MƒÅori Party leader Pita Sharples. Wall returned to Parliament as a Labour List MP after Darren Hughes resigned, as she had been selected in December 2010 to represent Labour in due to the retirement of George Hawkins. Serving in the 49th New Zealand Parliament, she subsequently won the electorate in the and returned to the 50th New Zealand Parliament. She continued to hold Manurewa by a comfortable margin in both the 2014 and 2017 elections. Wall was nominated by the Manurewa Local Electorate Committee for reselection as the Labour candidate for Manurewa at the 2020 general election. Arena Williams and Ian Dunwoodie challenged Wall for the party selection. Dunwoodie had previously run for selection in 2010, but lost to Wall. Arena Williams, who was mentored by Grant Robertson, submitted her nomination after the advertised deadline. The selection was scheduled to be held on 21 March 2020, but was delayed due to the late nomination of Arena Williams and a challenge by Ian Dunwoodie to the Local Electorate Committee participation on the Selection Panel. On 9 May 2020 the NZ Council of the Labour Party accepted Arena William's nomination and removed the Local Electorate Committee representation from the Selection Panel. Wall sought legal advice which she shared with the NZ Council and suggested internal resolution. However the NZ Council rescheduled the selection for 30 May and following discussions with the Party over the legal issues, Wall withdrew her nomination as a candidate for the Manurewa electorate to run as a list only candidate confirmed at number 29. In 2013 Wall lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission over two cartoons by Al Nisbet published by Fairfax NZ Ltd relating to the extension of the Government's breakfast in schools programme. The Human Rights Commission took no action and Wall referred the matter to the Human Rights Review Tribunal which found the cartoons insulting in their depiction of Maori and Pasifika but did not amount to a breach of s.61 of the Human Rights Act 1993. Wall appealed the decision which was the first time the High Court had considered s.61. While the High Court did not overturn the Tribunal's decision it found the cartoons were objectively offensive and observed there should be a cause for reflection by Fairfax and their editorial teams. The Court found Wall had raised important issues of public interest and no costs award was made.Wall v Fairfax New Zealand Limited [2018]NZHC 104  Same-sex marriage  In May 2012, Wall submitted a Bill to legalise same-sex marriage in New Zealand to the Member's bill ballot. It was subsequently drawn and introduced to Parliament in late July 2012. On 29 August 2012, the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill passed its first reading with a vote of 80‚Äì40. On 17 April 2013, the Bill was passed into law by 77 votes to 44, making New Zealand the 13th nation to allow same-sex marriage. The Bill came into effect on 19 August 2013; since then, married same sex couples in New Zealand have been able to adopt children jointly.

The novel portrays the stages of grief in relation to the passage of time. It won both the Scottish Arts Council Book Award (2001) and the Encore Award (2002). Plot introduction There are five characters, two relatives, three strangers, but all female. There is a homeless woman, a hotel receptionist, a hotel critic, the ghost of a hotel chambermaid, and the ghost's sister. These women tell a story, and it is through this story that unbeknownst to them their lives and fates intersect. The catalyst of their story is the Global Hotel. Explanation of the novel's title The title of Ali Smith's novel Hotel World is a metaphor for life's passage through time, and the moments which escape us all too quickly. Every hour of every day, a hotel somewhere is checking in a new guest, or ‚Äúlife‚Äù, just as quickly as one is checking out. In titling her novel Hotel World, Smith not only references the homogeneity imposed on society through hotel corporations, but also emphasizes an impermanent or indefinite state in life. The question then arises of what life would be if we were mere observers, watching countless lives check in and out of this same predetermined world, this hotel world. Does the presence or absence of those we love shape the moments that mould our world? Plot summary Hotel World is divided into five sections. The first section, ‚ÄúPast‚Äù tells the story of Sara Wilby The second part, \\"Present Historic\\", is about a homeless girl (Else) begging for money outside the Hotel. The ‚ÄúFuture Conditional‚Äù, the third section of the novel, Lise, a receptionist. The fourth part is ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù with its far from perfect character Penny. The fifth section of the novel titled ‚ÄúFuture in the Past,‚Äù is entirely Clare's memories on the life and death of her sister Sara. ‚ÄúPresent‚Äù is the title of the last part of the novel. Characters in \\"Hotel World\\" Hotel World is told from the perspective of five different women who as fate would have it cross paths and in doing so affect each other's lives through moments spent together. Each character is unique in that they each signify a different stage of the grieving process, a theme prevalent throughout the entire novel. Sara Wilby ‚Äì a teenage hotel chambermaid who has fallen to her death in a hotel dumbwaiter. She is the daughter to her parents Mr. and Mrs. Wilby, and also older sister to Clare. Elspeth Freeman ‚Äì an older homeless woman suffering from tuberculosis, she daily sits on the streets begging the people passing by to ‚Äúspare some change.‚Äù When first introduced to the reader, Elspeth is referred to only as Else. The character of Else signifies anger, the second stage in the grieving process. Lise ‚Äì a receptionist for the Global Hotel, Lise was responsible for inviting Else, the homeless woman, to spend a night there. Penny Warner ‚Äì A reporter and journalist, Penny is a paying guest to the Global Hotel, there to review its services. Clare Wilby ‚Äì the younger sister to Sara, Clare is not entirely introduced until the last section of the novel. Clare's character signifies the final stage in the grieving process, that of acceptance. Duncan ‚Äì He was the sole witness to Sara's death. As the novel's only dominant male character, Duncan appears in each story within the novel. He too is moved to an emotional state of depression after witnessing the tragedy. Including Duncan in each of the novel's stories, Smith seems to imply that these stages of grief may affect mere observers too, that these stages are not exclusive to family or close personal friends of those who have died. Major themes =Grief= The sudden death of Sara Wilby transforms this novel into a healing process. It both signifies and addresses each stage in grieving. =Passage of Time= In one moment one life has ended. In one night a woman's status has changed. In six months depression deteriorates the mind. And through the course of time, a sister's acceptance is gained. All these individual experiences characterize moments endured by Smith's characters in her novel Hotel World. The experience of these moments and the passage of time that they represent express the theme that time truly is of the essence. Just as quickly as these moments shape a life, they leave a life too, never returned. Why then don't we live when given the chance, and why is it that in dying one never feels more alive? Smith addresses these questions through her formal writing choices. Her sentence structure or complete lack of structure, the immediacy she imparts on her text, the words she chooses to forget, and the way she structures her novel's chapters as grammatical tenses of time all communicate the sense that time is passing. Moments pass by, memories are made then forgotten, people continue to check in and out, and time is the only thing keeping track. ‚ÄúWhat a life. What a time. What I felt. Then. Gone.‚Äù (3). =Sexuality/Sexual awakening (lesbian)= Though it never comes to fruition in the novel, Sara Wilby's sexual awakening when she meets the girl in the watch shop‚Äîand the girl's shared interest in Sara, which is only conveyed briefly near the end of the novel‚Äîreveal a very internal coming out process for both women as each recognizes in herself her potential as a sexual being attracted to the same sex. Sara Wilby's early reluctant awareness of her attraction, and her subsequent somewhat obsessive observing of the watch shop girl, echo the recurring theme of watching and observing in the novel, and simultaneously convey the hope and complexity associated with recognizing one's queer self. =Societal Acceptance= Smith uses unique characteristics for each woman giving her novel the feeling of being an observation on society. =Homogeneous Society= Smith explores the idea of a homogeneous society by focusing her plot on the world of a hotel. A hotel corporation implies a sense of sameness. Regardless of location, the service provided, the architecture of their buildings, and the ideal life they attempt to sell, hotel corporations all mimic each other. Forcing a false reality on its visitors, hotels act as a pause in time. Continually checking in and out, guests never achieve a sense of permanence in their stay, thus never find a home in a hotel. While hotels strive for homogeneity, there is nothing real or pure behind their corporations. Smith is not only critiquing this but also commenting that if homogeneity was achieved in actual society there would be no purity left. =Hierarchal Society= Smith implies there is a hierarchical structure to society, by setting her entire novel in a luxurious hotel. Literary significance and reception Acclaimed as a truly inventive novel, Hotel World received much praise for its unique storyline and distinct formal choices. Garnered as a rare novel filled with hope and despair, Hotel World‚Äôs characters, linguistic choices, and thematic elements are what have set it apart as a genuinely modernist -- and some would argue postmodern -- piece of literature. Allusions and references Ali Smith includes several quotes and short poems at the start of the book which are reflective of the themes of the novel. *Muriel Spark says ‚Äúremember you must die‚Äù (in her 1959 novel Memento Mori) meaning people should appreciate life to its full potential because it will one day end. This quote ties into the theme about the passage of time, and is also reminiscent of Smith's recurrent ‚Äúremember you must live.‚Äù *William Blake describes ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù as being ‚Äúeternal delight.‚Äù Ghosts are thought by some to be the body's energy which forever preserved, which means that a ghost, or any form of life after death, is thus viewed as eternally delightful because they will persist forever. *Edwin Muir‚Äôs poem that speaks about the ‚Äúunfriendly universe‚Äù also ties into the theme of the passage of time. It describes \\"the miracle‚Äù as being the point where people are able to let go. Smith also makes reference to Todd Solondz's 1998 film Happiness, a controversial film which deals with sexuality and isolation and their difficult relationship to each other.

History Depicting Dioni and Zeus (left) and a bull (right). The coalition was established between 370 and 320 BC (firstly as the Molossian League in 370 BC), which helped unify the three main tribes of Epirus (i.e., Molossians, Thesprotians, and Chaonians). The political, economic, and cultural center of the Epirote League was Dodona. Dodone was the religious, political and cultural centre of the Molossian League and later of the Epirote League. Pyrrhus of Epirus became leader of the League in 297 BC. When King Agathocles of Syracuse conquered Corcyra, he offered the island as dowry to his daughter Lanassa on her marriage to Pyrrhus of Epirus in 295 BC.; . The island then became a member of the Epirote League. It was then perhaps that the settlement of Cassiope was founded to serve as a base for the king of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirote League until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of Alexander II of Epirus. The league was defeated by the Illyrians during the Battle of Phoenice, which forced it to enter into an alliance with Teuta to prevent further attacks. This alliance made the Epirotes hostile to the Achaeans and Aetolians, but it presumably ended following the Illyrian defeat in the First Illyrian War. Although the Epirote League remained neutral in the first two Macedonian Wars, it was ultimately dismantled in the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians supporting the Roman Republic. Decrees of the League Copies of the decrees (proxeny and citizenship decrees, manumission records) of the Molossian and Epirote League were set up in Dodona. All members had common citizenship. Regarding the dialect of the Epirote League, it was not Corinthian Doric and even the alphabet was not Corinthian; it was probably Northwest Doric, as some recorded inquiries at Dodona appear to indicate..

Production was small scale at first but became increasingly large-scale and standardized until the Soviet era, which placed emphasis on quantity rather than quality and differentiated the industry into three parts, growers, fermenters and bottlers.

The town was originally a private subdivision of Section 52, and named for the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. When the amalgamated District Council of Keyneton and Swan Reach was established in 1933, Sedan was chosen to be the seat of council. Later the council name was changed to reflect the seat, becoming the District Council of Sedan. Pine Hut Creek Pine Hut Creek and Pine Hut Plain are historic names for areas to the south of the township in the locality of Sedan. The creek flows from the eastern side of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the Murray River. There was once a Congregational Church school which closed in 1880 and government school from 1900 to 1910. There is a small cemetery no longer used.

Wushu is characterized by low, wide stances designed for mobility and protection. Stability is another key concern of Chinese martial arts, and the wushu stances reflect this sensibility. There are five key stances utilized in both contemporary wushu and traditional wushu. Many others exist, and different styles of wushu prescribe a particular protocol for \\"correct\\" stance. Contemporary wushu stances In contemporary wushu there are five basic stances: \\"Gong Bu\\" (bow stance), \\"Ma Bu\\" (horse stance), \\"Xie Bu\\" (rest stance), \\"Pu Bu\\" (flat stance), and \\"Xu Bu\\" (false stance). =M«é B√π (È¶¨Ê≠•)= Ma Bu, known as \\"horse stance\\" or \\"horse-riding stance,\\" is a fundamental stance found in nearly all styles of wushu. In actual attack and defense, Ma Bu is sometimes viewed as a transitional stance, from which a practitioner may quickly switch to other stances. The stance typically begins with the feet apart slightly wider than shoulder-width. The feet are parallel, straight forward, and the knees are bent at 90 degrees. The torso sinks down as if following a plumb line and the sacrum curves forward and in or arches. Equal weighting (50-50) is given to each foot, making for a very stable stance. Ma Bu is frequently used for conditioning and building up knee strength. Many kung fu masters required students to be able to hold Ma Bu for at least five minutes before learning the forms of a style. Different styles of kung fu often teach variations on the horse stance. For instance, in b√°i h√® qu√°n (ÁôΩÈ∂¥Êã≥), the knees are bent inward and almost touching, unaligned with the toes. =G≈çng B√π (ÂºìÊ≠•Ôºâ= Translated as \\"bow stance\\", Gong Bu is also known as \\"Deng Shan Bu\\" (mountain-climbing stance) or \\"Gong Jian Bu\\" (bow and arrow stance). The lead foot is pointed straight ahead, with the lead leg bent at a 90 degree angle. The trailing foot is angled outward at a 45 degree angle, with the heel lined up with the heel of the leading foot. The trailing leg can be held slightly bent but is usually held straight. The result is a \\"lunging\\" pose. In southern styles, the toe is if it had stayed in Ma Bu; starting in Ma Bu, the hind leg steps forward and turns while the front leg stays in the same position. In northern styles, the toe points forward. The given weighting is 70% on the front foot and 30% on the rear. In application, it is popularly used for attacking. The structure of the stance partially protects the groin and allows the martial artist to punch with greater power by driving the rear leg into the ground. Additionally, the rear leg can be quickly drawn forward for kicking attacks. =F√∫ H«î B√π Ôºà‰ºèËôéÊ≠•Ôºâ= Fu Hu Bu is translated as ‚Äútame the tiger stance.‚Äù Other names include ‚Äúdrop stance‚Äù or Pu Bu (‰ªÜÊ≠•), ‚Äúflat stance.‚Äù According to changquan master Yang Jwing-Ming, the stance was named after a martial artist named Wu Song, who slew a leaping tiger with the stance during the Song Dynasty. In this position, the martial artist squats on one leg until the thigh is parallel to the ground and extends the other leg out to the side. Both feet are parallel and pointing forward, relative to the torso, and like Zuo Pan Bu, the practitioner faces the opponent with his/her side. Versatile in application, Fu Hu Bu can be employed for both attack and defense. A primary application of this stance is defense against high or jumping kicks, as evidenced in the Taiji technique ‚ÄúStrike the Tiger.‚Äù Baguazhang and Taiji forms also use the stance for low hand attacks, such as ‚ÄúSnake Creeps Down‚Äù from the Yang-style taijiquan sequence. With Northern Praying Mantis, Fu Hu Bu is applied in Ba Bu Gan Chan (ÂÖ´Ê≠•ÂππËü¨), a leaping attack to the opponent's ankle with the foot. In traditional changquan forms, such as Yi Lu Mai Fu, the stance is used to pick up objects from ground for use as projectiles during combat. As with Ma Bu, different styles assume Fu Hu Bu in differing ways. =Xu√°n Jƒ´ B√π ÔºàÁéÑÊ©üÊ≠•Ôºâ= Xuan Ji Bu is rendered as the ‚Äúfalse‚Äù or ‚Äútricky leg‚Äù stance, associated with kicking attacks. Popular alternative labels include the \\"empty stance\\" (Xu Bu) or \\"cat stance‚Äù (Mao Bu). Xuan Ji Bu is assumed by placing one's entire body weight on a single leg and extending the other leg in front to lightly touch the ground. Since the frontal leg has no weight placed on it, it can be used to launch fast kicks. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other stances for evasive actions. =Zu√≤ P√°n B√π ÔºàÂùêÁõ§Ê≠•Ôºâ= Zuo Pan Bu (interpreted as ‚Äúsitting on crossed legs stance‚Äù) is known by a number of names, such as the contemporary wushu ‚Äúcross stance‚Äù or ‚Äúrest stance.‚Äù It can be assumed by beginning in Ma Bu, pivoting counterclockwise on the right toe, and crouching down with the back straight. The result is a cross-legged stance that can be used for initiating attacks or defending, while facing the opponent with one's side. The crossed legs protect the groin from attacks and prepare the practitioner for a side kick. More importantly, Zuo Pan Bu is the basis for Xie Bu (ËüπÊ≠• literally ‚Äúcrab walking‚Äù), which is also called ‚Äúclandestine steps.‚Äù Crab walking is performing by alternating assuming Zuo Pan Bu and Ma Bu, moving to one side. From Ma Bu, stepping to the side with either leg effects a transition to Zuo Pan Bu. Using the other leg, the next step to the side returns the practitioner to Ma Bu and the process iterates. The overall effect is rapid movement to one side. Nearly all combat applications of Zuo Pan Bu involve Xie Bu to some degree. Traditional wushu stances The five stances‚ÄîMa Bu, Deng Shan Bu, Zuo Pan Bu, Fu Hu Bu, and Xuan Ji Bu‚Äîare the five basic stances taught in contemporary wushu, the sport established by the People's Republic of China. Contemporary wushu practitioners often perform stances such as Ma Bu and Deng Shan Bu lower than traditional wushu practitioners. In contrast, Northern traditional wushu masters usually teach higher, more practical versions of all five stances and a number of other stances, most notably Si-Liu Bu, Jin Ji Du Li, Tun Bu, and Qi Lin Bu. =S√¨ Li√π b√π ÔºàÂõõÂÖ≠Ê≠•Ôºâ= Si-Liu Bu is the ‚Äúfour-six stance,‚Äù used heavily as a defensive posture. It is named for the fact that 40% of the weight is on the leading foot and 60% on the rear foot. The stance is somewhat similar to Deng Shan Bu, with the exception of the greater weight distribution over the rear leg. The lead foot is oriented slightly to its opposite side (left foot gravitates right; vice versa) and the rear foot is almost aligned with it. The rear knee is turned inward toward the groin and the front knee is bent. Si-Liu Bu is a highly functional stance that often serves as a standard guard position in many styles of wushu; it has great utility, allowing the martial artist to initiate nearly any technique in this stance. From Si-Liu Bu, one may switch to any one of the other stances with minimal effort. The stance is highly mobile, used for swiftly stepping forward or backwards, ‚Äúchanging legs,‚Äù or leaping to the other side of an opponent. A number of jumping techniques are also executed from Si-Liu Bu, such as Yiou Bu. Translated as ‚Äúhop jump,‚Äù Yiou Bu is used to either advance or retreat over a short distance. It is essentially a large hop forwards or backwards, propelled by a thrust from the back or front leg, respectively. Because of the large spread of the legs, Si-Li Bu is an extremely stable stance. =Jin Ji Du Li ÔºàÈáëÈõûÁç®Á´ãÔºâ= Jin Ji Du Li, translated as ‚Äúgolden rooster stands on one leg,‚Äù is popularly known as the crane stance, used heavily in karate. It is formed by raising one knee to its maximum height. The facing can be either to the front or the side, relative to the opponent. As with karate, Jin Ji Du Li is used as a platform for frontal kicks, as well as side kicks. It is also frequently employed defensively to deflect low to middle height kicks. Lastly, it is used in Northern styles for Tiao Bu (‚Äújump step‚Äù) and Dan Tiao (‚Äúsingle-jump‚Äù), two techniques of movement for advance or retreat. It is also known as the crane stance in many martial arts. =T≈´n B√π ÔºàÂêûÊ≠•Ôºâ= Most clearly associated with Northern praying mantis, Tun Bu is the ‚Äúswallow stance,‚Äù related to Fu Hu Bu. Like the former, it can be used to defend against jump attacks. It is formed by squatting on a single leg until the thigh is parallel to the ground and extending the other foot to touch the ground. Unlike Fu Hu Bu, the extended foot contacts the ground with only the heel and faces forward. This stance can be used to trap the opponent's foot to set up a shuai jiao technique. Punches and kicks, as well as jump kicks, can be executed easily from Tun Bu. Most praying mantis exponents assume a higher version of Tun Bu, in which the thigh is not parallel to the ground. =Qi Lin Bu ÔºàÈ∫íÈ∫üÊ≠•Ôºâ= Qi Lin Bu is the ‚Äúunicorn stance,‚Äù used primarily in changquan and Northern praying mantis. It is similar in appearance to Zuo Pan Bu, with the exception that the frontal foot's toes point to the left or right. Also, the exponent's front faces the opponent. In changquan forms such as Shi Zi Tang (ÂçÅÂ≠óË∂ü), it is employed as a low platform from which to execute uppercuts and front kicks. Furthermore, it is used evasively for straight-line retreats.

The offensive failed, due to strong resistance by the Wehrmacht. As a result, it is largely known through German accounts of the defense and because of the atrocities that were committed by troops of the 11th Guards Army, most notably the Nemmersdorf massacre. Planning The operation was planned as a result of the success of the Memel Offensive Operation to the north. The troops of the 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian Fronts had succeeded in pushing the Third Panzer Army back to the East Prussian border, surrounding the city of Memel and reaching the shore of the Curonian Lagoon. Stavka permitted Chernyakhovsky to further exploit this success by attacking along the Gumbinnen ‚Äì Insterburg ‚Äì K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) axis deep into East Prussia. Chernyakhovsky's plan involved using the 11th Guards and 5th Armies to break open the German defensive lines, before pushing through exploitation forces from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 28th Army. The 31st and 39th Armies would advance on the flanks of the main force. The opposing German forces, from the Third Panzer and Fourth Armies, were aided by the presence of substantial fortifications, and had been heavily reinforced.

The flanking armies commenced operations the next day, by which time units of the 11th Guards Army had crossed the East Prussian border. German troops on the outskirts of Go≈Çdap, retaken on 3 November 1944 The Soviet troops ran into extremely strong resistance. It took them four days to penetrate the initial tactical defenses, while the second defense line was so strong that Chernyakhovsky was compelled to commit the 2nd Guards Tank Corps to break it. Casualties were extremely heavy. On 20 October, the second line was ruptured by the 11th Guards Army and 2nd Guards Tank Corps east of Gumbinnen, defended by the guns of the 18th Anti-Aircraft Division and the Fallschirm-Panzerdivision Hermann G√∂ring, which had been redeployed in the area to counter the Soviet advance. On 21 October, the Soviets' reserve, the 28th Army, was committed, but the offensive in the north was fought to a standstill in the region of Ebenrode thanks to some effective German counter- attacks. Gumbinnen was taken by 22 October, but retaken by German forces on the 24 October, after the Germans committed the 5th Panzer Division, and Heavy Panzer Detachment 505 (equipped with Tiger IIs). Also Nemmersdorf (located on the banks of the Angrapa River) was taken by units of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps on the 21 October, but already retaken by German forces on the 23 October. Units of 11th Guards Army found themselves cut off in the area of Gro√üwaltersdorf, and were involved in intense fighting. In the meantime, the Germans had pressed more reserves, including the 102nd Panzer and F√ºhrer Grenadier Brigades into counter-attacks at Goldap, on the southern sector of the Soviet penetration. The town was retaken on 25 October. The Soviet attacks continued until 27 October, as the flanking armies sought to close up to the 11th Guards Army. There was more fighting in the operation's immediate aftermath: on 28 October, the 31st Army retook Go≈Çdap in a surprise attack; the town was again taken by the 5th Panzer Division, which was redeployed from the Gumbinnen area, on 3 November.

He started as quarterback for the Texas Longhorns for almost 2¬Ω seasons, 1985-87 during which time he established 14 UT records, among them most passing yards in a season (2,233) in 1986, and most passing yards over a career (4,735). However, most of his records have since been surpassed by Peter Gardere, James Brown, Major Applewhite, and Vince Young. Early life Bret Stafford was a talented athlete who spent his life surrounded by sports. A native of Amarillo, Texas, Stafford's family moved to Temple in 1972, where his father, Dick Stafford, a former Texas Tech football player, served as offensive coordinator to Bob McQueen at Temple High School and his mother was a Middle School girl's coach. Bret Stafford had an immediate impact on the Wildcats varsity, starting as a freshman, never losing a district title game, and playing on a team that won the state title in 1979. That team starred QB Robbie Harris and future NFL running back Kenneth Davis. At Temple, he was all-district in 1980 and 1981 and All-Central Texas as a quarterback. He was also all-district and all-central Texas in baseball and he made it to the 4A state championship race in the 300-meter hurdles, finishing 6th one year and winning in 1982. However, after Dick Stafford accepted the head coach job at Belton in the spring of 1982, Bret Stafford left Temple, too. At Belton, he was again an all-district QB, and also made the all-state team and was a Parade All-American. He again ran track, winning the state championship in the 300-meter hurdles with the 5th fastest time in the nation by a high school athlete in that event that year and earning All-American honors. He also made the all-district baseball team again for two years as a center fielder. Because of his abilities, he was picked by one recruiting magazine as the state's all-around best athlete in 1983.< Sports Information Bio> In 1983, he played free safety in the Texas High-School All-Star game. In 2007, Stafford was inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame. College career Highly recruited for football and scouted by major league teams in baseball, Stafford accepted a scholarship offer by the University of Texas, turning down offers from Texas A&M; and Texas Tech. After redshirting the 1983 season, Stafford was a back-up to Todd Dodge in 1984, a season when the Longhorns spent two weeks ranked #1. Stafford went in to replace Dodge in two games that season, after Dodge threw a school record 5th interception against Houston, and in the second half of a loss to Texas A&M.; In the spring of 1985, Stafford struggled so much at quarterbacking that the coaching staff considered moving him to defensive back, but by the summer, Dodge and Stafford were in the middle of a heated quarterback battle that Stafford would eventually win. Stafford got his first career start against Missouri, though he and Dodge shared snaps. Stafford started every game that season, but Dodge played often, sometimes more than Stafford. Against Oklahoma Stafford only lasted 6 plays before being pulled for Dodge. When Dodge failed to impress, Stafford started again the next week, and led the Longhorns to an upset of #4 Arkansas. With him at quarterback, the Longhorns had an 8-4 record and went to the 1985 Bluebonnet Bowl where they lost to #11 Air Force. In 1986, Stafford entered as the undisputed starter of a team that was unranked all year. The Longhorns struggled to a 5-6 record and missed out on a bowl game. Stafford threw for 2256 yards, with 15 interceptions and 12 touchdowns. Following the season, head coach Fred Akers was fired and replaced with David McWilliams. In the spring, Stafford had elbow surgery. In his senior season, Stafford was again the starter - and a near unanimous pre-season pick for all-SWC, but after being injured in the game against BYU and again against Houston, he shared significant playing time with Shannon Kelley, who would start against TCU. The Longhorns went 6-5, including an upset win over #15 Arkansas and losses to both #1 Oklahoma and #5 Auburn. Stafford suffered a concussion and a broken tooth when he was hit out-of-bounds in the BYU game, and had to sit out the rest of the game. He almost had to have his jaw wired shut as a result. The Arkansas game was won on an 18-yard touchdown pass from Bret Stafford to WR Tony Jones on the last play of the game, the first time in Longhorn history that a game was won on the last play of the game. After injuring himself in an attempt to prevent an interception from being returned for a touchdown, Stafford left the Houston game with the Longhorns up 24-20, but they fell apart without him losing 60-40. He then sat out the TCU game the next week. Nonetheless, Texas entered the final week with a chance to win the Southwest Conference Championship, but they lost to Texas A&M; on a late touchdown. The team went to the 1987 Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl where Stafford led the Longhorns to a 32-27 win over Pittsburgh in his last game and the last ever Bluebonnet Bowl. He threw for 368 yards and three touchdowns with 1 interception. Stafford graduated with 16 Longhorn records, and was the school's the all-time leader in passing yards. His record as a starter was 19-15. =Records= * UT - Longest run by a quarterback (74 yards), surpassed by Vince Young * UT - Fastest to 1,000 yards in a single season (5 games) tied by Peter Gardere in 1992 and Shea Morenz in 1994, surpassed by James Brown in 1995 * UT - Highest Completion Percentage (min 100 attempts) (55.6%), season, surpassed by Gardere in 1989 * UT - 300 yard total offense games, career (2), tied Donnie Little, surpassed by Brown in 1995 * UT - Pass attempts, Game (42), broke his own record, tied by Morenz in 1993 and then broken by him in the same year * UT - Pass attempts, Season (224), surpassed by Gardere in 1990 * UT - Pass attempts, career (718), surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Pass completions, Game (20), on three occasions, tied by Gardere in 1990 and again in 1991, surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Pass completions, Season (120), surpassed by Gardere in 1990 * UT - Pass completions, Career (378), surpassed by Gardere in 1991 * UT - Lowest percentage of passes intercepted (minimum 300 passes), career (4.9%), surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Passes intercepted, Game (5) tied with Zeke Martin, Todd Dodge, Garrett Gilbert * UT - Passing Yards, Bowl game (368), 1987 Bluebonnet Bowl, surpassed by Applewhite in 2001 * UT - Passing Yards, Season (2,233), surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Passing Yards, Career (4,735), surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Total Offense, Season (2,472), surpassed By Brown in 1996 * UT - Total Offense, Career (5,379), surpassed by Gardere in 1992 * UT - Quarterback starts, career (34), tied Bobby Layne and Marty Akins, surpassed by Peter Gardere in 1992The official records have Akins at 36 starts, but that appears to be an error, as they set his record at 26-9 and appear to be including the Wyoming game in 1974.

It contains ordinal notations for every recursive ordinal, that is, ordinals below Church‚ÄìKleene ordinal, \\\\omega_1^{CK}. Since \\\\omega_1^{CK} is the first ordinal not representable in a computable system of ordinal notations the elements of \\\\mathcal{O} can be regarded as the canonical ordinal notations. Kleene (1938) described a system of notation for all recursive ordinals (those less than the Church‚ÄìKleene ordinal). It uses a subset of the natural numbers instead of finite strings of symbols. Unfortunately, there is in general no effective way to tell whether some natural number represents an ordinal, or whether two numbers represent the same ordinal. However, one can effectively find notations which represent the ordinal sum, product, and power (see ordinal arithmetic) of any two given notations in Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}; and given any notation for an ordinal, there is a recursively enumerable set of notations which contains one element for each smaller ordinal and is effectively ordered.  Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}  The basic idea of Kleene's system of ordinal notations is to build up ordinals in an effective manner. For members p of \\\\mathcal{O} , the ordinal for which p is a notation is p . \\\\mathcal{O} and <_\\\\mathcal{O} (a partial ordering of Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}) are the smallest sets such that the following holds. * The natural number 0 belongs to Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O} and 0 = 0 . * If i belongs to Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O} and |i= \\\\alpha , then 2^i belongs to Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O} and |2^i|= \\\\alpha + 1 and i <_\\\\mathcal{O} 2^i . * Suppose \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\\\\\} is the e -th partial recursive function. If e is total, with range contained in \\\\mathcal{O} , and for every natural number n , we have \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\\\\\} (n) <_{\\\\mathcal{O}} \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\\\\\} (n + 1) , then 3\\\\cdot 5^e belongs to Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}, \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\\\\\} (n) <_\\\\mathcal{O} 3\\\\cdot 5^e for each n and 3 \\\\cdot 5^e = \\\\lim_k |\\\\\\\\{e \\\\\\\\} (k) , i.e. 3 \\\\cdot 5^e is a notation for the limit of the ordinals \\\\gamma_k where \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\\\\\}(k)= \\\\gamma_k for every natural number k . * p <_\\\\mathcal{O} q and q <_\\\\mathcal{O} r imply p <_\\\\mathcal{O} r (this guarantees that <_\\\\mathcal{O} is transitive.) This definition has the advantages that one can recursively enumerate the predecessors of a given ordinal (though not in the <_\\\\mathcal{O} ordering) and that the notations are downward closed, i.e., if there is a notation for \\\\gamma and \\\\alpha < \\\\gamma then there is a notation for \\\\alpha .  Basic properties of <_\\\\mathcal{O}  * If |i= \\\\alpha and |j= \\\\beta and i <_{\\\\mathcal{O}} j \\\\,, then \\\\alpha < \\\\beta ; but the converse may fail to hold. * <_\\\\mathcal{O} induces a tree structure on \\\\mathcal{O} , so \\\\mathcal{O} is well-founded. * \\\\mathcal{O} only branches at limit ordinals; and at each notation of a limit ordinal, \\\\mathcal{O} is infinitely branching. * Since every recursive function has countably many indices, each infinite ordinal receives countably many notations; the finite ordinals have unique notations, n usually denoted n_\\\\mathcal{O} . * The first ordinal that doesn't receive a notation is called the Church‚ÄìKleene ordinal and is denoted by \\\\omega^{CK}_1. Since there are only countably many recursive functions, the ordinal \\\\omega^{CK}_1 is evidently countable. * The ordinals with a notation in Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O} are exactly the recursive ordinals. (The fact that every recursive ordinal has a notation follows from the closure of this system of ordinal notations under successor and effective limits.) * <_\\\\mathcal{O} is not recursively enumerable, but there is a recursively enumerable relation which agrees with <_\\\\mathcal{O} precisely on members of \\\\mathcal{O} . * For any notation p , the set \\\\lbrace q \\\\mid q <_{\\\\mathcal{O}} p \\\\rbrace of notations below p is recursively enumerable. However, Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}, when taken as a whole, is \\\\Pi^1_1 (see analytical hierarchy). * In fact, \\\\mathcal{O} is \\\\Pi^1_1-complete and every \\\\Sigma^1_1 subset of \\\\mathcal{O} is effectively bounded in \\\\mathcal{O} (a result of Spector). * \\\\mathcal{O} is the universal system of ordinal notations in the sense that any specific set of ordinal notations can be mapped into it in a straightforward way. More precisely, there is a recursive function f such that if e is an index for a recursive well-ordering, then f(e) is a member of \\\\mathcal{O} and <_e is order-isomorphic to an initial segment of the set \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\mid p <_\\\\mathcal{O} f(e) \\\\\\\\} . * There is a recursive function +_\\\\mathcal{O} , which, for members of \\\\mathcal{O} , mimics ordinal addition and has the property that \\\\max \\\\\\\\{ p,q \\\\\\\\} \\\\leq p +_\\\\mathcal{O} q . (Jockusch)  Properties of paths in \\\\mathcal{O}  A path in \\\\mathcal{O} is a subset \\\\mathcal{P} of \\\\mathcal{O} which is totally ordered by <_\\\\mathcal{O} and is closed under predecessors, i.e. if p is a member of a path \\\\mathcal{P} and q <_\\\\mathcal{O} p then q is also a member of \\\\mathcal{P} . A path \\\\mathcal{P} is maximal if there is no element of \\\\mathcal{O} which is above (in the sense of <_\\\\mathcal{O} ) every member of \\\\mathcal{P} , otherwise \\\\mathcal{P} is non-maximal. * A path \\\\mathcal{P} is non-maximal if and only if \\\\mathcal{P} is recursively enumerable (r.e.). It follows by remarks above that every element p of \\\\mathcal{O} determines a non-maximal path \\\\mathcal{P} ; and every non-maximal path is so determined. * There are 2^{\\\\aleph_0} maximal paths through \\\\mathcal{O} ; since they are maximal, they are non-r.e. * In fact, there are 2^{\\\\aleph_0} maximal paths within \\\\mathcal{O} of length \\\\omega^2 . (Crossley, Sch√ºtte) * For every non-zero ordinal \\\\lambda < \\\\omega_1^{CK} , there are 2^{\\\\aleph_0} maximal paths within \\\\mathcal{O} of length \\\\omega^2 \\\\cdot \\\\lambda . (Aczel) * Further, if \\\\mathcal{P} is a path whose length is not a multiple of \\\\omega^2 then \\\\mathcal{P} is not maximal. (Aczel) * For each r.e. degree d , there is a member e_d of \\\\mathcal{O} such that the path \\\\mathcal{P} = \\\\lbrace p \\\\mid p <_{\\\\mathcal{O}} e_d \\\\rbrace has many-one degree d . In fact, for each recursive ordinal \\\\alpha \\\\geq \\\\omega^2 , a notation e_d exists with |e_d= \\\\alpha . (Jockusch) * There exist \\\\aleph_0 paths through \\\\mathcal{O} which are \\\\Pi_1^1 .

As a General in the Missouri Militia, and ex-Attorney General of that state, Stringfellow openly defied the law by declaring that Missourians were free to vote in Kansas territory, and attacked abolitionist patrols in what became known as Bleeding Kansas. When the vote went against him, he turned his attention to developing the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Early life Stringfellow was the youngest of the ten children born to Robert Stringfellow (a veteran of the War of 1812 and merchant at Raccoon Ford on the Rapidan River and farmer in Culpeper County, Virginia), and Mary Plunkett (daughter of an early industrialist in Orange County, Virginia).Portrait and Biographical Record of Buchanan and Clinton Counties, Missouri (Chapman Bros, 1893) p. 171. at google books. Educated in Fredericksburg, Virginia, he then attended the University of Virginia and was admitted to practice law in Louisville, Kentucky in 1837. In 1839 Stringfellow moved to Boone's Lick, Missouri and practiced law in Keytesville, Missouri. He was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives as an anti-Benton Democrat serving from Chariton County, Missouri. Stringfellow served as Missouri's Attorney General from 1845 to 1849. Border ruffian In 1853 he and his doctor brother John moved to Weston, Missouri in Platte County just across the Missouri River from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. B.F Stringfellow practiced law with Peter T. Abell and published the pro-slavery Squatter Sovereign with his brother. In 1854 after four slaves from Platte County ran away to Leavenworth, they organized the Platte County Self-Defensive Association to attempt to prevent Free-Stater settlement of Kansas. The Stringfellow brothers also stumped western Missouri organizing \\"blue lodges\\" along the entire Kansas border. The brothers, working with David Rice Atchison, attempted to get residents of Southern states to move to Kansas with their slaves to counter settlements by the anti-slavery Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company. B.F. Stringfellow also issued \\"Stringfellow's Exposition,\\" which said Missourians could vote in Kansas as it decided whether to enter the Union as a free state or a slave state. Stringfellow's positions as General in the Missouri Militia increased his opinion's clout. The New York Tribune quoted him in an 1855 speech in St. Joseph, Missouri: :I tell you to mark every scoundrel that is in the least tainted with free-soilism or abolitionism and exterminate him. Neither give nor take quarter from the damned rascals. I propose to mark them in this house, and on the present occasion, so you may crush them out. To those who have qualms of conscience as to violating laws, state or national, the crisis has arrived when such impositions must be disregarded, as your rights and property are in danger, and I advise one and all to enter every election district in Kansas, in defiance of Reeder and his vile myrmidons, and vote at the point of the bowie-knife and the revolver. Neither give or take quarter, as our cause demands it. It is enough that the slaveholding interest wills it, from which there is no appeal. What right has Governor Reeder to rule Missourians in Kansas? His proclamation and prescribed oath must be prohibited. It is to your interest to do so. Mind that slavery is established where it is not prohibited.Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society by Kansas State Historical Society - 1908 (quote from New York Tribune on March 26, 1855 from a speech in St. Joseph, Missouri) Fight with Kansas Governor Andrew Reeder On July 2, 1855, he was accused of attacking Kansas Territory Governor Andrew Horatio Reeder at Reeder's office in the Shawnee Methodist Mission in Fairway, Kansas. The free state version of the encounter says: :Stringfellow sprang to his feet, seized his chair, and felled the Governor to the floor, kicking him when down. He also attempted to draw a revolver, but was prevented from using it by District Attorney Isaaks, and Mr. Halderman, the Governor's private secretary. And this the origin of the term, so common on the Kansas border for so many years, of \\"Border Ruffian\\" The slave state version said that Stringfellow told the governor: :I understand, sir, that you have publicly spoken and written of me in the East as a frontier ruffian, and I have called to ascertain whether you have done so...Then, sir, you uttered a falsehood, and I demand of you the satisfaction of a gentleman. I very much question your right to that privilege, for I do not believe you to be a gentleman; but nevertheless give you the opportunity to vindicate your title to that character, by allowing you to select such friends as you may please, and I will do the same, and we will step out here and settle the matter as gentlemen do...Then I will have to treat you as I would any other offensive animal. Bloodshed would occur on both sides of the Missouri-Kansas border in the Bleeding Kansas skirmishes as attempts were to influence how the state entered the union with 5,000 Missourians voting in one Kansas election alone. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad In 1859 after Kansas entered as a free state, Stringfellow moved to Atchison (named for his ally, political boss and future U.S. Senator David Rice Atchison), where he continued to practice law, although his brother John temporary returned to Virginia to settle their father's estate. The Stringfellow brothers organized the Atchison and St. Joseph Railroad Company and B.F. Stringfellow became company attorney.Portrait and Biographical Record of Buchanan and Clinton Counties, Missouri at p. 172 B.F. Stringfellow also performed legal work for the Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs Railroad, and the Kansas and Western Missouri Railway Company. During the Civil War, age prevented him from enlisting, and the Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy (which destroyed a crucial bridge on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad on September 3, 1861) and defeats of the Missouri State Guard may have changed his proslavery sympathies. B.F. Stringfellow continued his law practice through the war and concentrated on promoting the area's economic development. He worked with former antislavery adversary Cyrus K. Holliday, who had organized the Atchison and Topeka Railway Company in 1859, which reorganized in 1863 as the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Using their political connections and funds (government railroad bonds and land grants) allotted by the Pacific Railroad Acts, they connected their lines to the First Transcontinental Railroad at Council Bluffs in 1869. Three years later Topeka became the eastern terminus for the second transcontinental route, which ended in Los Angeles. B.F. Stringfellow died at the home of his daughter in Chicago, Illinois on April 26, 1891.

History In 1884 Thomas Parker built a practical production electric car in Wolverhampton using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. First introduced in 1889, battery vehicles milk floats expanded in 1931 and by 1967 gave Britain the largest electric vehicle fleet in the world. Terminology Hybrid electric vehicle use both electric motors and internal combustion engines, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicle whose batteries that can be charged externally are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their charge-depleting mode. PHEVs with a series powertrain are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the Chevrolet Volt and Fisker Karma. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), The electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (aka all-combustion vehicles) belong to one of the two categories.See definition on pp. 2.

Vehicles by type The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the higher oil prices and the advancement of new battery technology (Lithium Ion) that have higher power and energy density (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries). compared to older battery types such as lead-acid batteries. Lithium-ion batteries for example now have an energy density of 0.9‚Äì2.63 MJ/L whereas lead-acid batteries had an energy density of 0.36 MJ/L (so 2.5 to 7.3x higher). There is still a long way to go if comparing it to petroleum-based fuels and biofuels however (gasoline having an energy density of 34.2 MJ/L -38x to 12.92x higher- and ethanol having an energy of 24 MJ/L -26x to 9.12x higher-).

Comparison of alt= =Electric cars= A battery-powered electric car is an automobile which is propelled by electric motors. Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight. Electric cars can significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated. With the current US energy mix, using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.United States emission standards#Electricity generation Given the current energy mixes in other countries (that are transiting to more renewables), it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the UK, 19 percent in China, and as little as 1 percent in Germany....the four electric vehicles analysed in this study consume around 1.7 times less primary energy and generate less than half the CO2 of a Toyota Prius... Electric cars are having a major impact in the auto industry given advantages in city pollution, less dependence on oil and combustion, and scarcity and expected rise in gasoline prices. World governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components. The US has pledged in federal grants for electric cars and batteries.

Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Aut√≥dromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez.Electric vehicles for disabled people in alt=Electric vehicles for the disabled, in √Ördalstangen, Norway =Special-purpose vehicles= Special-purpose vehicles come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as golf carts, things like electric golf trolleys, milk floats, all-terrain vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered \\"in plant\\" work machines. Ather 450, an Indian electric scooter currently in production. =Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws= Three-wheeled vehicles include electric rickshaws, a powered variant of the cycle rickshaw. The large-scale adoption of electric two- wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of the existing urban infrastructure and safety regulations. Ather Energy from India has launched their BLDC motor powered Ather 450 electric scooter with Lithium Ion batteries in 2018. Also from India, AVERA \\\\- a new and renewable energy company is going to launch two models of electric scooters at the end of 2018, with Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery technology. =Electric bicycles= A person riding an electric bike in Tokyo. Pedelecs from the Call a Bike bicycle hire scheme in Berlin. China has experienced an explosive growth of sales of non-assisted e-bikes including scooter type, with annual sales jumping from 56,000 units in 1998 to over 21 million in 2008, and reaching an estimated 120 million e-bikes on the road in early 2010. China is the world's leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009. Some of the largest e-bike manufacturers of e-bikes in the world are BYD, Geoby. =Personal transporters= An increasing variety of personal transporters are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled self-balancing unicycles, self-balancing scooters, electric kick scooters, and electric skateboards. =Electric boats= Several battery electric ships operate throughout the world, some for business. Electric ferries are being operated and constructed. Technology =Motor controllers= The motor controller receives a signal from potentiometers linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed. This DC power is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles regenerative braking, whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics. =Battery pack= Most electric vehicles today use an electric battery, consisting of electrochemical cells with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle. Battery technology for EVs has developed from early lead-acid batteries used in the late 19th century to the 2010s, to lithium-ion batteries which are found in most EVs today. The overall battery is referred to as a battery pack, which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. For example, the Tesla Model S battery pack has up to 7,104 cells, split in 16 modules with 6 groups of 74 cells in each. Each cell has a nominal voltage of 3-4 volts, depending on its chemical composition. =Motors= Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of brushed DC electric motor. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of AC motor types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually induction motors or brushless AC electric motors which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the brushless DC electric motor. Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the drive shaft and ultimately the vehicle's wheels. Economy Video about the use of an electric vehicle in a smart grid. EV battery storage is a key-element for the global energy transition which is dependent on more electricity storage right now. As the energy availability is the most important factor for the vitality of an economy the mobile storage infrastructure of EV batteries can be seen as one of the most meaningful infrastructure projects facilitating the energy transition to a fully sustainably economy based on renewables. A meta study graphically showing the importance of electricity storage depicts the technology in context.  Environmental impact  =Power generation= Electric vehicles produce no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in operation, but the electricity used to power them may do so in its generation.https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner- Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf The two factors driving the emissions of battery electric vehicles are the carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh) and the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh). The carbon intensity of electricity varies depending on the source of electricity where it is consumed. A country with a high share of renewable energy in its electricity mix will have a low C.I. In the European Union, in 2013, the carbon intensity had a strong geographic variability but in most of the member states, electric vehicles were \\"greener\\" than conventional ones. On average, electric cars saved 50%‚Äì60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. Moreover, the de- carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of electric vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction in the electricity carbon intensity of 17%. In a life- cycle assessment perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower. = Vehicle construction = GHGs are also emitted when the electric vehicle is being manufactured. The lithium-ion batteries used in the vehicle take more materials and energy to produce because of the extraction process of the lithium and cobalt essential to the battery. This means the bigger the electric vehicle, the more carbon dioxide emitted. The mines that are used to produce the lithium and cobalt used in the battery are also creating problems for the environment, as fish are dying up to downstream from mining operations due to chemical leaks and the chemicals also leak into the water sources the people that live near the mines use, creating health problems for the animals and people that live nearby.

Etymology The Slovene name Veliki Stol, meaning 'great chair', is derived from the visual appearance of the mountain, especially when seen from the east. The German name Hochstuhl ('high chair'), was not introduced until the late 19th century. In previous times, the German designation was Stou, a phonetic derivation of the Slovene name. Geography The Stol massif stretches from ≈Ωirovnica in Slovenia to the Austrian market town of Feistritz im Rosental in the north. The summit is part of the Karawanks main ridge and the watershed between the Sava and Drava rivers. In the north, the Dachstein limestone rocks fall steeply to an over depth. The massif comprises several subpeaks, such as Mali Stol ('Little Chair'), at . In the east, the crest of the Karawanks leads to Mt. Vrtaƒça and further down to Loibl Pass. Ascent Pre≈°eren Lodge The first ascent of the mountain was made on 17 August 1794 by the Carniolan count and mountaineer Franz von Hohenwart (1771‚Äì1844) following an invitation from Sigmund Zois (1747‚Äì1819). On 9 September 1906 two climbers first reached the Stol peak via the steep north face. A first mountain hut south of the summit was erected by the Austrian Tourist Club in 1883 and called Valvasor Refuge. The Stou Refuge north of the main ridge was opened by the German and Austrian Alpine Club in 1886. Today there are numerous routes to the summit from Feistritz on the Austrian side via the Klagenfurt Lodge (Klagenfurter H√ºtte), built in 1906, as well as routes from ≈Ωirovnica in Slovenia, where the Pre≈°eren Lodge (Pre≈°ernova koƒça), opened in 1910, stands below the secondary peak of Mali Stol. Both refuges were burned down during World War II by Yugoslav partisans to prevent them from being used as base camps by Wehrmacht soldiers. The Klagenfurt Lodge re-opened in 1952 with 24 berths and a dormitory (Matratzenlager); the Pre≈°eren Lodge was rebuilt in 1966, it is nowadays open from mid-June to mid-September. It has 45 berths, a washroom, and two dining rooms with a seating capacity of 80.Slovenian Tourist Board The ascent of the 500 m steep slope on the north face of the mountain is climbed by a via ferrata (Klettersteig) built by the Austrian Alpine Club in 1966/67, the use of which requires some mountaineering skills.

Landis was born in Hanford, California; he was listed as tall and . Landis signed with the Athletics in 1961 and appeared in one game for them two years later, a late-season relief assignment against the Cleveland Indians. In the minor leagues, he was known for his wildness, issuing over 100 bases on balls during three of his first four seasons as a professional. The Red Sox selected him in the 1966 Rule 5 Draft and he pitched for them for the next three full MLB seasons. During his rookie campaign, the 1967 \\"Impossible Dream\\" Red Sox unexpectedly won the American League pennant. Still struggling with his control, Landis worked in only 18 games that year and missed the 1967 World Series due to U.S. Army Reserve commitments.Nowlin, Bill, \\"Bill Landis.\\" Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project In , Landis enjoyed his finest season in the majors. Working in 38 games, 37 in relief, he compiled a strong 3.15 earned run average and a career-high three saves. He also struck out twice as many hitters (59) as he walked (30). In 1969, Landis was used more frequently, setting career bests in appearances (45) and innings pitched (82), but he was plagued by a sore arm and his effectiveness diminished. Boston shipped him to Triple-A Louisville in 1970, and Landis left baseball after a brief Triple-A trial in 1971 with the St. Louis Cardinals. For his MLB career, Landis posted a 9‚Äì8 record with a 4.46 ERA in 102 appearances. In six starts, he failed to register a complete game. He was credited with four saves. In 169 innings pitched, he allowed 154 hits and 91 bases on balls, with 135 strikeouts.

Based on a play by Bjarne Reuter, Buster's verden deals with the experiences of young Buster Oregon Mortensen. The television series was a break-through for director Bille August, and the soundtrack also provided a hit for the young singer Nanna L√ºders Jensen. Background The television series was based on a play by Danish author Bjarne Reuter. In 1984 Reuter published his collection Tre skuespil (\\"Three Plays\\"); a collection containing also En dag i Hector Hansens liv (\\"A Day in the Life of Hector Hansen\\") and Kom der lys i neonr√∏ret, gutter? (\\"Was There Light in the Neon Tube, Boys?\\") - in addition to Busters Verden. Director Bille August had already worked with Reuter, on the 1983 movie Zappa where August's script was based on a book by Reuter. August was still a relatively unknown director outside Denmark at the time, but the success he had with Buster helped pave the way for his international break-through with the Oscar-winning Pelle the Conqueror in 1989. Television series The protagonist of the series is Buster Oregon Mortensen, played by Mads Bugge Andersen. Buster's father (Peter Schr√∏der) is an unemployed magician, from whom Buster learns to perform magic tricks. Buster also has a younger sister called Ingeborg (Katarina Stenbeck), who has a disability referred to as a \\"stiff leg\\". Both Buster and his sister are frequently bullied by other kids in school, but he maintains a positive outlook on life, and is confirmed in his optimism when he meets and falls in love with the piano child prodigy Joanna (Signe Dahl Madsen). The series consisted of six episodes of twenty minutes each, that aired between 7 January and 11 February 1984: *Episode 1: The school Buster attends is celebrating the 25-year anniversary for the principal. Buster is meant to do a magic trick for entertainment, but ends up spoiling the party. *Episode 2: Ingeborg is being bullied by Store-Lars (Big Lars), and Buster interferes for his sister. *Episode 3: While distributing milk on his bike, Buster meets the young piano prodigy Joanna, and falls in love. *Episode 4: Ingeborg, as a girl scout, is organising a party in the vicar's garden, and Buster helps. *Episode 5: Buster is not doing well in school and the teachers believe that magic takes up too much of his time. *Episode 6: Johanna invites Buster to perform at her party, but the snobbish guests were expecting Johanna's piano playing, not Buster's magic tricks. Film The movie was an edited version of the television series, and premiered on 4 October 1984. The content had to be cut down, from the original 120 minutes to one and a half hours. The critics were still happy with the result, however, as many felt the movie format gave the viewer a better opportunity to acquaint themselves with the characters. At the 1984 Berlin International Film Festival, the film won both the C.I.F.E.J. Award (Centre International du Film pour l'Enfance et la Jeuneusse) and the UNICEF Award. Music The twenty-year-old, and still relatively unknown singer Nanna L√ºders Jensen was asked by August to provide a song for the television series. Nanna's song, titled simply \\"Buster\\" became an instant hit in Denmark, and launched her to national fame. The song can also be found on her album, \\"Sm√• Bl√• Breve\\" Controversy Actor Mads Bugge Andersen is not happy with this movie and all the attention it gave. He believes in general that there is too little focus on the negative side of being a child star.

Designed for speeds of and compatibility with neighbouring countries' rail systems, it connects the cities of Madrid and Barcelona in 2 hours 30 minutes. In Barcelona the line is connected with the Perpignan‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line leading into France which connects it to the European high speed network.  First stages  In 2003 construction of the first phase of a new standard gauge line from Madrid to the French border (Madrid‚ÄìZaragoza‚ÄìLleida) was completed and on 11 October of that year commercial service began. This service also stopped at Guadalajara‚ÄìYebes and Calatayud. The service began running at only . On 19 May 2006, after two years of operation, speed was increased to when the Spanish ASFA signalling system was replaced with level 1 of the new European ETCS/ERTMS system. On 16 October 2006 the trains on this line increased their operating speed to . On 18 December 2006 the AVE started operating to Camp de Tarragona, and on 7 May 2007 the service increased its speed to the maximum allowable for the line, . This puts Tarragona at 30 minutes from Lleida. The extension to Barcelona was delayed various times due to technical problems; the Ministerio de Fomento having originally forecast the AVE's arrival in Barcelona by the end of 2007.  Complete operation  The complete line was opened February 2008. As of 2012, seventeen trains now run every day between the hours of 6 am and 9 pm, covering the distance between the two cities in just 2 hours 30 minutes for the direct trains, and in 3 hours and 10 minutes for those calling at all intermediate stations. Before the high-speed line was built, the journey between the two cities took more than six hours; and when the high speed line went only as far as Tarragona, 3 hours 45 minutes, operated with the Alvia service (120 series train), which continued on the conventional line to Barcelona, after a change of rail gauge.  Speed  It was originally forecast that, after reaching Barcelona in 2004, the line would run at , the maximum capable speed of the new Siemens AVE trains which have replaced the Talgo Bombardier AVE S102, after the installation of level 2 of the ETCS/ERTMS. But on the AVE's first day of operating at to Tarragona the Minister of Public Works, Magdalena √Ålvarez, stated that the maximum commercial operating speeds of the AVE on all lines would be .La Vanguardia, 7 May 2007 Nevertheless, in October 2011 the speed was raised to 310 km/h on parts of the railway.Madrid - Barcelona at 310 km/h with ETCS Level 2  Usage  It was forecast that the AVE would substantially replace air traffic on the Barcelona - Madrid route (in the same way that the Eurostar has on the London- Paris/London-Brussels routes and France's TGV has on the Paris-Lyon route). Indeed, by the end of 2017, the line had already taken 63% of the traffic, stealing most of it from aircraft.Barcelona-Madrid high-speed line has had more than 85 million passengers 21 February 2018 A few years before the Madrid-Barcelona route was the world's busiest passenger air route in 2007 with 971 scheduled flights per week (both directions).Air passenger transport in Europe in 2007 Similarly more than 80% of travellers between Madrid and Seville use the AVE, with fewer than 20% travelling by air.Juan Carlos Mart√≠n and Gustavo Nombela, \\"Microeconomic impacts of investments in high speed trains in Spain\\", Annals of Regional Science, vol. 41, no. 3, September 2007  Criticism  There was criticism during the construction of the Madrid- Barcelona line. A critical report by the consulting firm KPMG, commissioned by ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias) at the behest of the Ministry for Public Works (') on 23 June 2004, pointed to a lack of in-depth studies and over-hasty execution of works as the most important reasons for the problems that dogged construction of the AVE line. For example, during the construction of the AVE tunnel near Barcelona, a number of nearby buildings suffered damage from a sinkhole that appeared near a commuter rail station, damaging one of its platforms. The construction committee of Barcelona's famed Sagrada Familia church lobbied for a re-routing of the tunnel - it passes within metres of the massive church's foundations. It also passes equally near the UNESCO-recognized Casa Mil√† also designed by Antoni Gaud√≠. Furthermore, until 2005 both Siemens and Talgo/Bombardier train sets failed to meet scheduled speed targets, although in a test run during the homologation tests of the new S102 trains of RENFE, a train-set Talgo 350 (AVE S-102) reached a speed of on the night of the 25/26 June 2006, and in July 2006 a Siemens Velaro train-set (AVE S-103) reached the highest top speed ever in Spain: . At this time, it was a record for railed vehicles in Spain and a world record for unmodified commercial service trainsets, as the earlier TGV and ICE records were achieved with specially modified and shortened trainsets, and the 1996 Shinkansen record of was using a test (non-commercial) trainset. Planned services in 2012 At Paracuellos de la Ribera Overview map of the high-speed connections from Barcelona towards France, with the year of opening  Extension to France  = Barcelona to Figueres = Originally planned to open in 2009, the extension of some Madrid-Barcelona routes to Figueres‚ÄìVilafant railway station via Girona, opened on 7 January 2013. This made possible upon the completion of the Barcelona-Figueres section of the Perpignan‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line that connected for first time the Spanish AVE high-speed network with the French TGV high-speed network. There have been delays in building a four kilometre tunnel in Girona, the first phase of which was finished in September 2010, and controversy over the route between Sants and Sagrera stations in Barcelona. there are eight trains a day running from Madrid, connecting at Figueres Vilafant with two TGV services to Paris. = Figueres to Perpignan = This is an international high speed rail section between France and Spain. The section connects two cities on opposite sides of the border, Perpignan in Roussillon, France, and Figueres in Catalonia, Spain. It consists of a railway which crosses the French‚ÄìSpanish border via the Perthus Tunnel, an tunnel bored under the Perthus Pass. The section is open to high speed trains and freight. Construction was completed in February 2009, although services did not run until a station was built on the line at Figueres. As of March 2015, a daily TGV service connects Paris to Barcelona Sants via Perpignan-Figueres with 2 pairs of trips, plus other connections involving Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse.

In recent years, there have been a number of such memoirs published by major publishers, some that were well received critically and became best sellers, even though subsequently proven to be partially or completely fabricated. A number of recent fake memoirs fall into the category of \\"misery lit,\\" where the authors claim to have overcome bereavement, abuse, addiction, poverty and other overwhelming losses. Several more have detailed fabricated stories of Holocaust survival, with at least one having been penned by an actual Holocaust victim. As a result of the recent series of best selling memoirs having been outed for falsification, there have been calls for stronger vetting and fact checking of an author's material.\\"Lies and Consequences: Tracking the Fallout of (Another) Literary Fraud\\", The New York Times, 2008-03-05, p.

Public reception A number of fake memoirs in recent years have been published by renowned publishing houses and received critical acclaim only to be exposed as partial or complete fabrications. Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood (Binjamin Wilkomirski), The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams (Nasdijj), Love and Consequences (Margaret Seltzer), and Go Ask Alice (Anonymous) garnered praise from The New York Times before it was exposed as false. Love and Consequences (Margaret Seltzer) and Odd Man Out (Matt McCarthy) were published by Penguin Group USA. A Million Little Pieces was published by Random House. Two authors of recent fake memoirs, James Frey (A Million Little Pieces), and Herman Rosenblat (who was featured before he wrote Angel at the Fence), as well as an imposter assuming the name Anthony Godby Johnson (A Rock and a Hard Place), appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. All eventually had their mendacity made public, and the scheduled publication of Rosenblat's book was cancelled. Frey, accompanied by his editor Nan Talese, was confronted by Oprah during a follow-up episode. The controversy over falsified memoirs inspired Andrea Troy to pen her satiric novel, Daddy ‚Äì An Absolutely Authentic Fake Memoir (2008). There is also the case of people who build up a public profile as a survivor of a disastrous event, with the intention of drawing attention and profiting from it. Some of these have achieved publishing deals with major publishers; for example, Belle Gibson had lucrative deals with Penguin and Simon & Schuster, before her story of self-cure from cancer was shown to be false.

The river is downstream from the Dolgoch Falls which is a popular nature site, and is followed for much of its course by the Talyllyn Railway.  Name  The name of the river in Welsh is Mathew, presumably in origin the personal name Matthew. Due to the rule of consonant mutation, Mathew becomes Fathew following the feminine noun afon ('river'). Likewise, the feminine noun pont ('bridge') gives rise to the name of the hamlet Pontfathew, now considered to be a part of the village of Bryn-crug. In English, the Welsh name Afon Fathew is commonly used, and River Mathew less so. The form River Fathew is also quite common, although it is difficult to justify on a linguistic basis.  Course  The Afon Fathew is a short river and flows in a southwesterly direction from near Dolgoch railway station, joining the River Dysynni to the east of Tywyn near Bryncrug. The Talyllyn Railway runs beside the Afon Fathew for much of its course. The Dolgoch Falls are a series of three waterfalls on the Nant Dol-g√¥ch stream, which is a tributary of the Afon Fathew, and are a popular destination for walkers from Dolgoch station. The river valley is interesting geologically because it exhibits river capture. Above Dolgoch, the valley is occupied by the River Dysynni. During a glacial period, the valley was blocked by a major landslide at Abergynolwyn, the scar from which can still be seen on the side of the valley. The River Dysynni was thus forced to adopt a new course, and pushed its way through the hills northwestwards to find a new channel in the parallel valley to the north. The River Fathew is made up of the lower tributaries of the former Dysynni which continue to flow down a valley which is disproportionately large relative to the volume of water that flows through it.

Origins and Responsibilities Founded in 1968http://www.glias.org.uk/index.htm by individuals who had been involved in the Thames Valley Observation Group, it quickly established itself as the leading industrial archaeological and industrial history group in the London Area. It is a member of the South East Regional Industrial Archaeological Conference, the Association for Industrial Archaeology, and the TICCIH. It also works together with more locally directed history groups and projects supporting individual conservation projects, as well as raising industrial historical issues with national UK organisations such as English Heritage and the Royal Fine Art Commission. In addition it comments on planning applications and developments likely to have an effect on the survival of industrial structures. In this remit it acts as a statutory consultee. Its membership is crossed with many other similar organisations and bodies that have similar objectives such as the King's Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee, the Newcomen Society and the Association for Industrial Archaeology.  Activities  Every year it organises a series of half-a-dozen lectures (held in Central London) on industrial archaeology. It provides a bi- monthly newsletter, which is still produced as hard copy in an A4 Gestetner form. It also hosts a series of popular walks around sites of industrial archaeological importance in London, often hosted by people who are expert about the matters in question. An occasional journal is produced.  Database  In the early 1990s AIA developed a national standardised method for collecting industrial archaeology data. The result was the IRIS (Index Record for Industrial Sites) booklet and forms, published in 1993. In 1998, GLIAS began to develop a database which could used to record site information in London. The intention was to make the database compatible with the IRIS data standard, and the first version was essentially an electronic IRIS form. An early version was demonstrated to a special committee of the society, the Recording Group and this was later presented to the AIA. This was favourably received and the database has been in development ever since. In 2002 the society received an award from them.

Cancer vaccines Cancer is a group of fatal diseases that involves abnormal cell growth that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. They are usually caused by the accumulation of mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Majority of cancer, about 90-95%, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors ‚Äì including age, chemicals, diet, exercise, viruses, and radiation. The remaining 5-10% are due to inherited genetics. Some of the cancers may be difficult to treat by conventional means such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but may be controlled by the stimulation of the immune response of the body with the help of cancer vaccines. # Preventive or prophylactic vaccines # Treatment or therapeutic vaccines These vaccines are intended to treat existing cancer by stimulating the patient‚Äôs immune system. Cancer vaccines can also divided into specific or universal cancer vaccine based on the types of cancer it is used for. Specific cancer vaccines are only used to treat a particular type of cancer while universal vaccine can be used to treat different types of cancer. =Protein/peptide-based vaccines= *Tumor-associated antigens Vaccines of this kind use specific tumor antigens, which are usually proteins or peptides, to stimulate immune system against either tumor specific antigens (TSAs) or tumor associated antigens (TAAs).

Consequently, the evaluation of a tumor proliferative index (or growth fraction) has clinical significance in characterizing many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This has led investigators to develop different technologies to evaluate the proliferation index in tumor samples. The most commonly used methods in evaluating a proliferative index include mitotic indexing, thymidine-labeling index, bromodeoxyuridine assay, the determination of fraction of cells in various phases of cell cycle, and the immunohistochemical evaluation of cell cycle- associated proteins.  Mitotic index  Mitoses in a neuroendocrine tumor. Mitotic indexing is the oldest method of assessing proliferation and is determined by counting the number of mitotic figures (cells undergoing mitosis) through a light microscope on H&E; stained sections. It is usually expressed as the number of cells per microscopic field. Cells in the mitotic phase are identified by the typical appearance of their chromosomes in the cell during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Usually the number of mitotic figures is expressed as the total number in a defined number of high power fields, such as 10 mitoses in 10 high power fields. Since the field of vision area can vary considerably between different microscopes, the exact area of the high power fields should be defined in order to compare results from different studies. Accordingly, one of the main problems of counting mitosis has been the reproducibility. Thus, the need for standardized methodology and strict protocols is important to achieve reproducible results.  Thymidine- labeling index  Thymidine-labeling indexing is determined by counting the number of tumor nuclei labeled on autoradiographed sections after incubating the tumor cells with thymidine. Rapidly proliferating cells readily update more radiolabeled Thymidine, which produces darker spots on the autoradiograph film.  Bromodeoxyuridine assay  A bromodeoxyuridine assay, similar to thymidine-labeling indexing, incubates cells with radiolabeled bromodeoxyuridine, which is taken up at a greater rate by proliferating cells, and then uses a film to image the distribution of radiolabeled bromodeoxyuridine in cells.  S-phase fraction evaluation  Evaluating DNA histograms through flow cytometry provides an estimate of the fractions of cells within each of the phases in the cell cycle. Cell nuclei are stained with a DNA binding stain and the amount of staining is measured from the histogram. The fractions of cells within the different cell cycle phases (G0/G1, S and G2/M compartments) can then be calculated from the histogram by computerized cell cycle analysis.  Immunohistochemical evaluation  The immunohistochemical detection of proliferation related proteins such as Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen is a commonly used method to determine the proliferation index. Ki-67 is a nuclear antigen expressed in proliferating cells that is coded by the MKI67 gene on chromosome 10, and is expressed during the GI, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. Cells are then stained with a Ki-67 antibody, and the number of stained nuclei is then expressed as a percentage of total tumor cells. It is recommended to count at least 500 tumor cells in the highest labeled area. The Ki-67 score closely correlates with other proliferation markers, and has been shown to have prognostic and predictive value for many different tumor types. Similarly, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a protein associated with cell proliferation that is upregulated in proliferating cells, making it another useful antigen for immunostaining. It is associated with DNA polymerase alpha, which is expressed throughout the phases of the cell cycle. The expression of PCNA also correlates well with other proliferation markers such as mitotic count, S-phase fraction and Ki-67 staining.  Diagnostic role of proliferation index  The various methods of characterizing the proliferation index have found roles in both the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of tumors. For instances, the number of mitotic cells is used to classify tumors. In general, a high proliferation index suggests malignancy and high-grade tumors. Among solid tumors, the clinical significance of the proliferation index on breast cancer has been extensively studied. Mitotic counting has also been shown in multiple studies to have prognostic value in breast cancer, where a lower count of mitotic cells correlates with a more favorable outcome, and thus has been incorporated into part of the histological grading system. The Ki-67 labelling index has also been found to have prognostic significance where in many clinical practice guidelines, evaluation of Ki-67 in newly diagnosed invasive breast carcinomas is recommended. Additionally, the tumor proliferation index has been used to predict the response to systemic chemotherapies in patients who are receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy where patients who have tumors with high tumor proliferative index respond better to systemic cytotoxic therapies than those who have tumors with a low tumor proliferative index.

A prospective cohort study is a longitudinal cohort study that follows over time a group of similar individuals (cohorts) who differ with respect to certain factors under study, to determine how these factors affect rates of a certain outcome. For example, one might follow a cohort of middle-aged truck drivers who vary in terms of smoking habits, to test the hypothesis that the 20-year incidence rate of lung cancer will be highest among heavy smokers, followed by moderate smokers, and then nonsmokers. The prospective study is important for research on the etiology of diseases and disorders. The distinguishing feature of a prospective cohort study is that at the time that the investigators begin enrolling subjects and collecting baseline exposure information, none of the subjects have developed any of the outcomes of interest. After baseline information is collected, subjects in a prospective cohort study are then followed \\"longitudinally,\\" i.e. over a period of time, usually for years, to determine if and when they become diseased and whether their exposure status changes outcomes. In this way, investigators can eventually use the data to answer many questions about the associations between \\"risk factors\\" and disease outcomes. For example, one could identify smokers and non-smokers at baseline and compare their subsequent incidence of developing heart disease. Alternatively, one could group subjects based on their body mass index (BMI) and compare their risk of developing heart disease or cancer. Prospective cohort studies are typically ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence than retrospective cohort studies.http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowFulltext&ArtikelNr;=235241&ProduktNr;=228539 and can be more expensive than a case‚Äìcontrol study.

Historical development  After the foundation of the German Hanseatic League in the late Middle Ages, so-called regulated messenger hauls were formed, which were used to transport messages from Hamburg via L√ºbeck, Rostock, Stettin, Danzig, and K√∂nigsberg to Riga, as well as via Bremen to Amsterdam and via Celle and Braunschweig to Nuremberg. In 1649, a Danish post office opened in Hamburg. In the 17th century, the Thurn und Taxis post settled down in Hamburg; the post and goods carriage, with royal privileges, was established between Hamburg and Nuremberg. In 1810, Napoleon annexed the three Hanseatic cities and the northwest of Germany in the course of the Continental System against Great Britain. After the end of the French occupation, several post offices were re-established in Hamburg. The Hanseatic city had its own post offices in Hamburg and Ritzeb√ºttel. In the Hamburg city post office (Mengstra√üe No. 43), the Swedish-Norwegian post, the post of Thurn and Taxis (Mengstra√üe No. 48), and the post of Hannover were housed. The Prussian Central Post Office, the Mecklenburg Post, and the Danish Post worked in their own buildings. A register was available where one could look up where to hand over his post for different destinations. The post to England and overseas was delivered by the city post. The Thurn und Taxis post was in charge of the post to France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland. Prussia delivered the post to Russia and Poland, as well as to Turkey via Austria. Scandinavia was supplied by the Danish or the Swedish- Norwegian post. Starting in 1796, the post to Heligoland, which belonged to Denmark at that time, was delivered by a Hamburg postal agent, as there was a Hamburg postal agency on Heligoland. On 1 January 1852, Hamburg joined the German-Austrian Postal Union. Since 1866, Hamburg was part of the North German Confederation, which took over the postal service in the North German Postal District on 1 January 1868.  Stamps  Stamps of the Hamburg City Post = Postage stamps of the Hamburg City Post = The first postage stamps of the Hamburg City Post Office were introduced on 1 January 1859. They were rectangular and in the middle was the coat of arms of the city, overlaid with the value number. Below that is the word Postmarke (postage stamp), above it is Hamburg. Value and currency (Schilling) are imprinted as text at the borders. Values of ¬Ω, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 Schillinge were issued. In 1864, the supplemental values 1.25 and 2.5 Schillinge with a different frame design were issued. These early issues were already gummed but still imperforated. The following nine values, issued in 1864 and 1867 and again with the design of the first issues, finally had perforations. In 1866, another two values with a different octagonal frame design were issued; and on 5 May 1867, another one with the design of the first stamps. Hamburg's stamps were only valid until the end of 1867, since as of 1 January 1868, only the stamps of the North German Postal District were valid. = Stamps of the Institute of Hamburg's Messengers = The Institute of Hamburg's Messengers issued a stamp with the value of ¬Ω Schilling. The private company delivered only letters and newspapers within the city of Hamburg and charged half a Schilling. The stamps were printed in black on coloured paper.

Two or more such determinations at different locations then specify the shape of the reference ellipsoid which best approximates the shape of the geoid. This process is called the determination of the figure of the Earth. The earliest determinations of the size of a spherical Earth required a single arc. The latest determinations use astro-geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to determine the reference ellipsoids. Those interested in accurate expressions of the meridian arc for the WGS84 ellipsoid should consult the subsection entitled numerical expressions. History of measurement =Spherical Earth= Early estimations of Earth's size are recorded from Greece in the 4th century BC, and from scholars at the caliph's House of Wisdom in the 9th century. The first realistic value was calculated by Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes about 240 BC. He estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 stadia, with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres). Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled On the measure of the Earth, which has not been preserved. A similar method was used by Posidonius about 150 years later, and slightly better results were calculated in 827 by the grade measurement of the Caliph Al-Ma'mun. =Ellipsoidal Earth= Early literature uses the term oblate spheroid to describe a sphere \\"squashed at the poles\\". Modern literature uses the term ellipsoid of revolution in place of spheroid, although the qualifying words \\"of revolution\\" are usually dropped. An ellipsoid that is not an ellipsoid of revolution is called a triaxial ellipsoid. Spheroid and ellipsoid are used interchangeably in this article, with oblate implied if not stated. 17th and 18th centuries Although it had been known since classical antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century, evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere. In 1672, Jean Richer found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a pendulum clock to Cayenne, French Guiana and found that it lost minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris. This indicated the acceleration of gravity was less at Cayenne than at Paris. Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the geographical poles than at the Equator. In 1687, Newton had published in the Principia as a proof that the Earth was an oblate spheroid of flattening equal to .Isaac Newton: Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III, translated into English by Andrew Motte. A searchable modern translation is available at 17centurymaths. Search the following pdf file for 'spheroid'. This was disputed by some, but not all, French scientists. A meridian arc of Jean Picard was extended to a longer arc by Giovanni Domenico Cassini and his son Jacques Cassini over the period 1684‚Äì1718.. Freely available online at Archive.org and Forgotten Books (). In addition the book has been reprinted by Nabu Press (), the first chapter covers the history of early surveys. The arc was measured with at least three latitude determinations, so they were able to deduce mean curvatures for the northern and southern halves of the arc, allowing a determination of the overall shape. The results indicated that the Earth was a prolate spheroid (with an equatorial radius less than the polar radius). To resolve the issue, the French Academy of Sciences (1735) proposed expeditions to Peru (Bouguer, Louis Godin, de La Condamine, Antonio de Ulloa, Jorge Juan) and Lapland (Maupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, Le Monnier, Abbe Outhier, Anders Celsius). The expedition to Peru is described in the French Geodesic Mission article and that to Lapland is described in the Torne Valley article. The resulting measurements at equatorial and polar latitudes confirmed that the Earth was best modelled by an oblate spheroid, supporting Newton. By 1743, Clairaut's theorem however had completely supplanted Newton's approach. By the end of the century, Delambre had remeasured and extended the French arc from Dunkirk to the Mediterranean (the meridian arc of Delambre and M√©chain). It was divided into five parts by four intermediate determinations of latitude. By combining the measurements together with those for the arc of Peru, ellipsoid shape parameters were determined and the distance between the Equator and pole along the Paris Meridian was calculated as toises as specified by the standard toise bar in Paris. Defining this distance as exactly led to the construction of a new standard metre bar as toises. 19th century In the 19th century, many astronomers and geodesists were engaged in detailed studies of the Earth's curvature along different meridian arcs. The analyses resulted in a great many model ellipsoids such as Plessis 1817, Airy 1830, Bessel 1830, Everest 1830, and Clarke 1866. A comprehensive list of ellipsoids is given under Earth ellipsoid. Calculation The determination of the meridian distance, that is the distance from the equator to a point at a latitude on the ellipsoid is an important problem in the theory of map projections, particularly the transverse Mercator projection. Ellipsoids are normally specified in terms of the parameters defined above, , , , but in theoretical work it is useful to define extra parameters, particularly the eccentricity, , and the third flattening . Only two of these parameters are independent and there are many relations between them: :\\\\begin{align} f&=\\\\frac{a-b}{a}\\\\,, \\\\qquad e^2=f(2-f)\\\\,, \\\\qquad n=\\\\frac{a-b}{a+b}=\\\\frac{f}{2-f}\\\\,,\\\\\\\\\\\\ b&=a(1-f)=a\\\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\\\,,\\\\qquad e^2=\\\\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} The meridian radius of curvature can be shownRapp, R, (1991): Geometric Geodesy, Part I, ¬ß3.5.1, pp. 28‚Äì32. to be equal to : M(\\\\varphi) = \\\\frac{a(1 - e^2)}{\\\\left(1 - e^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi \\\\right)^\\\\frac32}, so that the arc length of an infinitesimal element of the meridian is (with in radians). Therefore, the meridian distance from the equator to latitude is :\\\\begin{align} m(\\\\varphi) &=\\\\int_0^\\\\varphi M(\\\\varphi) \\\\, d\\\\varphi \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a(1 - e^2)\\\\int_0^\\\\varphi \\\\left(1 - e^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac32} \\\\, d\\\\varphi\\\\,. \\\\end{align} The distance formula is simpler when written in terms of the parametric latitude, :m(\\\\varphi) = b\\\\int_0^\\\\beta\\\\sqrt{1 + e'^2\\\\sin^2\\\\beta}\\\\,d\\\\beta\\\\,, where and . The distance from the equator to the pole, the quarter meridian, is :m_\\\\mathrm{p} = m\\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\pi 2\\\\right)\\\\,. Even though latitude is normally confined to the range , all the formulae given here apply to measuring distance around the complete meridian ellipse (including the anti-meridian). Thus the ranges of , , and the rectifying latitude , are unrestricted. =Relation to elliptic integrals= The above integral is related to a special case of an incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind. In the notation of the online NIST handbookF. W. J. Olver, D. W. Lozier, R. F. Boisvert, and C. W. Clark, editors, 2010, NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Cambridge University Press). (Section 19.2(ii)), :m(\\\\varphi)=a\\\\left(1-e^2\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\Pi(\\\\varphi,e^2,e)\\\\,. It may also be written in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind (See the NIST handbook Section 19.6(iv)), :\\\\begin{align} m(\\\\varphi) &= a\\\\left(E(\\\\varphi,e)-\\\\frac{e^2\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\varphi}{\\\\sqrt{1-e^2\\\\sin^2\\\\varphi}}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a\\\\left(E(\\\\varphi,e)+\\\\frac{d^2}{d\\\\varphi^2}E(\\\\varphi,e)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= b E(\\\\beta, ie')\\\\,. \\\\end{align} The quarter meridian can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, :m_\\\\mathrm{p}=aE(e)=bE(ie'). The calculation (to arbitrary precision) of the elliptic integrals and approximations are also discussed in the NIST handbook. These functions are also implemented in computer algebra programs such as MathematicaMathematica guide: Elliptic Integrals and Maxima.Maxima, 2009, A computer algebra system, version 5.20.1. =Series expansions= The above integral may be expressed as an infinite truncated series by expanding the integrand in a Taylor series, performing the resulting integrals term by term, and expressing the result as a trigonometric series. In 1755, Euler derived an expansion in the third eccentricity squared. Expansions in the eccentricity () Delambre in 1799Delambre, J. B. J.

In this article, trigonometric terms of the form are interpreted as . Expansions in the third flattening () Series with considerably faster convergence can be obtained by expanding in terms of the third flattening instead of the eccentricity. They are related by :e^2 = \\\\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}\\\\,. In 1837, Bessel obtained one such series, which was put into a simpler form by Helmert,Helmert, F. R. (1880): Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der h√∂heren Geod√§sie, Einleitung und 1 Teil, Druck und Verlag von B. G. Teubner, Leipzig, ¬ß 1.7, pp. 44‚Äì48.

Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, New Series 52, page 12 :m(\\\\varphi)=\\\\frac{a+b}2\\\\left(H_0\\\\varphi+H_2\\\\sin 2\\\\varphi+H_4\\\\sin4\\\\varphi+H_6\\\\sin6\\\\varphi+H_8\\\\sin8\\\\varphi+\\\\cdots\\\\right)\\\\,, with :\\\\begin{align} H_0 &= 1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{4} n^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \\\\cdots, \\\\\\\\\\\\ H_2 &= - \\\\tfrac{3}{2} n + \\\\tfrac{3}{16} n^3 + \\\\cdots,& H_6 &= - \\\\tfrac{35}{48} n^3 + \\\\cdots, \\\\\\\\\\\\ H_4 &= \\\\tfrac{15}{16} n^2 - \\\\tfrac{15}{64} n^4 - \\\\cdots,\\\\qquad& H_8 &= \\\\tfrac{315}{512} n^4 - \\\\cdots. \\\\end{align} Because changes sign when and are interchanged, and because the initial factor is constant under this interchange, half the terms in the expansions of vanish. The series can be expressed with either or as the initial factor by writing, for example, :\\\\frac12(a+b) = \\\\frac{a}{1+n} = a(1-n+n^2-n^3+n^4-\\\\cdots)\\\\,, and expanding the result as a series in . Even though this results in more slowly converging series, such series are used in the specification for the transverse Mercator projection by the National Geospatial Intelligence AgencyJ. W. Hager, J.F. Behensky, and B.W. Drew, 1989. Defense Mapping Agency Technical Report TM 8358.2. The universal grids: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) and the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain.A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain, Ordnance Survey of Great Britain. Series in terms of the parametric latitude In 1825, Bessel derived an expansion of the meridian distance in terms of the parametric latitude in connection with his work on geodesics, :m(\\\\varphi)=\\\\frac{a+b}2\\\\left(B_0\\\\beta+B_2\\\\sin 2\\\\beta+B_4\\\\sin4\\\\beta+B_6\\\\sin6\\\\beta+B_8\\\\sin8\\\\beta+\\\\cdots\\\\right)\\\\,, with :\\\\begin{align} B_0 &= 1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{4} n^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \\\\cdots = H_0\\\\,,\\\\\\\\\\\\ B_2 &= - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} n + \\\\tfrac{1}{16} n^3 + \\\\cdots, & B_6 &= - \\\\tfrac{1}{48} n^3 + \\\\cdots, \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_4 &= - \\\\tfrac{1}{16} n^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \\\\cdots, \\\\qquad& B_8 &= - \\\\tfrac{5}{512} n^4 + \\\\cdots. \\\\end{align} Because this series provides an expansion for the elliptic integral of the second kind, it can be used to write the arc length in terms of the geographic latitude as :m(\\\\varphi)=\\\\frac{a+b}2\\\\left(B_0\\\\varphi- B_2\\\\sin2\\\\varphi+B_4\\\\sin4\\\\varphi- B_6\\\\sin6\\\\varphi+B_8\\\\sin8\\\\varphi-\\\\cdots-\\\\frac{2n\\\\sin2\\\\varphi}{\\\\sqrt{1+2n\\\\cos2\\\\varphi+n^2}}\\\\right)\\\\,. Generalized series The above series, to eighth order in eccentricity or fourth order in third flattening, provide millimetre accuracy. With the aid of symbolic algebra systems, they can easily be extended to sixth order in the third flattening which provides full double precision accuracy for terrestrial applications. Delambre and Bessel both wrote their series in a form that allows them to be generalized to arbitrary order. The coefficients in Bessel's series can expressed particularly simply :B_{2k} = \\\\begin{cases} c_0\\\\,, & \\\\text{if }k = 0\\\\,, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5px] \\\\dfrac{c_k}{k}\\\\,, & \\\\text{if } k > 0\\\\,, \\\\end{cases} where :c_k = \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(2j-3)!!\\\\, (2j+2k-3)!!}{(2j)!!\\\\, (2j+2k)!!} n^{k+2j} and is the double factorial, extended to negative values via the recursion relation: and . The coefficients in Helmert's series can similarly be expressed generally by :H_{2k} = (-1)^k (1-2k)(1+2k) B_{2k}\\\\,. This result was conjected by HelmertHelmert (1880), ¬ß1.11 and proved by Kawase.Kawase, K. (2011): A General Formula for Calculating Meridian Arc Length and its Application to Coordinate Conversion in the Gauss-Kr√ºger Projection, Bulletin of the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 59, 1‚Äì13 The factor results in poorer convergence of the series in terms of compared to the one in . The quarter meridian is given by :m_\\\\mathrm{p} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi(a+b)}4 c_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi(a+b)}4 \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty\\\\left(\\\\frac{(2j-3)!!}{(2j)!!}\\\\right)^2 n^{2j}\\\\,, a result which was first obtained by Ivory. Numerical expressions The trigonometric series given above can be conveniently evaluated using Clenshaw summation. This method avoids the calculation of most of the trigonometric functions and allows the series to be summed rapidly and accurately. The technique can also be used to evaluate the difference while maintaining high relative accuracy. Substituting the values for the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the WGS84 ellipsoid gives :\\\\begin{align} m(\\\\varphi)&=\\\\left(111\\\\,132.952\\\\,55\\\\,\\\\varphi^{(\\\\circ)}-16\\\\,038.509\\\\,\\\\sin 2\\\\varphi+16.833\\\\,\\\\sin4\\\\varphi-0.022\\\\,\\\\sin6\\\\varphi+0.000\\\\,03\\\\,\\\\sin8\\\\varphi\\\\right)\\\\mbox{ metres} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(111\\\\,132.952\\\\,55\\\\,\\\\beta^{(\\\\circ)}-5\\\\,346.170\\\\,\\\\sin 2\\\\beta-1.122\\\\,\\\\sin4\\\\beta-0.001\\\\,\\\\sin6\\\\beta-0.5\\\\times10^{-6}\\\\,\\\\sin8\\\\beta\\\\right)\\\\mbox{ metres,} \\\\end{align} where is expressed in degrees (and similarly for ).

Therefore, is the radius of the circle whose circumference is the same as the perimeter of a meridian ellipse. This defines the rectifying Earth radius as . On the ellipsoid the exact distance between parallels at and is . For WGS84 an approximate expression for the distance between the two parallels at ¬±0.5¬∞ from the circle at latitude is given by :\\\\Delta m=(111\\\\,133 - 560\\\\cos 2\\\\varphi)\\\\mbox{ metres.} The inverse meridian problem for the ellipsoid In some problems, we need to be able to solve the inverse problem: given , determine . This may be solved by Newton's method, iterating :\\\\varphi_{i+1} = \\\\varphi_i - \\\\frac{m(\\\\varphi_i) - m}{M(\\\\varphi_i)}\\\\,, until convergence. A suitable starting guess is given by where :\\\\mu = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}2 \\\\frac m{m_\\\\mathrm{p}} is the rectifying latitude. Note that it there is no need to differentiate the series for , since the formula for the meridian radius of curvature can be used instead.

PBSCT is now a much more common procedure than its bone marrow harvest equivalent, this is in-part due to the ease and less invasive nature of the procedure. Studies suggest that PBSCT has a better outcome in terms of the number of hematopoietic stem cell (CD34+ cells) yield. Immature hematopoietic stem cells in the circulating blood that are similar to those in the bone marrow are collected by apheresis from a potential donor (PBSC collection). The product is then administered intravenously to the patient after treatment. The administered hematopoietic stem cells then migrate to the recipient's bone marrow, a process known as stem cell homing, where the transplanted cells override the previous bone marrow. This allows the bone marrow to recover, proliferate and continue producing healthy blood cells. The transplantation may be autologous (an individual's own blood cells saved earlier), allogeneic (blood cells donated by someone else with matching HLA), or syngeneic (blood cells donated by an identical twin). The apheresis procedure typically lasts for 4‚Äì6 hours, depending on the donor's total blood volume. Preparation prior to PBSC Collection =GCSF= Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) are naturally occurring glycoproteins that stimulate white blood cell proliferation. Filgrastim is a synthetic form of GCSF produced in E.coli. PBSC donors are given a course of GCSF prior to PBSC collection, this ensures a better outcome, as stem cell proliferation increases, thus increasing the number of peripheral stem cells in circulation. The course is usually given over a 4-day period prior to PBSC collection. Mild bone pain usually results due to the excessive stem cell crowding within the bone marrow. Complications Since allogeneic PBSCT involves transformation of blood between different individuals, this naturally carries more complications than autologous PBSCT. For example, calculations must be made to ensure consistency in the amount of total blood volume between the donor and recipient. If the total blood volume of the donor is less than that of the recipient (such as when a child is donating to an adult), multiple PBSCT sessions may be required for adequate collection. Performing such a collection in a single setting could result in risks such as hypovolemia, which could lead to cardiac arrest, thus health care providers must exercise careful precaution when considering donor-recipient matching in allogeneic PBSCT History An early example of a successful peripheral stem cell transplant was carried out in the wake of the 1999 Tokaimura nuclear accident. One of the two technicians who received the highest dose of radiation was treated with PBSCT in an attempt to restore his destroyed immune system. Cells from the patient's sister's bone marrow were administered, and in the following weeks successfully began dividing and differentiating into leukocytes, but several weeks later, the cells were found to have been mutated by the radiation still present within the patient's body, and were observed carrying out autoimmune responses. Later studies on the incident and subsequent use of PBSCT found that the transplant had also induced neoendothelialization of the aortic endothelium.

They square off in a battle for survival, while one of the Rangers takes a course of action that will alter his life forever.Jericho: Termination for Cause Plot A flashback shows Jake and several others arriving at the Richmond farm to find Bonnie in Stanley's arms, having died protecting Mimi from Goetz. Mimi is taken to the Medical Center, unconscious. Jake orders the Rangers to the Medical Center to protect Mimi. He tries to persuade Beck and his men to help them, but they are headed for New Bern. Beck warns Jake not to take any action against Goetz. At the farm, Goetz destroys Mimi's evidence against him, then takes his men to the Medical Centre for Mimi. Jake and the Rangers have barricaded themselves inside. Goetz demands to see Mimi, but Jake refuses. The situation becomes a standoff, and Goetz calls for back-up from Ravenwood. Goetz has the power to the Medical Center disconnected. Eric and Stanley learn that Gary‚Äôs wife has been brought to the scene by Ravenwood. Jake allows Gary to leave, and the Rangers realize that Ravenwood is taking their families hostage to force an end to the standoff. Hawkins returns home to find two Ravenwood men, who ask him to come to the hospital. Hawkins kills one and holds the other at gunpoint. He takes the Ravenwood uniform from the dead man and brings his hostage to the Medical Center. He has the Rangers let him and the hostage in, suggesting they use him as leverage if Ravenwood continues to threaten their families. Goetz hears that his two men are missing, and calls Fred, one of the Rangers guarding the Medical Center, which Emily sees. Hawkins and Jake ask Mimi why Goetz wanted her dead. Mimi reveals she has evidence of Goetz embezzling from Ravenwood. She recreates the evidence from J&R;'s records, then sends the evidence to J&R.; Jimmy informs Jake that their Ravenwood hostage has escaped. As the man couldn't have escaped without help, Jake realizes these is a traitor among them. Emily tells them about the phone call that she saw Fred receive earlier. They realize Fred is the traitor and decide to use him to feed false information to Goetz. Hawkins and Jake search the building for their escaped hostage, recapturing him after a firefight. Jake and Hawkins tell Fred that the hostage is still at large, and ask him to guard the back door. Fred allows the Ravenwood contractors to enter the building, but they find the entire Medical Center empty and believe that the Rangers have escaped to regroup at Stanley's farm. Fred discovers that the Rangers were hiding in the Medical Center's basement. In an attempt to redeem himself, Fred tells Jake that Goetz and his men are heading for a nearby crossroads to await reinforcements. The next morning, the Rangers wait near the crossroads. Senior Ravenwood officials arrive, confront Goetz about the embezzlement, and fire him. The new Ravenwood arrivals leave with Goetz's vehicles, leaving him and his men to walk back to town. Once the Ravenwood party leaves, Jake and the Rangers ambush Goetz and his men, prompting a firefight. Russell and his men from New Beck arrive and join in. Goetz surrenders, and Jake and Russell argue over who will take custody of him. Stanley arrives and shoots Goetz in the head, killing him in revenge for Bonnie. Jake eventually agrees to let Russell's men take the body back to New Bern, where Beck finds his body hung from a tree. Reception Geoff Berkshire at the LA Times commented on the death of Goetz: \\"I'm not big on the whole vengeance-killings-in-entertainment concept, but last night's Jericho made it work, thanks to the sensitive performance of series regular Brad Beyer (as Stanley) and the loathsome turn from recurring guest D.B. Sweeney (as Goetz)....

Born in India, he was educated at Liverpool University, and worked initially with local authorities in the south of England. In 1959 he took a post as senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, and was appointed Professor of Urban Design and Regional Planning in 1964. In 1962 he founded the planning consultancy Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates, which was commissioned to masterplan the University of Edinburgh's Comprehensive Development Area in the 1960s. The practice was involved in urban planning and redevelopment in the UK and abroad. He is well known for being the main Architect of Celtic Park. Early life and work Johnson-Marshall was born in Ajmer, India, to English parents, and was raised in England from the 1920s. He attended the School of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, where his older brother, Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, was already studying. Tutors at Liverpool included Sir Patrick Abercrombie and Sir Charles Herbert Reilly. After graduating in 1936 he worked for Middlesex County Council, then for Willesden Borough Council, before moving to Coventry City Council in 1938, where he worked as Senior Assistant Architect under Chief Architect Donald Gibson, until called up for war service in 1941. He was elected to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1938. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Engineers in India and Burma, attaining the rank of Major. Post-war, he remained in Burma for a year, advising the Burmese Government on planning and reconstruction, and preparing a reconstruction plan for the country, in collaboration with William Tatton-Brown. After his return to the UK, he was employed as an Assistant Regional Planning Officer at the new Ministry of Town and Country Planning, during which time the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, the first planning law in the UK, was drawn up. In 1947 he was elected member of the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), also serving as a member of council and of the Education Committee. In 1948 he gained a Diploma in Town Planning from the School of Planning and Research for Regional Development (SPRRD), London, where he later worked as a part-time teacher. Johnson- Marshall worked as a Senior Planner with London County Council from 1949 to 1959, overseeing several Comprehensive Development Areas, including Lansbury Estate.  Academic career  In 1959 Johnson-Marshall was appointed Senior Lecturer in the University of Edinburgh's Department of Architecture. A new department of Urban Design and Regional Planning was established in 1964, with Percy Johnson-Marshall as the first professor, within the School of the Built Environment headed by Sir Robert Matthew. He founded the planning Research Unit at the University, which was involved in the preparation of several regional plans for areas of southern Scotland, and undertook regional surveys for the Scottish Development Department. In 1966 his book Rebuilding Cities was published. In recognition of his services to the planning profession, Johnson-Marshall was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1975. In 1985 he retired from the professorship, to become director of the Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies. He suffered an illness in 1987-1988, and retired as director as a result. Private practice Percy Johnson-Marshall & Associates (PJMA) was established as a planning consultancy in 1962. The firm was founded following Johnson-Marshall's appointment as planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh, and specialised in urban design and regional planning. The practice undertook master plans for cities including Sao Paulo, Brazil, Porto, Portugal, and Islamabad in Pakistan. Within the UK, PJMA worked on redevelopment schemes across the UK, in towns including Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, and Salford in Greater Manchester. After 1980, Johnson-Marshall's input declined, and the practice became more architecture focussed. Following Johnson-Marshall's retirement in 1985, the firm was known as Percy Johnson- Marshall & Partners (PJMP) until it was rebranded in 2003 as jmarchitects. The firm acquired Glasgow practice McKeown Alexander in 2001, and Edinburgh architects Wheeler & Sproson in 2005, and now employs nearly 150 people in five offices across the UK. Johnson-Marshall's brother Stirrat co-founded the architecture practice Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall, now known as RMJM, in 1956, with Sir Robert Matthew.

Code data  *IATA Code: EXC *ICAO Code: EX *Callsign: Originally Camelot then Excalibur Company history Excalibur Airways Airbus A320 at Faro Airport in 1992. Excalibur Airways was formed in the spring of 1992 and was based at the East Midlands Airport. It began charter operations with three leased Airbus A320s and most of the flights were out of London Gatwick airport. In 1994, one more A320 and a Boeing 737-300 were added. Excalibur was the first UK charter airline to operate the A320 with its (at the time) new fly-by-wire control system. Most of the holiday charter flights were to Egypt, although that was not the only destination since they also serviced the holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and North Africa. In 1994 Excaliber offered direct services from Gatwick into Eilat (ETH) in Southern Israel. ETH is conveniently right in the town centre and at the time almost all other operators were flying into Ovda (VDA), which is about an hour by coach to the North of the town. The downside was that, because of weight limitations, return flights had to make a refuelling stop at Tel Aviv (TLV) before continuing on to Gatwick. By the summer of 1995, the company had two aircraft operating from London Gatwick airport, one from Manchester, one from East Midlands airport, and one operating north eastern airports, including Newcastle and Humberside. Flights were still operated to Egypt, as well as to popular Mediterranean destinations such as Spain, Greece, Turkey, Italy, and further afield to the Canary Islands. Some charter flights also flew to Iceland, and other non-holiday destinations such as Frankfurt. During 1995 the company operated solely with A320 aircraft. Then, at the end of 1995, the company wanted to start flights to Florida and the Caribbean, so there was a need for a larger aircraft with more range and the Douglas DC-10-30 was chosen. Then the airline lost most of its medium-range charter contracts and the service problems that followed forced the travel operators to withdraw their contracts, hence, Excalibur shut down in June 1996. An incident with a DC-10 seen with smoke coming from the aircraft followed by an aborted take-off shattered public confidence in the airline.

The National Portrait Gallery has some 850 lithographs of his portraits and figure studies, done between 1825 and 1850. The images include portraits of royalty, society notables and theatre personalities. Life The elder brother of Edward William Lane, and second son of the Rev. Theophilus Lane, LL.D., prebendary of Hereford, he was born at Berkeley Castle, 16 February 1800. His mother was a niece of Thomas Gainsborough the painter. At the age of sixteen he was articled to Charles Heath the line-engraver. In 1824, his prints were already attracting notice, and in 1827, when he produced an engraving of Sir Thomas Lawrence's ‚ÄòRed Riding Hood,‚Äô he was elected an associate-engraver of the Royal Academy, although he had shown only a single print at their exhibitions. In later years, he helped obtain in 1865, the admission of engravers to the honour of full academician. In 1837, he was appointed lithographer to the queen, and in 1840 to Albert, Prince Consort. In 1864, when he had almost given up lithography, he became director of the etching class in the science and art department at the South Kensington Museum, and retained the post almost till his death, which took place on 21 November 1872. Among his close friends were Charles Kemble, William Macready, Charles Fechter, Maria Felici√° Malibran, and her operatic contemporaries. Works In 1829 he drew a well-known portrait of the future Queen Victoria, aged ten years, and he later executed portraits in pencil or chalk of the queen and most of the royal family at various ages, besides prints after Franz Xaver Winterhalter's portraits. He turned from engraving to lithography. He produced in this medium Sketches from Gainsborough, and a series of copies of Sir Thomas Lawrence's portraits of George IV's cycle. He also lithographed several hundred pictures of the leading artists of the day, especially those of Charles Robert Leslie, Edwin Landseer, George Richmond, and his own special friend John James Chalon; in all 67 of his lithographs were exhibited at the Academy. The total of his prints reached the number of 1,046. He also tried his hand at sculpture, including a life-size seated statue of his brother, Edward Lane, in Egyptian dress. His ‚ÄòLife at the Water-cure,‚Äô 1846, went to three editions. He also edited Charles Kemble's ‚ÄòReadings from Shakspeare‚Äô in 3 vols. in 1870. Family Richards' family was very accomplished as well. His brother is the notable English orientalist Edward William Lane and his sister Sophia Lane Poole was also an orientalist and author. His nephews Reginald Stuart Poole and Stanley Lane-Poole were also famous orientalist and archaeologist. Lane married, 10 November 1825, Sophia Hodges, by whom he had two sons (who predeceased him) and three daughters.

Ford Captain John Baptiste Ford (November 17, 1811 ‚Äì May 1, 1903) was an American industrialist and founder of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, now known as PPG Industries, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Early life Born in a log cabin in Danville, Kentucky, he never remembered his father, Jonathan Ford, who in 1813 joined the Kentucky Volunteer Homespun regiment to fight the British forces at New Orleans in the War of 1812 and never returned. His mother, Margaret, the daughter of Jean Baptiste, an immigrant from France who had fought in the American Revolutionary War, apprenticed young John at the age of 12 to a Danville saddlemaker. He ran away from the saddlemaker at age 14 and found his freedom in Greenville, Indiana, where he remained for the next 30 years. Greenville, Indiana Ford began as an apprentice with his future father-in-law in the local saddle shop which led him into his first business venture. In 1831 at age 20, Ford married his school teacher Mary Bower (25 years old). The couple had two children both born in Greenville; Edward Ford (1843) and Emory Low Ford (1846). The couple operated a small dry goods store. Ford purchased The Station building which housed an old mill and saddle shop from its owner. He added a grocery and began making tin pie safes which he sold throughout the country. Pictured are Captain John B Ford and his wife Mary Bowers Ford, circa 1864. The Station building, the original building that housed the old mill, saddle shop and grocery, still stands today. Historically referred to as The Station (sometimes the Old Mill and Ford's Flour Mill), the Greenville Station is the oldest commercial building in Greenville. Construction on the original wooden structure began in 1810 and finished in 1812. In 1840, Ford helped to erect the present brick structure. The Station was a stop for the 104-mile stagecoach route that ran from Falls Cities to the Wabash River. Ford and his wife Mary had seven children. Their first child, Charles, died within nine months of birth. Their second child, John, died at 10 months. Their third child, Henry Ford, died when he was 15 years old. Their fourth child, a daughter, died at age of 8. Their fifth child, Mary, only lived for five days. Their sixth child, Edward Ford (1843‚Äì1920) and seventh child, Emory Low Ford (1846‚Äì1900), went on to work in the family business. New Albany, Indiana Pictured is a collection of steamboats produced by Captain John Baptiste Ford in New Albany, Indiana. Ford moved to New Albany in 1854 and opened a factory to manufacture feed-cutting boxes constructed of wood and iron. Needing a reliable source of iron for his box manufacturing business, Ford built his own rolling mill and foundry and eventually produced railroad and commercial iron products. =Captain Ford & Steamboat Production= By the late 1850s, Ford realized he could not compete with the industrial iron giants located in the iron regions around Pittsburgh, and he converted his factory into a shipyard to produce steamboats. Ford produced his own steamboat line and was addressed as \\"Captain Ford\\" by many of New Albany's residents. During the Civil War, many of Ford's boats were utilized by the Union forces. =New Albany Glass Works= J.B. Ford & Sons in New Albany, Indiana Ford's son Emory graduated in July 1864 from Duff's Mercantile College upriver in Pittsburgh. Emory marveled at the many glass works in the city, and soon they set up a small glass factory in New Albany known as the New Albany Glass Works. The company produced bottles and jars. In 1867, the Fords had greatly expanded the factory and began to study the technology to produce plate glass, which until now was imported from Europe. In 1870, they had successfully mastered the technology and had the skilled workforce in place to produce the first plate glass in the United States. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company In 1880, Ford left New Albany and opened the New York City Plate Glass Company with a plant in Creighton, Pennsylvania. In 1883, the business was reorganized as the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (\\"PPG\\"). PPG became the leading plate glass manufacturing facility in the country. Tired of disagreements with their business partners, Ford sold his interest in the company in 1897. He formed a new venture to the west near Toledo, Ohio, the Ford Glass Company. It later became Libbey Owens Ford Glass Company. At one time he was in business with his first cousin, Washington Charles De Pauw. Wyandotte Chemical Company In 1893, Ford founded a chemical company that supplied vital soda ash for the glass production. The company was located in Wyandotte, Michigan and named Michigan Alkali Company. Later, the company was renamed Wyandotte Chemical Company and became one of the nation's leading chemical firms at the time of John B. Ford's death, eventually becoming part of BASF and expanding into the BASF industrial complex. Ford City, Michigan In 1902, the village was named in honor of Captain Ford, who at the time was President of the Michigan Alkali Company (now BASF Wyandotte) and prominent citizen in local affairs. All was not going well in Ford City during its years of growing. The Michigan Alkali Company had spread out along the Detroit River into both Ford City and Wyandotte. Each municipally assessed and taxed the chemical company differently. Certain necessary services and utilities readily available in Wyandotte were not available in Ford City. The Michigan Alkali Company had strongly sought tax relief and expanded utility services and suggested merging the two communities. Ford City and Wyandotte merged in 1922. Ford City, Pennsylvania Ford City was founded in 1887 as a company town by the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG Industries) as the site for its Works No. 3 glass factory. The town was named in honor of the company founder, John Baptiste Ford. The factory employed as many as 5,000 workers in its heyday. PPG shut down its Ford City operations in the 1990s. The once largest employer in Armstrong County, Eljer Plumbing, shut down its Ford City plant in 2008. In 1900, 2,870 people resided in Ford City borough proper; in 1910, 4,850 people lived there; in 1930, 6,127; and, in 1940, 5,795. The population was 3,451 at the 2000 census. John Baptiste Ford Drive On December 11, 2017, the Town Council in Greenville, Indiana named a historic roadway after John Baptiste Ford. The roadway butts up to The Station Building which was originally built by Ford in the 1840s. The Station Building still stands today and is the oldest commercial building in town. Death John Ford died at his home in Tarentum, Pennsylvania in 1903. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. The town of Ford City, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 31 May 2008. It is the first of a two-part story; the second part, \\"Forest of the Dead\\", aired on 7 June. The two episodes make up the second two-parter Steven Moffat contributed to the series after \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" from the first series. In the episode, the archaeologist River Song (Alex Kingston) summons the alien time traveller the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) to a planet-sized library in the 51st century, where thousands of visitors disappeared without a trace a hundred years earlier when the library was shut off. The episode establishes that River Song has met the Doctor on many occasions but at this point in his life the Doctor does not recognise her. The Hugo Award-nominated episode is also significant for introducing the character of River Song, who went on to play an important role in future stories. A few days before the episode aired, the BBC announced that Moffat was to become head writer of the programme for the show's fifth series in 2010, replacing then-current head writer Russell T Davies, who held the role since Doctor Who returned to television in 2005. Plot The Tenth Doctor and Donna land on a planet-sized library in the 51st century simply called the Library. The Doctor has been summoned there, but a scan for life shows the Doctor and Donna as the only humanoid life signs but trillions of nonhuman life forms they cannot see or hear are present. An information node tells the Doctor and Donna that the library sealed itself, but that it has been breached and others are coming. Just then, a team of explorers led by archaeologist River Song (who sent the message) and financed by Strackman Lux, whose grandfather originally built the Library, arrives. The team has come to determine why the library sealed itself 100 years previously. River acts like she knows the Doctor and has a diary with a cover decorated like the TARDIS with her. She discovers the Doctor has not met her yet. The Library's operation system appears to be connected to the mind of a young girl living on 21st-century Earth. When the Doctor attempts to access the library computers, the girl causes books to fly from the shelves. The events happening in the library appear to her as television shows. The girl's psychiatrist Dr. Moon tells her that the library in her imagination is actually real and that her real world is a lie. He implores her to save the people who have arrived at the library. Lux's secretary Miss Evangelista is attacked by Vashta Nerada which strip her flesh clean to the bone instantly. The Doctor and Donna learn that the team are wearing communication devices which can store their thought patterns even after death, and are disturbed to hear Miss Evangelista still talking but acting confused until her pattern degrades. The Doctor explains that the Vashta Nerada are creatures that appear as shadows to hunt but are usually not as aggressive. After noticing the pilot Proper Dave has two shadows, the Doctor and River seal him in his space suit, with the Doctor discovering River has a sonic screwdriver. The Vashta Nerada still get in, stripping Dave to his bare skeleton. The creatures animate Dave's suit and chase after the others. The Doctor attempts to teleport Donna back to the TARDIS for her safety, but Donna fails to materialise properly. The Doctor finds an information node with Donna's face on it which tells him that Donna has left the library and been saved. =Continuity= According to Steven Moffat, the squareness gun used by Song to help the party escape from the impending Vashta Nerada is intended to be the same sonic blaster that was used by Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) in the episode \\"The Doctor Dances\\". Moffat suggests that it was left in the TARDIS after \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", and taken by Song in the Doctor's future. The name \\"squareness gun\\" was coined by Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in the former episode. Production =Writing= Originally, the two-parter was scheduled to take place during the show's third series. Initially, Moffat had wanted to introduce the villainous Weeping Angels in the entry after seeing an angel statue in a graveyard whilst on a family holiday. However, after withdrawing from the writing of series three's first two-part story‚ÄîHelen Raynor took over these episodes, writing \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" and \\"Evolution of the Daleks\\"‚ÄîMoffat volunteered to write the series' Doctor-lite episode and opted to use the Weeping Angels in what would become \\"Blink\\". Later, during the fourth series, Moffat revisited his previous ideas. He felt that the library would be a \\"great setting\\" for Doctor Who that was not too exotic. The character of River Song was originally created for the plot to make more sense. Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor, but that the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to know one of the archaeologists. Later, he decided that this idea was too \\"dull\\", and instead opted to have one of them know him. =Casting= For the role of River Song, whom executive producer Russell T Davies described as \\"sort of the Doctor's wife\\", the production sought to cast Kate Winslet. One of Winslet's first acting roles was in the BBC1 teen drama Dark Season, written by Davies. The role of River Song eventually went to Alex Kingston, known for starring in the popular US drama ER. On Kingston's casting, Davies said \\"I bloody love her!\\"Davies, Russell T; Benjamin Cook (17 September 2008). \\"The Next Doctor\\". The Times (News Corporation). Retrieved 17 September 2008. Kingston had been a fan of Doctor Who as a child. Kingston did not initially expect her role to be recurring, only later learning that Moffat had always intended for Song to come back for return appearances. Kingston enjoyed getting to play an unusual action hero female role, and praised the show for its variety of settings and opportunities \\"to relive one's childhood fantasies\\" playing with laser guns and wearing varied costumes from one appearance to the next. In regards to having to speak complicated dialogue, she said that she had \\"work[ed] with a medical consultant on ER, who'd explain what we were saying, so I'd say it with a purpose and a truth. On Doctor Who, I've no idea what some of my lines mean!\\" Discussing her role alongside Tennant and Tate in her 2008 introductory episode, Kingston said, \\"We just clicked. I've done guest roles on other shows, but rarely have I felt such a warm bond.\\" About working with Kingston, Tate later said that, \\"I'm a huge ER fan. When you hold people in awe, it's almost a disappointment when they come in and they're utterly normal. But Alex isn't disappointing at all. She's such a lovely person.\\" Tennant was quoted as saying that, \\"Alex is terrific. When she's telling you stories about hanging out with George Clooney, you know she's pretty cool.\\" Colin Salmon later played Salway in the audio play Wirrn Dawn. Daniel Peacock, the brother of Harry Peacock, who here plays Proper Dave, had previously appeared in the 1988 serial The Greatest Show in the Galaxy as Nord the Vandal. =Filming and effects= Filming took place at the Old Swansea Central Library in late January and early February 2008, and the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea, Wales. The presence of the Vashta Nerada was created with lighting managed by director of photography Rory Taylor. To draw the eye toward the shadows, they were deepened in post-production by visual effects company The Mill. Broadcast and reception =Release and ratings= Before the episode was aired, The Sun obtained a copy of the script and threatened to release it, to which Moffat responded: \\"'let them' ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to see The Sun publish that many words in a day!\\" As in 2007, the BBC pushed Doctor Who a week further due to their coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 which took place on 24 May. \\"Silence in the Library\\" was scheduled against the final of ITV's talent contest Britain's Got Talent and suffered in the ratings as a result. BARB's final figures recorded an audience 6.27 million when adjusted for time shifting. Britain's Got Talent was viewed by 11.52 million in comparison. This was the first time since the series' revival in 2005 that Doctor Who did not have the largest audience share in its timeslot. However, the episode did receive an Appreciation Index score of 89 (considered \\"Excellent\\"), the joint highest figure the new series had received to date, alongside \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", \\"Doomsday\\" and the following episode \\"Forest of the Dead\\". BBC Three's repeat of the episode was watched by 1.35 million viewers, almost double the figures for the equivalent repeat of the previous episode, \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\". =Critical reception and accolades= The episode has received positive reviews from critics. William Gallagher of Radio Times labelled it the \\"best story so far\\" and was positive toward the character of River Song. IGN's Travis Fickett gave it a rating of 9.2 out of 10, praising the setting of a library with books and \\"terrifically entertaining dialogue, one mind boggling concept after another, terrific character moments\\" between all the characters. However, he thought the concept of the Vashta Nerada were \\"a bit goofy\\", especially when they took the form of the skeletons. Ben Rawson-Jones on Digital Spy gave \\"Silence in the Library\\" four out of five stars, praising the \\"wonderfully inventive concepts\\" of the Data Ghosts and Nodes as well as guest stars Kingston, Salmon, and Newton. However, his \\"slight criticism\\" was that some aspects were similar to other episodes Moffat had written for Doctor Who. Richard Edwards, reviewing for SFX, gave the episode five out of five stars and called it the \\"best of the series so far\\". He particularly praised the fear instilled by the Vashta Nerada and the \\"intriguing parallel plotline\\" of the little girl. Den of Geek listed the cliffhanger for \\"Silence in the Library\\" among the tenth greatest of the show in 2011. IGN named the two-parter the fourth best episode of Tennant's tenure, as did Sam McPherson of Zap2it. This episode, along with \\"Forest of the Dead\\", was nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category, but lost out to Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. The episode won the 2009 Constellation Award for Best Script in Film or Television.

Between 1889 and 1892 an infirmary was added with 185 beds for vagrants. During the First World War it became the Reading War Hospital. In 1930 it became a municipal hospital, taking the name Battle Hospital for the first time. In 1948, by now with 384 beds, Battle Hospital became a general hospital under the new National Health Service. In 1952 a new maternity unit, Thames Block, opened. In 1972 the new single storey Abbey block opened. By 1993, Battle Hospital had 280 beds, compared with 760 beds at Reading's other general hospital, the Royal Berkshire Hospital. Both hospitals were administered by the Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospitals NHS Trust. In 2005 the hospital closed, with all its patients and services transferred to the Royal Berkshire Hospital.

The Camp is located in South India, 700 km South of Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. In the late 1970s the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (also known as the Tamil Tigers) began an armed conflict with the Sri Lankan government. The clash peaked in the early 1980s and erupted into a full-scale civil war in 1983. Thousands were killed and many were displaced. Many Tamils left Sri Lanka and sought refugee status in places like Canada and the United Kingdom. Those lacking money or family connections were left behind. With nowhere else to go, these people left Sri Lanka by boat from the northern town of Mannar, (18 km from the Indian coast) and arrived in Mandapam, India. The state government of Tamil Nadu placed these people in camps across the state. Currently there are approximately 70,000 refugees living in these camps. A five-year peace agreement was signed in 2002. However, the conflict resumed in 2005 and by 2008 there were an estimated 4000 deaths.

CDOT owns six of the locomotives, which it painted in its \\"McGinnis\\" paint scheme, named after former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad president Patrick B. McGinnis.

These locomotives are used in branch service on the Metro-North Railroad, including the Danbury Branch and Waterbury Branch. They are used on shuttle trains operating on routes where there is no third rail (such as the tracks from Southeast to Wassaic). They lack third-rail shoes and thus rarely operate into Grand Central Terminal. The BL20GH locomotives are currently undergoing an overhaul, where they will be rebuilt and reclassified as BL20GHM.

The estate was classified a Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel in 1932, and most recently a Cru Bourgeois Sup√©rieur in 2003,crus-bourgeois.com 2003 Official List.pdf in a classification which has been inactive since 2007. The estate also produces a second wine, La Ferme d'Angludet, and a clairet named Clairet d'Angludet.  History  The estate originates from the 12th Century at least, under the ownership of Chevalier Bernard d'Angludet when there was a manor house on the property. It came to a succession of owners such as the Donisan family, Rampnol de Corn, the Treulon family, the de Makanan family until it was confiscated in 1631 during the religious wars, and eventually passed to Pierre du Mons, by whose period viticulture had been established, and in the early 18th century the wine sold for a good price. In 1776 d'Angludet was acquired by Pierre Legas and d'Angludet had come to be considered a fourth growth (in the tiers below the first growths), but with Legras' death in 1791, the property was divided among four sons who did not pursue a continuity of standards, and d'Angludet was not mentioned in any of the early classifications of the 1820s, nor in Cocks & F√©ret of 1846. Omitted for classification in Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, David Peppercorn describes the coverage in the 1874 F√©ret documents as \\"a melancholy state of affairs\\". With two of the four portions bought by Paul Promis in the late 19th century, there was the start of a revival, under the name Domaine d'Angludet, and under Jules Jadouin in 1891 the former estate was reunited exactly a century after its division, eventually along with a reestablished reputation of excellence. Continuing under a succession of owners, the estate was ranked well at the 1932 Cru Bourgeois classification. The property fell into a state of neglect following World War II, and was in ruins until 1961 when it was coincidentally noticed by Peter Sichel, a part owner of Ch√¢teau Palmer, while on an afternoon stroll, and the derelict direction of the property became reversed. Once acquired, the vineyards were completely restructured, and the property restored, eventually prompting Alexis Lichine to publish that d'Angludet deserved a higher classification which he incorporated into his Classification des Grands Crus Rouges de Bordeaux. In 1989, Benjamin Sichel took over the management of the estate and continued production with a view to optimise the vines‚Äô natural balance. Of Maison Sichel, the family has owned a Bordeaux n√©gociant business since 1883 and remains a significant shareholder in Ch√¢teau Palmer. Production The vineyard area, situated next to the vineyards of Ch√¢teau du Tertre and Ch√¢teau Giscours, extends cultivated with the grape varieties of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. Of the Grand vin Ch√¢teau d'Angludet there is typically produced 10,000 cases per year, and of the second wine La Ferme d'Angludet about 2,000 cases. There is also a clairet- style wine made from a saign√©e after the wines have been in vat for only a few hours, named Clairet d'Angludet.

The River Tib is a minor tributary of the River Medlock in Manchester, England. It has been culverted along its entire length since about 1820 and now runs beneath Manchester city centre. Tib Street () and Tib Lane are named after the watercourse. During the Roman period, the Tib marked the boundary of the vicus or settlement of Mamucium; the river continued to mark Manchester's boundary until medieval times, as well as providing drinking water. A notion concerning the Tib's name, coined by Geoffrey Ashworth in his book The Lost Rivers of Manchester, is that the river was given its name by homesick Roman soldiers after the River Tiber, but with the word shortened to reflect the size difference between the two rivers. Alternatively, the name may derive from the Celtic word for \\"watercourse\\". The river's source is a spring in Miles Platting (), from where it flows underneath Oldham Road and the eponymous Tib Street to reach the city centre. After flowing underneath West Mosley Street, the Tib crosses Princess Street to flow underneath the Manchester Town Hall Extension, the Central Library and the Midland Hotel's dining room, before joining the Medlock at Gaythorn (now First Street, ), close to Deansgate railway station.

Scott in his review of Kimmel, Short, & McVay's \\"Case Studies in Individual Rights of Military Commanders: Executive Authority, Law and the Commander\\", in Military Law Review, Volume 156 (1995), 52‚Äì199. Early life and education Arnheiter was born to Theodore and Dorothy B. Arnheiter. He had a twin brother, Theodore Jr. (d. 2005), and a sister, Dorothy. Raised in New York City, he was graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1952 and obtained his master's degree from Georgetown. USS Vance (DER-387) On 22 December 1965, just before Christmas, on Bravo Pier, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Arnheiter took command of the USS Vance, a ship which was, in his opinion, unready for war. Having found it, in his words, \\"crawling with cockroaches\\", he instituted measures to get the ship cleaned up, to get the crew trained, and to institute activities which he thought would get the crew motivated. Arnheiter also had more than his share of personality quirks, which led members of the crew to keep a \\"Mad Marcus Log\\". One of the duties of the Vance was to search small coastal traffic (junks) for contraband, specifically weapons to be used by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. Since the Vance's motor whaleboat was lacking in speed, Arnheiter had a speedboat purchased for that purpose; however, he used special services (welfare & recreation) money‚Äîa misappropriation of funds. Arnheiter also had the navigation personnel falsify the logs when he ordered the Vance closer to the coast than his orders allowed. Eventually word of these activities (and other allegations), including the complaints listed in the \\"Mad Marcus Log\\", reached higher command headquarters staff, most likely by way of a chaplain in whom the sailors had confided.Scheck, William (2000). The Vance Mutiny: Fact Mirrors Fiction. Retrieved from http://ussvance.com/Vance/smithg/smithtxt.htm. Three months after he assumed command, headquarters ordered the Vance to Manila for refitting. On 31 March 1966, Arnheiter was summarily relieved. In an attempt to clear his name, Arnheiter sought a court martial from the Navy, but the Navy never took any additional action against him. Although he then swore out formal charges against the Navy, Arnheiter was not so much as reprimanded for charging that two- and three-star admirals had themselves been guilty of gross violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Arnheiter said that, either way, he should be the subject of a court martial‚Äîfor his alleged actions on the Vance or for his related charges against selected superior officers. The Navy ignored his requests. Arnheiter went so far as to participate in formal congressional hearingsThe U.S. Congressional Record on the matter, and still the Navy ignored his demands for redress in any official capacity. On repeated appeals, his case was dismissed.\\"Miscellaneous\\" note in Military Affairs, Volume 43 Issue 3 (1979 October), 153. According to a Time magazine article, one officer admitted: \\"We all have a little of the Captain Queeg in us...But Arnheiter had more than his share.\\" Suppressed book Journalist Neil Sheehan wrote a book titled The Arnheiter Affair in 1971, including a little-known indicium that Arnheiter, prior to his enrollment in the Naval Academy, had briefly been enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.For the Arnheiter case and matters related to it from Sheehan's perspective, Nan Thompson Ernst, John R. Monagle, & Thelma M. Queen wrote in 1994 an available analysis of Sheehan's papers, titled Neil Sheehan: A Register of His Papers in the Library of Congress. The Arnheiter Affair was well received. Litigation, however, brought by Arnheiter for libel and slander caused the book to be removed from print.Archives of Arnheiter's case are maintained by the Columbia University library. See Columbia University Archives, Box 31. Retired U.S. Air Force astronaut Frank Borman, USMA Class of 1950, confirms in his autobiography that Arnheiter was a member of the same cadet company (H-1), and that Arnheiter had been expelled from West Point, only to be subsequently admitted to the Naval Academy.Borman, F. and Serling, R.

It provides for several diverse matters relating to the law, some of them being significant changes to the structure of the courts and fundamental legal procedures. Part 1 provides a scheme for radical overhaul of the tribunal system in the UK, creating a new unified structure with two new tribunals to embrace the former fragmented scheme, along with a Senior President of Tribunals. Part 2 defines new criteria for appointment as a judge, generally reducing the length of experience required with the aim of increasing diversity in the judiciary. Part 3 creates a new system of taking control of goods in order to enforce judgments and abolishes ancient common law writs and remedies such as fieri facias, replevin and distress for rent. It introduces a modern system of 'certified enforcement agents' and 'exempted enforcement agents' which includes civil servants such as court officers and County Court bailiffs, civilian enforcement officers and police officers. Part 4 makes some changes to attachment of earnings and charging orders to make recovery of debts more straightforward. Part 5 makes some changes to insolvency practice in order to provide low-cost protection for people who have previously been excluded owing to their small debts and lack of assets. Part 6 provides protection from seizure for foreign antiquities and artefacts on display in the UK and whose provenance is alleged to be broken by misappropriation. Such artefacts can only be seized on a court order that was compelled by a Community obligation or a treaty obligation. Tribunals and inquiries These provisions started to come into force on 19 September 2007. Though , no dates have been set for completing the process, the first tribunals under the new system are planned to sit from 3 November 2008.Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.1) Order 2007, SI 2007/2709Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.2) Order 2007, SI 2007/3613Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.3) Order 2008, SI 2008/749Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.4) Order 2008, SI 2008/1158Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2008, SI 2008/1653 =Background= In the UK, tribunals have been created on an ad hoc basis to perform various judicial functions, for example Employment Tribunals and Asylum and Immigration Tribunals. The tribunals' members were a mixture of judges, lawyers, experts and laypeople, and were regulated by various government departments and bodies. Though these tribunals were supervised by, and had rights of appeal within, the Courts of the United Kingdom, reform was recommended to create a unified and simplified structure, better integrated into the courts system. =New tribunal structure= Section 1 of the Act recognises legally qualified members of tribunals as members of the judiciary of the United Kingdom who are guaranteed continued judicial independence (s. 1).Constitutional Reform Act 2005, s.3 Section 3 of the Act creates two new tribunals to which existing jurisdictions will be transferred, a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal. The tribunals are divided into several chambers, each to bring together a single subject matter, for example employment. Some tribunals will still lie outside the new system. All legally- qualified members will take the title of judge. There will be a right of appeal on a question of law from the First-tier to the Upper Tribunal and some limited jurisdiction for judicial review. The Upper Tribunal will be a senior court of record. There is a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland or Court of Session (Scotland) (s. 13). The first chambers within the First-tier Tribunal are planned to start sitting on 3 November 2008. The Act replaces the Council on Tribunals with an Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council and creates the office of Senior President of Tribunals, to be appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. (s.2/ Sch.1). Chambers will be created flexibly by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Senior President of Tribunals and each will have its own Chamber President (s. 7/ Sch. 4). Tribunal judgments will carry a right to a warrant of execution or entry on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines and will no longer require to be registered in the County Court or High Court (s. 27). Judicial appointments These provisions started to come into force on 19 September 2007 and implementation was completed on 21 July 2008. =Background= In 2004, the Department of Constitutional Affairs consulted on means of increasing diversity among the judiciary in the UK. They concluded that the qualifications required to serve as a judge were a barrier to a broader judiciary and recommended that they be varied, in particular by shortening the period of legal practice demanded before seeking office. However, the consultation recognised the anomaly that a barrister or solicitor could seek office after a certain period of qualification, even had they never practised. =The judicial-appointment eligibility condition= The Act creates a judicial-appointment eligibility condition that a person (s.50(2)-(3)): *Holds a relevant qualification; and *Has gained experience in law for a specified period while holding a relevant qualification Relevant qualification is as a barrister or solicitor (s. 50) though the Lord Chancellor can extend this to members of the Institute of Legal Executives or other bodies (s. 51). The specified periods for which a relevant qualification must be held are generally reduced to five or seven years from the previous respective seven or ten (Sch. 10). In particular, qualification for appointment as a District Judge requires five years' experience and, as a Circuit Judge, seven years. Experience in law can be (s. 52): *Judicial functions of any court or tribunal; *Acting as an arbitrator; *Practice or employment as a lawyer; *Advising on the application of the law; *Assisting persons involved in proceedings for the resolution of issues arising under the law; *Acting as a mediator; *Drafting documents intended to affect persons' rights or obligations; *Teaching or researching law; *Other activities of a broadly similar nature. Sections 53-59 make various changes to the rules for appointing judges while section 60 requires that the chairman of the Law Commission is a judge of the High Court of England and Wales or the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Enforcement by taking control of goods no dates have been set for the coming into force of these provisions. =Background= The previous system of warrants of execution and writs of fieri facias was increasingly considered as cumbersome, confusing and old- fashioned. Further, general concern about unlawful, violent and threatening behaviour by bailiffs led to a Department for Constitutional Affairs White Paper proposing modernisation and regulation. =Distress for rent= Section 71 abolishes the ancient common law self-help remedy of distress for rent, replacing it, solely for leases on commercial property, by a statutory system of Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery (CRAR) (ss. 72-87/ Sch. 14). =Enforcing judgments against goods= Writs of fieri facias are renamed writs of control. Warrants of execution and warrants of distress are renamed warrants of control. Writs of fieri facias de bonis ecclesiasticis are unaffected. (s. 62). Section 65 abolishes the common law rules concerning: *Distinctions between an illegal, an irregular and an excessive exercise of a power; *Remedies available to the debtor; *Replevin; and *Rescuing goods. Schedules 12 and 13 create a new process of taking control of goods. =Enforcement agents= The Act replaces the ancient office of bailiff with that of enforcement agent (County Court bailiffs are still referred to as such). Section 63 of the Act restricts the role of enforcement agent to an individual who: *Acts under a certificate under the Act. Certificates can be issued by various judges and the Lord Chancellor has the power to make regulations for the granting of certificates (s. 64). *Is exempt because he acts in the course of his duty as: **A constable; **An officer of HM Revenue and Customs; **A person appointed under section 2(1) of the Courts Act 2003 (court officers and staff); *Acts in the presence or under the direction of one of the above; *Is exempt because he acts in the course of his duty as an officer of a government department. Otherwise, a person who knowingly or recklessly purports to act as an enforcement agent is guilty of a summary offence and, on conviction, can be fined up to level 5 on the standard scale (s. 63(6) -(7)). Enforcement of judgments and orders , no date is fixed for the coming into force of these provisions. =Background= Various problems were perceived to persist with the availability, quality and reliability of financial information from debtors. Attachment of earnings orders required the debtor to certify their own income and this was frequently misstated. Charging orders could not be made unless the debtor was in arrears with payments against the debt. This situation was perceived as offering opportunities for the debtor to dispose of valuable property while making modest instalments in the short term. Information hearings under Part 71 of the Civil Procedure Rules were widely perceived as ineffective. =Attachment of earnings orders= Section 91 and Schedule 15 amend the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 to allow deductions to be made on the basis of a fixed rate, similar to the scheme already used for Council Tax arrears. Section 92 amends the 1971 Act to give the court the power to seek information on the details of a debtor's current employer from HM Revenue and Customs. =Charging orders= Section 93 amends the Charging Orders Act 1979 to enable charging orders to be made even though the debtor is not in arrears of an order for payment of the debt by instalments. However, sale can only be ordered if instalments are missed. Section 94 gives the Lord Chancellor the power to make regulations setting minimum limits on the value of debts where these provisions can be used to prevent their being invoked unfairly or vexatiously. =Information requests and orders= Sections 95 to 105 establish a system of applications for information whereby a creditor can apply to the court for an information order to obtain information about the debtor's means from the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs, and third parties such as banks and credit reference agencies. Debt management and relief , no date is fixed for the coming into force of these provisions. =Background= Consultation by the Department for Constitutional Affairs suggested that some people, especially those with small debts and few assets, were excluded from the existing schemes for insolvency protection. In particular, the schemes of Administration Orders (AOs) and Enforcement Restriction Orders (EROs) were seen to be deficient. =AOs, EROs and DROs= The act makes changes to the schemes for AOs and EROs so that they are available to a broader class of people in financial difficulties (ss. 106-107/ Sch. 16). Section 108 and Schedules 17 to 20 amend the Insolvency Act 1986 to create a new instrument of Debt Relief Order (DRO). DROs are a low-cost scheme offered under narrow criteria for those currently excluded by the insolvency system. They will be administered by official receivers outside the courts' jurisdiction and will offer protection from creditors for a year. In 2007, it was estimated that there were 70,000 private, unregulated and unenforceable debt management schemes in operation in the UK. Sections 109 to 133 and Schedule 21 provide for a statutory system of Debt Management Schemes to regulate such practises. Protection of cultural artifacts These provisions came into effect in England on 31 December 2007, in Scotland on 21 April 2008,Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement) (Scotland) Order 2008, SSI 2008/150 and in Wales and Northern Ireland on 22 April 2008. =Background= The possibility that antiquities and cultural artifacts, sometimes allegedly misappropriated by their current custodians, would be seized by court order while on display in the UK, led to an increasing reluctance of foreign states and private individuals to allow loans for exhibitions. The provisions of the State Immunity Act 1978 were inadequate. Such uncertainties caused diplomatic tensions over a proposed loan of art works from Russia for an exhibition at the Royal Academy in December 2007. In particular, there was speculation that there might be attempts to seize Henri Matisse's The Dance which had been appropriated by the Bolshevik government from Sergei Shchukin during the Russian Revolution. The new provisions of this section of the Act came into force on 31 December and the Russian government gave permission for the paintings to travel to the UK and for the exhibition to go ahead on 9 January 2008. =Protection under the Act= Section 135 defines the articles to be protected as those normally kept and owned outside the UK, lawfully imported for display or exhibition at an approved museum or gallery. The protection lasts for a maximum of 12 months, unless the article is damaged while in the UK and is undergoing repair, and protection only lasts while the article is: *On public display in a temporary exhibition at a museum or gallery; *Going to or returning from public display in a temporary exhibition at a museum or gallery; *Undergoing related repair, conservation or restoration; *Going to or returning from related repair, conservation or restoration; *Leaving the UK. Protected articles cannot be seized save under a court order made in the UK and which the court was required to make because of a Community obligation or treaty obligation, or a statute giving effect to a Community obligation or treaty (s. 136(1)). The Act does not provide immunity against prosecution for importing, exporting or otherwise dealing with the article (s. 136(2)). These provisions of the Act bind the Crown (s. 138).See Crown Proceedings Act 1947, s. 2(2) References Bibliography * \\\\---- United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2007 Civil procedure Insolvency law of the United Kingdom Archaeological theft Art and cultural repatriation Courts of the United Kingdom Judiciary of England and Wales United Kingdom tribunals ","title":"Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007"},{"id":"16107729","text":"The Dappermarkt The Dappermarkt is a market on Dapperstraat in Amsterdam-east and is one of the busiest markets of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The European Renaissance was significantly triggered by the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 (resulting in a wave of Byzantine scholars fleeing to Italy). The Ottoman Empire reached its historical apogee in 1566, coinciding with the beginning of the scientific revolution in Europe, which would lead to the political dominance of emerging modern Europe over the course of the following century.

While the Treaty of Granada (1491) allowed the new subjects to keep practicing Islam, soon forced conversion was applied. The Granada Moors joined the earlier Iberian Moriscos. Some of them were Crypto-Muslims while others adhered sincerely to Christianity. Part of the former Granada nobility tried an intermediate way issuing the Lead Books of Sacromonte, purported paleo- Christian documents establishing a view of Christianity more acceptable to former Muslims. However, the Christianity of Moriscos and their fidelity to the Spanish kingdoms was doubted. The rules of cleanliness of blood treated them as second-class subjects. The battles of Spain and Portugal against Barbary pirates and the Ottoman Empire inspired fear of a fifth column, resolving Philip III of Spain to expel the Moriscos in 1609. Even useful refugees like deposed prince Muley Xeque had to leave some years later. Reception of Islam in Early Modern England Portrait of Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, a Moorish ambassador to Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 The first English convert to Islam mentioned by name is John Nelson.[/religion/religions/islam/history/uk_1.shtml BBC] 16th century writer Richard Hakluyt claimed he was forced to convert, though he mentions in the same story other Englishmen who had converted willingly. :This king had a son which was a ruler in an island called Gerbi, whereunto arrived an English ship called the Green Dragon, of the which was master one M. Blonket, who, having a very unhappy boy on that ship, and understanding that whosoever would turn Turk should be well entertained of the a yeoman of our Queen's guard, whom the king's son had enforced to turn Turk; his name was John Nelson.Voyager's Tales, 3, The voyage made to Tripolis in Barbary,1584, Richard Haklyut Captain John Ward of Kent was one of a number of British sailors who became pirates based in the Maghreb who also converted to Islam (see also Barbary pirates). Later, some Unitarians became interested in the faith, and Henry Stubbe wrote so favourably about Islam that it is thought he too had converted to the faith. From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 ships to Barbary pirates, who sold the passengers into slavery in North Africa.Rees Davies, British Slaves on the Barbary Coast, BBC, 1 July 2003 In 1625, it was reported that Lundy, an island in the Bristol Channel which had been a pirate lair for much of the previous half century, had been occupied by three Ottoman pirates who were threatening to burn Ilfracombe; Algerine rovers were using the island as a base in 1635, although the island had itself been attacked and plundered by a Spanish raid in 1633.History of Lundy In 1627, Barbary pirates under command of the Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon operating from the Moroccan port of Sal√© occupied Lundy. During this time there were reports of captured slaves being sent to Algiers and of the Islamic flag flying over Lundy. Ottoman presence in the Balkans The Ottoman Empire emerged in 1299 and lasted until 1919. The Ottomans were strong proponents of Sunni Islam.Everett Jenkins, Jr., The Muslim Diaspora: a Comprehensive Reference to the Spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. (Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Company, Inc., 2000), 2:7. In the 13th century, the kingdom was only in a small portion of northwest Anatolia but by the 16th century, it expanded to the heartland of the Byzantine Empire and its capital, Constantinople. The height of the Ottoman Empire occurred under the sultans Selim the Grim, also known as Selim I (1512‚Äì1520) and Suleyman the Magnificent (1520‚Äì1566). Under their reigns, the Turks conquered Egypt, Syria, and the North coast of Africa, the Red Sea, the island of Rhodes, and the Balkans all the way to the Great Hungarian Plain. Many members of Kosovo‚Äôs higher class, such as the Serbs and the Vlachs, converted to Islam during the Du≈°an period (1331‚Äì1355). A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. As a result, Kosovo‚Äôs three largest towns were majority Muslim by 1485, where Christians had once formed a dense population before the rise of the Ottoman Empire. The movement was effective due to the wandering of Sufis who traveled around the region teaching religion as they went. By the 16th century, towns like Prizren, Skopje, and ƒêakovica had established centers of learning that became crucial in inspiring and educating scholars who would then use their knowledge to benefit the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim world. From this time onward, many books circulated in the region that had a Persian influence while written in the Albanian language and Arabic alphabet. The oldest genre in this style is known as Bejtexhinji poetry.Isa Blumi. ‚ÄúKosovo.‚Äù The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Edited by John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article. (accessed January 29, 2008) Slavery Slavery at the time of the European Renaissance was a socio- economic factor especially around the Mediterranean Sea region. It was accepted and approved for both Muslims and Christians. Most slaves came from warfare, privateering, or the international slave trade. Only some of the Arabian slaves in Europe were Muslims by origin.P.S. Konningsveld, P.S., page15. Many of the Muslim slaves were baptized before they were sold for the first time and then were given a new Christian name. There were, however, some Muslims who were not baptized and who kept their original names, but if they had children the newborns were immediately baptized. Most Muslim slaves converted to Christianity because there was hard social pressure at the time for them to convert. They also improved their social position by converting to Christianity, such as they would rise from a slave to a serf.P.S. Konningsveld, page16. There were a small percentage of learned Muslim captives who were among the intellectual elite in their original hometowns among the Muslim prisoners and slaves. Captured Muslim scientists, physicians, and copyists were in high demand at slave markets. Learned Muslim captives were held in high regard by the authorities and they were sold for very high prices. They were wanted for the knowledge and advancements the Arabs had made over the Europeans. Copyists of Arabic manuscripts were needed in Spain to translate Arabic texts for the practice of medicine, the study of Arabic philosophy, and because of the popular interest in Europe for the translations of Arabic scientific texts. Learned Muslim captives played a very important role in the spread of Arabic science and philosophy over the Christian world.P.S. Konningsveld, page10. The liberation of Muslim slaves was a state affair and elevated the popular esteem of the sovereign government. Muslim slaves were either freed or exchanged through special legislation and international treaties.P.S. Konningsveld, page6. =Examples of learned Muslim captives= Portrait assumed to be of Leo Africanus (Sebastiano del Piombo, around 1520) One account of a highly esteemed Muslim slave is of Moroccan geographer al-Hassan al-Wazzan al-Fasi, who made important contributions to geography and Italian texts. In 1519, al-Fasi was captured by a group of Sicilian pirates while he was on his way home from Egypt. When he was picked up he had scholarly notes on him that he had made from his travels through Africa. The pirates soon realized his value and they gave him to Pope Leo X in Rome. Al-Fasi was baptized on June 6, 1520, and renamed Joannis Leo, but he became known as Leo the African or Leo Africanus. Leo Africanus learned Italian, taught in Barcelona, and made Arabic notes in a book called Description of Africa, which was used for many years as an important source of geographic information on Muslim Africa. =Barbary pirates= The Barbary States, who were allies of the Ottoman Empire, sent Barbary pirates to raid parts of Western Europe in order to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in the Arab World throughout the Renaissance period. Contemporaneous accounts suggest that a population of about 35,000 European slaves was maintained on the Barbary Coast. One writer estimates, on the basis that about 8,500 fresh slaves per annum would be required to maintain such a population, that as many as 1.25 million Europeans may have been taken in the 250 years to 1780, though there are no records to confirm such numbers. The slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and from farther places like France or England, the Netherlands, Ireland and even Iceland and North America, ultimately provoking the First Barbary War of the newly-formed United States. Early Modern Orientalism Following the first wave of Arabic interest during the Renaissance of the 12th century, which saw numerous Arabic texts being translated into Latin, there was a 'second wave' of interest in the study of Arabic literature, Arabic science and Islamic philosophy in 16th-century France and 17th-century England. Arabic astronomical manuscript of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, annotated by Guillaume Postel. Together with the development of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, cultural and scientific exchanges between France and the Ottoman Empire flourished. French scholars such as Guillaume Postel or Pierre Belon were able to travel to Asia Minor and the Middle East to collect information.Ecouen Museum exhibit Coran, copied circa 1536, bound according to regulations set under Francis I circa 1549, with arms of Henri II. Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. Scientific exchange is thought to have occurred, as numerous works in Arabic, especially pertaining to astronomy were brought back, annotated and studied by scholars such as Guillaume Postel. Transmission of scientific knowledge, such as the Tusi-couple, may have occurred on such occasions, at the time when Copernicus was establishing his own astronomical theories.Whose Science is Arabic Science in Renaissance Europe? by George Saliba Columbia University Books, such as the Coran, were brought back to be integrated in Royal libraries, such as the Biblioth√®que Royale de Fontainebleau, to create a foundation for the Coll√®ge des lecteurs royaux, future Coll√®ge de France. French novels and tragedies were written with the Ottoman Empire as a theme or background. In 1561, Gabriel Bounin published La Soltane, a tragedy highlighting the role of Roxelane in the 1553 execution of Mustapha, the elder son of Suleiman.Arthur Augustus Tilley, The Literature of the French Renaissance, p. 87 This tragedy marks the first time the Ottomans were introduced on stage in France.The Penny cyclop√¶dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge p.418 Arabic manuscripts were considered the key to a 'treasure house' of ancient knowledge, which led to the founding of Arabic Chairs at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, where Arabic was taught. A large collection of Arabic manuscripts were acquired, collected in places such as the Bodleian Library at Oxford. These Arabic manuscripts were sought after by natural philosophers for their research in subjects such as mathematics and observational astronomy, and also encompassed subjects ranging from science, religion, and medicine, to typography and garden plants. Besides scientific and philosophical literature, works of Arabic fiction were also translated into Latin and English during the 17th and 18th centuries. The most famous one was the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), which was first translated into English in 1706 and has since then had a profound influence on English literature. Another famous work was Ibn Tufail's philosophical novelJon Mcginnis, Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources, p. 284, Hackett Publishing Company, .Samar Attar, The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought, Lexington Books, . Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, which was translated into Latin as Philosophus Autodidactus by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671 and then into English by Simon Ockley in 1708. The English translation of Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, set on a desert island, may have inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, considered the first novel in English, in 1719.Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature, Al-Rashid House for Publication.Cyril Glasse (2001), New Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 202, Rowman Altamira, .Amber Haque (2004), \\"Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists\\", Journal of Religion and Health 43 (4): 357-377 [369].Martin Wainwright, Desert island scripts, The Guardian, 22 March 2003. Later translated literary works include Layla and Majnun and Ibn al-Nafis' Theologus Autodidactus. The Muslim Moors had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William Shakespeare. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's The Battle of Alcazar and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Titus Andronicus and Othello, which featured a Moorish Othello as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan England around 1600.Professor Nabil Matar (April 2004), Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Stage Moor, Sam Wanamaker Fellowship Lecture, Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe Theatre (cf. Mayor of London (2006), Muslims in London, pp. 14-15, Greater London Authority) A portrait was painted of one of the Moorish ambassadors, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, who had come to promote an Anglo-Moroccan alliance. At the Bodleian Library of Oxford University, there were hundreds of Arabic manuscripts, as well as dozens of Persian and Turkish ones, available during the 17th century. These included works on Islamic law and Arabic grammar; the lexicography of Al-Firuzabadi and Al-Jawhari; works on Arabic poetry; the Indian literary work Kalila and Dimna; the proverbs of Al-Maydani and Maqama of Al-Hariri of Basra; the medical works of Al-Razi, Avicenna, Ibn al-Baitar, Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Al-Majusi, Ibn al- Jazzar, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Ibn Zuhr, Maimonides and Ibn al-Nafis; the astronomical works of Ibn al-Banna, Ibn al-Shatir, Al-Farghani and Alhazen; the Masudic Canon by Abu Rayhan Biruni and the Book of Fixed Stars by Al-Sufi; several Ottoman scientific works by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf; occult and alchemical works; the Secretum Secretorum; Al-Safadi's biographical dictionary Al-Sihah; the historical works of Al-Tabari, Al-Isfahani, Al-Makin, Ibn Khallikan, Al-Dhahabi, Al-Waqidi, Ibn al-Shina, Al-Utbi, Ibn al-Jawzi, Ibn al-Athir, Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, Ibn Abi Usaibia, Bar-Hebraeus, Al-Tunaynai, Ibn Duqmaq, Ibn Taghribirdi, Al-Suyuti, Al-Jannabi, Ibn Hayyan, Ibn Miskawayh, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani and Al-Maqrizi; the History of Time by Al-Masudi and volume five of Ibn Khaldun's historiographical work Kitab al-Ibar; the historical and geographical works of Abu al-Fida; the Sahih al-Bukhari and Qur'anic commentaries; the Algebra by Al-Khwarizmi and the mathematical works of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi; the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity and Avienna's The Book of Healing; the works of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail; geographical works of Ibn Khordadbeh and Ibn Hawqal; . A Latin translation of two of Ali Qushji's works, the Tract on Arithmetic and Tract on Astronomy, was published by John Greaves in 1650.G. A. Russell, The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-century England, BRILL, 1994, , p. 162 =The turban in art and politics= Suleiman the Magnificent appears at the table in the 1563 The Wedding at Cana by Paolo Veronese. The turban often represented Muslims in the paintings of Italian and Flemish artists when they depicted scenes of the Ottoman Empire and Biblical lore. Famous figures such as Suleyman the Magnificent, Hagar, and Hayreddin Barbarossa appear in these paintings. The tradition of depicting Biblical characters in turbans has continued through to this century, as at least one of the wise men is always depicted with a turban.Nabil I. Matar, ‚ÄúRenaissance England and the Turban,‚Äù Images of the Other: Europe and the Muslim World Before 1700 Ed. David Blanks, (Cairo: Cairo Press, 1997). Turban iconography was highly prominent, especially in Renaissance England. While friendly relations were formed between England and the Islamic civilization of the Middle East in the early 16th century, Turkish fashions became popular for the higher classes. During times of interaction with Istanbul, Queen Elizabeth I of England wore Turkish clothing styles. It was believed that she favored working with the Islamic sultans of Istanbul rather than the Roman Catholic leaders of Europe. These suspicions were heightened when she asked Sultan Murad III and his son Mohammad III for military assistance. Although she never did receive any assistance from the sultans, her relations with the Sultan and his son did not waver.Nabil I. Matar, ‚ÄúRenaissance England and the Turban.‚Äù =Views on Muslim women= Alexander Ross, a writer and controversialist living in the first half of the 17th century, praised the Turks for being ‚Äúmore modest in their conversation generally than we; Men and Women converse not together promiscuously, as among us.‚ÄùNabil Matar, ‚ÄúThe Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,‚Äù page 51. Ross believed that England could learn a great deal from the Muslims. During the Renaissance, English women disrespected their husbands because they were free to do what they wanted, which society believed led to a moral deterioration.Nabil Matar, ‚ÄúThe Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,‚Äù page 52. European women also began leaving home to become male-like figures in society. Other European women attacked male chauvinism and defended the status of women by handing out pamphlets. Women rebelled against male religious hierarchy and began to replace men as preachers and pastors.Nabil Matar, ‚ÄúThe Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,‚Äù page 61. Christian writers highly admired Muslim women because they were frugal compared to English women, they were respected by their husbands because they did not play ‚Äúfalse‚Äù with them, and because Muslim women went immediately back to work after giving birth and they still had time to raise their children themselves, unlike English women.Nabil Matar, ‚ÄúThe Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,‚Äù page 53 and 54. The Muslim model became an example of the ‚Äúexotic‚Äù and ‚ÄúUtopian‚Äù ideal because it was not possible in European society.Nabil Matar, ‚ÄúThe Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,‚Äù page 60. European men sought to reinforce the traditional role of women and wanted their women to adhere to the model of Muslim women as frugal, obedient, wearing modest apparel, and respectful towards their husbands. Muslims and Englishmen differed in various ways, especially in their religious beliefs and militarism, but they did agree with each other on the representation of Muslim women.

The Turin Erotic Papyrus depicts women, possibly prostitutes, engaged in sexual acts with men. Permanent body adornment such as tattoos, appearing as dotted diamond shapes on the thighs of figurines and mummies, or as images of the god Bes, are seen on depictions of professional entertainers and prostitutes. Strabo, writing about Roman Egypt, recounts that daughters of noble families could be given into the service of the god Amun or Zeus; she was said to become a prostitute, engaging in sex with whomever she likes, until the onset of menstruation. =Roman occupation= As in the rest of the Roman Empire, prostitution was regulated. Prostitutes had to be registeredEdwards, \\"Unspeakable Professions,\\" p. 81. and taxes were collected from them. =Middle Ages= Prostitution was generally tolerated and taxed during this period, the rulers taking the view that prohibition would not stop prostitution and that tax revenue would be lost. There were periods when prostitution was prohibited following pressure on the rulers from Muslim clerics. =Ottoman rule= Under Ottoman rule, the regulation and taxation of prostitutes continued. During the 17th century two guilds for prostitutes were set up. =French occupation= Prostitution flourished following the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. The French organised additional prostitutes brought over from Europe. STIs spread rapidly through the brothels and this prompted the French authorities to introduce a law forbidding French troops from entering a brothel or having prostitutes in their rooms. Offenders received a death penalty. =Rule of Muhammad Ali= In 1834 Muhammad Ali Pasha outlawed prostitution and female public dancing in Cairo. The prostitutes and dancers were sent to Upper Egypt, especially Kena, Esna and Aswan. In 1837 he extended this to all of Egypt. Article 240 of the Mixed Penal Code of 1867 states: A pimp who incites young men or women below the age of 21 to evil practices leading to rape is to be punished by a period of imprisonment not less than one month and not more than one year. Article 241 increases the penalty if the offence is committed by the father, mother or guardian of a minor. Following the abolition of slavery in 1877, many recently freed female slaves turned to prostitution to survive. =British occupation= 1885 prostitute license issued in the Cairo municipality After the British occupation of 1882, the authorities were concerned about disease spreading amongst the troops. They made legal provisions to control prostitution and introduced a system of healthcare. In July 1885 Egypt's Ministry of the Interior introduced regulations for the health inspection of prostitutes. Further regulations were introduced in 1896 to control brothels. Australian soldiers stationed in Egypt in World War I including the famous half Chinese Australian sniper Billy Sing were major customers of Egyptian prostitutes in the local red light districts and brothels. High prices by the prostitutes led to the Wasser red light area becoming the scene of a major riot by New Zealand and Australian soldiers on Good Friday in 1915. The Australian military arranged for medical treatment for venereal diseases among its soldiers in Port Said and Cairo. In 1932 a Cabinet decree abolished licences for prostitution and established the \\"Public Morals Police\\". A new penal code was introduced in 1937 and included a section to punish men who lived off the earnings of prostitutes. In 1949 Military Order no. 76 was issued abolishing brothels. Law No. 68, introduced in 1951, penalizing: * Acts of prostitution if carried out habitually * Acts of prostitution whether carried out by males or females. (The term prostitution was used in regard to females; for males the term used was licentiousness.) * Acts inciting others to engage in prostitution * International trading of prostitutes (white slave trade) * The provision of housing or other premises where prostitutes can carry on their trade * The advertisement of prostitution whether in an open or disguised way.  The prostitution system  The prostitution system in Egypt often depends on pimping, although women also work alone. Pimps in Egypt organize the work of a group of prostitutes and receive a percentage of their profits. This is called the network in Egypt. This system is mainly used in Cairo and Alexandria and other big cities. Nikah mut‚Äòah Nikah mut‚Äòah is a temporary marriage allowed under Shia Islam Law. The 'marriage' may last for a term of one hour to one year. It is sometimes used to circumvent the prostitution laws. =Summer marriages= Wealthy men from the Gulf states often holiday in Egypt in the summer months. Whilst there they may take a young, temporary bride (often under-age) in a so- called summer marriage. The marriages are arranged through a marriage broker and the girl's parents receive gifts and money as a 'dowry'. The marriage ends when the men return to their own country.  Prostitution in the economy  As prostitution is illegal in Egypt, no taxes are paid. The law exposes people who practice adultery to a jail sentence up to six months. For prostitution, the sentence is up to 3 years. Sex trafficking Egypt is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Egyptian children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Individuals from the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait purchase Egyptian women and girls for \\"temporary\\" or \\"summer\\" marriages for the purpose of commercial sex, including cases of sex trafficking; these arrangements are often facilitated by the victims' parents and marriage brokers, who profit from the transaction. Child sex tourism occurs primarily in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor. Women and girls, including refugees and migrants, from Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East endure sex trafficking in Egypt. Syrian refugees who have settled in Egypt remain increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, including sex trafficking, and transactional marriages of girls‚Äîwhich can lead to sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking, The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Egypt as a 'Tier 2' country.

Thompson holds over twenty patents, most of which have been brought into production. He is best known for his staggered seating design which increases comfort and aircraft capacity. Background Thompson lives in the small coastal town of Kilkeel in County Down. He is founder of Thompson Aero Seating (formerly Thompson Solutions), which specialises in the design and engineering of aircraft seating. He retired in March 2014 after selling all his shares in Thompson Aero Seating. Work In 2003 Thompson began developing a lie flat business class seat called Vantage which is a fully horizontal flat bed. This design offers no loss of seats compared to the old \\"lie flat at an angle\\" style seating. The seating layout, also known as the Thompson Vantage configuration, is staggered, row by row, and implements a wide console which is the footwell for the passenger behind. In February 2008, Delta Air Lines announced that they would be installing the Vantage sleeper suite product designed by Thompson on their 767-400ER aircraft, engineered and manufactured by Contour Premium Aircraft Seating in a multi-million pound deal with Thompson Aero Seating. Delta later announced that they would also install the Vantage on their 767-300ER fleet, which is scheduled for completion in 2013. More recently Thompson Aero Seating secured deals for the Vantage seat with some of the world's largest airlines on various aircraft types, including Qantas (A330), American Airlines (B767), Air Canada (B777) and Etihad Airways. Thompson's long-awaited Cozy Suite has passed its 16G H.I.C. Development Test and after having conducted a number of customer comfort trials, Cozy Suite has been ready to enter service in 2011 although no airlines have purchased the seat to date leading to the company ceasing development of the seat type.Cozy Suite ready to fly in 2011 The Cozy Suite economy seat offers a distinct horizontally stepped seating layout which eases egress, provides a shoulder width as wide as business class, a dedicated sleeping area and more legroom.Cozy Suite In March 2014 Thompson sold all his shares in Thompson Aero Seating and left the company.

This marked the end of Eastern Roman maritime power over (and financial dominance of) the Eastern Mediterranean and thus brought about a decisive geopolitical shift, also spreading the Rashidun's control further. Historical overview With the death of Muhammad in 632 AD, the Muslim world began a period of rapid expansion. Under the rule of the first caliphs, the Rashidun, Muslim armies began assaulting the borders of both Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire.James Lindsay. Daily Life in The Medieval Islamic World. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press,1957) Pg 3 Neither of the two former powers was prepared for the aggressive expansion of the Arabs, as both largely underestimated Islam and its growing support; this is best depicted by the ambivalent views held by the Byzantines and the painstakingly slow reaction of the Sassanids.Khalil I. Semaan. Islam and the Medieval West. (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1980) Pg 4 After smashing both the Byzantines at Yarmuk (636) and the Persians at Qadisiyah (637), Muslim expansion set its sights south towards the rich provinces of Byzantine Africa. Following Muslim conquest, the local populace and political infrastructure was left largely intact, albeit under Muslim control. Some groups were persecuted, namely anyone deemed to be \\"pagan\\" or an \\"idolater\\". The Muslim people were tolerant of the Jews and Christians of captured regions. Many rose to positions of relative power and affluence in the new cities like Baghdad.Bat Ye‚Äôor. The Dhimmi. (Cranberry NJ: Associated University Press, 1985) Pg 43 This led to a stable and smooth running empire. The only major difference in treatment between Muslims and non-Muslims was the taxation system. Non believers were obligated to pay to the local government, called the jizya, while Muslims had to pay a ZakƒÅt. Due to paying jizya by the non-believers, it becomes the mandatory responsibility to the Muslim ruler to protect their (non-believers) life and wealth. This jizya also as for the non-believers, who do not participate the war conducted by the Muslim government. jizya is not applicable for old persons, women and children only for the capable persons who are able to participate in war willingly not want to do so. Byzantine Alexandria The rulers of Alexandria before the arrival of Islam were the Byzantines. A heavily trafficked port city, Alexandria was crucial to maintaining imperial control over the region, based on its large Greco- Egyptian population and economic importance. The population of Alexandria was heavily influenced by both the cultural and religious views of their Eastern Roman Empire rulers; nevertheless, the majority of the population spoke Coptic, rather than Latin or Greek. Thus, the main agents of cultural diffusion at the time of the arrival of Islam were the Coptic Christians led by Cyrus of Alexandria.Khalil I. Semaan. Islam and the Medieval West. The Byzantines relied on Egypt as the main center of food production for wheat and other foodstuffs. Alexandria also functioned as one of Byzantium‚Äôs primary army and naval bases, as there was normally a significant imperial garrison stationed in the city.Phillip K. Hitti. Capital Cities of Arab Islam. (Minneapolis: Jones Press, 1973) Pg 110 Though with the loss of Jerusalem in 638, much of Byzantine attention was drawn towards strengthening their hold on the frontier, chiefly in Anatolia and Egypt. Even though they would be able to successfully hold Asia Minor and retain it as an imperial base province, as time went on, Egypt became increasingly difficult to defend.  Rashidun conquest of Egypt  In 634, the Muslim leader Umar ascended to the role of caliph and inherited a heterogeneous and rapidly expanding Islamic empire. Throughout the early 640s, he set his sights on the economically desirable province of Egypt and its capital city of Alexandria. The Muslim invasion of Egypt was led by the commander Amr ibn Al-Aas, who commanded a force larger than any army that the Byzantines could field at the time, as a result of their crushing defeat at Yarmuk four years earlier. The original attempts by the Arab forces were not directed solely towards Alexandria, but rather at removing the Byzantine fortress of Babylon (Siege of Babylon Fortress) on the Nile Delta.James Lindsay. Daily Life in The Medieval Islamic World. The destruction of the Byzantine military power at the ensuing battle of Heliopolis, also known as Ain Shams, in the summer of 640 and the victory over the Byzantine defenders at Babylon effectively broke Byzantine power in Egypt. =Fall of Alexandria and aftermath= Following the destruction of the Byzantine forces at Heliopolis, the city of Alexandria was left virtually defenseless and it is likely that only a fraction of provincial forces remained garrisoned in the city itself. Though the Byzantines were unable to field an effective force, Alexandria's substantial fortifications, especially wall-mounted artillery, proved to be valuable assets and were adequate in keeping the Muslim attackers from mounting large attacks. However, in September 641, after a six-month siege, a day of ferocious attack commenced by 'Ubadah ibn as-Samit, reinforcement commander who just arrived from Medina crushed the Byzantine last defense. 'Ubadah strategy Shortly after, 'Ubadah lead a detachment to launch attack to Alexandria on the same day. 'Ubadah employed extremely ingenious strategies. He first dug deep trenches and hid important portions of his troops inside. This was done without being acknowledged by Byzantine defenders in Alexandria, so it was likely accomplished before the battle happened. The trenches were described as being deep enough to entirely hide a horse. As soon he and his main force has arrived at the outskirts of Alexandria, 'Ubadah gave the signal to the entire army including those who hid in the trenches to launch a general assault. The powerful strike was said to successfully rout the Alexandrian garrison forces on the very first charge. Alexandria capitulation After the conquest completed, 'Ubadah stay in Egypt for while assisting 'Amr to built Fustat city and its landmark, Mosque Amr ibn al-Aas. A treaty to evacuate the Byzantine garrison from the city and Babylon fortress was signed on November 8, 641. The \\"Treaty of Alexandria\\", recorded by John of Nikiu, included: # Payment of a fixed tribute by all who came under the treaty. # An armistice of about eleven months, to expire the first day of the Coptic month Paophi, i.e. September 28, 642. # During the armistice the Arab forces to maintain their positions, but to keep apart and undertake no military operations against Alexandria; the Roman forces to cease all acts of hostility. # The garrison of Alexandria and all troops there to embark and depart by sea, carrying all their possessions and treasure with them: but any Roman soldiers quitting Egypt by land to be subject to a monthly tribute on their journey. # No Roman army to return or attempt the recovery of Egypt. # The Muslims to desist from all seizure of churches, and not to interfere in any way with the Christians. # The Jews to be suffered to remain at Alexandria. # Hostages to be given by the Romans, viz. 150 military and 50 civilian, for the due execution of the treaty. The impact of such a major event as the loss of Alexandria to Muslim forces was felt throughout the Mediterranean world. The decrease in the annual grain shipments from Egypt struck a decisive blow to the Byzantine economy; besides the simple fact of fewer available resources, the empire lost untold thousands in taxes from the grain merchants now traveling southward towards Damascus and Alexandria. In such a weakened condition, the empire was barely able to bail itself out financially and, in some instances, had to resort to piracy, attacking merchant ships and ‚Äúrequisitioning‚Äù their cargo before distributing it to Byzantine or allied ports.Khalil I. Semaan. Islam and the Medieval West. Historically, Alexandria had provided Byzantium with a steady income of both money and luxury items, though some scholars speculate that the imposition of especially high taxes in the final decades of Byzantine rule may have been a considerable factor in causing a sizeable amount of the city‚Äôs population to defect from Byzantine stewardship to side with the Muslim invaders.‚ÄúThe Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu.‚Äù (The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu. English Translation, 2002 accessed 8 February 2008) from http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm =Byzantine counterattack= There were several Byzantine attempts to retake Alexandria. Though none of these were successful for a sustained period of time, Byzantine forces were able to briefly regain control of the city in 645. Arab chroniclers tell of a massive fleet and army sent by the Byzantines with the goal of retaking Alexandria. The imperial forces were led by a lower ranking imperial official named Manuel. After entering the city without facing much resistance, the Byzantines were able to regain control of both Alexandria and the surrounding Egyptian countryside. The Muslims retaliated by readying a large force of 15,000 who promptly set out to retake the city under command of the veteran Amr ibn Al-As. The Byzantines, following their standard tactical doctrine, advanced out of the city and sought an open battle away from the shelter of their fortifications. Accounts of the battle portray the Muslim forces as relying heavily on their archers before eventually assaulting the Byzantine positions, driving many back and routing the rest in the process. After this, the Byzantines were utterly defeated and withdrew from the region. In 654, yet another attempt to bring Alexandria back into imperial hands failed when an invasion force sent by Constans II was repulsed. This generally marks the end of Byzantine attempts to retake the city.  Life under Rashidun rule  In regards to the treatment of the native population, many sources point out visible persecution towards the native Coptic Christian population in Alexandria, a \\"religious tax\\" was imposed on any Dhimmis (un-converted) Egyptian. The protection of the Dhimmis (unconverted) was guaranteed in return for a payment of Jizyah (poll tax) of supposedly fixed taxes, which were embodied in the terms of the capitulation, at two dinars per adult male, and an additional kharaj (land tax) payable by those (including churches) possessing land in the provinces. In addition, the protected population was required to provide a measure of clothing and hospitality to any itinerant Muslim. This description is vague enough to cover the innumerable variations of interpretation offered by Arab chroniclers, jurists, and writers on taxation, to say nothing of many of their modern successors concerning the imposition of these taxes. Much of this confused material reflects the theoretical variations of a later date. Nevertheless, contemporary papyri as well as some historical sources show clearly that the Dhimmis in early Muslim Egypt were, in fact, the victims not so much of a system fixed ab origine by the capitulation but of frequent and seemingly haphazard changes in status and in levels and incidence of taxation. ‚Äù‚Äúhttp://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/cce/id/183/rec/6 In a later section, LeBon further explains, ‚ÄúThe lack of mercy and tolerance of the conquerors were among the reasons for the spread of their conquests and for the nations‚Äô The imposition of their faith and regulations and language, which became deeply rooted. Egypt is the most evident proof of this. It adopted what the Arabs had brought over, and reserved it. Thus the majority of the population of Alexandria where ready to resist Amr, although the Copts wanted peace, but where denied this by 'Amr.‚Äù‚Äúavailable from http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/642Egypt-conq2.asp#The History of The Patriarchs of Alexandria 'Amr kept his way until he arrived in Alexandria whose inhabitants he found ready to resist him, but the Copts in it preferred peace. Al-Mukaukis, Patriarch of Alexandria, communicated with 'Amr and asked him for peace and a truce for a time; but 'Amr refused. ‚Äù Al-Mukaukis then ordered that the women stand on the wall with their faces turned towards the city, and that the men stand armed, with their faces towards the Moslems, thus hoping to scare them. 'Amr sent word, saying, \\"We see what you have done. It was not by mere numbers that we conquered those we have conquered. We have met your king Heraclius, and there befell him what has befallen him.\\" Hearing this, al-Mukaukis said to his followers, \\"These people are telling the truth. They have chased our king from his kingdom as far as Constantinople. It is much more preferable, therefore, that we submit.\\" His followers, however, spoke harshly to him and insisted on fighting. The Moslems fought fiercely against them and invested them for three months. At last, 'Amr reduced the city by the sword and plundered all that was in it, sparing its inhabitants of whom none was killed or taken captive. He reduced them to the position of dhimmis like the people of Alyunah. He communicated the news of the victory to 'Umar through Mu'awiyah ibn-Hudaij al-Kindi (later as-Sakuni) and sent with him the fifth. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd when [Amr] saw the patriarch, he received him with respect, and said to his companions and private friends: ‚ÄòVerily in all the lands of which we have taken possession hitherto I have never seen a man of God like this man. Then Amr turned to him, and said to him: ‚ÄòResume the government of all your churches and of your people, and administer their affairs. And if you will pray for me, that I may go to the West and to Pentapolis, and take possession of them, as I have of Egypt, and return to you in safety and speedily, I will do for you all that you shall ask of me.‚Äù Then the holy patriarch Benjamin prayed for Amr, and pronounced an eloquent discourse, which made Amr and those present with him marvel, and which contained words of exhortation and much profit for those that heard him; and he revealed certain matters to Amr, and departed from his presence honored and revered.\\"‚ÄúThe History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria‚Äù (The Internet Medieval Sourcebook,1998 accessed 10 February 2008) available from http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/642Egypt-conq2.html =Islamic influence= Culturally, the city continued to function much the way it had under Byzantine rule. Greek, Coptic, and Arabic were all spoken fluently throughout the city and documents continued to be published in Greek and Coptic for some time following the takeover. Coptic was also continued in the fields of medicine, mathematics, and alchemy, whose practices thrived under the budding advances of Islamic intellectualism. However, after the 11th century, Arabic replaced Greek and Coptic as the principal language of the city.‚ÄúCoptic Egypt: Background Information‚Äù (University College, London, 2003 accessed 13 February 2008) from http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/coptic.coptic.html In terms of religion, Alexandria was largely characterized by its heterogeneous makeup, both before and after the advent of Islam. Indeed, from the third century on, Alexandria served as a major base for both the practice of Monophysitism and Nestorianism, as well as a surprising number of other Christian sects that found refuge in Egypt. From a cultural perspective, the practice of marriage between Muslim men and non-Muslim women was a fairly common one, and at least a sizeable portion of the Muslim invasion force that settled in and around the city of Alexandria took native Egyptian women as their brides. As this was typically discouraged by the umma and prohibited by the reigning caliph Umar, this gives credence to the Islamic state's desire to respect the lives of the local population rather than act as agents of disorder.Kenneth W. Frank. 1993. ‚ÄúPirenne Again: A Muslim Viewpoint‚Äù. The History Teacher 23 (6): 371-383 The fall of Alexandria and the acquisition of the Byzantine Empire's oriental provinces of Egypt and Syria are generally seen as a critical step towards the culmination of uniquely Islamic identity. The importance of Alexandria as the staging point for future conquests and economic purposes should not be dismissed. It is accurate then to say that the loss of these provinces paved the way for the future Muslim conquest of the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa, which included key cities such as Cyrenaica (642), Tripoli (643), and Kairouan (670). Thus the fall of Alexandria accentuated a clearly defined geopolitical shift in influence from the regions of interior Arabia to those of the Mediterranean and in the ensuing centuries, the significance of these conquests would allow Egypt to become the seat of dominant Muslim law.

It is currently used by several countries for their national geodetic surveys, but will be replaced in the next decades by modern ellipsoids of satellite geodesy. The Bessel ellipsoid was derived in 1841 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, based on several meridian arcs and other data of continental geodetic networks of Europe, Russia and the British Survey of India. It is based on 10 meridional arcs and 38 precise measurements of the astro‚Äîgeographic latitude and longitude (see also astro geodesy). The dimensions of the ellipsoid axes were defined by logarithms in keeping with former calculation methods.  The Bessel and GPS ellipsoids  The Bessel ellipsoid fits especially well to the geoid curvature of Europe and Eurasia. Therefore it is optimal for National survey networks in these regions, despite of the fact that its axes are about 700 m shorter than that of the mean Earth ellipsoid derived by satellites. Below there are the two axes a, b and the flattening ∆í = (a ‚àí b)/a. For comparison, the data of the modern World Geodetic System WGS84 are shown, which is mainly used for modern surveys and the GPS system. * Bessel ellipsoid 1841 (defined by log a and ∆í): ** a = 6,377,397.155 m ** ∆í = 1 / 299.1528153513233 (0.003342 773154 ¬± 0.000005) ** b = 6,356,078.963 m. * Earth ellipsoid WGS84 (defined directly by a and ∆í): ** a = 6,378,137.0 m''' ** ∆í = 1 / 298.257223563 ** b = 6,356,752.30 m.  Usage  The ellipsoid data published by Bessel (1841) were then the best and most modern data mapping the Earth's figure. They were used by almost all national surveys. Some surveys in Asia switched to the Clarke ellipsoid of 1880. After the arrival of the geophysical reduction techniques many projects used other examples such as the Hayford ellipsoid of 1910 which was adopted in 1924 by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) as the International ellipsoid 1924. All of them are influenced by geophysical effects like vertical deflection, mean continental density, rock density and the distribution of network data. Every reference ellipsoid deviates from the worldwide data (e.g. of satellite geodesy) in the same way as the pioneering work of Bessel. In 1950 about 50% of the European triangulation networks and about 20% of other continents networks were based on the Bessel ellipsoid. In the following decades the American states switched mainly to the Hayford ellipsoid 1908 (\\"internat. Ell. 1924\\") which was also used for the European unification project ED50 sponsored by the United States after World War II. The Soviet Union forced its satellite states in Eastern Europe to use the Krasovsky ellipsoid of about 1940. As of 2010 the Bessel ellipsoid is the geodetic system for Germany, for Austria and the Czech Republic. It is also used partly in the successor states of Yugoslavia and some Asian countries: Sumatra and Borneo, Belitung, Okinawa (Japan). In Africa it is the geodetic system for Eritrea and Namibia.

Grant (AP-29) was a transport ship that saw service with the United States Navy in World War II. Originally a German ocean liner named Konig Wilhelm II, she was seized by the United States during the First World War and renamed USS Madawaska (ID-3011) in 1917 before being renamed USS U. S. Grant (AP-29) in 1922. World War I Konig Wilhelm II was a steel-hulled screw steamer launched on 20 July 1907 at Stettin, Germany, by Vulcan Aktiengesellschaft. Built for the transatlantic passenger trade, Konig Wilhelm II operated between Hamburg, Germany, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, under the house flag of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, until the outset of World War I in 1914. Voluntarily interned at Hoboken, New Jersey, to avoid being captured by the Royal Navy, the passenger liner was seized after the United States entered the war on 6 April 1917, as were all other German vessels in American ports. Before agents of the U.S. federal government took possession of the ship, her German crew unsuccessfully attempted to render her unusable by cracking her main steam cylinders with hydraulic jacks. Following repairs to the damaged machinery, Konig Wilhelm II was assigned the identification number 3011 and commissioned on 27 August 1917, Lt. Charles McCauley in temporary command pending the arrival of Comdr. Edward H. Watson. Renamed Madawaska on 1 September, the ship was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force of the Atlantic Fleet. During World War I, she conducted 10 transatlantic voyages in which she carried nearly 12,000 men to Europe. After the armistice of 11 November 1918, Madawaska made seven more voyages, bringing 17,000 men home from the European theater. She completed the last of these runs upon her arrival at New York on 23 August 1919. She was decommissioned by the Navy on 2 September and simultaneously transferred to the War Department. Between the wars Madawaska in 1920 Sailing for the Pacific soon thereafter, Madawaska embarked elements of the Czech Legion at Vladivostok, Russia, early in 1920, as part of the evacuation of that force in the wake of the Russian Civil War in Siberia. The ship sailed to Terst, Italy, and disembarked her Czech passengers to return to their homeland. Subsequently sailing for New York, Madawaska was inactivated and turned over to the US Shipping Board for lay-up. The following year, however, the War Department reacquired the vessel and authorized a major refit for her before she could resume active service. During this overhaul, which would last through the spring of 1922, the ship was fitted with modern marine watertube boilers for greater safety in operation and to enable the ship to make increased speed. On 3 June 1922, at Brooklyn, New York, the transport was renamed U. S. Grant; Princess Cantacuzene, wife of Major General Prince Cantacuzene, Count Speransky of Russia, and a granddaughter of General Ulysses S. Grant, christened the ship. For almost two decades, U. S. Grant soldiered on in the Army Transport Service, maintaining a regular schedule of voyages carrying troops, passengers, and supplies along a route which included calls at San Francisco, California; Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii; Guam; Manila, Philippines; Chinwangtao and Shanghai, China; the Panama Canal Zone, and New York. For many of these years of service in the Pacific, U. S. Grant served as the sole source of refrigerated stores from the United States. Her periodic arrivals at Apra Harbor invariably produced a temporary improvement in the diet of Americans living in Guam. =Run aground at Guam= On one voyage to Guam, the transport was nearly lost. On the late afternoon of 19 May 1939, U. S. Grant ran aground on the dangerous inner reef in the as-yet unfinished harbor. Fortunately, the accident did not occur during typhoon season. The combined efforts of minesweeper and oil depot ship failed to budge the ship off the coral, leading the Acting Governor of Guam, Comdr. George W. Johnson, to hit upon a plan of action in collaboration (by radio) with Capt. Richmond K. Turner, in heavy cruiser , which was then en route to the island. For 21 hours, members of the U.S. Naval Insular Force and local stevedores unloaded 300 tons of cargo from the grounded U. S. Grant, while much of her fuel was transferred to Robert L. Barnes and . Astoria - en route for the United States after carrying Japanese Ambassador Hiroshi Saito's ashes back to his homeland - arrived at 0630 on 21 May. She took up her assigned position, as did Penguin, Robert L. Barnes and Admiral Halstead; at 0809 U. S. Grant lurched free of the coral reef, to the accompaniment of cheers from the transport's crew. The island's newspaper, the Guam Recorder, subsequently reported in its June 1939 edition: \\"The short time in which the difficult operation was carried out was due to the efficient cooperation of all...involved, the Army, Navy, and Merchant Marine.\\" All cargo was soon reloaded, and U. S. Grant resumed her voyage. She continued under the aegis of the Army Transportation Service through 1940. Then as war clouds gathered in the Pacific and Atlantic, U. S. Grant was subsequently reacquired by the Navy. Armed with seven 3-inch guns (she had been unarmed while serving as an Army transport), the vessel was refitted at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, and was commissioned on 16 June 1941, Capt. Herbert R. Hein in command. Continuing her service as a transport, the ship received the classification of AP-29. World War II =Aleutian Islands= U. S. Grant operated between ports on the west coast and into the Aleutian Islands through the outbreak of war in the Pacific on 7 December 1941. She carried passengers and cargo to Alaskan ports as the United States built up its defenses in that area against possible thrusts by Japan. In February and March 1942, U. S. Grant conducted voyages to the Hawaiian Islands. During the former month, she returned some 1,000 enemy aliens (mostly Japanese with a sprinkling of Germans) for placement in internment camps in the southwestern United States. Among these passengers was prisoner of war number one, Lt. Kazuo Sakamaki, whose midget submarine had run aground off Barbers Point, Oahu, on 7 December 1941. In April, U. S. Grant resumed trips to Alaskan ports carrying troops from Seattle to American bases on the Alaskan mainland and in the Aleutians and continued this vital routine until the spring of 1942. The Battle of the Coral Sea during May 1942 convinced the Japanese that a thrust at Midway Island was imperative, in an attempt to draw out the American fleet - particularly the dwindling number of vital aircraft carriers. Consequently, a powerful Japanese fleet sailed for Midway, while a smaller task force headed northward for the Aleutians to launch a diversionary raid. Carrier-based planes from the carrier struck Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on 3 June, and Japanese troops occupied Attu and Kiska islands on the 7th. During this time, U. S. Grant carried troops to Kodiak, Alaska, and Cold Bay into the summer. She narrowly escaped being torpedoed while proceeding from Seattle to Dutch Harbor in convoy on 20 July. Alert lookouts picked out the tracks of two torpedoes and evasive action enabled the ship to avoid the deadly \\"fish\\" which passed close aboard, from starboard to port. The venerable transport disembarked Army troops at Massacre Bay on 14 June, three days after the initial landings. The following month, as American and Canadian troops prepared to assault Kiska, Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell broke his flag in U. S. Grant as Commander, Task Force 51. During this operation, U. S. Grant served as combination transport and communications vessel. The Americans eventually discovered that the Japanese had stolen away like nomads, leaving only a few dogs to \\"contest\\" the landings, and had completed their evacuation, undetected by the Allies, by 28 July. During the Kiska landings, the transport not only carried Army troops, but also a Mexican liaison group; a detachment of Canadian troops, and a group of civilian correspondents. After a period of repairs in late 1943, which lasted into 1944, U. S. Grant resumed coastwise voyages to Alaska. =Caribbean and Pacific service= From April to December, she shifted to the eastern Pacific to operate between Hawaii and the west coast. She often embarked medical patients to return them to the west coast from Hawaiian area hospitals. Arriving at San Francisco after one such voyage on 23 January 1945, U. S. Grant disembarked passengers and got underway the same afternoon without passengers or escort, bound for the Caribbean. Transiting the Panama Canal, after embarking passengers at Balboa, the ship operated in the Caribbean for the next six months, between the West Indies and New Orleans, Louisiana, until the end of the war. U. S. Grant returned to Pacific duty in September, departing San Francisco on the 18th for Okinawa, via Eniwetok. She arrived at Okinawa on 12 October, in the wake of a destructive typhoon, and took on board 1,273 passengers for transportation to the United States, getting underway from the island on 21 October. Arriving at San Francisco on 7 November, U. S. Grant disembarked her passengers soon thereafter. Decommission One week later, on 14 November, the transport was decommissioned and returned to the War Department. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 28 November. Turned over to the Maritime Commission, the erstwhile transport and veteran of two world wars was sold to the Boston Metals Company, on 24 February 1948 for scrapping. Awards U. S. Grant received one battle star for her World War II service. Footnotes References  AP-29 U. S. Grant, Navsource Online.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. and Description and history British General Charles Cornwallis, had encamped at Camden in the summer of 1780 to secure northern South Carolina against the threat of Continental Army forces in North Carolina. These forces, only recently placed under the command of General Horatio Gates, advanced to Rugeley's Mill, about north of Camden on August 15. Both commanders then ordered a night march to attack the other. These forces met in the dark at 2:00 AM on the morning of August 16. After a brief clash, both sides formed lines, and resumed the battle at daybreak. The battle was a rout, as the militia forces under Gates' command threw down their weapons and fled at the first gunfire, and his Continental forces were eventually surrounded and forced to surrender, with their commander, Baron Johann de Kalb suffering mortal injuries. The defeat marked a low point in the battle for American independence. The area where this battle took place is roughly defined by Gum Swamp Creek and another further to its east, both of which drain into Lake Shamokin to the north. This area is roughly bisected by Flat Rock Rd, along which a marker has been placed where Baron de Kalb fell. The battlefield area measures about east-west and north-south. The area is largely composed of grasslands and forest, much as it would have been at the time of the battle.

Its molecule can be described as that of sucrose with its eight hydroxyl groups ‚Äì replaced by acetate groups ‚Äì. It is a crystalline solid, colorless and odorless but intensely bitter. Sucrose octaacetate is used as an inert ingredient in pesticides and herbicides, as a bitter additive. History The preparation of sucrose octaacetate was first described in 1865 by P. Schutzenberger, but its purification and characterization were first published by A. Herzfeld in 1887. Preparation The compound can be prepared by the exothermic reaction of sucrose with acetic anhydride at about 145 ¬∞C, with sodium acetate as catalyst. The product can be purified by dissolution in ethanol and recrystallization. Properties =Structure= The structure of the crystallized form was determined by J. D. Oliver and L. C. Strickland in 1984, using X-ray diffraction. The crystal system is orthorombic, symmetry group P212121, with parameters a = 1.835 nm, b= 2.144 nm, c= 0.835 nm, Z=4, V=3.285 nm3, Dx = 1.372 g/mL. The pyranose and furanose rings are in \\"chair\\" (4C1) and \\"twist\\" (4T1) conformations, respectively, unlike their conformations in saccharose. =Physico-chemical= Sucrose octaacetate is only slightly soluble in water (sources give 0.25 to 1.4 g/L at room temperature) but is soluble in many common organic solvents such as toluene and ethanol, from which it can be crystallized by evaporation. It is also soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide. It is a neutral molecule with no ionizable hydrogen atoms. The compound melts into a viscous liquid (29.54 poises at 100.2 ¬∞C), that becomes a clear glassy solid on cooling. The density of the glassy form is 1.28 kg;L (at 20 ¬∞C), its index of refraction nD20 is 1.4660,its dielectric constant is 4.5 (at 1 kHz), and its resistivity is 1.5 √ó 1014 Œ© cm. It is optically active with [Œ±]D24 = +59.79¬∞. The compound slowly hydrolyzes in water: 0.25% of the acetate ester bonds were broken by boiling in water for 1 hour, and 0.20% after standing in water at 40¬∞ C for 5 days. Sucrose octaacetate decomposes at about 285 ¬∞C, but can be distilled at reduced pressure at 260¬∞ C. =Organoleptic= The compound is odorless but intensely bitter, being detectable at a concentration of 1‚Äì2 ppm. Adding 0.6 g of the compound to 1 kg of sugar renders it too bitter to eat. =Melting point and possible polymorphism= There has been significant discrepancy in the reported melting point of the crytalline compound. Five reports spanning 1880 to 1928 gave it as 69‚Äì70 ¬∞C. In 1930, a crystal form was reported to melt at 75 ¬∞C. In 1936, another report described a different crystal form and a melting point of 83 ¬∞C. In 1940, the same authors found 89 ¬∞C. All reports since then have given melting points in 83‚Äì89 ¬∞C range. It was conjectured that the differences could be due to polymorphism; namely, that the compound could crystallize in two or more different crystal structures, with different melting points. However, modern studies, including X-ray diffraction, failed to find any evidence of polymorphism. Reactions Sucrose octaacetate can be converted to other eightfold fatty acid esters of sucrose by reacting it with the appropriate triglyceride with sodium methoxide as catalyst. This way one can obtain sucrose octacaprylate (C8 chain), octacaprate (C10, m.p ‚àí24 ¬∞C) octalaurate (C12, 10 ¬∞C), octamyristate (C14, 34 ¬∞C), octapalmitate, (C16, 50.5 ¬∞C), octastearate (C18, 61 ¬∞C), octaoleate (C18 cis-9), octaelaidate (C18 trans-9, 7.4 ¬∞C), and octalinoleate (C18 cis-9,12). Applications =Bitterant= Sucrose octaacetate has been used to determine tasters from non-tasters in mice, in clinical drug studies and sweetener evaluations, and in taste physiology research. The product has also been used as a bitterant and aversive agent. Until 1993, the compound was the active ingredient of over-the-counter preparations to discourage thumb sucking and nail biting. It has also been used in sprays and lotions to prevent dog licking, and as an additive to deter ingestion of pesticides and other toxic products. =Flavoring agent= Sucrose octaacetate as a flavoring agent in foods and beverages, such as in bitters and ginger ale. =Plasticizer= Sucrose octaacetate has been used as an adhesive and as a plasticizer in lacquers and plastics. While the crystalline character of the pure compound is an obstacle for this latter application, mixed esters where some acetate groups are replaced by propionate or isobutyrate can be used. Safety Due to its low toxicity, sucrose octaacetate was authorized by the US Environment Protection Agency for use as an inert ingredient in pesticides, as food additive, and as a nail-biting and thumb-sucking deterrent in over-the-counter drug products.

His repertoire consisted mainly of Italian operatic works, with Rossini's Figaro and Verdi's Rigoletto becoming his signature roles during a long and distinguished career which stretched from 1899 to 1944.  Life and career  Born in Casalecchio di Reno near Bologna, Italy, Stracciari first sang in an operetta chorus during 1894. He then entered the Bologna Conservatory, undertaking vocal studies with Umberto Masetti. He made his professional debut in 1899, at the Teatro Communale in Bologna, in Pesori's sacred work La risurrezione di Christo. The following year he made his operatic debut as Marcello in Puccini's La boh√®me in Rovigo. After appearing in various Italian opera houses, he made his debut at Italy's leading operatic venue, La Scala, Milan, in 1904. Stracciari's career quickly became international, with debuts at the Royal Opera House in London in 1905, followed by his first appearance at the New York Metropolitan Opera on December 1, 1906, as Germont in La traviata with Marcella Sembrich and Enrico Caruso. During his two seasons at the Met, his roles included: Rigoletto, Ashton, Amonasro, N√©lusko, Valentin, Marcello, Sharpless, Lescaut, Alfio, Tonio, and Di Luna. He also appeared with the Chicago Opera, the San Francisco Opera, the Paris Op√©ra, the Teatro Real in Madrid and the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Stracciari performed widely, too, in his native Italy and retired from the stage in 1944. He is above all associated with Rossini's great comic creation Figaro, in Il barbiere di Siviglia, which he sang an estimated 1000 times, and Rigoletto, in Verdi's tragic opera of the same name. He made complete recordings of these two works in 1929, opposite Mercedes Capsir and Dino Borgioli. Both of these recordings are of particular historical value as illustrations of Italian singing styles of that period. Stracciari sang in an era that was rich in outstanding operatic voices. But despite the high quality of the competition which he faced from rival singers, he is still widely considered to have been one of the finest Italian baritones of the 20th century, owing to the beauty of his voice during its peak period, his imposing interpretive style and his first- rate vocal technique. America's foremost soprano of the post World War I-era, Rosa Ponselle, was an enthusiastic admirer of Stracciari's singing. He also became a distinguished teacher at the music conservatories of Naples and Rome. Among his most notable students were Raffaele Ari√©, Paolo Silveri, Giulio Fioravanti, Zdenƒõk Otava, Mario Laurenti, Louis Quilico and Boris Christoff. He died in Rome aged 80.  Recordings/Discography  In addition to the numerous recordings of duets and individual arias which Stracciari made for Fonotipia Records and Columbia Records before, during and after World War One, he participated in the production of two complete Columbia opera recordings which have been reissued, first on LP and then on CD.

The process as a whole has been referred to as the Texas Two-step, after the partner dance of the same name, because Texans were required to first vote in the primary election in order to be eligible for participation in party caucuses in which delegates were selected. The current process differs for Democrats and Republicans. The Republican Party of Texas has a winner-take-all provision in its primary, and the chances any candidate will get all of that party‚Äôs Texas delegates are very small. That candidate would have to win more than 50 percent of the vote statewide, and also in each of the state‚Äôs 36 congressional districts, to run the table. Absent such an event, a pro-rata system is followed to allocate delegates roughly according to votes received. The Texas Democratic Party no longer selects state delegates at caucuses. After the votes of Texans participating in the Democratic primary are counted, delegates are awarded among the candidates who received 15 percent or more of the vote, in proportion to the votes received by each.Nassar, George. \\"Texas Democratic Caucus FAQ.\\" The Texas Blue. 03/04/2008. http://www.thetexasblue.com/texas- democratic-caucus-faq It would be even harder for a Democrat than for a Republican to get all of the Texas delegates from their party in a presidential primary.

Controversies The Texas Democratic Party abandoned the former caucus-based \\"Texas Two-step\\" primary system in 2015. The Democratic County (Senate District) Conventions in late March 2008 produced a great deal of confusion. Both Clinton and Obama supporters had complaints about how these conventions were conducted. The most common complaint had to do with the fact that delegates were not being apportioned based on Precinct Convention results. For instance, in Kleberg County, 9 delegates were elected to attend the State Convention, with only one Obama supporter among them. Obama won about one third of the votes in the Precinct Caucuses/Conventions in Kleberg County.

Background Frances Wolseley was born in Pimlico, London, as the only child of Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1833‚Äì1913), later Baron Wolseley of Cairo and Viscount Wolseley, commander-in-chief of the British army, and his wife, Louisa Erskine (1843‚Äì1920). She was educated privately. She was also presented at court, but rejected marriage and the conventions of her upper-class background in favour of gardening education.BBC Radio Retrieved 27 December 2016. Gardening and writing The family settled at Trevor House, Glynde in 1899, where she was able to pursue her interest in gardening and other country pursuits. The gardening college she founded in 1902 moved five years later to a five-acre (2 ha) teaching garden outside the village, at Ragged Lands.Ragged Lands: 1905‚Äì2016 Retrieved 27 December 2016. Glynde College for Lady Gardeners offered two-year courses. These were featured in the magazine Country Life in November 1909. The College prospered until the end of the First World War, although it continued to operate until 1933. About 1907, Wolseley became less involved with day-to-day college management, in favour of promoting the idea of women being professionally involved with horticulture.Parks & Gardens UK Retrieved 27 December 2016. Her wider campaign in support of gardening led to a successful book, Gardening for Women (1908), which described ways women could support the rural economy through horticulture. She toured gardens and horticultural colleges in England, Canada and South Africa in that period. She was admitted into the Worshipful Company of Gardeners of the City of London in 1913. In the same year she inherited the viscountcy from her father (remainder by special arrangement) and then moved to Massetts Place near Lindfield, West Sussex with her mother. There Wolseley's most important book, Women on the Land (1916) was written. It covers organization of smallholdings and market cooperatives, women's institutes, and gardening as a subject for schools. Her other titles included In a College Garden (1916), which described the work of the College, and Gardens, their Form and Design (1919), which stimulated the emergence of landscape architecture as a discipline a decade later. She moved in 1920 to Culpepers, Ardingly, West Sussex. Her later works mainly covered local history. Bequest Viscountess Wolseley died on 24 December 1936 at Culpepers, Ardingly, Sussex, after a lengthy illness. She was buried at St Andrew's Church, Beddingham, East Sussex. She bequeathed her books and papers to Hove Corporation, along with funds to improve the library and set up a Wolseley Room. The material is retained among Hove Library's special collections. A biography describing her work appeared in 1939 by Marjory Pegram: The Wolseley Heritage: the Story of Frances Viscountess Wolseley and her Parents.

It consists of an electroless nickel plating covered with a thin layer of gold, which protects the nickel from oxidation. The gold is typically applied by quick immersion in a solution containing gold salts. Some of the nickel is oxidized to while the gold is reduced to metallic state. A variant of this process adds a thin layer of electroless palladium over the nickel, a process known by the acronym ENEPIG. Advantages and disadvantages ENIG and ENEPIG are meant to replace the more conventional coatings of solder, such as hot air solder leveling (HASL). While more expensive and require more processing steps, they have several advantages, including excellent surface planarity (important for ball grid array component mounting), good oxidation resistance, and suitability for movable contacts such as membrane switches and plug-in connectors. Early ENIG processes had poor adhesion to copper and lower solderabiliy than HASL. In addition, a non-conductive layer containing nickel and phosphorus, known as \\"black pad\\", could form over the coating due to sulfur-containing compounds from the solder mask leaching into the plating bath. Standards The quality and other aspects of ENIG coatings for PCBs are covered by IPC Standard 4552A, while IPC standard 7095D, about ball array connectors, covers some ENIG problems and their remediation.

This classic work about Voltaire was still being printed nearly 100 years later in 2003. Overview The book is in the form of an anecdotal biography telling the stories of ten men whose lives fell very closely together. The ten men were true contemporaries and aside from their friendship with Voltaire they were more or less closely associated with one another. Each of the ten is characterized by giving him an identifying label: d'Alembert the Thinker, Diderot the Talker, Galiani the Wit, Vauvenargues the Aphorist, d'Holbach the Host, Grimm the Journalist, Helv√©tius the Contradiction, Turgot the Statesman, Beaumarchais the Playwright, and Condorcet the Aristocrat. The chapter on Helv√©tius contains a famous quotation that was subsequently misattributed to Voltaire himself. While discussing the persecution of Helv√©tius for his book \\"On the Mind\\" (which was publicly burned), Hall wrote: The phrase \\"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\\", which was originally intended as a summary (by Hall) of Voltaire's attitude, was widely misread as a literal quotation from Voltaire.

It consists in dipping the object briefly into a solution containing silver ions. Immersion silver plating is used by the electronics industry in manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs), to protect copper conductors from oxidation and improve solderability. Advantages and disadvantages Immersion silver coatings have excellent surface planarity, compared more traditional coating processes such as hot air solder leveling (HASL). They also have low losses in high-frequency applications due to the skin effect. On the other hand, silver coatings will degrade over time due to oxidation or air contaminants such as sulfur compounds and chlorine. A problem peculiar to solver coatings is the formation of silver whiskers under electric fields, which may short out components  Specifications  IPC Standard: IPC-4553  See also  * Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) * Hot Air Solder Leveling (HASL) * Organic Solderability Preservative (OSP) * Reflow soldering * Wave soldering  References  Printed circuit board manufacturing ","title":"Immersion silver plating"},{"id":"16108858","text":"Ewo is a district in the Cuvette-Ouest Region of western Republic of the Congo.

While pitching for the last-place Boston Doves (later known as the Rustlers, and later still as the Braves) in 1910 and 1911, Curtis set a record of 23 consecutive losses. The record was eventually broken in 1993, when New York Mets pitcher Anthony Young lost 27 consecutive games in which he had a decision.

Buxtun, then a 27-year-old social worker and epidemiologist in San Francisco, was hired by the Public Health Service in December 1965 to interview patients with sexually transmitted diseases; in the course of his duties, he learned of the Tuskegee experiment from co-workers. He later said, \\"I didn't want to believe it. This was the Public Health Service. We didn't do things like that.\\" In November 1966, he filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the Service's Division of Venereal Diseases; this was rejected on the grounds that the experiment was not yet complete. He filed another protest in November 1968, seven months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., pointing out the political volatility of the study; again, his concerns were ruled irrelevant. In 1972, Buxtun leaked information on the Tuskegee experiment to Jean Heller of the Washington Star. Heller's story exposing the experiment was published on July 25, 1972; It became front-page news in The New York Times the following day. Senator Edward Kennedy called Congressional hearings, at which Buxtun and officials from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare testified. The experiment was terminated shortly afterwards. In May 1999, Buxtun attended the launch of a memorial center and public exhibit to the experiment in Tuskegee.

In later years, Nasser became a vocal critic of Sadat, and his presidential successor, Hosni Mubarak, both of whose policies had diverged significantly from those of Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Background Despite Zheng Yin's high status, little is firmly established about his career except for the 705 to 710 time period‚Äîas, unusual for a chancellor, he did not have a biography in either the Old Book of Tang or the New Book of Tang.See the Table of Contents for the Old Book of Tang and the Table of Contents for the New Book of Tang. It is known that he was not a member of the more prominent branches of the Zheng family that had served as officials since Northern Wei, but was from Cang Prefecture (ÊªÑÂ∑û, roughly modern Cangzhou, Hebei). His father Zheng Xuansheng (ÈÑ≠ÁéÑÊòá) served as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 75, part 1 He passed the imperial examinations. It was said that during the reign of Wu Zetian, Zheng Yin was an associate of her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong and had served as Dianzhong Shi Yushi (ÊÆø‰∏≠‰æçÂæ°Âè≤), a low level imperial censor. During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and her son and crown prince Li Xian, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were killed in the coup, and Zheng Yin, as their associate, was demoted to be publics works officer at Xuan Prefecture (ÂÆ£Â∑û, roughly modern Xuancheng, Anhui). Once there, he was accused of receiving bribes, and he fled and secretly returned to the eastern capital Luoyang. Once at Luoyang, he secretly met Emperor Zhongzong's cousin (Wu Zetian's nephew) Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang, who was then a trusted advisor of Emperor Zhongzong and a lover to Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei and was locked in a power struggle with the leaders of the coup that had returned Emperor Zhongzong to the throne -- Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji. When Zheng first saw Wu Sansi, he cried out loud, and then laughed out loud. Wu Sansi, who was stern in his disposition, was perplexed. Zheng responded: Wu Sansi was very happy and invited Zheng up a tower, to further discuss with Zheng the strategies he should take. He further recommended Zheng to serve as Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official that legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). Zheng thereafter served as chief strategist for Wu Sansi, along with Cui Shi. Soon, Wu Sansi and Empress Wei were able to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to remove the coup leaders from their chancellor posts under guise of honoring them with princely titles. In 706, in association with Wu Sansi, Zheng accused the coup leaders, by then all out of the capital Chang'an, of having conspired with Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (ÁéãÂêåÁöé), who was executed early in 706 for having planned to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei. The five coup leaders were demoted to be military advisors to prefects in distant prefecture. Wu Sansi then had accusations about his affair with Empress Wei publicly posted in Luoyang, hoping to incense Emperor Zhongzong and then blame the coup leaders. Zheng then accused the coup leaders of having posted the accusations and requested that their clans be slaughtered. Emperor Zhongzong denied the request, but exiled the coup leaders to even more distant prefectures, where they subsequently died or were killed on Wu Sansi's orders. In 707, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongjun the Crown Prince, angry that Empress Wei's daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle and her husband Wu Chongxun (Ê≠¶Â¥áË®ì, Wu Sansi's son) repeatedly humiliated him and were trying to have Li Guo'er made crown princess to displace him, rose in rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun, but subsequently was defeated and killed in exile. Zheng became an associate of Empress Wei's, and in 708, when he was serving as the minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing), submitted an interpretation of popular songs that suggested that both Emperor Zhongzong and Empress Wei's authorities had divine origins, which pleased Emperor Zhongzong greatly. In 709, Zheng was made the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu), and given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. He, along with Cui, was in charge of selecting officials, and both of them were said to be corrupt. Later in 709, after indictment by the censors Jin Heng (Èù≥ÊÅÜ) and Li Shangyin and investigation by the censor Pei Cui (Ë£¥Êºº), Cui and Zheng were removed from their offices. Cui was initially supposed to demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, roughly modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), while Zheng was to be exiled to Ji Prefecture (ÂêâÂ∑û, roughly modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). After intercession by Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, as well as Li Guo'er and Li Guo'er's new husband Wu Yanxiu (Ê≠¶Âª∂ÁßÄ), Cui was instead made the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (Ë•ÑÂ∑û, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei), and Zheng was made the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture. However, later in the year, when Emperor Zhongzong was set to make sacrifices to heaven and earth south of Chang'an, he recalled both Cui and Zheng to attend to him during the ceremony and apparently made deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). After Emperor Zhongzong's death Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly in 710‚Äîa death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could become \\"emperor\\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was made emperor (as Emperor Shang), and Empress Wei retained authority as empress dowager and regent. For reasons lost to history, she demoted Zheng Yin out of the capital, back to being the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture. While he went through Jun Prefecture (ÂùáÂ∑û, in modern Shiyan, Hubei), he secretly discussed with Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongfu the Prince of Qiao, the prefect of Jun Prefecture, whom Emperor Zhongzong had disfavored and exiled, and Zhang Lingjun (ÂºµÈùàÂùá), about rising in rebellion against Empress Dowager Wei.However, the modern Chinese historian Bo Yang, in his Modern Chinese Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, interpreted the records as reading that Empress Dowager Wei did not demote Zheng, but rather that Zheng's contact with Li Chongfu happened during his demotion in 709, implicitly interpreting Zheng's repromotion to have occurred under Empress Dowager Wei. See Bo Yang, Modern Chinese Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 50. Sometime thereafter, Zheng was recalled to the capital to serve as Mishu Shaojian (ÁßòÊõ∏Â∞ëÁõ£), the deputy director of the Palace Library. Less than a month after Emperor Zhongzong's death, a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi killed Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. Subsequently, Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, returned to the throne (as Emperor Ruizong), displacing Emperor Shang. Zheng was demoted to be the prefect of Yuan Prefecture (Ê≤ÖÂ∑û, roughly modern Huaihua, Hunan). He intentionally stopped over in Luoyang, knowing that Li Chongfu, under Zhang's instigation, would soon rebel. He prepared the mansion of Li Chongfu's brother-in-law Pei Sun (Ë£¥Â∑Ω, the husband of LI Chongfu's sister Princess Yicheng), and also drafted two edicts‚Äîone purportedly from Emperor Zhongzong, ordering Li Chongfu to take the throne, and one for Li Chongfu, declaring himself emperor. On September 9, 710,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Li Chongfu arrived at Luoyang and took over Pei's mansion, and the officials at Luoyang, surprised, largely began to flee. Li Chongfu began to try to take command of the imperial troops in Luoyang, but the official Li Yong (ÊùéÈÇï) persuaded the imperial guards to reject Li Chongfu, and when Li Chongfu arrived at imperial guards' camps, they fired arrows at him. His attacks on the governmental offices were also repelled. He thereafter fled and tried to hide, but the next day, with troops closing in on his position, he jumped into a canal and drowned. Zheng tried to flee by putting on women's clothes and changing his hair style into a woman's hairstyle, but was nevertheless captured. When both he and Zhang were interrogated, he was so fearful that he was shivering and unable to answer any questions. Zhang, who answered questions normally, commented as he looked on Zheng, \\"I deserve defeat for starting a rebellion with this kind of a man.\\" Both Zheng and Zhang were taken to a busy marketplace and beheaded in public.

Examples include: :* Opposing welfare restrictions. When the newly-libertarian Kansas Legislature in 2015 began a series of \\"attacks on the poor,\\" these included bills introduced with exceptionally detailed lists of restrictions on welfare recipients, forbidding a wide range of purchases with welfare money, and limiting welfare cash disbursements to $30 per day, severely complicating bill-payment and other financial management issues for welfare recipients -- unusual restrictions which drew international attention. Faust-Goudeau was the most frequently cited opponent of the proposed restrictions.Marso, Andy, \\"Kansas Senate Passes Passel Of Welfare Restrictions\\" Apr 2, 2015, KCUR-FM radio news. :* Food sales tax elimination bill. With the increasingly- libertarian Kansas Legislature in 2014-2015 opposing taxes at every turn, Faust-Goudeau joined with new Republican/libertarian legislator Michael O'Donnell to propose the elimination of sales taxes on food (widely decried as a \\"regressive\\" tax disproportionately affecting the poor and working class families, and outlawed in several other states). Specifically, their Senate Bill 263 would have eliminated the state tax on fruits and vegetables. At the time of the bill, the Kansas sales tax on groceries was among the highest in the nation (second only to Mississippi), further aggravated by Kansas localities often adding additional taxes to groceries. However, during a growing state funding crisis brought on by Republicans' previous tax-cutting measures, the grocery tax-relief bill faced little support from the Republican/Libertarian-controlled legislature and Governor. But, at the close of the 2015 Legislative Session, a variation of Faust-Goudeau's plan passed the Kansas Senate, and (at this writing, June 8, 2015) awaits House approval.\\"Wichita senators seek to eliminate grocery sales tax\\", Wichita Business Journal, Oct 22, 2014\\"2 senators seek to eliminate food sales tax in Kansas\\", The Salina Post, Oct. 22, 2014Weeks, Bob, editor, \\"Kansas sales tax on groceries is among the highest\\", October 21, 2014, WichitaLiberty.org (prominent Wichita Libertarian news blog)Wingerter, Justin \\"Legislators Debate Sales Tax on Food\\", June 3, 2015, Topeka Capital-Journal in the Salina Journal\\"Kansas Senate considers eliminating food sales tax\\", Feb. 24, 2015, WDAF-TV \\"Fox 4 KC\\"\\"Kansas Senate approves tax increases, state budget\\", June 7, 2015, Wichita Eagle in Kansas City Star Recognition \\"Legislator of the Year Award, 2011,\\" by the \\"Silver-Haired Legislature\\"‚Äîa prominent Kansas senior-citizens' lobbying organization. \\"10 to Watch in 2010\\"‚Äîlist of 10 noteworthy leaders cited by the state's largest newspaper, the Wichita Eagle. \\"Perfect Attendance\\" record‚Äîappearing for all Senate votes, in 2010, 2011‚Äîaccording to various press releases by the Senate Minority Leaders' Office, and other sources.

It is a form of congenital cystic bronchiectasis. This leads to collapse of the airways and bronchiectasis. It acts as one of the differential to Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. WCS is a deficiency of the bronchial cartilage distally. Symptoms # Persistent cough # Wheeze # Impaired lung function Pathology It is thought to result from a deficiency of cartilage formation in the 4th to 6th order segmental bronchi. Diagnosis Most described cases present sporadically in early childhood. However, some have been diagnosed as late as adulthood. Due to its rarity it presents a difficulty in adult diagnoses, and its initial presentation can be confused with septic shock. Diagnosis requires an appropriate clinical history, the characteristic expiratory airway collapse on radiological investigation, and exclusion of other causes of congenital and acquired bronchiectasis. Pathology of the affected bronchi by bronchoscopy showing the deficiency of cartilaginous plates in the bronchial wall is the confirmatory test. However, lung biopsy has several complications and is not always diagnostic. Considering its non-invasive methodology, facility of execution, and good patient tolerance, multi-slice spiral CT or CT bronchoscopy should be the test of choice to study cystic lung diseases in particular WCS. Radiologically, the lungs are overinflated, and on bronchoscopy bronchomalacia is demonstrated.  Treatment  In 2011, Hacken et al. conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer what are the effects of treatments in people with bronchiectasis but without cystic fibrosis. There are not enough studies to prove if bronchopulmonary hygiene, physical therapy, mucolytics, inhaled hyperosmolar agents, oral corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, short-acting beta 2 agonists, long-acting beta 2 agonists, or anticholinergic therapy is beneficial. However, there are some promising results in other approaches. = Lung transplantation = This was previously attempted in a patient with end-stage lung disease secondary to WCS. Although the patient did not have proximal airway collapse prior to transplantation, his posttransplant course was complicated by the development of bronchomalacia of the right and left mainstem bronchi. The patient experienced recurrent pulmonary infections and died of bacterial pneumonia one year after transplantation. In 2012, the first WCS patient lung transplant with prolonged survival (approaching 10 years) was reported. = Lobectomy = Surgery to remove part of the lungs is often considered for people with extreme damage to one or two lobes of the lung who are at risk of severe infection or bleeding. However, surgery in two patients, one given a triple lobectomy and the other a right upper lobectomy, resulted in severe respiratory failure. = Medicine = WCS is an obstructive disorder that shares some similarities with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been reported to improve chronic respiratory failure in patients with bronchiectasis. NPPV combined with long-term home oxygen therapy decreases carbon dioxide retention and improves dyspnea in hypercapnic COPD. Moreover, long-term NPPV may decrease acute exacerbation and recurrent hospitalization. There are case reports that NPPV may have an advantage in adult patients with WCS who have severe respiratory failure and recurrent pulmonary infections. History It was described in 1960 by Howard Williams and Peter Campbell. They described a case study of five children with similar clinical and radiological symptoms, and proposed that the abnormal development of cartilage in bronchial tree was responsible for this presentation. In 1976, the first report of the occurrence of familial bronchiectasis in siblings was published, and it supported the theory that WCS was congenital, based on the uniformity of the cartilaginous defect. It may have been the result of an autosomal recessive mutation, but the specific gene has not yet been identified.

It is located below the coastal road, hidden from the sea. Architecture This beautiful medieval building, constructed on a rocky outcrop, has a square keep which, following a partial collapse during the winter of 1995, exposed the interior to reveal a habitable tower of four floors, each with one chamber. History The history of Tr√©mazan is intimately linked to that of the du Chastel (or Ch√¢tel) family. It was they who built it and made it their principal residence for several centuries. The origins of this dynasty are still shrouded in mist, but with the passage of history, they became very prominent. So much so that Chastels ended up taking their place in the high Breton aristocracy and being counted among the four most important families of the Viscounty of L√©on. An old saying characterises L√©on in these terms: \\"antiquit√© de Penho√´t, vaillance du Chastel, richesse de Kermavan et chevalerie de Kergounadeac'h\\" (the antiquity of Penho√´t, the bravery of Chastel, the wealth of Kermavan and the chivalry of Kergounadeac'h). However, by the end of the 16th century, the elder branch of the family died out for lack of a male heir. The present castle goes back mainly to the 13th and 14th centuries. The castle would have been built on the ruins of a castellum already existing in the 6th century. According to legend, Tanneguy du Chastel, founder of the abbey at Saint- Mathieu, was born here. The building became a stone castle around the 10th century. In 1220, it was destroyed during the war against the Duke of Brittany, then rebuilt thirty years later by Bernard du Ch√¢tel. Sold as national property after the French Revolution, the castle was abandoned in the 18th century. Apart from the 12th century square keep, remains include towers and the outer enceinte dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Preservation attempts: SOS Ch√¢teau de Tr√©mazan Today, the non-profit association S.O.S Ch√¢teau de Tr√©mazan attempts to preserve the castle and to increase the knowledge of its past. Thus, samples of the castle beams gave rise to a study of dendrochronology for better dating of the building. Until funds are found for its restoration, the association SOS Ch√¢teau de Tr√©mazan has attempted to finance the establishment of a temporary protection against potential structural collapses. It has been listed since 1926 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

He served as the 26th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dhaka serving from September 2002 until January 2009.. Though an academic and a scientific researcher by profession, Faiz was also the chairman of the Public Service Commission of Bangladesh before his tenure as the vice-chancellor. Early life and education With a bygone ancestry in the district of 24 Parganas at West Bengal State in India, Faiz was brought up in Dhaka mostly. His father AKKB Syed Muhammed Hasan Ali did his graduation from the Presidency College in India. He was a civil servant in the then East Pakistan and retired from his services as a Magistrate in Dhaka. His mother was UN Jobeda Khatun. In his school and college life in Dhaka, Faiz was not a bookish but often a \\"hooky\\" type. However, the average grade in the examinations were good enough for his admission at the Medical College in Dhaka, to fulfill his father's desire. But his stint as a medical student lasted only for about four months by which time he developed a serious dislike of practical anatomy. He got himself admitted at the University of Dhaka in the same year, albeit rather late. He was more intent on making good results which was evident in his bachelor's degree, and also in the master's result in Soil Science in 1968. In December 1970, Faiz went to UK for doing research leading to Ph.D. and obtained the degree in Soil: Plant Water Relations from the Department of Botany, University of Aberdeen, under the supervision of Regius Professor P.E. Weatherley, Fellow of the Royal Society. He came back to a newly independent Bangladesh in March 1973 after completing his Ph.D. in little more than 2 years time. Teaching career Faiz joined the Department of Soil Science, University of Dhaka as an assistant professor on 2 July 1973 and became an associate professor in 1977. He worked as reader (British equivalent to associate professor) in the University of Maidugari, Nigeria for about 4 years before becoming a professor in the Department of Soil Science, Dhaka University in 1986. Prof. Faiz served as the chairman of the Department of Soil Science (Now Department of Soil, Water and Environment) during 1988 to 1991, and also worked as the elected Dean of the Faculty of Biological Sciences, Dhaka University during 1991 to 1993. Faiz was an elected member of Dhaka University Senate and Syndicate. He was the provost of Hazi Md. Mohsin Hall for few years. He writes about higher education sector regularly now. Various leadership and publication Faiz was the elected President of the Dhaka University Teachers Association, and the President of the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Associations, consisting of all the Public Universities of Bangladesh. In 1993 Faiz restyled his career when appointed as the chairman of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (P.S.C) by the President of the country. The constitutional position he held in this quasi-judicial body during 1993 to 1998 gave him the responsibility of selecting suitable candidates for different Civil Service Cadres of the Government, among other things. He was only about 45 years of age before becoming the youngest ever Chairman of P.S.C. He came back to the University in 1998 and in 2002 became the 26th vice-chancellor of the University of Dhaka and served in that capacity till early 2009. Prof. Faiz has published more than 100 scientific papers in national and international journals. Some of his works were highlighted in books published from London by the McGrow- Hill, and the Academic Press. He was one of the Editors of a book entitled ‚ÄúClimate Change and Food Security in South Asia‚Äù published from the Netherlands by Springer. Prof. Faiz was the chairman of the Trustee Board of the Bangladesh National Museum for over 5 years and also served as Chairman of the Trustee Board of the Foundation for Research on Educational Planning and Development (FREPD) for over 6 years. Faiz retired from his services at the University of Dhaka in 2014. At present, Faiz is associated with a private university named State University of Bangladesh with which he had an emotional attachment since inception.

It contains the archaeological remains of a French settlement called Charlesfort, settled in 1562 and abandoned the following year, and the later 16th-century Spanish settlement known as Santa Elena. The Spanish remains include a fort built directly on top of the abandoned Charlesfort remains. This fort and other nearby structures have been called, at various times, Fort San Marcos, Fort San Felipe, and have the designated archaeological site identifiers 38BU51 and 38BU162. Because of their remarkable state of preservation, and their importance in understanding early French and Spanish colonial practices, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. The site is accessible through the United States Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Port Royal, South Carolina. Charlesfort (1562‚Äì1563, 1577-1578) N. Bellin, 18th century Floride fran√ßoise (\\"French Florida\\"), by Pierre du Val, 17th century Charlesfort was established when a French expedition, organized by Huguenot leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny and led by the Norman navigator Jean Ribault, landed at the site on the May River in February 1562, before moving north to Port Royal Sound. There, on present- day Parris Island, South Carolina, Ribault left twenty-eight men to build a settlement. Ribault then returned to France to arrange supplies for the new colony but was arrested in England after becoming involved in the period of unrest known as the French Wars of Religion, which prevented his return. After Ribault left, most of the settlers' stores were burned, and Captain Albert de la Pierria died in a mutiny, possibly as a reaction to his heavy discipline. Without supplies or leadership, and beset by hostility from the native population, all but one of the remaining colonists sailed back to Europe after only a year. They built their own boat and set sail, without compass, across the Atlantic. During the long voyage in an open boat, they were reduced to cannibalism before the survivors were finally rescued in English waters by an English ship, and some eventually reached France. Shortly after the colonists' departure, Hernando de Manrique de Rojas commanded a Spanish force from Cuba that destroyed the French fort, and took captive the one Frenchman who had remained with the local Native Americans nearby. In January 1577, in a period when the Spanish settlement had been destroyed and not yet rebuilt, the French returned in the ship Le Prince. The expedition was commanded by Nicholas Strozzi, who may have been a brother of Filippo di Piero Strozzi. The ship was lost as they entered Port Royal Sound, and the men built a triangular fort, 130 feet on each side, enclosing five buildings. Many were killed by Native Americans and the rest had been taken captive by the time Spanish returned in spring 1578. The Spanish obtained the captives from the Native Americans during 1578-80 and hanged almost all of them. Santa Elena (1566‚Äì1587) Founded in 1566 on the site of Charlesfort, Santa Elena was the first capital of Spanish Florida. Fort San Salvador, a simple blockhouse, was built first, and then Fort San Felipe was built directly on top of the old French fort in that year, with a new moat (the French one having been filled in). It was occupied until 1570, when it was destroyed by fire. The Spanish then built a second fort, also called Fort San Felipe, at an unknown nearby location. The fort and town were abandoned in 1576 due in part to hostility of the local Native Americans. and In 1577 the Spanish returned, and built Fort San Marcos. It was used until 1582 or 1583, when a second Fort San Marcos was constructed. This fortification had a moat dug around it in 1586, in anticipation of an attack by Sir Francis Drake. Santa Elena and the fortifications were finally abandoned in 1587. At its height, the town had about sixty dwellings, with an estimated population of 400-450. Archaeological history Fort Charles NE bastion The area's archaeological importance was first identified in the mid-19th century by amateurs, who found what they believed to be Charlesfort, and excavated large hinges such as would have been used on a large gate. In the summer of 1917 some of the earthworks associated with the first Fort San Felipe were leveled by Marine Corps personnel, filling in part of the moat. In the 1920s Major George Osterhout led an excavation of that site, which he concluded was that of Charlesfort. In response to this determination, a memorial marker was placed at the site. Osterhout's interpretation was soon disputed, and by the 1950s archaeological consensus was that the site was part of Spanish Santa Elena. It was only after a series of excavations, running from the 1970s to the 1990s, that the full history and layout of the area was identified. Identification of the French fort location was made possible by the restricted location of distinctively French artifacts, and by the evidence that multiple moats had been dug around the site of the first Fort San Marcos. The site is one of unparalleled importance in the early colonial history of North America and South Carolina, exemplifying the early competition for control of the region. Finds at the site also include the only known early Spanish pottery kiln on the continent. Since the area was never developed agriculturally, even surface-level remains continue to be found.

Life Nico Goldinger was born in Riga, Latvia, then part of Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution (1917) his family moved to the Ukraine, and then to Moscow, where he trained as a ballet dancer. He later moved to Berlin, where he read languages and history at Berlin University, and played chess rather than bridge. He moved to London in 1936, where his bridge career began. His father had been a banker, but in Germany the family became timber merchants. Nico changed his surname to Gardener after he settled in London. He became a naturalised British citizen in due course.Alan Hiron 1988 and [1989]. Article and obituary, reprinted in Hasenson P. 2004. British Bridge Almanack. 77, London. pp. 90, 188.  Career  Gardener's partners in bridge competition included some of the great players of the day, such as Pedro Juan, Victor Mollo, Louis Tarlo, Iain MacLeod and Adam Meredith. As a tournament player he won World Mixed Teams in 1962 with Boris Schapiro, Rixi Markus and Fritzi Gordon. He won the European Championship twice out of five attempts, and competed in two Bermuda Bowls (1950 and 1962) and the 1960 Olympiad. In domestic bridge he won the Gold Cup six times, firstly in 1946, and the Waddington Master Pairs in 1953. He won the Sunday Times Invitational Pairs in 1970 with Tony Priday; this prestigious tournament featured some of the world's strongest partnerships. He also played rubber bridge for many years at Lederer's club and at his own London School of Bridge. Gardener was married, and became the father of Nicola Smith (born 1949), the leading British woman player of the 1975‚Äì1995 period. His wife, Pat Gardener n√©e Hyman (c. 1920‚Äì1988), was also an international player: she played in three European women's championships. Nico founded the London School of Bridge in 1952 in the King's Road, Chelsea, above a frock shop. There he supervised the bridge teaching and the rubber bridge rooms where beginners could practice at the game for small stakes. The teachers were some of the best players in the country, and there were about 2000 students each year. The school survived his death, but no longer exists. Another of Nico's ventures was the bridge cruise, of which he was an early promoter. Each summer would find him hosting on a Mediterranean cruise ship, conducting lessons and practice in four or five different languages, and accompanied by an attractive assistant. One of Gardener's established partners was the outstanding and prolific bridge writer Victor Mollo, a contemporary whose family fled Russia after the 1917 revolution. Together they produced two classic books.

San Marino are a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB). Overview 2013 The Republic of San Marino still doesn't have a National Team for rugby 15. The only existing national rugby team of the Republic of San Marino is a rugby 7s team. This team was born on the occasion of his first competition on 25 and 26 May 2013, in the twenty-seventh edition of the annual international tournament \\"Benidorm Seven\\", in the homonymous city, in Spain. *Coach: Francesco Urbani *Assistant coach: Jorge Gutierrez *Fitness coach: Francesca Pasini *Players: Davide Bacciocchi (cap.), Mattia Bastianelli, Gianluca Conti, Luca Di Bisceglie, Michele Garavini, Davide Giardi, Francesco Gobbi, Franco Maiani, Facundo Maiani, Fabio Matteini, Samuele Soldati, Carlo Terenzi This national team ended up last in the above- mentioned competition, suffering six defeats against the following six formations: Crusaders (United Kingdom), Barbarians (Belgium), Grenoble, La Vila, Comunidad Valenciana and a selection of Malaysia. It should however be noted that these other formations are selections of professional players, while the National Team of San Marino is made up exclusively of players from the Rugby Club San Marino and absolutely amateur, as well as being at their first experience of rugby 7s outside the territory of the Republic of San Marino. Considering the enormous gap in the players' levels, it should be considered a good result the six tries scored by the National Team in the whole tournament (an average of one try per game). The tries were scored by Bastianelli (2), Garavini, Giardi, Gobbi and Maiani Fa. 2014 The second performance (which is also the first \\"official\\" one) of the national team took place in Thessaloniki (Greece) on 31 May 2014, in the B-category of the European tournament of rugby 7 FIRA-AER. Players: Navid Ataei, Mattia Bastianelli (cap.), Gianluca Conti, Niccol√≤ Cozza, Luca Di Bisceglie, Juan Pablo Flores, Davide Giardi, Francesco Gobbi, Franco Maiani, Fabio Matteini, Carlo Terenzi, Fabio Tonelli Again the team ended up last (10th place) in the competition, also due to the hard pool in which it was placed by drawing lots, that is against Hungary, Austria and Montenegro. Despite being highly inferior to the opponents, both on a technical and physical side, the sammarinese selection managed to avoid to cut a poor figure, showing good game and intimidating several times the enemies' defenses; this in particular against Hungary, that will end up first in the tournament earning the chance to fight for the A-category next year. The results: *Hungary - San Marino 27-14 (tries: Bastianelli 1, Giardi 1) *Austria - San Marino 38-15 (tries: Bastianelli 2, Giardi 1) *Montenegro - San Marino 40-7 (tries: Cozza 1) 2015 On 6 June 2015 drove to Zenica (Bosnia and Herzegovina) to take part in the Rugby Europe Men's Sevens Championships, Division C.

Ended up 8th, losing the last three matches vs Serbia, Estonia and Malta. An honorable result, 8th on 12, for the small Republic of San Marino, being also listed above some stronger and more experienced teams, like Montenegro (11th) and Belarus (10th).

The crew of fifteen were lost. The event is commemorated annually at D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour. The SS Palme The SS Palme, a 1,114 ton barque, was owned by the Erikson family of Mariehamn, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. She sailed under the Russian flag of horizontal white, blue, and red. On 18 December she set sail from Liverpool bound for South America to import hardwood. She was commanded by Captain Wiren. He was accompanied by his wife and child. There was a crew of seventeen, three of whom spoke English. Weather A storm described as \\"the most severe of the century\\" developed. The Palme tried to seek shelter in Dublin Bay, but was driven south-east. It was mid-winter and extremely cold. The sea was so heavy that waves were crashing over the light house at the end of the East Pier of D√∫n Laoghaire. On Tuesday 24 December the Palme was seen dragging her anchor off Merrion strand. The Palme was in danger of being smashed on the rocks. She fired distress rockets. The disaster A new lifeboat, Civil Service Number One had recently been delivered to Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire). Under Coxwain Alexander Williams it went to assist the Palme. As she approached the Palme, the crew lowered the sails and rowed. Then, in full public view, the lifeboat was raised by a mighty wave and then capsized. Some of the lifeboat crew managed to climb onto the upturned hull. The crew of the Palme then tried to launch their longboat, in the hope of rescuing their rescuers. This longboat was smashed by the waves. The older lifeboat Hannah Pickard, under Coxswain Horner, then went to sea. She was also capsized, but righted herself and her crew all got back on board. She was driven ashore at Vance's Harbour, Blackrock. The Poolbeg lifeboat, under Coxswain Captain Dalton, was also launched. She found conditions ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô and had to turn back. Two tugs, Flying Sprite and Flying Swallow also tried and failed. All hope of rescuing the Palme was now abandoned. On Christmas Day, 25 December, crowds watched and prayed as the Palme was being broken by the gales. There was widespread public and press interest. Rescue On St. Stephen's Day 26 December, the Irish Lights steamer Tearaght under Captain McCombie managed to reach the Palme and rescue all twenty on board. In addition, they rescued the ship's cat. By then eight bodies of the lifeboat men had been recovered. In time, all fifteen bodies were found. Aftermath Memorial to the crew. The funeral was the largest seen in D√∫n Laoghaire. Flags were lowered in all European ports. All fifteen were buried together in Deans Grange Cemetery. A fund was raised to support their dependents. There were donations from the ship's owners in Finland and from ‚Äòthe people of Russia‚Äô. There is a plaque on the old lifeboat station wall and a granite memorial. Every year the event is remembered. At noon every Christmas Eve there is a procession along the East Pier, led by a piper. A short service is then held.

The 96th is equipped with the Boeing B-52H Stratofortress. Formed in August 1917, the 96 BS saw combat on the World War I Western Front, in France. It took part in the St. Mihiel offensive and Meuse-Argonne offensive. Later, it served with the Army Air Service and Army Air Corps in the Inter-War period it participated in Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell's 1921 off-shore bombing tests and during World War II fought in the North African and Italian Campaigns. It was a part of Strategic Air Command during the Cold War. Since 1993, the 96th Bomb Squadron has flown the B-52H Stratofortress long-range heavy bomber, which can perform a variety of missions. Today the squadron is engaged in the Global War on Terrorism. History =World War I= The 96th Aero Squadron was America's first bomb squadron. It was formed at Kelly Field, Texas. Originally consisting of 80 men, largely college graduates or college dropouts, volunteers all, and something of an elite group, since their aeronautical qualifications were the highest in the U.S. Army Air Service. Just before embarking upon its first aerial warfare, the squadron decided upon its insignia, a black triangle outlined by a white strip enclosing the profile of a red devil thumbing his nose at the ground with his left hand. In his right, he held a white bomb. This distinctive emblem was designed by the squadron's talented graphic artist, Harry O. Lawson. The 96th saw combat as part of the 1st Day Bombardment Group, supporting the French Eighth and U.S. First Army from, 12 June 1918 ‚Äì 4 November 1918. It operated French-made Breguet 14 planes and was involved in an embarrassing fiasco when the entire squadron landed around Koblenz, Germany by accident, providing all of their planes intact to the Germans. Nonetheless, it was the most heavily engaged and most successful USAS bomber squadron. =Inter-War period= Returned to the United States from France in May, 1919, was re-organized at Ellington Field, Houston, Texas and equipped with Martin MB-2 day bombers. Reassigned to several airfields in the southwest, its primary mission was reconnaissance along the Mexican border. In May 1920 was temporarily assigned to Langley Field, Virginia and became part of the First Provisional Air Brigade under General Billy Mitchell. Trained with the Handley Page O/400 and Martin MB-2 bombers. Its mission would be to attack captured German ships along the Atlantic coast off Virginia in a service demonstration to determine whether a battleship could be sunk by bombing. The targets were an aged and surplus US battleship and four former German Navy vessels, including the battleship , obtained in the peace settlement after World War I and scheduled for scuttling. SMS Frankfurt burning after being bombed SMS Ostfriesland with a bomb exploding near her bow 1921. On 13 July the Army airmen made their first appearance. The Martin bombers (limited to 300-pound bombs by the rules of the service test by the Navy) sank the former German destroyer G-102 in 19 minutes. On 18 July Navy and Army airplanes took turns attacking the former German light cruiser . No bomb heavier than 600 pounds was allowed. There were frequent intermissions as inspectors dragged out their on-board inspections. The Air Service was finally allowed to strike and sank the vessel with 600-pound bombs. The Navy, which had figured on using gunfire from ships to finish off Frankfurt, was surprised. On 21 July a flight of six Martins and two Handley Pages, each carrying a 2,000-pound bomb. As the pilots stood by waiting to take off, Johnson called with a change in rules. The bombers could bring no more than three of their biggest bombs to the target area. The written agreement had been that the Air Service would be allowed two direct hits with their biggest bombs. One of the Handley Pages had to drop out of the formation, but the other seven airplanes went on to the target. They had no intention of making two direct hits and stopping the test. Their orders were to aim for near misses to create water hammer shock waves against the hull. The first bomb fell at 12:18 p.m. It was a near miss, as planned. The other airplanes swept in at spaced intervals and delivered their ordnance. \\"We could see her rise eight or 10 feet between the terrific blows from under water,\\" Mitchell said. The sixth bomb, at 12:31, sealed Ostfriesland‚Äôs doom. Twenty-two minutes after the first bomb fell, the old battleship sank at 12:40. The seventh airplane, a Handley Page, dropped its unneeded bomb as a final salute at the point where the battleship had gone down. With the completion of the demonstration, the 96th returned to Texas in October. The unit transferred to Langley Field on a permanent basis in June 1922 and engaged in routine training; tested and experimented with equipment and tactics; participated in maneuvers; flew mercy missions to aid victims of a flood in Pennsylvania in 1936 and victims of an earthquake in Chile in 1939; and made goodwill flights to South America in the late 1930s. Received new Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress in the summer of 1939, being one of the first three squadrons to receive the new bomber. In November 1939, seven Fortresses flew from Langley Field to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on a good-will mission. All planes returned safely with no major incidents, once again demonstrating the safety and reliability of the B-17 design. =World War II= Lockheed-Vega B-17G-50-VE Fortress-44-8167-96th Bomb Squadron. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, served on antisubmarine duty along the mid- Atlantic coastline as part of I Bomber Command for several months until AAF Antisubmarine Command was formed and took over that duty. Re-equipped with more modern B-17F Flying Fortresses and assigned to II Bomber Command in Pacific Northwest for transition and combat training in late 1942 and early 1943. Moved to North Africa in April 1943, carrying out bombing missions in Algeria and Tunisia as part of Twelfth Air Force during the North African Campaign. Flew many support and interdictory missions, bombing such targets as marshalling yards, airdromes, troop concentrations, bridges, docks, and shipping. Participated in the defeat of Axis forces in Tunisia, Apr-May 1943; the reduction of Pantelleria and the preparations for the invasion of Sicily, May-Jul 1943; the invasion of Italy, Sep 1943. Transferred to Fifteenth Air Force in December 1943 and engaged in bombing operations primarily in Italy in support of the Allied drive north toward Rome, Jan-Jun 1944; the Invasion of southern France, Aug 1944; and the campaigns against German forces in northern Italy, Jun 1944-May 1945. Engaged primarily in long-range bombardment of strategic targets after Oct 1943, attacking oil refineries, aircraft factories, steel plants, and other objectives in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Greece. En route to bomb a vital aircraft factory at Steyr on 24 Feb 1944, the group was greatly outnumbered by enemy interceptors, but it maintained its formation and bombed the target, receiving a Distinguished Service Cross for the performance. On the following day, while on a mission to attack aircraft factories at Regensburg, it met similar opposition equally well and was awarded a second DUC. Served as part of the occupation force in Italy after V-E Day. Inactivated in Italy on 28 Feb 1946. =Cold War= Reactivated under Strategic Air Command on 1 July 1947 and equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Trained for strategic bombardment missions during the postwar years, being upgraded to the new atomic bomb-capable Boeing B-50 Superfortress in 1948. Replaced the propeller-driven B-50s with new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements or to storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona in late 1962 and was inactivated in April 1963. =Reactivation= The squadron was reactivated on October 1st, 1993 as part of the 2nd Operations Group, 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana using the personnel, facilities and aircraft from the recently inactivated 596th Bomb Squadron. On August 1st 1994 B-52H's 60-0008 \\"Lucky Lady IV\\" and 60-0059 \\"Laissez Le Bon Temps Roulez\\" set off on a round the world bombing mission, named Exercise Global Power 94-7. The bombers (using the callsigns Storm 1 & Storm 2) flew east and after around 17 hours into the flight they each dropped 27 Mk82 500lb bombs on the Udairi Bomb Range in Kuwait from a height of 800 feet. The two bombers continued flying east and landed back at Barksdale AFB 47.2 hours later, setting a new world record. In September 1996, it deployed and launched attacks against military targets in Iraq in support of Operation Desert Strike. It earned the 1996 Mackay Trophy for the 33-hour long mission from Louisiana to Iraq and back as the most meritorious flight of the year. Since 1993 it has conducted combat operations to support worldwide conventional and nuclear taskings and provided long-range, heavy strike, initial response, and sustained firepower in support of all regional and global warfighting commanders. In late 1996, the squadron deployed to support Operation Southern Watch, returning again in 1998. In 1999, crews from the squadron deployed to Royal Air Force Base Fairford in support of Operation Allied Force. In January 2002, the squadron deployed to fly combat missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan. It supported OEF until early 2007 when it began focusing full-time on the continuous bomber presence mission in the Pacific Theater. The squadron supported deployments in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009 and again in 2011 to Andersen AFB, Guam. In 2011, as part of Air Force Global Strike Command's Global Strike Challenge (successor to SAC's Bomb Comp), the 96th Bomb Squadron won three awards: : The Bartsch Trophy for best ECM Score beating 9 other B-52 squadrons/units, : The Mitchell Trophy for best bombing score (6 meter BDU-50, beating 19 other B-1, B-2 and B-52 squadrons/units), and : The Linebacker Trophy for best B-52 Squadron in 2011.

The film follows a year in the life of the girls in the third dormitory at a secluded boarding school, where new students arrive in coffins. Plot After a series of images of rushing water, forest, and dark, empty subterranean hallways, six-year-old Iris arrives topless inside a coffin placed in a dormitory's common area, where she is met with general warmth and curiosity by the other six girls who live in the house. After dressing her in a uniform matching theirs and brushing and braiding her hair, the girls all exchange hair ribbons with each other-each girl gets the ribbons passed down from the girl a year above her, and the colour marks their age and year in the school. Iris, the new youngest \\"red ribbon\\", unfortunately excites the ire of seven-year-old Selma, the former red ribbon and now orange ribbon, who complains about the absence of the former violet-ribbon Natashka‚Äîthe oldest who had been her friend. The new violet ribbon, twelve-year-old Bianca, takes Iris under her wing. At first Iris is homesick, and wants to be reunited with her brother, but Bianca matter-of-factly tells her there is no possibility of that: there are no boys allowed in the school. All of the girls in the school go swimming in the lake, and Iris quickly befriends Laura, the red-ribbon of another house. That night, much to Iris's dismay, Bianca leaves on an authorized mysterious errand that she cannot discuss. The next day, Iris has a routine day at the school ‚Äì dance lessons, classroom time with animals, and recreation. The classes at the school are run by two pretty young women: Mademoiselle Edith, who walks with a cane and teaches lessons, and Mademoiselle Eva, who teaches dance. Each house is cared for by an elderly serving woman; the girls whisper that all of the employees are girls who tried to escape the walled school in their youth, and were pressed into permanent service as punishment. One night, Iris follows Bianca on her secret errand, but she loses track of the older girl once she reaches the main building. She explores, but only stumbles across more she does not understand: a shadowy man preparing an injection for a shadowy girl (possibly Bianca.) She flees, and is lost in the woods for the night. After a period of smouldering animosity, Selma makes overtures to befriend Iris, but then beats her with a switch (stem) when Iris asks about Bianca's nightly departures. Selma also uses her fingertip, touching Iris's wound, to gingerly taste Iris's blood. As time passes, Laura, unlike Iris, is morose and unable to adapt to life at the school. With Iris's help ‚Äì and a pledge of secrecy ‚Äì she steals a rowboat in an attempt to escape, but drowns when the boat starts to leak and the weather turns sour. A distressed Iris tells Bianca what Laura has done. The school holds a funeral, where Laura's coffin is burned on a pyre. As winter arrives, the focus shifts to the ten-year-old Alice, the fifth-year blue ribbon, who is hungry to leave the school and see the world outside. She has placed her hopes on winning the annual inspection of the blue ribbons, where the mysterious headmistress arrives from afar and, after watching them dance, chooses one girl from the class to leave the school early with her for an unknown reason. Though Edith cautions that she shouldn't get her hopes up, Alice has been anticipating this moment ‚Äì and her own winning of the honour of leaving. Though the competition is close, another girl is chosen instead. Hysterical, Alice collapses at the headmistress's feet. She convalesces, but isn't the same as before: she doesn't speak, and aimlessly and perpetually stares into space. Finally, she runs out into the woods surrounding the school buildings, and climbs over the stone wall that surrounds the school. As we see her flee into the snowy woods beyond, camouflaged by her white uniform, we hear the sound of distant gunshots and barking dogs. Later, as Eva looks pensively out a window, Edith informs her that Alice cannot be found; she then informs the other girls that Alice has been very bad, and will not be seen or spoken of again. After Alice's escape (and possible death,) the focus turns to Bianca. The violet ribbons are told about the bodily changes that they will soon experience, and Bianca grows pensive. For the first time, she brings Nadja, the black-ribbon girl a year her junior, along on her nighttime trip. Together, they go to the main school building, and enter a secret passage behind the grandfather clock. There, the girls get into butterfly costumes, and prepare: each night they put on a dance recital for a mysterious audience. The next night, Nadja falters, but a man in the audience calls out to Bianca, telling her she is the most beautiful, and throws her a rose. After the show, Bianca and another girl explore the empty theater. They find an abandoned men's theatre glove, and encounter one of the servants counting the performance's receipts‚Äîthis, the girls are informed, is how the school makes its money. Bianca keeps the rose and the glove as a treasure, and fantasizes about the glove's touch, but ultimately casts them both into the water of the lake. Iris and Bianca spend the morning together on what Bianca explains will be her last day at the school. After a formal, tearful goodbye, she passes off her duties to Nadja. Bianca and the other violet ribbons put their ribbons in a box, and accompany Eva and Edith further down the hallway behind the clock than they've ever been before. There, they board a subway train, and leave the school. Eva smokes a cigarette. Back at the house, a new girl emerges from her coffin, to be greeted by Iris, Selma, and the others. The train arrives at a grand, modern plaza, and Eva and Edith leave the girls. Bianca and the other girls immediately begin playing in the fountains nearby. A group of nearby teenage boys lose their ball in the fountain, and one wades in after it. Though he is obscured by the fountain's display, he fascinates Bianca. She playfully splashes water at him, and he splashes back. The film ends as it began, with a shot of rushing water.

Water is very important, as it is a highly visible medium in its many forms (including within or from underneath a surface), and it is necessary, sensual, and enjoyable, but also dangerous (the drowning), and evokes many emotions. Flowing water can also symbolize the passage of time. The dynamic of children relating to adults, not understating them or their actions, while seeing them as role models, is another dichotomy the director wanted to emphasize. Ambiguity and a 'dream-like' quality are also important elements of the film. She states they digitally enhanced or 'tweaked' colors in the film to 'non-realistic' tones, to achieve mood and lighting effect, particularly day for night shots. The director says she is not interested in explaining meaning: \\"... what I like in cinema is being lost. I like films I don't completely understand, so they stay with me longer after they're over,\\" and, \\"I believe everyone can find their own stories within the film.\\" DVD extras.

History Nagpur was ruled by Gond kings, then later by Maratha Bhonsale before the British East India Company took over the city. The Gond Kingdom and Bhonsale Raj had five elements, based on ancient Indian and medieval police tradition, viz. police under revenue authorities, village kotwals and city kotwals. Kotwal was the cornerstone of the police. Previously a large establishment of Hakaras scattered over the Nagpur Province, along with See bandies: a small army at important places. The duty of Hakaras was to contact Kamavisdar and Patels to prevent crime and apprehend offenders. When Raghoji III ascended to the throne of the Nagpur kingdom in 1826, he allowed the Nagpur police to work independently under Salauddin. The law and order situation improved under Raghuji rule. When he died without a male heir in 1853, the kingdom was annexed by the British under the Doctrine of Lapse. In 1854, the Nagpur Police had five hundred men with a Daroga in each Tahsil and Naib Daroga and Jamadars posted in small Thanas and the Burkandaz (Sepoys) distributed as per requirements. The revenue department was merged into the Nagpur police. The Nagpur police were re-organized after new Central Provinces were formed along with Berar. City police had to face the Nagpur Grain Riots of 1896-2347. = 1994 Gowari stampede = On 23 November 1994, 114 people from the Gowari community were killed and 500 more injured in a stampede. Nagpur Police failed to disperse almost 50,000 Gowari protesters. They attempted a baton charge that created a panic and triggered a stampede. Most of the casualties were women and children who were crushed as the crowd was scrambling to escape the police line. Some were pierced as they were climbing over a high fence. Maharashtra state government appointed Justice S S Dani commission to investigate the event, but he held nobody responsible and referred to the tragedy as an \\"unfortunate\\" one. The commission upheld the police action. =Samuels case= The Nagpur police claimed that they had tapes showing West Indies cricketer Marlon Samuels passing on information to a bookie just prior to the international game against India in Nagpur on 21 January 2007. Virendra Thakur, Narendra Saoji and Birjesh Gwalvanshi were involved in the double murder case under section 302 of IPC.

History Prior to formalized professional play, Detroit was a hotbed for softball, with some of the top players in the country playing in competitive local leagues and for national softball championships. A major sponsor of softball in the Detroit area was Little Caesar's Pizza, whose team had won the 1970 Amateur Softball Association national title. The company was founded and owned by Mike Ilitch, a former Detroit Tigers farmhand and later the owner of the MLB team, one of several professional sports team he was eventually to own. The Caesars were his first step into professional sports ownership. The APSPL was formed by former World Football League staffer Bill Byrne, who would go on to form the Women's Professional Basketball League, who hired former New York Yankees player Whitey Ford as commissioner. Detroit was the last team to join the newly formed league. The Caesars played at Memorial Field in Eastpointe, Michigan (named East Detroit at that time), a small suburb of Detroit. With promotions tied in with the pizza chain and the signing of former Detroit Tiger stars, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley and Norm Cash, fans packed into the small stands to lead the league in attendance and to witness not only Detroit's best softball players, but those whom Ilitch had brought to town to make his team into the powerhouse of professional softball. Mike Nye, Ron Ford, Bert Smith, Mike Gouin and Tex Collins (all five had received amateur softball Player of the Year honors from Southern Softball magazine) and other softball stars took to the field for Detroit, led by manager Gary Vitto, and the Caesars would go on to win two World Series titles before disbanding after the 1979 season. 1977 APSPL champions In 1977, Detroit dominated the league with a league best record of 42‚Äì14, two games ahead of the Kentucky Bourbons' 40‚Äì16 mark. Detroit and Kentucky received first-round playoff byes and the Caesars beat the Cleveland Jaybirds 2‚Äì1 (4‚Äì7, 22‚Äì5, 8‚Äì6) to advance to the first professional softball World Series against the Baltimore Monuments. The Caesars would dominate the series and win 4‚Äì0 (18‚Äì16, 13‚Äì8, 25‚Äì16, 28‚Äì11) with Mike Nye taking the MVP trophy having batted 12‚Äì20 with 2 home-runs. Six Caesars made the all-league team (Mike Gouin, Ron Ford, Mike Nye, Bert Smith, Tony Mazza, and Doug Gerdes) and only a triple-crown performance by league MVP Chicago Storm catcher Benny Holt could overshadow the individual performances by various Caesars. Mike Nye finished second in the batting race and Ron Ford and Doug Gerdes finished in the top 10. Ford was second in home-runs to Holt with Al Gibson, Bert Smith and Gerdes of the Caesars all in the top-10. RBIs were similar with Ford finishing second in the league and Gerdes, Smith and Gibson in the top-10. 1978 APSPL champions Detroit rolled again in 1978 with another league best record of 49‚Äì15 and received a first-round bye in the playoffs. In the APSPL semifinals the Caesars again faced Cleveland winning 2‚Äì0 (27‚Äì22, 30‚Äì24) advancing to face the Minnesota Norsemen in the World Series. The Caesars would repeat as professional softball champions with a dominating 4‚Äì0 victory (22‚Äì16, 50‚Äì12, 24‚Äì16, 26‚Äì12) as Detroit's Bert Smith hit 15‚Äì16 (.940) with 5 home-runs and 16 RBIs. Ron Ford of Detroit was edged out in the last game of the season by teammate Mike Nye in batting percentage (.654 to .645) to prevent his taking of triple-crown honors, but still took home league MVP with 80 home-runs and 201 RBIs. Seven Detroit players were all-league (Ron Ford, Mike Nye, Doug Gerdes, Gary Geister, Mike Gouin, Jack Roudebush and newcomer Chuck Drewicz). Nye, Ford, Geister and Gouin finished top-10 in batting; Ford and Gerdes top-10 in home-runs and only Ford represented the Caesars in RBI leaders.  1979 APSPL season  1979 was the last year for the team as the Caesars backed up enough to get caught by the rival Milwaukee Schlitz, led by APSPL star Phil Higgins and league and eventual APSPL World Series MVP Rick Weiterman. Detroit would finish second in the Midwestern Division behind Milwaukee and advanced to play the Cincinnati Suds in the first round of the playoffs winning 3‚Äì2 (18‚Äì8, 7‚Äì8, 11‚Äì14, 3‚Äì1, 7‚Äì6). Detroit advanced to the semifinals losing to Milwaukee 3‚Äì0 (11‚Äì5, 7‚Äì4, 5‚Äì1). Milwaukee went on to beat the Kentucky Bourbons in the APSPL World Series, broadcast nationwide on the new start-up sports network ESPN. Rule and ball changes had drastically reduced the offensive production in the 1979 APSPL season which resulted in a court challenge by the Caesars as team owner Ilitch felt the changes were directed at his team. On Detroit, Ron Ford's home run total dropped from 80 in 1978 to 43 and RBI's from 201 to 122 in the same number of games and Ford still led the league in both categories as batting averages and power production dipped league-wide. Four Caesars took all-league honors (Ron Ford, Mike Nye, Doug Gerdes and Rick Trudeau). Trudeau finished second in the batting race with Nye joining him in the top-10. Ford, Gerdes and Gary Geister finished top-10 in home-runs and RBIs.  New Leagues and the Detroit Auto Kings Instability in other markets and internal political fighting saw two teams (Cleveland and Milwaukee) leave the APSPL to form the North American Softball League (NASL) under the leadership of Cleveland owner (and eventual owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers) Ted Stepien. The APSPL continued with just 6 teams (down from 12 in each of the previous 3 seasons) and Ilitch elected not to continue the Detroit Caesars in either league and folded the Detroit Caesars. The Detroit Auto Kings were formed as part of the new league and also played at Memorial Field. Several Caesars, including Mike Gouin, Dan Murphy, Tony Mazza and Gary Geister, played for the Auto Kings along with former Detroit Tiger Mickey Stanley. The Auto Kings advanced to the playoffs with a 34‚Äì23 record winning the semifinals 4‚Äì1 over Cleveland (6‚Äì4, 8‚Äì7, 19‚Äì4, 5‚Äì10, 14‚Äì5). Detroit would advance to the NASL World Series and lose to the Milwaukee Schlitz 5‚Äì2 (19‚Äì11, 10‚Äì12, 12‚Äì16, 22‚Äì13, 13‚Äì4, 12‚Äì3, 11‚Äì9). Ken Parker of Milwaukee would take the World Series MVP trophy while Ron Olesiak of Chicago was the league MVP. Mike Turk of the Auto Kings was the sole Detroit representative on the 1980 NASL All-Pro team. The NASL and the APSPL merged after the 1980 season to form a new league, the United Professional Softball League (UPSL), and the Auto Kings disbanded. In 1982, a Detroit team (Detroit Softball City) played in the UPSL and was led by Charles Mitchell, along with former Caesars Rick Trudeau, Gary Geister and manager Gary Vitto. Detroit Softball City finished second in the league to the Milwaukee Schlitz with a record of 36‚Äì20 and beat Cleveland 3‚Äì2 in the semi-finals of the playoffs (14‚Äì7, 6‚Äì11, 9‚Äì7, 0‚Äì11, 17‚Äì10). Detroit would lose in the UPSL World Series to Milwaukee 5‚Äì1 (9‚Äì8, 8‚Äì3, 7‚Äì10, 13‚Äì11, 12‚Äì7, 39‚Äì6) with the Schlitz led by World Series MVP Dick Laba. Dana Andry of Cleveland was the UPSL MVP and Charles Mitchell of Detroit made the All-UPSL team. That was the last year for professional softball in the US as players once again returned to amateur leagues.

Its confluence with the Embarras River is located near the town of Ste. Marie in Jasper County. It is a major tributary to the Embarras River. The North Fork's main tributary is Panther Creek, located in Jasper County. The area has seen extensive agriculture and is also an area rich in oil. There are many oil wells and pumps along the river although the peak of oil production in the area occurred in the 1930s. The surrounding area is largely agricultural, and river stages change dramatically due to agricultural runoff. It flows through a mostly wooded corridor and some river bottom farmland. The stream bed is composed mostly of sand with some glacial till, hard clay, and mud. Fallen trees and log jams are common. Pools and rivers may change drastically after heavy flooding. Large sandbars are not uncommon. There is some siltation and mild to extreme bank erosion in areas due to agriculture.

The North Fork's main tributary is named Panther Creek, suggesting that at one time mountain lions may have inhabited the area. Beaver, otter and mink were nearly trapped out in the 1950s and 60s, but all three have made successful comebacks due to less trapping, habitat recovery and reintroductions. Common birds include waterfowl such as wood ducks and wading birds such as great blue herons and sandpipers. The river corridor and surrounding wetlands are important for migrating geese. There are numerous woodpeckers and songbirds. There are several common birds of prey including red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and barred owls. Bald eagles have been sighted. Due to the North Fork's variety of stream bed substrates and gradients, there is a wider variety of fish species than may be found in other streams in the region. Several species of Darters (genus Etheostoma and Percina) are common. Minnows include sand shiners, steelcolor shiners, silverjaw minnows and brook silversides. Blackstripe topminnows and mosquitofish are very common along the margins. Madtoms, bullhead and channel catfish are also common. Several sunfish species including long-eared sunfish, crappie, largemouth bass and spotted bass are also found. Non-game fish such as white suckers, common carp, and long-nosed and short-nosed gar are numerous. The dominant trees along the river's edge are sycamore and cottonwood, along with silver maple, sugar maple, sassafras and mulberry. The surrounding bottomland is dominated by shagbark hickory and white oak. Conservation Over the past few years efforts have been made to cut back on erosion due to agriculture. Less productive bottomland fields are being reverted to brush land and wetlands, and shallow ponds have been created for migrating waterfowl. These improvements to the surrounding landscape will ultimately improve the overall condition and diversity of the system.

He is the founder of three research and training institutes, the author of numerous books and articles, and the inventor of a series of psychometric instruments that provide insight into individual and group behaviors. His groundbreaking empirical research revealed a fundamental structure to all communication, known as Structural Dynamics, which provides the solution to the most common communication challenges experienced in any human system. Kantor's Four Player Model has been referenced by hundreds of other theorists including Peter Senge in The Fifth Discipline,Senge, Peter.

Jossey Bass. 2012. He has taught and trained thousands of students at institutions including Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern University, the Boston Family Institute, the Family Institute of Cambridge, the Kantor Family Institute, and has also been the recipient of multiple grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He is the Founder and Thought Leader of The Kantor Institute. Career David Kantor received his B.A. and M.A. from Brooklyn College in 1950 and 1952, respectively, and received his Ph.D. from Brandeis University in 1963. Beginning in 1956, he was a lecturer at Harvard University's Department of Social Relations. Kantor's innovative research methods while at Harvard included a study of the effects on career choice of students at Phillips Brook house volunteering in mental hospitals; the effects of student volunteers on the culture and behavior of psychiatric patients; and a study of an alternative treatment modality (a virtual family). The third study, creating halfway houses where students lived with and studied patients full-time, and placing healthy students in mental hospitals (disguised as patients) to directly study treatment of patients and the condition of mental hospitals,David Kantor and Milton Greenblatt, ‚ÄúWellmet: Halfway to Community Rehabilitation,‚Äù Mental Hospitals, 13: 146‚Äì52 (March 1962 was captured by Robert Kaiser on the National Educational Television Network - WTTWCross, Robert.\\"In Crazy?\\" Chicago Tribune. September 28, 1969. Retrieved from: http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/09/28/page/227/article/in-crazy His work on the negative effects of institutionalizing patients was instrumental in the movement to shift psychological and psychiatric care toward more effective and beneficial treatment methods where appropriate. After Harvard, Kantor was an Assistant Professor of Clinical psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine from 1965-1975, during which time he also served as first Director of Psychological Research (1966-1969), Director, Center for Training in Family Therapy (1968-1975), and Chief Psychologist (1969-1975) at Boston State Hospital. He also founded the Boston Family Institute in 1967 and the Family Institute of Cambridge in 1974. During this time, Kantor received a grant from the National Institute of Health to study communication patterns in families with schizophrenics. The findings resulted in a theory of face-to-face communication published in Inside the Family in 1975. In 1980 David founded the Kantor Family Institute, a postgraduate training center for therapists and organizational consultants and served as its Director for fifteen years. During this time David expanded his focus on systems theory to include businesses and other organizations, and also developed his ‚ÄúTheory of Theories.‚Äù He also acted as a research consultant to William Isaac's Dialogue Project at the Organizational Learning Center of the MIT Sloan School of Management. Kantor's next book resulted from a study that applied systems theory to intimate relationships, My Lover, Myself (1999). An important construct‚Äîa typology of three types of heroic behaviors in response to crisis‚Äîemerged from this study and is gaining traction among organizational researchers and practitioners. In 2001, Kantor joined Monitor Group to develop a new model and theory of leadership focused on the development of senior executives. One of the products of this collaboration was the Leadership Model Building (LMB) program utilized by both Monitor's senior leadership and significant clients. From 2001 through 2008, David was the leader of Monitor Kantor Enterprises (MKE), a business unit whose products helped clients develop the necessary organizational leadership and team dynamics capabilities to execute their organizations‚Äô strategies. Clients cited MKE's products and approach as highly influential and essential in helping them make critical decisions and successfully navigate some of their business's most extreme challenges. Current work Between 2008 and 2011, Kantor continued his thought leadership and research in order to upgrade his concepts to new levels of theoretical credibility. This work is captured in the book, Reading the Room: Group Dynamics for Coaches and Leaders, published in 2012 by Jossey- Bass/Wiley. Reading the Room won a bronze Axiom Business Book award in 2013 in the communications category. In 2014, Kantor, launched The Kantor Institute to make consulting tools and products based on Structural Dynamics available to trained practitioners. The Kantor Institute has embarked on a quantitative research study with The Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology to empirically demonstrate the efficacy of his theory in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of teams. As a part of this effort, a new generation of practitioners is being trained in real-time coding of the underlying structure of communication and thereby producing measurable data that can be tracked over time. Personal life Kantor is married to Meredith Otis and is the father of seven children (five biological and two step- children). He lives in Cambridge, MA. In a show of his playful side, while teaching at Harvard College in the 1960s, he ran a mobile bookstand, an A frame housing ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs hundred best books,‚Äù in Harvard Square that was pulled behind a donkey. Jenny, the donkey, was housed at the Cambridge Readeasy, a site that is now the Charles Hotel.

The Science museum is an old house. The museum present few collections as mineralogy and geology collections and more History In 2006, after years of protests by animal rights groups, Split Zoo decided to relocate all of its exotic animals and stop accepting new ones. Nevertheless, the miserable situation for the animals has not changed and animal protection groups in Croatia receive countless complaints by shocked tourists on a regular basis. In 2014 the zoo announced that it will be closing and relocating all animals. In June 2015, after the closing of the museum and zoo in 2014, an artists collective founded by artist Hrvoje Cokarich from Split decided to help the left over animals. Finding that people/governments don't like to take care of humans, animals or things that have no purpose (like donkeys being replaced by cars), they are trying to find new purpose for the animals. This way they hope that either because of the publicity and/or the use / profit of the new purpose the people and city government will see the purpose and therefore also feel the need to take care of the animals. Ever since 2016, artists come up with alternative purpose to avoid extinction of the animals. (Inter)national artists are invited to actually apply to do a week long residency at the zoo and make a project with/for the donkeys. Artists that participated in the project so far are: Hrvoje Cokaric, Vanja Pagar, Darko Skrobonja, Ranko Smoljan, Petar Pecur, Ronald Panza, Matija Habijanec, Igor Milhovilovic, Matea Munitic Mihovilovic, Ivo Poderzaj, Dragan Dokic, Ivan Svagusa, Tomislav Miljak, Ivo Jerkunica, Darvin Butkovic, Marko Brecelj, Zoran Kelava and Nela Sisaric. Marijan is a gorgeous silent green space / park the size of approx. 300 square kilometer (similar to Central Park in NYC) it's a small mountain the city of Split is wrapped around. There are no cars, no horeca, just nature and art. It is where people run, bike, and just chill enjoying the great views. It gives not only the citizens but also the tourists some peace and quiet from the 24H vibrant alive city down the mountain at the sea. You can either bike up the mountain, take a small train that leaves from the city just outside the old palace in front of the Museum of Fine Arts, or you can take stairs that go all the way up the mountain to where the zoo is, with benches and viewpoints on the way up (or down).

Large number of Chakmas also fell into the PLRC‚Äôs geographic boundary. However, the PLRC could not function from day one. The main reason was that there was no common language among the three tribal communities namely Chakma, Mara and Lai which they could understand. The first meeting was reportedly held without understanding each other‚Äôs language. Mizo was used as official language but Chakmas and Maras could hardly understand anything, and ultimately in 1958 the Maras decided to boycott the Regional Council‚Äôs meetings.

Jewish tradition teaches that anyone on a mission of good deeds will be saved from harm, and so, on each trip, Siegel followed this age-old custom and asked friends and relatives for a dollar or two to give away to Tzedakah upon his arrival in the Holy Land. Once in Israel, Siegel went in search of \\"the Good People\\" (he refers to them as \\"Mitzvah Heroes\\"), ordinary Israelis who were doing extraordinary work, by simply in trying to make the world a better place. Within a short time, he learned of the efforts of such people as Hadassah Levi, who made her life's work the rescue of abandoned babies with Down syndrome from hospitals, Myriam Mendilow, who found Jerusalem's poor, elderly residents on the streets of the city and gave them respect and new purpose in her program, Yad L'Kashish (Lifeline for the Old), or Uri Lupolianski, a young teacher who started Israel's now famous lending program, Yad Sarah, in his living room. He has found these \\"Mitzvah heroes\\" in countless places around the world. And his challenge to everyone is that he \\"wants to turn ordinary people into superheroes\\". Siegel works with over 100 such altruists around the world. He \\"has a stable of everyday, real-life Mitzvah heroes, young and old, with projects ranging from the ordinary to the unusual\\". After returning from his first trip, Siegel issued a four-page report to all of his donors in which he described all of the places that he had distributed their Tzedakah money. From that first $955 Siegel collected and gave away, Ziv has grown to an organization that in 2007 completed its 32nd year of operation and has distributed more than $14,000,000 primarily to small programs and projects in both Israel and the United States. (In 2006, over $2,000,000 was given away to people in need; and the same for 2007-8). Siegel has decided to retire from the active running of Ziv Tzedakah Fund, and Ziv has closed its doors as of December 2008. Siegel influenced thousands of people with his unique tzedakah and mitzvah philosophy. With the closing of Ziv Tzedakah Fund in 2008, Siegel identified several other organizations in his final report to donors. All of these groups operate in a similar manner as Ziv and they include Hands on Tzedakah, the Mitzvah Heroes Fund, started by Siegel's students (Steve Kerbel, Bill Begal, and Mary Meyerson) and continues Siegel's long-standing tradition of employing someone in Israel, on the ground choosing Arnie Draiman as the Director for Israel Projects Draiman worked for Siegel for over 15 years and continues to work closely with him today); KAVOD, Tzedakah Fund, Inc., To Save A Life Foundation and The Good People Fund. His approach to Tzedakah \\"offers a no frills, no red tape way to help those in need\\", according to the San Diego Jewish Journal. Siegel has a B.S. in Comparative Literature from Columbia University's School of General Studies, and a Bachelor's and Master's of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He is one of three recipients of the prestigious 1993 Covenant Award for Exceptional Jewish Educators. Literary career Siegel is the author of 29 books on such topics as practical and personalized giving, healing and humor, and has produced an anthology of 500 selections of Biblical and Talmudic quotes about living life called Where Heaven and Earth Touch. Siegel is also a poet and several of his published books are poetry. In 2020, the Jewish Publication Society published an anthology of Siegel's writings, 'Radiance: Creative Mitzvah Living, The Selected Prose and Poetry of Danny Siegel, edited by Rabbi Neal Gold and with a foreword by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin.''

The Auto Kings roster featured five members of Detroit Caesar teams - outfielder Dan Murphy, third-baseman Gary Geister, outfielder Mike Gouin, first-baseman Cal Carmen, and pitcher Tony Mazza. Mike Gouin also served as team manager. Two teams came to the newly formed NASL from the APSPL - the Cleveland Competitors, owned by Ted Stepien, NASL President and then owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, along with the APSPL champion Milwaukee Schlitz. Former MLB players Mudcat Grant and Joe Pepitone served as PR officials for the league. Pepitone was a former player for the Trenton franchise in the APSPL. Continuing the Caesars tradition of former Detroit Tigers turning to play professional softball, the Auto Kings featured former Detroit Tigers outfielder Mickey Stanley. The only two Auto Kings to appear in the top-ten categories were Gary Geister, who finished 5th in the NASL with 31 home-runs, while teammate Jerry Gadette finished 10th with 24. 3B/SS Mike Turk was the only Auto King to receive all- league honors in 1980. 1980 Detroit Auto Kings The Auto Kings advanced to the playoffs with a 34-23 record, winning the semi-finals 4-1 over Cleveland (6-4, 8-7, 19-4, 5-10, 14-5).

Related salts are the dithiophosphate Na3PS2O2.11H2O, trithiophosphate Na3PS3O.11H2O, and tetrathiophosphate Na3PS4.8H2O.

Partial dehydration over 6.5 M H2SO4 gives the nonahydrate. Under flowing N2, the anhydrous salt is formed. Sodium phosphorothiolate decomposes at neutral pH. Silicone grease catalyses the hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate ion, so it is recommended that it is not used in the glass joints. In the anhydrous material, the P-S bond is 211 pm and the three equivalent P-O bonds are short at 151 pm. These disparate values suggest that the P-S bond is single.

Biography Caymmi was born in Rio de Janeiro to parents who were musicians, his father Dorival Caymmi a composer and his mother Stella Maris a singer. When he was eight, he started piano lessons. At the Conservat√≥rio Lorenzo Fernandez, he studied music theory and harmony. He became a professional musician in 1959 when he accompanied his sister Nana in a performance. During the next year, he became a member of Grupo dos Sete and composed music for TV. He directed the play Opini√£o and performed on viol√£o for it in 1964, contributing to the growth of m√∫sica popular brasileira (MPB).

Welch was born in Salt Lake City on November 6, 1925, to Jesse Evard and Pearl Snow Welch. He served in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War. He married Marcelle Beecher in Salt Lake City on March 21, 1951, and together they had six daughters, Megan Hayes, Melinda Bell, Michele Herrscher, Maile Verbica, Marlyse Timmins and Merla Welch. Welch graduated from UCLA with a major in mathematics and minor in music. He continued his music studies at the Paris Conservatory of Music, graduated with a master's degree in composition from Mills College in Oakland, California, and earned a Ph.D. in 1959 from the University of Utah, where he taught for 39 years before retiring in 1993. Besides teaching music theory and other classes to music majors, Welch taught music appreciation to thousands of non-majors. In 2004, the University of Utah's Emeritus Alumni Association awarded him the prestigious Merit of Honor Award. In 1957, Welch was named assistant conductor to Richard Condie, the music director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

Sootiness is presumed to be an inherited trait, though the precise genetic mechanism, or series of mechanisms, is not well understood. In most cases, sooty coats exhibit pronounced countershading; the dorsal region is darker than the ventral region. However, some forms seem to produce darker lower parts. The \\"false dorsal\\" or \\"countershading dorsal\\" can mimic the dorsal stripe associated with dun horses and is associated with the sooty trait. The most extensive expression of sooty produces a dark, often-dappled cast oriented down from the topline. Many horses with the sooty trait have a darker mask on the bony parts of the face. It was once thought that the sooty trait was responsible for turning chestnut into liver chestnut, however it is not known to evenly darken the coat. The sooty trait is responsible for many dark bays and has a particularly pronounced effect on buckskins and palominos. Although this trait has been called the \\"sooty gene\\", similar coat-darkening conditions studied in mice suggest that coat darkening is a polygenic trait.

The cell produces energy by combining carbon and oxygen, which releases carbon dioxide as a by-product. It is also called coal fuel cells (CFCs), carbon-air fuel cells (CAFCs), direct carbon/coal fuel cells (DCFCs), and DC-SOFC. The total reaction of the cell is C + O2 ‚Üí CO2.

Audiograms are produced using a piece of test equipment called an audiometer, and this allows different frequencies to be presented to the subject, usually over calibrated headphones, at any specified level. The levels are, however, not absolute, but weighted with frequency relative to a standard graph known as the minimum audibility curve which is intended to represent 'normal' hearing. This is not the best threshold found for all subjects, under ideal test conditions, which is represented by around 0 phon or the threshold of hearing on the equal-loudness contours, but is standardised in an ANSI standard to a level somewhat higher at 1 kHz . There are several definitions of the minimal audibility curve, defined in different international standards, and they differ significantly, giving rise to differences in audiograms according to the audiometer used. The ASA-1951 standard for example used a level of 16.5 dB SPL at 1 kHz whereas the later ANSI-1969/ISO-1963 standard uses 6.5 dB SPL, and it is common to allow a 10 dB correction for the older standard.

Praised by critics for his musicianship, he was particularly associated with roles in operas composed by Mozart, Rossini, and Donizetti.  Life and career  Dino Borgioli was born and died in Florence, where he studied with Eugenio Giachetti. He made his operatic debut in 1914, as Arturo in I puritani, at the Teatro Corso in Milan. He then sang the role of Fernand in La favorite at the Teatro Dal Verme, before making his La Scala debut in 1918 as Ernesto in Don Pasquale. In 1924, he was the lead tenor in the Melba- Williamson Grand Opera tour of Australia, opening the Sydney season opposite Nellie Melba in La boh√®me. On the international scene, Borgioli debuted at the Royal Opera House in London, as Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, opposite Toti Dal Monte in 1925‚Äîand at the Glyndebourne Festival where he sang as Ottavio in Don Giovanni, and as Ernesto. He also appeared in Paris, at both the Op√©ra- Comique and the Palais Garnier, as Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Ramiro in La Cenerentola, the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto, Ottavio, Edgardo and des Grieux in Manon. The role of Cavaradossi in Tosca was his debut role for both the San Francisco Opera in 1932, and the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1933. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on December 31, 1934, as Rodolfo in La boh√®me. Borgioli appeared there for one season only: his other roles were Ottavio and des Grieux (Manon). Recordings Borgioli made a number of gramophone records which confirm the attractiveness of his lyric voice and the elegance of his phrasing. These qualities can be discerned in his two famous near-complete recordings of The Barber of Seville and Rigoletto which he made in 1929 and 1928 respectively for Columbia opposite baritone Riccardo Stracciari under the baton of Lorenzo Molajoli. He was overshadowed, both live and on disc, by another stylish lyric tenore di grazia of that era, Tito Schipa. In 1949 Borgioli became director of vocal studies at the New Opera Company of London, where he directed stage productions of The Barber of Seville and La boh√®me. He died at 69 in his native Florence.  Sources  * D.

It was commissioned on behalf of Dean and Chapter of London's St. Paul's Cathedral by the cathedral's organist, Sir George Martin, as part of a grand service to celebrate the expected British victory in the Boer War.Information from the G&S; Discography The Boer War Te Deum was first performed at St. Paul's Cathedral on June 8, 1902, eight days after the official ending of the war, and 18 months after the deaths of both Sullivan and Queen Victoria.Information on the piece at the G&S; archive The piece was composed for chorus, brass, strings and organ, and features as a recurring theme the melody of Sullivan's hymn tune \\"St. Gertrude\\", his setting for \\"Onward Christian Soldiers.\\"Detailed musical analysis of the Te Deum Laudamus and other Sullivan liturgical music Background Arthur Sullivan became Britain's most famous composer during the late Victorian era, and so he was an obvious choice to compose a piece to celebrate the coming end of the Boer War.Liner notes analyzing and describing the Boer War Te Deum and Sullivan's The Prodigal Son George Martin and Colonel Arthur Collins visited Sullivan in his home on May 26, 1900 to ask him to write the Te Deum. Sullivan wrote in his diary that he consented to try and see what he could do. Sullivan encountered some delays in the course of composing the Te Deum, including a difficult trip to Germany in June 1900. Despite Sullivan's fame and popularity in Germany, the country's attitude toward the Boer War dampened Sullivan's reception. In addition, Sullivan had already committed to working on the comic opera The Emerald Isle for the Savoy Theatre and was forced to put it aside to work on the Te Deum. Sullivan noted in his diary in July 1900 that he was essentially finished with the Te Deum. Soon afterwards, he grew ill, and in October he gave Martin final instructions about staging the work. Sullivan died in November, before he could complete The Emerald Isle, leaving that opera to be finished by his friend Edward German.Information about The Emerald Isle The Te Deum premiered as part of a larger service celebrating the end of the Boer War. King Edward and other members of the Royal family were in attendance. The King and Queen entered the Cathedral to Sullivan's hymn Onward Christian Soldiers. Analysis and criticism St. Paul's Cathedral, where the work premiered and where Sullivan is buried, by order of Queen Victoria The Boer War Te Deum was Sullivan's last-completed major work. The text is the ancient Christian hymn as translated in the Book of Common Prayer, showing Sullivan's \\"personal Christian commitment\\" at the end of his life. In addition, his use of his popular hymn tune, \\"St. Gertrude,\\" throughout the Te Deum is the most prominent self-reference that Sullivan allowed himself in his career, underlining the very personal nature of this final work and his love of his church and country. Benedict Taylor wrote that unlike Sullivan's earlier Festival Te Deum, > the work is relatively subdued, more self-effacing, concise and emotionally > subtly-tinged.... A compact, single movement work of about a quarter-of-an- > hour's duration... [its] musical sections corresponding to the traditional > divisions of the liturgical text run into one another without break. A > degree of unity across the sectional, evolving structure is provided by > cyclic features... and the use of common or related material for successive > sections.... Of possibly even greater structural cohesion is the > pervasiveness of march-like figures throughout the work, principally > rhythmic but often also employing repeated notes or arpeggiac figures > characteristic of the hymn tune 'St Gertrude'.... It is a work whose > grandeur and restrained dignity have made it cherished and esteemed.... Contemporary critics also reviewed the piece favourably. The Daily Telegraph wrote, \\"Then the Service reached its central episode with the Te Deum sung to Sir Arthur Sullivan‚Äôs music, deprived, through the absence of strings, of its full orchestral beauty, but wrought up from exquisite tenderness to a pitch of dignity and strength.\\" Note the reference in the previous quote to the absence of strings: The cathedral was unable to procure a suitable string section, and so the Te Deum was premiered without strings. The Musical Times was also favourably impressed by the piece: > In every page of the score we can trace the hand of the skilled musician, > once a Chorister of the Chapel Royal. Moreover the work is impregnated with > a robustness distinctly national in the directness of its diatonic > expression. The introduction of the composer's familiar hymn tune 'Onward > Christian Soldiers' ‚Äî first in fragments and afterwards in its entirety ‚Äî > infuses a military element into this Thanksgiving Te Deum, the significance > of which is obvious.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1991. The grammatical rules of an affix grammar are those of a context-free grammar, except that certain parts in the nonterminals (the affixes) are used as arguments. If the same affix occurs multiple times in a rule, its value must agree, i.e. it must be the same everywhere. In some types of affix grammar, more complex relationships between affix values are possible.  Example  We can describe an extremely simple fragment of English in the following manner: : Sentence ‚Üí Subject Predicate : Subject ‚Üí Noun : Predicate ‚Üí Verb Object : Object ‚Üí Noun : : Noun ‚Üí John : Noun ‚Üí Mary : Noun ‚Üí children : Noun ‚Üí parents : : Verb ‚Üí like : Verb ‚Üí likes : Verb ‚Üí help : Verb ‚Üí helps This context-free grammar describes simple sentences such as : John likes children : Mary helps John : children help parents : parents like John With more nouns and verbs, and more rules to introduce other parts of speech, a large range of English sentences can be described; so this is a promising approach for describing the syntax of English. However, the given grammar also describes sentences such as : John like children : children helps parents These sentences are wrong: in English, subject and verb have a grammatical number, which must agree. An affix grammar can express this directly: : Sentence -> Subject + number Predicate+number : Subject + number -> Noun + number : Predicate + number -> Verb + number Object : Object -> Noun + number : Noun + singular -> John : Noun + singular -> Mary : Noun + plural -> children : Noun + plural -> parents : : Verb + singular -> likes : Verb + plural -> like : Verb + singular -> helps : Verb + plural -> help This grammar only describes correct English sentences, although it could be argued that : John likes John is still incorrect and should instead read : John likes himself This, too, can be incorporated using affixes, if the means of describing the relationships between different affix values are powerful enough. As remarked above, these means depend on the type of affix grammar chosen.  Types  In the simplest type of affix grammar, affixes can only take values from a finite domain, and affix values can only be related through agreement, as in the example. Applied in this way, affixes increase compactness of grammars, but do not add expressive power. Another approach is to allow affixes to take arbitrary strings as values and allow concatenations of affixes to be used in rules. The ranges of allowable values for affixes can be described with context-free grammar rules. This produces the formalism of two-level grammars, also known as Van Wijngaarden grammars or 2VW grammars. These have been successfully used to describe complicated languages, in particular, the syntax of the Algol 68 programming language. However, it turns out that, even though affix values can only be manipulated with string concatenation, this formalism is Turing complete; hence, even the most basic questions about the language described by an arbitrary 2VW grammar are undecidable in general. Extended Affix Grammars, developed in the 1980s, are a more restricted version of the same idea. They were mainly applied to describe the grammar of natural language, e.g. English. Another possibility is to allow the values of affixes to be computed by code written in some programming language. Two basic approaches have been used: * In attribute grammars, the affixes (called attributes) can take values from arbitrary domains (e.g. integer or real numbers, complex data structures) and arbitrary functions can be specified, written in a language of choice, to describe how affix values in rules are derived from each other. * In CDL (the Compiler Description Language) and its successor CDL2, developed in the 1970s, fragments of source code (usually in assembly language) can be used in rules instead of normal right-hand sides, allowing primitives for input scanning and affix value computations to be expressed directly. Designed as a basis for practical compiler construction, this approach was used to write compilers, and other software, e.g. a text editor.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the surviving population of the Earth has built a new society ruled by a totalitarian government while armed factions fight for resources and power within the new system. Among other features, a few of note are a skill-based advancement system, a player-driven economy and an emphasis on free PvP. The game uses the Earthrise Engine, an engine that was to be used for the cancelled Fallout Online. Citing that the game was released \\"too early\\" and that it \\"did not meet the expectations of its fans\\", Masthead Studios shut down the Earthrise servers on February 9, 2012. A press release was sent to many of the gaming sites along with a post on the official forums giving additional details. The announcement also mentioned that the previously planned conversion to a free-to-play model is now dependent on future investor and/or publisher interest.  Gameplay  = Character progression = The character progression in Earthrise is conducted entirely online. = Skill System = The number 100 indicates total skills, abilities and tactics available at launch. While many of them are combat oriented, a sizable amount will cover crafting and social aspects for each character. The three types of game elements ‚Äì skills, abilities and tactics, are closely related to each other and will allow for numerous possibilities for customization of the character. Tactics are the key to customization ‚Äì these meta-enhancements will be compatible with wide variety of abilities and will change their effects to suit player‚Äôs style of play. Players with similar skills may have a completely different style of fighting thanks to enhancing them with tactics. = Combat = The outcome of battle in Earthrise will rely more on the traditional RPG system, where avatar skills and equipment are important. However the combat will be more dynamic, resembling a third person shooter. The game will require a certain level of player skill in movement and targeting that is becoming increasingly popular trend in current wave of MMOs. Still, not every action will have the same requirements. Some actions will require proper targeting of the opponent, while others will require only having it in sight and then there will be actions that can be executed even if the player doesn‚Äôt have its target in sight but within range. = PvP = Close combat vs ranged weapons, introduced by Earthrises gameplay video Players will have the opportunity to kill other players (including from his faction) ‚Äì but not without consequences. Killing people of the same faction is one of the worst crimes, prosecuted by members of both Noir and Continoma. It will be very difficult for someone to clear the damning effects of such a crime, though not impossible, and his space of operation would be greatly limited in the wild, less secure areas - where he himself would taste his own medicine by being open target for other criminals. Each player's criminal actions, once reported through the Continoma SVS Network will affect the behavior of every guard the player encounters. There will be cases when despite guard activity, the actions do not get reported island-wide. For the most prosecuted player killers that means that their life in a sizable portion of the game world will be constant game of cat and mouse, and other players will certainly benefit from joining in as there will be rewards to take a criminal down. Stealth abilities will be almost a requirement for survival. We won't force that sort of gameplay on players and it would be easy to get on good terms with the government. Player who has killed another player opponent would be able to loot his possessions. There will be available equipment protection, but its viability will vary based on character's affiliation and actions in the game. Characters who play \\"against the system\\" should learn to protect their gear well. There will be some high security areas in Earthrise, where guards will attack on sight everyone else who tries to attack another player. People, who don‚Äôt want to engage in PvP will feel secure in these zones. At the same time, the most dangerous parts of the island will feature free for all PvP. Another PvP aspect in Earthrise will be guild rivalries. Guilds will be able to declare war on each other and fight for power and resources. Such wars will be prohibited in the security zones, but will not be punished in the other territories. Guilds will be able to conquer their own part of the island, gaining access to resources and a territory where they can impose their rules. There will also be arenas and other types of PvP competitions with rewards. People who do not want to engage in PvP will not feel alienated in Earthrise. There will be certain areas in the game, where PvE skills will be more important than PvP. Quests, crafting and trade are other examples of the non- PvP gameplay in Earthrise. = Crafting = Crafting in Earthrise is a complex process that is easy to understand but ultimately difficult to master. The basic rule of crafting is that every item is made of components and every item can be broken down to its composites. Some components are used for specific items, others are used in a wide array of items ‚Äì for example, a hand gun grip can be used in the creation of various hand guns, while electronic chipsets can be used to create specific devices. Players often will break down items to their components in order to combine some of them with other components to produce new, different items. Crafting and salvaging requires specific skills, depending what item is created or salvaged down, and players will have access to dozens of skills, covering mechanics, electronics, engineering, construction and programming in several futuristic industries. Transformation of one type of item to another - either through crafting or salvaging - has damaging effect on the used resources and the final item will always have lowered quality value compared to the input components, depending on player's crafting skill. This renders impossible the infinite transformation of items - even for a true expert, constant crafting and salvaging of the same item will make the resources useless and any item made of them prone to quick damage and lessened effect. This is when items will \\"break\\" completely - when they cannot be any more repaired, or effectively salvaged to craft a new useful item. Critical reception MMORPG.com rated the game 5.5/10 and wrote that the game was bland and uninspired, lacking a true sandbox environment and offering \\"little more than grinding combat and crafting\\" while also noting that the game suffered from performance issues. GameFront rated the game 65/100, praising the game's art direction but stated that the game offered slow progression and lacked a sizable playerbase.

In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011, Gallot received 12,992 votes (50.3 percent). Trailing was the Republican Tony \\"Bo\\" Vets, with 7,579 votes (29.3 percent) and Democrat Mary L. Wardsworth, with 5,271 votes (20.4 percent). Gallot, an African American born in Ruston, graduated from the historically black Grambling State University in Grambling and the Southern University Law Center of Baton Rouge. He is an inductee of the Southern Law Hall of Fame. In 2012, he succeeded the term-limited white Democratic Senator Joe McPherson of Woodworth in southern Rapides Parish, who had represented a different configuration of the district. From 2000 to 2012, Gallot held the District 11 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives. That district was established after the 1990 U.S. census to guarantee a black voter majority. Gallot won the position after the popular incumbent Pinkie C. Wilkerson of Grambling in western Lincoln Parish was killed on August 1, 2000, in a six-vehicle accident on Interstate 20 in Bossier City. At the time of her death, Wilkerson, committed to the Gore/Lieberman ticket, had been scheduled two weeks thereafter as a delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. In the 2007 primary, Gallot handily defeated the sister of Pinkie Wilkerson to win his third term in the legislative chamber. Despite a generally liberal voting record, in 2014 Gallot was one of only two Democrats in the State Senate to vote against reforming Louisiana's payday lending laws, having sided with the payday lending industry against a grassroots campaign that supported reform. He was rated 43 percent in 2014 by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gallot voted 100 percent with the Louisiana Right to Life Committee in 2009 and 2014 but 67 percent in 2013 and 45 percent in 2008. Gallot did not seek reelection in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 24, 2015. Joshua Joy Dara, Sr. (born March 1959), a Republican Baptist minister and lawyer from Pineville, and Alexandria attorney Jay Luneau, a Democrat, ran to succeed Gallot. Luneau prevailed with 59 percent of the ballots cast. In April 2016, Gallot began serving on the Board of Directors of Cleco Corporation, an electric utility company based in Pineville, Louisiana. Gallot was selected as president of Grambling State University and to begin his tenure, donated $20,000 to the institution noting, \\"I wouldn't ask anyone to do what I wouldn't do myself.\\" Gallot is a member of the Gamma Psi chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

This was the nation's first ever appearance in an Olympic Game. The delegation included two track and field athletes and one weightlifter. Okilani Tinilau and Asenate Manoa participated in athletics while Logona Esau participated in the weightlifting sport. Both track and field athletes achieved national records. Logona Esau led the Tuvaluan squad as the nation's flag bearer in the parade of nations. Background The nation of Tuvalu is a Polynesian island nation, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, located in the Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia. A former colony of Great Britain, the island nation became fully independent within The Commonwealth in 1978. The nation had a population of 11,992 as of 2008. Tuvalu's international participation in sports has been limited, however weightlifter Logona Esau won the nation's first international competition medal during the Pacific Mini Games in 2005, when he won the bronze. He was later awarded a silver medal at the 2007 Pacific Games. The Tuvalu Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee was formed in 2004, and gained International Olympic Committee recognition in 2007 during the IOC's meetings in Guatemala City.\\"Tuvalu sends three athletes to Beijing\\" , Xinhua, 19 July 2008 The nine small islands that constitute Tuvalu own its own sports infrastructure. However, the nation has eleven active federations of national sports. Included in federation are the following Olympic sports: badminton, basketball, volleyball, weightlifting, tennis and table tennis. The admittance of Tuvalu, along with Montenegro (who participated as Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Summer Olympics) and Marshall Islands brought the total number of nations competing in the 2008 Olympics to 205. The members of the Tuvaluan team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were Logona Esau and two competitors in the woman's and men's 100 metre sprint. The two runners were Asenate Manoa, who also was the nation's first female Olympian, and Okilani Tinilau. Both runners trained in Suva, Fiji alongside members of the Fiji national team.\\"Manoa makes Olympic history for tiny Tuvalu\\" , ABC Radio Australia, 17 July 2008 Athletics Asenate \\"Nancy\\" Manoa competed for Tuvalu in the Beijing Olympics as part of the women's 100 metres races. Born in Fiji, Manoa was 16 years old when she first competed in Beijing; she had not previously competed at any Olympic Games. Manoa previously trained on Funafuti International Airport's runway until continuing her training in Fiji; her competition in Beijing marked both her Olympic d√©but and the first time she ever used starting blocks or competed on a synthetic track. During the August 15 qualification round, Manoa competed in the second heat against seven other athletes. She finished the event in 14.05 seconds, placing last in the event; Manoa was directly behind Pakistan's Sadaf Siddiqui (12.41 seconds) and Iraq's Dana Abdulrazak (12.36 seconds) in a heat led by France's Christine Arron (11.37 seconds) and the American runner Lauryn Williams (11.38 seconds). Of the 85 competitors, Asenate Manoa ranked 83rd. She did not advance to later rounds. Both her and Tinilau qualified for the event via universality placement. Okilani Tinilau represented Tuvalu in the men's 100 meters. Okilani Tinilau was the only male athlete from Tuvalu who competed in a track and field event, representing the country in the men's 100 metres races at the Beijing Olympics. He was born in January 1989, and was 19 years old at the time of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Tinilau had not previously competed at any Olympic Games. During the course of the races, which took place during August 14, Tinilau competed in the tenth heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.48 seconds, placing last in the event. he was directly behind Chad's Moumi S√©bergu√© (11.14 seconds), who placed seventh; and Gabon's Wilfried Bingangoye (10.87 seconds), who placed sixth. The heat itself was led by Dutch Antilean athlete Churandy Martina (10.35 seconds) and Japanese runner Naoki Tsukahara (10.39 seconds). Of the 80 competitors in the event, Tinilau ranked 77th and did not advance to later rounds. ;Men {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90% |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=2|Heat !colspan=2|Quarterfinal !colspan=2|Semifinal !colspan=2|Final |-style=font-size:95% !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Okilani Tinilau |align=left|100 m |11.48 '''''' |8 |colspan=6|Did not advance |} ;Women {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90% |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=2|Heat !colspan=2|Quarterfinal !colspan=2|Semifinal !colspan=2|Final |-style=font-size:95% !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Asenate Manoa |align=left|100 m |14.05 '''''' |8 |colspan=6|Did not advance |} Weightlifting Logona Esau qualified for weightlifting via an invitation from the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class. Born in the South Pacific island nation of Nauru in 1987, Esau was 21 years old at the time of his participation in his Beijing event. He was the most experienced and decorated of the three Tuvaluan athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania in that particular competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102 kilograms, 107 kilograms, and 110 kilograms successively. During the clean and jerks, Esau successfully lifted 138 kilograms, then 144 kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148 kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254 kilograms. This ranked the Tuvaluan in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250 kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268 kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after lifting a combined 348 kilograms. {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90% !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=2|Snatch !colspan=2|Clean & Jerk !rowspan=2|Total !rowspan=2|Rank |-style=font-size:95% !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Logona Esau |align=left|Men's ‚àí69 kg |110 |29 |144 |23 |254 |23 |} References Olympics Nations at the 2008 Summer Olympics 2008 ","title":"Tuvalu at the 2008 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"16111258","text":"Club Sportive Duguwolofila de Koulikoro is a Malian football club.

The Edinburgh Society was the first and foremost phrenology grouping in Great Britain; more than forty phrenological societies followed in other parts of the British Isles. The Society's influence was greatest over the next two decades but declined in the 1840s; the final meeting was recorded in 1870. The central concept of phrenology is that the brain is the organ of the mind and that human behaviour can be usefully understood in broadly neuropsychological rather than philosophical or religious terms. Phrenologists rejected supernatural explanations and stressed the modularity of mind. The Edinburgh phrenologists acted as midwives to evolutionary theory and also inspired a renewed interest in psychiatric disorder and its moral treatment. Phrenology claimed to be scientific but is now regarded as a pseudoscience as its formal procedures did not conform to the usual standards of scientific method. Edinburgh phrenologists included George and Andrew Combe; asylum doctor and reformer William A.F. Browne, father of James Crichton-Browne; Robert Chambers, author of the 1844 proto-Darwinian book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation; William Ballantyne Hodgson, economist and pioneer of women's education; astronomer John Pringle Nichol; and botanist and evolutionary thinker Hewett Cottrell Watson. Charles Darwin, a medical student in Edinburgh in 1825‚Äì7, took part in phrenological discussions at the Plinian Society and returned to Edinburgh in 1838 when formulating his concepts concerning natural selection. Background Phrenology emerged from the views of the medical doctor and scientific researcher Franz Joseph Gall in 18th- century Vienna. Gall suggested that facets of the mind corresponded to regions of the brain, and that it was possible to determine character traits by examining the shape of a person's skull. This \\"craniological\\" aspect was greatly extended by his one-time disciple, Johann Spurzheim, who coined the term phrenology and saw it as a means of advancing society by social reform (improving the material conditions of human life). In 1815, the Edinburgh Review published a hostile article by anatomist John Gordon, who called phrenology a \\"mixture of gross errors\\" and \\"extravagant absurdities\\". In response, Spurzheim went to Edinburgh to take part in public debates and to perform brain dissections in public. Whilst he was received politely by the scientific and medical community there, many were troubled by the philosophical materialism inherent in phrenology.Kaufman (2005), p. 2. George Combe, a lawyer who had previously been skeptical, became a convert to phrenology after listening to Spurzheim's commentary as he dissected a human brain. Founding and function George Combe, founder of the society, was a lawyer who devoted his later life to advancing phrenology around the world. The Edinburgh Phrenological Society was founded on 22 February 1820, by the Combe brothers with the support of the Evangelical minister David Welsh. The Society grew rapidly; in 1826, it had 120 members, an estimated one third of whom had a medical background. The Society acquired large numbers of phrenological artefacts, such as marked porcelain heads indicating the location of cerebral organs, and endocranial casts of individuals with unusual personalities. Their museum was located on Chambers Street. Members published articles, gave lectures, and defended phrenology. Critics included philosopher Sir William Hamilton and the editor of the Edinburgh Review, Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey. The hostility of other critics, including Alexander Monro tertius, anatomy professor at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, actually added to the glamour of phrenological concepts. Some anti- religionists, including the anatomist Robert Knox and the evolutionist Robert Edmond Grant, while sympathetic to its philosophical materialism, rejected the unscientific nature of phrenology and did not embrace its speculative and reformist aspects. In 1823, Andrew Combe addressed the Royal Medical Society in a debate, arguing that phrenology explained the intellectual and moral abilities of mankind. Both sides claimed victory after the lengthy debate, but the Medical Society refused to publish an account. This prompted the Edinburgh Phrenological Society to establish its own journal in 1824: The Phrenological Journal and Miscellany, later renamed Phrenological Journal and Magazine of Moral Science. In the mid-1820s, a split emerged between the Christian phrenologists and Combe's closer associates. Matters came to a head when Combe and his supporters passed a motion banning the discussion of theology in the Society, effectively silencing their critics. In response, David Welsh and other evangelical members left the Society.Kaufman (2005), p. 93. In December 1826, the atheistic phrenologist William A.F. Browne caused a sensation at the University's Plinian Society with an attack on the recently republished theories of Charles Bell concerning the expression of the human emotions. Bell held that human anatomy uniquely allowed the expression of the human moral self while Browne argued that there were no absolute distinctions between human and animal anatomy. Charles Darwin, then a 17-year-old student at the University, was there to listen. On 27 March 1827, Browne advanced phrenological theories concerning the human mind in terms of the Lamarckist evolution of the brain. This attracted the opposition of almost all members of the Plinian Society and, again, Darwin observed the ensuing outrage. In his private notebooks, including the M Notebook written ten years later, Darwin commented sympathetically on the views of the phrenologists. George Combe published The Constitution of Man in 1828. It became an international bestseller in the 19th century, with around 350,000 copies sold. Almost a century later, psychiatrist Sir James Crichton-Browne said of the book: \\"The Constitution of Man on its first appearance was received in Edinburgh with an odium theologicum, analogous to that afterwards stirred up by the Vestiges of Creation and On The Origin of Species. It was denounced as an attack on faith and morals.... read today, it must be regarded as really rather more orthodox in its teaching than some of the lucubrations of the Dean of St Paul's and the Bishop of Durham\\". Phrenologists from the Society applied their methods to the Burke and Hare murders in Edinburgh. Over the course of ten months in 1828, Burke and Hare murdered sixteen people and sold the bodies for dissection in the private anatomy schools. Burke was executed on 28 January 1829, while Hare turned King's evidence; Burke was publicly dissected by Professor Monro the next day, and the phrenologists were permitted to examine his skull. Face masks of both men - a death-mask for Burke and a life-mask for Hare - form part of the Edinburgh phrenology collection. Scotswoman Agnes Sillars Hamilton made a living from phrenology travelling throughout Britain and Ireland. It was her son who left for Australia and published an account of Ned Kelly's skull. Society co-founder and president Andrew Combe had two successful publications in the early 1830s: Observations on Mental Derangement in 1831 and Physiology applied to Health and Education in 1834.Bettany, 1887. The latter, especially, sold well in Great Britain and the United States, with numerous editions and reprintings. The Edinburgh Phrenological Society received a financial boost by the death of a wealthy supporter in 1832. William Ramsay Henderson left a large bequest to the Edinburgh Society to promote phrenology as it saw fit. The Henderson Trust enabled the Society to publish an inexpensive edition of The Constitution of Man, which went on to become one of the best selling books of the 19th Century.Kaufman (2005). However, despite the widespread interest in phrenology in the 1820s and 1830s, the Phrenological Journal always struggled to make a profit. Influences from the Society W.A.F. Browne: In 1832‚Äì1834, Browne published a paper in The Phrenological Journal in three serialised episodes On Morbid Manifestations of the Organ of Language, as connected with Insanity, relating mental disorder to a disturbance in the neurological organization of language. Browne went on to a distinguished career as an asylum doctor and his internationally influential 1837 publication What Asylums Were, Are and Ought To Be was dedicated to Andrew Combe. In 1866, after his twenty years of leadership at The Crichton asylum in Dumfries, Browne was elected President of the Medico-Psychological Association. In his later years, Browne returned to relationships of psychosis, brain injury and language in his 1872 paper Impairment of Language, The Result of Cerebral Disease, published in the West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports, edited by his son James Crichton-Browne. Robert Chambers: Although not formally admitted to the Society, Chambers occasionally acted as George Combe's publisher and became an enthusiast for phrenological thinking. In 1844, Chambers anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, written as he recovered from depression at his holiday home in St Andrews. Chambers' wife, Anne Kirkwood, transcribed the manuscript for the publishers (dictated by her husband) so that they would not recognise its origins. In a strange parallel, Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria in the Summer of 1845. It became an international bestseller and a powerful public influence, situated midway between Combe's The Constitution of Man (1828) and Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859. Charles Darwin: Darwin attended the University of Edinburgh Medical School and, as an active member of Plinian Society, observed the 1826-1827 controversies with phrenologist William A.F. Browne. In 1838, some eleven years after his hurried departure, Darwin revisited Edinburgh and his undergraduate haunts, recording his psychological speculations in the M Notebook and teasing out the details of his theory of natural selection. At this time, Darwin was preparing for marriage with his religiously minded cousin Emma Wedgwood, and was in some emotional turmoil: on 21 September, after his return to England, he recorded a vivid and disturbing dream in which he seemed to be involved in an execution at which the corpse came to life and claimed to have died as a hero. Darwin committed his \\"gigantic blunder\\" concerning the parallel roads of Glen Roy while on this Scottish trip, suggesting an element of mental distraction. He published On the Origin of Species some twenty years later, in 1859; the book was translated into many languages, and became a staple scientific text and a key fixture of modern scientific culture. William Ballantyne Hodgson: Hodgson joined the phrenology movement as a student at Edinburgh University and later supported himself as a hired lecturer for literature, education, and phrenology. He became an educational reformer, a pioneering proponent of women's education and - in 1871 - the first Professor of Political Economy (and Mercantile Law) at Edinburgh University. In later life, Hodgson lived at Bonaly Tower outside Edinburgh, and was elected President of the Educational Institute of Scotland. Thomas Laycock: Laycock was one of George Combe's \\"influential disciples\\". He was a pioneering neurophysiologist. In 1855, Laycock was appointed to the Chair of Medicine in Edinburgh University. In 1860, Laycock published his Mind and Brain, an extended essay on the neurological foundations of psychological life. Laycock was friendly with asylum reformer William A.F. Browne and was an important influence on Browne's son, Sir James Crichton-Browne. John Pringle Nichol: Nichol was originally educated and licensed as a preacher, but the impact of phrenological thinking pushed him into education. He became a famous lecturer and Regius Professor of Astronomy in Glasgow University, and his 1837 book The Architecture of the Heavens was a classic of popular science. In the 1840s, Nichol became addicted to prescription opiates, and he recorded his successful hydropathic rehabilitation in his autobiographical correspondence Memorials from Ben Rhydding. Hewett Cottrell Watson: In 1836, Watson published a paper in The Phrenological Journal entitled What Is The Use Of The Double Brain? in which he speculated on the differential development of the two human cerebral hemispheres. This theme of cerebral asymmetry was picked up rather casually by the London society physician Sir Henry Holland in 1840, and then much more extensively by the eccentric Brighton medical practitioner Arthur Ladbroke Wigan in his 1844 treatise A New View of Insanity: On the Duality of MindMcGilchrist , Iain (2009) The Master and his Emissary New Haven and London: Yale University Press, see especially pages 16 and 60. Ambitious and sweeping interpretation of western culture and civilization in terms of an asymmetric neurology of mind.. It did not achieve scientific status until Paul Broca, encouraged by the French phrenologist/physician Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, published his research into the speech centres of the brain in 1861. In 1868, Broca presented his findings at the Norwich meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1889, Henry Maudsley published a searching review of this topic entitled The Double Brain in the philosophical journal Mind. Like Robert Chambers, Watson later turned his energies to the question of the transmutation of species, and, having bought the Phrenological Journal with the proceeds of a large inheritance, appointed himself as its editor in 1837. In the 1850s, Watson conducted an extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin concerning the geographical distribution of British plant species, and Darwin made generous acknowledgement of Watson's scientific assistance in On The Origin of Species (second edition). Watson was unusual amongst phrenologists in explicitly disavowing phrenological ideas in later life. Decline Interest in phrenology declined in Edinburgh in the 1840s. Some of the phrenologists' concerns drifted into the related fields of anthropometry, psychiatry and criminology, and also into degeneration theory as set out by B√©n√©dict Morel, Arthur de Gobineau and Cesare Lombroso. In the 1870s, the eminent social psychologist Gustav Le Bon (1841-1931) invented a cephalometer which facilitated the measurement of cranial capacity and variation. In 1885, the German medical scientist Rudolf Virchow launched a large scale craniometric investigation of the supposed racial stereotypes with decisively negative results for the proponents of racial science. Worldwide, interest in phrenology remained high throughout the nineteenth century, with George Combe's The Constitution of Man being much in demand. Combe devoted his later years to international travel, lecturing on phrenology. He was preparing the ninth edition of The Constitution of Man when he died while receiving hydrotherapy treatment at Moor Park, Farnham. The last recorded meeting of the Society took place in 1870.Kaufman (2005), p. 86. The Society's museum closed in 1886. Legacy of the Society Together with mesmerism, Winter, Alison (1998) Mesmerized: Powers of Mind in Victorian Britain Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press. phrenology exerted an extraordinary influence on the Victorian literary imagination towards the end of the 19th century, especially in the fin-de-si√®cle aesthetic, and comparable to the later cultural influences of spiritualism and psychoanalysis. Examples of phrenology's literary legacy feature in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, George du Maurier, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson and H.G. Wells. On 29 February 1924, Sir James Crichton-Browne (the son of William A.F. Browne) delivered the Ramsay Henderson Bequest Lecture entitled The Story of the Brain in which he recorded a generous appreciation of the role of the Edinburgh phrenologists in the later development of neurology and neuropsychiatry. Crichton-Browne did not remark, however, on his father's having joined the Society a century earlier, almost to the day. The Henderson Trust was wound up in 2012. Many of the society's phrenological artefacts survive today, having passed to the University of Edinburgh's Anatomical Museum under the guidance of Professor Matthew Kaufman. The activities of the Edinburgh phrenologists have enjoyed an unusual afterlife as a case-study in the history and sociology of scientific knowledge (science studies), as a discarded cultural artefact.

While all employees of the agency contribute to the National Park Service mission of preserving unimpaired the natural and cultural resources set aside by the American people for future generations, the term \\"park ranger\\" is traditionally used to describe all National Park Service employees who wear the uniform. Broadly speaking, all National Park Service rangers promote stewardship of the resources in their care‚Äîeither voluntary stewardship via resource interpretation, or compliance with statute or regulation through law enforcement. These comprise the two main disciplines of the ranger profession in the National Park Service. History The term \\"ranger\\" is from a Middle English word dating back to 1350‚Äì1400. \\"Rangers\\" patrolled royal forests and parks to prevent \\"poachers\\" from hunting game claimed by the nobility. Use of the term \\"ranger\\" dates to the 17th century in the United States, and was drawn from the word \\"range\\" (to travel over a large area). The title \\"ranger\\" in the modern sense was first applied to a reorganization of the fire warden force in the Adirondack Park, after fires burned in the park. The name was taken from Rogers' Rangers, a small force famous for their woodcraft that fought in the area during the French and Indian War beginning in 1755. The term was then adopted by the National Park Service.Angus, Christopher, The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty, Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2002. . The first Director of the National Park Service, Stephen T. Mather, reflected upon the early park rangers in the US National Parks as follows: > They are a fine, earnest, intelligent, and public-spirited body of men, > these rangers. Though small in number, their influence is large. Many and > long are the duties heaped upon their shoulders. If a trail is to be blazed, > it is \\"send a ranger.\\" If an animal is floundering in the snow, a ranger is > sent to pull him out; if a bear is in the hotel, if a fire threatens a > forest, if someone is to be saved, it is \\"send a ranger.\\" If a Dude wants to > know the why, if a Sagebrusher is puzzled about a road, it is \\"ask the > ranger.\\" Everything the ranger knows, he will tell you, ex-cept about > himself. Horace Albright, second director of the National Park Service, called Harry Yount, gamekeeper of Yellowstone National Park, the \\"father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger\\". Yount was hired in 1880 to enforce the prohibition on hunting in the park. In addition to these duties, he would act as a guide and escort for visiting officials, such as he did in 1880 for the Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz. Although he was paid a yearly salary of $1,000 (out of the park's overall $15,000 yearly budget) he resigned at the end of 1881. Before leaving, he suggested to the superintendent of Yellowstone that \\"...the game and natural curiosities of the park be protected by officers stationed at different points of the park with authority to enforce observance of laws of the park maintenance and trails.\\" Yount pointed out that it was nearly impossible for one person to protect the game properly over the park's vast expanse. Official classification The park ranger position in the federal government began as a series of specialized positions in the miscellaneous series. In 1959, the official park ranger position (GS-0025 Park Ranger) was established throughout the federal government.Position Classification Standard for Park Ranger Series, GS-0025; Office of Personnel Management; TS-75 November 1985 along with its companion series the park technician (GS-0026). The park ranger position was designated for \\"professional\\" work like management of the park (park ranger (manager)-park ranger (site manager)), or management of division (chief ranger, chief of interpretation). The park technician series was designed to handle routine technical skills, i.e., giving walks, talks, patrolling roads, fee collection. After years of concern of pay, the National Park Service and the Office of Personnel Management agreed to consolidate the two series into a single group, to be used only for professional positions and temporary or seasonal positions. The agreement also required that the park service begin using other appropriate technical series for lower paid positions. The protection ranger series was changed to \\"GL\\"-0025 in 2005. *0025 ‚Äì park ranger series ‚Äì The duties are to supervise, manage, and perform work in the conservation and use of federal park resources.

Regardless of the regular duties of any one discipline, the goal of all rangers remains to protect the park resources for future generations and to protect park visitors. This goal is accomplished by the professionalism and sometimes overlapping of the different functions and specialties. For example, an interpretive ranger may be trained in and perform fire suppression, emergency medicine, or search and rescue. Law enforcement rangers and other park employees may contribute to the mission of the interpretive ranger by helping park visitors make a personal connection to park resources, and appropriately utilize facilities. The spirit of teamwork in accomplishing the mission of stewardship is underscored by the fact that in many cases, the U.S. National Park Service in particular, park rangers share a common uniform regardless of work assignment. The oldest source of information on park ranger careers was the 1956 Park Ranger by C. B. Colby. At that time, park rangers fulfilled all the demands of park operations from administrative duties to technical rescue. By 1995, Exploring Careers in the National Parks by Bob Gartner, reflected the specialization of duties and the expansion of titles covering the same work as was being done in 1956. In the 21st century, Live the Adventure, showed the park ranger profession was only becoming more complex. The federal Office of Personnel Management sums up the diversity of the official park ranger series of professional white-collar occupational groups as follows: > This series covers positions the duties of which are to supervise, manage, > and/or perform work in the conservation and use of Federal park resources. > This involves functions such as park conservation; natural, historical, and > cultural resource management; and the development and operation of > interpretive and recreational programs for the benefit of the visiting > public. Duties characteristically include assignments such as: forest and > structural fire control; protection of property from natural or visitor > related depredation; dissemination to visitors of general, historical, or > scientific information; folk-art and craft demonstration; control of traffic > and visitor use of facilities; enforcement of laws and regulations; > investigation of violations, complaints, trespass/encroachment, and > accidents; search and rescue missions; and management activities related to > resources such as wildlife, lakeshores, seashores, forests, historic > buildings, battlefields, archeological properties, and recreation areas.U.S. > Office of Personnel Management. Handbook of occupational groups and > families. Washington, D.C. January 2008. Page 19. OPM.gov Accessed January > 2, 2009. =Interpretation and education= *Interpretation: park rangers provide a wide range of informational services to visitors. Some rangers provide practical information‚Äîsuch as driving directions, train timetables, weather forecasts, trip planning resources, and beyond. Rangers may provide interpretive programs to visitors intended to foster stewardship of the resources. Interpretation in this sense includes guided tours about the park's history, ecology or both; slideshows, talks, demonstrations; informal contacts, and historical re-enactments. Interpretive rangers apply the latest scholarship to continuously evaluate and plan interpretive programming and methods. Products include traditional printed materials and outdoor wayside exhibits, and now include web-based and digital applications. All uniformed rangers, regardless of their primary duties, are often expected to be experts on the resources in their care, whether they are natural or cultural. *Education: rangers may also engage in leading more formalized curriculum- based educational programs, meant to support and complement instruction received by visiting students in traditional academic settings, or in creating resource-based curriculum materials for other educators to utilize. Rangers often develop education programs to help educators meet specific national and local standards of instruction. Cultural resource education may include access to artifacts or replicas, and natural resource education may include the taking of samples, all under the supervision of a ranger to insure proper protection of the resources. Unlike interpretation, education programs include the opportunity to assess learning and designed to meet external standards using the protected resources as the subject. =Law enforcement and emergency services= By the 1970s the National Park Service recognized that in order to protect visitors and park resources effectively the service needed professional rangers dedicated primarily to law enforcement, emergency medical services, firefighting, and search and rescue. Although some modern NPS rangers in this specialty (\\"protection rangers\\") may be primarily engaged in law enforcement duties, the many varied environments they work in may require these employees to be competent in a variety of public safety skills. Rangers who have received a law enforcement commission wear the standard NPS uniform with the Department of the Interior law enforcement badge. In larger park units search and rescue, emergency medicine, and other functions may be a branch of the \\"visitor services\\" or \\"protection\\" division and may not require a commission. Education The United States Office of Personnel Management provides the following guidance concerning education requirements for all park rangers: > Undergraduate and Graduate Education: Major study -- natural resource > management, natural sciences, earth sciences, history, archeology, > anthropology, park and recreation management, law enforcement/police > science, social sciences, museum sciences, business administration, public > administration, behavioral sciences, sociology, or other closely related > subjects pertinent to the management and protection of natural and cultural > resources. Course work in fields other than those specified may be accepted > if it clearly provides applicants with the background of knowledge and > skills necessary for successful job performance in the position to be > filled. Specialized experience may be substituted for education in some cases. =Specialized education and training= In addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate coursework, the following specialized study pertain to the park ranger profession: Interpretation In the last decades of the 20th century the field of resource interpretation began to consciously professionalize itself. This has resulted in the early 21st century with colleges and universities offering coursework and degrees in interpretation.

It is also a ward of the City of Leicester whose population at the 2011 census was 11,644. It is also known as the West End of Leicester. The area is quite small in comparison with other areas of the city, but it is well known as it has many shops, bars and restaurants and is a popular choice for students and young professionals. The West End of Leicester, England is an inner city area just west of the city centre, on the opposite side of the River Soar (past the West Bridge). The main roads in the area are Braunstone Gate, Hinckley Road and Narborough Road. The proximity to De Montfort University makes it a popular student area. Further to the south is the Braunstone estate, and to the west is the Dane Hills area. The area was developed quite late, because the land remained part of two privately held estates until the 1870s.Jack Simmons, Leicester Past and Present: volume 2, Modern City 1860-1974 (London, 1974), p. 7 and therefore is somewhat less dense than other inner city areas like Highfields and Belgrave. History =Roman= Two Roman roads crossed the West End. Both of these roads crossed the River Soar at a place close to where the West Bridge stands today. One of these roads headed in a south-westerly direction, which was the Fosse Way. The Fosse Way ran from the vicinity of Exeter to Lincolnshire, passing through Leicester. A second road ran directly westwards to join Watling Street, another important Roman Road, at Mancetter in Warwickshire. In the 1970s the remains of a Roman villa were discovered close to the course of the Mancetter road on Saxon Street. The dwelling included many features that were characteristic of life throughout the Roman Empire; including under-floor heating and painted wall-plaster. The remains of the decorations can still be seen at the Jewry Wall Museum. =Medieval and early modern periods= According to the Domesday book of 1086, the West End formed part of what was known as Bromkinsthorpe. The land was then divided into two areas under the Enclosure Acts during the reign of Charles I in 1626. In the early 1780s, some Roman mosaics were found amongst the cherry tree roots at Danet‚Äôs Hall (which belonged to the Danet family from the 15th to the late 17th centuries), located \\"between Bow Bridge and Fosse Road on a wooded lane known as Watt‚Äôs Causeway, later to become King Richards Road\\". In 1850, the owner (Dr Noble), on finding the possibility that there may be Roman remains on his property, donated any finds to the Town Hall and a dig was commenced. Finds can now be seen at the Jewry Wall Museum. = The Victorian era = Victorian housing in Narborough Road In 1861, Dr Noble died of cholera in Spain. The Danet's Hall estate passed to the Leicester Freehold Land Society, and building soon followed. As the Leicester Improvement Act of 1881 was passed in Parliament, a long straight cut was made from the Burton Railway Bridge north to the King Richards Road. This allowed the canalisation of the River Soar into the \\"Mile Straight\\" and allowed the draining of the marshy land to the west of the river. This permitted the development of land to the west of the river. More new streets were laid out towards the end of the 19th Century and much of the area to the east was built up by 1900. In the next 40 years the area was to become completely built up. The street pattern laid down in these times remains to this day. Much of the area belonged to the Westcotes Estate (from where the area derives its name), formerly in the possession of the Ruding family since 1558, was sold, in 1821, to Thomas Freer, Clerk of the Peace, with office in New Street. His son sold it in 1843 to Joseph Harris, the last owner. The mansion, known as Westcotes, was sited in the area now occupied by Cranmer Street, and it was the home of Joseph Harris until 1886 when much of the estate was sold and the house demolished. During the latter half of the 19th century industry in Leicester grew at a great pace, principally in its already well established knitting, hosiery and boot and shoe industries. The increase in the workforce created a need for more housing. Much of the house construction in the West End area was undertaken by small enterprise, leading to considerable diversity in building design and form, even over relatively narrow geographical scales. The area to this day still mainly consists of Victorian housing stock. = Twentieth century = The Hindu temple and the Church of the Martyrs The West End area, together with the Walnut Street district on the other side of the River Soar, was an important residential area in the early twentieth century. With textile, clothing and shoe-making employers such as Liberty Shoes and N. Corah and Sons nearby, and with the manufacturing centres of Woodgate and Frog Island in adjacent districts, the West End was home to many of the employees of Leicester's dominant industries. As a consequence, these areas had a vibrant community based around factory life, and around other social institution such as sports clubs and churches.In the boot and shoe manufacturers' lock-out of 1895, for instance, it was the vicar of St Andrew's in Westcotes who acted as arbitrator between workers and employees: Simmons 1974, p. 34. Following the end of World War II, there were changes in the make up of the population in the West End. The 1951 Census recorded 1,029 people born in the USSR, mainly Ukrainians, in the City. The older terraced houses in the West End provided rented accommodation. Due to the nature of the migration, the Ukrainian men were separated from the women and twice as many males than women arrived in Leicester. As a consequence many single men married local girls and a close-knit community was formed. Orthodox Ukrainians held services at the Church of the Martyrs on Westcotes Drive. This helped maintain Ukrainian culture in the area. This group amassed enough capital and later bought its own church on the corner of Hinckley road and Fosse Road South which they bought from the Methodists. The condition of housing much of central Leicester was, by post-war standards, very poor.For a discussion of this, see: From 1970 to 1971 a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) was made under the Housing Act 1957 to allow \\"outworn terraces\\" to be cleared. This allowed road works for an improved western approach to the city along the A47 and King Richards Road. 1,084 houses were cleared in total under the CPO. Westcotes Gardens According to Leicester City Council's Local Heritage Asset Register, the land for Westcotes Gardens was gifted to the City by Westcotes Estates Ltd. as part of their development of surrounding residential streets. The Register indicates that the Gardens were laid out and opened circa 1905. The attached historic picture of Westcotes Gardens shows in the background the terrace of houses forming nos. 36-46 (evens), 132 Beaconsfield Rd (originally Bismark Street) and 171 Upperton Road. According to the Asset Register, this terrace was designed by local firm Pick Everard circa 1906. The picture shows what appears to be a detached stable block to the rear of 171 Upperton Road which no longer exists. It seems likely that the block was demolished to make way for 167-169 Upperton Road. The picture also appears to show a detached (possibly agricultural?) building to the north of Westcotes Gardens, now occupied by the 1920s houses and their gardens of Upperton Road and Ashleigh Road. Westcotes Gardens, Leicester, c. 1910 For comparison, also attached is a picture taken from an equivalent position in Westcotes Gardens in March 2020. thumb  References   External links  * Historical information from Leicester City Council. * Walking Tour of the West End, at My Leicestershire. * Family & Community strand of University of Leicester's Manufacturing Pasts project, featuring interviews with residents of the West End area. * Oral History interviews with West End residents, from the East Midlands Oral History archive, available on the My Leicestershire website.

The primary action of the novel is set in the Nevada desert during a joint training exercise. Plot As the Christmas of 2007 approaches, James Adams taking part in a mass riot organized by Chris Bradford, the charismatic leader of anarchist group SAG (Street Action Group). He later acts as Bradford's bodyguard during a meeting with a gun supplier and successfully plants a surveillance device, only for the police to arrive unexpectedly and arrest everyone, aborting the mission. James returns to campus to discover that his girlfriend Dana Smith has been cheating on him with fellow cherub Michael Hendry, and breaks up with her. Meanwhile, James' sister Lauren and some younger agents are sent to test the security of an air traffic control centre. They capture all the security guards and cause a lot of damage, but miss an engineer who calls in the RAF. The mission is still regarded as successful, having exposed security weaknesses. On New Year's Day a select team of CHERUB agents, including James and Lauren, fly to Las Vegas for a brief vacation on the way to Fort Reagan, the world's largest urban warfare training compound. They are to take part in a two-week exercise along with forty British commandos, posing as insurgents in an area controlled by an American battalion of a thousand soldiers. Weapons are restricted to paint guns and grenades. Under the leadership of Ukrainian trainer Yosyp Kazakov, who is bitterly anti- American, the \\"insurgents\\" soon make their first move, knocking out aerial surveillance by wrecking the American spying drones. During this raid, James and the British sergeant sneak into the army base to add a powerful laxative to the base's water system, incapacitating the majority of the American troops with violent diarrhoea. The \\"insurgents\\" persuade some drunken students, posing as \\"civilians\\" in the exercise, to join them in storming the base. The American military leader General Shirley is \\"killed\\" (within the exercise, being killed means that you have to get yourself washed and come back in 24 hours) by a paint grenade dropped by cherub Kevin Sumner. The Americans are overrun and suspend the exercise after only two days. Kazakov's tactics, though effective, are so controversial that he and James are asked to leave before the exercise restarts. As they have some free time, Kazakov persuades James to put his mathematical skills to illegal use, counting cards on blackjack tables in Las Vegas. Despite James almost being caught, they end up winning over $90,000. Arriving back at campus, Lauren mentions to James that his ex-girlfriend, Kerry Chang, has broken up with her boyfriend Bruce Norris after having a massive ruck at the hotel they were staying at after the exercise. Promotion An official competition was run by Robert Muchamore, where a signed copy of the book was promised to any reader who could supply him with the password of one of his forum staff members. The novel was released on 7 August 2008 in Australia and NZ, and on 4 September 2008 in the UK.  Cover  The British cover for The General is two playing cards.

Peace Commissioners have the power to issue summons and warrants and to sign certificates and orders under various Acts of the Oireachtas.The Courts of Justice Act 1924 Role The Courts of Justice Act 1924 gives Peace Commissioners the power to issue summons and warrants. The title, first proposed as \\"Parish Commissioner\\", replaced Justice of the Peace, which according to Dail Debates at the time of the Bill's discussion was considered 'Too British Sounding'. Peace Commissioners are primarily used to issue summons and search warrants to the Garda√≠ (now less used as the constitutionality has been challenged), witness signatures on documents, take statutory declarations and sign certificates and orders. Peace commissioners cannot sign and authenticate Affidavits. As of 2012 there were 5,733 serving Peace Commissioners operating throughout the state. A Peace Commissioner should not sign any document that s/he has an \\"interest\\" in. The exact meaning of what constitutes an \\"interest\\" is a vexed one, but generally this means that a PC should not sign documents for members of his/her own family, and people who whom s/he works. The rationale behind this rule is that a Peace Commissioner is supposed to be an independent witness, and cannot be considered independent in the aforementioned circumstances. Appointment The Office of Peace Commissioner is a discretionary appointment by the Minister for Justice and Equality, a member of the Government. There is no special application form. An application for appointment may be made by a person on their own behalf or a nomination for appointment may be made by a third party in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment. Nominations are generally received from public representatives, and a Garda superintendent may sometimes request an appointment in his or her district as the need arises in the public interest. Persons seeking appointment to the Office of Peace Commissioner can apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality and should set out the reason for the application or nomination and provide some background information about the person proposed for appointment. There is no qualifying examination, but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community. People convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable. Civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment (i.e. ex- officio). Solicitors, people employed in legal offices, and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because their occupation may cause a conflict of interest when exercising the duties of a peace commissioner. The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not, in itself, provide any entitlement to appointment as a peace commissioner because other factors, such as the need for appointments in particular areas, are taken into account. Problems The title of 'Peace Commissioner' is only recognised in Ireland, so you should not use a Peace Commissioner to sign documents which you intend using outside of Ireland. Meanwhile, it is the case that most Peace Commissioner do not have a rubber stamp containing their name and title. This causes many documents to be rejected because forms and agencies expect a rubber stamp. Strictly speaking, a stamp is not required according to the Minister for Justice http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PQ-07-03-2017-106 but in practice, agencies do often reject stamp-less documents. When booking a Peace Commissioner is it advisable to ask if they have a rubber stamp. Most Commissioners for Oaths do have a stamp. Finding a Peace Commissioner The Department of Justice and Equality maintains the Roll of Peace Commissioners, however this is not accessible online. The Department will usually provide the name and address of a Peace Commissioner on request. Local Garda stations, who use the services of a Peace Commissioner in the course of their duties are usually in a position to give you the name and address of a Peace Commissioner in a particular area. It is often easier to find a Commissioner for Oaths. A Commissioner for Oaths can also sign Statutory Declarations, and can in addition sign Affidavits. Because a Commissioner for Oaths can charge they will have an incentive to advertise and are available in most towns nationwide. It is customary for Peace Commissioners to use the abbreviation PC after their name to make themselves known when requested by the Garda and members of the public to discharge their duties. Costs and rates Peace Commissioners is an honorary role and there is no remuneration or financial compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services whatsoever. However, in practice many will ask for donations. There is debate in the legal community over this. It is true to say that many have town centre premises and the act of signing a document does carry a cost.

Founded November 13, 1888 as the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, the organization was known as the Phoenix Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce from 1973-1987 and adopted its present name in 1998. Its mission is to support the growth and development of business, strengthen the quality of life in the community, champion the voice of business in government and keep its members informed, connected and prosperous.  History  The Phoenix Chamber originally spearheaded efforts towards attracting more settlers to the Valley of the Sun, building a railroad to tap the rich forest country to the north, building better roads and supplying accommodations for those who traveled to Arizona for the winter sunshine. The following year saw the state capitol move from Prescott to Phoenix and marked the beginning of the area's citrus and agriculture industry. The Chamber of Commerce began the processing of fruits and other products to offer a permanent display for visitors as proof of what the land could produce. If agriculture were to be a permanent success of the area, water storage to carry over during the summer months was crucial. A Chamber committee studied the possibilities of building dams on the Salt River to form reservoirs for water storage, and agreed unanimously upon the present site of the Roosevelt Dam. It was through the combined efforts of these businessmen and pioneer farmers that Congress was convinced to bring into effect the plan of Reclamation to capture and hold water from the Colorado River. The hauling of crops to market, along with the rapidly growing change in transportation from horse-drawn vehicles to motor travel, created an insistent urge for a paved highway system. That development birthed an expansion of the urban area, building of fine country homes, subdivisions, more schools, more people and more wealth. In addition, Maricopa County became the leader, not only in Arizona but throughout the nation, in building paved highways. The ease and comfort of traveling over paved highways brought more fine hotels, guest ranches on the city's outskirts, and an awakened consciousness to the possibilities of selling the climate to people who lived in less favorable parts of the country. This, in turn, led to the development of the National Advertising Campaign, sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and supported jointly by Maricopa County and the City of Phoenix. Among the many undertakings of the early organization was the raising of $3,000 (equivalent to $58,824 today) for the purchase of a plot of ground that is now the historic Phoenix Indian School. This group of business and professional leaders was perhaps the greatest factor in determining the location of the Arizona Territorial Capital in Phoenix. It was logical that the Capital should be located in a town where there was promise and people had the vision and energy to behold this promise.

It is located about north of the town of Lillooet and west of Clinton. 6 km upstream from the ferry is French Bar Canyon (sometimes known as Big Bar Canyon), while downstream is High Bar Canyon (the ferry is located at one of the few places possible for a river crossing accessible by road from both sides in this area). The ferry connects the dirt ranch road up the west side of the Fraser from Lillooet to Big Bar and Kostering, which connect via road to Jesmond and Big Bar Lake, and beyond to BC Highway 97. Description Technically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. An overhead cable is suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river, and a \\"traveller\\" is installed on the cable. The ferry is attached to the traveller by a bridle cable. To operate the ferry, rudders are used to ensure that the pontoons are angled into the current, causing the force of the current to move the ferry across the river. The ferry operates under contract to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation, is free of tolls, and runs on demand between 0700 and 1900. It carries a maximum of 2 cars and 12 passengers at a time. The crossing is about in length, and takes 10 minutes. At times of low/high water, or ice in the river, the ferry is replaced by an aerial tramway that carries passengers only.

Subsequently he was Defense Minister until March 1, 2010.'Gonzalo Fern√°ndez (pol√≠tico)', Wikipedia (in Spanish) :es:Gonzalo Fern√°ndez (pol√≠tico), Background Fern√°ndez was previously a senior aide to the President of Uruguay Tabar√© V√°zquez from 2005 to 2008. His professional training was as a lawyer. Prior to working at the Secretariat of the Presidency, Fern√°ndez had worked as a lawyer for Dr. V√°zquez when the latter was a practising medical doctor. A Socialist, he was noted for his pragmatism and mastery of complex negotiations, and was seen as less ideological than his fellow-Socialist predecessor as Foreign Minister, Reinaldo Gargano. Issues A number of salient foreign affairs issues which Fern√°ndez inherited as Foreign Minister could be identified. These included: =Trade liberalization= Proposed moves for the liberalization of trade with the United States which he was thought to favour personally, but to which many of his left-wing party colleagues were viscerally opposed. A wider issue related to Uruguay's membership of, and hosting of the Secretariat of, Mercosur, the regional trade agreement. The challenge of Fern√°ndez was thus to pursue stable relations with Uruguay's regional trading partners with the goal of a climate favouring economic growth, while seeking not to disabuse openly the aspirations of the statist and protectionist Uruguayan Left, which supported the government in which he served. =Relations with Cuba and Venezuela= These were championed by his predecessor Reinaldo Gargano. Fern√°ndez's appointment came as Fidel Castro, long regarded as a mythical, cult figure by the Uruguayan Left, particularly after Castro's associate Che Guevara visited the Uruguayan city of Punta del Este, stepped down as President of Cuba. His appointment also coincided with the deterioration of relations between Venezuela and Colombia amidst threats of war, with Venezuela's sharp differences with the United States coming especially into focus. While Fern√°ndez's presumed less ideological approach to links with Venezuela and Cuba may not have been greatly significant at a personal level, it was thought that Fern√°ndez is likely to press hard for Uruguay to avoid becoming embroiled in anti-American political rhetoric. While in September 2008 Venezuela and Bolivia expelled their respective US Ambassadors, it was hard to envisage Uruguayan foreign policy under Fern√°ndez, though rhetorically very pro- Venezuela, taking such an anti-American line.

These problems arise with both case studies and more general surveys, and are particularly intractable when the appropriate control group is in another country. There have been virtually no base period studies, to determine the position before a cooperative joined Fairtrade, so it is seldom possible to claim that the farmers in a cooperative are better off or have more self-esteem because of Fairtrade, rather than because Fairtrade selects efficient cooperatives with educated, efficient, well-off farmers. The possibility that all groups of farmers have increased incomes because of higher world prices, changed exchange rates etc. is difficult to tackle. As most of the extra money paid by consumers is taken by firms in rich countries or is spent on added costs incurred in meeting Fairtrade standards, it is seldom possible to identify direct financial benefit to farmers, and the studies concentrate on non- monetary benefits, like improvement in self-esteem or the creation of community development projects. These are difficult to measure, and it is particularly difficult to measure these non-monetary benefits in control groups of local non-Fairtrade farmers, the extent to which non-Fairtrade farmers lose self-esteem, etc. because they are excluded from Fair trade impact studies, for instance, and even more difficult to measure any effects on non-Fairtrade farmers in other, poorer, countries. The decision on which such measures to include introduces a bias: it may be asked whether there are other non-money costs or benefits that might be included in the studies which would give answers less favourable to Fairtrade. An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade Nelson, V., & Pound, B.: 2009, The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade. Retrieved from http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx found only 33 studies that met their own criteria (not those of the World Bank or Inter-American Bank) for impact studies. These 33 included unpublished undergraduate and masters‚Äô dissertations, unpublished theses, articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. Griffiths suggests that even this is optimistic: there are very few studies that examine any of the costs identified by critics of Fairtrade in the Fair trade debate, and fewer still that attempt to quantify them. There are few mentions in the literature of the biggest financial costs and benefits, the extra price paid by consumers and the extra profit made by companies in rich countries, and fewer attempts to quantify these. One impact, the amount of money going to businesses in rich countries rather than to Third World producers, is addressed in only a handful of studies.Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., & Niemi, N. (2010). ‚ÄúEmpowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.‚Äù Journal of Business Ethics, 97:257-270Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., & Villalobos, A. (2006). ‚ÄúIs Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee‚Äù. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322‚Äì330. These show that in some cases 90% to 99.5% of the extra money paid by consumers is kept as extra profit by firms in rich countries but cannot show that this is typical. The conclusion is rather that secretiveness prevents impact analysis of the full Fairtrade system. Few studies analyse how much extra money is received by the cooperatives, what it is spent on, how much is taken by managers of cooperatives and how much reaches the farmers. Few studies discuss the costs identified in the Fair trade debate. There are, however, case studies of Fairtrade cooperatives which do not attempt to be impact studies, identifying and quantifying all positive and negative impacts, but are, rather, examinations of how subsections of the system operate, usually single Fairtrade cooperatives and sometimes one Fairtrade product in a country - valuable but different research. Even if twenty or thirty studies which met the impact evaluation criteria could be identified, it would not be possible to generalize from them because it is not claimed that they are typical. The studies are not of randomly selected cooperatives. They are concentrated on better known, more successful and well established ones, and there are few which examine the problems of cooperatives which have recently joined Fairtrade or of the least successful quartile of Fairtrade cooperatives.

They lived there for 16 years before moving to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2000 and gaining citizenship. Mohamed had been found guilty in a Saudi court for the murder of a 19-year-old Syrian boy, Munzer Hiraki, who died in a schoolyard brawl in January 2007. Mohamed was sentenced to death and Sultan to 200 lashes. Their sentences were later commuted. Incident, trial and aftermath In January 2007, Mohamed and his brother Sultan were involved in a fight that broke out after a girl's male cousin accused Sultan of insulting her. The girl's cousin demanded an apology, but Sultan refused. Sultan, then 16, said he called for help from Mohamed when he was confronted by several boys over the insult. According to the brothers' account, Mohamed Kohail arrived at the school with a male friend to face about a dozen of the girl's male relatives and friends, some armed with clubs and knives. A brawl started, and according to the victim's cousins, Sultan, Mohamed and another boy beat Munzer to death. No footage exists of that action, but clear footage showed the victim, Munzer, kicking Mohamed in the head. Their original trial before the General Court took place over nine sessions, lasting approximately 10 minutes per session. Their lawyer was allowed to attend only the last one or two, and was not allowed to challenge the evidence brought against his clients. During the hearing on March 3, the Kohail defense brought two witnesses but the court did not take them into consideration. The Kohail defense team denied that Munzer died because of the fight but rather due to heart problems, as evidenced by the autopsy. Munzer's mother presented a health certificate dated six months previously which indicated that he was in perfect condition. When asked why she had obtained a health certificate, Munzer's mother replied that her son needed a health certificate so that he could run in a marathon. On March 3, 2008 the court sentenced Mohamed Kohail to be executed by public beheading. In February 2009, the Saudi Supreme Court rejected the death sentence and asked the lower court to revise its ruling. However, on April 2, 2009, the lower court rejected the recommendation of the higher court and reconfirmed the death penalty. In May 2013 the Ottawa Citizen reported that Mohamed Kohail had been released from prison in December 2012. The family never released a statement and the release went uncovered in Saudi Arabia itself.

The book, by studying coffee farmers in Mexico, offers an investigation of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of fair trade. Based on research in Zapotec indigenous communities in the state of Oaxaca, Brewing Justice follows the members of the cooperative Michiza, whose organic coffee is sold on the international fair trade market. It compares these families to conventional farming families in the same region, who depend on local middlemen and are vulnerable to the fluctuations of the world coffee market. The book carries readers into the lives of these coffee producer households and their communities, offering a nuanced analysis of both the effects of fair trade on everyday life and the limits of its impact. Brewing Justice paints a clear picture of the complex dynamics of the fair trade market and its relationship to the global economy. Drawing on interviews with dozens of fair trade leaders, the book also explores the changing politics of this international movement, including the challenges posed by the entry of transnational corporations into the fair trade system. It concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening and protecting the integrity of fair trade.

The character first made an appearance on the fifth season episode \\"Iced\\", which aired on May 12, 2005 in the United States. Casting Prior to being cast as Henry, actor Jon Wellner made a guest appearance in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as zookeeper Sam Tracy in the fifth-season episode \\"Unbearable\\", which was broadcast on February 10, 2005. Wellner became a series regular in Season 13. Storylines Henry is the toxicology specialist of the Las Vegas Forensics Laboratory, mainly dealing with identifying toxic substances which have undergone human consumption. He has an impressive knowledge of lethal substances, including, but not limited to: illegal drugs, alcoholic beverages, poisons, and hazardous gases (such as carbon monoxide). He constantly exhibits a thorough understanding of the toxins' properties and effects. He originally worked days (as he mentions in the episode Iced) but kept \\"getting moved around\\" by Ecklie. In the later seasons, he is seen more frequently working the graveyard shift. In the episode \\"Lab Rats,\\" the character has a prominent role and an appreciable amount of screen time compared to previous, short- lived appearances. Wendy refers to him as one of Hodges's \\"lemmings\\". Henry is unmarried, and often jokingly offers to marry his fellow lab tech, fingerprint analyst Mandy Webster. He goes on to reveal that his grandmother lives in a retirement home in Boca Raton, Florida, where he is shuffleboard champion. He refers to himself as a \\"lady killer\\" among the senior citizens. By season eight, the lab technicians have superficially formed a suggested \\"rat pack,\\" and provide a large amount of comic relief. The episodes \\"Lab Rats\\" and \\"You Kill Me\\" focus on this group, with Hodges once again acting as their ringleader. In each of the scenarios, Hodges personifies Henry as neurotic and easily intimidated. Henry admits to being frightened of Detective Jim Brass. Henry often attempts to be comical or witty without avail, which is amusing in its own right. He is intelligent, friendly, and good-natured. On occasions he appears high-strung. He is analytical and digests information well, which helps him reach accurate conclusions and understand facets of human nature.

The term derives from Latin inter (among) and regalia (things of the king). There are two classes of rights, divided into: *The regalia majora (major regalia), which are inseparable from the person of the sovereign. *The regalia minora (minor regalia), which may be conveyed to a subject.  The Regalia Majora  [Section in Edit]  The Regalia Minora  Under feudal law, which operated in Scotland from the Davidian Revolution until 28 November 2004,Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000 s.1 all land in Scotland was originally owned by the Crown (ie: The King/Queen of Scots of the time). Certain rights in the land, called the regalia minora, could be reserved to the Crown when the Crown granted land to a Crown vassal. Today, following the abolition of feudalism, any of the regalia minora that has not been expressly granted to the owner of land through previous grant or another individual as a separate legal tenement, still remains the property of the Crown under the Regalia Minora.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession, page 226. = Right to fish salmon = Termed by Gretton and Steven as the \\"most important legal separate tenement.\\"Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession., page 227. Riparian (Water) law is an area of Scots property law concerning the ownership of sections of rivers and their attached rights.For full discussion, see J. Robbie, Private water rights in Scots law, PhD Thesis: https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/7796. Subsequently published as J. Robbie, Private Water Rights, Edinburgh Legal Education Trust (Edinburgh, 2015). However, despite any rights for fishing given to owners of the land under Scots riparian law, the Crown alone has the right to fish salmon. In practice, the Crown can transfer ownership, lease or license these rights to other individuals, often at high value due to the commercial interests of salmon fishing. The holder of the right of ownership in the salmon-fishing rights is treated as a separate legal owner from the owner of the land, _as a separate legal tenemen_ t.Stair II, 3, 69. Viscount Stair is an institutional writer and as such is a source of law in Scots law. Anyone fishing for salmon without permission of the owner of the tenement (ie: the salmon fishing right) commits a criminal offence under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003.Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003, section 6. = Right to shellfishing (mussels and oysters) = Historically, this right had been considered part of the regalia _majora_ , and therefore could be exercised by the general public fishing in the territorial sea of Scotland. However, following Parker v Lord Advocate[1904] A.C. 364, (1904) 6 F. (H.L.) 37, (1904) 12 S.L.T. 33, it has been established that the right of mussel gathering and right of oyster gathering are a separate legal tenement and are the property of the Crown if not expressly granted to the owner of the mussel-bed land. The Crown's right to take mussels and right to take oysters is of continued relevance due to the commercial success of Scottish seafood.In 2017, Fish and seafood accounted for the majority of food exports in Scotland and were worth approximately ¬£944 million, up 23% from the previous year and 16% of total food and drink exports. The Crown, or a subsequent owner, can transfer these rights to the owner of the mussel-bed or another individual through a disposition. There are two alternatives to this option to obtain the right: (1) Obtaining the right of ownership of the tenement (shellfishing rights) through prescriptive possession The rationale for this tenement belonging to the Crown as regalia _minora_ , and not held for the general public under the rights of regalia majora, appears to be due to the risks incumbent with overfishing the sea- bed.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 5, The Separate Tenements, para 333. = Right of port = The Crown has the right to operate ports and ferry services as separate tenements of the land, and this right continues to be held by the Crown except where the tenement has been granted to the owners of the land.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch. 6, Water, The Separate Tenements, para 334. Modern ports and harbours are now largely covered by private legislation and the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (c 27).For full authoritative discussion and current legislation concerning harbours, see Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 11. However the underlying authority for (ie: the deeds of) ownership for historic ports may still be in a separate legal tenement so the right of port is of continued relevance. In a piece of land subject to a separate tenement of port, no individual is permitted to use the foreshore without paying the relevant harbour fees.Edinburgh Magistrates v Scot (1836) 14 S 922. Where no historic grant of port from the Crown exists, there is nothing to preclude the Owner of the land adjacent to the water operating and charging for port facilities (except where the land concerned is the foreshore as this is subject to public rights of access under the regalia majora). In practice however, aspects of maritime law regulating ports will also be required to be complied with where an individual establishes a port. However, both the separate legal tenements of the right to port and right to ferry can be acquired by an individual either by express grant from the owner of the tenement, whether the Crown or the owner of the land, or by positive prescription. = Right of ferry = The Crown has the right to operate ports and ferry services, and this right continues to be held by the Crown except where the tenement has been granted to owners of the land.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch. 6, Water, The Separate Tenements, para 334. The Crown's right to ferry was often granted to royal burghs, as the Crown did not have the capacity to provide these services.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 11, para 1301. An example of a Crown ferry can be seen at the River Forth, where Queen Margaret established a ferry service between North & South Queensferry. While the Crown right of ferry still exists, bridges have often been constructed to replace traditional Crown ferry services, as was the case with the North & South Queensferry ferry after the opening of the Forth Road Bridge in 1964. The Scottish Government owned company Caledonian MacBrayne now operates the majority of ferry routes in Scotland.For a critical analysis of the Scottish ferry system, see R. Pedersen, Who Pays the Ferryman? The Great Scottish Ferries Swindle (Edinburgh, 2013). In cases of land subject to a separate tenement of ferry, no individual may carry passengers as a ferry other than the Owner, their family, guests of the Owner and employees of the Owner.London Midland and Scottish Rly Co v M'Donald 1924 SC 835, 1924 SLT 630. Where no historic grant of port or ferry from the Crown exists, there is nothing to preclude the Owner of the land adjacent to the water operating and charging for port or ferry facilities (except where the land concerned is the foreshore as this is subject to public rights of access under the regalia majora). In practice however, aspects of maritime law regulating ferries and other water-based public transport will also be required to be complied with where an individual establishes a ferry service. However, both the separate legal tenements of the right to port and right to ferry can be acquired by an individual either by express grant from the owner of the tenement, whether the Crown or the owner of the land, or by prescriptive possession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 6, Water, The Separate Tenements, para 334. = Right to mine gold and silver = Under the Royal Mines Act 1424, the oldest Act still in force in Scots law, the Crown reserves all rights to mine gold or silver under the inter regalia minora. Where the owner of the land does not also expressly own the tenement of mining rights, the Crown alone has the right to mine silver or gold. The owner of the land has a statutory right to obtain a grant of ownership from the Crown of the mining tenement, provided the owner pays to the Crown the value of 1/10th of all metal mined under the Mines and Metals Act 1592.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession. Page 227. = Right to hold fairs and markets = A landowner in Scotland is not entitled to hold fairs or markets without an express grant of that right from the Crown.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch 5, para 210. This right is of little relevance in modern times, with fairs and markets largely being regulated in the first instance by local government statute but its status as a right of the Crown under the regalia minora and as a separate tenement continues to be valid law.Central Motors (St Andrews) Ltd v St Andrews Magistrates 1961 SLT 290. = Petroleum and Natural Gas = Under the Petroleum Act 1998, and previously the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934,Section 1. all petrol and natural gas found in Scotland belongs to the Crown unless the right to the fuels in the strata had been expressly granted to the Owner of the land.Petroleum Act 1998 Section 2. = Right to Ownerless Property = While not classed as capable of creating a separate legal tenement, it is recognised that the Crown has two rights to ownerless property in Scots law falling under the regalia minora. As part of the regalia minora,Lord Hunter, Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen, p. 542, citing , vol. 1, ch. 16, pp. 40 and 45; , vol. 2, ch. 3, p. 60, and vol. 3, ch. 3, p. 27; Bankton, An Institute of the Laws of Scotland in Civil Rights, vol. 1, ch. 3, p. 16; and Bell, Principles of the Law of Scotland, s. 1293. it may alienate these rights so that another individual can take ownership., col. 1010. These are:  Bona Vacantia  Under Scots law, ownerless property is classed as bona vacantia (lit: vacant goods), and falls into the ownership of the Crown.For an accessible discussion of bona vacantia and ultimus haeres in Scots law, see G L Gretton and A J M Steven, Property, Trusts and Succession 3rd ed. (London, 2017) ( ‚ÄúGretton & Steven‚Äù) at 3. Other jurisdictions employ similar concepts of ownerless property, see bona vacantia. This is because the Scots law adoption of the principle that quod nullius est fit domini regis (\\"that which belongs to nobody becomes our lord the king's [or queen's]\\").Lord Patrick in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen 1963 S.C. 533 at p. 554, Inner House, Court of Session, citing Sands v. Bell & Balfour (22 May 1810), F.C.; Lord Hunter in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen, p. 549, Outer House, Court of Session, citing an earlier edition of , s. 1291(3). All property (both moveable or heritable) is liable to become bona vacantia, as the Scottish Law Commission note: > \\"‚ÄòAs a result of the discarding of litter, every day Her Majesty becomes the > owner of countless items such as cigarette ends, crisp packets and chewing > gum.‚Äô\\"Scottish Law Commission, Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable > Property (SLC Report No 228, 2012) para 5.2. Available: > https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/reports/ > Moveable property is said to be abandoned after the expiration of the right of ownership by negative prescription. Heritable property cannot be abandoned.Scottish Environmental Protection Agency v Joint Administrators of the Scottish Coal Company [2013] CSIH 108. Tasked with administering the Crown‚Äôs right to ownerless or bona vacantia property is the office of the Queen‚Äôs and Lord Treasurer‚Äôs Remembrancer (‚Äúthe QLTR‚Äù). Today the QTLR operates under the direction of the Scottish Ministers (Public Revenue (Scotland) Act 1833, s.2), and is based in Edinburgh at the Scottish Government‚Äôs Victoria Quay Building. The QTLR‚Äôs website can be found at https://www.qltr.gov.uk. The QLTR retains full discretion to ‚Äúdisclaim‚Äù (decline to exercise) the Crown‚Äôs right to take ownership, in which case another party may instead take ownership by occupatio or positive prescription. Otherwise, the QLTR can waive the right to disclaim either expressly or by taking possession of the property. Where the Crown wishes to exercise their right, the QLTR issues a Royal Warrant \\\\- a command from the Sovereign, ordering the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland to transfer ownership to the Crown. The Keeper then issues a Deed of Gift under the Cachet Seal. A common case in which land falls to the Crown as bona vacantia is that where it has been owned by a company which is later dissolved (typically, a factory, brownfield land, or office buildings).Companies Act 2006 s.1012 Here, the QLTR can disclaim the Crown‚Äôs right to such company assets by written notice.Companies Act 2006 s.1013 Where the QLTR elects to do so, any person having an interest in the land may apply to the courts for a transfer of ownership in their favour.Companies Act 2006 s.1021 Otherwise original acquisition by occupatio (see above) is capable.SCOTTISH ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY v JOINT LIQUIDATORS OF THE SCOTTISH COAL COMPANY [2013] CSIH 108.  Treasure Trove  Other jurisdictions operate a concept of treasure trove, in which certain classes of treasure, such as precious metals, found within a state's territory falls to the state. Scots law does not make such a distinction, but still classifies any treasure as bona vacantia and therefore falls to the Crown.Gentle v. Smith (1788) 1 Bell Ill. 375; Sands v. Bell and Balfour May 22 1810 F.C.; cf. Cleghorn v. Baird (1696) Mor. 13522. The law of treasure trove is therefore a sub-species of bona vacantia property.Lord Mackintosh in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen, p. 561, Outer House, citing an earlier edition of , vol. 2, ch. 1, pp. 11‚Äì12. The QLTR operates a Treasure Trove Unit, in conjunction with the National Museum of Scotland (NMS) in Edinburgh to receive, process and investigate all ownerless treasure and valuable objects found in Scotland.The QLTR and NMS produce guidance and codes of practice for treasure finders. The Treasure Trove Unit (TTU) has its own website. St. Ninian's Isle, photographed on 24 May 2006. The St. Ninian's Isle treasure, which is believed to date to about AD 800, was found on this island. The most notable case concerning treasure trove is Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen and Budge (1963), also known as the St Ninian's Isle treasure case.T. B. Smith \\"The Law Relating to the Treasure\\" in St. Ninian's Isle and its Treasure (Aberdeen University Studies Series No. 152 edn., Small, Thomas & Wilson 1973) p. 149 In July 1958, a porpoise bone was found together with 28 other objects of silver alloy (12 brooches, seven bowls, a hanging bowl and other small metal work) underneath a stone slab marked with a cross on the floor of St. Ninian's Church on St. Ninian's Isle in Shetland. The objects were dated to c. AD 800. A legal dispute arose over the ownership of the objects between the Crown on the one hand, represented in Scottish courts by the Lord Advocate, and the finder (the University of Aberdeen, which had carried out the archaeological excavation) as well as the landowner, Budge. The Court of Session held that the bone should be regarded as treasure trove together with the silver objects and importantly belonged to the Crown.Lord Mackintosh in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen, p. 559, Inner House; see also Lord Patrick in the same case, p. 555. However, there is academic controversy surrounding this decision.See T. B. Smith \\"The Law Relating to the Treasure\\" in St. Ninian's Isle and its Treasure (Aberdeen University Studies Series No. 152 edn., Small, Thomas & Wilson 1973) p. 149 The Crown is under no legal obligation to offer any rewards for treasure trove property it has claimed. However it may accept the recommendations of the Archaeological Panel and order that the museum taking ownership of the object should make an ex gratia payment to the finder.https://treasuretrovescotland.co.uk/code-of-practice/ The size of the ex gratia payment is subject to various factors, such as the value of the object, any inappropriately handling of an object, any delays in reporting the find, damage to an object etc.  Wrecked Ships  Another distinction of bona vacantia is made in respect of wrecked ships. Shipwrecks fall instead to HM Receiver of Wrecks.Merchant Shipping Act 1995 Part IX. Ultimus Haeres Typically, where an individual dies without leaving a valid will, (ie: they die intestate) their estate is distributed amongst surviving relatives under the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964.Succession (Scotland) Act 1964 s.6 However, where the deceased leaves no surviving heirs, their estate (including any land) falls to the Crown as ultimus haeres (the ultimate heir). The QLTR, in conjunction with the Procurator Fiscal Service, operates a National Ultimus Haeres Unit (‚ÄúNUHU‚Äù) based in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire to receive, process and investigate all unclaimed estates from individuals domiciled in Scotland.

Among her other accomplishments, Wells is notable as the first American woman to register a dunk in an official NCAA intercollegiate basketball game on December 21, 1984. She did so with a regulation-sized ball (also known as a men's basketball). Early life A native of Columbus, Ohio, Wells grew up in a family of 9 children. Wells had an interest in basketball from a young age, playing on her middle school team as well as her high school team at Columbus Northland High School. Aided by her talent, Northland went on to win the state basketball championship. This, in turn, helped Wells secure two athletic scholarships to West Virginia University, which recruited her heavily. College career During her freshman year playing for West Virginia University, Wells averaged 11.9 points per game. In addition to her high scoring, Wells crafted her dunking talent, training to achieve her goal of dunking during a live regulation game. Leveraging her tall stature, Wells and her coaches worked an additional 10 to 15 minutes after each practice, with Wells dunking seven to 20 times to perfect her form Early during the 1984-85 season, Wells came very near to achieving her goal, but her dunk was cancelled when one of her opponents fouled Wells' sister, Marva, just as Wells attempted her dunk. Not long after, on December 21, 1984, Wells went on to make history. Playing at Elkin's Randolph County Armory against the University of Charleston (WV), with 11:18 remaining in the game, Wells received a pass from point guard Lisa Ribble and achieved the first official dunk in a women's college basketball game. WVU won 110-82. The accomplishment was covered extensively in the national media, including the New York Times, Sports Illustrated, and USA Today. The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame featured Wells's accomplishment in a dedicated exhibit, and Wells was honored at an NCAA luncheon in New York. Despite the media coverage, national headlines, and the 100 or so eyewitnesses at the game, for nearly 25 years it was believed that there was no videotape of Wells's achievement. Then, Reed Albergotti, a sports reporter from The Wall Street Journal, started the research for his 2009 feature article \\"The Dunk That Made History,\\" which celebrates the 25-year anniversary of Wells' historic dunk. Albergotti contacted Ford Francis, the son of Bud Francis, who had been the University of Charleston coach in December 1984. Anticipating Wells' intention and even warning his players against the likelihood that Wells would attempt a dunk, Bud Francis stationed a team staffer with a camera on the east side of the armory. A quarter of a century later, Ford Francis recalled that, after his father's death, he had inherited a tape labeled simply \\"W.V.U.-84 Elkins.\\" Upon watching the tape, Francis and Albergotti realized that, even though West Virginia University had left its heavy cameras at home, the historic footage did exist. No woman dunked again in an official game until 1994, when North Carolina's senior forward Charlotte Smith made the second recorded dunk in a women's regular collegiate basketball game against North Carolina A&T; State University. In addition to her historic slam dunk, Wells enjoyed a remarkable career for the WVU women's basketball team. She was a four-year letter winner, scoring 1,484 points and pulling down 1,075 rebounds. Her 436 blocked shots is the all-time record for women at WVU. Post-college career After her college years, Wells toured with the Harlem Globetrotters. Wells also coached for a time, including professional coaching in Japan from 1986‚Äì92, as well as in Spain, Italy, and France from 1992-2003. More recently, Wells has worked as a physical-education teacher in a suburb of her hometown Columbus, Ohio. Honors and awards As center for WVU, Wells earned many honors, including *Third Team, All-American (1985) *Freshman All- American (1983) *First Team, All-Atlantic 10 (1985, 1986) *Second Team, All- Atlantic 10 (1984) In April 2015, Wells and other African-American student athletes were honored at the Erickson Alumni Center at WVU, as part of a three-day tribute (April 23‚Äì25, 2015) to recognize the anniversary of the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v.

It was directed by King Vidor, and stars Barbara Stanwyck, John Boles, and Anne Shirley. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role. This was the second feature film adaptation of the novel. The first was the 1925 silent film version titled Stella Dallas, while it was also remade in 1990 as Stella. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. Plot Stella Martin, the daughter of a mill worker, Charlie, in a post-World War I Massachusetts factory town, is determined to better herself. She sets her sights on mill executive Stephen Dallas and catches him at an emotionally vulnerable time. Stephen's father killed himself after losing his fortune. Penniless, Stephen disappeared from high society, intending to marry his fianc√©e, Helen Morrison, once he was financially able to support her. However, just as he reaches his goal, he reads in the newspaper the announcement of her wedding. So he marries Stella. A year later, their daughter, Laurel, is born. To Stella's great surprise, she discovers she has a strong maternal instinct. Even when she is out dancing and partying, she cannot help but think about her child. As Laurel grows up, Stella's ambition and scheming to rise socially is redirected to her daughter. Stephen dotes on Laurel as well, but she is the only bond between husband and wife. He tries to help Stella become more refined, but without success. He also strongly disapproves of her continuing friendship with the vulgar Ed Munn. Finally, when Stephen receives a promotion that requires him to move to New York, Stella tells him he can go without her or Laurel; they separate, but remain married. Laurel stays with her mother, but visits her father periodically. Years later, Stephen runs into Helen, now a wealthy widow with three sons. They renew their acquaintance. Laurel is invited to stay at Helen's mansion; she gets along very well with Helen and her sons. Stephen asks Stella for a divorce, but she turns him down. Stella takes Laurel to a fancy resort, where Laurel meets Richard Grosvenor III, and they fall in love. However, when Stella makes her first appearance after recovering from an illness, she becomes the target of derision for her vulgarity, though she herself is unaware of it. Embarrassed for her mother, Laurel insists they leave at once without telling her why. On the train back, Stella overhears the truth. Stella goes to talk with Helen. After learning that Helen and Stephen would marry if they could, she agrees to a divorce and asks that Laurel go live with them. Helen realizes the reason for the request and agrees. When Laurel learns of the arrangement, she refuses to put up with it and returns home. However, Stella has been notified by a telegram and is ready for her. Stella pretends that she wants Laurel off her hands so she can marry Ed Munn and travel to South America. Laurel runs crying back to her father. Later, Laurel and Richard get married. Stella watches them exchange their wedding vows from the city street through a window. Her presence goes unnoticed in the darkness and among the other curious bystanders. She then slips away in the rain, alone but triumphant in having arranged her daughter's happiness. Cast Production Tim Holt, the son of Jack Holt, had his first proper part in a film with Stella Dallas. He played the same role that was performed by another film star's son, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., in the 1925 version. Accolades At the 1938 Academy Awards, Barbara Stanwyck was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role and Anne Shirley was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg. Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. The agitprop play told the story of Tim Buck and his arrest as a Communist under Section 98 of the Criminal Code that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime. However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a prison riot when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way. The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at Toronto's Standard Theatre on December 4, 1933. The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in Winnipeg had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there. When the Progressive Arts Club had a meeting to protest this censorship, a former minister, A. E. Smith, described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader. As a result, Smith was indicted for sedition, but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court. Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.

In most cases, such as in Northern Ireland and the Victorian County Courts, a county judge is a judicial officer with civil or criminal jurisdiction. In the United States, however, there are some \\"County Courts\\" which exercise primarily administrative functions, in which case the County Judge may exercise largely or solely executive authority and be equivalent to the county executive in other local government areas.  United States  County court systems are common in the United States, often led by a County Judge, but with jurisdiction varying between the states, and in many cases carry a mix of administrative law functions and executive responsibilities for governing the county. In Missouri, for example, the county court deals largely with property registration and deeds as well as leading the county - in 1922, Harry S. Truman was elected as one of two County Judges for Jackson County, Missouri, becoming the county presiding judge in 1926, his two elected positions prior to entering the United States Senate. In states like New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, the county courts conduct trials on misdemeanor, and even some felony, criminal matters. The blurring of executive and judicial functions has developed on a state-by-state basis in response to local needs and so there is little uniformity between states, and even within states at times (differing interactions of rural and urban/municipal jurisdictions with each other and with the state government, for example). Tennessee and Oregon both have county courts which are executive agencies, and which thus carry responsibility for funding local courts, jails, and Sheriff's departments, maintaining county roads, managing local property developments, and levying county-wide property taxes. In other areas, this body is often called a County Commission rather than being named a Court. In Kentucky, each county has the similarly-titled elected office of County Judge/Executive, who serves as the chief executive officer for the vast majority of counties. = Texas = In Texas, the County Courts have original jurisdiction established under sections 15 to 17 of Article V the State Constitution. Each of Texas's 254 counties has a single County Court which shall be a \\"court of record\\" (section 15) which \\"has jurisdiction as provided by law\\" (section 16), which is exclusive over \\"Class A\\" and \\"Class B\\" misdemeanors (offenses that can involve jail time), concurrent over civil cases concerning small to moderate amounts, and with appellate jurisdiction over justice of the peace and district / municipal court cases (involving a trial de novo if the lower court is not a \\"court of record\\"). An elected County Judge shall preside over the County Court for a four-year term (section 15) and have \\"judicial functions as provided by law,\\" who may be replaced in cases of judicial disqualification or recusal (section 16). Juries in criminal trials \\"shall consist of six persons; but no jury shall be empaneled to try a civil case unless demanded by one of the parties, who shall pay such jury fee therefor, in advance, as may be prescribed by law, unless the party makes affidavit that the party is unable to pay the jury fee\\" (section 17). Since the jurisdiction of County Courts and the judicial functions of the County Judge are both limited \\"by law\\" their extent is defined by legislative actions. County Judges do not require any formal qualifications in the discipline of law. Most are not qualified to practice law - in 2015, 42 of County Judges (17%) had graduated from Law school and only 40 (16%) were licensed to practice law. This can be problematic, but with a caseload well beyond the capabilities of a single person, the Texas Legislature has created County Courts-at-law where only qualified lawyers may preside, to which many of the judicial responsibilities of the County Judge have been transferred. Individual counties are free to strip the County Judge of all judicial responsibilities, but this has not occurred in most places; County Judges undertaking judicial activities draw a supplemental salary, and in 2011 the Houston Chronicle reported that 85% of counties had judges drawing this stipend. The judicial education officer at the Texas Association of Counties, David Hodges, has noted that the rate of cases being overturned is higher for both the County Courts-at-law and for District Court judges than it is for County Judges. Some County Judges view the County Courts-at-law as supplements to, rather than replacements of, the County Court's judicial functions and so choose to preside in some criminal matters. County Commissioners' Court Each Texas County is presided over by a Commissioners' Court of four County Commissioners and the County Judge, plus the County Clerk as a non- voting ex officio member. Despite the terms \\"Court\\" and \\"Judge,\\" the County Commissioners' Court has no judicial function, and although the County Judge presides over its meetings, the County Judge does not render judicial rulings. The Commissioners Court is just the title given in Texas to the county government, and County Judge the title given to the head of county government. This body is responsible for administration of the county, controlling the county tax rate, the budget for its responsible departments, and exercising oversight over subsidiary boards and commissions. The County Judge presides over meetings but has no veto power, Reviews and the court makes decisions by simply majority and is quorate with three voting members (except for levying tax where four members are required). Consequently, a County Judge is primarily the chief administrator for the county, effectively the chief executive officer, who exercises only limited judicial functions (varying between counties), though retaining the authority to conduct marriages and to conduct administrative hearings.

He represented a provincial ruling elite which was often at odds with the Ethiopian central government. Welle was born in Marto in Yejju Province. He was the son of Ras Welle Betul and the nephew of Empress Taytu Betul. His half-sister, Kefey Wale, was the second wife of Ras Mangesha Yohannes, the natural son of Emperor Yohannes IV.Prouty, Empress Taytu, p. 165 Prouty quotes Bairu Tafla's favorable opinion of Gugsa as \\"One of the most enlightened men of the Ethiopian nobility, a renowned poet, great lover of books, and pious and fair in the administration of Begemder.\\" Taytu Betul arranged the marriage of Gugsa Welle to Leult Zewditu, the eldest daughter of Emperor Menelek II and an earlier wife. They were married in 1900, six years before her elevation to Empress. Gugsa was her fourth husband.Chris Prouty, Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia 1883-1910 (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 220 With his marriage to Zewditu, Welle was immediately promoted to Ras over Begemder Province. Prouty indicates that this alliance allowed Empress Taytu to extend her influence over this important province. Despite the political nature of this marriage, the two were happy. However, in 1909, Welle was summoned to Addis Ababa by Menelek II to respond to the charge that he had mistreated Zewditu.Prouty, Empress Taytu, pp. 219ff Welle came close to becoming the power behind the throne during the intrigue that characterized the years of Emperor Menelik II's senility, for in 1909, the Empress Taytu made a serious effort to prevent the accession of Lij Iyasu as Menelik's successor. This led to the rumor that Empress Taytu and her brother, Ras Wale Betul, intended to move the capital to Gondar and make Welle the Emperor.Prouty, Empress Taytu, p. 325 However, the Shewan aristocracy agreed that their authority, positions and honors depended on obeying Menelik's wishes, and they united behind Lij Iyasu as the successor.Harold G. Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913, (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), pp. 236ff Despite this setback, Welle initially supported the resulting status quo: when Dejazmach Abraha Araya rebelled in Tigray, Gugsa supported Dejazmach Abate Bwalu who was sent to suppress this threat, helping him to defeat Dejazmach Abraha in the Battle of Lake Ashenge on 9 October.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 240 However, once Iyasu was secure as Emperor the following year, Ras Welle was arrested \\"on a murder charge so patently false that he ultimately regained his freedom.\\" By late April, he was in chains in Addis Ababa and \\"no longer a potential threat to the government\\".Marcus, Menelik II, p. 246 This confinement proved to be cruel. According to Prouty, Welle \\"was kept in chains for so long that his legs became swollen and the metal cut into his flesh\\". Zewditu begged Iyasu's short-lived Regent, Ras Tessema Nadew,Tessema Nadew died within a year of becoming Regent for Iyasu. to ease conditions for Welle. But it was not until 1915, when she was relegated to Falle, that Welle was released and the two were allowed to live together.Prouty, Empress Taytu, pp. 333, 340 In 1916, a successful coup d'√©tat against Iyasu resulted in his being deposed and Zewditu being proclaimed Empress. Iyasu's father, Mikael of Wollo, then invaded Shewa Province with an army to restore Iyasu. Mikael was defeated in the Battle of Segale. With Iyasu deposed, Zewditu became \\"Queen of Kings\\" and Empress of Ethiopia, and her young cousin Tafari Makonnen became heir to the throne and Regent of the Empire. Empress Zewditu and Welle were restored to good graces. But the Shewan leadership, leery of a resurgence of the influence of Dowager Empress Taitu and her family, forced Welle to separate from Zewditu and he was sent to Gondar where he served once again as Governor of Begemder. Welle also served as Governor of Semien at this time.Marcus, Haile Sellassie I, The Formative years: 1892-1936, (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), p. 28 The crowning of Tafari Makonnen was controversial. He occupied the same territory as Zewditu rather than occupying a far off region in the empire. In Ethiopian history two monarchs, even with one being the vassal and the other the Emperor (in this case Empress), had never occupied the same location as their seat. Conservatives, including Balcha Safo, agitated to redress this perceived insult to the Empress and to the dignity of the crown. This state of agitation ultimately led to Ras Gugsa's rebellion in 1930. Welle saw Zewditu remaining as Empress and himself as the future Emperor. However, Empress Zewditu did not authorize or openly support his rebellious actions. In January, Welle raised an army in Begemder. On 28 March, he marched from his governorate at Gondar towards the capital, but, on 31 March, he was met near the border by the Army of the Center (Mahel Sefari) and he was defeated and killed at the Battle of Anchem.Marcus, Haile Sellassie I, p. 95 News of his defeat and death had hardly spread through Addis Ababa when the Empress died suddenly on 2 April. Although it was long rumored that the Empress was poisoned on the defeat of her husband,Sorenson, John.

It had around 1,575 citizens in January 2017.Overzicht inwonersaantal Tytsjerksteradiel - Tytsjerksteradiel  History  Eastermar on a map from the Atlas Novus, ¬± 1630, using the historical Dutch name of Oostermeer (with a long s). The Burgumer Mar is shown as Bergmeer As early as 4000 BC there were nomads in this area. An important archaeological discovery was made at Burgumer Mar, a lake to the northwest of Eastermar. This discovery is known as the Leien- Warten Kompleks. Also found around Eastermar were mammoth teeth and gold rings, now in the Regional Museum in Burgum. The first farmers settled on the higher grounds east of the Burgumer Mar. Around 1200, the first stone church was built here, which was later known as the Protestant church of Eastermar. The community is believed to be several centuries older than the church. As shown on a 1605 map, originally the name Eastermar referred to this community, now It Heechs√¢n, a hamlet to the east of today's Eastermar. In the Middle Ages there were already several farms around the church and to the north and south of It Heechs√¢n. This 1605 map shows the ancient Burgumer Mar to the northwest of the village, but not yet De Leien, the lake to the south that came into being during the large-scale peat extraction that took place between 1500 and 1750. During this period, peat workers built a hamlet at the crossing point between a road and a waterway (Lits). This settlement, called De W√¢l, was a place of shipping, trade and craft and became the main centre in this area, eventually surpassing the older hamlet and assuming its name, Eastermar. After 1750, farming became dominant again in this area, and still is. Until 1989, the village had two formal names (as many Frisian places still do): Eastermar in West Frisian, and Oostermeer in Dutch. The local municipality decided on officially continuing under a single name in both Dutch and Frisian then; a change which is reflected in the single name on the town sign.

In his overview of 1980s action films, Daniel R. Budnik described the film as \\"the hybrid movie to end all hybrid movies\\", noting not just The Terminator and Blade Runner as influences, but that the plot also borrowed from Over the Top. Release Vendetta dal futuro passed Italian censors in 1986. The film has been released with the English titles of Atomic Cyborg and Hands of Steel. Reception From retrospective reviews, Hughes described Vendetta dal futuro as \\"the best example\\" of the films in-dept to The Terminator, noting its other influences of Blade Runner with a karate fighting android and praising an action sequence featuring lorries, cars and helicopters as well as the score.
