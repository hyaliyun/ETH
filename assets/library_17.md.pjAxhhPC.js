Career During the Panic of 1837, DuBois persuaded her father-in-law to open an empty warehouse to accommodate men left homeless by the economic downturn. In 1854 she and a doctor's wife, Anna R. Emmet, founded the Nursery and Child's Hospital, which focused on the needs of poor women and their small children.Ada Calhoun, St. Marks is Dead: The Many Lives of America's Hippest Street (W. W. Norton & Company 2015). The hospital fostered foundlings,Julie Miller, Abandoned: Foundlings in Nineteenth-century New York City (New York University Press 2008). offered daycare and wet nurses for the babies of working women, and was the first hospital in New York City to admit infants under two years of age. DuBois and Emmet ran the hospital with personal funds and energetic fundraising among her friends and in the wider community, including charity balls, until she successfully lobbied the New York state legislature for support. Her uncle, Edward Delafield, was the first president of the hospital's medical board, and a consulting physician there. She was an active hospital director; in 1870, DuBois fired pediatrician Abraham Jacobi from the hospital, when he published a letter critical of the hospital's policies. DuBois's hospital eventually merged with larger medical programs, and is now considered part of the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Despite the demands of her philanthropic efforts, a large household, and health issues (or perhaps because of her otherwise demanding life), DuBois pursued sculpture as a serious amateur.Sarah Burns, \\"Pantaloons vs. Petticoats: Gender and Artistic Identity in Antebellum America\\" in John Davis, Jennifer A.

The bridge was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1912. The bridge is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss bridges Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the New South Wales road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the NSW Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the NSW Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Harvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". Wollombi Brook bridge The bridge was built in 1911-12 by William Murphy and James Taylor over what was then known as Cockfighter Creek. In 2003-04, emergency works were undertaken including pier replacement, driving of new piles and a second row of piles.  Description  Bulga Bridge is a Dare-type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are three timber approach spans at one end and two at the other giving the bridge an overall length of . The super structure is supported by sheeted timber trestles and provides a carriageway with a minimum width of . A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge. The underside of the bridge deck has been strengthened with steel tension ties.  Heritage listing  The Bulga Bridge is a Dare-type timber truss bridge, and was completed in 1912. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. The Bulga Bridge is particularly technically significant because it has very large supporting trestles, has the rare feature of trussed cross girders, and is the largest span Dare truss bridge built. The bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Bulga Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Bulga Bridge over Wollombi Brook was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Highly rare - contains several important technical features.

Specifically, the orbiter mission would study an enigmatic ultraviolet light absorber of unknown composition situated within the planet's uppermost cloud layer that absorbs about half the solar radiation downwelling in the planet's atmosphere. The mission concept is still in its early formulation stage. The Principal Investigator is Valeria Cottini, at the University of Maryland in College Park. Overview As seen in the ultraviolet, Venus is striped by light and dark areas indicating the abundance of an unknown absorber in the planet's top cloud layer. UV image obtained by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 CUVE is a concept mission proposed to NASA that would orbit Venus to measure the ultraviolet light absorption and airglow emissions in order to understand the planet's atmospheric dynamics.NASA studies CubeSat mission to solve Venusian mystery.

Piccioni. NASA. 2017. CUVE is one of ten proposed missions to study Solar System planets and asteroids, selected by the agency under the Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program, managed by NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The mission was proposed to NASA and it was selected in 2017 for further conceptual development.NASA Selects CubeSat, SmallSat Mission Concept Studies. NASA Press Release. 23 March 2017. The team is led by the University of Maryland with collaboration from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Catholic University of America, and the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy. In order to increase launch opportunities CUVE technical requirements are based on reaching Venus as secondary payload of a planetary mission, including missions that are not targeting Venus, or a launch of an Earth-orbiting mission. Science The Venusian upper cloud deck, situated at an altitude range 60–70 km, is formed of small droplets comprising a mix of ~80% sulfuric acid () and water. About half of the solar energy received by Venus is absorbed in the UV by a still unknown absorber situated at the top of the cloud layer. Because of its vast absorbing power, knowing its nature is very important to understand the overall radiative and thermal balance of the planet and the atmospheric dynamics. CUVE – CubeSat UV Experiment: Unveil Venus' UV Absorber with CubeSat UV Mapping Spectrometer. (PDF) V. Cottini, Shahid Aslam, Nicolas Gorius, Tilak Hewagama. Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, at The Woodlands, Texas, USA, Volume: LPI Contrib. No. 2083, 1261. March 2018. Although NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, and Japan's JAXA have dispatched multiple missions to Venus, the nature of the cloud top absorber has not been established. As of 2018, some candidate chemical species have been proposed to explain the spectral contrast features in the UV: SO2, FeCl3, Cl2, Sn, SCl2, S2O, elemental sulfur, and disulfur dioxide dimer (). It has also been speculated that any hypothetical microorganisms inhabiting the upper atmosphere, if present, could employ ultraviolet light emitted by the Sun as an energy source, and could cause the observed UV absorption. Objectives The primary objective of this mission is to understand the nature, concentration, and distribution of the unidentified UV absorber (peak at 365 nm), and provide clues to identifying its composition and source. It will also study the Venusian atmospheric UV airglow, abundance of trace gases, and cloud-top atmospheric dynamics. The secondary goal is to assess the efficacy of miniaturized instruments in a CubeSat in producing useful scientific measurements in Venus' harsh environment while in proximity to the solar radiation field. Spacecraft CUVE would be a 12-unit CubeSat microsatellite with an approximate mass of . Science payload The small orbiter would carry two science instruments integrated to a small telescope: *a multi-spectral UV imager (320-570 nm; 4 nm spectral resolution) to add contextual information and capture the contrast features. This UV camera type is a Linear Variable Filter Imager. *a miniaturized high-resolution ultraviolet spectrometer developed by NASA Goddard to analyze a broad spectral band (190-380 nm; 0.2 nm spectral resolution) covering the ultraviolet and visible regions. The spectrometer is a Low scattering Czerny Turner design. *a lightweight UV telescope 80 mm in diameter, featuring a novel carbon nanotube light-gathering mirror in an epoxy resin. The mirror, developed by contractor Peter Chen, is extremely light and its fabrication does not require polishing, as it is coated with a reflective material of aluminum and silicon dioxide.

It is only known from the type specimen, which was collected near Mong Yaw, Myanmar. Description The only specimen of P. nutans was described as follows: tall with an erect, glabrous stem. It has 5 membranous, nerved sheaths, also glabrous. No leaves were included with the specimen, probably due to the general absence of leaves during flowering, similar to other Pachystoma and Eulophia species. The raceme is long with 2 nodding flowers. The pedicel (botany) and ovary are long and white-pubescent. The flowers are pale cream, faintly flushed with pink, with a bright yellowish- green lip. The dorsal sepal is puberulous on both surfaces, elliptic-oblong, long and across, with 5 nerves. The lateral sepals are similar to the dorsal, but oblique. The petals are linear, acuminate at the apex, puberulous, long, and across, with 3 nerves. The lip is orbicular-ovate in outline, constricted slightly below the middle, forming three large lobes.

Background Oliver Carlson was born on July 31, 1899, in Gutland, Sweden. In 1919, he was a member of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. He studied law for one year at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Career YPSL In 1914, Carlson joined the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) while living in the Muskegon and Detroit, Michigan, areas. In 1918-1919, Carlson served as YPSL national secretary. YWL and YCL After the Communist Party formed in 1919 in the US, Carlson became a communist. During Winter 1920-1921, Carlson (as \\"H. Edwards\\") attended a second convention of the United Communist Party in Kingston, New York, which voted to establish the \\"Young People's Communist League.\\" In April 1921, he attended a congress in Germany of the Young Communist International, where he received funding. The meeting then moved to Moscow, which Carlson (as \\"Tucker\\") attended. In January 1922, as the Workers Party of America formed, the Party agreed to found a National Organizing Committee (NOC) for the Young Workers League of America (YWL), with Carlson as secretary. The group started a second publication called Youth, soon changed to The Young Worker with Carlson as both YWLA secretary and Young Worker editor, Martin Abern as secretary, and Harry Gannes as business manager. In May 1922, the Young Communist League of America (YCLA) formed at an underground gathering, to which Max Bedacht spoke. The group published Young Communist quarterly during 1922. In July 1922, Carlson visited to comrades in Gary, Indiana. In January 1924, Carlson, now ex-editor, gauged circulation of the Young Worker at 7-8,000 copies per issue. After attending the 4th world congress of the Young Communist International, leadership shuffled, with three secretaries (John Williamson, Martin Abern, and Carlson), Max Shachtman as editor, and Abern and Carlson as heads of the education department (among other positions). Communist Summer Schools In 1925, Carlson became head of Communist Summer Schools, sponsored by the Workers Party of America. During Summer 1926, the Young Workers League of America (YWL) ran several pioneer camps and summer schools: Chicago, Waino, Wisconsin; Waukegan, Illinois, and Winchedon, Massachusetts. During Summer 1927, the YWL ran four schools in Boston, a town in Ohio, Waino, and Winlock, Washington. Carlson directed the Winlock school. During 1928, Carlson directed a YWL school in Woodland, Washington. CLA In 1928-9, Carlson joined the Communist League of America (CLA), headed by James P. Cannon, Max Shachtman, and Martin Abern. CLA members had been expelled from the Communist Party USA for Trotskyism as \\"Cannonites.\\" He was one of the CLA \\"Musteites,\\" other being Louis F. Budenz, Arnold Johnson, J.B.S. Hardman, and Benjamin Mandel. By late 1931, Carlson was out and seeking readmission to the CLA: he would not gain re-admittance. (In 1934, the CLA folded into A.J. Muste's American Workers Party to form the Workers Party of the United States.) University of Chicago In 1930, Carlson taught political science department at the University of Chicago, where \\"I made a special study of the propaganda techniques of the Communist movement both abroad and in this country.\\" During 1939-1940, he studied \\"the problem of Communism\\" in the state of California, which he published as A Mirror for Californians in 1941. According to Carlson in 1947, \\"has a good deal of information about the Communist movement in California, and in one chapter dealing with Hollywood I devote a part of that chapter to a discussion of the Communist infiltration in Hollywood up to that time.\\" Carlson then read several pages from a chapter in the book called \\"There Is No Town Called Hollywood.\\" (A May 1941 review in the New York Times reports that the book focuses on four main actors in California history: Denis Kearney, Hiram Johnson, Upton Sinclair, and Francis Townsend and also discusses Harry Bridges.) HUAC As early as 1944, Carlson's name appears among others listed by the Legislature of the State California as \\"friendly witnesses.\\" Others include Earl Warren. On October 24, 1947, during hearings before the House Un-American Activities Committee, Carlson described himself as a writer and teacher, residing in Los Angeles. He told the committee, \\"I specialize in the field of political science, more particularly in the field of propaganda techniques. I have worked in that field for about 20 years or more.\\" He testified that the Communist Party had sent people from New York to \\"run\\" Hollywood. He named V.J. Jerome and Eli Jacobson. He described Jacobson in detail: New Yorker, \\"charter member of the Communist Party,\\" and associated in Los Angeles of film director Beryl La Cava and magazine editor Kyle Crichton. In the mid-1920s, Jacobson was a director of the New York Workers School, whose teachers included: Alexander Trachtenberg, William Z. Foster, Jack Stachel, and William W. Weinstone. Regarding communism and teaching, Carlson testified that William Wolfe of the ILGWU education department ran a People's Education Center, succeeded by Sidney Davison (sent from New York). Herbert Biberman taught there (Soviet theater), as did Guy Endore Robert Lees. Advisors included Lees, Lawson, Healey, Herbert Sorrell, Frank Tuttle, and Sondra Gorney. Later life In 1985, Carlson was living in Carlsbad, California. Personal life and death Mrs. Oliver Carlson was a sponsor of the Hollywood League of Women Shoppers, along with Frances Farmer, Lillian Hellman, Mrs. Boris Karloff, and others. Oliver Carlson died aged 91 on March 4, 1991, in California.

Bourbon County was created by Georgia in 1785 as part of the Yazoo land scandal out of disputed Yazoo lands in present-day Mississippi and was dissolved in 1788 due to pressure from the federal government.  History  In 1785, Georgia Governor George Mathews signed the Bourbon County Act, which organized Bourbon County, Georgia in the area east of the Mississippi River, south of the Yazoo River, east of various Native American lands and the north of the 31 degree parallel of latitude. At this time the western boundary of the State of Georgia was at the Mississippi River (per the 1763 Treaty of Paris). This area included part of the Natchez area and was also in part of an area that was also claimed by Spain. Bourbon County was created on February 7, 1785. Thomas Green attempted to assemble and organize Bourbon County, but Spanish authorities resisted his efforts to occupy the territory due to the fact that the county occupied area also claimed by Spain. The State of Georgia appointed civil and judicial officers for the new county, but under pressure from the federal government, the Georgia General Assembly repealed the act creating Bourbon County on February 1, 1788 with the intent to reduce diplomatic tensions with Spain. The federal government opposed the existence of Bourbon County because of the unresolved Spanish claim, and because claims to the area by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Native American tribes had existed previously. It was believed that Bourbon County was named for the House of Bourbon, the famed ruling family of France.

The Bosporan era (BE or AB), also called the Bithynian era, Pontic era or Bithyno-Pontic era, was a calendar era (year numbering) used from 149 BC at the latest until at least AD 497 in Asia Minor and the Black Sea region. It originated in the Bithynian Kingdom and was also used in the Pontic Kingdom and, for the longest time, in the Bosporan Kingdom. The calendar era begins with the assumption of the royal title by Zipoetes I of Bithynia in October 297 BC (in the Gregorian calendar), which marks the start of its year one.Jakob Munk Højte, \\"From Kingdom to Province: Reshaping Pontos after the Fall of Mithridates VI\\", in Tønnes Bekker-Nielsen (ed.), Rome and the Black Sea Region: Domination, Romanisation, Resistance (Aarhus University Press, 2006), 15–30. The Bosporan year began at the autumnal equinox. The earliest evidence for the use of the Bithynian era is some coins dating from 149/8 BC, when Nicomedes II overthrew his father, Prusias II. Since earlier Bithynian coins carry no date, it is possible that the calendar was invented on this occasion. The era was adopted in Pontus under Mithridates VI, who introduced it onto the Pontic coinage sometime before 96/95 BC, replacing the Seleucid era used up to then. Since Pontus and Bithynia were rivals at the time, the most likely date for the introduction of the Bithynian era into Pontus was during the brief alliance between the two countries during the invasion of Paphlagonia in 108 BC. The Bithyno-Pontic era fell out of use in northern Asia Minor following the Roman conquest in 63 BC. There is no evidence that it was suppressed by Roman authorities, rather the local authorities preferred to adopt new eras commemorating their joining the Roman province of Bithynia et Pontus. The province thus had several dating systems in use, including the Seleucid era, but the Bithyno-Pontic era was not among them. There is no evidence from Asia Minor of the Bithyno-Pontic era ever being used on anything other than coins. Inscriptions, however, survive from the northern shore of the Black Sea, the region that fell under the Bosporan Kingdom in the first four centuries AD. In the Bosporus, the era was used in conjunction with the months of the Macedonian calendar. The first Bosporan coins bearing the era are from the reign of Mithridates VI's son, Pharnaces II, who never controlled Pontus and whose kingdom was thus restricted to the Cimmerian Bosporus. His coins were minted in Bosporus, but were of the Pontic type. The first distinctly Bosporan coins, which bear Bosporan era dates, are from 281 BE (17/16 BC) and were issued by Queen Dynamis. The earliest inscription dated with the Bosporan era can be read either 325 BE (AD 29) or else 313 (17) and mentions the reigning king, Aspurgus. While the Bosporan series of coins ends with Rhescuporis VI in AD 341, the latest inscription is from 794 BE (AD 497/8).

According to the United States Northern Command, the operation is being conducted in order to prevent a potential border crossing of migrants from Central America. The existing National Guard Operation Guardian Support is also being reinforced. Background Units participating in border support operations include elements of the United States Army's 89th Military Police Brigade, pictured here in January 2018. Units involved will provide assistance to the United States Border Patrol (pictured). A Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota of the Missouri National Guard carrying officers of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector Mobile Response Team takes off from Marana, Arizona, during Operation Guardian Support in 2018. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, U.S. Army North commanding officer, speaks with personnel deployed to Texas as part of border support operations on October 31, 2018. U.S. soldiers lay defensive wire along the banks of the Rio Grande River near Hidalgo, Texas, on November 2, 2018. In early October 2018, several thousands of people fled gang violence from the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) on an overland journey north in three separate groups colloquially referred to them as \\"caravans\\". According to some in the caravans, their intention was to cross through Mexico and later into the U.S. border. In response to the northward migration, and according to Newsweek, U.S. President Donald Trump eventually made his decision to take a hard-line stance against illegal immigration on the Mexican border. Timeline In April 2018, President Donald Trump ordered Operation Guardian Support, consisting of National Guard forces voluntarily contributed by states, to assist the United States Border Patrol in ongoing border security efforts. In October 2018, what was then known as Operation Faithful Patriot was initiated to provide U.S. military assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the southwest United States in confronting the approaching caravans. Trump ordered the operation on October 26, 2018, and United States Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis signed the deployment authorization later that day. According to General Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy of the United States Northern Command, the operation involves the deployment of federal troops \\"to harden the southern border\\" and augment the National Guard forces already involved in aiding the CBP authorities along the United States' southwestern frontier. By October 29, 2018, approximately 800 soldiers of the initial contingent had been deployed, with military officials confirming the remainder would be in place by the end of that week. Citing an unnamed source, KQED-FM reported the forces were being moved to marshaling areas in California, Texas, and Arizona and, from there, would respond to CBP positioning requests. In addition, the operation called for the supply of United States Army-owned anti-riot gear to the CBP. On November 7, 2018, the Pentagon announced that the name Operation Faithful Patriot was no longer in use. Instead, the current deployment of troops will be simply referred to as \\"border support.\\" Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ordered the name change the previous day because the original name had \\"political overtones.\\" The bulk of the troops arrived in Texas which is hundreds of miles away from the caravans arriving in Tijuana. Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, federal troops are prohibited from carrying out law enforcement duties.. During border support activities, they are not allowed to detain migrants or seize drugs. They have assisted the Border Patrol by maintaining vehicles. Other duties have included using military helicopters to carry border patrol agents to and from locations along the U.S.-Mexico border and operating cranes to install towering panels of metal bars. They have also strung concertina wire and wrapped it around barriers to reinforce the border. On January 31, 2019, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan announced that additional troops, likely several thousand, would be deployed to the border. The deployment was expanded to roughly 6,000 troops, drawn from the Marines, Army, Air Force and Navy, and their stay was extended through September 2019. By March, a plan was being prepared to ask the Defense Department for more federal troops to help with migrant processing, transportation and medical care in high-crossing areas. The draft plan includes using Defense Department land to house migrants in detention sites. On March 23, 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic across the U.S. and worldwide, Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell said that the Pentagon “has no plans to pull units off the border for coronavirus response” and the Defense Department confirmed that the troops at the border were authorized to stay there through September 30, 2020. Units assigned As of October 29, 2018, a full list of units participating in border support operations had not been released, but activated forces were said to include military police, in addition to combat aviation, combat engineer, medical, and civil affairs units totaling approximately 5,000 U.S. soldiers and 2,000 National Guard troops who are already deployed as part of the existing Operation Guardian Support. A surge force consisting of an additional 7,000 troops had been placed on \\"24-hour notice\\" to reinforce the frontier if those personnel proved inadequate.

During the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Syrian Civil War, it has served as a highly strategic military position because it overlooks wide areas of the Golan Heights and Hauran regions. The closest population center is the town of al-Hara, located at the hill's southeastern foot. Description Tell al-Hara is a conical-shaped tell (mound or hill) with an elevation of above sea level.Shahid 2002, p. 224, n. 23. Like the neighboring hills, Tell al-Hara belongs to the range of extinct volcanoes of the Jaydur region and a wide crater opens at its summit.Schumacher 1897, p. 192. It is the highest point in the Daraa Governorate, and overlooks the Hauran plain. At the southeastern foot of Tell al-Hara is the town of al-Hara.Ma'oz 2008, p. 9. Damascus is 50 kilometers north of Tell al-Hara, the governorate capital Daraa is 55 kilometers to the south, the district capital al-Sanamayn is 18 kilometers to the east and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is 12 kilometers to the west. Name Tell al- Hara was known as \\"Jabal Ḥārith\\" in the late Byzantine era.Shahid 2002, p. 80 It was named after the Ghassanid king al-Harith and was referred to as \\"Ḥārith al-Jawlān\\" by the contemporary Arab poets al-Nabigha and Hassan ibn Thabit. The modern name of the tell and the town at its foot, \\"al-Ḥāra\\", is a \\"mutilated\\" version of its Ghassanid name \\"al-Ḥārith\\", according to historian Irfan Shahîd. The tomb of the Ghassanid king al-Nu'man ibn al-Harith was said to be located at the summit of Tell al-Hara by al-Nabigha, though the scholarly consensus places al-Nu'man's tomb in the village of al-Hara. History In the 1890s, the German archaeologist Gottlieb Schumacher noted that the tomb of a certain Muslim saint, Umar al-Shahid, \\"crowned\\" Tell al- Hara. He also noted that at the hill's western foot were the ruins of an Arab monastery known as Deir al-Saj, which he suspected was of Ghassanid origin. Following Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights in 1967, Tell al-Hara served as a strategic Syrian reconnaissance point overlooking the Golan Heights. It was captured by Syrian rebel forces fighting under the banners of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and Jabhat al-Nusra from the 7th Armored Division, one of the largest armored brigades of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in southern Syria, on 5 October 2015, partially as a result of the apparent defection of SAA general Mahmoud Abu Araj. Tell al-Hara's capture paved the way for the rebels' capture of much of the western Daraa Governorate and the southern Quneitra Governorate. They held Tell al-Hara for about four years until Syrian government forces retook control of the hill on 7 July 2018 after a two-day battle. Rebels apparently recaptured it before surrendering the hill to government forces in a reconciliation agreement on 16 July.

She is the sister of Turkish poet and writer Umit Aktas. Best known for her short story collections, Aktas has published more than forty books of fiction and non-fiction, including her best seller novel Write Long Letters To Me and her well-researched commentary book The Poetry of the East : Iranian Cinema which is an academic favorite on the subject. She was a political newspaper columnist in 1980's, focusing her research papers and articles on women who experienced a traumatic social transformation in Turkey; and has published several books on topics such as exploitation of women, gender and identity politics, and hijab in public space, as a hijabi woman herself. Aktas has been described as a \\"strong feminist in a minimalist sense\\" and her literary style as \\"impressionist fiction\\". Her female characters \\"do not give concessions on their identity\\" and \\"usually has reached the climax of a longlasting problem.\\" She is married with two children and currently lives in Istanbul.  Early life Aktas was born in Refahiye, a small town in the Erzincan Province of Turkey. Her father Cemal Aktas, a public school teacher and a trade unionist, ran a bookstore in town, where Aktas fell in love with books from an early age. She graduated from Beşikdüzü High School of Education at 1978, and moved to Istanbul with her family right after, where she studied Architecture in Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University and graduated in 1978.  Career After graduating from university, Aktas worked as an architect, media consultant and journalist.

Today, she continues to write columns in weekly newspaper Gerçek Hayat and online outlets such as Dünya Bülteni, Hayal Perdesi and Son Peygamber. Her first novel Write Long Letters to Me, a semi-autobiographical book set in a boarding high school was published in 2002, subsequently becoming the recipient of Turkish Writers' Society's Novel of the Year Award. Both Write Long Letters to Me and her second novel Someone Who Listens To You have been described as period novels. Her critically acclaimed novel Shirin's Wedding published in 2016, is a modern interpretation of Persian Poet Nizami's Khosrow and Shirin, telling the story of a love triangle with the backdrop of complicated social and political controversies of 2000's Turkey. Aktas lived in Iran and Azerbaijan for many years due to her marriage, and the experience influenced both her literary style and subjects of interest. She published essays and research books about Iran such as The Poetry of the East : Iranian Cinema (1998), Revolutionaries of Yesterday, Reformists of Today (2004) and The Neighboring Stranger (2008). During her years in Iran, she taught Creative Writing and Turkish literature lessons at the Allameh Tabataba'i University.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Basement rock is only exposed at the surface in three places on the Turkmenistan plain. Shale with lenses of spilite, jasper- like rocks and silicified limestone outcrops in the center of the Tuarkyr elevation. Together with gabbro, serpentinized pyroxenite and diabase and numerous radiolarian fossils, they form an ophiolite mélange from the Paleozoic, overlain by four kilometers of sandstone, clay, tuff and conglomerate. Late Paleozoic igneous rocks are exposed on the Krasnovodsk Peninsula, including granite, gabbro and acid volcanic rocks dating to 450 to 350 million years ago. The third exposure is on the left bank of the Amudarriya River, where 285 to 280 million year old cataclastic granite intrudes Devonian clay and carbonate sediments. Precambrian schist, amphibolite and gneiss, Middle Paleozoic granite, gabbroid, metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rocks and Late Paleozoic intrusives are known through drillholes in the South Turan Platform. Geologists divide the platform basement into Precambrian massif and fold zones related to the Hercynian orogeny. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Sedimentary rocks formed during the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenozoic overlie the South Turan Platform. In the Murgab depression and Cis-Kopetdag, they reach up to eight to 10 kilometers thick, although average thickness is one to two kilometers. Turkmenistan has tectonically complex uplands, often separated by shallow deeps. Rhaetic and Liassic age Alpine cover rocks on the South Turan Platform lies unconformably atop folded basement rocks. These are mainly sand and clay layers deposited in a nearshore environment, often with coal layers. Late Jurassic deposits include a 60-meter clay and marl unit, an 800-meter carbonaceous unit and an upper 1.2-kilometer salt-bearing sequence. Jurassic sediments are up to three kilometers thick in the South Turkmenistan subsidence system. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) In the Paleocene and the Eocene, the North Mesotethys Ocean closed, forming the Shachrud-Nishapoor thrusted-folded arc and the Eastern Iran transverse folded system. This led to the incorporation of Turkmenistan, Iran and Afghanistan into the larger Eurasian Plate. As Gondwana moved northward and interacted with Eurasia in the Paleogene, subduction began south of the current Zagros Mountains in northern Iraq and Iran. As the North Mesotethys Ocean basin was subducted, it kicked off calc-alkaline volcanism in Iran in the Eocene. The Badkhys volcanic rocks and Great Balkhan bentonites on the Turan Plate in Turkmenistan are remnants of the inland extent of this subduction and volcanism. The collisions uplifted a large area across Eurasia as the Alpine- Asiatic mobile belt. Regionally, this uplift resulted in the Turkmen-Khorasan and Afghan-Tien Shan folded regions. The Southern Turkmen sutural zone, a linear area with wrench-dislocations is forming in the southwest along the Turkmen-Khorasan fold system. Throughout the Miocene deep troughs filled with molasse deposits two kilometers to as much as eight kilomters thick (in the case of the West Turkmenian Basin). During the Pliocene and Quaternary, the level of the Caspian Sea has varied widely. In fact the level of the Caspian basins dropped up to 500 meters. This has tended to deep paleo-valleys as downcutting took place. Turkmenistan is highly seismically active, especially around the Kopetdag-Balkhan deep fault zone. Natural resource geology Oil and gas are the dominant natural resources in Turkmenistan, with over 50 deposits discovered before the end of the 20th century. The West Turkmen Depression, also known as the Transcaspian Depression, is the main oil- producing area primarily from Pliocene rocks. Intensive oil extraction began in the 1940s, reaching 16 million tons by 1973. After Russia, the US and Canada, Turkmenistan is the fourth largest natural gas producer in the world. Most gas reserves are held in structural traps in Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleocene rocks in the East Turkmenistan Turan Platform, at depths of 1.5 to five kilometers, within uplifts of the Turkmen Anteclise and Amudarija Syneclise. The Murgab Depression is the single most productive area for gas, with the massive 1.8 trillion-cubic-meter Dauletabad-Donmez gas field and 300 billion-cubic-meter Naip field. In addition to gas deposits, Turkmenistan has the largest bromine and iodine reserves in the world as well as Karabogasgol Bay with large reserves of mirabilite and sodium sulfate. The eastern region of Guardak-Kugitang has abundant potassium salt, halite and sulfur, while the Oglanly deposit in Great Balkhan in Eocene sediments is a major supply of bentonite. Keramsite and other material is mined for construction. Hydrogeology Oases supply the cities of Cis-Kopetdag and Tedzhen-Murgab with drinking water and groundwater is widely extracted for use in the arid oil fields, particularly the Yaschan freshwater aquifer at Uzboy. Turkmenistan has mineral water springs at Archman, Ashkhabad and Bayram-Ali.

It has been catalogued in the Roud Folk Song Index, as number 3024. It has been recorded and sang publicly by numerous Irish folk singers. The meaning of the song has been debated, but may refer to the displacement of native Irish farmers from their traditional lands during the reign of Oliver Cromwell, owing to the fact that some versions reference Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan, a Jacobite leader during the 17th century. Moreover, the location of the eponymous Rocks of Bawn has been a source of discussion and curiosity for many years. Frank McNally of the Irish Times attempted to locate them, and decided that multiple sites could be considered, but the song's age precluded answering with any certainty.

Her debut novel, She Would Be King, was published by Graywolf Press in September 2018, and was named a best book of 2018 by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, Entertainment Weekly & BuzzFeed. The novel was positively reviewed by Time Magazine, The New York Times, and The New Yorker. Moore has published work in The New York Times, The Paris Review, Guernica Magazine, The Atlantic, and other journals. She was awarded a Lannan Literary Fellowship for fiction in 2019. In 2011, Moore founded a publishing house and nonprofit organization, One Moore Book, which publishes and distributes books intended for children in countries underrepresented in literature. Life Moore was born in 1985 in Liberia. She is one of five siblings. She is of mixed Vai, Gola and Americo-Liberian ancestry. Her mother is professor of English and Founding Dean of Liberia Honors College at the University of Liberia. Her father is professor of engineering and Dean of The College of Engineering at the University of Liberia. When she was five years old, Moore's family fled their home in Monrovia to escape civil war. Along with her father and sisters, Moore wandered for weeks in the forest, eventually finding shelter in her maternal grandmother's rural village. To protect the children from the horrors of the war, Moore's father and grandmother created a magical narrative for them in which gunshots were \\"dragons fighting\\" and dead bodies were \\"people sleeping on the road\\". At the time, Moore's mother Mamawa was studying at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, and had no news of her family's fate. Mamawa flew to Sierra Leone, where she eventually found a female fighter who was able to locate the rest of the family and bring them across the border. Subsequently, the Moore family moved to Houston, Texas. There, Moore read and wrote prolifically, which she credits with helping her overcome the trauma she experienced during the war. Moore attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for theater, before transferring and obtaining her bachelor's degree in journalism from Howard University. She also holds an MFA in creative writing from the University of Southern California and an MA in anthropology and education from Columbia University. She currently lives in Brooklyn, New York. Moore cited Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Isabelle Allende, Ben Okri and Salman Rushdie as inspirations. She has also credited Liberian poet Patricia Jabbeh Wesley as a literary inspiration. One Moore Book One Moore Book, launched in 2011, is a publishing company and nonprofit founded by Moore and her siblings to provide culturally relevant books to children who are underrepresented in literature and live in countries with low literacy rates. \\"The goal of the company is to provide books to children who rarely see themselves in books. Our books also serve the dual purpose of giving children here a glimpse of countries they may never have an opportunity to visit,\\" Moore said in an interview. The initial books were written by Wayétu and her sister Wiande, and illustrated by her sister Kula and brother Augustus. These books served as a pilot series for the organization's model. One Moore Book later collaborated on a series of books with Haitian-American author Edwidge Danticat. They currently publish 23 titles, including books set in Liberia, Haiti, Brazil, and Guinea. One Moore Book sells books as well as distributing thousands of free books to children in target countries. Some of their titles are distributed through Scholastic Book Clubs. One Moore Book opened a bookstore called One Moore Bookstore in Monrovia in May 2015. It is the first bookstore in Liberia dedicated to selling recreational literature, and also allows visitors to read in the store. She Would Be King Ambassador Christine A. Elder. Moore's 2018 debut novel, She Would Be King, is set early in Liberia's history and is an example of magical realism, featuring protagonists with superhuman abilities. The novel received largely positive reviews. \\"Reading Wayétu Moore's debut novel, She Would Be King (Graywolf Press), feels a lot like watching a superb athlete's performance,\\" Bethanne Patrick wrote in Time Magazine. Lovia Gyarkye wrote in the New York Times: > She Would Be King is an ambitious and expansive novel that explores the > nuances of Liberian history...Ms. Moore skillfully reconsiders the idealism > of the early African-American settlers through their interactions with the > indigenous peoples and braids together intimate story lines centered around > universal themes: falling in love, defying familial expectations and the > difficulties of doing the right thing. A brief review in The New Yorker stated: \\"The force and the symbolism of myth pervade Moore's engrossing tale.\\" The novel was chosen by Sarah Jessica Parker as the fifth American Library Association Book Club Central pick in 2018. The Dragons, The Giant, The Women The Dragons, The Giant, The Women, a memoir, was published by Graywolf Press in June 2020. The book describes Moore's childhood experiences during the Liberian Civil War. In an interview prior to its publication, Moore said of the book: > maybe [it will] give a new perspective to the African war story that isn't > about some aid worker who came in and saved us, and we weren't in a refugee > camp.

In a review in The New York Times, Grace Talusan described the book as \\"immersive\\" and \\"exhilarating\\", writing: \\"This memoir adds an essential voice to the genre of migrant literature, challenging false popular narratives that migration is optional, permanent and always results in a better life...\\" Bibliography Source: *She Would Be King (novel) *The Dragons, The Giant, The Women (memoir) Children's Books: *1 Peking *A Gift for Yole *I Love Liberia *J is for Jollof Rice *Jamonghoie (written with Wiande Moore-Everett based on a story by Jassie Senwah-Freeman) *Kukujumuku References Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Americo-Liberian people Category:People of Americo-Liberian descent Category:Writers from Brooklyn Category:Howard University alumni Category:University of Southern California alumni Category:Liberian emigrants to the United States Category:Liberian people of Gola descent Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:People from Monrovia Category:Writers from Houston Category:American women writers Category:Liberian women writers ","title":"Wayétu Moore"},{"id":"58915298","text":"Victor Clarence Vaughan (October 27, 1851 – November 21, 1929) was an American physician, medical researcher, educator, and academic administrator. From 1891 to 1921 he was the dean of the University of Michigan Medical School, which rose to national prominence under his leadership. He also served as president of both the American Medical Association and the Association of American Physicians, founded multiple medical journals, and was a leader in standardizing state medical licensing exams throughout the country. Serving with the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War and World War I, he was instrumental in helping the military cope with the threats of typhoid fever and influenza. His views on eugenics and forced sterilization of criminals and the mentally disabled, while not unusual among medical professionals and academics of his time, have received criticism as misguided.  Early life and education  Victor Vaughan was born on October 27, 1851, in Mount Airy, Missouri. His parents were John Vaughan and Adeline Dameron; his paternal grandparents had immigrated from Wales in 1812, and his mother's family were of French Huguenot and English descent and traced their time in America to 1699. He received his early education at the home of a local physician, and when the physician moved away the community built a school—the Hazel Hill Academy—where Vaughan received the remainder of his education until college. During the Civil War, an officer in the Union home guards came to the area hoping to kill Vaughan's father as revenge for having served as the foreman of a jury that had convicted him of theft some years earlier. The officer and his men occupied the family home and made off with most of the family's belongings while John Vaughan hid out and made plans for his family to escape with him to southern Illinois, where they stayed from February to October 1865 before returning home. Vaughan attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri, in 1867, but he did not do well and withdrew after one semester before enrolling at Mount Pleasant College in Huntsville, Missouri, the following year. The college had just reopened following the Civil War and when Vaughan was 19 he became an instructor of Latin; a year later, after discovering a chemistry lab in a locked-up room at the college, he began teaching chemistry as well. He completed his degree requirements in 1871 but did not formally graduate until 1872 once the school had been reopened a full four years. He was the only one in his class who had satisfied the requirements for an A.B. degree, so he chose to graduate with a less-prestigious B.S. degree like the rest of his classmates. He quit teaching at Mount Pleasant College in February 1874 after instructors' salaries were cut in half, and a week later began teaching Latin and chemistry at Hardin College, where he remained for one semester.  Graduate education and early career  Based on the reputation of its faculty, Vaughan decided to enroll at the University of Michigan for graduate studies in biology, chemistry, and geology, and in September 1874 he and a classmate rode the Wabash Railroad to Ann Arbor. Due to his having taken a lesser degree from a relatively unknown school, President James B. Angell required him to interview with three professors before offering him a place in the graduate course: chemist Albert B. Prescott, botanist and meteorologist (and future president of the University of Washington) Mark W. Harrington, and geologist Eugene W. Hilgard. The three approved, and Vaughan became Hilgard's student assistant for the year, helping him categorize fossils. Hilgard invited Vaughan to go with him when he accepted a position at Berkeley in 1875, but Vaughan preferred to stay at Michigan. He wrote his master's thesis, The Separation of Arsenic and Antimony, and received his degree in June 1875. That December, he was appointed an instructor of physiological chemistry, replacing Preston B. Rose following the latter's dismissal as part of a growing controversy involving missing funds that would continue until 1881. He received his PhD in 1876 and wrote three theses: one entitled The Osteology and Myology of the Domestic Fowl, another on fossils, and a third again on the subject of arsenic and antimony. In September of that year he traveled to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and used the trip to purchase six new microscopes to replace the two useless ones previously available to students; having had no instruction in their use, he turned for help to an engineer of the commuter train between Jackson, Michigan, and Ann Arbor who was an amateur microscopist, and in turn trained his own students. Vaughan was nominated for promotion in 1877, but one of the university's regents accused him of atheism and refused to consider the promotion unless he denied it. Vaughan was not an atheist, but on principle refused to deny it, saying, \\"I decline to make a confession of faith ... The position concerns the teaching of science and has no relation to religious belief.\\" He did not receive the promotion, but his stance met with the approval of two well-known members of the faculty, astronomer James Craig Watson and dean of the law school (and chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court) Thomas M. Cooley. Watson published a local newspaper, and used it to excoriate the regents, while Cooley offered legal counsel if needed, and both men became friends of his.  Family  Vaughan married Dora Catherine Taylor in Huntsville, Missouri, on August 16, 1877. She was the daughter of a local merchant, George Warren Taylor. The Vaughans had five sons: Victor Clarence, John Walter, Herbert Hunter, Henry Frieze, and Warren Taylor Vaughan. All five sons served in the military during World War I, and the eldest, Victor C. Vaughan, Jr., drowned in France following the Armistice. Their fourth son, Henry Frieze Vaughan, named after long-time University of Michigan professor Henry S. Frieze, was co-founder and dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health.  Professor and dean at the University of Michigan  Vaughan continued his studies at the medical school and received his M.D. in 1878 as part of the last class to graduate from a 2-year curriculum before it became a 3-year program. He began a successful medical practice that lasted twenty years, but his primary interest remained in the laboratory. He was made an assistant professor in 1880, and in 1883 received a full professorship in physiological and pathological chemistry; he was the first to hold a chair of physiological chemistry—today known as biochemistry—in an American medical school.  Research  Vaughan's research was primarily in the areas of bacteriology and intoxication as the basis for disease, which he approached from a chemistry standpoint. He published over two hundred papers and books, and while many of his theories were later found to be incorrect, they were based on his experimental data.  Tyrotoxicons  Hundreds of cases of food poisoning caused by cheeses hit Michigan between 1883 and 1885, though none were fatal. Vaughan evaporated an alcoholic extract of a suspect cheese and ate some himself, noting mouth dryness and constriction of his throat. He purified it and noted a drop placed on his tongue caused burning, nausea, bowel pain, and diarrhea; he repeated this test both on himself and student volunteers. Purifying the substance further resulted in needle-shaped crystals he named tyrotoxicons. The name came from the Greek words for \\"cheese\\" and \\"poison\\", and he considered them to be a kind of ptomaine, then thought to be a type of chemical that caused food poisoning. An ice cream poisoning incident the following year confirmed his suspicions. An ad for Vaughan's nuclein solution Vaughan and Novy published a book in 1886, Ptomaines and Leucomaines, or the Putrefactive and Physiological Alkaloids, which grew to 604 pages by its third printing in 1896; this and numerous journal articles led to national attention for the university and recognition for Vaughan as a leading researcher on bacteriology. There were skeptics of the tyrotoxicon theory at the time, and the ptomaine theory itself began to lose credibility by the early 20th century, leading Vaughan to conclude in 1909 that, \\"practically nothing is known about the precise chemical nature of these bacterial poisons\\".  Nuclein  Vaughan became convinced that germicidal properties of serum was thanks to nuclein. He extracted nuclein from the blood of dogs and rabbits and tested it on animals, and found it made some rabbits immune to tuberculosis. He had similar results with anthrax, though others pointed out his solution of anthrax was probably too weak to make it a valid experiment. He tested nuclein on patients in his private practice, finding it effective on tonsilitis and other ailments. He believed he found success with it in treating tuberculosis, although a number of patients died anyway. George Dock, who treated many tuberculosis patients, tried the therapy for a couple years but did not find it very effective, calling it \\"something of a fad\\". Detroit pharmaceutical company Parke, Davis & Co., sold a nuclein therapy based on Vaughan's formulation from 1894 through at least 1913.  The Hygienic Laboratory  The germ theory of disease was not yet widely accepted in 1881 when Vaughan began teaching a new course he called Sanitary Science. He later renamed it Course on Hygiene and it covered topics such as germs, disease, antiseptics, quarantine, and vaccinations. In 1884 he petitioned the regents to establish a State Laboratory of Hygiene, but the request was denied. Later that year, Robert Koch published his four postulates and the germ theory of disease began to take on importance worldwide. Vaughan repeated his request in 1886 and this time the regents approved it; the following year, they requested $75,000 (about $1.8 million in 2016 terms) from the Michigan state legislature to fund the laboratory along with several other labs. After a lobbying effort by the university, professionals, pharmacists, and farmers, the legislature allocated $35,000 for the labs on June 24, 1887, and the university founded the Hygienic Laboratory, the first of its kind in the country. While the laboratory was being constructed in the summer of 1888, Vaughan and Frederick George Novy went to Europe to study bacteriology in Koch's laboratory in Berlin. In addition to attending lectures, they purchased a complete set of Koch's laboratory equipment for the new lab in Ann Arbor. Before returning home, Vaughan visited the laboratory of Louis Pasteur, where Novy had gone to take in additional study. The lab was completed in 1889 and moved to a larger space in 1903; until 1907 it served as the official public health laboratory for the state of Michigan. Master's and doctorate degrees in public health were added in 1911, and the lab itself evolved into a full department in 1902, eventually becoming the Department of Microbiology & Immunology in 1979.  Dean of the medical school  Vaughan was named dean of the medical school in June 1891 following the resignation of Corydon Ford, though Vaughan had effectively been acting dean since the elderly Ford's appointment in 1887. Several recent deaths, resignations, and dismissals meant he needed to fill four professorships in short order. Vaughan wanted to find professors who could perform research in addition to their teaching duties, a change from previous expectations. Detroit doctor and university regent Hermann Kiefer traveled with Vaughan to several eastern cities to find candidates. After a couple false starts, they hired George Dock away from the University of Pennsylvania; Dock stayed on the faculty for nearly twenty years. Vaughan hired John Jacob Abel in 1891 and, when he left in 1893 to join the just-opened medical school at Johns Hopkins, Arthur Cushny to replace him. Vaughan continued to build the faculty he wanted, and by the turn of the century it was considered as good as any school's in the country. Vaughan tightened admission requirements, only accepting students from high schools that had been certified by the University of Michigan or who had a comparable certificate from New York; it was still uncommon for students to have graduated from college before enrolling in the medical school. Starting in 1892, algebra, geometry, and French and German reading proficiency were all required skills. He expanded the curriculum from three years to four, in line with recent changes at Harvard, Columbia, and Penn. When it came to applicants, he was interested principally in academic qualifications and admitted both men and women. The number of Jewish students greatly increased in his time, and he recruited African-American students, which was very rare among white-dominated medical schools. He oversaw the opening of the university's first hospital in 1892, having testified before the legislature's appropriations committee several years previously to help secure the funds. The growing spread of rabies in Michigan beginning around 1900 prompted Vaughan to push for the establishment of a Pasteur Institute branch in the state, which was the first in the U.S. west of New York. Towards the end of Vaughan's tenure, poor planning and neglect of the hospital meant it did not compare favorably to newer ones on the east coast. He proposed, unsuccessfully, moving the clinical portion of the medical program to Detroit. In 1916 the regents asked the legislature for money for a new hospital, and Vaughan testified in favor of it, but the money was not appropriated until 1920. The internal medicine and surgery departments had no permanent leadership, and all attempts to fill the former had failed. Vaughan hired Hugh Cabot to lead the surgery department in 1919, and when Vaughan resigned in 1921, Cabot succeeded him.  Eugenics and sterilization  In the 1910s, Vaughan gave lectures at the university on the subject of eugenics. He believed that individuals exhibiting the \\"defective unit characters\\" of \\"alcoholism, feeblemindedness, epilepsy, insanity, pauperism and criminality\\" should be excluded from the \\"privilege ... of parenthood\\". He spoke in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1914 at a statewide conference sponsored by the Race Betterment Foundation, a center of the eugenics movement that had been co- founded by the cereal magnate John Harvey Kellogg. Vaughan served on the organization's central committee, and was also serving as president of the state health board. The year before, he had endorsed a forced-sterilization law enacted by the Michigan state legislature; the law was challenged and thrown out as unconstitutional, though a similar law later passed in 1923 resulted in the forced sterilization of more than 3,000 people in the state.  Associations, publishing, and government work  Vaughan was active in a number professional associations and governmental bodies. He was a leading member of the American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Medication Education in 1904 when it revised medical education standards to put them on a scientific footing, and served as president of the AMA from 1914 to 1915. In 1915, he helped found the National Board of Medical Examiners with the goal of bringing consistency to the chaotic nature of medical licensing exams by providing a trusted set of tests that state licensing boards could use. He personally administered the first set of exams in October 1916. He was appointed to the Michigan State Board of Health in 1883 and repeatedly reappointed through 1919, serving as president of the board for much of that period. He traveled extensively throughout the state in the course of his duties, logging 10,000 miles by railroad in the first six months of 1893 alone. He worked to establish a state laboratory to take over testing duties from his own Hygienic Laboratory in 1907 after the secretary of the University of Michigan had ordered him not to release reports to health officers who hadn't paid their fees. In 1915, he oversaw the creation of a traveling clinic to educate physicians throughout the state about the correct diagnosis of tuberculosis. The organizers of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago hired Vaughan as a consultant to ensure safe drinking water, given the city's high rates of typhoid fever; after deciding there was no way to purify enough Chicago city water for all the attendees, the commission he served on recommended building a pipeline from Waukesha, Wisconsin, and as a result there was no typhoid reported at the fair. Vaughan helped found several journals, one of which is still being published as of 2018. In 1879, he was the founder and first editor of Physician and Surgeon, a monthly journal devoted to articles for general practitioners. He worked with publisher C. V. Mosby to found the Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, with the purpose of publishing scientific research along with techniques for applying it for use by practitioners; Vaughan was its first editor starting with the inaugural issue in October 1915. His son Warren later took over as editor of the journal, which continues to publish today as Translational Research. The AMA began publishing a popular magazine called Hygeia in 1923 with Vaughan as its first editor; it was renamed Today's Health in 1950 and continued to be published through 1976. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1915. After President Woodrow Wilson asked the academy in 1916 to create a National Research Council (NRC), Vaughan was named a member of its executive committee at its formation that September. He was also named the head of the medicine and hygiene committee, and spent the seven months before the U.S. entered the war on topics such as water sterilization, smallpox and typhoid fever vaccinations, medical supplies, diagnostic labs, and ear protection for soldiers. When war was declared in 1917, he left the NRC to rejoin the military as part of the Council of National Defense .  Military service  Despite an abhorrence of war he attributed to his experience as a boy during the Civil War, Vaughan took leave of his academic duties twice in order to serve in the military, first in the Spanish–American War and then in World War I.  Spanish–American War  Victor C. Vaughan in Spanish–American War uniform, 1898 After the sinking of the Maine and declaration of war with Spain, Vaughan was asked by the University of Michigan's acting president, Harry Burns Hutchins, to speak at a student rally in the hopes of cooling the enthusiasm of students for leaving school and enlisting. Vaughan planned to oblige, but after listening to the speaker before him suggest that the students wait to see if enough unemployed men enlisted so that students wouldn't be needed, he became indignant and deviated from his planned remarks, saying, \\"God pity the country whose tramps must fight its battles ... I would rather see these walls crumble into dust than to see you hesitate when your country calls. You have duties to your parents, but your first duty is to serve your country.\\" Governor Hazen S. Pingree called Vaughan the next day to say he had read the speech and signed Vaughan's commission. His unit, the 33rd Michigan Volunteer Infantry, left May 28, 1898, for Camp Alger, and shortly thereafter for Cuba. Major Vaughan's unit sailed on the USS Yale, previously a luxury liner, to Siboney, Cuba; he chose its second-class dining room as his hospital and operating room. Within a week he briefly came under fire in the Battle of Santiago and was one of a dozen surgeons who treated over 1600 men in the aftermath; he received a citation for gallantry on the field of battle. Yellow fever broke out shortly afterwards, and Vaughan contracted it; he survived under the care of Major William Gorgas, but lost 60 pounds over the course of his illness and was sent to New York by way of Florida, despite an initial desire to stay in Cuba and continue working now that he had immunity to the disease.  The typhoid commission  When Vaughan reached New York, the Surgeon General appointed him and Major Edward Shakespeare to a commission headed by Major Walter Reed to investigate typhoid fever. Nearly 21,000 cases of typhoid fever had been reported among U.S. troops between May and September 1898, resulting in about 1,600 deaths out of about 273,000 soldiers who had served. The commission visited a number of army camps and frequently found unsanitary conditions, including latrines that flooded into areas where soldiers slept, transport of urine and feces in open tubs that splashed near living and food preparation areas, and poor handling of food supplies and food waste. Their research lasted through June 1899. Since Shakespeare died in 1900 and Reed in 1902, Vaughan was largely responsible for the two-volume final report published in 1904, which provided significant new understanding in how typhoid was spread by flies and direct contact, as well as in how to prevent it through proper sanitary techniques. He took up the study of typhoid for the military again in 1908, serving on a board that recommended compulsory anti-typhoid inoculations for troops. The combination of sanitation and vaccinations meant that of the 4 million troops involved in World War I, only 1,529 hospital admissions were due to typhoid fever.  World War I  Even with his distaste for war, Vaughan termed the delay in the United States joining World War I a \\"national disgrace\\". He and all five of his sons were commissioned in 1917. The Council of National Defense created the General Medical Board on April 2, 1917, and Vaughan was appointed to its executive committee along with Gorgas (by then the Surgeon General of the Army), three other officers, and five doctors: Surgeon General William C. Braisted, Surgeon General Rupert Blue, Admiral Cary T. Grayson, Franklin Martin, F. F. Simpson, William J. Mayo, Charles H. Mayo, and William H. Welch. Gorgas had successfully lobbied Congress to remove a prohibition on reserve medical officers being promoted above major, and Vaughan was soon promoted to colonel and put in charge of the communicable diseases division. Disease was a major problem with the early mobilization effort; measles was the leading cause of mortality in the army during 1917, and from September 1917 to March 1918 the death rate for pneumonia at the most populous army camps was twelve times that of the general population. Vaughan, Gorgas, and William H. Welch toured camps, finding overcrowding and poor facilities, and the publicity surrounding Gorgas's reports led Congress to hold hearings that led to increased medical staffing and some improvements in conditions. But the largest challenge the military faced was influenza. The outbreak of influenza, first at Camp Kearny in December 1917, and then at Camp Funston in March and April, became a major issue when thousands of troops became ill at Camp Devens in September, with nearly 750 dying. Vaughan and Welch were dispatched there to investigate. Vaughan observed that this strain of influenza, rather than attacking the very young and very old, was killing men in prime physical condition, leading him to warn, \\"If the epidemic continues its mathematical rate of acceleration, civilization could easily disappear from the face of the earth.\\" By the time the epidemic ran its course, over a million troops were afflicted with influenza, and 30,000 of them died; 675,000 people died in the United States as a whole.  Retirement and later life  Following his resignation as dean on June 30, 1921, Vaughan accepted a one-year appointment as chairman of the Division of Medical Sciences at the National Research Council. The Vaughans moved to Chevy Chase, Maryland for the duration of the appointment, until October 1922, during which time he also published a two- volume work, Epidemiology and Public Health. They then moved to Chicago while he helped launch Hygeia in 1923. They spent the following winter in Washington, D.C., and from October 1924 to May 1925 they made a cross-country trip from Florida to California to Portland, Oregon, and finally back to their cottage at Old Mission, Michigan. He returned to Washington in September 1925 to again head the Division of Medical Sciences, and the following year published his autobiography, A Doctor's Memories. Vaughan and his wife traveled to Tokyo in October and November 1926, when he was a delegate to the Third Pan-Pacific Science Congress, and also visited China and the Philippines. He suffered a mild stroke upon his return home, and never again regained full health. He died of a sudden heart attack in Richmond on November 21, 1929, at the age of 78.

The Twins did not have a major league affiliate. The team was named the \\"Twins\\" because of the close proximity of Vidalia and Lyons. The Vidalia-Lyons Twins advanced to the Georgia State League Finals in 1949. The Twins finished the regular season 54–66 (5th) in 1948, 72–65 (4th) in 1949 and 56–83 (7th) in 1950. After not having a team in 1951, the Vidalia Indians began play in the 1952 Class D Georgia State League as an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. The Vidalia Indians captured the 1952 Georgia State League championship, Vidalia finished 66–58 (3rd) in the 1952 regular season under Manager Frank \\"Bull\\" Hamons.

Stewart is an anthropological archaeologist, assistant professor of anthropology, and curator of Paleolithic archaeology at the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropological Archaeology. He is also an honorary research fellow at the Rock Art Institute of the University of the Witwatersrand. His research focuses primarily on prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies of Africa, especially southern Africa. He is particularly interested in determining when, how, and where humans developed adaptive plasticity. Brian Stewart has directed excavations of many sites, mostly in Lesotho and South Africa, among the most notable are Spitzkloof, Sehonghong, and Melikane. Education Brian Stewart received a Bachelors of Arts in Anthropology in 2000 from the University of Vermont. He went on to receive his M.St. with high distinction in 2001 and his Ph.D in 2008 from the University of Oxford. He completed his dissertation under the mentorship of Dr. Peter Mitchell, focused on a spatial analysis of the Late Stone Age campsite of Dunefield Midden in South Africa. After receiving his doctorate, Stewart was a Junior Research Fellow (2008-2012) and Postdoctoral Research Fellow (2010-2012) at the University of Cambridge. He went on to hold the title of Lecturer at Harvard University (2012-2013) before joining the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan at the rank of Assistant Professor and becoming Curator of Paleolithic Archaeology at the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropological Archaeology. Research Brian Stewart's research investigates the behavior plasticity of Stone Age people, focused primarily in southern Africa. Coastal-based research in southern Africa over the last few decades have brought much attention to this record, as archaeologists have documented diverse materials signatures of symbolic behaviors (beads, ochres, incised ostrich egg shells, etc.) dating to ~80,0000 years ago. Before this, symbolic behavior, though considered a hallmark of modern humans, was thought to have emerged as humans entered the challenging environments of Europe as they spread to that continent ~40,000 years ago. Stewart's work with colleagues is important in so much that it spreads the focus of Middle Stone Age research in southern Africa from nearly exclusively coastal cave sites to include the habitation of the highlands of Lesotho. Not only does this help overcome the geographical bias of the region's research to date, it provides a more holistic view of the lifeways of Middle Stone Age peoples, as these environments were far less favorable for human settlement, requiring unique social and technological adaptations. Thus, Stewart's research is imperative in that it investigates the behavioral plasticity of people during the first period of unequivocal evidence of symbolic expression and behavioral modernity. Awards Brian Stewart gained much notoriety in 2008 after winning the inaugural 'Dance your Ph.D.' competition with his interpretive dance depicting a hunter sharing the spoils of a kill with a chilled woman sitting at a campfire. In 2017, Stewart received a senior research grant from the Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Science of the National Science Foundation to conduct collaborative research on the human adaptation to high altitude. In that same year, Stewart, along with colleagues, received a Research and Exploration Grant from the National Geographic Society to conduct a disciplinary study the long-term human occupation of Nama Karoo desert in South Africa.

It was first formed from the 363rd Rifle Division in March, 1942. Soon after forming it provided a command cadre for the second formation of the 53rd Army in Kalinin Front. Later, in the fall of that year, the division provided most of its personnel and equipment to form the new 2nd Guards Mechanized Corps, and was then disbanded. In April, 1943, a new 22nd Guards was formed from the second formation of the 150th Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, and went on to serve for the duration in 10th Guards Army. This formation first saw service in Operation Suvorov, the summer offensive of Western Front that liberated Smolensk in late September, and then fought through the autumn and winter in grinding battles towards the city of Orsha. During the summer offensive of 1944 it helped break the Panther Line in western Russia and then advanced into Latvia, winning a battle honor for its part in the liberation of Riga, before ending the war in Lithuania, helping to contain the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket. It was disbanded shortly after the war. 1st Formation The 363rd Rifle Division became the 22nd Guards on March 17, 1942, the same day its \\"sister\\" division, the 361st, became the 21st Guards Rifle Division, both in Kalinin Front. Its order of battle was as follows: * 62nd Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1205th Rifle Regiment) * 65th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1207th Rifle Regiment) * 67th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1209th Rifle Regiment) * 48th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 926th Artillery Regiment)Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 51.

Karp Vasilyevich Sviridov remained in command from the 363rd, and would hold this position throughout the first formation, being promoted to major general on October 1. It was part of Kalinin Front during its entire first formation, beginning in 30th Army before being moved to 11th Army. In April the division supplied the officers and men to form a new headquarters for the re-formed 53rd Army. Beginning on October 15 the 22nd Guards, over the course of the next four weeks, had most of its men and equipment used to create the 2nd Guards Mechanized Corps, and when this was completed on November 16, the division was disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 51 2nd Formation On April 19, 1943, a new 22nd Guards Rifle Division was formed, based on the second formation of the 150th Rifle Division, in accordance with a decree of the STAVKA dated April 16. At the time, the division was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in the Moscow Military District. Its order of battle was very similar to that of the first formation, with several exceptions as follow: * 62nd Guards Rifle Regiment (from 469th Rifle Regiment) * 65th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 647th Rifle Regiment) * 67th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 756th Rifle Regiment) * 48th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 328th Artillery Regiment)Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 51. Note that Sharp mis-numbers the 756th Rifle Regiment as the 674th. * 432nd Antiaircraft Battery (until April 25, 1943) The division did not include a mortar battalion. It inherited the \\"Siberian\\" (sometimes \\"Siberian Volunteer\\") honorific from the 150th, but not the \\"Stalin\\" title. It was under the command of Col. Nikolai Olimpievich Ruz from the day of its conversion. By June 1 the division was in the 10th Guards Army's 19th Guards Rifle Corps along with the 56th and 65th Guards Rifle Divisions.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 133 It would remain in this Army, mostly under command of this Corps, for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 51 Operation Suvorov General layout of the Smolensk region during the battle.The Front's main effort was made between Yelnya and Spas-Demensk by 10th Guards and 33rd Armies. The 10th Guards' 15th and 19th Guards Corps were deployed on a 10km-wide sector between Mazovo and Sluzna; the 56th and 65th Guards Divisions were in the first echelon with the 22nd Guards in the second. Each division had about 8,000 personnel on strength. The 5th Mechanized Corps was assembled behind the Army, ready to exploit the expected breakthrough. The operational objective for the first day of the offensive was the town of Pavlinovo situated on the Smolensk - Spas- Demensk railway, 10km to the south. The German defense in this sector was based on the Büffel-Stellung position, held by XII Army Corps. That Corps' 260th and 268th Infantry Divisions had both been reduced to just two infantry regiments and held very wide sectors, but the terrain was heavily wooded and dotted with numerous fortified villages. Furthermore, two key German positions at Gnezdilovo and nearby Hill 233.3 had not been identified by Soviet intelligence and so escaped the preparatory bombardment.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. That bombardment began at 0440 hours and continued until 0630, consuming more than 50 percent of Western Front's available ammunition. Shortly after crossing the start line the 56th and 65th Guards ran into heavy resistance from the 499th Regiment of the 268th Infantry. That Division's artillery broke up the assault groups before they could make any progress while a pair of German assault guns picked off advancing T-34s of the supporting 119th Tank Regiment. However, here and there some small detachments found a way through. The 56th managed to carve out a 1km-deep penetration near Kamenka but it was soon evident that 19th Guards Corps had been stopped cold. The 15th Guards Corps made somewhat greater progress against the portion of the 499th Regiment that it faced. By the early afternoon the commander of Western Front, Col. Gen. V. D. Sokolovsky, was already making command changes and committing additional forces. During the rest of the afternoon the 10th Guards Army's infantry gradually outflanked the remaining strongpoints of the 499th Regiment and once night fell the 268th Infantry was authorized to pull back 2-3km to form a new line. Meanwhile a battlegroup of the 2nd Panzer Division, de-training near Yelnya, was ordered to march to support that Division.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. The offensive resumed at 0730 hours on August 8 after a 30-minute artillery preparation. The 65th Guards, now reinforced by the 22nd Guards and the 1st Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, remained stymied in front of Hill 233.3, held by a single German battalion. However the two German divisions were being drained by steady losses. A further effort by the two Guards divisions on August 9 was thrown back by a furious counterattack. The Hill was not finally taken until the evening of August 10 after a massive assault led by the reinforcing 29th Guards Rifle Division supported by the 23rd Tank Brigade. A few hours earlier the 56th Guards had captured the village of Delyagino, causing the German forces to retreat 2km to the south. These gains unhinged the Büffel-Stellung and allowed 10th Guards Army to finally reach the Smolensk - Spas-Demensk railway; the XII Corps was now forced to trade space for time until Sokolovsky's offensive outran its logistical support. Western Front's artillery had already shot off almost all of its available ammunition.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. On August 12 the 10th Guards Army made another major push and liberated Gnezdilovo. Despite German reinforcements by late afternoon XII Corps' front was crumbling and Soviet infantry and tanks were approaching Pavlinovo. Under the circumstances the Corps was ordered to evacuate Spas-Demensk overnight. By August 14 Sokolovsky brought the 21st Army into the 10th Guards Army's sector, allowing the latter to pull back for rest and rebuilding. While out of the line on August 17 Colonel Ruz was replaced in command by Col. Grigorii Ivanovich Panishev. On August 21 the STAVKA authorized a suspension of the offensive. German losses had been heavy, but the 10th Guards Army had also lost 30 percent casualties, although the 65th Guards had suffered the most.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. The Liberation of Yelnya The offensive was renewed on August 28, with the 10th Guards, 21st, 33rd and 68th Armies in the center of the Front making the main attack. The objective was to finally shatter the XII Army Corps and then push mobile groups through the gaps to seize Yelnya. At 0800 hours the Front began a 90-minute artillery preparation across a 25-km wide front southeast of that city. 10th Guards and 21st Armies attacked a German battlegroup around Terenino station, held by one infantry battalion and an engineer unit. German reserves were brought in and the battle see-sawed for about eight hours until the German battlegroup fell apart and began retreating to the Ugra River. In total the two Soviet armies advanced from 6 to 8km. The next day the 10th Guards mopped up the German elements that had failed to make it over the Ugra and began pushing up the rail line toward Yelnaya. Despite intervention by the battlegroup of 2nd Panzer the 10th Guards pushed back the right flank of the 342nd Infantry Division with the 29th Guards Division and the 119th Tank Regiment in the lead. Yelnya was evacuated during the afternoon and was liberated on August 30.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. From here it was only 75km to Smolensk, but by September 3 the German 4th Army had patched up a tenuous new front west of Yelnya. General Sokolovsky continued local attacks through the first week of the month but his Western Front was again forced to a halt due to logistical shortages. He was authorized to pause the offensive for another week. During the night of September 14/15 Sokolovsky's center group of armies conducted aggressive probing all along the front of the German IX Army Corps which was holding a 40km-wide line with five decimated divisions; known German positions were also pounded with artillery. At 0545 hours a 90-minute artillery preparation began, followed by an intense air bombardment. The ground attack began at 0715, south of the Smolensk - Yelnya railroad. At 1030 hours the 10th Guards Army struck the left flank of the 330th Infantry Division with a mass of infantry and tanks, pushing back two battalions. The Army, in cooperation with 21st Army, continued attacking into the afternoon, creating several small penetrations and advancing up to 3km.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. The Liberation of Smolensk Overnight the 330th Infantry made minor withdrawals to straighten its front. On September 16 the 10th Guards Army, now led by 15th Guards Corps, failed to make any substantive gains. However it was clear by the end of the day that IX Corps was close to breaking and during the night it fell back to the next defensive line, which was mostly incomplete. Sokolovsky ordered a pursuit to approach Smolensk from the south with the 10th Guards and 68th Armies and most of his armor. The retreat of the 330th Infantry was covered by the Tiger tanks of heavy Panzer- Abteilung 505. Supply problems forced the Soviet armies to pause for a few days outside Smolensk before making the final push. On the morning of September 22 that push began and 68th Army made a clear breakthrough southeast of the city. Late on the 23rd German 4th Army signalled the evacuation of Smolensk. During the next day the Soviet forces probed the German defenses but did not begin their attacks until nightfall. By 0600 hours on September 25 most of Smolensk was liberated, although much of it was destroyed or damaged.Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Kindle ed. Battles for Orsha By October 2, 10th Guards Army had reached a line from Liady southwards along the Mereia River to the town of Baevo. Early on October 3 the Army launched an assault as part of Western Front's offensive on Orsha; 22nd Guards was in the first echelon of 19th Guards Corps with 65th Guards Rifle Division, prepared to attack across the river between Kiseli and Kovshichi, facing the boundary of 18th and 25th Panzer Grenadier Divisions. Fierce fighting developed for the crossing site at Kiseli, which was not overcome until 30th Guards Rifle Division finally took Liady on October 8 and 15th Guards Rifle Corps was able to commit 85th Guards Rifle Division from reserve to unhinge the river line. At this point the 19th Guards Corps finally crossed the river and joined the pursuit, which led to the eastern approaches to Dubrovno, 15km east of Orsha, by the end of October 11. After a fast regrouping by 10th Guards Army the offensive was resumed the next day with the 22nd Guards leading its Corps on the left flank. Following an 85-minute artillery preparation the division stepped off, but almost immediately stalled due to the ineffectiveness of the artillery and armor. Ongoing assaults up to the 18th produced meager advances at considerable cost.David M. Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 67-68, 71, 73-75 This was followed by another regrouping, which was recorded in the 22nd Guards divisional history:This renewal of the offensive began early on October 21 after a two-hour-and-ten-minute artillery preparation which struck the first defensive line of the German 197th Infantry Division. The divisions of 31st Army in the first echelon punched through, advancing as much as 4km deep, and were reinforced on the right the next day by 65th Guards. However, the advance that day was considerably less, in part due to heavy German artillery fire and an inability to reply due to shell shortages on the Soviet side. While the remainder of 10th Guards Army cleared German defenders from the bogs south of the Verkhita River, this was also at considerable cost, and a halt was called once again at the end of October 26.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 85-87 After replacing 65th Guards on November 5 (above), 22nd Guards continued intense fighting along the Orsha axis through most of the rest of the month.Despite these heroics the depleted Soviet divisions did not break through the German defenses, and finally went over to the defense before month's end. Baltic Campaign On December 8, the STAVKA ordered that the 10th Guards Army be redeployed from Western Front to the 2nd Baltic Front, well to the north. It was intended to spearhead, along with the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, a new offensive northward from the Nevel salient towards Idritsa, beginning on January 10, 1944. In the event, 10th Guards required considerable replenishment of personnel, equipment and supplies and was not ready for that date. 19th and 7th Guards Rifle Corps shared a total of 10,500 personnel replacements during the move, which was finally completed on January 14.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 304, 691 As of July 1, prior to start of the summer campaign, the 22nd Guards was still in 19th Guards Corps of 10th Guards Army in 2nd Baltic Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 148 It was located just north of Novorzhev, facing the German Panther Line defenses. By one month later it had crossed the border into Latvia at Kārsava.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 10, 22 On August 5 Guards Colonel Panishev left command of the division; he was replaced four days later by Col. Vasilii Ivanovich Morozov, who would hold this position until the end of the war. Over the next six weeks the division made steady but unremarkable progress through eastern Latvia, reaching the vicinity of Lubāna by mid-September.

The Grigory Yavlinsky presidential campaign, 2000 was Grigory Yavlinsky's campaign in the 2000 Russian presidential election. Yavlinsky ran as the nominee of Yabloko. This was Yavlinsky's second presidential bid, as he had been a candidate in the previous presidential election. Early developments Before the emergence of Putin, Yavlinsky and Zyuganov been regarded as the only two prospective candidates to be supported by a strong constituency and a national party. However, Yavlinsky's appeal was limited, as his base of support overwhelmingly came from intellectuals and those in the upper middle class. Additionally, his limited experience in government was seen by analysts as a potential hindrance to his prospects, as it was believed that Russian voters wanted to vote for an individual who could \\"get things done\\", rather than someone who simply appealed to them on an ideological basis. In 1998 a limited number of polls showed Yavlinsky as one of the top-two candidates. Polls consistently indicated that Yavlinsky would win in a runoff against Zyuganov. However, polls also consistently indicated that Yavlinsky would lose in a runoff against Yevgeny Primakov. However, by late 1999 Vladimir Putin had arisen as the vast frontrunner and Yavlinsky's fortunes had faded. This reality was cemented when Yabloko underperformed in the 1999 legislative election. Entering his presidential campaign, Yavlinsky's popularity was the lowest it had ever been. His image had been badly damaged during Yabloko's campaign in the 1999 legislative elections. During the autumn of 1999, Yavlinsky had wavered in his stance on the Chechen War and performed very poorly in heavily- watched televised debates. Campaign Yavlinsky blamed Yabloko's poor performance in the preceding 1999 legislative election on a weak campaign strategy and a poor image, believing that he himself was ineffective in reaching voters on his own. Thus, Yavlinsky released control of his presidential campaign strategy to others. Yavlinsky attempted to position himself as the candidate for Russia's democratic movements, and, as a presidential candidate, returned to his steadfast opposition to the handling of the Chechen War However, he nevertheless was struggling to even retain the support of Yabloko's own base of support (which was estimated to comprise roughly 5% of the Russian electorate). With much of the media being loyal to Putin, they provided very unflattering coverage of Yavlinsky. For instance, they publicized press conferences help by a group called \\"gays for Yavlinsky\\" (part of Putin's \\"dirty tricks\\" to decrease the appeal of Yavlinsky, as homosexuality was not widely approved of by the Russian public). The ORT network not only aired reports that drew a connection between the Yavlinsky campaign and the homosexual community (alleging that they were one of the primary groups supporting him), but it also alleged that Jews and foreigners were two other groups that comprised Yavlinsky's primary base of support (hoping to harm Yavlinsky's appeal to voters harboring antisemitic or xenophobic sentiments). In February Yavlinsky reiterated his intent to combat Putin's campaign declaring, Yavlinsky had hired campaign experts who masterminded an attempt to drastically overhaul his image using television advertisements. Yavlinsky's campaign bombarded voters with advertisements in the last two weeks of the election. These ads used slogans such as \\"Reason, Will, Result\\". A number of the ads attempted to show a personal side of Yavlinsky in an attempt to soften his image. Yavlinsky also ran attack ads against Putin, most notably one which questioned his KGB history (the pro- Putin television channel ORT refused to run this ad). While the ads were highly visible, they failed to help improve Yavlinsky's image. Some observers argued that by bombarding voters with advertisements for his candidacy, he created voter fatigue around his candidacy. With his campaign focusing their efforts on its television advertisements, it neglected to allot resources to local campaign organizations, thus depriving the campaign of leafleting, locally distributed materials, and monitoring of polling places. The measured approach which Yavlinsky proposed to resolve Russia's economic ills failed to appeal to a populace that widely desired immediate solutions to its economic crisis. The lack of a strong middle class hampered the appeal of many of Yavlinsky policies. Russia's political polarization hindered the appeal of Yavlinsky's relatively centrist politics. Additionally, many were off put by Yavlinsky's reputation as a half-Jewish intellectual. Independent candidate Yevgeny Savostyanov, who had been polling under 1% and had garnered very little attention, held a press conference in which he announced his withdrawal from the race, throwing his support behind Yavlinsky's candidacy (and urging Konstantin Titov to do the same). In a last-ditch effort during the final days of the campaign, Yavlinsky declared his willingness to establish a vast coalition of liberal movements in cooperation with figures such as Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais. Chubais disregarded this as having come far too late. Outcome and concession After the election, Yavlinsky declared that his campaign had, \\"achieved what we wanted: we have demonstrated that there are millions of people behind us who support what we are talking about.\\" He also declared that he hoped to establish a broader coalition for right-wing opposition to the Putin's administration. Platform and positions In regards to social issues, Yavlinsky occupied the political left. In terms of economic issues, Yavlinksy occupied the far-right of the Russian political spectrum. His politics could be classified as liberal-democratic. Yavlinsky had long been a figure who supported democratic and free market reforms, but opposed the course of actions which Yeltsin's regime had taken to implement reforms. Unlike other major political parties in Russia, Yavlinsky's Yabloko had consistently opposed military actions in Chechnya. This was a position that had often placed the party at odds with prevailing public sentiments. In 2000, Yavlinsky was the only presidential candidate who was opposed to the war. Renown human rights activist Sergei Kovalev endorsed Yavlinsky because of his stance against the war. Commenting on the Second Chechen War Yavlinsky stated, Yavlinsky ran as a free marketer but with measured state control.White, S. (2001). The Russian presidential election, March 2000. Electoral Studies, 20(3). He wanted stronger oversight of public money, an end to the black market and reform of the tax system coinciding with an increase in public services. He also advocated for a strengthened role for the Duma and a reduction in the size of the civil bureaucracy. He was the most pro-Western candidate, but only to an extent: he had been critical of the war in Chechnya but remained skeptical of NATO.

Precambrian  Some international dating work around 1973 indicated that most basement rock in North Korea dates to the Proterozoic or the earlier Archean. The North Kyangsong Province gneiss samples indicated ages to 2.12 billion years ago and in 1985, the Sangni Metamorphic Supergroup and the Sangni Revolution were proposed as names for the gneiss-schist and gneiss formation. These groupings have been used to make sense of the 2.1 billion year old Punchon Granitic Gneiss, the Wonnan Group and the P'yonghae Group. The Machyollong Metamorphic Supergroup is particularly widespread in the northeast, overlying older basement rock near the Yalu River. The supergroup is up to 10 kilometers thick with magnesite-bearing marble, mica schist and quartzite (quartzite units increase in thickness to the west). The western edge of the Machyollong Zone is known as the Iwon Mobile Belt and contains extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks. The late Proterozoic Sangwon Synthem is widespread in the Pyongnam Basin and other, smaller basins in North Korea and experienced deformation during orogenies in the Mesozoic.  Paleozoic  Mount Seorak The Late Ordovician Miru Series was identified beginning in 1971 as the Koksan Series and subsequently renamed after 1975. The 170 meter thick limestone and siltstone centered around the P'yongnam Basin has extensive crinoid, coral and gastropod fossils. Paleogeography researchers have suggested that corals formed in the Miru Sea—a branch of the South Yangtze Sea. The discovery of Ordovician fossils meant that the previous Koksan Series was revised to be younger, encompassing Silurian slate, limestone and siltstone in the Singye- Koksan area up to 280 meters thick. It includes trilobite and Rugosa fossils. For years, geologists in the Korean Peninsula were puzzled about the early Paleozoic fossils found in the early Mesozoic Taedong Synthem (limestone pebbles in the Kyomipo Conglomerate). However, in 1991, Kang and Pak inferred an origin from the Koksan Series. Marine fossils are also widespread in the Imjin Group, first recognized in 1962 in the Kaesong-Kumchon-Cholwon area. The three kilometer thick unit is subdivided into the Anhyop, Puapsan and Saknyong Series and is widespread throughout the Imjinang Fold Belt in central North Korea. The Anhyop Series represents one kilometer of schist, limestone, phyllite and sandstone. The 1.1 kilometer Puapsan Series and one kilometer Saknyong Series are both very similar, although the Saknyong also has siltstone and volcanic rocks. North Korean geologists have identified the Imjin Group as a continental rift basin, correlated with similar rocks on the Shandong Peninsula across the Yellow Sea in China. Many of the rocks have experienced low-grade metamorphism and volcanic sequences are comparatively thick. At the base of the Taedong Synthem is the P'yong'an Supergroup, which lies disconformably atop older Paleozoic rocks. In the Pyongyang Coalfield it is divided into the 650 meter sandstone, shale and conglomerate of the Nogam Formation, the 500 meter Kobangsan Formation, 350 meter coal-bearing Sadong Formation and 250 meter chert-bearing Hongjom Formation, all typically assigned to an Upper Permian shallow marine environment. Mesozoic  During the Mesozoic, the region experienced the Songnim Orogeny, named for overturned, overthrusted Choson and P'yong'an synthem rocks near Songnim, north of Pyongyang. This event is associated with the 240 to 190 million year old Triassic and Jurassic Hyesan Complex pluton. Taebo, a place north of Pyongyang is the namesake of the Taebo orogeny, a period of tectonic activity that emplaced the Taebo Granite around 180 million years ago. The orogeny, which is evidenced in the Okchon Supergroup, is likely related to the separation of Japan from Asia. North of Pyongyang, Precambrian basement rocks are unconformably overlain by a Jurassic limestone conglomerate ascending to layers of siltstone and mudstone. The Upper Jurassic Shinuiju Formation northwest of Shinuiju has sandstone, conglomerate and mudstone up to two kilometers thick. Offshore drilling in the West Korea Bay Basin indicates these rocks are the onshore extension of offshore units. It is subdivided into fluvial rocks and Upper Jurassic black shale, limestone, conglomerate and sandstone formed in a lake environment. Cenozoic  Heaven Lake, a volcanic crater lake at Changbai on the North Korea–China border Earthquake map of Korea 2000–2017 Longstanding terrestrial conditions prevailed through much of the Cenozoic, until the recent geological past, when the a marine regression flooded the area around the peninsula. Very few Cenozoic sediments are known from either Korea, likely as a result of erosion due to uplift of the peninsula. Submarine normal faults along the eastern coastline may have driven crustal tilting. The 350 meter thick Bongsan Coalfield in Hwanghae Province on the west coast preserves and coal-bearing layers dating to the Eocene. Further to the north, in the West Korea Bay Basin Eocene and Oligocene sedimentary rocks up to three kilometers thick unconformably overlie Mesozoic rocks, formed in lakes and coal swamps during the Paleogene.

Two years after her disappearance, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, other missing person non-profits, as well as Marshall's family, received phone calls and letters from an anonymous man claiming to have abducted Marshall. In the letters and phone calls, the man detailed sexual abuse but alleged that Marshall was safe and had traveled the world with him. The identity of the anonymous caller and writer is unknown. Marshall's disappearance has received coverage from the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries, as well as true crime-writer Nancy Grace. Disappearance On June 25, 1983, four-year-old Nyleen Kay Marshall attended a picnic with her family at a campground in the Helena National Forest near Helena, Montana. At approximately 4:00 p.m., Marshall was playing with other children who had walked ahead of her near the beaver dams on Maupin Creek. When they turned around, Marshall was nowhere to be seen. Investigation Search efforts Law enforcement extensively searched the campground and area where Marshall was last seen, but their attempts to locate her were fruitless. A man wearing a jogging suit was allegedly seen in the area this day, and Marshall was seen speaking to him, though it is unknown if he was involved. The Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as various volunteers searched the area, including abandoned mine shafts. Members of the local LDS Church, of which the Marshalls were also members, helped with the search. Phone calls and letters On November 27, 1985, two years after Marshall's disappearance, an anonymous phone call was placed to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System from a man claiming to have abducted Marshall. Two months later, in early 1986, a typewritten letter was sent to law enforcement in Wisconsin from an anonymous man claiming he had picked up \\"a girl named Kay.\\" This letter included details about Marshall's disappearance that had never been released to the public; one detective described him as being \\"privy to things that a normal person would not have access to.\\" The writer of the letter explained that he had a good \\"investment income\\" and worked from home, where he homeschooled Kay. He also claimed to travel frequently with her throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. He claimed that though he knew her family missed her, he loved her and could not return her. The letter was postmarked from Madison, Wisconsin. Around the same time, an anonymous caller claiming to be the writer of the letter placed several phone calls to Child Find of America, a national missing children's non-profit in New York. The phone calls made to Child Find were traced to several phone booths, including one located near a pharmacy in Edgerton, Wisconsin. Law enforcement disclosed that information relayed from the caller and in the letter suggested Marshall was a victim of sexual abuse. Excerpts of the letters that were shown during the case's 1990 airing on Unsolved Mysteries read: Excerpt 1 Excerpt 2 Excerpt 3 Sometime after the receipt of the letters and phone calls, a witness claimed to have seen a girl resembling Marshall at a restaurant in Janesville, Wisconsin. After the receipt of the letters, an unnamed individual claimed to have murdered Marshall and disposed of her body in a mine shaft near Helena. The mine shaft, which had since been sealed, was searched to no result. Discovery of Monica Bonilla Incidentally, after the airing of Marshall's case on Unsolved Mysteries in 1990, a tip received from a viewer who believed Marshall may have been one of his school classmates in Bellingham, Washington led to the recovery of Monica Bonilla, a young girl who had gone missing in 1982 from Burbank, California, having been kidnapped by her non-custodial father. Aftermath By 1994, the Marshall family had relocated from Montana to Japan. The following year, in 1995, Marshall's mother Nancy was murdered in Mexico.

In the 1928-29 Sheffield Shield he scored 743 runs at an average of 74.30; in the whole competition only Don Bradman scored more. A careful player, judiciously selecting which ball to hit, Thompson had great powers of concentration, scoring 275 not out in 628 minutes against New South Wales in 1930-31, the highest individual score at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. A schoolteacher, Thompson’s cricket career was restricted by country postings. He spent three years in the country after World War I and had another country stint from 1933.

A specialist in comic dramatic sketches and light romantic fiction, she also wrote and performed monologues on suffragist issues.From The Publishers' Weekly, September 25, 1915  Life and career  She was born in Richmond, Indiana to Joseph Henry Cooke and Jessie Benton Cooke and attended the University of Chicago, graduating with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1899. She began working as a journalist soon after and by 1902 was touring the United States as a monologist. Several of her monologues and one-act plays were published in booklets and collected form. Her first novel, The Girl Who Lived in the Woods, was published by A. C. McClurg & Co. in 1910 and, like many of her future works, concerned the overcoming of conflicts between an unorthodox romantic couple. Benton Cooke's most well-known work was the novel Bambi. Initially serialized in the American Magazine from April to October 1914 and published in the same year by Doubleday, Page & Co., it is the story of a young woman who impulsively marries an idealistic but impractical writer and becomes a novelist and playwright herself. Its humor and witty dialogue quickly made it a readers' favorite and commercial success, with the first edition selling out two weeks before publication. Bambi was followed by other novels including Cinderella Jane (1917) and The Threshold (1918), which both explore women's work, class, and the relations between the sexes.  Activism  As an active supporter of the feminist politics of her time, Benton Cooke performed suffrage monologues at over a hundred gatherings including the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s 1912 convention in Louisville, Kentucky. She was a member of literary associations like the Little Room Club in Chicago and the Authors League, as well as of women's clubs like the Women's University Club and the feminist debating and activist group Heterodoxy, both located in New York City. She was an editor and contributing writer for Four Lights, the journal of the New York City chapter of the Women's Peace Party. In 1916 she contributed a chapter to The Sturdy Oak, a round-robin novel that narrates the conversion of an anti-suffragist into a suffragist reformer. Other contributors included Dorothy Canfield Fisher and Fannie Hurst, and the book's proceeds went to the suffrage cause.  Death  On April 26, 1920, Benton Cooke's death was announced via cablegram from Manila, where she had arrived a few days previously on a world cruise with her mother. Her novel Married? was published posthumously and was one of at least four of her works adapted into a silent film. Her estate was estimated at $42,358 in 1922 and included $17,100 in film rights.

Biography Monument to Giovan Vincenzo Alberti in Church of Santa Croce, Florence He was born in Florence to Giovanni Antonio Santarelli, who worked as an engraver of cameo jewelry.Enciclopedia Economica Accomodata all'Intelligenza, Volume 2, by Francesco Predari,Turin (1864): page 990. He enrolled in 1814 at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, where he took classes with Francesco Carradori and Stefano Ricci (sculptor). In 1824, he won a stipend to study in Rome with Bertel Thorvaldsen. In Rome, he also met with Augustin Dumont. He was a prolific sketch artist and created many plaster models and studies. In 1831, Santarelli collaborated on the stucco decoration for the ballroom of the Meridiana building of Palazzo Pitti, built by Pasquale Poccianti. He was engaged by Poccianti to also complete stuccoes for the Chapel of the Madonna in the sanctuary of Maria Madre di Dio at San Romano, near San Miniato al Tedesco. In Florence, he completed the bas-relief for the tomb of the Countess of Albany in Santa Croce, Florence; the Countess' statue was completed by Luigi Giovannozzi.Italy: Handbook for Travellers, by K. Baedeker, Koblenz (1870); page 305. Also for pantheon- former church of Santa Croce, Santarelli in 1836 sculpted the monument to Giovan Vincenzo Alberti, former minister to the Grand-Dukes of Tuscany. This statue was commissioned by Giovan Vincenzo's son, Leon Battista Alberti, who also commissioned the monument to his famous ancestor of the same name, which is located across the nave and sculpted by Lorenzo Bartolini.Saunterings in Florence: a new artistic and practical hand-book, by Elvira Grifi, Florence (1899); page 286. He also completed in 1838, a bas-relief for the funerary monument of the painter Francesco Sabatelli. In 1832, he designed the reliefs for the base of the monument to Pietro Leopoldo erected in Pisa. The artist and patron François- Xavier Fabre commissioned from Santarelli an Immaculate Conception for the cathedral of Montpellier. Fabre would designate Santarelli as heir to his collections of drawings from artists from the Renaissance and Baroque eras. This collection is now in possession of the Uffizi Museum. In 1837 Santarelli was able to buy a comfortable house and garden in Via della Chiesa #44 in Oltrarno. He was known for his cultivation of Camellias. In 1840, he completed the statue of Michelangelo for the series of prominent Tuscans displayed in niches on the ground floor courtyard of the Uffizi gallery, commissioned in 1836 by the committee established by Vincenzo Batelli. Among his early free- standing statues were Apocrate (1838), La concezione (1858), Amor puro and Amor terreno.Cenni biografici e relazione delle imprese artistico-commerciali by Angiolo Gatti; Florence (1861); pages XVIII and XXIII. He subsequently also made a number of statues titled Malignant love, Giovinetto cacciatore, Love in ambush, Love with butterfly, Poor Child, \\"Baccante corcata who is joking with a satirino\\", The fallen lily, and Prayer of Innocence. In 1865 he completed the monument of Giuseppe Bezzuoli, located in the church of San Miniato al Monte. Santarelli hired the sculptors Pietro Freccia and his brother, Clearco, to work with him until 1847. In 1866 he donated to the Uffizi his collection of drawings by ancient and contemporary authors.Encyclopedia Treccani, entry on Santarelli.

The terrain is one of flat floodplains on alluvial soil. Due to high water table and frequent flooding, the area has remained relatively forest-free, and is today characterized by extensive wetlands of bogs and grasslands. The area remained ice-free during the Pleistocene glaciation, creating a refuge for many plant and animal species. It has an area of .  Location and description  The northern section stretches about 300 km in a northwest-to-southeast direction on the Russian side of the south-flowing Amur River. it is roughly centered on the city of Blagoveshchensk in Amur Oblast, Russia. This section is mostly surrounded by higher ground in the Manchurian mixed forests ecoregion. Separated by 150 km, the southern section is about 100 km longer, and straddles the Amur as it turns northeast between Heilongjiang province in China, and Khabarovsk Krai in Russia. Most of this section is in China. To the north and east of this section is the Ussuri broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion, and to the south is the Suiphun-Khanka meadows and forest meadows ecoregion. The Amur has meandered and shifted over the long term, leaving flat, alluvial soils that support rich wildlife, as well as competing agriculture.  Climate  The region has a Humid continental climate - cool summer subtype (Koppen classification Dwb). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with long, cold winters and short, cool summers with no averaging over . Mean precipitation is about 604 mm/year. The mean temperature at the center of the ecoregion is in January, and in July.  Flora and fauna  In the wet meadows on the lowest levels and terraces, the dominant plants are reed grasses Calamagrostis. The extensive meadows of the ecoregion support many species of Apiaceae (umbellifers of the Parsley family) that are often tall, flowering herbs, of Spiraea, hardy deciduous-leaved shrubs of the family Rosaceae.

Biography  Jean-Pierre Finant was born on 22 April 1922 in Bondo, Belgian Congo to an Azande mother and a Belgian father. He undertook six years of primary and four years of middle education at the Ecole des Frères Maristes in Buta. After a one year training course at the Ecole Supérieure des Télécommunications in Léopoldville, he found work at the telecommunications service in Stanleyville. He held the post until 1960. He served as president of the Association du personnel des Télécommunications and was a member of the Association du Personnel Indigene de la Colonie (APIC) labour union. He was married and had five children, including future singer Abeti Masikini.  Political career  In 1959 Finant was elected to the council of the Mangobo commune. In October he participated in a nationalist congress in Stanleyville. He later became the vice-president of the Orientale Province branch of the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). In January–February 1960 he attended the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels as a member of the MNC-Lumumba delegation. In March he was appointed to the Executive College for Orientale Province. In the general elections of May 1960 Finant was elected both as a deputy in both the Orientale Provincial Assembly and the national Chamber of Deputies. Though he won the latter seat with 20,854 preferential votes, he was persuaded by MNC leader Patrice Lumumba to forgo it in favor of the provincial position. He was subsequently elected President of Orientale Province on 11 June with 69 votes of the provincial assembly (out of 72 possible votes). After independence the Force Publique mutinied and the country plunged into disorder. During the crisis he became increasingly loyal to the MNC and Lumumba, who was serving as Prime Minister. His fidelity to Lumumba remained strong even after the latter was removed from power. Following a defection of deputies from the MNC and their denunciation of Lumumba, a group of disgruntled soldiers in Stanleyville attempted to overthrow the pro-Lumumba provincial government. On 4 October Finant was placed under house arrest in Stanleyville under Colonel Joseph-Désiré Mobutu's orders. He escaped, but was recaptured seven days later and transferred to Luzumu Prison in the Lower Congo and held alongside other political prisoners. Over the next few days more pro-Lumumba officials fled Léopoldville and took refuge in Stanleyville and the wider attempt to remove the provincial government failed. Finant's Minister of Agriculture, Charles Badjoko, took over the provincial presidency. Finant was later sent to Bakwanga, South Kasai where he was put through a tribunal. He was executed there on 13 February 1961 and buried alongside other executed political prisoners in a mass grave.

It is now owned by a mining operation, the Hunter Valley Operations Joint Venture, which adjoins the site. Though commonly known by the one name today, the inn operated under various names throughout its licensed period; it was also known as the Half Way House due to its location between Singleton and Muswellbrook. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1842, the land on which the former inn now stands was granted to Henry Nowland of Muswellbrook, who built the inn in the same year. Nowland's complex included the inn building, a police lockup for prisoners in transport and a stabling area for coaches. The inn served the coaching business along the former route of the New England Highway. A stables and blacksmith premises at the rear of the inn building were likely built later that decade. Nowland later leased the inn to James Watson, who operated it as the Lady Mary Fitzroy Inn from April 1848. In April 1852, the license passed to Henry Nowland's son, James Nowland, who renamed it the Coach and Horses Inn. It passed through a number of licensees before reverting to James Nowland by 1854, when he renamed it the Star of the North Inn. It was renamed the Traveller's Inn for two periods under another licensee, but had reverted to the Star of the North by April 1861. The license lapsed for a period as coaching trade declined following the opening of the railway, but reopened as a wine bar and shop in the 1870s. It varied between uses thereafter: it was a residence known as Liddell House for some time, was relicensed for a period, delicensed for the last time 1904, and was the local post office from January 1890 until the 1920s. It was a residence for several decades thereafter. The New England Highway was realigned to bypass the inn site during the twentieth century, reducing its potential for commercial use. In 1966, the property was sold to the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, who had nearby development plans which did not eventuate. It was leased to tenants until it was vacated in 1977. It has remained uninhabited since that time and has suffered significantly from vandalism. It was placed under an Interim Conservation Order in 1981 and a Permanent Conservation Order in 1982. Some stabilisation works took place during the 1980s. The area now adjoins a Liddell Coal mine site, with drilling taking place from 2015 up to 95 metres from the inn building. A number of basic repairs were conducted in 2015-16 in accordance with mining approval requirements, including repairs to the termite-damaged front verandah, the rebuilding of the fireplace, the deconstruction and preservation of a chimney for future rebuilding, and the installation of timber framing to support remaining chimneys. It is anticipated that blasting on the adjacent site will continue until approximately 2020-21. Description The surviving complex includes the former inn building, police lock-up and stables. The windows are boarded up and the buildings surrounded by security fencing to prevent access. A Liddell Coal report described the buildings as \\"uninhabitable in their current state, primarily as a result of both vandalism and termite damage over the years\\".

Coccus oleae) is a scale insect in the family Coccidae. It is considered one of the three main phytophagous parasites of the olive tree (Olea europaea), together with the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae) and the olive moth (Prays oleae). Although it is a common parasite which occurs most often in olive trees, it is a polyphagous species, also attacking (but less frequently) citrus trees as well as various ornamental shrubs such as oleanders, pittosporums and euonymus.  History  One of the first scientists who studied the insect in a scientific and modern way was Italian naturalist Giuseppe Maria Giovene. He wrote a publication entitled Descrizione e storia della cocciniglia dell'ulivo (1807) in which he answered Giovanni Presta who had denied the existence of the insect in the Apulian provinces of Bari and Otranto. Giovene showed that the insect was common in the above regions as well, even though it occurred less often. Moreover, Giovene discovered the male of the insect, which at that time wasn't known in Europe. In the Dictionary of Natural History of Paris (1816) () it was written that \\"the male is not known\\" ().necrologio-giovene, pag. 44, nota 3 Life cycle The soft body of the adult female olive scale is concealed under a dark grey or brownish-black covering which grows and hardens over time. Male scales are not present in most regions and breeding is by parthenogenesis. The female is generally immobile and lays up to 2,500 eggs in batches. The eggs are retained under the scale and hatch into nymphs known as \\"crawlers\\". These are mobile, emerging from under the scale and dispersing to other parts of the plant. They moult twice before becoming adult, and all life stages of the insect feed by sucking the sap of the host plant. Distribution and hosts Saissetia oleae may have originated in South Africa but has spread around the world and now has a global distribution. It has been recorded feeding on 113 species of plant in 49 families. As well as being a serious pest of olive, it is one of the most important pests of citrus especially in the Mediterranean area, California, Florida and South America. The parasitic wasp Metaphycus helvolus is native to South Africa and has been introduced to California where it has dramatically reduced incidence of this scale in citrus orchards.

Based on the BMW 4 Series (F32), the B4 and D4 are manufactured in coupé and convertible body styles. The B4 and D4 were launched in 2014 and the more powerful B4 S was launched in 2017.  Development and introduction  Introduced at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, the B4 is based on the outgoing 435i. The N55 straight-6 engine was modified by using twin-turbochargers, a 61 percent larger intercooler and a new crankshaft. The engine also utilised new pistons; all of these modifications allow the engine to generate between 5,550 and 6,250 rpm and between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm. The engine is mated to a ZF 8HP70 \\"Touch tronic\\" paddle shift automatic transmission, with no manual transmission options available. The transmission was modified to provide better shift timing. There were options for either an rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive drivetrain. The car has three driving modes \\"Comfort\\", \\"Sport\\" and \\"Sport +\\", which depend on tweaking of the power delivered by the engine and suspension system settings according to the driving conditions. The suspension system is a carryover from the D3 but has a 40 percent higher work rate. The B4 has adjustable dampers that can be calibrated to provide a softer compression but firmer rebound. The suspension system also has new bushings and anti-rollbars.

A cousin of Owain Glyndŵr, Prince of Wales, he was a friend of Henry IV of England and opposed his cousin's 1400–1415 uprising. Sele was captured by Glyndŵr but is said to have accepted an invitation to hunt with his cousin on the Nannau Estate. Sele attempted to kill Glyndŵr but failed and was himself killed, his body being hidden within the hollow of an oak tree. The oak is subsequently said to have been haunted and was named Derwen Ceubren yr Ellyl (\\"The Hollow Oak of the Devils\\") or Ceubren yr Ellyll (\\"The Hollow Tree of the Ghost\\").  Biography  There are several different versions of the life of Hywel Sele. Hywel Sele was a distant cousin of Owain Glyndŵr (c. 1359 – c. 1415), the last native Prince of Wales. Sele was a friend of the English King Henry IV and due to this was opposed to the Glyndŵr Rising. Sele fought against Glyndŵr and was captured in a battle near Beddau. The abbot of Cymer Abbey brokered a reconciliation between the two men and they later went hunting together in the Nannau Estate. It is said that during the hunt Sele drew his bow to shoot Glyndŵr. However Glyndŵr anticipated this and struck Sele with his sword before he could release the arrow. Fearing repercussions from the abbot, Glyndŵr hid Sele's body in a hollow in an ancient oak tree.\\"Realising the repercussions from the Abbott and the followers of Hywel, Owain concealed the body in the hollow of an ancient oak tree\\" This subsequently became known as Derwen Ceubren yr Ellyl (\\"The Hollow Oak of the Devils\\"). Glyndŵr burnt down Sele's estate, leaving Sele's 2-year-old son to be brought up by an uncle. A cousin of Sele, Gruffydd ap Gwyn of Ardudwy heard of the burning of the estate and set out to rescue his kinsman. But Glyndŵr ambushed Gruffydd's 200-strong force at Llanelltud Bridge and killed sixty men before razing Gruffydd's own estates.  Different accounts  There are significant differences in other accounts of Sele's life. In T. P. Ellis' 19th-century writings the sequence of events is reversed. Glyndŵr is said to have captured Sele and carried him to Llanelltud, where Gruffydd unsuccessfully attempted to release him. After Glyndŵr's victory the abbot attempted his reconciliation, and the fateful hunting expedition was carried out. In Ellis' version Glyndŵr, suspicious of Sele, survived by wearing a coat of mail beneath his clothes. In William Wynne's History of Wales, the attempted killing of Glyndŵr takes place after Glyndŵr asked Sele to prove his skill with a bow and Gruffydd is said to have demolished the bridge at Llanelltud to prevent Glyndŵr's passage; his subsequent defeat taking place at Rhyd Cadwallon (a nearby ford) and in the surrounding countryside. John Humffreys Parry (1786–1825) relates another account in which the meeting came about by accident while Glyndŵr was hunting on Sele's land and a confrontation turned violent. The story is regarded as a legend by Elissa R. Henken, who states that the story was at some point muddled and Sele's name sometime rendered as Huw Selef. She notes that some local people still regard the site of the tree as haunted. The story was also ascribed to legend by D. Helen Allday. Breverton states that there is some uncertainty over the date of the killing with 1402 given most credence, though some sources state 1404 or 1406. The story was well known among the inhabitants of Dolgellau.  Nannau Oak  An engraving made from Hoare's 1813 drawing of the oak The tree that supposedly entombed Sele subsequently became known as the Nannau Oak. Thomas Pennant inspected the oak in 1778 and noted that it was in girth but that it was in an advanced state of decay. The tree was said to have resembled the shape of a gothic arch. The tree fell on 13 July 1813 and it was said that the body of Sele fell from within it and was laid to rest at Cymer Abbey. Sir Richard Colt Hoare was present at the time it fell and had completed a drawing of the tree that very morning. The drawing shows the tree in its decrepit state and damaged by lightning. As with the rest of the story there are different versions of events. T. P. Ellis states that Sele's body lay within the tree only for forty years. He further notes that the oak was also known as Ceubren yr Ellyll (\\"The Hollow Tree of the Ghost\\") and was regarded as haunted, with people afraid to approach it at night. The site of the tree was marked on the day it fell by a sundial and brass plate with a sketch of the tree. The landowner, a baronet, is said to have had the wood of the tree made into various utensils. It is also said that many houses in Dolgellau contained an engraving of the tree with a frame made from its wood. The tree was immortalised by Walter Scott in his 1808 work Marmion as \\"the spirit's Blasted Tree\\".

The suspect was Gregory A. Bush, age 51, a white man, who also exchanged gunfire with a bystander outside the store. After his arrest, Bush was initially charged in state court with two counts of murder and ten counts of wanton endangerment, and held on $5 million bail.Zraick, Karen, and Stevens, Matt. Kroger Shooting Suspect Tried to Enter Black Church Before Killing 2, Police Say, The New York Times, October 25, 2018. Retrieved October 30, 2018. On November 15, 2018, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Kentucky indicted Bush on six counts: three hate crime charges and three firearms offenses. He was revealed to have made many online postings that were racially discriminatory. At a court hearing in July 2019, Bush was found mentally competent to stand trial following a psychiatric evaluation; a trial date has not been set.  Incident  According to Jeffersontown police, Bush had earlier on October 24 tried to enter a service of the First Baptist Church of Jeffersontown, a predominately black church. He was stopped by its locked doors. Police and church leaders said a surveillance video had recorded Bush's attempt.DiGiacomo, Janet. \\"Kroger shooting leaves 2 people dead in Kentucky\\", CNN, October 26, 2018. Retrieved October 30, 2018. Between ten and fifteen minutes later in mid-afternoon, police say Bush entered the Kroger store, where he fatally shot Maurice E. Stallard, aged 69. He went outside and fatally shot Vickie Lee Jones, aged 67, who was in the parking lot. Both victims are African American. Bush also exchanged gunfire with a bystander, who had seen him shoot Jones. Another man said Bush told him, \\"Don't shoot me. I won't shoot you. Whites don't shoot whites\\" before the gunman fled. He was caught and arrested by police, who arrived four minutes after being called.  Perpetrator  Gregory Alan Bush was arrested by Jeffersontown police as the suspect. He is divorced and was living in Jeffersontown. According to the local police chief, Bush had a history of mental illness and domestic violence; in a 2001 incident his ex-wife (who is black) gained an emergency protective order against him; during an altercation he twice used a racial epithet against her. By this order he was barred for three years from having or buying guns. In January 2009, as a result of domestic violence against his parents, with whom Bush was living, the judge ordered him to \\"surrender his guns and undergo mental health treatment.\\" Bush had attacked his father and threatened to kill his parents. In relation to the Kroger shooting, the Louisville police chief described it as a hate crime motivated by Bush's racism.Novelly, Thomas. \\"Police chief calls Kroger shooting in Louisville a hate crime\\", USA Today, from Louisville Courier Journal, October 29, 2018. Retrieved October 30, 2018. The New York Times published a quote from a Facebook page appearing to belong to Bush: “My paranoid-schizophrenia finally stopped me from working and now am on mental disability. I’m lucky I made it this far with all the trouble I’ve caused myself when I get off my medicine.” Tommy Juanso, an attorney and former friend of Bush, had said that his friend's rhetoric had become increasingly vitriolic during the heated 2016 presidential campaign and the political polarization it created. Juanso is biracial and said that Bush mocked him, calling him \\"The Big O\\" (referring to President Barack Obama). In Bush's social media accounts, such as Twitter, he had posted frequently about black-on-black crime and made racial insults.Novelly, Thomas. Kroger shooting: FBI questions Gregory Bush's Twitter friend, Louisville Courier-Journal, November 1, 2018, Retrieved January 11, 2019.  Legal proceedings  Shortly after his arrest, Bush was charged by Kentucky state prosecutors with two counts of murder and ten counts of first- degree wanton endangerment. On October 31, a Jefferson County grand jury indicted Bush on two counts of murder, one count of criminal attempted murder [the gunfight with the bystander who attempted to subdue him] and two counts of wanton endangerment. Bail bond was set at $5 million and Bush was held in Metro Corrections. U.S Attorney Russell Coleman released a statement on October 31, that the US Attorney's Office and the FBI were \\"collecting the evidence necessary\\" to potentially charge Bush with possible violations of federal law, \\"which includes potential civil rights violations such as hate crimes.\\" On November 15, 2018, a grand jury in the Western District of Kentucky indicted Bush for three federal hate crime charges—two counts of shooting or killing a victim based on race or color, and one count of attempting to shoot or kill a victim based on race or color—and three firearms offenses. At a July 2019 preliminary hearing, prosecutors said that a Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center report found Bush competent to stand trial on charges stemming from the shooting. Bush has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder, and wanton endangerment.https://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/local/2019/07/24/louisville-kroger-shooting-suspect- gregory-bush-competent-judge-rules/1802842001/ In November 2019, Bush returned to court and both the prosecutor and defense agreed for him to be sent back to Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center for more mental health treatment.  Aftermath  Shortly after the incident, Kentucky State Representatives James Nemes and Jerry Miller pre-filed a bill to supplement the state's hate-crime law. The bill calls for a person to be charged with a hate crime, in addition to the homicide charge, if the crime was found to be motivated by \\"race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national origin.\\" They added criminal homicide and fetal homicide as crimes to be covered as hate crimes. Many politicians cautioned that law enforcement investigations needed to be completed before the shootings could be classified as a hate crime. The Kroger shooting followed a mass shooting at a synagogue in Squirrel Hill, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Referring to both crimes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement saying, \\"If these aren't definitions of hate crimes, I don't know what a hate crime is.\\" He called for Bush to receive the death penalty if convicted of the charges. Many activist groups, such as Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and Showing Up for Racial Justice, met with local politicians to urge that Bush be charged with a hate crime. They expressed concern that he might escape justice by using mental illness as a defense. As one member told officials, \\"Mental illness does not prompt you to wake up wanting to kill black people. Mental illness does not discriminate as this man did.\\" According to CNN, the event was one of three hate-motivated events that took place in the United States the same week, along with a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and a series of mail bombing attempts.Sanchez, Ray, and Gray, Melissa. \\"72 hours in America: Three hate-filled crimes.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. It is the last remaining Victorian-era farmhouse located within the limits of the City of Rochester. History Milo Prentice Newberry was born in 1825, in Oneida County, New York, the son of Romeo and Sarah Beckwith Newberry. The Newberry family moved to Oakland County in 1835. Milo Newberry attended school in Rochester, and in 1849 married Mary Jane Hoyt. The couple first lived near where Romeo and Milo Newberry had constructed a sawmill, but in 1857 Milo sold the property land purchased a ten-acre parcel where this house now stands. He constructed another sawmill and began operating it. In 1859, he left for a year as part of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Newberry returned from the gold rush with enough money to open a cabinet shop. Newberry also had enough money to finance the construction of a new house, which he began about 1863. In 1867, he purchased an additional 80 acres, and began transitioning away from his sawmill and into farming. The Newberrys eventually owned 149 acres of land. Milo and Mary Jane Newberry raised five children in the house. However, Mary Jane died in 1876, and Milo Newberry married his second wife, Eliza Baldwin, in 1877. Milo and Eliza had another two children. Milo Newberry lived in this house until his death in 1909. At this time, Milo's granddaughter, Mabell Howell Frank, and her husband Lucius \\"Bert\\" Frank, purchased the property, but Newberry's wife Eliza, continued to occupy the house until her death in 1919. Bert and Mabell Frank then moved into the Milo Newberry house, and some time in the 1920s enclosed the porch and made some additions to the rear of the structure. They lived in the house and farmed the property until their deaths in 1969 and 1970. At this time, all but five acres of the farmland were sold. The Franks' granddaughter, Bette M. Frank Reddish and her husband, Michael Reddish, purchased the house in 1974, and as of 2018, Bette Frank Reddish continues to live in the Newberry house. Description The Milo Prentice Newberry House is a mid-19th century Victorian farmhouse containing Italianate details. It is an unusual Y-shape design with 3 gable wings, a design of which there are no other known local examples. The design was likely one of Newberry's own creation. The walls are constructed of 2\\" solid oak and black walnut planks covered with horsehair plaster on the interior. The house is clad with cedar siding on exterior. Some of the windows still contain the original hand blown glass.

Bonnell, along with Natalie Wynn, were credited by YouTuber Caleb Cain for his turn away from the alt-right. The New York Times has also identified Bonnell's political content, and particularly his combative debating style, as a force that has successfully worked against the far-right radicalization which some people experience through watching online videos. Bonnell describes himself as a rule utilitarian and a social democrat. Throughout Bonnell's early career, he was well known for his provocative persona and common use of crass language. This led to temporary suspensions from the Twitch platform for insensitive language. In September of 2020, Twitch provided notice to Bonnell that his partnership agreement would be terminated in October 2020. Twitch did not provide a specific reason for the termination. A debate between Bonnell and well-known YouTuber JonTron on the latter's racial views became popular and controversial.  Personal life  Bonnell lives in Los Angeles.

The castle has been rebuilt many times over the centuries. Fortifications have existed since Hélie de Villebois, 1st Lord of Cognac built a fort around 950. Around the year 1000, Itier and Arnaud de Villebois settled on the site of Cognac and founded their dynasty there. This construction is known to us by a charter of 1030 and documents concerning the church of Saint Léger and the convent buildings which are adjacent to it, built from 1031 by the Benedictines. A small town was formed around the fort and priory. Around 1200, the castle was rebuilt in stone, on the Charente River bank facing the docks and walls built to circle the town. Cognac passed by marriage of Amélie de Cognac to Philippe de Falcombridge, the illegitimate son of King Richard I of England. Philippe sold the lordship of to John, King of England. In 1202, John, King of England, entrusted the castle and its dependencies to Renaud II de Pons, Pons de Mirebeau and Robert de Torneham, then seneschal of Poitou. This was territory that rightfully belonged to the Count of Angoulême but had been controlled by his suzerain, the Count of Poiou since the 1180s. After the death of King John in October 1216, Hubert de Burgh, seneschal of Poitou, had Cognac seized, sparking a war with Renaud II. Cognac was to be a source of friction for many years. King John's widow, Isabella, heiress of Anoulême, reasserted her rights over Cognac and enfeoffed her new husband, Hugh X of Lusignan. Renaud continued to wage war to keep his control of Cognac and its dependencies. De Lusignan took the castle of Cognac despite threats, including that of excommunication by Pope Honorius III. The Lusignan's undertook extensions to the castle in the 13th century. Between 1366 and 1370, the castle of Cognac was, together with the castle of Angoulême, were the main residences of Edward, Prince of Aquitaine and Wales, the son of King Edward III of England. King Philip IV of France linked the lordship of Cognac to the crown of France, however during the Hundred Years' War, the castle changed hands during sieges and treaties. Upon the release from captivity in England of John, Count of Angoulême, after 33 years, John finds the castle abandoned and in a ruinous condition. Reconstruction began on the castle in 1450. His son Charles, Count of Angoulême and Louise of Savoy made Cognac an intellectual and artistic centre. Their son King Francis I of France built the long facade of the castle facing the banks during 1517. Due to a lack of maintenance, the castle became ruinous during the late 17th century and 18th century. The owner Charles, Count d'Artois sold some buildings to finance repairs. The castle was sold as national property for demolition, but in 1795 was by traders in Messrs Otard and Dupuy, to install cellars. During the 19th century, renovations caused the destruction of sections of the castle, however important restoration work of conservation and restoration, was also undertaken.

He was to inherit a large fortune from his maternal grandfather provided he changed his family name to \\"Smith\\", to which he agreed before reverting again. Wolfe became posthumously famous when he died on the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2 in controversial circumstances. Family background Dudley Wolfe was born in New York on February 6, 1896 to Dudley Wolfe and Mabel Florence Wolfe (née Smith). His father had immigrated from England in 1888 and was a coffee importer. Claiming to have an aristocratic background, Wolfe senior mixed in New York high society telling entirely fictitious stories of his life tiger hunting in India and so forth. His mother was the daughter of the immensely wealthy Benjamin Franklin Smith, who together with his three brothers had made their money in gold and silver mining in Colorado in the mid 1800s. They wisely sold at the height of the boom to move into real estate and railroads. When they returned to Maine in the 1880s they were thought to be worth $20 to $30 million (roughly $ to $ million in ). Benjamin's three brothers had no children so he was able to pass down the entire estate. Wolfe's parents had married on October 15, 1892 and within a year his father's business was bankrupt. Despite these circumstances, the family lived a wealthy lifestyle thanks to a steady flow of cash from his mother's family. The couple had four children, three sons and a daughter – Dudley was the middle son. They had lavish educations at a series of boarding schools but none of the boys did well academically at school. Dudley was, however, good at sports – football, hockey, running, boating and hunting. Wolfe senior died in May 1908, and Mabel remarried a Nebraska businessman, Joseph Baldridge, and moved to Omaha. Eventually Wolfe's academic progress was so poor that he was not allowed to continue at Phillips Academy even though the headmaster recognized his \\"faithful, conscientious effort\\" and the goodwill he had engendered at the school. Wartime In 1916, unable to find a satisfactory job, Wolfe tried to join the WWI war effort by applying to join several branches of the U.S. military but he was rejected because of poor eyesight and flat feet. He then put himself on the year-long waiting list for the French Foreign Legion, while in the meantime joining the Red Cross ambulance corps. In 1917 he sailed for Europe. In Liverpool by complete chance he met Lucien Wolf who, for the first time, told him of his father's true background. Lucien Wolf's brother, Dudley Wolf (before he changed his name to Wolfe), had been the son of a Bohemian Jew who escaped antisemitic uprisings in 1848 to become a tobacconist in London. Wolfe's grandmother, Céline Redlich, had came from Vienna. It is not clear whether the Smith side of his family ever knew about Dudley Wolf(e)'s true background. Wolfe volunteered to work at various war fronts driving an ambulance, a slightly converted Model T Ford, under appalling conditions taking wounded soldiers back from the front to the field hospitals. Later joining the Italian Ambulance Service he was awarded the Italian Croce di Guerra and a campaign medal on the Italian front. After ten months' ambulance service, in October 1918 he was called up into the Foreign Legion but only served for a month up to the armistice – he was awarded the French Volunteer Medal and Campaign Medal. Phillips Academy now acclaimed him as having won more medals than any other alumnus. Inheritance Wolfe stayed in Europe for a year before returning to Omaha to take part in running the family real estate business. This was not to his liking so every summer he went to Maine for yacht racing. In 1924 he left Omaha for good and that year he and his brothers were summoned to the vast Maine estate of their 94-year-old grandfather Smith. Grandfather Benjamin Smith's fortune was by then worth $70 to $100 million (roughly $ million to $ billion in ) – reputedly he was the richest man in New England. By strong family tradition his fortune would normally have been inherited by Mabel's brother but he had died long ago after leaving one son, Clifford. Smith so strongly disapproved of Clifford that he announced that his heirs would be his three grandsons from Mabel. The proviso was that the three boys were required to change their family name to Smith and they agreed to do this legally. However, after a while Dudley felt the change of name had been disloyal to his father so he went to his grandfather to say he would change back and decline the inheritance. The elder Smith was impressed with this principled stance and agreed to leave the share of his fortune to him anyway; Grandfather Smith died in 1927. Sporting youth Wolfe was gentle, cheerful and rather shy. He was very stockily built, strong and very determined. Although he was extremely wealthy he was not ostentatiously so in his manner although he had refined tastes. He owned a large estate on the coast of Maine, likened by his nephew to something from The Great Gatsby, with Rolls–Royces, large power boats and sailing yachts. In 1925 he was accepted by Harvard University despite not having the required academic qualifications – he eventually graduated in 1930. He joined the elite unofficial \\"Dicey\\" chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon and the \\"Owl Club\\", easily meeting the requirements of social status and wealth. Despite being ten years older than his colleagues he was popular and respected for his experiences of the war and his yachting successes. Wolfe raced in a range of international and local yachting competitions. He raced his new yacht to win the Brooklyn Yacht Club's deep-sea Challenge Cup in 1925. In 1929 he commissioned a sixty- foot schooner, calling it Mohawk, and entered the transatlantic \\"King and Queen's Cup Classic\\" although no one previously had raced a sixty-foot yacht across the ocean. Captaining the vessel he came in second despite competing against yachts of one hundred feet and over. He also commissioned a racing cutter Highland Light in which he took part in the 1931 Fastnet Race. Wolfe moved to live in Europe where he participated in climbing and skiing in the Alps, appointing guides to help him. He became an accomplished skier – he achieved a ski traverse across the Mont Blanc massif – but he struggled to master the technicalities of climbing. Marriage In 1934 at St Anton in the Austrian Alps, he noticed and asked to be introduced to Alice Blaine Damrosch. Damrosch was the eldest daughter (born May 18, 1892) of Walter Damrosch, the American conductor. She had married Hall Pleasants Pennington in 1914 but deserted him early in the morning on the first day after their wedding. She went on to have many romances but she and her husband remained friends and only divorced in the late 1920s when she moved from the United States to Austria. She spent her life socializing, skiing and hunting, and was the first woman to ski down the ice wall of Tuckerman's Ravine. The couple married in October 1934 and maintained homes in New York, Maine and Austria. By 1938, although still in love with his wife, Wolfe decided he wanted to be a single man again so he asked Damrosch for divorce. She was devastated but they continued living together even after the divorce became final. K2 expedition In early 1938 Wolfe and his wife held a party in their Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan to show friends photographic slides of their climbing and skiing activities in Europe. Fritz Wiessner, the famous German- American mountain climber, had been invited and he was on the lookout for wealthy mountaineers who might be willing to join in, and pay for, an expedition he was organising to attempt to climb the second-highest mountain in the world, the K2. At the time, none of the 14 mountains over 8000 metres had been climbed. When Wiessner broached the subject with him Wolfe was immediately hooked, despite his inexperience in climbing high mountains. On December 10, 1938, Wolfe sailed on the Georgic to stay with Alice for Christmas in Austria before leaving for India. Their divorce had become final in November but she had invited him to be with her all the same. In early spring he tried and failed to reach the summits of Mont Blanc and Piz Palu, even with a guide. In March 1939 he met Wiessner in England where they bought climbing equipment to complement the sports clothes he had purchased in New York. The whole team boarded the SS Conte Biancamano in Genoa on March 29, 1939, to sail to Bombay with Wolfe paying to upgrade all the tickets to first class. Throughout the expedition Wolfe and Alice wrote each other loving letters. At Srinigar at the start of the expedition proper Wolfe was dismayed to find out that Wiesner had not taken his advice to bring two-way radios. On the march-in to K2 base camp Wolfe coped as well as anyone else and started off strongly when it came to climbing the mountain. However, above Camp II he was noticeably slow and was criticised for this by some of his colleagues. Wiessner favoured him over the other team members because he was less complaining and had good endurance. He did not take any sort of lead, however, and merely plodded up to each camp after it had been established by other climbers. In this way he got further up the mountain than any of the Americans except Wiessner. No one had bottled oxygen and by Camp VIII at on July 14 Wolfe could get no higher so he waited there for seven days while Wiessner and Pasang Dawa Lama made their failed summit bid. Then, descending with the others to Camp VII at he waited another seven days under appalling conditions while his two companions went down further to get help. As they reached each camp they found nobody there and any equipment had been removed so they went on and on down until they arrived at base camp. As one of three attempts at rescue, on July 29 three Sherpas managed to climb up to Wolfe and might conceivably have rescued him except that he was by then in a terrible mental state and refused to go down asking them to return the next day. After that the Sherpas themselves also died on the mountain. In the months and years to come there were strong recriminations over whether Wiessner had abandoned Wolfe or had done his best to rescue him; why the expedition had been an organisational failure; why Wolfe had been allowed to climb so high (and why he had been allowed on the expedition at all); and whether the Sherpas should have been allowed to try and rescue him. Wolfe's brother Clifford Warren Smith considered taking legal action but in the end he decided to drop the case. In 2002 skeletal remains were found on the Godwin-Austen Glacier at the foot of K2. Close by were ancient bits of mountaineering equipment and a leather mitten marked \\"Wolfe\\". An ancient dinner plate from amongst the debris was inscribed with Wolfe's name to make a plaque for the nearby Gilkey Memorial which at that time had the names of 52 other climbers who had died on K2.

The detention camp was reserved to about prisoners from the Austro-Hungarian army, mainly of Czech–Slovak, Polish, German, and Hungarian nationalities; Romanians, who were gathered in the Romanian Legion of Italy by the end of the conflict, had a garrison and a training camp in Avezzano. Mostly abandoned in 1920, a sector was reused in World War II to house Indian, English, New Zealand, and Pakistani war prisoners..  World War I  India ink drawing reproducing the camp with a bird's eye perspective (author unknown, 1920) Romanian legionaries visiting the \\"Fucino Incile\\" (Fucine Inlet - July 1918) A few months before the Kingdom of Italy's official entry into World War I, the disastrous 1915 earthquake almost completely destroyed the city of Avezzano, razing to the ground a lot of centers in Marsica and the nearby provinces as well. Because of the earthquake, the city recorded a population loss of about 90%. Despite everything, the few young men who had survived and belonged to the age classes of the last years of the nineteenth century were not exempted from military service and were called to the recruitment in the army at war and to the mobilization towards the Karst Plateau. In a short time, the youth who had survived the earthquake had to abandon the devastated areas, leaving a real generation void. In order to support the reconstruction of the city, in the second half of 1916 the Salandra government decided to install Central Italy's largest concentration camp for Austro-Hungarian war prisoners. Capable to house about 15,000 internees and 1,000 Royal Italian Army officers and soldiers in charge of guard, the camp also had a larger extension than Abruzzo internment camps and Servigliano imprisonment camp. Officially coded as PG091, the camp was located in an area north of the city, in a piece of land of about , where 192 masonry and wooden pavilions were erected for prisoners' shelter and logistical services. Besides the military engineering warehouse-office, built near the Cimarosa Cottage (Villino Cimarosa), several urbanization and logistics works were carried out in the camp: the military command-house, the small hospital, the sutler's shop, the stores, the guard building, the internal road system, the water plant connected to the Tre Conche reservoirs through pipes, the almost sewing network, the power network system..  Prisoners' works  The Villino Cimarosa (\\"Cimarosa Cottage\\"), formerly the military engineering office headquarters The Tre Conche (\\"Three Reservoirs\\") The prisoners of Avezzano concentration camp were engaged, in observance of the international directives established by the Geneva Convention, in a number of works such as removal of the rubble from the 1915 earthquake, co-operation to the reconstruction of the new city through the building of roads and public buildings, agricultural works in the Fucino fields left uncultivated, reclamation of rivers and streams, planting of the pinewood with the primary purpose of protecting the area from the frosty winds coming in winter from Mount Velino, afforestation of Mount Salviano and Mount Tino in Celano and extraordinary repairs to the municipal cemetery.. There were also requests for help by the mountain municipalities of Marsica and the province on the occasion of natural disasters, such as the heavy winter snowfalls.  The cemetery  Monument to the former cemetery in Chiusa Resta The cemetery was erected in a distant position from the prison in the location of Chiusa Resta, an area already used for cemeterial services since 1656, the year of the Great Plague. The burial place was closed in 1881 owing to the necessity to build, along the road to Luco dei Marsi near the Church of St Mary in Vico, a municipal cemetery which was safer from the health point of view and more suitable for the city's new needs, during a period of demographic and social growth. While deceased officers were buried next to the St Mary in Vico cemetery, the Chiusa Resta graveyard was set up again to accommodate the corpses of the 850 Bohemian, Czech–Slovak, Croatian, Polish, Serbian, German, Hungarian internees and Romanians from Banat, Bukovina and Transilvania who had died between 1917 and 1919.. Almost all corpses, about 770, were exhumed between 1969 and 1991 in order to be moved to the Asiago War Memorial. The dismantlement of the cemetery officially occurred beginning in 1991.. In 2007, following the further building expansion of this area, it was arranged for the last remains to be exhumed and returned to foreign authorities.  Abolition of the camp  At the end of the war, prisoners had to wait several months before returning home, because of the territorial disputes among the new states born in Central and Eastern Europe. On 23 September 1920, Deputy Camillo Corradini obtained the free transfer of several buildings, including the Cimarosa Cottage, in favour of the Avezzano municipality.. Some huts and pavilions were also transferred to Italian State Civil Engineering and Italian State Railways, while most of the occupied land was returned to its owners..  World War II  During World War II, a sector of the concentration camp was reopened to confine prisoners from the Allied forces who opposed the Axis powers. Put under the control of the Royal Italian Army and later of German units, the camp housed Indian, English, New Zealand, and Pakistani war prisoners. During the war, German General Albert Kesselring had his headquarters, with more than 200 officers and about 1,000 soldiers, established near Albe Castle.. The city of Avezzano, having become a transit place at the service of Nazi troops, suffered heavy bombing from the Allies, which caused several civil victims and damages to 70% of the architectural heritage restored a few years after the 1915 earthquake.. During the feverish bombing period a lot of prisoners escaped from the camp, managing to find shelter in Marsica mountain villages or in the most inaccessible areas of the Abruzzi Apennines.  Dismantlement of the camp  The definitive dismantlement of the camp occurred in the years after World War II: most huts were demolished or replaced with modern buildings, including the one used as a church. Few ruins and the foundations of some masonry pavilions are still visible inside the pinewood.. The remains of the electricity substation of Roveto Electrical company lie between Don Minzoni and Fosse Ardeatine streets, in the modern Borgo Pineta district. The Tre Conche reservoirs, restored several times, are located inside the pinewood, while the Cimarosa Cottage is placed sideways to the Church of Madonna del Passo..

It was opened for this purpose on 1 June 1897, with the Thalwil–Zug section owned by the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) and the Zug–Arth-Goldau section owned by the GB. Since the nationalisation of the GB in 1909, the entire route has belonged to the Swiss Federal Railways (Schweizerische Bundesbahnen, SBB). The route is still partially single-track and therefore highly-subject to delays. In addition there is a danger of natural hazards, especially on the Zug–Arth-Goldau section, which as a result often has to be closed for several days.  Route The line begins in Thalwil, where it branches off from the Lake Zürich left bank line (Linksufrige Zürichseebahn). The double-track section has run steadily uphill to Horgen Oberdorf since the 1960s. After that, it passes under the Horgenberg through the 1985 metre-long, single-track Zimmerberg Tunnel. After the tunnel, the line crossed the Sihl on two tracks—with each on its own bridge—and reaches Sihlbrugg station, to which the Sihltal Railway was extended from Sihlwald and opened on the same day as the Thalwil–Arth-Goldau line. This is followed by the 3,359 metre-long, single- track Albis Tunnel and then the Litti operations yard, from where the line has run as a double track to Baar since 1979. It is crossed by the A4a motorway. The Lorze is crossed before Baar; the old, 96 metre-long bridge was replaced during the duplication of the line with a new 110 metre-long structure. A stress test was carried out on the newly built bridge with eight Ae 4/7 locomotives during the night from 28 to 29 March 1981. There have been two tracks between Baar and Zug since 1931. The line was connected to the existing Zug station of the Zürich–Zug–Lucerne Railway (Zürich-Zug-Luzern-Bahn), which was operated by the NOB, requiring the station to be rebuilt. This created connections to the Zürich–Zug railway and the Zug–Lucerne railway. The Zug–Arth-Goldau line is still completely single-track, which severely limits the operation of the Zug Stadtbahn and the Gotthard express trains. In addition, it runs through geologically unstable terrain, which makes doubling of the track almost impossible. In addition, the route is endangered by possible landslides and debris flows during every major storm. Immediately after Zug station, the 255 metre-long viaduct follows Gotthardstrasse (Gotthard road), Baarerstrasse (Baar road) and Poststrasse (Post road) and the 585 metre-long Stadt (town) Tunnel. The halt of Zug Oberwil was upgraded to a station in 2010 to provide a second crossing point on the line. The line passes through the 36 metre-long Lotenbach Tunnel and the 90 metre-long Bühl Tunnel before Walchwil. For a long time, Walchwil station was the only place where trains could cross. As a rule, the regional trains (now line S2 of the Zug Stadtbahn) crossed with the oncoming Gotthard expresses. This is followed by the 48 metre-long Rossplatten Tunnel, the 94 metre-long St. Adrian Bridge, the 65 metre-long St. Adrian Tunnel, the 70 metre-long Rufibach Bridge and the 40 metre-long Rufibach Tunnel. Later, the 69 metre-long Kalkofen Tunnel and, shortly before Arth-Goldau, the 192 metre-long Mühlefluh Tunnel follow. Double track to Arth-Goldau station begins at the subsequent Goldau Mühlefluh operations yard. In Arth-Goldau station there is a connection to the Gotthard line of the SBB and the Pfäffikon SZ–Arth-Goldau railway of the SOB, as well as interchange with the Arth-Rigi Railway (Arth-Rigi-Bahn).  Development In order to be able to achieve a half-hourly journey for express trains on the route from Zurich to Ticino, a second track has been under construction near Walchwil since the end of 2016. During the two-year construction period, the line between Zug-Oberwil and Arth-Goldau has been completely closed. Regional traffic has been served by buses during this period, while long-distance trains are diverted via the western side of Lake Zug.

It provides 13,752 seats in the stands (with room for up to 17,178 spectators) in the main arena and is considered one of the largest entertainment and sports halls in the country. Initially, the venue was given the name \\"Podium Hall\\", which was later changed to \\"Hala Gliwice\\". Since opening in May 2018, this name is used interchangeably with the name \\"Arena Gliwice\\" which is used for international events. Construction The construction of the hall began in 2013 following the demolition of the former stadium. Initially, the city was counting on financial support from the European Union, but after the refusal, it was decided to finance the construction from the city's budget. The originally planned construction cost was to amount to PLN 321 million, and the construction was to be completed in mid-2015. According to the report on the implementation of the Gliwice city budget for 2017, the total outlays for the implementation of the investment in 2017-2018 amounted to PLN 420.4 million,https://bip.gliwice.eu/pub/html/um/files/BA/roczne_sprawozdania/2017/sprawozdanie_2017.pdf 31% above the originally assumed amount. Gliwice Arena has a two-level car park, the upper level of which can be adapted to organize events and outdoor exhibitions. The car park has 800 spaces. The facility is adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. There are 72 places available for them (36 places for wheelchair users and 36 for accompanying persons) located in all sectors and locations that guarantee good visibility. The main arena adjoined by a training hall and fitness building. The highest climbing wall in Europe and stage suspension system were also installed in the building. Events The first event that took place in the arena was a women's run as part of the cross-country event \\"Bieg Kobiet Zawsze Pier(w)si\\". During the event, which took place on 6 May 2018, a group of women ran through the main part of the hall. This race was part of an event organized for the fight against breast cancer. The official open days were organized on 12 and 13 May 2018, and on 30 May 2018, the concert of Armin van Buuren took place. On 6 March 2019, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska (TVP) announced that the arena would host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019. It took place on 24 November 2019, and marked the first time that Poland had hosted the event. Poland won the contest on homesoil with Viki Gabor and the song \\"Superhero\\". It was the second time that Poland won the contest and were the first country to win back-to-back.

His father Jean (John) Reynaud was for some years a Lecturer in French at Avondale College from which Daniel Reynaud obtained his teaching degree in History and English in 1979. He taught secondary History and English at Longburn Adventist College, Auckland Adventist High School and Rosmini College between 1980-1991.  Tertiary career  In 1992, Reynaud began lecturing at Avondale College of Higher Education in the field of media and English. In 2003, he shifted his teaching focus primarily to history. He was a founding Associate Professor of Avondale College when the rank was introduced in 2009, in the same year winning an Australian Learning & Teaching Council Citation for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning, particularly for his innovative use of tabletop wargaming to teach the World Wars at university level. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 2010, and of the Faculty of Arts & Theology in 2011, a position he retained until 2013. In 2017, he was Visiting Professor at Southern Adventist University in Chattanooga, Tennessee in the United States.  Film and Television Historical Research  Reynaud’s interest in film was sparked by his film director brother Gabe Reynaud (1953-2000), who made a series of influential documentary series for Adventist Media, including Keepers of the Flame, Chasing Utopia and The Search. Daniel Reynaud’s doctoral thesis from the University of Newcastle in 1997 was titled Celluloid Anzacs: representations of the Great War in Australian Cinema and Television Dramas. It was later published as Celluloid Anzacs: The Great War through Australian Cinema (Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2007). It explored over 40 representations of World War One in Australian film and television productions. In the course of his research, Reynaud rediscovered several lost or partially lost Australian silent films on World War I. The most significant of these films was The Hero of the Dardanelles (1915), Australia’s first Gallipoli Campaign movie. The film was made during the campaign and was a huge commercial and critical success. Reynaud’s research uncovered lost footage, movie stills and the original screenplay, and he oversaw a reconstruction of the film which was released by the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) in 2015, the centenary of its original release. It is the second-oldest commercially available Australian silent film. Other films unearthed during Reynaud's research include a British compilation film, For the Honour of Australia, which worked together two Australian films about the Sydney-Emden battle of December 1914, For Australia (1915) and How We Beat the Emden (1915). The film, now available at the NFSA, preserves footage of the wrecked SMS Emden after the Battle of Cocos, filmed for a feature documentary in 1915. The last film was the 1928 production The Exploits of the Emden, which Reynaud re-edited together after it had been split into two films. Reynaud has published extensively on Anzac cinema, showing how the representation of the Great War has shifted over time to reflect national interests and concerns, helping to buttress popular perceptions of the Anzac legacy. Representations have changed over time, particularly in showing the ideal Australian soldier, who has transformed from a well-to-do city boy in many World War I movies to a larrikin but good- hearted boy from the bush in films from the 1930s onwards. Similarly, the representation of the British in Australian war films has shifted from the idealized man of the World War I years to the antithesis of the noble bushman Anzac, a shift that began in the 1970s.  Anzacs and religion  Reynaud’s second principal area of research is challenging the myth of the universal secularity of the Anzacs. Two major monographs to date reveal that religion was an important factor in the lives of a large minority of soldiers. The Man the Anzacs Revered (Signs Publishing, 2015) is a biography of legendary Anzac chaplain William ‘Fighting Mac’ McKenzie, arguably the most popular soldier of the Australian Imperial Force and yet largely unknown today. Reynaud's other work, Anzac Spirituality (Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2018) explores soldierly attitudes to a range of formal and informal religious and spiritual issues, drawn from the reading of the diaries and letters of about a thousand Anzacs. The book has been described as ‘a genuinely world-ranking book’, while his work in the area of Anzac religion has been labelled ‘an exceptional gift to Australia and to our understanding of our history.’ Reynaud has also written and appeared in eight documentaries about the Anzacs and religion. One, //Faith of the Anzacs//, screened on Channel 7 on Anzac Day 2010, setting new records for audience response for Adventist Media Network, and winning American and Australian media awards. Another, on Fighting Mac McKenzie, also rated well.  Other work  Reynaud has been involved in various other research projects, including on online learning and Romanian poetry translation. He has also recorded three albums of original music.  Select bibliography   Books  * Reynaud, Daniel. Media Values: Christian perspectives on the mass media.

Charles-Amable Battaille (30 September 1822 – 2 May 1872) was a French operatic bass. Appreciated both for his voice and his acting skills, he premiered the main bass roles for the works represented at the Opéra-Comique between 1848 and 1857, and is especially notable as the first singer of the role of Peter the Great in Meyerbeer's L'Étoile du nord (1854).

They had at least one child, a son, Francis Demetrius Kalopothakes (b. 1867). Kalopothakes became so proficient in the Greek language that she was able to correct the proof-sheets of the Star of the East, a weekly paper published by her husband who was the founder of the Greek Protestant church. She translated books from the English and wrote articles for the Child's Paper, published also in Greek, and aided him in his correspondence with friends in England and the U.S. Though naturally somewhat timid, her gentleness of disposition, and unwearied devotion to the work upon which she had entered, drew the people to her, and her influence was widely felt among the Greek women. But her excessive labors affected her health so seriously that it became necessary for her to return with her husband and children to the U.S. for a brief respite. In August. 1871, she sailed again for her missionary field, but died in Athens, December 16, 1871, after a few months of labor.

It was designed by Thomas Rowe and built from 1874 to 1875. It is also known as Ashton and its grounds and Caprera (c.1875-c.1910); Brema or Braemar (c.1910-c.1920); The German Consulate. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 November 2003.  History  Elizabeth Bay had been the site of a fishing village established by Governor Macquarie in for a composite group of Cadigal people under the leadership of Bungaree (d.1830). Elizabeth Bay had been named in honour of Elizabeth Macquarie. Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor 1821-5, designated Elizabeth Bay as the site of an asylum for the insane. Governor Darling granted Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay in 1826. From 1826-1926 the subject land was part of Macleay's estate, in which he built his mansion in the 1830s to the west. Built well before the house, the estate was widely considered at the time (1820s on) as \\"the finest house and garden in the colony\\". Its wood walks bordered the estate on its eastern sideCarlin, 2000, p.38,92 (and later the site of Ashton).  Description  Ashton comprises a two-storey, late Victorian Italianate harbour side villa in its original grounds. The property addresses Elizabeth Bay, Elizabeth Bay Road and The Esplanade. It features a prominent tower visible from both Elizabeth Bay Road and Beare Park and is known as a local landmark. The house has been extended and renovated a number of times but still retains many of its original Victorian features and details. Many of these additions are significant in themselves due to their association with particular historic occupants of the place. The original section of the house is of rendered brick with struck courses built on a basement podium of sandstone ashlar. Later additions are of rendered brick with struck courses well matched to the original building. Roofs are generally slate. Basement floor is a recent concrete slab with upper floors of timber. The masonry tower features a distinctive, steep pitched roof with cast iron cresting. Joinery throughout appears to be cedar with very recent modifications of undetermined timber. An associated 1920s building on the site, Esplanade Cottage, was demolished without authorisation some time after 1999. Its footings and remnant walls and landscape remain in situ. This building addressed The Esplanade. The grounds contain nineteenth-century sandstone walling and garden terracing, with views across Beare Park to Sydney Harbour. The front garden and carriage loop facing Elizabeth Bay has been modified but retains some original plantings, including curly palm (Howea belmoreana), Lord Howe Island palm (H. fosteriana).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2/2016  Condition  As at 17 December 2003, the house is currently in poor condition due to extensive roof damage in the 1999 hail storms and subsequent neglect. The upper floor ceilings are generally lost but representative ground floor ceilings remain. Most joinery is intact insitu or labelled and stored on site. Most chimney pieces remain insitu. The fabric retains evidence of earlier uses, services and finishes. Recent unauthorised works and demolitions do not preclude a high quality conservation of the place. An associated building on the site, Esplanade Cottage, was demolished without authorisation some time after 1999. Its footings and remnant walls and landscape remain in situ. Many of the early twentieth century additions to the Rowe's original build of the house are generally related to significant occupants and so contribute to the overall significance of the item. A lack of maintenance in the second half of the twentieth century and unauthorised works post 1999 have left the fabric in poor condition but structurally sound. Sufficient original fabric, site and documentary evidence survives to facilitate conservation and interpretation of the place.  Modifications and dates  The following periods correspond to the different names given to the house by its different owners as revealed by documentary research. ;Caprera Period (CP) 1871-1902 This represents the original house built and lived in by Thomas Rowe after he moved from Tresco before 1875. A photograph dated 1885 shows that no additions had been built to the northern or southern sides of the house, apart from a narrow awning at basement level on the south and a small gabled porch at ground floor level on the north. The outline of the house including these minor structures is shown on the 1908 survey along with stables on the western boundary. This plan indicates that immediately to the north of the front door there may have been a verandah or porch. Caprera was described in 1891 as \\"three storey\\" indicating that the current basement level was inhabited. It seems likely that the basement level housed the kitchen and servants quarters. ;Braemar Period (BP) 1903-1921 After Thomas Rowe's death in 1899 the property was rented to various tenants including G. H. Boner. Later it was purchased by Boner, who applied to carry out building works in 1908. It is possible this work included the single storey extension to the south west corner of the house and the two storey extension to the north of the front door and tower. F. A. Lohmann purchased the property in 1909 and it became known as Braemar during this period of German influence. ;Ashton Phase 1 (AP1) 1921-1929 After being confiscated from German ownership at the end of World War I the house was purchased and occupied by Charles Henry Hoskins, proprietor of the Hoskins Iron and Steel Company. Hoskins introduced the name Ashton for the place. He added to the northern end of the house, built two motor garages and a separate cottage to replace the stables and probably built the bay window addition to the library and balcony over. The cast iron detailing of the rear first floor balcony was replaced in timber probably at this time. The ground floor room behind the garage may have been the chauffeur quarters or might have accommodated the kitchen relocated from the basement to a more convenient location. ;Ashton Phase 2 (AP2) 1929-1936 Following the death of Charles Hoskins, Ashton was sold to Leslie Scandrett who added the first floor bathroom to the main bedroom at the south west corner of the house. The Water Board survey from 1934 shows that the large arcaded verandah on the garden front had been added by this time. ;Ashton Phase 3 (AP3) 1937-2002 Very little was added to the house in this period, although the cottage on the western boundary had been extended by 1954 and the land was subdivided into two lots, although retained under a single ownership. The cottage was demolished and the house has suffered storm damage and deterioration due to lack of maintenance. The surrounding development changed considerably in the last period. The enclave of six similar sized villas designed by Thomas Rowe were reduced to three (Ashton, Tresco and Kincoppal) and multi-story flat buildings have been constructed on either side of Ashton.  Heritage listing  As at 1 October 2003, Ashton represents a rare and intact example of a Victorian Italianate villa in its original grounds situated on the Sydney Harbour waterfront, dating from 1875. Designed by the architect Thomas Rowe as his family home, the house and grounds are a fine example of the major domestic work of this prominent 19th Century architect. Ashton is rare in the State as one of the small group of surviving major domestic works attributed to Thomas Rowe, together with Tresco, Kincoppal, and Heathcote Hall. The building retains its distinctive exterior and interior features and the grounds retain important landscape elements, which contribute to the surrounding landscape and relate the property with the other surviving villas of Thomas Rowe. The visual link between the house and Elizabeth Bay that dictated its original siting survives. The house and grounds are a prominent landmark in the locality, visible from Elizabeth Bay, Elizabeth Point, Elizabeth Bay Road, the Esplanade, and other waterfront properties. The house and grounds demonstrate the evolution of the culture, taste, lifestyle and affluence of Sydney's professional and mercantile elite over the period of 1875-1942. Eminent former owners include Thomas Rowe, John Grafton Ross, Charles Henry Hoskins and Sir Cecil Harold Hoskins, who were important figures in the development of Australian architecture and industry, including CSR (Ross), Australasian Gaslight Company (Ross), Australian General Insurance (Ross), Hoskins Iron and Steel Co. (Charles Hoskins), and BHP (Cecil Hoskins). The grandeur, quality, style and situation of the house and grounds provide evidence of the affluence and importance of these figures in Australian architecture and industry. Historically, the property represents one of only two, surviving, intact first-generation subdivisions of the original Macleay Estate, illustrating the first-generation residential development of Elizabeth Point. Ashton was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Ashton demonstrates the first-generation subdivision patterns and residential development at Elizabeth Point. It represents one of only two intact, surviving, first generation subdivisions of the original Macleay family Estate, which was subdivided by the Macleay family from the 1840s. Its original allotment boundaries are still legible and under one ownership, despite subdivision into two lots. The house and grounds provide evidence of the development of Australian architecture during the 19th Century, as a fine example of a Victorian Italianate villa on Sydney Harbour designed by the prominent architect of this era, Thomas Rowe. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Ashton is significant for its association with eminent former owners including Thomas Rowe, Joseph Ross, and the Hoskins family who were major steel manufacturers and associated with the development of BHP. The grandeur, quality, style and situation of the house and grounds demonstrates the professional and economic standing of these figures achieved by the time of their residency in Ashton and their importance in the development of Australian architecture or industry. Designed by the architect Thomas Rowe as his family home (after Tresco), the house and grounds of Ashton also provide evidence of the architectural accomplishments, personal tastes, lifestyle, and economic and social position of this prominent 19th Century architect during the 1870s. Rowe's architectural practice became one of the largest and most important architectural practices of the nineteenth century, with work in Bathurst, Orange, Goulburn, Newcastle and Brisbane as well as Sydney. He became well- known for his commercial buildings, arcades, churches and large private residences. Rowe was a founder of the Institute of Architects in 1871, and served as its president in 1876-1889 and 1895-1897. He was an alderman on the Sydney City Council in 1872-1876 and the first mayor of Manly in 1877. He was also a first lieutenant in the Engineer Corps in 1872 and lieut-colonel in 1886, hence the name \\"Colonel\\". He lost his fortune in the 1893 depression and died almost penniless in his house, \\"Mona\\" in Darling Point in January 1899. The first known following resident of Ashton was Joseph Grafton Ross, company director and son-in-law of newspaper proprietor, John Fairfax. He was chairman and director of various companies, including CSR, Australasian Gaslight Company, Mercantile Bank of Sydney, Australian General Assurance Co, helped establish the Prince Alfred Hospital, and served on many committees for charitable organisations. Oskar Plate was a wealthy and prominent member of Sydney's German born community at the beginning of WWI. As the Sydney-based agent for the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steamship Company, Mr Plate fell into a small category of men targeted by the government for internment and eventual deportation as a means of ensuring that \\"enemy firms\\" which had been ordered closed by the Commonwealth could not reopen once the war had ended. He was interned during the war after a campaign by the tabloid media of the time and was deported in 1919. Ashton was subsequently impounded by the state Ashton was later owned by the prominent steel manufacturer, Charles Henry Hoskins and his family between 1920 and 1929, including his son Cecil Harold Hoskins (later Sir). G and C Hoskins Ltd (later, Hoskins Iron and Steel Co Ltd, then Australian Iron and Steel Ltd) supplied and laid the pipes for the Sydney water supply and later shared the contract to supply to 350 miles of pipe for the Perth to Coolgardie water supply. In 1907 the company took over the Lithgow Ironworks and became a major competitor of BHP. The company built an integrated steelworks at Port Kembla, near Wollongong, in 1928 it merged with Baldwins of England, and in 1935 became a subsidiary of BHP with Cecil Hoskins remaining the General Manager of AIS, and later, director until 1959. Charles Hoskins was an avid car enthusiast, which explains the addition of two motor garages at Ashton in 1921 and 1923. Charles Hoskins died at Ashton in February 1926 and his widow, Emily, continued to live at Ashton until her death in 1928. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Constructed in 1875, Ashton is a fine example of a Victorian Italianate harbourside villa in its original setting. Such villas, once common around Sydney Harbour, are now rare. The villa has survived relatively intact with a number of additions and is structurally sound, although currently in a poor state of repair from hail damage in 1999 and subsequent neglect. Ashton represents a rare example of Thomas Rowe's major domestic work, forming one of the small group of surviving major domestic works attributed to Thomas Rowe, including Tresco (the earlier home of Rowe), Kincoppal and Heathcote Hall. It demonstrates the careful control by Rowe of the overall character of the streetscape and vistas to, and from, the buildings. It is a prominent landmark in the locality, visible from Elizabeth Bay, Elizabeth Point, Elizabeth Bay Road, the Esplanade, and other waterfront properties. Ashton has aesthetic significance for the picturesque massing and exterior decoration of elements such as the tower with its steep slate roof and cast iron cresting. It features some unusual and distinctive interior features such as the staircase and moulded cedar architraves and retains its original iron palisade fence and gate piers onto Elizabeth Bay Road. Ashton retains its large garden with lawn terrace, sandstone walling and steps facing Beare Park and the harbour. Later additions to the building, such as those built by Charles Hoskins, contribute to the aesthetic and historic significance of the item. Ashton and its grounds make an important contribution to the surviving historical landscape and character of Beare Park and Elizabeth Point. The sandstone walling and terracing at Ashton is likely to be the work of Italian stonemasons employed by Thomas Rowe for his own garden at Tresco and for the other villas he designed and built at Elizabeth Point in the 1860s and 1870s. In this, the surviving garden stonework forms a significant group with other sandstone remnants surviving in the grounds of Tresco and Kincoppal, the other villas designed by Thomas Rowe at Elizabeth Point. The property retains its views into and out from the house, which are significant as the house was intentionally sited to take advantage of the outlook across Elizabeth Bay. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Ashton is likely to retain meaning for previous residents including members of the Rowe and Hoskins families, and other families who lived in the house. Ashton is a well-known landmark in the community, contributing to the community sense of place. Regard for Ashton has been indicated by the number of concerned submissions from the community and elected representatives regarding the conservation, disrepair and sale of the property. Community memory of the occupation of the house by German merchants during the 1920s appears to persist in the apparently mistaken belief amongst many locals that the place was once the German Consulate. This local folklore may indicate a high level of community interest in the place. Community esteem is also indicated by its inclusion in the South Sydney Council LEP as a heritage item. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Ashton lies within the grounds of the former Macleay Estate, although it appears to be located outside of the documented extent of Alexander Macleay's landscaped gardens. Maps of the Macleay Estate do not indicate the presence of any early paths or structures in the area around Elizabeth Point. With the upheaval of the site for the building of the house and the garden terracing, it is unlikely that evidence of either Aboriginal occupation or early European occupation survive on the site. Identified archaeological potential on the site dates from the era of the present house and grounds, including the foundations of the 1920s Esplanade Cottage that was formerly located on the lower terrace. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Ashton is rare on the Sydney Harbour waterfront as a surviving example of a Victorian Italianate maritime villa in its original setting. The property is rare in Elizabeth Bay as one of two intact surviving first generation subdivisions of the original Macleay Estate. It is rare in the State as one of the small group of surviving major domestic works attributed to Thomas Rowe, together with Tresco (1869), Kincoppal (c.1869) and Heathcote Hall (1887). The fabric of the house retains some rare evidence of domestic taste and household management as it was not subject to major extension or refurbishment after 1942. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Ashton and its setting is representative of the evolution of the culture, taste, lifestyle and affluence of Sydney's professional and mercantile elite over the period 1875-1942. The house and grounds represent a fine example of a late nineteenth century waterfront mansion designed in the Victorian Italianate style, and represent the first generation residential subdivision and development of Elizabeth Point.

History   Colonial settlement  Elizabeth Bay had been the site of a fishing village established by Governor Macquarie (1810–21) in c.1815 for a composite group of Cadigal people - the indigenous inhabitants of the area surrounding Sydney Harbour - under the leadership of Bungaree (d.1830). Elizabeth Bay had been named in honour of Mrs Macquarie. Bungaree's group continued their nomadic life around the harbour foreshores. Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor 1821-5, designated Elizabeth Bay as site of an asylum for the insane. A pen sketch by Edward Mason from 1822-3 shows a series of bark huts for the natives in the locality.Carlin, 2000, 38 Governor Darling granted Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay in 1826. Macleay's estate was developed well before the mansion (built in the 1830s to the south- west). The estate was widely considered at the time (1820s on) as \\"the finest house and garden in the colony\\". Its shrubbery below (north and north-east of the house) was where Edgerley was subdivided off and developed. After Alexander's bankruptcy his son George subdivided and sold leaseholds between 1841-82. Billyard Avenue was formed to access some of the earliest allotments. The house now known as Ramona at 18 Billyard Avenue, Elizabeth Bay was previously named Haughly (prior to 1926) and Edgerley (1926 until about 1990). It stands upon land identified as Lot 1, Deposited Plan 75455. The property consists of earthen terraces which descend from a high point on Billyard Ave to an area of reclaimed foreshore land granted by the Crown in 1909. Lot 1 was formerly identified as the majority of lot 38 and part of lot 37 of the third subdivision of the Elizabeth Bay Estate put up for 99-year leasehold at auction in July 1882. *1882Subdivision of part of the Macleay Estate. *1885 Construction of house known as Haughly by David Peter Dickson. *1887Construction of seawall and foreshore reclamation *1893-96The Hon.

The property consists of earthen terraces which descend from a high point on Billyard Ave to an area of reclaimed foreshore land granted by the Crown in 1909. Lot 1 was formerly identified as the majority of lot 38 and part of lot 37 of the third subdivision of the Elizabeth Bay Estate put up for 99 year leasehold at auction in July 1882. Ramona is possibly the last remaining single-family dwelling in this portion of Billyard Avenue. It is a grand house with particularly fine harbour views. The original setting has, to a large extent, been compromised by subsequent higher density development comprising apartment blocks and converted grand houses. The existing landscaping in the forecourt area was introduced in relatively recent times.  Heritage listing  As at 24 April 2009, Edgerley is a significant example of a large, late Victorian residence. The interior contains fine examples of cedar joinery including a staircase, fireplace surrounds as well as leadlight windows. The gardens are significant for the rare example of mature palms and ferns. Edgerley is also significant through its association with eminent poet, Kenneth Slessor, who lived there for a period in the 1930s.

Although he never won a Group 1 race and was overshadowed by contemporaries such as Frankel and Dream Ahead he was a top- class performer over distances from six furlongs to one mile and was rated among the twenty best racehorses in the world at his peak. As a juvenile in 2010 he won the Coventry Stakes and was placed in both the Phoenix Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. In the following year he took the Jersey Stakes, Lennox Stakes and Challenge Stakes as well as being narrowly beaten in the Prix Jean Prat. He failed to win as a four-year-old and made no impact when sent to race in the United States. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in India. Background Strong Suit is a chestnut horse with a large white star bred by the Arkansas-based McDowell Farm in partnership with Gainsborough Farm and Robert N Clay. As a foal he was offered for sale at Keeneland in November 2008 and was bought for $27,000 by the bloodstock agent Margaret O'Toole. He was shipped to Europe and in August 2009 he was put up for auction at Goffs and was sold for £40,000 to Peter Doyle Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of Julie Wood and was sent into training with Richard Hannon Sr. at East Everleigh in Wiltshire. Strong Suit was ridden in all but one of his European starts by Richard Hughes. His sire, Rahy (1985-2011), sired the winners of over three hundred races, including more than thirty at Group One/Grade I level. Apart from Strong Suit, his best progeny included Noverre, Serena's Song and Fantastic Light. Strong Suit's dam Helwa never contested a race but was a granddaughter of Private Colors, a full-sister to Personal Ensign. Racing career 2010: two-year-old season Strong Suit made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 14 May and started the 6/4 favourite in a twelve-runner field. He recovered from being hampered when the front-running Straight Line veered to the left, took the lead a furlong out and won \\"going away\\" by one and three quarter lengths from Neebras. A month later the colt was stepped up sharply in class to contest the Group 2 Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot and started the 15/8 favourite in a thirteen- runner field. After being repeatedly denied a clear run in the last quarter mile he produced a strong late run, caught the leader Elzaam in the last stride and won by a nose. Hughes commented \\"He's a bit raw and goofy. When I pulled him out to go around one after a couple of furlongs, he cocked his jaw and ran into the back of the other horse. It was like hitting a stationary car. How he got back up to win after that I don't know\\". On 8 August, Strong Suit was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh and was made the 4/9 favourite against six opponents. He took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and was beaten half a length and a short head by Zoffany and Glor Na Mara. On his final start of the season the colt contested the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 October. Racing on soft ground he proved no match for the easy winner Dream Ahead but came home second of the eight runners. In the official end of the year classification, Strong Suit was give a rating of 113, making him the 17th best juvenile colt in Europe. 2011: three-year-old season On 16 April Strong Suit started second favourite for the Greenham Stakes (a major trial for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury but made no impact and came home last of the six runners behind Frankel. He then underwent an operation to correct a breathing problem. After an absence of two months the colt returned to the track in the Jersey Stakes over seven furlongs at Royal Ascot a race in which he carried a five-pound weight penalty for his Coventry Stakes win a year previously. He started at odds of 11/1 in a nine-runner field which included New Deerfield (King Charles II Stakes), Splash Point (UAE 2000 Guineas), Havane Smoker (runner-up in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Oracle (third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas) and the previously undefeated Western Aristocrat. After racing second place Strong Suit took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by half a length from New Deerfield. Strong Suit was sent to France for the Prix Jean Prat over 1600 metres at Chantilly on 3 July. In a slowly-run race he made the running but was overtaken in the straight and although he rallied to briefly regain the advantage in the last 100 metres he was beaten a head and a nose by Mutual Trust and Zoffany in a three-way photo-finish. Later that month he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Lennox Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 5/2 field in a nine-runner field which included Delegator (Duke of York Stakes), Red Jazz (Challenge Stakes), Libranno (Richmond Stakes). After tracking the leaders he went to the front a furlong out and accelerated away in the closing stages to win \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from Red Jazz. His assistant trainer Richard Hannon Jr. said \\"He might be a horse for the Sussex Stakes next year. I think he will get a mile in time but there are so many nice races like this for him to mop up\\". Following the race he was acquired privately by Qatar Racing. Strong Suit was off the racecourse for well over two months before returning in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on 8 October. In a field of eight he started 13/8 favourite, just ahead of the filly Chachamaidee (Oak Tree Stakes) with the best-fancied of the others being Maqaasid another filly who had finished third in that year's 1000 Guineas. After tracking the pacemaking Across The Rhine he went to the front approaching the final furlong and quickly went clear of the field to win by four and a half lengths from Chachamaidee. For his final run of the season Strong Suit was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 5 November. He started second favourite behind Goldikova but was never able to challenge the leaders and came home tenth of the thirteen runners. In the 2011 World Thoroughbred Rankings Strong Suit was given a rating of 123, making him the 17th best racehorse in the world and the fifth-best three-year-old colt. 2012: four-year-old season On his first run of 2012 Strong Suit ran in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June but a third win at the meeting never looked likely to materialise and he finished tenth of the eleven runners behind Frankel. A return to six furlongs in the following month brought no better results as he came home eighth behind Mayson in the July Cup at Newmarket. At Newbury in August the colt was ridden by Ryan Moore produced his best effort of the season in the Hungerford Stakes as he produced a strong late run but failed narrowly to overhaul the 25/1 outsider Lethal Force. In the Haydock Sprint Cup on 8 September he started the 11/2 third choice in the betting but after leading for most of the way he tired badly in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Society Rock. In the Park Stakes a week later he started favourite but came home fourth behind Libranno after never threatening to win. At the end of the year he was transferred to the stable of Simon Callaghan in the United States. On his only run for his new trainer he finished towards the rear of the field in the Grade II Arcadia Stakes at Santa Anita Park in February 2013.

Controversies   Allegations of inciting persecution against teachers  In October 2018 she created a WhatsApp channel for students to, according to her, “film or record any party-political or ideological expressions that humiliate or offend [their] freedom of faith and conscience” made by school teachers, adding to fears in the international press of widespread ideological persecution in Brazil following the election of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. On 29 October, the Brazilian Public Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation into alleged harassment of state teachers by Campagnolo.  Statement against journalists  After being questioned by the press about allegedly using money provided to her by the State Assembly to attend the launches of her own book, Campagnolo called journalists \\"scoundrels\\". She also questioned whether they \\"have cognitive problems\\". These remarks were followed by a significant backlash from the journalist community. It prompted journalists' organizations to file charges against her on the State Assembly Ethics Board.  Old tweets  In 2019, old tweets from 2012 (when Campagnolo was at the age of 21) resurfaced. Back then she published a series of posts about being under the influence of marijuana and in favor of the drug. She also tweeted about being an \\"adulterer\\" and an \\"alcoholic\\" as well as being a prescription drug user. In another tweet, she implied using pages of the Bible as a rolling paper for drug use. After the tweets gained widespread attention on social media, Campagnolo deleted her account. She later dismissed claims that she was a cannabis user describing her past tweets as \\"irony\\". She explained that she was in nursing school at the time and that joking about psychoactive substances was common among her colleagues.

Similar tales also existed for Dunvegan Castle (see Dunvegan Cup), and at Raasay. Other folktales exist involving Luran. Archaeology Numerous types of vessel (usually pottery) are found associated with British tumulus burials, including items that were either cremation containers, or assumed to be containers for food offerings for the afterlife, or simply treasures or personal effects. Of these some have been identified as 'drinking cups', usual associated with non-cremated interments. Roughly similar cups have been found in Northern Germany, Denmark, and Holland. The form of these cups differs from those found in Roman or Anglo-Saxon burials in Britain. The pottery is hand made, not made on a wheel, and is usually well decorated. The usual form in Britain is a well decorated 'beaker' shape, though cups with handles are also known from the Yorkshire Wolds, and elsewhere. considered that the generally detailed decoration made them impracticable for general daily use, and that they were made specifically for burial with the dead. Non pottery cups include one made of shale, found near Honiton., an amber cup from near Hove (the Hove amber cup), and the Rillaton gold cup. Other 'Fairy Cup' variants also gives the story of The Rillaton Gold Cup as being of this type, though the tale is different being of an inexhaustable cup offered by a druid. This tale is associated with Rillaton Barrow. The Trowie \\"Pig\\", from Scotland, also tells of an inexhautable jug. There is a Scottish folktale from the 17th century of a man who sees a whirlwind in a field and hears voices saying \\"Horse and Hattock\\" - he repeats the phrase and is swept up by the wind and wakes up the next day in the King of France's cellar with a silver cup in his hand. A fairy origin legend has also been given to the glass known as the Luck of Edenhall, a 14th C. drinking glass originating in the middle east. In the legend, which may have been invented in the 18th C., the cup was obtained when fairies were interrupted drinking at a well at Eden Hall (Edenhall), and left the glass behind.

It was founded by a group of dissenters who broke away from the Indonesian National Party (PNI) because of their dissatisfaction with the PNI's increasingly left-wing stance. Its chairman was Wongsonegoro, governor of Central Java. The party aimed to be based on neither religion like the Masjumi or a western political outlook (like the PNI). Initially known as the PNI-Merdeka (PNI-Independent) it subsequently changed its name to the Great Indonesia Unity Party. In 1954, following an internal dispute about whether the party should continue to serve in the cabinet, it split into two factions. In the 1955 Indonesian legislative election, the faction led by Wongsonegoro won 0.5 percent of the vote, while the faction led by Hazairin won 0.3 percent.

When her father was exiled from his church in 1682, the family moved to London£ and engaged in trade. They sold laces from Devon and yarn from Antwerp, and the entire family was engaged in the family business, also her sisters Jane Hoare and Rachel Pinney. Hester Pinney was particularly noted for her business skill and her ability to successful negotiations with their business associates, and therefore entrusted by her family to handle such affairs and, eventually, with more and more of the family business. She imported sugar from the West Indies through an associate, started a lace-making school and lent money for interest as a banker. Her contribution to the family business made the entire family wealthy. After the death of her father in 1705, she also successfully engaged in speculation, and her business became more independent. She is noted to have been a significant member of the London business world. It was unusual for an unmarried woman of her time period to achieve such a position. Pinney never married, which would have placed her under the legal guardianship of her husband, but she had a long-term relationship with her business lawyer, George Booth, without being married to him.

He is one of the leading academics within the study of early Twelver Shiʿism.Sajjad H. Rizvi, review of Review of The Spirituality of Shiʿi Islam, by Mohammad Amir-Moezzi, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 75, no. 2 (2012): 379.  Early Shi'i Views   Imamate  One of Amir-Moezzi's fundamental arguments is that the supra-natural and supra- rational beliefs about the Twelve Imams were the core of Twelver Shiʿism. This puts him in conflict with the prevailing interpretation that it was the rational tradition, lead by figures such as al-Shaykh al-Mufid, that constituted this core.Rizvi, Review, 379; Robert Gleave, “Recent Research into the History of Early Shi’ism,” History Compass 7, no. 6 (November 1, 2009): 1598. This argument was initially put forward in Le guide divin dans le Shiisme original (The Divine Guide in Early Shi‘ism), and continued to be developed in his later work. This view is generally contrasted with the views of Hossein Modarressi. Amir-Moezzi describes this early Shiʿi view as such: > Without the Imam, the universe would crumble, since he is the Proof, the > Manifestation, and the Organ of God, and he is the Means by which human > beings can attain, if not knowledge of God, at least what is knowable in > God. Without the Perfect Man, without a Sacred Guide, there is no access to > the divine, and the world could only be engulfed in darkness. The Imam is > the Threshold through which God and the creatures communicate. He is thus a > cosmic necessity, the key and the center of the universal economy of the > sacred: \\"The earth cannot be devoid of an imam; without him, it could not > last an hour.\\"Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi, The Divine Guide in Early Shi’ism > (New York: State University of New York Press, 1994), 125. ʿAql as Hiero-Intelligence not Rationality  In order to offer a new understanding of early Shiʿi viewpoints, Amir-Moezzi's begins by reconstructing the concept of rationality. The standard understanding considers Imami thought as being a rational theology similar to the Muʿtazila. Amir-Moezzi argues that this assumption distorts the understanding of the early Shiʿi narrations, especially the narrations on ʿaql, which is often translated as reason. The narrations state that the ʿaql is the means through which the doctrine of the Imams is understood. However, ʿaql was equated with rationality later on due to the influence of Greek philosophy, but in the early sources ʿaql was rather what he labels as \\"hiero-intelligence.\\" This \\"hiero-intelligence\\" has four dimensions: cosmogonic, ethical-epistemological, spiritual, and soteriological. The cosmogonic dimension is that the ʿaql proceeded \\"from the God's Light, was the first of God's creations; it is characterized by its submission and its will to be near God.\\"Amir-Moezzi, The Divine Guide, 8. The epistemological dimension is that the ʿaql \\"is not just an acquired quality, but a gift from God.\\" The spiritual dimension is that ʿaql is the \\"inner proof\\" and while the Imams are the \\"exterior proof.\\"Amir- Moezzi, The Divine Guide, 9. The soteriological dimenstion means that \\"the absence of ʿaql, the 'organ' of religion, there can only be false religiousness, an appearance of piety, hypocrisy.\\"Amir-Moezzi, The Divine Guide, 10.

It was built of coquina during the Second Spanish Period in Florida (1565-1763). Today it is a reconstructed building, standing on original foundations which were unearthed during archaeological excavations.  Architecture  The current Oliveros House was the fourth structure to occupy the site at 59 St. George Street. The first building at the site was a wooden house, the second a tabby structure, and the third, again, a wooden house. It was a two-story house with a ground floor consisting of three rooms and a loggia area. The original flooring was apparently wooden. Archaeologists have found partial remains of a coquina and brick fireplace in the north room. The loggia contained a stairway to the second floor and bedrooms.  Early Occupants  An early Spanish map indicates that a Pedro González, native of Galicia, owned the original dwelling. González was married to Isabel Rodríguez of St. Augustine in 1733. They had five children together. In 1763, when Great Britain occupied Florida, most Spanish residents left for Havana. This house was not sold during British occupation, as evidenced by a British map that shows this property as a lot and house in the trusteeship of Jesse Fish, who was a prominent agent for the sale of Spanish property. In 1783, one of the five González children, Juan, married Juana Montes de Oca in Havana. She was also a native of St. Augustine and later would return to Florida as a widow with five children to make a claim for and henceforth live in her father-in- law's house. The Spanish government officially returned the property to widow Juana Montes de Oca in 1784. 1788 records showed that the house was \\"of wood and shingles, covered with palm leaves in fair condition, the property of Juana Montes de Oca.\\" De Oca died in 1791 and the house disappeared from records until 1798. That same year, de Oca's daughter Maria González Montes de Oca sold the lot to Sebastian de Oliveros.  The Oliveros Family  Oliveros was a sailor and native of Corsica who came to St. Augustine in 1733. According to documents of October 4, 1798, he \\"bought from the González Montes de Oca family their lot where he built a home for his family which consisted of a two-story coquina house.\\" Oliveros married Catalina Usina, a local Minorcan girl, and rebuilt the house using coquina. Oliveros frequently sailed to Charleston and northern ports within the United States. He was a victim of piracy in 1804 and was lost at sea. Eleven years after her husband's death, Usina petitioned the Spanish Crown for permission to sell the property. She moved out of the house and rented it to a Gaspar Arnau, a mariner and ship owner, who eventually purchased the property. He operated a shop and a way station in the home. Records described it as, \\"a continuous salon on the ground floor and another upstairs without furring.\\" The yard had a masonry wall. To the rear was a kitchen and the well. The Oliveros House existed until 1908.  San Agustín Antiguo  Oliveros House plaque With generous funding from L.C. Ringhaver, the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board and St. Augustine Restoration, Inc. restored this site in 1964 as part of its living history museum village, San Agustín Antiguo. During this time the Oliveros House was used to display Hispanic cigar-making practices.  Present Day  Today at this site is the retail store Flagler's Legacy, the official spirit shop operated by and for Flagler College. Flagler's Legacy opened for business in the Oliveros House in Spring 2000. Flagler's Legacy seeks to market the College globally and is operated by College students and alumni. All profits from Flagler's Legacy are put into Flagler College general fund. The building is owned by St. Augustine Restoration, Inc.

Prior to his dismissal in late 2018, he worked as a legal advisor to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and a media consultant, close advisor, and friend to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. His official post was General Supervisor of the Center for Studies and Media Affairs. Described as a \\"nationalist ideologue\\", al-Qahtani served as a major influence over Mohammed bin Salman's foreign and domestic policies. He reportedly oversaw the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, among other interrogations and torture. It was after this event that he was dismissed. In December Turkish officials issued a warrant for his arrest for the murder of Khashoggi. he is reportedly under house arrest. In April 2019, as a response to Khashoggi's murder, the United States Government banned al-Qahtani and 15 others from entering the United States. Early life Al-Qahtani was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on July 7, 1978. He received a bachelor's degree in law from King Saud University, and graduated with the rank of sergeant from the Royal Saudi Air Force. Al-Qahtani subsequently obtained a master's degree in criminal justice from the Naif Arab University for Security Sciences (NAUSS). Career Al-Qahtani previously worked as a journalist for Elaph and as a contributor for Al Riyadh. After obtaining a law degree, al-Qahtani worked as an adviser to the deputy chief of the royal court. In 2003, he served as a legal advisor to the secretariat to then crown prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. In the early 2000s he was hired by Khaled al-Tuwaijri to protect Saudi Arabia's reputation via an \\"electronic army\\". In 2008, he became responsible for media monitoring for the royal court. Al-Qahtani worked extensively with Hacking Team for espionage purposes. He was also reportedly active on the Hack Forums, using the username Nokia2mon2. He was officially appointed an advisor to the royal court in 2012 and was given the rank of minister in 2015. He was also President and Chairman of the Saudi Federation of Cyber Security, Programming, and Drones (SAFCSP). Al-Qahtani also served on the board of directors of King Abdul Aziz University, the MiSK Foundation, the Royal Commission for Al-Ula, and the Saudi Union for Cyber Security and Programming. 2016 US lobbying, foreign affairs In 2016, Al-Qahtani signed on two US lobbying firms: BGR Group \\"will provide public relations and media management services for The Center [for Studies and Media Affairs at The Saudi Royal Court], which includes both traditional and social media forums,\\" for which they were to be paid US$500,000.00, while Squire Patton Boggs were to be paid $100,000 per month, plus expenses, for \\"legal and strategic policy advice and advocacy on foreign policy and related issues in the U.S. Government\\". During the 2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis, al-Qahtani urged Saudi citizens to identify suspected supporters of Qatar through a \\"Black List\\" hashtag on Twitter. He reportedly oversaw the interrogation of Saad al-Hariri during the 2017 Lebanon–Saudi Arabia dispute. Internal Saudi affairs In 2017, al- Qahtani was an instrumental figure in the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge, luring targets to The Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh by arranging fake meetings there. Al- Qahtani reportedly pressured detainees to sign over assets under threat of torture and imprisonment. In 2018, al-Qahtani reportedly oversaw the torture of several female activists in Saudi Arabia including Loujain al-Hathloul. The activists, who had been campaigning against the male guardianship system and for the right to drive, were reportedly subjected to sexual assault, electrical torture, flogging, and threats of rape and murder. Al-Qahtani was personally present during at least one of the interrogation session and is reported to have personally threatened to rape, murder, and dump the body of one of the activists into the sewers. Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi The United States intelligence community has identified al-Qahtani as the ringleader of the assassination of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Al-Qahtani acted as the head of what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, which has reportedly undertaken at least a dozen operations since 2017. Al-Qahtani had been in contact with Khashoggi since at least October 2017, alerting Khashoggi that his public writings were being monitored. Al-Qahtani was reportedly involved with luring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia, suggesting to Khashoggi that he might be able to work with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. After the assassination of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, al-Qahtani was dismissed as the royal court's supervisor of media affairs. According to Arab and Turkish sources, al-Qahtani organized the Khashoggi operation, even calling into the consulate via Skype to talk with and insult Khashoggi before telling the assembled team: \\"Bring me the head of the dog.\\" The Saudi state prosecutor announced on 15 November 2018 that 11 agents were indicted and 5 charged with murdering Khashoggi. He added that Al- Qahtani met the leader of the team that killed Khashoggi before it was dispatched to Turkey. Al-Qahtani was not arrested. Saudi officials have never revealed the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains. Prince Mohammed bin Salman exchanged at least 11 messages with al-Qahtani in the hours before and after the assassination of Khashoggi, leading the Central Intelligence Agency to conclude that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's murder. A member of the Saudi hit team, Maher Mutreb, also called al-Qahtani to inform him that the operation has been completed. However, the message-exchange element of the report was contested by Saudi Arabia based on a confidential Saudi-commissioned investigation. In November 2018, Saudi authorities confirmed that he was being investigated and was barred to leave the country. On December 5, 2018, the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office requested, and was issued, an arrest warrant for Saud al-Qahtani for the murder of Khashoggi. Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir rejected Turkey's request for al-Qahtani's extradition on December 9, stating that Saudi Arabia does not extradite its citizens. In January 2019, the Saudi authorities were, according to The Washington Post, refusing to confirm the whereabouts of al-Qahtani. There were concerns that he could be influencing the investigation itself. Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the Arab Centre of Washington DC, stated in an interview with Al Jazeera, that al-Qahtani's \\"disappearance\\" was a \\"natural progression of [Saudi Arabia's] investigation\\" and is likely used as a strategy to keep crown prince Mohammed bin Salman protected from accusations regarding Khashoggi's murder: \\"They have sheltered some of the key players accused of being involved [in the murder] whether by Turkey or by the international community. The intention of the Saudi campaign right now is to keep the crown prince clear of any accusations with regards to the murder of Khashoggi.\\" In December 2019, Saudi state TV reported that al-Qahtani was investigated for his role in the murder of Khashoggi but was cleared of any charges as there was no proof of involvement. Five others were sentenced to death and another three given a combined 24-year prison sentence. Agnès Callamard called the Saudi trials for \\"the antithesis of justice\\", and \\"a mockery\\".Jamal Khashoggi: Saudis sentence five to death for journalist's murder, Frank Gardener, 23 December 2019, BBC Hacking Al-Qahtani was known to procure offensive hacking tools on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, among them tools made by the Italian company Hacking Team. On March 5, 2019, The Guardian reported that a strain had developed between King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. March 7, 2019, al-Qahtani reportedly signed an order instructing \\"a technical team to carry out the \\"penetration\\" of the Guardian's computer servers \\"in complete secrecy\\"\\". According to an analysis by FTI Consulting, al-Qahtani procured the tools used to hack Jeff Bezos' mobile phone (CEO of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post) - five months before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. FTI Consulting was asked to look at Bezos' devices after the US tabloid The National Enquirer (publisher American Media Inc owned by David Pecker) exposed Bezos' relationship with his then mistress Lauren Sanchez. Bezos accused Pecker of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing \\"intimate photos\\" he allegedly sent to Sanchez.https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-experts-say- hacking-of-bezoss-phone-suggests-effort-to-influence-news-coverage-11579704647 Bezos' team suggested it was an orchestrated take down by American Media Inc and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Guardian reported that a WhatsApp message sent from the personal account of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was the source of the hack. A UN report came to the same conclusion, experts lent their weight to allegations that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman hacked the mobile phone of Bezos to “influence, if not silence” The Washington Post' reporting.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff- bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, issued the joint statement, which emphasized that \\"at a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post,\\" ... \\"the alleged hacking of Mr. Bezos's phone, and those of others, demands immediate investigation by US and other relevant authorities, including investigation of the continuous, multi-year, direct and personal involvement of the crown prince in efforts to target perceived opponents.\\" UN investigators concluded that Saudi use of the Pegasus spyware, which enables remote surveillance of cellphones, from controversial Israeli technology firm NSO Group was the “most likely explanation” the hacking attack against Bezos. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, has since sued NSO Group in America.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/jeff-bezos-hack- iphone.htmlUN experts call for investigation into allegations that Saudi Crown Prince involved in hacking of Jeff Bezos’ phonehttps://www.al- monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/01/jeff-bezos-amazon-hacked-nso-group-saudi- mohammad-bin-salman.html 2019 alleged death In August 2019, Saudi critic İyad el-Baghdadi tweeted that al-Qahtani had been poisoned. In September 2019 Bloomberg News noted the poisoning rumors, but stated that two people close to al-Qahtani stated that he was still alive.

The large placer mine gold find was one of the first in Alaska and the Anvil Creek Gold Discovery Site was one of the richest placer claim sites ever found in Alaska. It yielded more than $5 million during its first five years. By 1965 the site was \\"largely returned to nature\\". The gold find helped trigger the Nome gold rush.

Fond of sciences, he began studying chemistry in 1884 at the laboratory of the Academy of Neuchâtel in Switzerland, then turned to astronomy. His first communication to the French Academy of Sciences in 1884 deals with an astronomical telescope of its design. In 1885, he became a member of the Astronomical Society of France. He then embarked on developing inventions and in 1887, he designed and made a rangefinder, then in 1888 a small captive helicopter powered by an electric motor attached to a battery on the ground. In 1889 he began experimenting with heavier than air aviation: small airplanes propelled by rockets or kites used as a means of traction, on water or on ice. On August 17, 1889, he made his first flight in an untethered balloon and, with his friend Georges Besançon, in 1889 built the Sirius in which they made a trip from Paris to Le Creusot in 16 hours with a stop in the Yonne Department. In 1890-91, Hermite and Besançon planned a flight over the North Pole but the project did not materialize for lack of funding. The two men began then working on high altitude balloons for scientific purposes. In early 1892, they launched a series of small paper balloons filled with gas to become familiar with the technique. On September 17, the first documented weather balloon in history flew, with a barometer and a minimum thermometer. The ball fell to the ground thanks to a parachute and the instruments could be recovered. Having demonstrated the feasibility of the balloon probe, which he gave the name of weather balloon, and thanks to the support of the Union Aerophile de France, they then launch a series of balloons capable of carrying more than 10,000 meters a nacelle weighing several kilograms containing recording devices which inaugurated a series of international scientific ascents. In 1898 Léon Teisserenc de Bort organized the beginnings of systematic sounding of the atmosphere at the Trappes Observatory of Dynamic Meteorology . Gustave Hermite died on November 9, 1914 in Bois-Colombes, a suburb of Paris.

Opened in 1962, it is located on 18 Bnei Dan Street () in the Yehuda HaMaccabi neighborhood of central Tel Aviv, across from Yarkon Park. History The Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv was opened in 1962, five years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Israel. Its opening coincided with the opening of the Israeli Embassy in Manila that same year. In 2012, the Embassy's website was hacked by a hacker who identified himself as \\"RcP\\" amid increased tension between Israeli troops and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Proposed relocation to Jerusalem In December 2017, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the Philippines was one of at least ten countries reportedly looking to relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following the decision of the United States to do so earlier in the month. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) denied that such a move was being discussed, citing its support for a two-state solution as part of the wider Israeli–Palestinian peace process. DFA Undersecretary Ernesto Abella again denied in August 2018 that the Philippine government was considering moving the Embassy to Jerusalem when he mentioned that it was not a part of President Rodrigo Duterte's agenda for his then-upcoming state visit to Israel. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv is headed by Ambassador Nathaniel G. Imperial, who was appointed to the position by President Benigno Aquino III on June 6, 2014. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Imperial, a career diplomat, had been posted to the Philippine Embassy in Singapore, at one point becoming the mission's chargé d'affaires. His appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on September 17, 2014, and he presented his credentials to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on December 10, 2014. Imperial is set to be succeeded by Macairog S. Alberto, who was appointed by President Duterte on March 12, 2020, and who previously was Commanding General of the Philippine Army. The Embassy's activities center around providing to the welfare of Filipinos in Israel, many of whom are Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). Following the death of a Filipino worker from a bomb explosion in Haifa in 2001, the Embassy organized text brigades to quickly disseminate information to Filipinos throughout the country, while in 2005, Ambassador Antonio Modena protested the treatment of Filipinos entering or exiting Israel, many of whom were subjected to excess security screening or were segregated from other departing or arriving foreigners. In addition to catering to the welfare of Filipinos in Israel, the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv also provides assistance to nationals of member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which do not have a diplomatic presence in Israel, such as with the case of 12 Malaysians detained by Israeli authorities following the Gaza flotilla raid in 2010.

Appendices - Repertory I (p280) and II (p301). London: Threshold Books, 1981.. Synopsis Scene 1: The market After a short overture the scene opens in a bustling market place. Vivacious Mam'zelle Angot, reluctantly engaged to be married to a barber, falls in love with a young caricaturist who introduces himself with a solo in mazurka rhythm, and at first returns her affections. He has drawn a cartoon mocking a senior government official and his aristocratic mistress, but he now becomes entranced with the aristocrat, and forgets his first love. Mam'zelle Angot, jealous, slanders the aristocrat in public realising that her action will cause her arrest, and help her avoid her obligation to marry the barber. A group of unthreatening gendarmes take her away. Scene 2: The house of the aristocrat  A reception is in progress. The aristocrat and official dance a gavotte and three ladies a pas de trois. The caricaturist is discovered in the house, fleeing from the soldiers sent to arrest him for his defamatory caricatures. The scene is witnessed by the lovelorn Mam'zelle Angot; she has been sent for by the aristocrat to explain her behaviour, and the meeting reveals that they are old school friends. The unhappy barber, in search of Mam'zelle Angot, is also present. The government official orders the arrest of the caricaturist, who having spent the ball hidden behind a pillar, chooses this moment to declare his love for the aristocrat. They dance a romantic adagio. Scene 3: The carnival  Mam'zelle Angot has contrived to bring the aristocrat and the caricaturist face to face at the carnival. With the help of her market friends, she exposes the aristocrat to the betrayed government official, who, to a them on the bassoon, has arrived in disguise. The victims of her scheme are roundly mocked, and Mam'zelle Angot decides, after all, that it is the barber whom she loves.

The Rhodope Massif in southern Bulgaria is made up of Archean, Proterozoic and Cambrian rocks and is a sub-province of the Thracian-Anatolian polymetallic province. It has dropped down, faulted basins filled with Cenozoic sediments and volcanic rocks. The Moesian Platform to the north extends into Romania and has Paleozoic rocks covered by rocks from the Mesozoic, typically buried by thick Danube River valley Quaternary sediments. In places, the Moesian Platform has small oil and gas fields. Bulgaria is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. Geologic History & Stratigraphy Archean rocks outcrop in the south and west of Bulgaria as part of an ultrametamorphosed polymetamorphic complex including low-grade migmatite, gneissoid granite, and anatexite. Marble, amphibolite and gneiss from the Proterozoic are found in the Rhodope Massif. During the Precambrian, the Variscan Thracian Suture was part of the Balkan-Carpathian ophiolite segment. This feature left behind a highly stratified obducted ophiolite island arc assemblage with tectonized peridotite, dunite, lherzolite, wehrlite and troctolite, as well as pillow lava meta-basalt, and sheeted dikes of micro-gabbro and dolerite. Outcropping in the northwest, these rocks were originally part of the suture north a large landmass and south of the Moesian Platform rocks. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) At the outset of the Paleozoic, Cambrian age politic sediments formed together with volcanic rocks such as keratophyre, spilite, and pyroclastic flows, associated with tholeiitic island arc volcanism. Ordovician, Silurian and Middle Devonian shale and lydite (a form of siliceous argillite rich in graptolite fossils) outcrops in the west. The Caledonian orogeny affected the region in the Middle Devonian through the Carboniferous. Carbonates deposited, along with a basin filled with turbidites between two landmasses. Lakes were common during the late Paleozoic, depositing anthracite coal now found north of Varna and Sofia. Permian rocks reflect terrestrial sedimentation and dry land conditions and contain some coal as well as thick conglomerate layers. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the Triassic, the lithospheric plates of the Moesian Platform in the north and the Rhodope Massif in the south continued to interact. At the beginning of the Mesozoic, red sandstones were depositing in terrestrial conditions, but as time passed the region became submerged during a marine transgression, kicking off carbonate deposition. During the Ladinian, the central part of the basin reached greater depths below water and experienced anoxic conditions, leading to the formation of organic-rich black shale. The late Triassic brought a marine regression, reducing water levels and returning to platform carbonate formation and then by the Norian carbonate breccia formed as dry land conditions prevailed. In the northwest, there are some signs of volcanism from the time, including continental rift trachyandesite and andesite-basalt eruptions. In the east, particularly within the East Balkan Range, are olistolith remnants as an allochthon of Triassic rocks in Middle Jurassic black shales. Triassic rocks include turbidite sandstone and sub-reefal limestone. In Srednogorie, they form a sizeable nappe with phyllite, amphibolite, calcareous schist and turbidites as well as marble. During the Jurassic, a marine transgression began, flooding the entire region by the Callovian. Early Jurassic rocks include basal sandstone and limestone, rich in ammonite, bivalve and brachiopod fossils. A deepwater basin, likely branched off the Paleotethys Ocean was discovered in the East Balkan Range. It was bordered to the south by a turbidite basin with red marl and limestone. The center of the basin witnessed black shale deposition in the Middle Jurassic while the edges deposited biomicritic limestone. The northwest and northeast formed platform limestones, separated by a \\"groove\\" of pelagic micrite and nodular limestone. This sedimentation pattern continued into the Cretaceous, until the Barremian when reef limestones and marl began to build up. An orogeny began in Austria at the end of the Albian, reducing sea levels and confining marine environments to the northwest. By the late Cretaceous, epicontinental limestones were depositing on the Moesian Platform in the north. An island arc developed in the south, while the South Carpathians trough appeared in the northwest, filling with turbidite and marl. Intensive igneous activity began due to subduction in the area of Srednogorie. Deepwater sedimentation with pelagic limestone and turbidites, together with volcanic rocks such as tholeiitic, calc-alkaline or shoshonite rocks mark the late Cretaceous. In fact, rocks near Srednogorie often contain copper ores. The events of the late Cretaceous were the first signs globally of the formation of the Alpine- Himalayan mountain belt.

The group's goal was to prevent divorce, primarily by teaching women to win back or change their husbands, reflecting the societal views of the time. History The group was founded in 1949 by Samuel Starr, a Chicago divorce attorney who believed almost all divorced couples regretted that decision. The name, without a doubt, derived from organizations as Alcoholics Anonymous. According to Starr, the group started when he was loath to take on a new divorce case for a prospective client couple, believing them to be focused only on \\"some little peeves.\\" His next client that day was a regretful divorcee, who either at her own suggestion or Starr's, successfully counseled the couple to remain together. Starr then recruited other divorced female clients to do the same work, and the group grew from five members to 100 within a month.Celello, Kristin.

The hearing was a result of concerns raised by members of the public on the 1993 releases of Night Trap and Mortal Kombat for home consoles. Besides general concerns related to violence in video games, the situation had been inflamed by a moral panic over gun violence, as well as the state of the industry and an intense rivalry between Sega and Nintendo. The hearings, led by Senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl, put the video game companies to task for the realistic depiction of violence in video games, and threatened that Congress would take action to regulate the industry if they did not take steps themselves. As a result, the American video game industry created the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the Entertainment Software Association) in July 1994 to serve as an advocacy group for the industry, and subsequently formed the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to provide content ratings on video games sold at retail in North America. Background Since as early as 1970s, video games have been criticized for having violent content that may influence those that play the games. In 1982, the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop asserted that video games may be affecting the health and well-being of young people and were potentially addictive. However, until the 1990s, the perceived target market for video games was generally for children, and manufacturers of video games typically did not include high levels of graphic violence in their games. Most computer game software would be sold through toy stores like Toys 'R' Us or general retail outlets like Sears and Wal-Mart, rather than computer stores. State of the industry By 1993, the video game industry had recovered from the 1983 crash, and was estimated to be worth . Video game consoles had reached the 16-bit era with the ability to support higher resolution graphics. Alongside this, video games had started to draw older players, creating a market for games with more mature content, both on home consoles and in arcades. During this period, two key players were Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been instrumental in helping to recover the North American market after the crash with the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); in 1990, Nintendo sales accounted for 90% of the US market. It's successor system, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), was released in 1991. However, to avoid repeating one of the issues that caused the crash, Nintendo took care to limit and review what third-party games could be made for its platforms to avoid a glut of poor games. Sega, which had already released its Sega Genesis in the US in 1989, found their sales to be lagging behind Nintendo. In an aggressive campaign aimed at the United States market, Sega heavily pushed the game Sonic the Hedgehog, with its titular character aimed to become Sega's mascot and rival that of Nintendo's Mario. Sega was also less selective about which games it allowed on the platform, allowing many more third-party games onto the system to increase its library in contrast to Nintendo's. Further, Sega used marketing language purposely aimed at Nintendo, such as \\"Sega does what Nintendon't\\". By 1992, Sega had obtained 65% of the US gaming market, overtaking Nintendo's dominant position. Subsequently, a strong rivalry between Nintendo and Sega was formed, referred as the \\"Console Wars\\", which continued through the next decade and into the fifth generation of consoles, after which Sega dropped out of the hardware market and became principally a game developer and publisher, and at times working collaboratively with Nintendo. Existing content ratings system Prior to 1994, the video game industry did not have a unified content rating system. Entering 1993, the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Better Business Bureau had heard rumblings from politicians that the content of video games was under scrutiny, and sent word to its board members, Sega and Nintendo. Sega agreed that they should have a ratings system, and had developed its Videogame Rating Council in June 1993 in association independent educators, psychologists, child development experts and sociologists. The Videogames Rating Council had three principle ratings for games released on the Genesis platform: GA for General Audiences, MA-13 for games intended for those thirteen years and older, and MA-17 for those 17 years and older. Sega debuted their system in June 1993 just prior to the release of Mortal Kombat for the Genesis, knowing the ratings system would help mitigate concerns over the violent content in the game. Nintendo did not have a ratings system, but as it had control over the cartridge manufacturing process, it would only publish games they felt appropriate for a family console. Nintendo also refused to use Sega's ratings solution due to their continued corporate rivalry. A further difficulty for the industry was that there was no established trade group for the video game industry. While many of the game publishers belonged to the Software Publishers Association, this group represented more practical software interests, such as word processors and spreadsheets, and the Association did not hold the entertainment software membership in high regard. Mortal Kombat Fighting games had become a lucrative property after the release of Capcom's arcade Street Fighter II: The World Warrior in 1991, which established many conventions of the genre. While Sega lured many of Nintendo's third-party developers to break their exclusivity agreements to publish games only for the Nintendo consoles, Capcom remained loyal to Nintendo, licensing only a few titles to Sega to publish, and only the SNES received the home console port of Street Fighter II in 1992, which was said to help keep the SNES sales ahead of the Genesis in the United States for that year. Numerous other fighting games followed to try to capture on Street Fighter II success, but most notably was Midway's Mortal Kombat, first released as an arcade game in 1992. Mortal Kombat was highly controversial at its release: as a fighter game, the game has photo-realistic sprites of the game's characters, graphic spurting of blood on several hits, and a number of \\"fatalities\\" such as decapitation or impaling a body on spikes. Despite the game's advertising indicating the game was meant for mature audiences, the perception that video games were still aimed at children caused parents and other concerned groups to criticize the violence within the game. However, at this point, Mortal Kombat was only an arcade game, making it relatively easy to segregate it from other arcade games if necessary. Greg Fischbach, the co-founder and CEO of Acclaim Entertainment, the company that had secured the license for home console versions of the game, said while attention to the game from the negative press helped to boost its popularity, that \\"We didn't want that press or publicity\\" and recognized that the industry may need to take steps to quell similar problems in the future. Because of its success in the arcade, Acclaim Entertainment started to bring Mortal Kombat to various home consoles. Both Sega and Nintendo both sought the game for their consoles, the Genesis and the SNES, respectively. Both companies recognized the issue with the level of gore in the game, but took very different approaches. Sega, staying with their attempt to capture as much of the market, went with trying to keep as much of the visual gore from the arcade game in place. While the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat as shipped eliminated the blood and fatalities, they could be activated via the use of a well-published cheat code. As the game, as shipped, did not include the blood and gore, Sega labelled it with their MA-13 VRC label. On the other hand, Nintendo wanted to keep games on their system appropriate for families and children, and required Acclaim to change the red blood to grey sweat, edit the fatalities, and change other parts of the game's artwork to remove elements like severed heads on spikes. Sega's version of Mortal Kombat outsold Nintendo's by a factor of five. This furthered the existing rivalry between the two companies. Night Trap Night Trap is a 1992 game developed by Digital Pictures and released on the Sega CD, a CD-ROM attachment for the Sega Genesis. Night Trap is presented as an interactive movie, using full-motion video to show scenes and allowing players to choose their next option, creating divergence in the story. The game's narration centered on the disappearance of teenage girls (starring Dana Plato) at a winery estate, tied in with the appearance of vampire-like beings that feed on young females. Subsequently, the video scenes often veered into some sexually-alluring context as well as violence with various encounters. Night Trap drew criticism worldwide, but which helped to publicize it. Similar issues were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that \\"Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity... Questions were even raised in the UK Parliament about its suitability. This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only served to reinforce that image.\\" However, in retrospective, much of this criticism was deemed misguided. Steven L. Kent writes that \\"Reading the transcripts of the 1993 hearings, it is hard to believe that anybody had ever actually played Night Trap. Few people bothered to acknowledge that the goal of Night Trap was not to kill women but to save them from vampires. Players did not even kill the vampires—they simply trapped them in Rube Goldberg–like booby traps. Nearly everyone who referred to Night Trap mentioned a scene in which a girl in a rather modest teddy is caught by the vampires and killed. The scene was meant to show players that they had lost and allowed too many vampires into the house.\\" Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com noted that \\"its game objectives were mischaracterized either through ignorance or deliberate obfuscation, transforming it from bland and barely titillating FMV adventure to child-corrupting sexual boogeyman.\\" Lethal Enforcers Lethal Enforcers was a 1992 arcade game released in 1992 by Konami which used light guns; the player takes the role of a police officer to lethally take down criminals while avoiding killing innocents or being shot by criminals. The game was rendered using photo-realistic imagery which drew some concern. It was ported to home consoles the next year (on Sega systems in late 1993, and on the SNES by early 1994). These games shipped with the Konami Justifier, a plastic light gun modeled after a revolver. Moral panic around gun violence In the months prior to the hearings, there had been a small moral panic in America on gun-related crimes, which fueled the concerns related to violent video games. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun-related homicides had reached record highs in 1993 since the 1970s. Both Congress and the Justice Department were looking to reduce the amount of violence on television. Congressional concern alt=A man in a formal suit standing in front of national and state flags. The violence in video games became a concern after Mortal Kombats home console release in September 1992. One of Senator Joe Lieberman's former chief of staff, Bill Andresen, had been asked by his son to purchase the Sega version of Mortal Kombat for him. Andresen was appalled by the amount of violence in the game, and approached Lieberman on the matter. Lieberman was also shocked by the content of the game and began gathering more information. Lieberman had stated he had heard about Night Trap, evaluated the game himself, and also recognized its content as problematic. By December 1, 1993, Lieberman held a press conference alongside other children's advocates including \\"Captain Kangaroo\\", Bob Keeshan. Lieberman stated his intention to open a congressional hearing the following week to address the issue of violent video games and the lack of content ratings, and his plans to introduce an ratings body through legislation to regulate the video game industry. During the conference, he showed footage from Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, and other games. Lieberman's research concluded that the average video game player at the time was between seven and twelve years old, and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children. Lieberman commented on the sales of Mortal Kombat to date, having sold 3 million copies by that point and was estimated to bring in over by the end of the year, demonstrating the greed of the industry to use violence to cater to children. Of Night Trap, Lieberman said \\"I looked at that game, too, and there was a classic. It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. I know that the creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of Dracula; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message.\\" Lieberman stated \\"Few parents would buy these games for their kids if they knew what was in them\\" and \\"We're talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable.\\" Lieberman subsequently stated that while he'd \\"like to ban all the violent video games\\", he knew this would conflict with the First Amendment, and instead wanted to seek a solution involving a content ratings system, which he felt would not impede First Amendment rights. Hearings First hearing The first hearing was held on December 9, 1993, in front of the combined Governmental Affairs and Judiciary Senate committees. At the time, Senate was on recess, so the only Senators present were Lieberman, Kohl and Byron Dorgan. Hours before the hearing, representatives of the video game industry announced that they have agreed to endorse and develop an industry-standard video game content ratings system, as an attempt to defuse the bad publicity of the hearings. This announcement was referred to several times throughout the first hearing. Speaking witnesses to the panel included: * Dr. Parker Page of the Children's Television Resource and Education Center * Professor Eugene Povenzo of the University of Miami and author of the recently published Video Kids: Making Sense of Nintendo (1991) * Robert Chase of National Education Association * Marilyn Droz of the National Coalition on Television Violence * Howard Lincoln, vice president of Nintendo of America * Bill White, vice president of Sega of America * Ilene Rosenthal, General Counsel, Software Publishers Association * Dawn Weiner, Video Software Dealers Association * Craig Johnson, Past-President, Amusement and Music Operators Association The first half of the hearing was devoted to the experts on education and child psychology. These four discussed their concerns and findings on the impact of violence in video games on children. Chase stated \\"Electronic games, because they are active rather than passive, can do more than desensitize impressionable children to violence. They actually encourage violence as the resolution of first resort by rewarding participants for killing one’s opponents in the most grisly ways imaginable.\\" Povenzo iterated his findings in writing Video Kids, stated that recent games had become \\"overwhelmingly violent, sexist, and racist\\", and affirmed that he felt that with games like Night Trap, the industry was \\"endorsing violence\\" and further called for a ratings system. Droz stated that children \\"need action, but they do not need to find murder as a form of entertainment\\". The second half of the hearing focused on the industry representatives. During the hearing, both Sega and Nintendo continued their ongoing rivalry, accusing the other of the reason behind the hearings. Nintendo's Lincoln had led off his part of the testimony by acknowledging Nintendo's action to remove some of the violence of Mortal Kombat, which observers found gave Lincoln more respect from Lieberman than Sega's White received. One of White's key points was the transformation of the video game industry from primarily having a younger audience to an adult, and that Night Trap was meant only for adults. Lincoln retorted these claims, telling White, \\"I can't just sit here and allow you to be told that the video game industry has been transformed from children [as primary consumers] to adults.\\" White referred to statistics collected from warranty cards on hardware and game sales that Sega kept and Nintendo would have also kept to justify the older demographics of current video games. Further, Lincoln asserted that Sega only developed its rating system after the release of Night Trap and only started to label its games after the game was criticized by consumers. White responded by showing a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games, which at this point, Nintendo lacked. Of Lethal Enforcers, Lieberman criticized the design of the Konami Enforcer to resemble a revolver; an infamous still of C-SPAN's coverage of the hearings was Lieberman holding up the Enforcer to talk about its realistic nature. Sega's White countered that Nintendo had a similar light gun product on the market, the Super Scope, that was shaped after a bazooka. Lieberman asserted that both the Enforcer and Super Scope looked too much like real weapons and should not be in the hands of children. Lieberman was also critical of how the video game industry company approached advertising. During the hearing it showcased a Sega television advertisement where a school-aged child wins several video games over others, and then makes the other students obey his commands. Lieberman also expressed concern on Sega's Videogame Ratings Council, that while the ratings were reasonable, there was no standardization of how they were displayed, sometimes only printed on the game cartridge itself, and thus preventing parents from being able to review these before purchase. Kohl warned the video game publishers that \\"If you don't do something about [content ratings], we will.\\" speaking to the start of a bill Lieberman had been drafting that would have the government become involved in a ratings system. By the end of the hearing, Sega and Nintendo said they would commit themselves towards working with retail outlets including Sears and Toys 'R' Us to create a voluntary content ratings system to denote any violence or sexual content in their games, to be modeled after the film rating system created by the Motion Picture Association of America. At the conclusion of the first hearing, Lieberman decided they would have a second session in a few months to see on the progress of the industry on this effort. Video Game Rating Act of 1994 Following the December 1993 hearing, Senator Lieberman, co-sponsored by Kohl and Dorgan, introduced the Video Games Rating Act of 1994 (S.1823) on February 3, 1994 to the Senate; the equivalent bill (H.R.3785) was introduced to the House of Representatives by Tom Lantos. The Act, if passed, would have established an Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission, a five- member panel appointed by the President. This commission would then have coordinated with the video game industry to develop a ratings system and method of disseminating information related to violence and sexually explicit content to potential buyers. Lieberman asserted that the bill had been presented as to coerce the video game industry to take voluntary action themselves to come up with a ratings system, but that he had no plans to follow through on the bill should the industry come to an agreement. Interim events As a result of the Congressional hearings, Night Trap started to generate more sales. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, \\"You know, I sold 50,000 units of Night Trap a week after those hearings.\\" Two weeks before Christmas 1993, Night Trap was removed from store shelves in the US's two largest toy store chains, Toys \\"R\\" Us and Kay-Bee Toys, after receiving numerous complaints. Michael Goldstein, the vice president of Toys 'R' Us, stated in mid-December that this was \\"a decision we made several weeks ago with the concurrence of Sega, which agrees with our decision\\". Sega withdrew Night Trap from all retail markets in January 1994, but not after selling over 250,000 copies. Bill White, Sega Vice President of Marketing, stated that Night Trap was pulled because the continued controversy surrounding it prevented constructive dialogue about an industry-wide rating system. Sega also stated at the time they would later release a censored version pending the establishment of an industry-wide ratings system. Second hearing The second hearing was held on March 5, 1994, which included as speakers: * Congressman Tom Lantos * Jack Heistand, Senior Vice President for Electronic Arts * Mary Evan, Vice President of Store Operations, Babbages * Chuck Kerby, Divisional Merchandise Manager, Wal-Mart * Steve Loenigsberg, President, American Amusement Machine Association * R.A. Green, III, Amusements & Music Operator Association Heistand presented himself as part of the newly formed Interactive Entertainment Industry Rating Commission, the industry group working to establish the desired ratings systems. He reported to the joint committee that seven companies, including Electronic Arts, Sega, Nintendo, Atari, Acclaim, Philips and 3DO, representing about 60% of video game software in the United States, had committed to developing an industry software ratings board. Heistand said they anticipated to have come to agreements on the ratings standards by June 1994, such that by November of that year (in time for the holiday shopping season), they will be able to rate all new games coming to the market going forward, an estimated 2,500 games per year. However, Heistand also reported that the industry said there would too much effort to review all previously released games. Heistand also cautioned that the system may not take off if they could not get other software developers outside the group to also sign on to support the ratings system. Lieberman acknowledged the proposed system as a critical step towards helping parents make informed decisions, but cautioned that until the rating system was in place, they would not be removing the proposed bill from their agenda. Retailers such as Wal-Mart, Toys \\"R\\" Us, and Babbages agreed that they would only stock games that have received these ratings, though had not yet decided on how to handle selling games rating for adults to children. The Senators still expressed concern at the type of content the industry was willing to produce. Kohl stated \\"Let me give you my honest perspective on this issue: Violent video games that degrade women are harmful to our children and are garbage...But we live by and cherish a Constitution that prevents government from censoring material. So we will try to live with a rating system\\". Lieberman stated \\"'the video game industry had practiced self-restraint before now, we wouldn't be here today\\". Reactions An example of an ESRB rating for a video game, a result of the hearings, which identify both the age category and content descriptors for the game By April 1994, the coalition of companies represented by Heistand established the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), with Acclaim's Fischbach serving as its initial CEO. One of the first tasks taken by the IDSA was to establish the promised rating system. While Sega offered their existing VRC as a basis, Nintendo, among others, steadfastly refused as they did not want to have to deal with anything created by their main competitor. Instead, a vendor-independent solution was developed, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), with a new set of rating standards developed in conjunction with parents and educators. The ESRB ratings system was modeled after the Motion Picture Association of America, defining five age-related categories, but also adding a set of descriptive terms that would appear next to the rating to describe the specific content that would be found in the game. The ESRB was formally introduced to Congress in July 1994 to show that they had met Lieberman's goal, and the Board became officially active on September 13, 1994. Lieberman stated in a 2017 interview that the video game industry \\"actually came up with a rating system that I think at the time — I honestly haven't been back to this in a long time — was the best. Much better than the movies.\\" The IDSA also served to become the industry trade association to help advocate for the industry to the government and other groups. Eventually, IDSA was renamed to the Entertainment Software Association and launched the industry's principle trade show, the Electronic Entertainment Expo. While The 3DO Company had stated they would help back an industry-wide solution to content ratings, they concurrently developed their own 3DO Rating System for games released on the 3DO platform. The 3DO system was voluntary and unlike the ESRB, allowed the publisher to select the rating. Publishers of 3DO games were split whether to use the ESRB or 3DO system. Ultimately, 3DO exited the hardware business around 1996, nullifying the need of the 3DO Rating System. Separately, the Software Publishers Association (now the Software and Information Industry Association), the Association of Shareware Professionals, and other groups that represented developers of video game software on personal computers felt that the proposed ESRB system, which was based principally on age ratings, was not sufficient and wanted to inform parents to the specific types of content that would be in their games. These groups developed the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) in 1994 which rated games in three areas: violence, sexual content, and language, with each being rated among five levels. The following year, the RSAC system was also developed for Internet cites under the \\"RSACi\\" system. By 1999, RSAC and RSACi were transitioned to the Internet Content Rating Association dedicated specifically for rating Internet content, while software developers adopted the ESRB system for their games. Legacy Senator Lieberman continued to monitor the video game industry following the hearings, a general part of his own position related to violent content from entertainment industries. In 1997, he stated that one of his intentions of the 1993 hearings was to have the industry regulate how much violence that the video game industry was putting into its games by having them implement the ratings system, but felt that \\"The rating system has not stopped game producers from putting out some very violent games.\\" Mortal Kombat II was released to arcades in its final form by January 1994, and to home consoles later that year. Among other changes, the game added a variation on the \\"fatalities\\", called \\"Friendships\\", which would occur if the player performed a separate move mechanically similar to a fatality; in such a case, the winning fighter would do a non-hostile action, such as giving the defeated fighter a virtual present. According to John Tobias, co-creator of Mortal Kombat, these friendships were added due to response from the Congressional hearings. When the home console versions were released, after the establishment for the ESRB, Nintendo did not take issue with the amount of violence in the game, and allowed it to release without any changes on the SNES. The SNES version of Mortal Kombat II outsold the Sega Genesis version that year. id Software's Doom, a first-person shooter where the player fought hellish creatures and included graphic violence, was released on December 10, 1993, the day following the first hearing. Outside of the hearings, there was concern by parents and other organizations on the violence in this game as well. While Doom was not mentioned in either Senate hearing, it would come up again in 1999 following the Columbine High School massacre, where the perpetrators had described their planned attack as something straight out of Doom. As a result, Doom is frequently classified along with Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, and Lethal Enforcers as early examples of violent video games highlighted by the media. At the time of the hearings, video games were not established as a protected form of speech covered under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, though Lieberman and others had stated their concerns about First Amendment rights through censoring violent games and sought the ratings approach. Since the formation of the ESRB, attempts have been made by lawmakers at federal and state levels to restrict video game sales by their ESRB rating, principally in regards to their level of violence. In a landmark case in 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n that video games are an art form, protected by the First Amendment. The ruling found that while states can pass laws to block the sale of \\"obscene\\" video games to minors, violence would not fall within the Miller test of what is considered obscene. One of Howard Lincoln's statements during the first hearing was \\"Let me say for the record, I want to state that Night Trap will never appear on a Nintendo System.\\" The statement was jokingly referred to in 2018 when a remake of Night Trap for its 25th anniversary was announced for release on the Nintendo Switch among other systems.

Hurray is a street game, usually played outside on an asphalt surface. The game gained mass popularity in the late 1980s, with many streets and car parks appearing in the game's drawing from oil paintings or chalk.  Rules  Hurray involves two teams with an undetermined but equal number of players, located in field one and field two. The goal is for each team to get out of their field, through the corridor, outside their field, enter the other team's field by passing through the corridor and step on the triangle, situated on the far corner of the field, shouting \\"Hurrah\\". As the player passes through the corridors, he is not allowed to step on or out of the drawing because he will be \\"burned\\" (taken out of the game). Players from the opposing team - from their field or already out of the drawing - can pull or push players to make a line or go out of the drawing. When a player is in an angle circle called a corner, no one can pull or push him. Out-of-the-field players from the opposing teams can not push each other inside the corner.

In the first part of her book The Genus Rosa, Ellen Willmott described a rose that is known by the Gilaks as \\"Gul e Reschti\\", which is probably the same as Rose de Rescht. History The history of the flower is unclear and its origin is unknown; according to some researches done in France and England by the members of the WFRS Specialized Conservation Committee, the rose was originally introduced \\"about 1880\\" as a Persian rose and, in some sources, its origin is French. It seems that this rose originating in Iran was reported in the year 1880 in England, then in the year 1890 in Germany, but it was then forgotten and was not reintroduced to England until 1940–1950, when it was rediscovered in Rasht. Description Rosa de Rescht's bloom form is double, their color is deep pink (dp) and they are highly fragrant. The plant has large, medium green foliage, grows about 90 to 120 centimetres (36–48 in) high and 60–90 centimetres (24–36 in) wide. It is winter hardy down to USDA Zone 4b −31.7 °C (-25 °F) . Flowering time is late spring/early summer; it blooms repeatedly. It is resistant to black spot, mildew and rust. Its soil pH requirement is 5.6 to 6.5 (acidic to mildly acidic). It can be propagated by softwood cuttings, semi-hardwood cuttings, hardwood cuttings, grafting and budding. Namesake Lindsay named the cultivar 'de Rescht' after the city of Rasht, the capital of Gilan Province, Iran, located along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, where she discovered it to be growing.

Their father, Peter Mellish Sr., had been a butcher in Shadwell, and they bid to supply the Navy with beef under a competitive tendering procedure. Thus, for example, in 1794 they won the contract to supply 3,000 head of oxen for sea stores. His third son, also named William Mellish, was a Tory politician, three times a Member of Parliament. He was also a banker and Governor of the Bank of England from 1814 to 1816. His estate was worth about £3m when he died. He had two heirs his daughters Elizabeth and Margaret Lauretta, who both married improvident aristocrats: Elizabeth married Lord Edward Thynne in 1830 and Margaret Richard Butler, 2nd Earl of Glengall in 1834. In 1847 Elizabeth unsuccessfully attempted to gain a greater share of their father's estate with a court case. The trustees of the estate also felt concern over the profligacy of the Earl of Glengall, who went bankrupt in 1849, a status he retained until his death in 1858. The trustees were able to sell much of the family estates in Ireland in 1853 through the Encumbered Estates' Court, with much of the land being subsequently bought back.

She initially reached out to her friend, writer Jane Urquhart, hoping she would write about the Larsson's, but Urquhart instead encouraged Ashenburg to write a novel about them herself. A work of fiction, the titular characters are loosely based on Karin Bergöö Larsson wife of Swedish artist Carl Larsson and Emma Lamm, wife of Swedish artist Anders Zorn. The novel follows the lives of the two titular characters, Sofie Olsson (based on Karin Bergöö Larsson) and Cecilia Vogt (based on Emma Lamm), Swedish women who are both married to artists, who meet in their 30s and develop a life long friendship. Plot In 1901 Sofie Olsson and her husband Nils, along with their children, travel to visit Lars Vogt and his wife Cecilia. Though Nils and Lars are artist colleagues and friends, Sofie and Cecilia barely know each other. Sofie admires Cecilia, but after sending her a thank you letter for the visit Sofie comes to believe that Cecilia does not want her friendship. Sofie Sofie is born Sofie Falkner and in 1882 leaves her small village to attend the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. Like the other female students she is segregated from the male students and is not allowed to draw nudes. Sofie and the other female students settle on drawing scenes drawn from their domestic life and while Sofie does not distinguish herself at school she continues to paint after graduation. Post-graduation Sofie meets Nils Olsson and while studying in France the two fall in love and decide to marry. Nils has regressive and sexist attitudes towards women painters which Sofie ignores, eventually accepting that she needs to give up drawing and painting once she marries Nils. She settles into domestic life and mostly defers to Nils, channelling her creativity into raising their children and decorating their home. The Olsson home becomes famous for being an example of Swedish craftsmanship and after Sophia Magdalena of Denmark visits her home, Sofie finds herself renewing her friendship with Cecilia, with the two becoming much better acquainted. Sofie's artwork, particular her weaving, manages to attract attention over the years. Cecilia suggests she market her designs, and a Scottish artist of the applied arts, MacDonald Lawrie, is interested in exhibiting her work. Despite not having explicit instructions from Nils to do so, Sofie declines all offers to expand her work and take it public. Sofie also becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her marriage as she hears rumours that Nils has fathered children with other women and she continues to grieve the loss of her painting. Sofie and Mr. Lawrie keep up their friendship with Lawrie eventually confessing his love for her in 1914. Sofie gently rebuffs him despite no longer being in love with Nils. In 1915 Sofie's eldest son, Markus, dies from an infection after having his appendix removed. The one time that Sofie drew during her marriage was when she was suffering from postpartum depression after Markus was born. When he is dead she once again draws him as she remembers him. Through Markus's death she also meets Dora Helmersen, a photographer who photographs the dead. As Markus was interested in photography prior to his death Sofie tries to learn a little about photography through Dora, eventually seeing the experimental work she has done. Though Sofie does not always admire Dora's work she does realize she is an artist. Cecilia Cecilia is born into a wealthy Jewish family of textile manufacturers. She meets Lars Vogt when he is painting a portrait of her nephew and she is assigned to calm her nephew and keep him still. When they wish to become engaged she is surprised that her family is not upset by his Christianity but because he is poor. To get her family to agree to the marriage Lars and Cecilia agree to a secret engagement of at most five years until Lars can establish himself as a successful artist but he manages to secure his fortune in four and the couple are wed and move to France. While there Cecilia assumes they are happy, but is shocked when she discovers a condom despite the fact that the couple are trying to conceive. Lars openly admits to having an affair and Cecilia decides to forgive him. By 1899 Lars has become so successful the Vogts decide to move back to Sweden. By this time Cecilia has grown accustomed to Lars's many affairs, but she holds out hope that they will be able to have children. When she returns the Olsson's visit in 1901 she is pregnant with a child but on the train ride home she has a miscarriage. Lars grows more and more successful, going to America where he makes enough money that the Vogt's become very rich and are able to be patrons of the small village where Lars was raised with Cecilia helping to run the orphanage and a school that teaches adult literacy and craftsmanship. Cecilia continues to tolerate Lars's affairs with models, but when he sleeps with one of Cecilia's maids she is furious, especially when she confronts him and realizes he is bored. From then on she sleeps with him only as a means to get pregnant, and when she reaches menopause their sex life ceases altogether. Cecilia and Lars decide to turn their home into a museum after their deaths and hire a recent university graduate, Lisbeth Gregorius to help them undertake the project. Cecilia is charmed by her as she is completely indifferent to Lars's attempts to seduce her. The two grow very friendly and in 1916 they begin a sexual affair. Red In 1924 Nils abruptly dies shortly after completing his memoirs. Sofie's children try to block publication due to several unsavoury themes, but to their surprise Sofie does not want the book censored and is only angered by the book because it makes no mention of the fact that she was a painter and that she was also responsible for much of the design work in their house. She privately returns to painting. Lars falls out of critical favour as a painter though he remains more financially successful than ever. In 1931 he suffers from a stroke and Cecilia is led to believe he will die quickly. Contrary to the doctor's opinion Lars clings to life though now he is wholly dependent on Cecilia and the servants leading her to think of him as the child she never had. By 1933 Cecilia is growing concerned with the rise in anti-semitism while Lisbeth, who is still her lover, is unconcerned and thinks she is being too reactionary. At a local festival presented by Cecilia, Sofie accidentally sees them almost kissing and begins to suspect what members of her family have been aware of for some time: Cecilia and Lisbeth are lovers. In 1934 MacDonald Lawrie returns to Askebo, Sofie's village, and proposes marriage. Sofie accepts but quickly realizes she does not want to live in Scotland and breaks the brief engagement. As the years go by Sofie and Cecilia draw closer together, both more openly talking about their difficulties in being married to promiscuous men and about their passion for their work. Sofie reveals her paintings to her family and then finally to Cecilia who suggests that she move from the watercolours that were Nils's domain into oil paints. Sofie takes up her suggestion and shortly after receives a call from Lisbeth who informs her that Cecilia has died after a long illness which she kept hidden. Sofie attends Cecilia's funeral where she is buried in a churchyard after her family gives her a private Jewish ceremony. Returning home Sofie returns to painting.

Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the southeast, Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Moldova to the east. Structural geology Geologists subdivide Romania into several structural groupings: *Scythian Platform: A platform spanning from eastern Romania to Crimea. Complex folding of Precambrian and Paleozoic basement rocks, slate, Ordovician sandstone, Silurian shale, and Devonian marl and sandstone. Platform cover rocks include Devonian limestone, Triassic basic detrital rocks and carbonates, Jurassic marl and sand as well as Neogene shallow water sediments typical of the Carpathian Foreland. *Moesian Platform: Southern part of the Carpathian Foreland, separated from the Scythian Platform by the North Dobogrea Orogen. Basement rocks are metamorphic and date to the Precambrian. It has four cycles of cover rocks, including detrital material from the Paleozoic, Triassic carbonate and shale, Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonates and Eocene calcareous and detrital rocks. *North Dobogrea Orogen: Separated from the Moesian Platform by the Peceneaga-Camena Fault. Includes several nappe features. The orogen extends offshore into the Black Sea continental plateau Carpathian Orogen The Carpathian Orogen folded belt lies 40 percent within Romania. It includes the Main Tethyan Suture (the deformed remains of the Tethys Ocean crust) between the Foreapulian Block and the continental margin of Europe. The inner zone of the orogen was deformed during the Cretaceous, while the outer zones deformed during the Neogene. The inner zone is overlain by the Transylvanian and Pannonian basin Neogen molasse depressions and an additional molasse from the same period overlies the outer zone. Subduction produced two calc-alkaline magmatic arcs. The Eastern Carpathians consist of two main paleogeographic and structural units. From east to west, they are the inner crystalline zone and the outer Flysch zone. https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/282/chapter/3795409/geology-of- romania Geologic History The Pan-African orogeny in the late Proterozoic impacted rocks in the Carpathian Forelands. In the Paleozoic, mobile areas formed south and west of the East European Platform, producing the Scythian Platform and the metamorphic rocks of the Carpathians. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Rifting began in the early Mesozoic, in the North Dobogrea-South Crimea Aulacogen, likely related to the strike-slip movement of the Tornquist-Teysseire Lineament. Ocean rifting through the Triassic separated Europe from the Preapulian Block. As the spreading of the Tethys Ocean continued, the Moesian Platform was rotated to the northwest and North Dobogrea experienced compression. The crust began to shorten and compress in the area of the Carpathian Mountains, as the Transylvanian nappe formations were obducted onto the edge of the continent. Simultaneously, the North Dobogrea orogenic belt became part of the stable craton of the Carpathian foreland. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) In the early Paleogene, as the Tethys Ocean closed the Moldovian and Pienidian domain experienced flysch sedimentation and became deformed during the Miocene. Subduction of Tethys Ocean crust led to calc-alkalkine volcanism in the Senonian through the Paleocene and again in the Apuseni Mountains in the Neogene. The opening of the Black Sea, forced the increasingly deformed Moesian Platform to the west and molasse basins developed around the rising Carpathians in the Neogene. Natural resource geology Some of the oldest resources in Romania are Archean-age Kyrvoirog-type iron ores in Dobogrea or others from the Paleozoic, situate in the Carpathians. Precambrian rocks also contain polymettalic copper, zinc and lead ores, gold from metamorphic rocks. Gold-silver deposited hydrothermally in the Neogene, while porphyry copper formed through the Paleocene in calc-alkaline arc of the South Carpathians and Apuseni Mountains. Romania has oil and gas in Moesian and Scythian platform cover, coal in Carboniferous, Jurassic, Miocene and Pliocene basins, Miocene salt deposits in the Transylvanian Depression and Carpathians, Lower Jurassic kaolin in the Apuseni Mountains, Jurassic marble, Neogen alabaster and Oligocene-age amber. History of geological research Geological research focused on Romania began in the early 19th century and expanded in the second half of the century led by Austrian and Hungarian geologists. L. Mrazec and I. Popescu-Voitesti wrote the first description of Carpathian structural geology in 1905. The Geological Institute of Romania was founded in 1906. In an effort to expand mining and petroleum extraction, a full mapping of the country was completed by 1958.

The tablets were released on November 7, 2018 and are only available in silver and space gray. It is notably the thinnest iPad ever at a thickness of 5.9mm. Reception The third-generation iPad Pro models were praised for their better displays, slimmed bezels, the addition of Face ID and general speed as well as CPU improvements. Ben Sin from Forbes noted that although the screen is still an LCD screen, the 120 Hz refresh rate makes it feel more smooth. The switch to USB-C connectors received mixed reviews; external monitor support and device charging were added at the cost of extra dongles to use older cables and headphones. Some reviewers noted that although the hardware updates are great steps forward, iOS's limitations, including the lack of external storage capabilities, prevents the third generation from competing against computers. Its high prices were also criticized. iPadOS addresses the lack of external storage on supported iPads by adding support for external storage.

Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History Most of Slovakia is situated within the West Carpathian orogenic belt, except for the east of the country which is in the East Carpathians. The Transdanubian Mid-Mountain Range occupies a small area in the south, forming the basement rocks of the Danube Basin. The Eastern Alps- Western Carpathian boundary runs through Slovakia. Outer Western Carpathians Marl from the Pieniny Klippen Belt at Horné Srnie quarry *Carpathian Foredeep: Foredeeps formed during the Hercynian orogeny, filled with sedimentary rocks from the Carboniferous through the Oligocene. A Miocene-age nappe, made up of folded Cretaceous and Paleogene sedimentary rocks, known as the Flysch Belt covers most of the foredeep. *Pieniny Klippen Belt: A narrow 15 kilometer wide highly compressed zone with layers of Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous limestone \\"klippen\\" surrounded by more plastic Cretaceous marl. The belt records signs of oblique collision in the Albian, subduction and separation of crystalline rock, nappe stacking in the Campanian and subduction of the Pieniny exotic ridge in the Senonian. Gemer Belt *Gemericum: Cambrian or Ordovician through Triassic age phyllite, metaquartzite, lydite (black chert) and crystalline limestone partly replaced with siderite belonging to the Gelnica and Radovec Group, five to 10 kilometers thick in the Spissko-gemerske rudoharie Mountains. Also contains marine rocks from the Carboniferous and Permian volcanic rocks. *Meliata Unit: Permian gypsum, Triassic limestone and basic volcanites and Jurassic olistrosomes—sedimentation in a trough with a basement of oceanic crust. This unit shows through as \\"windows\\" within the Silica Nappe. *Borka Nappe: A narrow belt between Slovak Karst and Gemericum with glaucophanitized basic volcanites from the Triassic. *Rudabanyaicum: Slightly metamorphosed small Triassic nappe units extending into Slovakia from Hungary. *Silica Nappe: A large nappe, with 1.2 kilometer thick Triassic Wetterstein Limestone. The karst plain of the Slovak Karst are formed within the Silica Nappe. It did originally include Jurassic rocks, but these have mostly eroded away. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Neogene andesite from Krupina In the Paleogene, at the beginning of the Cenozoic, a marine transgression flooded the region from the vicinity of the Flysch Belt into the area of the Central West Carpathians. Paleogene sediments are found in the Orava, Liptov, Spiš, Zilina and Podhale depressions. In the Peri Klippen Zone, sedimentation began in the Paleocene, such as the Kambühel Limestone. Conglomerate is common as the bottom strata, overlain by flysch. At the edge of the subducting Flysch Belt, sedimentary rocks are up to four kilometers thick. Central Carpathian rocks are not folded. Molasse deposits laid down in the Oligocene span into southern Slovakia from the Pannonian Basin in Hungary. The back-arc molasse formed several large basins, including the Vienna Basin, Danube Basin, South Slovak Basin and East Slovak Basin in the Neogene (the Danuba, South Slovak and East Slovak are all subdivisions of the Pannonian Basin). The basins are filled with the sediments associated with the Paratethys Ocean, up to five kilometers thick. Marl is particularly common, intercalated with sandstone, tuff, conglomerate and algal limestone. Sediments became brackish over time as the Paratethys was isolated from the rest of the world's oceans. Overall, the basins are split up by numerous faults and small grabens, such as the Turiec Basin, Ziar Basin and Orava Basin filled with lake sediments. There was limited volcanic activity in the Cenozoic, including a swarm of andesite dikes in the Outer Carpathians. Geophysical research and boreholes have shed light buried volcanic rocks in the southwest Danube Basin and volcanic rocks are found throughout the Central Western Carpathians and eastern Slovakia. Peat, eolian wind-blown sands, fluvial sand and gravel and loess are all typical Quaternary sediments, formed in the past 2.5 million years old and dominating the surface of Slovak lowlands. The Váh River has up to seven terraces of sand and gravel. Travertine is also common, including travertine which preserved a cranial mold of a Neanderthal from Gánovce. Moraine formations remain in the high mountains from the Pleistocene glaciations. Natural resource geology The moderately metamorphosed Spišsko-gemerské rudohorie hosts veins of siderite, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite along with the Veitsch-type magnesite, and the Kremnica-Štiavnica Mountains have polymettalic lead, zinc, copper, gold and silver veins. Permian rocks often hold uranium ore. Halite is found in the Neogene East Slovak Basin and brown coal is extracted from both the Handlová-Nováky Basin and the Modrý Kameň-Potor Basin. There are small deposits of natural gas and oil in the Neogene strata of the Vienna Basin together with older Triassic rocks.

In 1929 she married Telecommunication officer Ioan Titu Băjenescu. He, being quite interested by radio technology, produced, in collaboration with dr. Alexandru Savopol of Craiova, the first Romanian amateur radio show on short waves on September 26, 1926. Together, they built the first short-wave transmission-reception radio station in Romania and laid the foundations of the CV5 radio club of Craiova in 1928. Lelia Băjenescu was intrigued by her husband's radio activities. With her solid education, ability able to speak German and French fluently, and well rounded culture, she quickly joined him. She learned the radio essentials and Morse alphabet by participating in the construction and commissioning of radio transmitter-receivers and mastered all of the key aspects of amateur radio. Soon she became the first female amateur radio operator of Romania, using her husband's call-sign, CV5BI. She contacted other radio amateurs from all over Europe and even Africa from 1931 to 1933. She gave birth to Titu- Marius on the 2nd of April, 1933. He would later speak about his parents in an interview and an extended CV as the intro to his life's story.

The Literary Voyager, also known as The Muzzeniegun (Ojibwe for ‘book’, also spelled Muzzinyegun) was a manuscript magazine produced by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft between December of 1826 and April of 1827, for a total of 16 issues. It is recognized as the first magazine published in Michigan, as well as the first periodical pertaining to Native American culture and mythology. The magazine contained mainly Ojibwe legends and history, as well as poems and stories written by Schoolcraft’s wife, Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, an Ojibwe woman who is now recognized as the first Native American literary writer.  Contents  The majority of the articles in the Voyager are anthropological in nature, and were written by Schoolcraft himself. Schoolcraft, an ethnologist who specialized in Native American culture, gathered most of the information necessary for the magazine from visiting Native American informants while he was working as the Indian Agent in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Another significant source of information was Jane Schoolcraft's family, who immersed him in Ojibwe culture and assisted in his learning of the language. Schoolcraft included Ojibwe folklore and history, as well as biographies of prominent tribe members and essays attempting to ascertain the \\"character of the Indian mind\\" and catalog the differences between Native American and Western culture. Frequently, he wrote articles under a pseudonym, such as Abieca, Alalcol, Clio, and Ekiega. The essays published in the Voyager became the basis for his later reports on Native American life, such as his Algic Researches, which compiled northern Native American folktales and histories. Members of Jane Schoolcraft's family also assisted in writing the magazine. John Johnston, Jane's father, is presumed to have contributed some articles under the pseudonym 'Hibernicus'. In addition, numerous contributions were made by Jane herself, under the pseudonyms 'Rosa' and 'Leelinau'. Both names presented a different facet of Schoolcraft's Native identity. 'Rosa' expressed the more virtuous and dignified side of the Ojibwe, and the poems under this name often referenced the natural world, such as the poem \\"To Sisters on a Walk in the Garden, After a Shower\\": > Come, sisters come! the shower's past, The garden walks are drying fast, The > Sun's bright beams are seen again, And nought within, can now detain. 'Leelinau', meanwhile, explored Ojibwe traditions and culture more in depth, such as in the folktale 'Moowis', in which a man scorned by his love interest builds a homunculus out of dirt and human feces and brings it to life in order to trick the woman into falling in love with it. Another example is one of Schoolcraft's more well-known stories, 'The Forsaken Brother'. In it, three children agree to their father's dying wish to take care of each other after his death. The two older children eventually forgo the agreement and abandon the youngest sibling, who is adopted by a wolf pack and eventually turns into a wolf. Many of Schoolcraft's works from the Voyager were later edited and published; Henry Schoolcraft reprinted several of her stories in his Algic Researches, as well as another of his magazines, called Oneota. Her works are also featured in several literary anthologies and have been published as a stand-alone collection.  Publication History  The Literary Voyager was Schoolcraft's second manuscript magazine, preceded by The Cricket, which ran under various names from 1809 to 1818, and followed by The Bow and Arrow, which began in 1833 and ran for an unknown length of time. The Voyager was published weekly between December of 1826 and April of 1827, the last known issue dated April 28th. The magazine had a limited audience, as only a few copies were produced of each issue. It was mainly circulated among Schoolcraft's acquaintances in Sault Ste. Marie, but, over time was sent to Detroit and New York as well. Schoolcraft planned to publish the entire run of the magazine in book form in the 1850s; however, the project was abandoned, and the manuscripts were not formally published until 1962. This collection, released by the Michigan State University Press, did not include issues 6, 10, and most of 12, as these issues were lost when Schoolcraft's manuscripts were transferred to the Library of Congress.

Short songs (\\"ditties\\") and poems often joked about terrible conditions, fear of death, and general cynicism on the perceived hopelessness and pointlessness of the war. The journal of the 55th West Lancashire Division, Sub Rosa, included this poem in 1917: > Little Jack Wrench Sat down in a trench With a 'pork and beans' and some > bread, When an Allemande shell On the parapet fell So he got 'iron rations' > instead.  Publication and distribution  Most journals were manufactured at or near the front lines of the trenches. However, there were many different methods of manufacture, copying, and distribution. For example, some journals were physically printed away from the trenches in England, while some used abandoned printing presses found in old printeries. In terms of duplication, materials such as carbon paper, typewriters, and stencils were used, contributing to the informal and handmade appearance of the magazines. Before publication, trench journals — like any writing done by a soldier intended to be sent out — went through censorship. In the very first edition of The Wipers Times, an editorial in the beginning reads: \\"the shadow of censorship enveloping us causes us to refer to the war...in a cautious manner\\". It was for this reason, also, that the authors of the magazines were often given pseudonyms; their real names never disclosed. While the journals were first and foremost written for other soldiers to read, some publications were distributed elsewhere. In his book The Soldiers' Press, Graham Seal states that \\"[the soldiers] conveyed beyond their primary readership ... a carefully constructed version of [their] experience to those back home.\\"  Notable publications  A very well-known trench magazine in the 21st century is the Wipers Times, the periodical of the British Sherwood Foresters. It was manufactured in the city of Ypres, Belgium (the name of which gave rise to the title of the magazine, since \\"Ypres\\" was often pronounced \\"Wipers\\" by the British soldiers). This particular magazine is representative of the overall cadence of trench literature, being cynical, yet satirical and lighthearted. In the fourth edition of the Wipers Times (also called The \\"New Church\\" Times), a satirical essay entitled \\"The Lecture\\" begins as follows: > If at any time you happen to be at all depressed—though of course this is > extremely unlikely out here where there is so much to interest and delight > one—find out whether there is a lecture on anywhere, given by the G.S.O. > first or second of a Division about to be relieved, to the officers of the > relieving Division, and go to it at once. It will make you realise that war > is worth while. Although hundreds of trench journals existed, the Wipers Times is one of the most widely known and remembered. It has inspired multiple forms of media in the modern day, including the 2013 movie of the same name, the 2006 book by Ian Hislop, and the 2016 play by Hislop and Nick Newman.

The district covers portions of five counties, and includes many of Chicago's western suburbs, such as Wheaton, Palatine, and Barrington. Education Born in Dublin, Ireland,, and raised in Hartsdale, NY, Casten earned a bachelor of arts in molecular biology and biochemistry from Middlebury College in 1993, and then worked for two years as a scientist at the Tufts University School of Medicine in a laboratory investigating dietary impacts on colon and breast cancer. In 1998, he earned a Master of Engineering Management and a Master of Science in biochemical engineering from the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, he worked to develop technologies for alternative heat and power generation technologies including the production of fuel grade ethanol. Casten is a member of Thayer School of Engineering’s Corporate Collaboration Council. Early career Casten began his career working as a clean energy consultant and manager at Arthur D Little, an energy practice with a focus on clean technology. From 2000 to 2006, he served as the president and CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, which focused on utilizing energy recycling technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emission by generating heat and power from previously wasted energy. In 2006, Casten founded Recycled Energy Development (RED) and served as CEO along with his father Tom Casten, who served as Chairman. Casten moved to Illinois in 2007. RED focused on recycling wasted energy and converting energy facilities to cleaner, more economic uses. RED was a leading company in the United States in the attempt to make profitable use of waste heat capturing technology, an avenue of electricity generation that has been attracting interest from a number of startup companies looking to find a \\"breakthrough\\" in the technology, including Alphabet. The company was acquired by Ironclad Energy Partners in 2016. Civic advocacy Casten was a founding chairman of the Northeast CHP Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy organization with a mission to advance policies that favor energy efficiency in the northeast United States. He also participated in crafting the bill that became the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a program in the northeast United States that attempts to use market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For his advocacy of clean energy policies and technology, Casten was named to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs' Emerging Leaders Class of 2011. Casten has authored a number of articles on clean energy technologies and the United States electricity grid as well as energy policy and regulation. U.S. House of Representatives Casten announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in in September 2017. He defeated six other contenders in the 2018 Democratic primary to become the party's nominee against six-term incumbent Republican Peter Roskam. On November 6, 2018, Casten won the election, defeating Roskam by a margin of 7 points. Casten ran on a platform focused on climate change mitigation and political transparency; before his win, he said that his legislative goals in response to his district's main needs were to support health care access (criticizing Roskam's votes against the Affordable Care Act and against individual mandates), to work against the tax bill Roskam sponsored, and to reform student loan and bankruptcy codes. This race was viewed as one that Democrats needed to win in order to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time since the 2010 elections. Illinois's 6th congressional district supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by about 7 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. This was one of 25 GOP-held seats in the U.S. Representatives that Clinton carried in 2016; Democrats flipped 23 of them in 2018.  Tenure  Upon his swearing-in, Casten became the first Democrat to represent this district since it assumed its present configuration in 1949. The district had been numbered as the 10th from 1949 to 1967, and has been the 6th since 1967. The district is best known as the seat of former House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, who held it from 1975 until handing it to Roskam upon his retirement in 2007.

Lithuania is a country in the Baltic region of northern-eastern Europe. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The basement rock of Lithuania is made up of the West Lithuanian Granitic Massif aluminous schist, metabasic rocks (reaching granulite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies) and gneiss and the Southeast Lithuanian Zone granitoids, plagiomicrocline granite and migmatite. The massif has some notable Mesoproterozoic dike swarms. In the southeast, granitoids alternate with metagraywacke, amphibolite and rare dolomite marble, mica-schist. Metamorphic rocks typically reach amphibolite facies and ultramafic or mafic intrusions are common. An angular unconformity separates weathered basement rock from the Merkys Formation fanglomerates, formed in the Neoproterozoic. Salica Formation arkose and siltstone overlies these units, overlain in the east by the Kieva Formation with siltstone, clay and sandstone. Sedimentary rocks up to 2.3 kilometers thick define the entire Phanerozoic rock record. Paleozoic (541–251 million years ago) Dark green clay with sandstone and siltstone interbeds, together up to 40 meters thick, overlies Vendian age rocks, defining the Lower Cambrian and the start of the Paleozoic. It is overlain by the Lontova Stage clays. The Vergale Stage has an angular unconformity with basement rocks in the east and contains brown oolitic ironstone, sandstone, siltstone and argillite up to 45 meters thick with the 42 meter Rausve Stage sandstone and siltstone above it. The mid-Cambrian Kybartai Stage sits above the Rausve Stage with abundant glauconite and is overlain in the west by the 67 meters of clay in the Deimena Stage or the Paneriai Stage argillite and sandstone in the east. Ordovician rocks include numerous limestone and marl sequences in the Kunda, Aseri, Lasnamae, Uhaku, Idavere, Johvi, Keila, Rakvere, Nabala, Vormsi, Pirgu and Porkuni stages. Juuru Stage microcrystalline nodular limestone and red marl from the Silurian transgressively overlies Ordovician rocks, ascending through a sequence that includes the Raikkula, Adavere, Jaani, Jaagarahu, Siesartis, Dubysa, Pagegiai, Minija and Jura stage rocks, which include argillite, dolomite, marl, clay and other basin sediments. The early DevonianTilzee and Stoniskiai Stage rocks are disconformably overlain by the Kemeri Stage with clays and siltstones up to 170 meters thick. This is in-turn overlain disconformably by the Rezekne Stage. Other units include the Parnu, Narva, Arukula, Burtnieki, Sventoji, Dubnik, Katleski, Pamusis, Stipinai, Amula, Kruoja, Siauliai, Joniski, Kursa, Akmene, Muri, Svete, Zagare and Ketleri stages. Sandstone, siltstone and dolomitic marl of the Letiza Formation up to 20 meters thick marks the beginning of the Carboniferous, overlain by 16 meters of Paplaka Formation dolomite and 50 meters of Nica Formation sandstones, sands and siltstones. Basal conglomerates begin the Werra Stage sequence from the Permian, which ascends into siltstone, limestone, marl, gypsum and anhydrite up to 170 meters thick. The very thin (no more than eight meters) Strassfurt Stage is the final Paleozoic unit in Lithuania. Mesozoic (251–66 million years ago) The Nemunas Formation is the oldest Mesozoic formation, from the Triassic, overlying Permian, Carboniferous, Neoproterozoic and Devonian rocks with clay, argillite, marl and siltstone up to 131 meters thick. It is conformably overlain by the clay, argillite and sandstones of the Palanga Formation up to 776 meters thick, the 54 meter Taurage Formation oolitic limestones, marl and clay, and the reddish clays with sandstone-siltstone layers of the Sarkuva Formation. The Upper Triassic is marked by the Nida Formation, which lies disconformably on older Triassic rocks with 15 meters of sandstone, siltstone and clay. Basal conglomerate marks the beginning of the Lower Jurassic Neringa Formation with 33 meters of sandstone and clay, with the 45 meter siltstones, clay and sandstone of the Lave Formation. The Middle Jurassic Isrutis Formation overlies both Triassic rocks and the Lava Formation with black sands 100 meters thick. Seventy meters of the Liepona Formation calcareous sandstones and gray clays lies above both the Lava and Isrutis formations. The Papile Formation is associated with the Callovian time period and includes marl, limestone, sandstone, sands, siderite and clay. Late Jurassic Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian and Volgian rocks 68, 36 and 20 meters thick lie above these units with approximately the same sedimentary makeup. Sixteen meters of deltaic sands and siltstones known as the Uzupiai Formation mark the beginning of the Cretaceous, while 53 meters of glauconite sand in the Jiesia Formation have an angular unconformity with Jurassic and Silurian rocks. A basal phosphorite layer indicates a return to deposition after a disconformity between older Cretaceous rocks and Cenomanian sequences, which also include sand, silt, chalky marl and limestone. Chalk and chert nodules are defining sedimentary features of 48 meter Turonian, 79 meter Coniacian and 40 meter Santonian age rocks. Cenozoic (66 million years ago – present) The Liubava Formation from the Paleocene lies disconformably atop Maastrichtian age rocks and includes marl and glauconite silt 56 meters thick. It is overlain disconformably by the Eocene Alka Formation glauconite sands, silts and phosphorite up to 27 meters thick. The Prusai Formation with 10 to 12 meter thick amber, phosphorite and glauconite silts overlies both units. Carbonaceous sands with layers of silt and clay up to 18 meters thick deposited during the Miocene. There are also Pliocene beds of sand, silt and clay up to 14 meters thick and the Anyksciai Formation, made up of 10 meters of quartz sandstone, sand, silt and clay. Natural resource geology In the 1990s, 38 million cubic meters of raw materials were mined in Lithuania every year and 1.3 million cubic meters of groundwater were pumped to the surface. Chalk, limestone and dolomite are abundant and widely used for construction. Iron ore and anhydrite are known from the Precambrian basement, but have not been exploited. Cambrian and Silurian rocks hold about 100 million tons of oil. Quaternary gravel, Neogene glass-grade sand, Devonian gypsum and Paleogene amber are also extracted.

History Glengall Road on an 1885 map from the Report of the Boundary Commissioners for England and Wales Glengall Street appears on Joseph Cross's New Plan of London for 1861, but not on his previous plan of 1850. The name comes from the Richard Butler, 2nd Earl of Glengall who had married Margaret Lauretta Mellish, the daughter of William Mellish, in 1834. Magaret and her sister inherited a large amount of land on the Isle of Dogs, known as the Mellish Estate. After becoming the Countess of Glengall, the trustees of the Mellish inheritance successfully challenged the Earl of Glengall, who was declared bankrupt before dying in 1858.

Early Occupants  The first documented structure at this site appears on a 1765 map of the town. Later, a map of 1788 describes the house on this lot as a house of \\"wattle and daub in fair condition,\\" owned by Matias Pons. It remained in his possession until he died in 1817, when his will described the property as a \\"stone and wood house with a store of victuals and provisions situated on St. George Street that goes to the Land Gate [present day City Gate] with its corresponding lot.\\" The property continued in the hands of his heirs until Peter Benet purchased it in 1839.  The Benet Family  Peter Benet and his wife, Juana Hernández, had ten children, among whom was Joseph Ravina Benet who later assisted in store operations. Peter Benet's application for leave to remove his retail liquor shop from the southeast (the Benet House) to the southwest corner of St. George and Cuna Streets is recorded in the City Council Minute Book of October 13, 1840. Before Peter Benet purchased 62 St. George Street from the Pons heirs, Benet operated his own store on the ground floor of his own house across the street, as evidenced through taxes he paid on stock at $16 per year for shop licenses. After Peter Benet died in 1870, his son Joseph Ravina Benet held occupational licenses from 1871-1883 on the house. The licenses were usually listed for keeping a store, or for selling goods, wares, and merchandise. In 1872 Joseph Ravina Benet was able to procure a license to sell wine and malt liquors, and in 1882-1883 he was able to sell tobacco and cigars. The general store remained in existence until the late 19th century, when a notice in an 1887 newspaper appeared ordering the sale of Peter Benet's property. The name Benet later became widely known in literary circles because of the works of Stephen Vincent Benet, a famous poet. Stephen Vincent Benet was the great-grandson of Peter Benet and the grandson of Brigadier General Stephen Vincent Benet, distinguished West Point graduate. The old Benet store was demolished on August 13, 1903, before Bernard A. Masters built a new building on the site.  San Agustín Antiguo  In 1967, the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board began reconstructing a building on the old foundations of the old Benet store using early photographs, historic research, and recollections of two surviving members of the Benet family. During the era of San Agustín Antiguo, a living history museum running the length of St. George Street, the Benet store was on display as a craft store and museum. It was reconstructed as a 19th century general store; sausage stuffers, a cabbage shredder, an auger, hand wrought shears, and tongs hung from the ceiling. There were barrels of food throughout the store and announcements for ship arrivals into the port of St. Augustine lined the walls.  Present Day  Today, the Benet store is retail space occupied by a jewelry store called J. R. Benet. The company, founded in 1979, makes handcrafted jewelry and gifts.

Early life  Helen Katherine Hoy was born in Albany, New York in 1878. Her father Charles T. Hoy worked in prisons, advocated for improved sanitary conditions in prisons, and also founded libraries. Her mother Lucy M.S. Hoy graduated from Albany Normal School and worked as a public school assistant principal. Helen Hoy attended Albany High School and then Vassar, graduating in 1899 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. After graduation she worked for three years as a teacher of Greek and English at private schools in New Jersey and New York, and East Side Evening High School for Women (New York City), before pursuing a career in law. Hoy married attorney Harold D. Greeley on August 29, 1908.  Legal career  Hoy earned a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from New York University, graduating in 1903 at the head of her class, and was admitted to the New York Bar that same year. Along with Sarah E. Martin, she engaged in general legal practice at the firm of Hoy and Martin. In addition to general legal practice, she was one of the legal representatives of the New York Charter Revision Commission, and represented the Interborough Association of Women Teachers, the New York Committee for a State Police, and several suffrage organizations. Among her many accomplishments she drafted the law that created the New York Department of State Police, the law providing military rank to army nurses, and the regulations in Missouri that regulated nursing practice.  Suffrage  Helen Hoy Greeley is third from the right in the front row, a representative of the National Women's party posing with Senator Harding, 1920. In January 1907, Harriot Stanton Blatch founded the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women, emphasizing a militant, aggressive form of activism in support of women's enfranchisement. Helen Hoy was an early member of this organization that sought membership from professional women like Hoy in addition to large numbers of unionized and working class women. By 1908 the League's membership included Hoy, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Florence Kelley, Leonora O'Reilly, Lavinia Dock, Jessie Ashley, Gertrud Barnum, Inez Milholland, and Rose Schneiderman. After the sixtieth anniversary celebration of the Seneca Falls Convention, Hoy joined a \\"trolley car campaign\\" organized by Blatch and Maud Malone, traveling throughout New York and ending near Vassar College. Led by Milholland, several members of the League including Hoy, Blatch, Gilman and Schneiderman participated in what would become an infamous pro-suffrage gathering of Vassar students at a cemetery near the campus, as the campus president had forbidden suffrage gatherings on school grounds. Over her activist career, Helen was also a founding member of the College Equal Suffrage League of New York and the Original Woman Suffrage Party. She held leadership roles in the Nineteenth Assembly District, Borough of Brooklyn and Borough of Manhattan Woman Suffrage Parties, and served on committees of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Hoy marched in the first New York suffrage parade, and is credited with beginning the practice of \\"intensive district street speaking, demonstrating its effectiveness by speaking 56 consecutive nights on one street corner, Ninety-sixth Street and Broadway\\" In 1911 Greeley traveled throughout Sonoma, San Francisco and much of southeast California to help convince voters in previously anti-suffrage areas to support California suffrage] Greeley joined Gail Laughlin, Maud Younger, Jeannette Rankin, Margaret Haley, Alma Lafferty and other politicians and labor and suffrage activists from across the country to support the efforts in Northern California. Among her arguments for women's enfranchisement was a reminder that over 8,500 women were teachers in California, but they were unable to vote for the position of County Superintendent of Schools. In the final days of the California campaign, Greeley is credited with keeping an outdoor audience of 4,000 in good humor, while 6,000 others attended a mass meeting inside the Dreamland Rink. After women successfully won the vote in 1911, Greeley returned to California in 1912 in support of Senator La-Follette's presidential campaign. In 1912 Greeley and Charlotte Anita Whitney of California provided support to Portland area suffrage groups, providing lectures in homes, at the Woman's Press club, and a meeting of the Portland Woman's Club Campaign Committee. As part of this visit Whitney and Greeley helped to found a Portland chapter of the College Equal Suffrage League. Greeley engaged in frequent presentations to gatherings of the Portland Equal Suffrage League, especially challenging President Roosevelt's statements and views on woman suffrage and his claims that women were not serious about the movement In 1913 Greeley created the \\"Rainbow Campaign,\\" as suffragists promoting the 1915 state vote distributed five different colored flyers to homes in New York. Although this particular campaign ultimately failed, the strategy demonstrated Greeley's creativity in obtaining attention for the cause. While she was viewed as strategic and creative, she didn't take lightly the cause she was supporting. In May 1915 the Hudson Evening Register is reported as indicating \\"Helen Hoy Greeley 'urged the men not to vote ‘yes’ because some pretty woman had requested them to do so, but to consider carefully the arguments of both suffragists and anti-suffragists and vote according to their honest convictions.’\\" In 1914 Greeley's speaking tour took her to Dover, Delaware, serving as a keynote speaker at the annual state suffrage convention.  Rank for nurses  From 1918-1920, Greeley focused her attention on obtaining rank for army nurses, arguing that this was a matter or women's dignity. Along with Harriot Stanton Blatch, Greeley organized the National Committee to Secure Rank for Army Nurses, with Blatch serving as chair of the New York section and Greeley as general secretary and legal counsel. The organization's aim was to ensure that all military nurses of any rank would be recognized as officers. In June 1918, Greeley is reported to have stated, “Under existing conditions the army nurse, trained by three years’ study and experience, has less authority on her own job than the hospital orderly of three weeks, training and less experience. Handicapped and delayed in their work by lack of authority… the army nurses here and abroad are backing a movement to obtain relative military rank.” She insisted the urgency was based on both hospital morale, respect, and efficiency of job performance (The Evening Independent June 20, 1918)” Over time, viewed as a peer to M. Adelaide Nutting, Frances Payne Bolton and Annie W. Goodrich, Greeley was regarded as one of the most prominent activists seeking greater recognition and respect for the work of army nurses. Greeley challenged military officers and medical professionals of all sexes who claimed women neither needed nor benefited from obtaining military rank because civility prevented women from being mistreated by their male colleagues. She believed women needed to get out from under \\"the spell\\" of those who had convinced nurses they didn't deserve rank. On June 4, 1920 President Wilson signed into law the official army reorganization that provided nurses with military rank and the same social rights and privileges of other officers, but did not confer them with equal pay.  Other activism  Greeley's civic engagement in New York included leadership in the City Improvement Society, the Committee of Fifty for the Removing of the Eleventh Avenue railroad tracks, and the Women's Municipal League. Her activism related to peace and justice included word addressing amnesty for political prisoners and the need for disarmament, and activist and legal service to the NY Council for the Limitation of Armaments, the Women's Committee for World Disarmament, the Legislative Committee for the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom, and the Institute of Politics at Williams College. After woman suffrage was obtained, Greeley moved to Milwaukee, and joined Wisconsin bar. In the late 1920s and early 1930s she served as Secretary of the Milwaukee County Branch of the League of Nations, especially addressing issues of disarmament. She retired in the 1940s as senior solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior.”  Publications  Greeley, H. H. (1898). The Life and Legal Influence of David Dudley Field. Greeley, H. H. (1919).

Latvia is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Several hundred boreholes have returned data about the Precambrian crystalline basement of Latvia, indicating young Middle Proterozoic intrusive rocks such as 1.65 billion year old rapakivi granite or 1.82 billion year old granodiorite in the northeast. Most basement probably formed before the Svecofennian orogeny, between the Archean and Proterozoic. The Valmiera-Lokno Rise has early Archean amphibolite, gneiss, granitoid and migmatite under the east of Latvia, although metavolcanics, granulite gneiss and magnetite-bearing quartzite are most common in the Riga Megablock. The Garsene-Limbazi megablock has steeply dipping amphibolite, epidote amphibolite, plagiogneiss, migmatite granite, magnetite-rich quartzite (in the south) from the Proterozoic. Low-grade metavolcanics and 1.8 billion year old granodiorites cover the Riga Megablock in the Adazi assemblage. The Riga Pluton (or Kurzeme Pluton) is a large intrusion from 1.65 billion years ago with gabbro, anorthosite and rapakivi granite, covered in unmetamorphosed Pavilosta Formation volcanics along the west coast. Mesoproterozoic rocks are separated from the Neoproterozoic by an erosion horizon. In western Latvia, basalt, gabbro-norite dikes, tuff, sand and gravel (sediments in the Zuru beds), limburgite and basaltic picrate are particularly common. The Valdai Group holds extensive siltstone, sandstone and clay from the Neoproterozoic. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Cambrian rocks trace the Precambrian subsurface and the oldest, 50 to 130 meters thick are found in the east, including shale, argillite and sandstone. Fossil evidence indicates they correlate with the Cambrian Blue Shale in Estonia, early and middle Cambrian rocks in the west are about 220 meters thick. Upper parts of the lower section have brown oolite iron ore in argillite with a thickness of up to five meters and some rocks in the west host small amounts of oil. Except in the north- center of the country, Ordovician rocks are everywhere in the subsurface and include argillite, shale and limestone about 250 meters thick at an average depth of 1.7 kilometers below sea level. A disconformity separates Silurian rocks from Ordovician rocks and they are common in the subsurface, about 950 meters deep in the west or 162 meters in the north. Most are carbonate rocks with 23 different known graptolite zones. Since the late 19th century, researchers have often focused on widespread Devonian rocks up to 900 meters thick that often directly underlie Quaternary deposits and outcrop along streams. Early Devonian rocks are 250 meters thick including siltstone, shale, sandstone, clay and ostracoderm fossils. Middle Devonian rocks have a shift toward argillite and gypsum and gypsum is quarried in Salaspils-Sauriesli between Ogre and Riga. Famenninan Stage dolomite and siltstone is up to 140 meters thick, overlain by Frasnian dolomite, quarried in the east for us ceramics. Carboniferous rocks are limited to the southwest, with Tournasian age dolomitic sandstone, dolomite, sandstone and siltstone 104 meters thick. Permian rocks are also confined to the southwest, with a significant disconformity from underlying Carboniferous rocks. Permian rocks from the Kazanian are 35 meters thick with carbonate shale, dolomite, limestone and sandstone. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Only small areas in the southwest have Triassic rocks, including 74 meters of carbonate clays, sandstone and siltstone. Jurassic rocks are also confined to the southwest and are thinner at only 27 meters and include clay, quartz sands, sandstone, lignite, and siltstone with foraminifera fossils. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Cenozoic units are largely absent in Latvia, except from the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, which cover the entire country, except where wave erosion has stripped them away on the east-central shore of the Gulf of Riga (or in some river valleys). In buried valleys, these sediments can be up to 310 meters thick, although the average thickness is up to 20 meters in lowlands 40 to 60 meters in highlands. Between Cesis and Madona and in the Vidzeme Highland in south-central part of the country, thicknesses can reach up to 200 meters. The Latgale Formation includes Precambrian crystalline clasts and gray clay left over from the first Pleistocene glaciation. Zidini Formation interglacial lakebed sediments overlie the Latgale up to 23.5 meters thick. The overlying Letiza Formation correlates with formations such as the Oka in Russia or Sangaste in Estonia, associated with the Elsterian glaciation and includes till atop Jurassic rock. Eight meters of lacustrine sediment in the Pulvernieki or marine clays in the Akmenrags Formation line up with the mid-Pleistocene Holsteinian glaciation. Along the Baltic coast, up to 60 meters of brackish sand—the Jurkalne Member—overlies the Akmenrags Formation. The Kurzeme Formation gray calcareous material is widespread, left from the most extensive period of glaciation. The last interglacial is marked by the Felicianova Formation alluvium, overlain by Baltic group sediments from the last glacial advance. Glacial retreat and oscillation took place from 25,000 to 12,000 years ago, leaving the 90 meter Latvia Formation, including the Jelgava Member lacustrine deposits. Major spillways drained the landscape, emptying the Baltic Ice Lake which flooded much of the region. The Yoldia Sea, Ancillus Lake, Littorina Sea and Limnea Sea all existed during the early Holocene, leaving behind shoreline deposits.

It works mostly with airlines to develop travel software, such as booking websites, and counts Air China and JetBlue among its customers. It is quoted on the Dublin ISEQ.  History  A precursor to Datalex was Channel Communication Services (CCS), a company started by Scottish businessman Neil Wilson in 1983. In 1984, IDA Ireland asked Wilson if he would set up an Irish office in Dublin. The next year, Wilson sold his stake in CCS and founded Datalex with IDA grants. To begin with, Datalex produced check-in and reservations technology but the decline of the airline industry in the late 1980s focused the company on global distribution systems. At first, the company sold services to larger pre-existing global distribution companies, such as Sabre and Sita but by 1998, Datalex had grown to be major firm of the travel industry in its own right. At that time, an estimated one-sixth of the world's travel agents used Datalex technology in day-to-day bookings and reservations. The next year, Datalex floated itself on the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges and raised $30 million in private funds. In 2012, Aidan Brogan took over as CEO after Cormac Whelan stepped down, aiming to stem the annual losses that Datalex had been suffering for several years. By 2013, Datalex had produced an annual profit of $1.1m and the next year, announced its first shareholder dividend in the company's 29-year history. Datalex opened a new office in Beijing in 2014 in an effort to access the growth of the Chinese market. 2017 saw an increased net profit of $7.1m and revenue of $63.9m due to new contracts with international deals with Chinese and European airlines. On the British exit from the EU, Brogan commented that as the company was \\"geographically spread\\", it had \\"in-built resilience\\" to \\"local issues such as Brexit\\". He stated that the company's Manchester office, where around 40 people are employed, would stay open but also noted that the Brexit negotiations were \\"not helpful for anybody\\". In September 2018, Datalex's CFO, David Kennedy announced he would step down at the end of the year, ending an 11-year stint at the company. The next month, Datalex signed a deal with Scandinavian Airlines to improve the airline's digital strategy. In October 2019 it was announced that Interim CEO Sean Corkery had been appointed CEO in a full-time capacity. Revenue irregularities On 15 January 2019, Datalex issued a shock profit warning revealing it had misstated revenues in relation to a major customer (thought to be Lufthansa) in the first half of the previous year. Datalex warned that it expected to report an adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) loss of between $1m (€870,000) and $4m (€3.5m), compared with the consensus view among analyst for an almost $16m profit (€14.1m). This represents a difference of as much as $20m (€17.6m) and would result in the company making a loss for 2018. As a result of the announcement, Datalex's share price slumped by 59% the same day, its market value dropping from €191m to €78m. The profit alert came only eight weeks after Datalex issued a positive trading update, saying it had been performing in line with expectations up to 23 November 2018 and that it was “confident” about delivering double-digit percentage EBITDA growth for the full year. On 6 February 2019, Ireland's Central Bank opened an investigation into the company's November trading statement after Datalex appointed auditors PwC to review a possible accounting issue. After the announcement, shares in the company dropped by 1%. On 14 February 2019, Datalex announced it planned to cut jobs from its workforce of 500 people (including staff and consultants) in an effort to save up to $10m (€8.8m) a year in costs. The company announcement did not specify to how many people would be let go. On 19 February 2019, Datalex announced that its new CFO, Dónal Rooney (who joined the company in December 2018), was reported to be stepping down from the company board but remaining with the company until April to assist with the transition to the next CFO and to help advance a number of \\"critical ongoing organisational projects\\". In April 2019, company Chairman Paschal Taggart announced he would resign after the company's AGM later in the year. He said he would have liked to have done a \\"far better job\\" and that \\"somebody had to fall on their sword in these situations\\". The same month, the Irish Times reported that CEO Aidan Brogan had threatened the company's chairman with legal proceedings after the profit warning in January and told him to limit his contact with clients and employees. Datalex's shares were suspended on the 1st May after the company missed a regulatory deadline to publish its full- year results. Datalex's share price closed at €0.916 on the Euronext ISEQ on April 30 and were not traded the next day. As of August 2019, Datalex shares have stayed suspended and will remain so until the company's accounts are made public, complying with market transparency rules. On 3 May 2019, Brogan resigned with immediate effect with Sean Corkery taking up the role of acting CEO. On 14 May, former Google executive Niall O'Sullivan was announced to be the firm's new CFO, replacing Dónal Rooney. On 16 May, the Irish Times reported that Datalex had been in takeover talks with an unnamed software firm before the issuing of the profit warning. On 2 August 2019, the company said it expected to report a loss between $4–6 million for 2018 and to also suspend its profit guidance for 2019 and 2020 until the end of the review of its accounts. Seán Corkery said he and Niall O'Sullivan would review the firm's “investment in product development and expect to report a significant exceptional cost” in the accounts for 2018. The Irish Times also reported that billionaire Dermot Desmond had injected €10m in the company to keep it afloat. On 6 September 2019, Datalex reported a $50 million loss for 2018 though auditor EY declined to give an opinion on the company's finances. The next day Lufthansa announced it had ended its contract with Datalex. The firm said they would challenge the legality of the termination notice. At Datalex's AGM in mid-September, acting-CEO Sean Corkery said that former management had misled the board and suggested that legal action might be taken against them to recover $3.8 million that had been wrongly used to fund shareholder dividends. It was also reported by the Irish Times that Cyril McGuire, a technology entrepreneur, and Michael Chadwick, a former director of Grafton, had also put money into Datalex.

The street runs north–south along the west side of Lake Union for from McGraw Square to the Fremont Bridge. The street's unusual route through the Denny Triangle follows a former railroad grade through a narrow valley between two hills that were regraded in the early 20th century. Westlake Boulevard was constructed through the valley in 1906, following the railroad and a streetcar line, and was later renamed to Westlake Avenue. The street was modified to run northbound-only from Denny Way to Mercer Street in the mid-20th century and remained one-way until 2007. Westlake Avenue is also served by a variety of public transit routes, including the South Lake Union Streetcar and RapidRide C Line. In 2016, a section of the street in South Lake Union received transit-only lanes in March 2016 and a cycletrack was installed along the west side of Lake Union. A Link light rail station is planned to be built at Westlake and Denny Way when a planned extension to Ballard is completed in 2035. Street description Westlake Avenue begins at Stewart Street on the north side of McGraw Square, which also serves as the southern terminus of the South Lake Union Streetcar. The square is located adjacent to the Times Square Building and one block north of the Westlake Center and Nordstrom Building. The southernmost block of Westlake Avenue is divided between the streetcar tracks and a southbound-only street that connects to a porte-cochère for the Westin Seattle hotel complex. Westlake gains a northbound lane after crossing 6th Avenue and continues northwest across the Denny Triangle street grid, forming several triangular blocks. The street passes the east side of the Amazon headquarters campus, including Doppler and the Amazon Spheres, and several high-rise residential buildings. A set of curbside transit-only lanes begin at Virginia Street and include several streetcar stops that are shared with buses. Westlake Avenue turns due north at an intersection with Denny Way, which marks the boundary of South Lake Union. The street continues north through the South Lake Union neighborhood, passing through an office and commercial district with several tech company offices. After crossing Mercer Street at the north end of the neighborhood, the transit-only lanes end and the streetcar's southbound track turns east onto Valley Street near the Allen Institute for Brain Science Building and future Google campus. Westlake Avenue turns northwest to follow the shore of Lake Union near Lake Union Park and the Museum of History and Industry. The east side of the street is used as a parking lot with a protected cycletrack and walking trail that runs along the side of the lake and its marinas. The street continues north through the Westlake neighborhood, parallel to Aurora and Dexter avenues to the west, and crosses under a pedestrian suspension bridge at Galer Street. Westlake gradually turns northwest along the side of a greenbelt and crosses under the Aurora Bridge before terminating at an intersection with Dexter Avenue, Nickerson Street, and Fremont Avenue on the south side of the Fremont Bridge. Nickerson travels west along the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the Seattle Pacific University campus in northern Queen Anne, while Fremont Avenue crosses the bridge into Fremont and continues north to Woodland Park Zoo. History Looking at the intersection of Westlake Avenue and 4th Avenue in 1909 A military road was built along the west side of Lake Union in the early 1860s to connect the lake to the modern settlement of Seattle, following the general path of an older trail used by Native Americans. Lake Union became a landing point for coal shipments that were hauled by boat and wagon from modern-day Newcastle and Renton and were bound for ships on Elliott Bay. A narrow gauge railroad was constructed in 1872 through the valley on the east side of Denny Hill, following the modern- day route of Westlake Avenue. The railroad was abandoned five years later and replaced in 1890 with a streetcar line that was built in less than a week by the Seattle Electric Railway and Power Company. Between Depot Street (now Denny Way) and the southern shore of Lake Union, the streetcar followed Rollin Avenue. The street was constructed in 1907 and completed in November of that year. Transit service Westlake Avenue is served by the South Lake Union Streetcar, which began operating in 2007, and several bus routes run by King County Metro. Following the addition of transit-only lanes in March 2016, the RapidRide C Line and Metro Route 40 were moved onto the Westlake Avenue corridor. The C Line connects South Lake Union to West Seattle, while Route 40 continues north on Westlake from Downtown Seattle to Fremont, Ballard, and Northgate. Sound Transit plans to build two light rail stations in the general vicinity of Westlake Avenue in the Denny Triangle area. The Ballard Link Extension, planned to open in 2035, will include a station at the intersection of Westlake and Denny Way, along with an auxiliary South Lake Union station on Republican Street and an auxiliary Denny Triangle station on 6th Avenue near the current Westlake station. Cycling The Westlake cycletrack, connecting Lake Union Park to the Fremont Bridge, opened in September 2016. The cycletrack project cost $3.6 million to construct and came after several years of public meetings and negotiations with business owners over the potential loss of public parking spaces. People for Bikes, a bicycle advocacy group, named the Westlake cycletrack the \\"best new bike lane\\" of 2016 for the United States. The southern reaches of Westlake have been criticized by cyclists due to the presence of streetcar tracks that pose a danger to thinner bicycle tires.

The project has the approval of the Ethiopian Culture Ministry and a strong commitment to developing Ethiopian archaeology, paleontology and geology research infrastructure. This project has discovered over 260 fossil specimens and over 17,000 vertebrate fossil specimens to date ranging from 200,000 to 6,000,000 years in age. Researchers have discovered the remains of four hominin species, the earliest subspecies of homo sapiens as well as stone tools. All specimens are permanently held at the National Museum of Ethiopia, where the project’s laboratory work is conducted year round.  Geography  The Afar Region of Ethiopia The Middle Awash Project takes place in a semi arid, rather remote part of the Afar rift. Between 5.8 and 4.4 Ma, the region was grassland and wetland. Today, the rift is a basin divided by fault lines and filled with volcanoes. Also called the Afar Depression, it has long been inhabited by the nomadic Afar people of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Plateau lies to the west of the depression, the Danakil block to the northeast, the Ali- Sabieh block to the southeast, and the Somalian Plateau to the south. The study area is bounded in the south by Gewane town and the Arso River and the north end touches the Talalak River. The rift margin marks the western end of the study area, while the Gewane-Adaitu highway lies on its east. Middle Awash is much larger than other nearby sites, such as Olduvai Gorge and Hadar. This is because the fossil potential is spaced out across the area. In fact, not even a quarter of the area contains any possibility of bearing fruit. Fossils found in the Middle Awash are located in small, scattered windows. Therefore, the fossil record is more fragmented as opposed to a continuous view of the past. To accurately date fossils and artifacts, researchers use “geology and structural, geomorphological, sedimentological, volcanological, paleomagnetic, tephrochemical, isotopic, and radiometric dating studies.”  Project history  Jon Kalb The recognition of Middle Awash as a site of value to the field of paleontology was a gradual process. Some sources say that the first European exploration was led by a British mining engineer. Since he failed to see anything of note in the area, there is less of a record of this. In 1938 two Italian geologists Michele Gortani and Angelo Bianchi, conducted a geological survey of the area. The Italians also did not see anything of potential importance in their survey. The first European to take paleontological interest in Middle Awash was a French professor named Maurice Taieb who surveyed the area in the 1960s. Ultimately, Taieb decided to focus his studies on an area North of Middle Awash called Hadar. Taieb recruited Yves Coppens, Don Johanson and Jon Kalb among others to help him with his work at Hadar (work is still taking place at Hadar to this day). This research team in 1972 and within 10 years found the first fossil hominids in the Afar Rift. In 1975 Jon Kalb decided to leave the Hadar team to start the Rift Valley Research Mission in Ethiopia (RVRME for short). The next year, the RVRME team discovered a Middle Pleistocene era hominid at a site known as Bodo. While fieldwork on this mission only went on until 1978, RVRME laid the groundwork for the Middle Awash Project, even going so far as to propose nomenclature for the entire Southern Afar Region. Though the nomenclature served as the basis of the past several decades of research, on their official website the Middle Afar Project had this to say: “the RVRME stratigraphic nomenclature impossible to apply because descriptions of beds and marker horizons were imprecise, upper and lower contacts were undefined, there was no valid mapping of a reference area, and boundaries between formations were set systematically at fault contacts. Radiometric dating and tephrachemistry were not done by the RVRME”. J. Desmond Clark talking with a colleague at an airport in West Africa. In 1981 Professor J. Desmond Clark, a prominent African prehistory expert of the 20th century, initiated the Middle Awash Project with the approval of the Ethiopian Culture Ministry. During the Project’s initial run researchers including Professor and paleontology expert Tim White explored both sides of the river. Clark recapped their time in his 1984 paper as when the “Archaeological excavations were undertaken at Bodo and Hargufia, the first radiometric dates for the area were determined, and the first Pliocene hominids were recovered”. Clark and White were planning to continue their research in Middle Awash however circumstances made this impossible. In October of 1982 the Ethiopian government banned all foreign prehistory expeditions while they reformulated their policies on international researchers. It was a response to foreign expeditions perceived inability to incorporate locals into their teams, tension between the Cultural Ministry (who had the authority to give foreign expedition permits since before the end of the monarchy in 1974) and the University of Addis Ababa (who wanted a greater role in expeditions), and the circumstances leading to the forced departure of RVRME lead researcher Jon Kalb in 1978 due to later disproven rumors that he was a CIA agent. Clark and White went to Addis Ababa to try and persuade the government to change their position. They were unsuccessful and had to submit a report to the National Science Foundation. The Middle Awash Project did not make it back to Ethiopia until 1990 when research resumed. Tim White with a cast of \\"Ardi\\", a well known Ardipithecus Ramidus fossil Upon the revival of the Middle Awash Project in 1990 there were a few slight changes in leadership. It was at this point that Tim White succeeded J.Desmond Clark as lead researcher. The other notable change that happened was by 1992 Dr.Giday WoldeGabriel joined the expedition as the Head of Geographical Studies and helped them finish the bulk of their work on the East Side of the Awash River.  Key discoveries  Middle Awash contains fossils existing from about 6 million years ago to 200 thousand years ago. Ardipithecus kadabba Ardipithicus kadabba was discovered in 1997 on the Western Side, at site Asa Koma, by Yohannes Haile Selassie and Giday WoldeGabriel. Ardipithecus kadabba is one of the earliest known hominids from the Late Miocene period. It was first announced in 2001, and further remains were announced in 2004. The Specimens found represent at least 7 individuals and were dated to 5.8-5.2 Ma. Primarily dental fossils were found but they do include a clavicle, a hand phalanx, ulna fragments and humerus fragments. Ar. Kadabba was originally considered a part of Ar. ramidus but was differentiated due to significant difference in their teeth. The presence of self sharpening upper canines was one such difference. Postranial evidence is less conclusive, as conflicting evidence both supports and opposes bipedalism. Ardipithecus ramidus Ardipithecus ramidus was discovered by Tim White in 1992 at Aarmis in Middle Awash. The initial assemblage was made up of 13 dental fragments, some cranial fragments, some postcranial fragments, including from the radius and ulna. Since, over 100 total specimens have been discovered from 36 individuals. While originally considered a new species of Australopithecus, this changed due to difference in the size of the molars and premolars, which fell outside the range of Australopithecus. It was then given a new genus, Ardipithecus. Ardipithecus ramidus was first recognized as a new genus and species in 1994 and 1995. In 2009, a complete description of a partial skeleton called “Ardi” was published in the journal Science. It was dated to approximately 4.4 Ma and was 120 cm tall and weighed 50 kg. The fossil was extremely fragmented and required much reconstruction, but eventually proved valuable for the knowledge of Ar. Ramidus. Similar to chimpanzees, Ar. Ramidus shows no signs of sexual dimorphism. Its reconstructed cranium is smaller than those of later hominins, and stable isotope analysis suggests a more omnivorous diet than great apes. Additionally, canines and third premolars set Ar. Ramidus apart from modern African Apes. These differences present evidence that canines were not as necessary for fighting and intimidation in Ar. Ramidus. Ar. Ramidus has a more primitive postcrania than subsequent hominins (had a primitive fully abductable big toe), but also demonstrated evidence of bipedalism, such as an inflexible midfoot. The pelvis has both primitive traits and traits closer to later hominids. While the ilia is relatively broad and representative of later hominids, the ischium is essentially identical to those of the Apes. Finally, the flexibility of the wrist suggests bipedalism. Australopithecus anamensis Australopithecus anamensis was found at Asa Issie and Aramis 14, both located in Middle Awash. Fossils found at Asa Issie include “2 partial maxillary dentitions, a partial metatarsal shaft, a foot phalanx, a hand phalanx, 4 vertebral fragments, and a proximal femur” belonging to at least 2 specimens. The cheek teeth of Au. anamensis are much larger than that of Ar. Ramidus, but approximately equal to Au. afarensis. Both individuals have relatively large canines and thicker molar enamel than Ar. Ramidus. There is little postcranial evidence for Au. Anamensisfound at Asa Issie. The hand phalanx is similar to those of Australopithecus and the femur is on the more primitive side of the range in Au. Afarensis. Postcrania found outside of Asa Issie suggests bipedalism and strong, tree-climbing arms. Australopithecus garhi A reconstructed Australopithecus Garhi skull from the National Museum of Ethiopia. Australopithecus garhi was discovered by Tim White in the Bouri Peninsula area of Middle Awash. It was announced in 1999. Au. Garhi has a holotype of a fragmented skull. The skull has all teeth but the left second and third molars, and additionally contains fragments of the frontal, parietal, and maxilla. Similarities in the cranial morphology to Au. Afarensis include the shape of the braincase and the relatively small brain size. The canines and incisors fall into the size range of Au. Afarensis, but the premolars and molars are comparatively very large. Pa. Boisei is the only hominin with larger post canines. Au. Garhi additionally has a thinner plate and cheekbones that flare less than usual. Additionally, Homo has wear patterns in cheek teeth like Au. Garhi. Limb fossils, such as a left femur, right humerus, radius, and ulna, parts of the fibula, and pieces of the foot, are located 278 meters from the skull. Some argue that these limb bones belong to the same specimen as the skull. This postcranial evidence cannot be ascribed with complete certainty to Au. Garhi. It does, however, possess attributes of both australopiths and homo. The phalanx is identical to that of Au. Afarensis. The limbs are a strange combination of resemblances to humans and australopiths, possibly implying a combination of bipedalism and climbing. Homo sapiens idaltu These earliest known Homo sapiens were discovered in 1997 at Herto Bouri by Tim White. It is dated to 0.16 Ma (160,000 years). It was first announced as a subspecies \\"idaltu\\" in 2003, but is often called “Herto Man.” The skull of Herto Man has features too archaic to be Homo sapiens, but is considered a direct ancestor of today’s humans.  Current project focus  The work of the Middle Awash Project is currently focused on the sites West of the Awash River because while there has been a long tradition of field work taking place on both sides, the Eastern side has been more thoroughly investigated. Lab work is primarily focused on fossils dated to approximately 4.4 million years ago as well as assembling additional Ardipithecus ramidus evidence for publication.

Geologic History & Stratigraphy Precambrian rocks only outcrop in the north in between the Sava River and Drava River and include amphibolite schist, micaschist, gneiss and granites. Early Paleozoic rocks include clastic rocks with calcareous intercalations near the Pannonian region and along the Inner Hinterland. Only Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian rocks have been confirmed with fossil evidence. Conglomerate, shale and sandstone are typical of the late Paleozoic. Inliers and overthrusts from this period (Carboniferous-Permian) are up to 3.5 kilometers thick in the Main Dinaric Ridge. A gap in sedimentation defines the boundary between the Permian and beginning of the Mesozoic in the Triassic. Allochthon dolomite and clastic rocks are common. Early Triassic rocks include siltite, mica, shale, thin limestone, gypsum and dolomite, while shelf limestone, dolomite and ammonite nests are typical of the Middle Triassic. Platy limestone, tuff and andesite from igneous activity are also common in this time frame. Up to 2.5 kilometers of reef limestone deposited in the Dinaric and Adriatic areas in the Jurassic and Malmian pelagic chert outcrops in the Main Dinaric Ridge. Oceanic rock appears in the Dogger-Malm time with green sandstone, peridotite, serpentinite, spilite, diabase and melaphyre. Platy limestone and chert deposited widely, up to four kilometers thick in the Cretaceous. Cenozoic Paleogene rocks unconformably overlie Cretaceous rocks with bauxite, coal and freshwater limestone, overlain by marine limestone from the Eocene and flysch formed in a trough between two carbonate platforms. Sandstone, marl and limestone deposited in basins now beneath the Adriatic Sea during the Neogene. In the Pannonian area, Neogene material lies on top of older bedrock, emplaced on the periphery of the Paratethys Ocean. Neogene rocks include marl, conglomerate, sandstone, as well as andesite and tuff. In the Drava River valley, the Neogene is seven kilometers thick. Many units contain lignit and oil is found in lower units. Sand and clay from the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary unconformably overlies Neogene rocks beneath the Adriatic. Karst rivers often contain glacial sediments and terra rossa is common both offshore and on the Main Dinaric Ridge. Structural & Tectonic Geology Croatia is part of the Dinarides. Early tectonic evolution in the Precambrian or Paleozoic is difficult to determine due to reworking in subsequent orogenies. The region's carbonate platform was split by an open sea belt in the Triassic, creating the Adriatic and Dinaric platforms. It resulted in local, intense continental subduction. Ultramafic ophiolite formed with the opening of a branch of the Tethys Ocean in the Cretaceous, followed by magmatic activity. With continued continental subduction in the Paleogene, uplift and the formation of tectonic windows began. The Adriaticum is a carbonate platform structural belt with Mesozoic-Paleogene flysch, chert and limestone superimposed on it. The Supradinaricum forms a nappe on the Dinaricum and are tectonically complex with oceanic rocks underlain by platform deposits. Evidence of the Carboniferous Variscan orogeny remains in Mt. Papuk in the east. Natural resource geology Coal, oil, gas and water are the leading natural resources in Croatia. The carbonate platform karst landscape of Croatia helped to create the weathering conditions to form bauxite. Anhydrite, gypsum, clay, sand amphibolite, granite, spilite, gabbro, diabase and limestone are all quarried for building.

This was the second presidential campaign of Zyuganov, who had previously run in the 1996 election (in which he had been a strong contender and had ultimately placed second). Background and early developments After losing the 1996 presidential election (which he had originally been the strong frontrunner for) to Boris Yeltsin, Zyuganov declared that the 1996 election nevertheless had demonstrated that a two-party political system was emerging in Russia and that the political might of the Communist-led campaign alliance could no longer be ignored by the Yeltsin administration. By 1999 Zyuganov had emerged as the evident frontrunner in every poll for the first round of the pending 2000 presidential election. However, polls also indicated that he would be unable to win an outright majority in the first round (which would be necessary for him to avoid a runoff), and that he was almost certain to lose against any prospective non- Communist opponent in a runoff. At this same time, Zyuganov and Yavlinsky were seen as the only two prospective candidates that were supported by a strong constituency and a national party. However, by the autumn of 1999 then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had overtaken Zyuganov as leading candidate in the polls. Campaigning Zyuganov (averaging 22% in polls) ultimately proved to be the only strong challenger to Putin. Zyuguanov's Communist Party conducted an orthodox campaign, relying heavily on grassroots door-to-door campaigning and a network of supportive Communist-aligned newspapers to spread its message. Zyuganov made little use of television advertising. The limited televised advertisements his campaign did run generally focused on his platform. Zyuganov ultimately outperformed polls, which had largely predicted that he would receive roughly 20% of the vote, and instead received 29% of the vote. Nonetheless, he failed to force Putin into a runoff. Positions Zyuganov agreed with Putin’s handling of the Second Chechen War. Zyuganov advocated a significantly expanded social safety net. His chief economist, Sergey Glazyev, promised that Russia 10% annual growth under Zyuganov's economic policies. His platform proposed the creation of a \\"regulated market\\", in which the state would hold a controlling share in certain key sectors of the economy, such as the energy, transport and military industries. In an adaption of trickle-down economics, Zyuganov proposed cutting taxes on domestic industry in half. He also proposed cuts to energy, transport and communications tariffs. Zyuganov advocated instating a state monopoly on alcohol and tobacco. He promised to deliver higher minimum wages. His proposed minimum wage increases would equal $105 per month for doctors and teachers and $35 for others, a significant increase from the existing minimum wage, which equaled just $14.

Both the Norwegian PST and the Danish PET also suspected the man to take part in the planning of an alleged assassination against the leader of the Iranian group Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz. He was arrested in Gothenburg the 21 October 2018. Denmark called for EU sanctions against Iran as a result. Tehran denied the allegation and raised suspicion over the timing of the incident, saying that the plot is devised to damage Iran-Europe relations at a critical time. Accusations of spying and assassination attempt Denmark's security services accused Iranian intelligence service of plotting an assassination on Danish territory. Danish police believe the Norwegian citizen observed and photographed outside the residence of a Danish-Iranian leader of the Iranian separatist movement ASMLA (an organization fights for independence for the Arabian-Iranian province Khuzestan). The search for the suspect led to a major security operation between Denmark and Sweden, including closing Denmark's borders. According to the Jerusalem Post, the suspect was found with photos of houses and apartments of ASMLA dissidents. On October 21, 2018, a Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent was arrested on suspicion of helping Iranian intelligence service \\"to act in Denmark\\" and planning to kill an ASMLA member. Danish prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen protested the alleged assassination plot in social media. According to the PET chief, there is reason to believe that the detained who now is in custody, has observed and photographed the leader of ASMLA's residence between 25-27 of September. He then intended to hand over the information gathered to Iranian authorities and also participating in the planning of an assassination plot of the ASMLA leader, which is stated in a press release from PET. Two additional Arab separatists living together in an apartment in Ringsted, 60km south-west of Copenhagen, were also targeted. Iran regards ASMLA as a terrorist organization. Norway summoned the Iranian ambassador over the incident. In October 2018, Denmark recalled its ambassador to Iran. The suspect, as well as Iran’s Foreign Ministry, have denied the accusations. In September 2018, Iran accused Denmark, the Netherlands, and Britain of hosting members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz, which Iran considers to be a \\"terrorist group\\" and accuses of being responsible for a 2018 terrorist attack in Ahvaz. In a 20 November 2018 session, the Radio & TV authority (Danish: Radio- og tv-nævnet) launched an investigation on whether broadcasts by the suspect amounted to hate speech or encouraging terrorism.

Geologic history, stratigraphy & tectonics Some of the oldest rocks in Greece are from the Paleozoic and are usually metamorphosed with no fossils. The Rhodope Massif spans the northern mainland, divided into amphibolite schist and gneiss, with comparatively recent granite intrusions from the Oligocene and Miocene. West of the Strymonas River is the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, covering the Chalkidiki Peninsula with thick marble and gneiss, with granite intrusions. Alpine cycle Alpine cycle sedimentary rocks are situated between the European hinterland in the Rhodope Massif and Serbo-Macedonian Massif and northern fore-region of the African plate. External zones include the Paxi Zone, encompassing the islands in the Ionian Sea with dolomitzed limestone from the Jurassic and Cretaceous-Miocene marl and gypsum. The Ionian Zone spans much of western Greece with Triassic evaporites overlain by Jurassic neritic limestones. During the Toarcian, extensive block faulting differentiated the Ionian Basin. Extensional faults were reactivated during the Eocene Alpine orogeny. The Ionian Zone is thrust westward over the Preapulian Zone and overlain by molasse facies. The Gavrovo-Tripolis Zone underlies Crete, the Dodecanese islands and much of the western mainland. Bauxites indicate a dry time in the Eocene and Oligocene flysch unconformably overlies older carbonates. The Peloponnesus and Crete regions of the zone are overthrust on the Plattenkalk unit. Normal faults with four kilometers of displacement are not uncommon although folding is limited—tectonic activity picked up in the Oligocene. Additionally, the Olonos-Pindus Zone extends from Montenegro to Rhodes and is a deep allochthon trough, with clastic Triassic sandstone and the Drymos Limestone. Internal zones Internal zones span between the Serbo-Macedonian Massif and external zones: *Pelagonian Zone: This zone includes metamorphosed rocks in Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Attica and Cyclades with an overlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic nappe. The schist-sandstone, Permian limestone, brecciated limestone and Triassic dolomite of its component unit—the Malliakos Series—has been used to infer the extension of the Olonos- Pindus Zone. *Zone of Eastern Greece: Parts of the Pelagonian Zone are covered by Cretaceous metamorphosed rocks. Paleozoic rocks include conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, tuff and limestone. Carbonate nerite deposited in the Triassic, together with bauxite and an ophiolite nappe was thrust to the west. Cretaceous limestones are the top unit, the Zone of Eastern Greece is overthrust onto external zones (which appear as tectonic windows). Axios Zone The Axios Zone, also known as the Vardar Zone, represents the closing of the Axios Ocean and separates the Pelagonian zone from the Serbo-Macedonian Massif. Clastic sediments from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic ophiolites and sediments are common. Geologists subdivide it into the calc-schists, granite, diabase, chert and ophiolite of the Paeonias subzone and the acidic volcanic rocks and limestone of the Triassic-Jurassic Paikon subzone (an old island arc). The silicified ophiolites of the Almopias subzone, bordering the Pelagonian zone to the northeast represents an old ocean trench. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Neogene sediment deposited after the Alpine cycle outcrops widely. The Mesohellene Trough, Epirus-Arkanania basin and Cycladic Basin are all examples of molasse basins from the early Miocene. The Ionian Islands basin is part of the Preapulian Zone and may only have had an interruption in sedimentation in the late Miocene into the Pliocene. Most sediments in other Neogene basins are marine, but the Aegean Islands basin is filled with continental sediments. As the molasse basins filled during Burdigalian and Langhian times, the uplift of the Pindus Cordillera caused nappe formations to slide onto metamorphic rocks of the Cyclades. In the Tortonian, arc fracturing brought subsidence of the Cretan Basin. Inland basins preserved numerous mammal fossils such as the Pikermi site north of Athens in continental clay. Volcanic activity in the Aegean began in the Neogene and Quaternary. Volcanoes in western Thrace, Limnos and Samothrace are on the edge of the Rhodope Massif, while the Aegean volcanic arc borders the Menderes Massif and Attico-Cycladic Massif. The Neogene Santorini volcanoes erupted in the Holocene, destroying the Mycenaen civilization. Interior basins hold thick lakebed sediments from the Quaternary, indicating oscillation between cold desert conditions and wet interglacials. Travertine springs often preserve more recent fossil assemblages. Near Corinth, brackish Black Sea water invaded during the Middle Pleistocene, although for the most part, the islands and water area of the Aegean did not change the during the ice ages. Natural resource geology *Asbestos: Occurs in joints in Western Macedonia and in the serpentinized edge of the Vourinos Massif *Antimony: Stibnite is found in Thrace and Macedonia, as well as in Devonian argillite veins on Chios island *Barite: Common in hydrothermal deposits and widely exported from the island of Mykonos for oil drilling. Also found on Kos and Polyvos with total reserves of several million tons. *Bauxite: Greece has over 1000 deposits particularly in the east-central part of the country, typically between limestone formations. *Bentonite: Several million tons of calcium-type bentonite is found on Kimolos and Milos and is often converted for higher swelling capacity by treating with sodium carbonate. Greece is the second largest bentonite producer after the United States. *Chromite: Hosted in peridotite, ophiolites and dunite. Near Vourinos is a deposit with 1.5 million tons of ore and an ancient mine in Thessalia extracted 500,000 tons by the 1990s. *Copper: The Chalkidiki Peninsula has 15 million tons of copper. Pyrite is common near East Peloponesus and disseminated copper sulfides are common in veins in Western Macedonia. *Iron: Greece has 200 small \\"soft\\" iron deposits and iron-nickel laterite 130 kilometers north of Athens with 200 million tons of ore Hydrocarbons Herodotus recognized a bitumen well at Limin Keri on the southern end of Zakynthos Island. Onshore oil exploration began in 1938 and moved offshore in 1970. The Prinos Anticline offshore was found to contain oil under Miocene rocks.

The large panel painting was created in 1600–1601.Fondazione Federico Zeri - Catalogo Fototeca The artwork is somewhat overshadowed by the two more famous paintings of Caravaggio on the side walls of the chapel: The Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus and The Crucifixion of Saint Peter. Both painters were important in the development of Baroque art but the contrast is striking: Carracci's Virgin glows with even light and radiates harmony, while the paintings of Caravaggio are dramatically lit and foreshortened.  History  The chapel in the left transept of the basilica was built by Monsignor Tiberio Cerasi, Consistorial Advocate and Treasurer-General to Pope Clement VIII. He purchased a chapel on the same spot from the Augustinian friars on 8 July 1600 and commissioned Carlo Maderno to rebuild the small edifice in Baroque style. In September Cerasi contracted Caravaggio to paint two panels for the side walls. Presumably another contract was signed at an early stage in the proceedings with Carracci for the altarpiece but this document has not been preserved.Denis Mahon: Egregius in Urbe Pictor: Caravaggio revised, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 93, No. 580 (Jul., 1951), p. 226 Preparatory studies and sketches by Carracci are preserved in the Royal Collection. The commissions went to the leading artists in Rome at the time: during these years Carracci was busy working on the famous fresco cycle of the Palazzo Farnese for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. Probably due to his increased workload in the palace, the three ceiling frescos in the chapel were executed by his assistant, Innocenzo Tacconi following Carracci's design. In these circumstances there was little reason for Carracci and Caravaggio to regard each other as business rivals, states Denis Mahon.Denis Mahon op. cit. p. 230 Tiberio Cerasi died on 3 May 1601 and was buried in the chapel. In his will he named the Fathers of the Hospital of the Madonna della Consolazione as his heirs with the responsibility to complete the still unfinished chapel.Christopher L. C. E. Witcombe, Two \\"Avvisi\\", Caravaggio, and Giulio Mancini, in: Source: Notes in the History of Art, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Spring 1993), pp. 22–29, pag. 22. Annibale's altarpiece was probably already complete as deduced from an avviso written perhaps by Giulio Mancini and dated to 2 June: > \\"The principal painting in the chapel [is] by the said Carracci, those three > paintings being, on the whole, of great excellence and beauty.\\" This is also confirmed by the fact that there are no recordings of payments in favor of Carracci in the documents concerning the management of the assets of Tiberio Cerasi drawn up after his death. The chapel was finally consecrated on 11 November 1606.Heather Nolin, \\"Non piacquero al Padrone: A Reexamination of Caravaggio's Cerasi Crucifixion of St. Peter, in:Rutgers Art Review 24 (2008), pag. 48. It was dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.  Description  The painting was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensembleThe altarpiece is the fulcrum of the decorative program of the chapel due to its subject and spatial position. There is a strong thematic connection with the scene of the Coronation of the Virgin in the central medaillon of the barrel- vault that shows the final episode in the Life of the Virgin after the Assumption. The painting also establishes a dialog with the two Caravaggio canvasses on the lateral walls: the most important figures among the apostles are Saint Peter (the older man on the left) and Saint Paul (on the right) in the foreground whose life story is told by Caravaggio (and also by the side paintings on the vault). The thematic and compositional connections prove that the altarpiece was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensemble and not as a standalone object. The rather crowded composition is organized around a triad of figures: the Virgin rising from the empty tomb (surrounded by a retinue of angels) and the two apostles gazing upwards in awe. All three wear robes in bright primary colours: blue over red (Mary), yellow over blue (Peter) and pink over green (Paul). The remaining space around the sarcophagus is filled with nine other apostles, bringing their overall number to eleven. \\"The stiffened forms and crowded composition [...] have been interpreted as a conscious shift to a 'hyper-idealized' manner that rejects the warmth and painterly qualities of his Bolognese period for a style indebted to ancient sculpture and to Raphael. Still neither ancient reliefs nor Raphael crowded their pictorial fields in this way\\", says Ann Sutherland Harris.Ann Sutherland Harris: Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, p. 43 The painting largely follows the iconographic tradition concerning the depiction of the Assumption in Western art. John the Evangelist (on the left) is portrayed as a beardless young man among the older and bearded apostles. One member of the angelic retinue can be identified as Archangel Michael who lifted up Mary's body to heaven. An apostle on the right is looking at the grave linens and the roses that were found in the empty sarcophagus.Peter and Linda Murray: The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 38 On the other hand, the prominent position of the principes apostolorum is a nod to local sensitivities. Mary seems to be projecting forward rather than upwards. It is a device that compensates for the confined environment and the rather low position of the altar. In this way, the Assumption meets the observer far beyond the narrow space of the Cerasi Chapel, ensuring its visibility from the transept, an ideal space for the continuation of Mary's motion. The dynamism, the emotional charge and the integration of the painting into real space are strongly innovative elements which make the panel unequaled among the contemporary altarpieces produced in Rome. Tomaso Montanari, Il Barocco, Torino, 2012, pp. 34-38.  Influences  Titian's AssumptionA supposed model for the central figure is the Virgin of the Assumption by Giuseppe Valeriano and Scipione Pulzone in the Church of the Gesù.Claudio Strinati, L'Assunzione della Vergine di Annibale Carracci, in Maria Grazia Bernardini (a cura di), Caravaggio Carracci Maderno. La cappella Cerasi in Santa Maria del Popolo a Roma, Cinisello Balsamo, 2001, p. 79. An even more important antecedent for the panel is the Transfiguration of Raphael, a masterpiece that Carracci much loved and studied. That Carracci took inspiration for the lighting - a strong spotlight effect giving a sculptural look to the forms - from Raphael, becomes clear if compare the figure of Saint Peter with the Saint Peter in the same location on the Transfiguration.Catherine E. Kopp: “The Carracci and Venice: Annibale Carracci's stylistic response to Venetian art, and the intermediate roles of Ludovico and Agostino Carracci, thesis, Queen's University, 2014, p.237 The Assumption of the Virgin by Titian was another great Renaissance painting that may have influenced Carracci while working on the same subject, especially regarding the heads of some of the apostles in deep shadow and in profil perdu. The relationship between the paintings of Caravaggio and Carracci in the chapel is a perpetual subject of discussion in art history. It seems probable that each artist \\"subtly altered his style of painting as a result of this direct confrontation with the other\\", and \\"Annibale's monumental saints, whose hands and feet seem to pierce the picture plane\\" may have influenced Caravaggio.Kate Ganz: Annibale's Rome: Art and Life in the Eternal City, in The Drawings of Annibale Carracci, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1999, p. 203. The Cerasi Assumption was a turning point in Annibale's painting style as his compositions became darker, the figures larger and more monumental during the last phase of his career. Donald Posner termed his style in this period 'hyper-idealized'. The painting was not regarded among Carracci's best works by his two 17th-century biographers. Giovanni Pietro Bellori only mentions it shortly when listing the late works of the artist while Carlo Cesare Malvasia is even more dismissive.Malvasia's Life of the Carracci: Commentary and Translation, trans. by Anne Summerscale, The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000, p. 178 Modern art history showed more appreciation. \\"The visual effects ensured that the spectators in the chapel space experienced for themselves the onrush of divine energy as the Virgin soared from the tomb, outward and over their heads into the painted vault of the crossing, where the actual Coronation was painted\\", says Rosemary Muir Wright. \\"The Virgin herself had become an icon of ideal beauty in a form which owed much of its perfection to the model of Raphael. This idealization provided the necessary reminder of the supernatural nature of the event, despite the obvious visual conviction of natural form and three-dimensional space.\\"Rosemary Muir Wright: Sacred Distance: Representing the Virgin Mary in Italian Altarpieces, 1300-1630, Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 110  Gallery  File:Study for the Assumption of Cerasi Chapel.jpg|Saint Peter, preparatory study, Royal Collection File:Study for the Assumption of Cerasi Chapel3.jpg|Hands of an apostle, preparatory study, Royal Collection File:Robes of the virgin carracci.jpg|Robes of the Virgin, preparatory study, Royal Collection File:Carracci two apostles study.jpg|Two apostles bending over the tomb, sketch in the Royal Collection  References  Category:1600s paintings Category:Paintings by Annibale Carracci Carracci Category:Altarpieces Category:Angels in art Category:Artworks in Santa Maria del Popolo ","title":"Assumption of the Virgin (Cerasi Chapel)"},{"id":"58921819","text":"Khalid Gadallah (born 1955) is an Egyptian footballer.

She lives in Auckland, New Zealand.  Biography  Cath (Catherine) Mayo grew up in Auckland, New Zealand. Books were an important part of her childhood and she can remember being captivated by Barbara Leonie Picard’s retelling of The Odyssey of Homer, so much so that she used to act out parts of the story and make up extra scenes herself. Two other favourite historical authors were Rosemary Sutcliff and Mary Renault. She went on to study a wide variety of subjects at the University of Auckland, including history, art history, philosophy, geology, French, music and performance violin. Later she returned to university to study Ancient Greek, so as to be able to read and understand Homer's poetry in more depth, and she has continued to read and learn about the archaeology of Late Bronze Age Greece. In 1977, she began an apprenticeship in violin-making and restoration. She trained overseas with world-renowned luthiers Vahakn Nigogosian and Christoph Gotting and works as a luthier (a violin maker and restorer) under her maiden name, Cath Newhook, at The Stringed Instrument Company Limited. During the 1980s, she was a member of the band Gentle Annie which toured Oregon and Alaska in 1980. The band performed alongside Limbs Dance Company in Los Angeles in 1986 and at the World Expo in Brisbane in 1988. It played many live shows and appeared as a feature act and as backing vocal group on the television programme That's Country. Cath won the Australian national bluegrass fiddle championship at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in January 1983. She co-wrote and performed a piece of music for the opening ceremony of the Auckland Commonwealth Games in 1990, and has played and recorded with singer songwriter Al Hunter and The 1932 Jazz Orchestra. When she began to write, her interest in the overlap between history and legends led to fictional re-imaginings of Late Bronze Age Greece, around the time of the Trojan War, featuring the Greek hero Odysseus. She has been to Greece three times, has written about some of her travels there and continues to be fascinated by the layers of history visible in the ancient sites and buildings. She has won prizes in several short story competitions and was mentored during the writing of her first book by New Zealand author William Taylor. Some of her work has been published in the New Zealand School Journal. In 2014 she spoke at Victoria University of Wellington's Athens to Aotearoa conference, looking from a writer's perspective at Classical Greek influences in New Zealand. In 2016 she presented a paper at the IBBY Conference in Auckland, titled A Reader's odyssey: parallel journeys on the far side of the world; this covered the parallels between Homer's world and traditional Maori and Polynesian culture. Her novel Athena's Champion, co-written with David Hair, is the first in a series of adult fantasy novels, set in Ancient Greece, in which Odysseus again features as the main character.  Awards and prizes  Cath Mayo was shortlisted for the Storylines Tom Fitzgibbon Award in 2008. Her first book, Murder at Mykenai, which focuses on Odysseus and Menelaos as teenagers, received a Storylines Notable Book Award for Young Adult Fiction in 2014.

Geologic history The geologic development of the territory of the Czech Republic was influenced by the cratonization of the Bohemian Massif at the end of the Permian. and with simultaneous orogenic activation of the Carpathian basement. Simultaneously, orogenic activity activated Carpathian basement. The pre-Pan- African elements of the Bohemian Massif remain poorly understood because of their allochthonous position in Pan-African and Variscan units. The Svetlik orthogneiss in southern Bohemia is 2.1 billion years old and the Dobra granite gneiss is 1.37 billion years old. Together, they may be the oldest elements of the Bohemian Massif. The Svetlik orthogneiss occurring between the Monotonous and Varied Groups of the Moldanubicum might correspond to Gondwana-derived terrane (the Penteverian crust formed 2.1 billion years ago). The age of 1.37 billion year age of the Dobra Gneiss suggests possible origin as Laurentia or Baltica. The Pan-African orogenic belt formed 800-570 million years), formed between Laurentia and Gondwana as well as microcontinent segments, can be traced to the Bohemian Massif. For instance, Precambrian metamorphic rocks act as a footwall of conglomerates from the early Cambrian conglomerates, formed the 550 to 580 million years ago in the Lugian Pluton, the 520 660 year old Ma Brno pluton is similar. Cadomian, Pan-African 600 million year old overprinting on zircons is found in many parts of Europe. In addition to debates about the Pan-African orogeny, the Caledonian orogeny in the Bohemian Massif is poorly understood. In the Saxothuringicum area and in the major part of the Lugicum, there is no break at the Silurian-Devonian boundary. Sedimentary deposition began in the early Cambrian and in elsewhere in the Ordovician and ended by the mid-Carboniferous orogeny 330 to 320 million years ago. The few indications of the Silurian/Devonian hiatus in N Lugicum are not of regional significance. Higher ages of the amphibolites (ophiolite) complex of the Marinaska Lazne (486 Ma) point to an early Ordovician extension (Bowes and Aftalion, 1991, Medaris, Jelinek and Misaf 1994) and c. 500 Ma granite gneisses of the Lugicum (Kroner, Hegner and Jaeckel, 1994) early Ordovician magmatic activity, However, these ages have to be considered as minimum ones. In the Brunovistulicum the transgression of early Devonian conglomerates on the pre-Devonian of rome precisely the Pan-African basement seaks favorably of its geotectonic independence on W units of the Bohemian Massif. At the time of oceanic subduction of the Rhenohercynicum below the Saxothuringicum, areas of the Bohemian Massif were reworked. Moldanubicum rocks experienced very intensive reconstruction, producing mantle-crust interaction granulite and eclogite facies rocks. Nappe and shear tectonics appeared the Moldanubicum as it was joined with the Moravosilesicum and Brunovistulicum to other segments of the Bohemian Massif. Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago- present) A platform cycle began at the Permian-Triassic boundary with periodic erosion and occasional marine transgressions into the late Cretaceous and Paleogene, coupled with alkali volcanic activity. Radial faulting during the Alpine orogeny took place. Pre-Triassic development of the Czech West Carphathians is related to the Brunovistulicums. The pre-Devonian basement and the sedimentary cover of the Brunovistulicum underlie the Mesozoic and Cenozoic formations in the West Carpathians. Limestone in the south are from the Triassic and Jurassic. To the north is an allochtonous ocean environment, to the north of the Klippen Belt. The Outer Flysch Carpathians formed after the main Carpathian Orogeny in the late Cretaceous, showing synorogenic sedimentary sequences from Cretaceous-Oligocene age that move northward as far as the Carpathian Foredeep. The last thrusting in late Miocene brought erosion, local uplifting and subsidence in Quaternary depressions. Natural resource geology Resource such as silver, gold and iron ore have been mined since the Middle Ages. The Bohemian Massif and the Western Carpathians are the main metallogenic zones. The Bohemian Massif is characterized by icomplex, mostly epigenetic, mineralization of Variscan age including gold, tin, uranium, silver, lead, zinc and limited copper together black coal deposits from both the Carboniferous and Cenozoic. The West Carpathians have no resources. A few oil fields, such as the Hodonin field in the Vienna basin exist. Moldanubian metallogenic province Moldanubian metallogenic province covers most of the Moldanubicum. In the Moldanubian subprovince, lead and zinc form as vein deposits with silver in the aureole of the Central Moldanubian Pluton and Central Bohemian Pluton (including ore districts such as Kutna Hora, Prribram and Jihlava). Vein deposits of gold ores and the disseminated gold deposit at Mokrsko, south of Prague are limited to the western contact with the Central Bohemian Pluton. Uranium ore deposits in the Pribram district or near the contact of the Bohemicum-Moldanubicum, northeast of the Cesky les Tachov or at the contact of the Central Moldanubian Pluton have been investigated since the 1980s. An unusual zinc-copper ore deposit was mined in the last after 1982 in the Ransko gabbro-peridotite massif which also shows some nickel sulfide mineralization. The Krkonose Mountains metallogenic subprovince in the Lugicoum area, centers on the Krkonose Pluton and the Orlicke hory Mountains-Klodzko subrovince. It has highly variable deposit of little economic importance including lead, zinc, copper and gold.

Dr. Nemes has been an associate professor at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) since January 2018. Prior to his appointment there, he was an assistant professor at the Department of Chemistry at George Washington University (Washington, DC), where he taught bioanalytical chemistry. Peter Nemes graduated with summa cum laude with a Master's of Science (M.Sc.) from the Eötvös Loránd University in 2004. His original thesis research was conducted in the Department of Mass Spectrometry at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary. Under mentorship by Dr. Vekey Karoly, Mr. Nemes studied the formation of amino acid clusters in the gas phase upon electrospray ionization,1 such as the magic serine clusters that preferentially incorporat amino acids and sugars of certain chirality matching those enriched on Earth. During his PhD in Prof. Dr. Akos Vertes’ laboratory at the Department of Chemistry, The George Washington University (GWU; Washington, DC) between 2005–2009, he established the significance of spraying modes/regimes during electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) in efficient and soft ion generation2 and the confirmational state of proteins3. He also invented and patented laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI)4 mass spectrometry for in situ and in vivo analysis4 of tissues and single cells5 2- and 3-dimensional molecular imaging MS6 at ambient conditions for biological samples. He completed postdoctoral training in analytical neuroscience with Prof. Dr. Jonathan V. Sweedler at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL. There, he developed capillary electrophoresis ESI MS instruments7 and built a unique matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI–C60 secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) dual-ion source mass spectrometer8 to enable the analysis of small and large molecules in single cells.9 In 2011, Dr. Nemes became a Staff Fellow and then also Laboratory Leader at the US Food and Drug Administration (2011–2013). An independent investigator, Dr. Nemes developed a high-throughput approach10 based on Direct analysis in real time to enable the rapid differentiation of heparin from glycosaminoglycans, including authentic adulterated products confiscated by the FDA during the 2008 heparin crisis. Dr. Nemes also established the mass spectrometry facility at the White Oak Headquarters of the US FDA with several mass spectrometers to support regulatory science. As a professor since 2013, Dr. Nemes has conducted cutting-edge research at the interface of bioanalytical instrumental chemistry and neurodevelopmental biology and taught courses in analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry. In Fall 2013, Dr. Nemes became an assistant professor at the Department of Chemistry at George Washington University (Washington, DC), where he taught analytical chemistry. In January 2018, Dr. Nemes became an associate professor at the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), where he has been teaching instrumental analytical chemistry and biological mass spectrometry. Research in the Nemes Laboratory develops ultrasensitive and microanalytical platforms for high-resolution MS to study metabolic and proteomic processes with implications in cell and neurodevelopmental biology and health research. Using custom-built single-cell MS instruments, his research group has uncovered previously unknown metabolomic11 and proteomic12 differences between single embryonic cells that are fated to give rise to different types of tissues during vertebrate development. Their highly sensitive bottom-up proteomic approach enabled the detection intra-cell type cell heterogeneity in the embryo.13 Further, the group has also discovered molecules that are able to alter normal cell fate decisions in the embryo.11 The investigators next developed microprobe technologies that enabled the direct, in vivo analysis of these small14 and large15 molecules in cells in X. laevis embryos undergoing normal development. These results challenge basic understanding of molecular processes that are necessary for normal embryonic body and brain development and raise important implications to help understand, promote, and protect the health of humans and animals.16 Prof. Nemes has authored 46 peer-reviewed publications, 6 book chapters, and ~200 presentations. In 2015, Prof. Nemes was named a Beckman Young Investigator by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation and received the Arthur F. Findeis Award for Achievements by a Young Analytical Chemist by the Division of Analytical Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. In 2017, he received the DuPont Young Professor Award, the Robert J. Cotter New Investigator Award by the US Human Proteome Organization, and a Research Award from the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS). In 2018, Prof. Nemes was awarded the Georges Guiochon Faculty Fellowship from HPLC, Inct. Research in the Nemes Lab has been continuously funded by professional societies, companies, and federal funding agencies.

Berger argues that the U.S. Supreme Court is not actually empowered to rewrite the U.S. Constitution--including under the guise of interpretation--and that thus the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently overstepped its designated authority when it used its powers of interpretation to de facto rewrite the U.S. Constitution in order to reshape it more to its own liking. (By de facto rewriting the U.S. Constitution, Berger means that the U.S. Supreme Court didn't actually alter the text of the US Constitution but nevertheless interpreted it in such a way that the U.S. Supreme Court altered the meaning and/or the effects of the relevant parts of the U.S. Constitution.) Summary U.S. Congressman John Bingham. Berger argued that Bingham's views in regards to incorporation were unorthodox and not shared by most of his Congressional colleagues. The U.S. Supreme Court building. In his book, Berger argued that the Supreme Court went beyond its constitutional authority in rewriting the U.S. Constitution and especially the 14th Amendment. U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren and the court that he led were very prominent targets of Berger's criticism in Government by Judiciary due to their willingness to ignore original intent when making various rulings of theirs. The Warren Court sometime between 1958 and 1962. The Warren Court decided important cases such as Brown v. Board of Education, Reynolds v. Sims, and Loving v. Virginia. In this book, Berger argues that the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted based on the original intent of its draftsmen. Berger argues that this is how the U.S. Constitution was historically interpreted as well as how the draftsmen of the 14th Amendment intended for this Amendment to be interpreted. Berger also argues that the sole purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize the Civil Rights Act of 1866. (Berger rejects the use of statements by critics of the Fourteenth Amendment to advance a broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment by arguing that these statements were made to make the Fourteenth Amendment look terrifying in order to increase the odds that this Amendment be rejected and defeated.) Specifically, the purpose of that Act was to tear down the Black Codes in the post-Civil War Southern U.S. and to give the freedmen basic rights such as freedom of contract, the right to sue and be sued, to travel and work wherever they please, and to buy, sell, and own property. Berger argues that, in the view of its draftsmen, the 1866 Civil Rights Act did not require U.S. states to allow African-Americans to serve on juries, to vote, to intermarry with White people, or to go to the same schools that White people went to. Thus, Berger argues that numerous U.S. Supreme Court decisions based on the Fourteenth Amendment have been wrongly decided since they were decided contrary to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions include the 1880 case Strauder v. West Virginia (which stated that African- Americans cannot be prohibited from serving on juries), the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education (which struck down school segregation), the 1960s one person, one vote cases such as Reynolds v. Sims, and the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia (which struck down bans on interracial marriage). Berger also criticizes the argument made by Alexander Bickel, William Van Alstyne, and others that the 14th Amendment's language was meant to be open-ended in order to give future generations a large amount of discretion in determining how to apply the 14th Amendment's principles to their own times. Berger argues that the \\"open-ended language\\" theory lacks any historical basis whatsoever and that, in any case, any intentions that existed but were not disclosed to the American people before they ratified a constitutional amendment certainly have no value and shouldn't be used as a basis for interpreting this amendment. In Berger's view, the ideas of substantive due process as well as the incorporation of the Bill of Rights (against the states) are both contrary to the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment. In regards to incorporation of the Bill of Rights, Berger argues that the views of John Bingham and Jacob Howard in regards to this issue were unorthodox (Bingham and Howard both stated that the 14th Amendment would apply the first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights against the states) and that most Republicans in the 39th United States Congress (which proposed and passed the 14th Amendment) did not share Bingham's and Howard's views on this issue. As support for his position, Berger points out that none of the Republicans who spoke about the 14th Amendment on the campaign trail leading up to the 1866 elections ever said or even suggested that the 14th Amendment would apply any of the amendments in the Bill of Rights against the states and that court rulings shortly after the 14th Amendment's ratification in 1868 continued to hold that the Bill of Rights was inapplicable against US states (as opposed to the US federal government--against which the Bill of Rights was always held to be applicable). Finally, Berger defends the holding in the notorious 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson and argues that the reason that \\"Plessy has become a symbol of evil[] ... is because we impose 'upon the past a creature of our own imagining' instead of looking to 'contemporaries of the events we are studying.'\\" Berger argues that \\"Plessy merely reiterated what an array of courts had been holding for fifty years\\"--starting with the 1849 Massachusetts Supreme Court case Roberts v. City of Boston (which upheld the constitutionality of segregated schools in Massachusetts). Berger supported the idea of US constitutional change through the Article V amendment process but did not believe that the US judiciary actually had the authority to de facto amend the US Constitution under the guise of interpretation outside of the Article V amendment process--including when achieving change through the Article V amendment process looked extremely unrealistic. Berger believed that not every injustice actually has a judicial remedy and that therefore the fact that an injustice exists does not automatically mean that the U.S. federal judiciary actually has the authority to eliminate this injustice. Also, Berger argues that the U.S. Congress and not the courts were meant to have the exclusive authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. In Berger's view, the courts would only be allowed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment if the U.S. Congress was to delegate this authority to them. Berger points out that, at the time of the 14th Amendment's drafting and ratification in the late 1860s, there was still widespread distrust of judicial review among Northerners and abolitionists due to them still remembering that the antebellum U.S. judiciary has generally not ruled in favor of abolitionists but instead made various pro-slavery rulings such as Prigg v. Pennsylvania and Dred Scott v. Sandford that strongly incensed abolitionists. Aftermath After this book was published, Berger spent twenty years responding to his critics--writing \\"forty article-length rebuttals and one of book length.\\" The scholars and law professors whom Berger responded to include (but are not limited to) John Hart Ely, Aviam Soifer, Louis Fisher, Michael Kent Curtis (author of Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\"), Paul Brest, Paul Dimond, Lawrence G.

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Health. It was constructed by Manuel Ramos Parente and his wife Maria de Almeida Reis on the second line of hills below the Historic Center of Salvador in the 18th century. The first mass was celebrated in 1726, the same year that Parente died. The church is noted for the painting on the ceiling of the nave by Domingos da Costa Filgueira (?—1797), the first in Bahia. The interior of the church was slowly completed into the 19th century; it now has neoclassical interior elements and an elaborate Baroque and rococo façade. Its two towers have elaborately tiled tops. History The Church of Our Lady of Health and Glory was constructed on land owned by Lieutenant-Colonel Manuel Ramos Parente on farmland known as Alvo. Construction of the church was funded by Parente and his wife, Maria de Almeida Reis. The cornerstone of the church was placed on February 2, 1723 by Vasco Fernandes Cesar de Menezes, the 4th Viceroy of Brazil. An image of Our Lady of Health was installed in the church in the following year after a long procession followed by a festival. The chancel, vestry, and tribunes were completed in 1726; the first mass was celebrated in the church in the same year. Manuel Ramos Parente died in 1726 and his widow, Maria de Almeida Reis, completed the construction of the church. Antônio Roiz Mendes, a master carver, completed the altarpiece of the main chapel between 1769 and 1770. Domingos da Costa Filgueira was commissioned to complete ceiling paintings in the nave, vestry, and below the choir in the same year. The carvings were renovated and replaced by Francisco Hermógenes de Figueiredo between 1814 and 1827. The provenance of images in the church is difficult to determine, but the master sculptor Felix Pereira Guimarães was commissioned to complete some works according to records of February 1791. Marble floor covering of the nave, sacristy, and aisles was installed by 1844. Attendance at the church declined by 1841; mass was suspended in 1887 for further renovations to the structure. J. Rabut restored the ceiling of the nave in 1887, but significantly altered the artwork. Marble tiles were installed in the churchyard, and railing and an iron gate were installed. These works were completed in 1889 and the church reopened to worship. IPHAN evaluated the structure between 1942 and 1949. The roof partially collapsed in 1951; emergency measures were taken in the same year to stabilize the structure. The church closed again in 1959 for further works. The interior walls of the nave, window frames, and high altar were restored. The church was painted in 1965 without authorization by IPHAN. A slab was placed in the back of the church. Location The Church of Our Lady of Health and Glory is located in the second line of hills east of the Historic Center of Salvador. The church sits on the convergence of five streets and opens onto a wide square. The church square is surrounded by Portuguese-style houses constructed in the 19th century. Structure The Church of Our Lady of Health and Glory was constructed of stone and brick masonry with marble flooring. The façade has been modified over time. Its current form dates to the 19th century and resembles that of the Church of Our Lady of Penha to the north, which was constructed in the same period. It has a central body flanked by two towers. The three sections of the church are divided by pilasters. A central stone doorway opens to the nave and has three windows at the choir level. The central part of the church has a rococo-style pediment and dates to the late 19th century. Each of the towers has a door opening to the lateral corridors. They have pear-shaped tops are tiled in ceramic fragments, similar to those of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo. The churchyard is semi- circular with iron railings dating to 1887. Interior The church has a single nave with lateral corridors and tribunes, a design typical of the early 18th century. The consistory and sacristy sit on either side of the chancel. Carvings on the altar, the cross arch, tribunes, choir screen, and pulpits were completed between 1769 and 1770 by Domingos da Costa Filgueira; they were replaced in 1814 by neoclassical design elements. The left side altar has an image of Saint Anthony of Padua; the altar on the right has an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The high altar has an image of Our Lady of Health below the Crucifix below an elaborate baldachin. Ceilings with elaborated painting were introduced to Brazil in the first half of the 18th century; they were inspired by the Church of St. Ignatius of Rome, painted in 1694 by Andrea Pozzo. The ceiling painting of the nave of the Church of Our Lady of Health and Glory is the work of the Bahian painter Domingos da Costa Filgueira (died 1797); it is in the Baroque trompe-l'œil style and was completed in 1769. It is one of the first ceiling paintings of its type in Bahia. The painting has, at its center, a large image of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary; the remainder of the ceiling is painted with angels, flowers, arches, and columns. Azulejo tiles line the lower parts of the chancel and nave; they were imported from Lisbon between 1780 and 1790. They depict the Four Evangelists, Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, and Our Lady of Sorrows. The sacristy is located to the right (south) of the chancel. It has lost its perspective ceiling painted executed by Domingos da Costa Gilgueira in 1769. The ceiling now has a work completed by the engraver João Nunes Pereira in 1845. Its quality is listed as \\"mediocre\\" by the historian Marieta Alves. Protected status The Church of Our Lady of Health and Glory was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1941. Access The church is open to the public and may be visited.

The stable Fennoscandian Shield formed from 1.45 billion years ago to 850 million years ago in the Proterozoic. The Fennoscandian Border Zone is a large fault, bounding the deep basement rock of the Danish Basin—a trough between the Border Zone and the Ringkobing-Fyn High. The Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone is a fault-bounded area displaying Cretaceous-Cenozoic inversion. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Cambrian rocks record successive marine transgression and regression events. Feldspar-rich red bed sandstones deposited in windy floodplains followed by layers of glauconite- rich marine sandstones and offshore siltstone. Black alum shales deposited in the mid-Cambrian in a nearly anoxic epeireic basin with limestone layers, rich in trilobite fossils. Condensed, shallow limestone succeeded the black shales in the Ordovician, with numerous graptolite fossils. Devonian rocks have never been found in Denmark and marine Carboniferous rocks are only known from drill holes at the southern edge of the Ringkobing-Fyn High, which formed at the time as a bulging area north of the Variscan collision zone. Rotational block faulting in the Late Carboniferous resulted from Variscan wrench deformation, active along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone. Syn-rift clastic wedges began to accumulate in an emerging half-graben. Continental red beds deposited and volcanism occurred. Regional sagging began in the mid-Permian, leaving the Ringkobing-Fyn High as a high point. Marine transgression began, connecting the region with a narrow seaway to the Shetland Islands. The Danish Basin and the neighboring North German Basin were both highly saline and brackish, leaving behind carbonate and anhydrite layers on southern edge of the High. Up to 1.2 kilometers of halite accumulated in the North Permian Basin, thinning toward the Fennoscandian Border Zone. Subsequent salt tectonism has produced salt diapirs 10 kilometers in diameter, rising five kilometers through overhead rock and some are less than 200 meters deep in Quaternary rocks. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) North-south rifting with the breakup of Pangea in the Triassic segmented the Ringkobing-Fyn High into a narrow graben. Sedimentation occurred in fault-bound alluvial fan deposits with occasional small marine transgressions, such as the Muschekalk Sea in the mid- Triassic in the Ringkobing-Fyn High. Triassic outcrops are only found on southern shore of Bornholm. Extensional faulting occurred throughout the Mesozoic, but overall, conditions remained the same into the Cretaceous. Oscillating marine transgressions in the Rhaetian to Middle Jurassic shifted deposition from delta sands to offshore mudstones and regional updoming took place at the junction of the Central Graben, Moray Firth and Viking Graben. Deltas were drowned and replaced with deepwater basins and major rifting in the Late Jurassic produced block tilting. Sedimentation shifted in Albian through Danian times from siliclastic to carbonaceous, marked by marl and glauconite sandstones. Sea level fell in the Maastrichtian, restricting the sea to deeper areas of the Central Graben. The Stevns Klint type locality contains the Fish Clay with an iridium anomaly indicative at the K-Pg mass extinction. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) During the Damian Stage, carbonate deposit stopped, bringing an erosional unconformity. As the Selandian transgressive phase got underway glauconite sand and older, reworked Cretaceous and Devonian sediments deposited, overlain by pelagic smectite clay. Erosion in the Neogene and Pleistocene has eroded most rock units that would likely have indicated open marine conditions. A break in sedimentation in the Oligocene was followed by a marine transgression and sediment accumulated in the Danish Basin, with significant coarse quartz sand compared to older Paleogene clays. The deepest point of deposition—the depocenter—moved toward the North Sea and Central Graben during the Oligocene and the coastline shifted to the Fennoscandian Border Zone in Jylland. This was a result of regional uplift of the Norwegian Caledonides and the Fennoscandian Shield. The Caledonides were actually eroded to a nearly flat peneplain by the Permian and so the uplift was a non-orogenic and comparatively recent one. Shallow marine deposition continued until the Pleistocene with increasing sand and coal from the Miocene. Up to three kilometers of sand accumulated in the Central Graben. During the Pleistocene the region was glaciated multiple times, leaving glaciofluvial plains in the west and clay soils in the east. Isostatic rebound and post-glacial thin-skinned folding and thrusting have been common geologic forces in the Holocene. Natural resource geology Denmark has few natural resources although some small oil and gas fields have been found offshore since the 1970s. Gravel, sand, and chalk are all mined for building material and in North Jylland plastic clay and diatomite are extracted as insolation material.

It is a palearctic species living in shallow-water coastal habitats, and occurring in some freshwater lakes far from the sea. Taxonomy This flatworm was first described in 1874 by the French zoologist Georges Du Plessis who gave it the name Mesostoma auditivum. Because of its unique characteristics, in 1882 Ludwig von Graff erected the genus Otomesostoma to accommodate it and it became Otomesostoma auditivum. It is one of only two species in the genus, the other being Otomesostoma arovi, described from Lake Baikal by Timoshkin, Lukhnev and Zaytseva in 2010. Distribution Otomesostoma auditivum is mainly known from marine and brackish water habitats, but it is also found in freshwater locations. It is a holarctic species and has been recorded from the North Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, including United States, Greenland, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, the Ural Mountains and Lake Baikal. It is a benthic species and its depth range in marine habitats is between . In Echo Lake in the Sierra Nevada, California, it is found at between whereas in some Alpine lakes in Europe it occurs at depths of . In Lake Baikal, it coexists with endemic related species of flatworm in the shallows, its first record in Asia and a rare example of the Palearctic and Baikalian faunas coming into contact with each other. It is one of several flatworms more familiar from marine or brackish water habitats that have appeared in the Konin Lakes in central Poland since two power stations started discharging water into the lakes, raising their temperature markedly. Genome The genome size of Otomesostoma auditivum is 18,390 Mb (megabases), the largest genome of any known flatworm species, and nearly six times as large as the human genome (3200 Mb).

Discovery In 1992, Xavier Valentin at Velaux–La Bastide Neuve, in the south of France, discovered a rich fossil site. Between 2009 and 2012, pterosaur remains were excavated. The pterosaur was reported in the scientific literature in 2015.Cincotta, A., J. Yans, P. Godefroit, G. Garcia, J. Dejax, M. Benammi, S. Amico, and X. Valentin. 2015. \\"Integrated paleoenvironmental reconstruction and taphonomy of a unique Upper Cretaceous vertebrate-bearing locality (Velaux, southeastern France)\\". PLoS ONE 10: e0134231 In 2018, the type species Mistralazhdarcho maggii was named and described by Romain Vullo, Géraldine Garcia, Pascal Godefroit, Aude Cincotta and Xavier Valentin. The generic name connects the mistral, a northern wind typical for the area of discovery, with Azhdarcho, the type genus of the Azhdarchidae. The specific name honours Jean-Pierre Maggi, the mayor of Velaux, for his support of the La Bastide Neuve paleontological project. The holotype, MMS/VBN.09.C.001, was discovered in a sandstone layer of the Aix-en- Provence basin, dating from the late Campanian, about seventy-two million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It contains the symphysis of the lower jaws, the atlas-axis complex of the front neck, a middle neck vertebra, the left humerus, a piece of the right humerus, the left radius, the right pteroid, the shaft of the fourth metacarpal, the proximal part of the first phalanx of the wing finger, the distal part of the same phalanx, and four bone fragments that could not be identified including some articular surface and two shafts. The skeleton was not found articulated but the bones were discovered on a limited surface of five square metres within the total surface of 140 square metres formed by the fossil layer. Therefore, it was concluded they represent a single individual. It is probably a subadult. Description Mistralazhdarcho is a large pterosaur. The humerus was estimated to have had an original length of nineteen centimetres. This indicates a wingspan of 424 centimetres using a formula devised by Alexandr Averianov. Another possible method is to extrapolate the wingspan from the known skeleton of the azhdarchid Zhejiangopterus. This results in an estimate of 485 centimetres. Both estimates seem to corroborate the hypothesis that the holotype individual had a span of about 4.5 metres. However, it was not yet fully grown. It was estimated that an adult exemplar could have had a five to six metres wide wingspan. The describing authors indicated some distinguishing traits. One of these was an autapomorphy, a unique derived character. The upper surface of the symphysis of the lower jaws shows a well-developed elevation on the midline in a relatively forward position of eighteen centimetres behind the mandible tip, compared to thirty-two centimetres with the related form Alanqa. A second trait is a possible autapomorphy only. The tip of the lower jaws is somewhat curved to below. However, its uniqueness is conditional on Aerotitan not having such a curved tip. This latter pterosaur was originally described as not having one but the authors, while studying Mistralazhdarcho, concluded that the Aerotitan description was likely mistaken and that its curved holotype did not represent the middle of the jaws but their front end. Additionally, a unique combination was given of traits that in themselves are not unique. The upper surface of the symphysis or fusion of the lower jaws shows elevated but blunt ridges on its edges. This symphysis has a V-shaped cross-section, thus lacking a lower crest. The underside of the atlas-axis complex of the neck is flat. In the middle neck vertebrae the front articulation processes, the prezygapophyses, lightly diverge. The humerus is relatively short compared to the radius, with 66% of its length. Classification Mistralazhdarcho was placed in the Azhdarchidae in 2018, without an exact cladistic analysis. The elevation on the symphysis shared with Alanqa suggests a close relationship between the two genera. Paleobiology Mistralazhdarcho is the first pterosaur named from the Campanian-Maastrichtian of Western Europe. Mistralazhdarcho possibly represents an intermediate size-class of European azhdarchids, in-between the smaller Eurazhdarcho with a wingspan of three metres and the giant form Hatzegopteryx.

It is an old game, being recorded as early as 1756 and its rules being first described in 1830\\\\.  Description  Sticheln has been described as \\"a very simple card game, which does not need exceptional mental agility to learn quickly - perhaps the reason why it counts so many friends.\\" It is similar to Whist, but played individually rather than in teams, using a shortened pack and a different scoring system. It is a 4-hander and is played either with a French-suited Piquet deck or German playing cards. Cards rank in their natural order: Ace/Sow, King, Queen/Ober, Jack/Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven. After cutting the pack to decide on the seating order and dealer will be, the dealer pays eight chips or coins to the pot. He then shuffles the pack and the player to his left cuts it. The bottom card of the top packet is turned as trumps – it belongs to the dealer – then each player is dealt eight cards in two packets of four in anti-clockwise order. Forehand leads to the first trick. Thereafter the trick winner leads to the next one. Players must follow suit, trump if unable, or play any card if they cannot follow or trump. Players must head the trick if possible. For each trick won, players receive one chip or coin from the pot. Forehand becomes the new dealer and pays his eight chips to the pot. The game continues either for a pre- agreed number of rounds (each round being 4 deals) or when one player reaches an agreed number of chips.  Other games called Sticheln  The name, Sticheln was also given to an unrelated game which was an historical variant of the gambling game, Zwicken. In 1993, a new game marketed as Sticheln was launched in Germany. It used proprietary cards and bore no resemblance to the original game of the same name.Tricked-Out! at islaythedragon.com.

The play was first performed in 1749 at a feast in honour of Stanisław Leszczyński in the castle of Lunéville and first published in 1759. Background The play was written just after Voltaire moved from Paris to the court of Lorraine with Émilie du Châtelet. Following his sensitive comedy Nanine, which had been influenced by Samuel Richardson, the focus was on the contrast between love marriages and the more usual money marriages of the middle class. A one-act version of the piece was found in Voltaire's literary estate after his death, which corresponds closely to the published three-act version. Voltaire revised the play for the Geneva edition which was published in 1775 by Cramer and Bardin. Action Jean-Michel Moreau: Illustration of Femme qui a raison, 1784 The action takes place in Paris in the house of Madame Duru in Rue Thévenot. The Marquis d'Outremont, to the delight of Madame Duru, asks for the hand of her daughter Erise and agrees to a wedding of his sister with Erise's brother Damis. However her husband M. Duru has been living in India for twelve years and has already planned a marriage between Erise and Damis with the children of wealthy mill owner M. Gripon. Gripon arrives with a letter from the father, saying that this wedding has to happen soon. Madame Duru does not care about her husband's wishes and organizes the wedding of the lovers the same evening. The following day, M. Gripon announces the imminent return of Madame Duru's husband. Duru himself has already arrived under an assumed name as a supposed friend of the landlord and can not cope in the general chaos. When he finally grasps the situation, he has an outburst of rage. His wife explains her sentimental reasons for disobeying. Finally, the servant Marthe reconciles the angry couple.Vgl. Valérie André: La Femme qui a raison, in: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, S. 83. Contemporary reception The comedy premiered in 1749 in the castle of Lunéville as an intermezzo during a festival in honor of Stanislaus I Leszczyński. According to Fréron, who relied on eyewitnesses, the performance was only received lukewarmly. The comedy was performed in Dijon, La Rochelle, Bordeaux and Marseille after this, but never brought to Paris. In 1758 there was a new production in the :fr:Théâtre de Carrouge in Geneva. The printed edition, published in 1759, was discussed and thoroughly critiqued by Fréron in volumes III and IV of the literary journal L'Année littéraire published by him. The marked the beginning of a furious quarrel between Voltaire and Fréron, which included a retaliation by Voltaire parodying his opponent in the character Fléron' in his 1760 comedy :fr:Le Café ou l'Écossaise. Printed editions  Some sources indicate that the first edition was printed by :fr:Gabriel Cramer and the second by Lambert. In fact this is incorrect; the first edition is by Lambert and the second is simply an unauthorised provincial copy.

Biography  Dalla Chiesa is the son of general Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, notable for campaigning against terrorism, and brother of TV presenter Rita dalla Chiesa and journalist and politician Simona dalla Chiesa. Dalla Chiesa graduated in Economics at the Bocconi University in Milan and became a University professor of Sociology of organized crime, Business management and communication and Sociology of the organization at the University of Milan. He is as well honorary president of Luigi Ciotti's Libera association.  Political career  In 1992, dalla Chiesa joined Leoluca Orlando's new-born left-wing party The Network, with which he is elected at the Chamber of Deputies in occasion of the 1992 general election. In 1993, in the local elections of that year, dalla Chiesa ran for the office of Mayor of Milan, supported by his party, by the Democratic Party of the Left, the Communist Refoundation Party and the Federation of the Greens. dalla Chiesa manages to reach the runoff, but is defeated by the Northern League candidate Marco Formentini. Dalla Chiesa is not re-elected at the Chamber in the 1994 election and decides to leave The Network. He manages to return to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1996 election, getting elected with the support of The Olive Tree coalition. When in 1998 the D'Alema I Cabinet swore in, dalla Chiesa refrained from voting for trust since the government was supported also by Francesco Cossiga with whom dalla Chiesa had a bad relationship, since he accused the former President of Italy of raising many malevolences against his father when Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa was Prefect in Palermo. In 2000 he became the coordinator in Lombardy of Arturo Parisi's The Democrats and in the 2001 election dalla Chiesa is elected to the Senate. In 2002, The Democrats and the Italian People's Party converged into The Daisy. Dalla Chiesa didn't run again for a parliamentary seat in the 2006 election, but after the win of The Union he is appointed Undersecretary for Universities and Scientific Research in the Prodi II Cabinet. In 2007, dalla Chiesa has been a member of the National Direction of the Democratic Party.  Writing career  Dalla Chiesa wrote several books and essays about politics and fight against organized crime in Italy. Among his most known works, there is the 1992 book Il giudice ragazzino (The Boy Judge, a tributary essay dedicated to Rosario Livatino, a young Sicilian judge who has been murdered by the Mafia in 1990. In telling the experience and the tragic end of Livatino, dalla Chiesa reconstructs his vision of the connection between the Mafia, politics and institutions in Sicily and Italy in the late 1980s, indicating the murder of the judge as one of the highest triumphs of criminal powers. The 1994 film Law of Courage is based on dalla Chiesa's book.  References   External links  *Official website *Files about his parliamentary activities (in Italian): XI, XIII, XIV legislature.

Since 1999 the area, falling within the municipal territory of Avezzano (Province of L'Aquila), has been included in the Mount Salviano Nature Reserve.  Description  Pietraquaria and Mount Velino from Salviano View of the Salviano pinewood A trail in Mount Salviano The Salviano mountain range is situated along the watershed between the Fucino basin and the Palentine Plains, in Marsica. In 1993 a serious fire burnt down dozens of hectares of black pine in the pinewood planted by the prisoners of Avezzano concentration camp in 1916. Ecological restoration, carried out through the reforestation of native and indigenous species, favoured the process of spontaneous regeneration consolidating the mountain area ecosystem. Since 1999, the Avezzano side entirely falls into the Mount Salviano Nature Reserve, a former peri-urban park. In 2005 Mount Salviano was indicated among Abruzzo sites of community importance.  Etymology  There are two hypotheses about the origin of the name \\"Salviano\\": the first links the toponym to the remarkable presence of Salvia officinalis on the mountain; the other traces it back to the finding of some epigraphs explicitly referring to the gens Salvia in the Marsican area.  View from the peak  From the Mount Salviano peak it is possible to admire the Mount Velino peaks in the north, the Palentine Plains in the west, and the Fucino basin, surrounded by the Marsican Mountains, in the east.

Biography Evelina 'Nina' Mount was the daughter of Henry Smith Mount, himself an artist and the older brother of the noted painter William Sidney Mount. Her father died when she was only four years old. She was raised in Stony Brook, New York, and her home and its environs provided the subject matter for many of her paintings. She was trained as a painter by her uncle William and later by James McDougal Hart, and she sometimes copied William's paintings. At least one painting formerly attributed to William has been deemed a copy by Evelina Mount. Mount is especially known for her floral still lifes but also painted landscapes. She exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York in the 1870s. Although she is considered Long Island's first professional woman artist, she sold very few if any of her paintings, but gave some of them away. Many of her surviving works are in the collection of the Long Island Museum.

Bauld (born 2 June 1970) is the Bruce and John Usher Chair of Public Health in The Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh. She also holds the CRUK/BUPA Chair in Behavioural Research for Cancer Prevention at Cancer Research UK.  Early life and education  Bauld was born in Edinburgh. Her parents emigrated to Canada from Scotland in 1979 when she was a child. She spent her teenage years on Vancouver Island. and attended Glenlyon Norfolk School in Victoria.https://old- friends.co/class.php?s=35514&c;=1988 https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/508876307/ She completed high school at the top of her graduating class (dux) in 1987 and was awarded a Governor General's Medal by the Province of British Columbia. She spent a year in Grenoble, France as an exchange student between 1987 and 1988. She completed her Bachelor's degree in Political Science at the University of Toronto in 1993. During her time as an undergraduate she was involved in the Hart House Debating Society and competed in public speaking and debating competitions in the USA and Canada. In 1991 she was awarded best individual debater at the North American Debating Championship. She earned her PhD in social policy at the University of Edinburgh.  Career and research After her PhD, Bauld joined the University of Kent as a postdoctoral fellow in 1997. Her postdoctoral role at Kent was in the Personal Social Services Research Unit where she worked with Professor Bleddyn Davies on the reform of health and social care for older people. She co-authored a book evaluating the community care reforms of the 1990s and served as research advisor to the Scottish Executive in the development of free personal care for older people in Scotland.https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2002/06/26/news-analysis-of-free- personal-care-in-scotland/ In 1998, while still at Kent, her research moved from a focus on older people and end of life services to the primary prevention of conditions that could cause disability and early mortality in later life. She conducted the first evaluation of National Health Service (NHS) smoking cessation services, which were at the time unique in the world as free at the point of use services for smokers who wanted to quit . Subsequently she joined the Department of Social Policy at the University of Glasgow as a Lecturer in 2000. At the University of Glasgow she continued to build a research portfolio in prevention and public health and contributed to several national evaluations of area-based initiatives including Health Action Zones and the New Deal for Communities. In 2006 Bauld moved to the University of Bath where she was appointed as Reader and subsequently Professor and Head of Department of Social and Policy Sciences. Also in 2006, Bauld was made the Government of the United Kingdom's scientific adviser on tobacco control, and held this position until 2010. In more recent research her focus has remained on the leading preventable causes of Non-Communicable Diseases, particularly cancer. She explored whether financial incentives could be used to support smokers to quit. She campaigned to help women to stop smoking during pregnancy. Bauld found that NHS approaches to smoking cessation were effective in helping smokers to quit, and that group treatment can be more effective than one-to-one. She found that younger, more deprived and pregnant smokers had the lowest quit rates. Since 2011 she has chaired the multi-agency smoking pregnancy challenge group. She joined the University of Stirling in 2011. In 2013 she led Health First, an independent alcohol strategy for the UK. The strategy examined approaches to addressing harmful alcohol consumption in the UK and called for tougher restriction on alcohol marketing. It also highlighted the importance of empowering licensing authorities, who could control alcohol availability in their jurisdiction. From 2008 she helped establish the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies, involving 9 Universities, which subsequently expanded to include alcohol policy and she became Deputy Director at the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies (UKCTAS), a Consortium involving 13 Universities, in 2014. In 2014 Bauld was appointed as Cancer Research UK's Prevention Champion. This role works across preventable risk factors for cancer in the UK and further afield. Along with colleagues at CRUK, UKCTAS and Public Health England, she established the UK Electronic Cigarette Research Forum in 2016. She is interested in the evaluation of complex public health interventions and how they can inform health policy. She has conducted research on overweight and obesity, tobacco control, drug and alcohol use and inequalities in health. During the Covid-19 pandemic she was a regular contributor to UK and international media debate on public health responses needed to address it. https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh- friends/supplements/meet-behavioural-scientist-guiding-through- covid19https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-in-scotland-uk- appalling-at-dealing-with-crisis-but-sturgeon-talks-about-it- well-7ngz0lznkhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/once-the-center-of-the-coronavirus- crisis-europe-now-looks-ahead-with-hope-11593095341 She is the principal investigator of the Tobacco Control Capacity Programme, a global challenge research fund and Cancer Research UK supported program in south Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa. She also leads the SPECTRUM Consortium, the successor to UKCTAS, which involves 10 Universities and the main public health agencies in the UK as well as multi-agency alliances including the Obesity Health Alliance, the Alcohol Health Alliance and the Smokefree Action Coalition. Bauld joined the University of Edinburgh in August 2018. She serves as Bruce and John Usher Chair of Public Health at The Usher Institute. The Bruce and John Usher Chair is the oldest Professorship of Public Health in the UK. It was jointly endowed following donations by Alexander Low Bruce and family, and the proprietors of William Younger’s brewery, and Sir John Usher of Usher’s distillery.

He is particularly known for his work in Nuremberg, Germany and he is credited with designing some of the earliest bastion fortifications north of the Alps. He is the earliest known notable Maltese architect. Career Little information is known about Falzon, and his date of birth is not recorded. Falzon might have met Antonio Ferramolino, an Italian military engineer in the service of Emperor Charles V, during his visit to Malta in 1535. He might have accompanied him to Sicily, where Ferramolino was building the fortifications of Messina. Falzon probably traveled to the Holy Roman Empire after Ferramolino left Sicily for the Republic of Ragusa in 1537–38. The earliest known historical reference to him is a series of interviews dated 25 to 29 April 1538, when he introduced himself to council members of the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg as a skilled artist, architect and site foreman who had previously worked in the service of Charles V. The councilors were impressed at Falzon's expertise in military engineering, especially since he was familiar with the Italian system of bastion fortifications which had revolutionized European military architecture. Soon afterwards he was commissioned to design improvements to the city walls of Nuremberg and the Lichtenau Fortress. Work on the (also called Fazuni-Bastion after the architect) in the vicinity of the Nuremberg Castle began by July 1538 and were completed in late 1544 or 1545, and they are possibly the earliest example of bastioned fortifications in the Italian style ever to be built north of the Alps. Falzon designed other parts of the Nuremberg city walls in 1546, and he also designed gates or fortifications in the towns of Lauf an der Pegnitz, Hiltpoltstein and Hersbruck. Ruins of the Ottheinrichsbau at Heidelberg Castle, possibly designed by Falzon in the 1550s The last recorded reference to Falzon is in a report dated 21 April 1555, when he requested money from the city council members after being robbed in Italy. The councilors provided financial assistance but stated that at the time they did not have any work for him. It remains unknown if Falzon returned to Nuremberg, or went to Italy or Malta, but he is not mentioned in any later records. It has been speculated that he went to the Electoral Palatinate where he might have designed the Ottheinrichsbau at Heidelberg Castle, although there is no direct evidence supporting this attribution. The Piast Castle, which was built in 1547–53 in the Duchy of Brzeg and is now part of Poland, is sometimes also attributed to Falzon due to stylistic similarities with the Ottheinrichsbau. The architect of the Piastenschloss is recorded as being an Italian named Antonio di Teodoro, possibly referring to Falzon. Some German historians refer to Falzon as a Renaissance man due to his interest in multiple areas. He seems to have been capable of designing and making tools and instruments, and he is also credited with introducing cornerstone medals (a medal commemorating the construction of a new building) into Germany during his work on the Nuremberg fortifications. Falzon's attempts to extend his activities into areas other than military engineering resulted in disputes with the city's powerful guilds. He is also known to have had a number of disputes or clashes with the authorities or his workers, and he was described as being arrogant. Legacy Falzon is the earliest known notable Maltese architect, preceding better-known figures such as Girolamo Cassar and Tommaso Dingli. He was overlooked by Maltese historians until the early 21st century, probably since most documents referring to him can only be found in German archives and libraries. Many German historians identified Falzon as being Italian, but he referred to himself as being Maltese, and Falzon was the surname of a Maltese noble family. His surname is rendered in many different variants in German archival sources, including Faissant, Fazuni, Vazuni, Falsone, Vascani and Faggioni, and his real name likely was Falzon or Fauczun.

It is Uzbekistan's longest external boundary. The Uzbek capital Tashkent is situated just from this border. Map of Uzbekistan with Kazakhstan to the north Description The border begins in the west at the tripoint with Turkmenistan; it then follows the 56th meridian east for about up to the 45th parallel north. There a straight line of goes north-east, followed by another straight line section of . This latter section cuts through the Aral Sea and the former Vozrozhdeniya Island (now part of the mainland) which straddle the boundary; the sea was formerly much larger but was severely depleted by Soviet-era irrigation schemes. The central section of the boundary consists of a series of short straight line segments going roughly eastwards through the Kyzylkum Desert, down to the vicinity of Kazakhstan's Chardara Dam. The border then follows a u-shape at Kazakhstan's Maktaaral District before proceeding in a roughly north-eastwards direction past Tashkent and then along the Ugam Range to the Kyrgyz tripoint. The western two-thirds of the border are sparsely populated and traverse largely desert areas, in stark contrast to the eastern third which is densely populated, containing some of the largest towns in Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan. The easternmost section is mountainous and contains a series of national parks (Sayram-Ugam National Park and Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan and Ugam-Chatkal National Park in Uzbekistan). Uzbekistan's Jizzakh to Sirdaryo railway crosses through Kazakhstan briefly, a legacy of the Soviet era where infrastructure was built without regard to what were then internal boundaries. History The Russian Empire had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century, by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin’s definition of a nation as being \\"a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture\\". The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan- stalins-deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis- and-russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalism,Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40 as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‘correct’ ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore, NTD also aimed to create ‘viable’ entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 112 The attempt to balance these contradictory aims within an overall nationalist framework proved exceedingly difficult and often impossible, resulting in the drawing of often tortuously convoluted borders, multiple enclaves and the unavoidable creation of large minorities who ended up living in the ‘wrong’ republic. Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers as they are today.

(2011) Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 105 At this time Central Asia consisted of two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR: the Turkestan ASSR, created in April 1918 and covering large parts of what are now southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Turkmenistan, and the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kirghiz ASSR, Kirgizistan ASSR on the map), which was created on 26 August 1920 in the territory roughly coinciding with the northern part of today's Kazakhstan (at this time Kazakhs were referred to as ‘Kyrgyz’ and what are now the Kyrgyz were deemed a sub- group of the Kazakhs and referred to as ‘Kara-Kyrgyz’ i.e. mountain-dwelling ‘black-Kyrgyz’). There were also the two separate successor ‘republics’ of the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva, which were transformed into the Bukhara and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics following the takeover by the Red Army in 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39 On 25 February 1924 the Politburo and Central Committee of the Soviet Union announced that it would proceed with NTD in Central Asia.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 55Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 42 The process was to be overseen by a Special Committee of the Central Asian Bureau, with three sub-committees for each of what were deemed to be the main nationalities of the region (Kazakhs, Turkmen and Uzbeks), with work then exceedingly rapidly.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 54Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 52-3Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 92Starr, S.

Given the at-best weak sense of Karakalpak nationality, and their perceived closer links to the Kazakhs, they were given their own Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast within the Kazakh ASSR.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 172, 177Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 275 This oblast was larger than the modern autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and extended considerably further eastwards, thereby cutting the Uzbek SSR in two, with a small exclave around Khiva. Poor economic performance in the oblast convinced Soviet leaders that Karakalpakstan should be included directly the Russian SSR, a move formalised in 1930; it was upgraded to ASSR status in 1932. In 1936 the area was transferred to the Uzbek SSR. Map of Uzbekistan from 1940, showing slight differences in the border It appears that there were various small changes to the border in the following decades. Many older maps show a slightly different boundary in the Kara-Kum desert, with a large triangular protrusion of Uzbek territory into what is now Kazakhstan's Kyzylorda Region (see map right). The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. There were various tensions around the border – especially in the Tashkent area - in the late 1990s-early 2000s, with Kazakhstan accusing Uzbekistan of unilaterally demarcating and militarising the border; eventually in 2001 the two governments agreed to begin a full delimitation of the border. Full demarcation is currently ongoing.

During World War II it served in the Norwegian Campaign, defended Gibraltar and the D-Day invasion ports, and took part in Operation Diver against the V-1 flying bombs. Origin The regiment was formed in Essex 1 October 1938 as part of the expansion of Britain's anti-aircraft (AA) defences in the period of tension before World War II. 82nd AA Brigade (like all Royal Artillery (RA) AA brigades it was redesignated as a 'regiment' on 1 January 1939), and it gained its 'Essex' subtitle the following year) comprised a regimental headquarters (RHQ) at Barking and three batteries:Frederick, pp. 754–6, 776.Litchfield, pp. 71–2. * 156 (Barking) AA Battery at Barking; transferred from 52nd (London) AA Regiment, one of the first TA AA regiments, raised in 1922 * 193 AA Battery at Leigh-on-Sea; transferred from 59th (Essex Regiment) AA Regiment, itself converted from 7th Battalion Essex Regiment in 1935 * 256 (Barking) AA Battery newly-raised at Barking The regiment was under the command of Brevet Colonel G. Shenstone, formerly of the 7th Bn Essex Regiment.Monthly Army List, May 1939. Its Essex subtitle was added in July 1939 World War II Mobilisation In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment formed part of 37th Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 6th AA Division covering South East England.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. Norway In April 1940, 6 AA Brigade was organised to provide AA cover for the Allied force sent to Norway. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment, with 24 3.7-inch guns, was selected to join this formation, but like all the other AA units it was short of instruments and towing vehicles.Derry, Appendix B.Farndale, p. 27.Farndale, Annex C.Joslen, p. 461.Routledge, p. 109. 193 AA Battery of 82nd HAA Rgt, together with a Light AA (LAA) battery, was assigned to 146th Infantry Brigade, which had landed at Namsos 16–18 April as part of 'Mauriceforce'. However, only the first LAA guns had arrived by 29 April, when it was decided to evacuate the heavily-bombed infantry.Derry, pp. 88–90, 139–42.Farndale, p. 28.Shakespeare, pp. 100–2. For the main attack on Narvik, AA guns were landed at Harstad, an island base just outside Narvikfjord with an anchorage, and an airstrip at Skånland on the opposite coast. Initial AA defence was provided by LAA guns, joined in May by 193/82nd HAA Bty with eight 3.7-inch guns. To enable the RAF to operate fighters, these guns were to be based at Bardufoss Air Station on the mainland, a remote site where packed ice had to be blasted clear before the guns could be emplaced. A small supply port was established for the Bardufoss force at Sorreisa, near Tromsø. 6 AA Brigade had to provide AA defence for all these sites, and for a blocking force to be put ashore at Bodo on the mainland to the south. In addition, the French combat groups along Narvikfjord were being strafed and needed AA cover.Routledge, pp. 110–2.Derry, pp. 148–50. When the rest of 82nd AA Rgt arrived on 10 May, Brigade HQ allocated one battery to Bardufoss and another to Tromsø and Sorreisa. (The four guns at Tromsø, the temporary seat of the Norwegian government, represented the furthest northward British deployment.) These deployments were gradually carried out during May. All movements had to be carried our along steep narrow roads banked with six feet of snow, or on boats that could not take a 3.7-inch gun.Derry, p. 201. The Luftwaffe concentrated its air attacks on the AA defences. With high mountains and low cloud, early warning cover was poor, with just a single RAF radar post on the Lofoten Islands, and the Army AA units had to rely on radar- equipped warships, which provided most of the AA cover in Narvikfjord. Bardufoss Airfield opened on 21 May and the final assault on Narvik by French, Polish and Norwegian troops began on 27 May. However, immediately after its capture, orders were received to destroy the port and evacuate to the UK. (The British Expeditionary Force was simultaneously being evacuated from Dunkirk). To cover the evacuation, AA units were ordered to maintain maximum activity and especially to prevent reconnaissance overflights. A the same time, 6 AA Bde was ordered by London to recover its 3.7-inch and 40mm Bofors guns as a matter of priority. This was done by progressively thinning out defences, and the brigade was able to assemble from the outlying positions 22 Bofors and five HAA guns at Hardstad, with a number of predictors and heightfinders. Although much of the force's equipment was saved, the AA guns were kept in action until 6 June to cover the evacuation. and many had to be abandoned when the last troopship left on 8 June.Derry, pp. 172, 220–2. Gibraltar Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed at White Rock Battery, November 1941. AA units returning from France and Norway were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped where possible, and redeployed for future integration into existing defence plans. On 1 June, those AA regiments equipped with 3-inch guns or the newer 3.7-inch were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. 82nd (Essex) HAA Regiment was re-equipped with 16 x 3.7-inch guns, 8 x Bofors guns and GL Mk I gun- laying radar, and was then sent aboard the SS City of Cairo to reinforce the defences of Gibraltar.Farndale, p. 98. On the outbreak of war in September 1939 there had only been two batteries (9 and 19 AA Btys) manning the totally inadequate AA defences of Gibraltar, which consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns to protect the Royal Navy Dockyard, with the assistance of Royal Navy (RN) 2-pounder pom-pom guns. 10th AA Rgt was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new Gibraltar Defence Force (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the 'Phoney war' period.Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.Routledge, pp. 201–4.Rankin, p. 153. After the Fall of France, a group of AA detachments under 53rd (City of London) AA Rgt escaped from Marseilles aboard the SS Alma Dawson. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2343.Joslen, pp. 552–3. There followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to Malta in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of Operation Coat, a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up. The Gibraltar Defence Force training on a 3.7-inch gun. The first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the Vichy French Air Force in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir on 3 July (Operation Catapult), which had been carried out by Force H from Gibraltar.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130–37, 142.Rankin, pp. 1–7.Smith, pp. 57–88. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber during a raid by the Italian Regia Aeronautica. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and Free French attack on Dakar (Operation Menace), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.Farndale, pp. 200–1.Rankin, pp. 295–9. Searchlights over Gibraltar during an air raid practice on 20 November 1942. A new 13th HAA Rgt HQ was formed in Gibraltar in March 1941 to replace the absent 10th and take over the newly-arrived 228 (Edinburgh) HAA Bty and the radar troop.Routledge, Table XXXIV, p. 212. Additional guns and GL radar sets arrived by May, and in September 1941 15 AA Bde HQ was formed to coordinate all AA defences and integrate them into the plans against invasion by sea or land. The revised layout could bring the fire of 20 HAA guns to bear on a target approaching at a speed of 240 mph from any direction at a typical height of 12,000 feet. Each AA gunsite was also given an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for self-defence. Static 3.7-inch HAA guns preserved at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar. During 1941 there were five air raids that were positively identified as Vichy French, another six were attributed to Italian aircraft. A total of nine 'kills' were claimed with one 'probable', though the Vichy and Italian HQs announced higher losses than these, so some aircraft probably crashed in Spain or elsewhere. Throughout 1942, raiding was spasmodic and in small strength, most enemy sorties being confined to high level reconnaissance overflights, including German Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft from March 1942. There were occasional Italian raids on moonlit nights, generally of three Savoia bombers flying at medium height. On 29 June the Royal Air Force early warning radar detected one such raid at a range of 60 miles, which was duly picked up by GL radar as the aircraft turned towards the Rock. One aircraft was illuminated by searchlight and shot down, the others were engaged with barrage fire by the HAA guns and Z battery rockets. Although Gibraltar's North Airfield was bombed and casualties suffered, two more of the hostile raiders were shot down and crashed in Spain. During the whole of 1942 there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash-landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943. 228 HAA Battery joined the regiment when 13th HAA Rgt HQ was disbanded in November 1942. 175th HAA Rgt (375, 386, 441 HAA Btys) arrived in Gibraltar in May 1943 to relieve 82nd HAA Rgt, which embarked with 156, 193 and 256 HAA Btys on 30 May to return to Home Forces in the UK, leaving 228 HAA Bty with 175th HAA Rgt. Home Defence On return to AA Command, 82nd HAA Rgt joined 35 AA Bde in 2 AA Group covering South East England. It was rejoined by 228 HAA Bty from Gibraltar in October 1943.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84. Early in 1944, 35 AA Bde came under command of 6 AA Group. This was a headquarters that had been moved from Scotland to the South Coast to take responsibility for the build-up of AA defences in the Solent–Portsmouth area covering embarkation ports for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). In March 1944, 44 AA Bde HQ moved down from Manchester to join 6 AA Group and take over the AA defences on the Isle of Wight covering the Solent, including 82nd HAA Rgt. Shipping at Portsmouth was bombed on four successive nights (25–28 April) during the 'Baby Blitz' of early 1944, and there were sporadic attacks in May, but these failed to disrupt the 'Overlord' preparations.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85.44 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 166/14657.Pile's despatch.Routledge pp. 408–21.Collier, Appendix XLII. 82nd HAA Regiment moved in early May to join 60 AA Bde in 3 AA Group, covering the invasion ports on the South West Coast. Operation Diver 3.7-inch HAA battery in action near London 29 August 1944 The invasion of Normandy was launched on 6 June. A week after D-Day the long-awaited attacks on London by V-1 flying bombs ('Divers') began. AA Command had prepared Operation Diver to counter these weapons, and AA guns were moved from all over the UK to strengthen the 'Diver Belt' in Southern England. In early August 82nd HAA Rgt moved to join 26 (London) AA Bde in 3 AA Group, covering London itself. V-1 slung under the wing of a Heinkel He 111 bomber. As 21st Army Group overran the main launch sites in the Pas-de-Calais, the Luftwaffe shifted its focus to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea during the autumn. Once again AA Command redeployed units in response, this time to Eastern England. New HAA sites had to be quickly established, with static guns mounted on ingenious 'Pile Platforms' (named after the commander of AA Command, Sir Frederick Pile) and thousands of huts moved and re-erected to shelter the crews as winter approached. AA Command formed a new 9 AA Group to take over the 'Diver' defences in East Anglia and in early December 1944 82nd HAA Rgt rejoined 37 AA Bde in this group. AA Command was rapidly wound down after VE Day. By September 1945, 9 AA Group had gone and 37 AA Bde was back in 1 AA Group. 82nd HAA Regiment remained with it, but 228 HAA Bty had transferred within the brigade to 143rd HAA RgtOrder of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. Postwar 63 HAA Regiment The war service personnel of 82 HAA Rgt continued under the old regimental and battery numbers until 1 April 1947 when they were redesignated 63 HAA Regiment in the Regular Army with the batteries reorganised as follows:Frederick, p. 955. * 156 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 22 Coast Bty, renumbered as 91 HAA Bty * 193 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 25 Coast Bty, renumbered as 194 HAA Bty * 306 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 30 Coast Bty, renumbered as 220 HAA Bty The regiment was assigned to 11 AA Bde, a Regular brigade in AA Command's 1 AA Group.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441. This regiment and its batteries were placed in suspended animation at Shoeburyness on 2 June 1955 and officially disbanded on 1 January 1962, except 91 Bty, which later served in 72 LAA Rgt. 482 (Essex) HAA Regiment The TA regiment was officially placed in suspended animation on 1 January 1947 at South Benfleet in Essex and concurrently reformed as 482 (Mixed) HAA Regiment RA (Essex) at Barking as part of 52 (London) AA Bde ('Mixed' denoting that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the regiment).Frederick, p. 1017.Farndale, Annex M.474–519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. The regiment was assigned to 55 (East Anglian) AA Bde in 1 AA Group. However, 55 AA Bde was disbanded the following year, completely disappearing in September 1948.Frederck, p. 1050. When AA Command was disbanded in March 1955, there were wholesale mergers among its component units. 482 (Essex) HAA Rgt was amalgamated with 459 (Essex Regiment), 599 and 600 HAA Rgts into a new 459 (Essex) HAA Rgt – 459 was the old 59 (Essex Regiment), the original parent of 193 Bty, and 599 and 600 were also Essex Regiment conversions that had been in 26 (London) AA Bde, the predecessor of 52 AA Bde. The new regiment subsequently underwent a series of further mergers with East London units in the 1960s, and the Essex lineage was discontinued.Litchfield, pp. 70–4.444–473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.592–638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. Uniforms and insignia During its stay in Gibraltar the regiment adopted an arm badge consisting of the Key of Gibraltar flanked by two 'A's, embroidered in yellow on a red upright rectangle. This badge continued to be worn by 482 (Essex) HAA Rgt until 1955. Honorary Colonel Retired Major J.D. Sherwood was appointed Honorary Colonel of 82nd AA Rgt on 8 March 1939.

The three Conway brothers: Sam (vocals, guitar), Max (vocals, guitar) and Riley (drums), were all previously members of an indie and alternative rock quartet, Rubycon, with Reuben Styles (later of Peking Duk). Slow Turismo released their debut extended play in July 2015 and have followed with singles. The group have toured Australia.  History  The three Conway brothers, Sam (vocals, guitar), Max (vocals, guitar) and Riley (drums), formed Slow Turismo as an indie pop group with Louis Montgomery on bass guitar and Rhys Lintern on percussion and trumpet. By July 2015 they were down to a four piece with the departure of Lintern. The Conways' previous group, Rubycon, were formed in 2007 as an indie and alternative rock band when Reuben Styles (bass guitar) joined. The name Rubycon came from taking Reuben's first name, and the Conways' last. The band performed gigs around Canberra. After entering the 2007 National Campus Band Competition, Rubycon came in second place behind, Will Stoker and the Embers, gaining a large fan base in their home town of Canberra, and Australia-wide. In 2008 Rubycon again won the ACT heats of the same competition and went on to take out first place in the National Finals of the competition. Some of the prizes included a cheque for $3000, recording time, CDs pressed, and an Australian tour worth $8000. Reuben Styles formed electronic duo, Peking Duk, in 2010. In 2014 Slow Turismo released two singles, \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Thunderstorm\\" followed by a five-track self-titled extended play in July 2015, which Ian McCarthy of BMA Magazine previewed, \\"with an infantry of blissfully intricate indie-pop tunes and some of the tightest, most fun live performances.\\" \\"Falter\\" was their follow up single later that year, with Susie Garrard of Happy observing, \\"[it] does quite the opposite of its namesake and seems to move purposefully forward with all the hallmarks of a band growing in confidence and maturity.\\" They issued another single, \\"You Were Dead\\", in late 2016, which Pilerats Hayden Davies felt was, \\"evidently far more laid-back, with summery guitar riffs that glisten underneath hushed vocals from the band’s frontman, and the occasional backing vocal from the SAFIA frontman himself.\\" The single was produced by Ben Woolner of Safia.

He specialized in the reliability of complex electronic systems and micro- and nanoelectronic components. He was awarded the \\"Tudor Tănăsescu\\" prize by the Romanian Academy. Biography The father, Ioan T. Băjenescu (September 17, 1899, Redea, Romanaţi, Romania – November 17, 1987, Craiova, Dolj, county, Romania), was transmission information Colonel of the Romanian Royal Army, Commander of the Cluj-Napoca Transmission Regiment. It first emitted amateur radio signals using the call sign CV5BI, then YR5BI. In March 1926, with Dr. Alexandru Savopol, he laid the foundations for the first radio club in Romania, in Craiova.YO7KAJ, History of the Radioamateur Activity in Craiova City, visited on July 17, 2018 Together they built Romania's first short-wave Radio station and (in 1926) the first short-wave radio broadcast in Romania. Together with Dr. Alexandru Savopol, October 26, 1926, Second Lieutenant Ioan T. Băjenescu produced the first radio program in Romania for the general public; the program was heard throughout the territory of Oltenia and many echoes appeared in the press in all the cities of Oltenia, and even of the Timok Valley (Bulgaria). The mother, Lelia Constanţa (born May 21, 1908, Corlate, Romania; deceased December 15, 1980, Craiova, Romania), born Petrescu, was the first radio amateur woman in Romania, using her husband's call-sign YL CV5BI. Fluent in French and German, she established tens of thousands of radio links on all meridians. Unfortunately, of these QSL (which have been collected over the years as evidence of these radio links) there remains almost nothing, since, immediately after the establishment of the communist regime, they were all burned, as they were evidence of \\"links with enemies\\" outside the country. His wife, Andrea, born Bogdan (born July 3, 1937), granddaughter of the academic professor Dr. Petru Bogdan, from the University of Iassy, founder of higher education in physical chemistry in Romania, is an electronics engineer. She built the first phonetics laboratory at the University of Bucharest. After emigrating to Switzerland, she worked for four years as an engineer at Brown Boveri in the automation department.

SimArt, Craiova, 2011, pp. 58–78; after the inauguration of the hall, local and central newspapers wrote that the acoustics of the concert hall were one of the most successful in South-Eastern Europe. Although he wanted to become a sound engineer at the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company, the political barriers specific to this period did not allow him to realize his dream. Professional activity Thanks to very good results at the diploma examination, he was appointed researcher at the Research Institute for Signals of the Romanian Army (1956–1960) then he won a competition and became researcher – later principal researcher – at the Institute of Energy of the Romanian Academy (1960–1968) where, under the direction of the eminent scientist Vasile-Mihai Popov, correspondent member of the Romanian Academy, he built the largest analogue machines in Romania: MECAN I and MECAN II.

It was located on a hill called Solygeius (Σολύγειος) located 12 stadia from the shore, and dominated the coast between two promontories called Chersonesus and Rheitus.  History  Finds from Solygeia According to Thucydides, Dorians had seized the hill on which Solygeia sat, in order to carry on war against the Aeolian inhabitants of Corinthians. During the Peloponnesian War, in the year 425 BCE, Solygeia was the scene of a confrontation between Athens and Corinth. The Athenians had undertaken an expedition against Corinth led by, among others, Nicias, with 80 triremes, 2000 hoplites, and 200 horsemen. They were accompanied by allies from Miletus, Andros and Carystus and landed in the territory dominated by Solygeia. The Corinthians, having had early intimation from Argos of the intended invasion, came in good time to the defense. The Corinthians, led by Battus and Lycophron, went to protect the village of Solygeia, which had no walls, and attacked the Athenians. After a long confrontation in which the Corinthians took the worst part, reinforcements arrived in support of the Corinthians and the Athenians were forced to re- embark. Thucydides offers a balance of 212 dead among the Corinthians, including Lycophron, and about 50 among the Athenians. According to Polyaenus, the Athenians employed a ploy consisting of first disembarking a part of their troops who hid and when the Corinthians came to try to avoid the disembarkation of the others, those who had disembarked ambushed the Corinthians opposing the remainder of the landings, causing great losses to the Corinthians.]Polyaenus 1.39.

Kazakhstan's Taraz to Aktobe railway crosses through Kyrgyzstan briefly, a legacy of the Soviet era where infrastructure was built without regard to what were then internal boundaries. History Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century, by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin's definition of a nation as being “a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture”. The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalism,Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40 as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‘correct’ ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore, NTD also aimed to create ‘viable’ entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 112 The attempt to balance these contradictory aims within an overall nationalist framework proved exceedingly difficult and often impossible, resulting in the drawing of often tortuously convoluted borders, multiple enclaves and the unavoidable creation of large minorities who ended up living in the ‘wrong’ republic. Additionally the Soviets never intended for these borders to become international frontiers as they are today. Soviet Central Asia in 1922 before national delimitation NTD of the area along ethnic lines had been proposed as early as 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 40-1Starr, S. Frederick (ed.) (2011) Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 105 At this time Central Asia consisted of two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR: the Turkestan ASSR, created in April 1918 and covering large parts of what are now southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Turkmenistan), and the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Kirghiz ASSR, Kirgizistan ASSR on the map), which was created on 26 August 1920 in the territory roughly coinciding with the northern part of today's Kazakhstan (at this time Kazakhs were referred to as ‘Kyrgyz’ and what are now the Kyrgyz were deemed a sub- group of the Kazakhs and referred to as ‘Kara-Kyrgyz’ i.e. mountain-dwelling ‘black-Kyrgyz’). There were also the two separate successor ‘republics’ of the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva, which were transformed into the Bukhara and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics following the takeover by the Red Army in 1920.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39 On 25 February 1924 the Politburo and Central Committee of the Soviet Union announced that it would proceed with NTD in Central Asia.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 55Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 42 The process was to be overseen by a Special Committee of the Central Asian Bureau, with three sub-committees for each of what were deemed to be the main nationalities of the region (Kazakhs, Turkmen and Uzbeks), with work then exceedingly rapidly.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 54Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 52-3Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 92Starr, S.

(2011) Ferghana Valley – the Heart of Central Asia Routledge, pg. 106Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 271-2 There were initial plans to possibly keep the Khorezm and Bukhara PSRs, however it was eventually decided to partition them in April 1924, over the often vocal opposition of their Communist Parties (the Khorezm Communists in particular were reluctant to destroy their PSR and had to be strong-armed into voting for their own dissolution in July of that year).Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 56-8 The creation of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border was hampered by disputes over whether the Kyrgyz (then called ‘Kara-Kirghiz’) were a separate people from the Kazakhs (then called ‘Kirghiz’), or just Kazakhs who happened to be semi-nomadic dwellers of mountainous regions.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 168 It was decided that the Kara-Kirghiz (Kyrgyz) were different enough to warrant the creation of an Autonomous Oblast within the Russia SSR in October 1924, with borders matching those of modern Kyrgyzstan. In 1925 it was renamed the Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast in May 1925, then became the Kirghiz ASSR in 1926 (not to be confused with the Kirghiz ASSR that was the first name of Kazak ASSR), and finally it became the Kirghiz SSR in 1936.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 167 The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. The two countries began work on demarcating their common boundary in the 1990s and 2000s in a spirit of cooperation that contrasts starkly with much of the other ex-Soviet Central Asian states. A final border treaty was signed on 15 December 2001, entering into force in 2008, with the border being demarcated on the ground in the following years.

View of Hadrian's aqueduct. Stymphalus or Stymphalos (), or Stymphelus or Stymphelos (Στύμφηλος), or Stymphelum or Stymphelon (Στύμφηλον),Schol. ad Pind. Ol. 6.129 or Stymphalum, or Stymphala,Lucret. 5.31 was a town in the northeast of ancient Arcadia. Location The territory of Stymphalus is a plain, about six miles (10 km) in length, bounded by Achaea on the north, Sicyonia and Phliasia on the east, the territory of Mantineia on the south, and that of Orchomenus and Pheneus on the west This plain is shut in on all sides by mountains. On the north rises the gigantic mass of Cyllene, from which a projecting spur, called Mount Stymphalus (Στυμφαλος ὄρος), descends into the plain.Hesych. sub voce nivalis Stymphalus; Statius Silv. 4.6.100. The mountain at the southern end of the plain, opposite Cyllene, was called Apelaurum (τὸ Ἀπέλαυρον), and at its foot is the subterranean outlet of the lake of Stymphalus (ἡ Στυμφαλὶς λίμνη or ἡ Στυμφηλίη λίμνη). This lake is formed partly by the rain-water descending from Cyllene and Apelaurum, and partly by three streams which flow into it from different parts of the plain. From the west descends a small stream, which rises in Mount Geronteium in the neighbourhood of Kastanía; and from the east comes another stream, which rises near Dusa. But the most important of the three streams is the one which rises on the northern side of the plain, from a copious subterranean outlet; this stream was called Stymphalus by the ancients; it was regarded by them as the principal source of the lake, and was universally believed to make its reappearance, after a subterranean course of 200 stadia, as the river Erasinus in Argolis, 2.24.6, 8.22.3; The Stymphalii worshiped the Erasinus and Metope (Μετώπη),Aelian V.H. 2.33. whence it has been concluded that Metope is only another name of the river Stymphalus. Metope is also mentioned by Callimachus,Callimachus, Jov. 26. with the epithet πολύστειος ('pebbly'). The water, which formed the source of the Stymphalus, was conducted to Corinth by the emperor Hadrian, by means of an aqueduct, of which considerable remains may still be traced. Pausanias reported that the lake dried in summer; however, as there is no outlet for the waters of the lake except the subterranean outlet, a stoppage of this channel by stones, sand, or any other substance occasions an inundation. In the time of Pausanias (2nd century) there occurred such an inundation, which was ascribed to the anger of Artemis. The water was said to have covered the plain to the extent of 400 stadia; but this number is evidently corrupt, and we ought probably to read τεσσαράκοντα ('forty') instead of τετρακοσίους ('four hundred'). Strabo relates that Iphicrates, when besieging Stymphalus without success, attempted to obstruct the outlet, but was diverted from his purpose by a sign from heaven. Strabo also states that originally there was no subterranean outlet for the waters of the lake, so that the city, which was in his time 50 stadia from the lake, was originally situated upon its margin. But this is clearly an error, even if his statement refers to old Stymphalus, for the breadth of the whole lake is less than 20 stadia. History The city derived its name from Stymphalus, a son of Elatus and grandson of Arcas; but the ancient city, in which Temenus, the son of Pelasgus, dwelt, had entirely disappeared in the time of Pausanias, and all that he could learn respecting it was, that Hera was formerly worshiped there in three different sanctuaries - as virgin, wife, and widow. The modern city lay upon the southern edge of the lake, about a mile and a half (2.5 km) from the outlet, and upon a rocky promontory connected with the mountains behind. Stymphalus is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad, and also by Pindar,Pindar O. 6.169. who calls it the mother of Arcadia. Its name does not often occur in the ancient historians, and it owes its chief importance to its being situated upon one of the most frequented routes leading to the westward from Argolis and Corinth. It was taken by Apollonides, a general of Cassander, and subsequently belonged to the Achaean League. In the time of Pausanias it was included in Argolis. The only building of the city mentioned by Pausanias, was a temple of Artemis Stymphalia, under the roof of which were figures of the Stymphalian birds; while behind the temple stood statues of white marble, representing young women with the legs and thighs of birds. These birds, so celebrated in mythology, the destruction of which was one of the labours of Heracles, are said by Pausanias to be as large as cranes. but resembling in form the ibis, only that they have stronger beaks, and not crooked like those of the ibis. On some of the coins of Stymphalus, they are represented exactly in accordance with the description of Pausanias. Pindar mentions an Olympic victor in the mule-cart race (a man called Hagesias) in his sixth Olympian Ode, and urges the members of the choir to venerate their virginal Hera, who was apparently a survival of pre-Olympian religion. Pausanias mentions a statue of Dromeus, a long-distance runner from Stymphalus who won at twice at the Dolichos at the Panhellenic Games in 484 BCE and 480 BCE. The temple of Artemis seems still to have been in use in Roman times. One unusual aspect of the goddess is that her sanctuary is referred to in an inscription of the early 2nd century BCE as that of Brauronian Artemis, an Athenian cult. An inscription commemorating Stymphalian hospitality to the people of Elateia was to be set up in the agora of Elateia and in the sanctuary of Brauronian Artemis at Stymphalus. Cults of Demeter and Hermes are also epigraphically attested. Archaeology Archaeological site Its site is located near the modern Stymfalia. Anastasios Orlandos excavated parts of the site for the Archaeological Society of Athens between 1924 and 1930. Since 1982, excavations of the site on the north shore of Lake Stymphalia have been under way, directed by Hector Williams for the University of British Columbia. Archaeological surveys and excavations have revealed a town refounded in the 4th century BCE.The Bronze Age and early classical Stymphalus has not been precisely located. The later city was laid out on a grid plan, with six-meter (19 ft) wide roads running north-south every thirty metres (100 ft), which intersected major east-west avenues at intervals over a hundred metres (300 ft). Houses have also been identified, as have a theatre, a palaestra, a fountain house, several temples, and the sanctuary, where an inscription preserving the letters POLIAD... (\\"of Athena Polias\\") found by Orlandos in 1925, but now lost, seems to indicate Athena Polias as the divinity worshipped, though no further confirmation of this has been found. A graffito on a sherd from the site refers to the goddess of childbirth, Eilythyia. Large quantities of jewelry (mostly copper or bronze) suggest a sanctuary frequented by women; the partially preserved statue of a child supports the kourotrophic interpretation of the cult. In an annex to the temple, several dozen loom weights suggest the further presence of Athena in a weaving workshop. The sanctuary was destroyed, probably by the Romans in 146 BCE, but later seems to have been at least revisited to judge from early to mid-Roman pottery lamps from the area.

The book gives details of the purported Soviet autopsies of Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, their children, and General Hans Krebs. Each of these individuals are recorded as having been subjected to cyanide poisoning. Some of the theories the book presents concerning the death of Hitler have been discredited, including by the author. Content The book opens with a 66-page overview of the battle of Berlin and its aftermath by Bezymenski. Its appendix features a document of the discovery of the Goebbels family's corpses and 38 pages of autopsy reports. The Death of Adolf Hitler Bezymenski gives an account of the battle of Berlin, the subsequent investigation by SMERSH, supplemented by later statements of pertinent Nazi officers. According to SMERSH commander Ivan Klimenko, Soviet Private Ivan Churakov discovered legs sticking out of the ground in a crater outside the Chancellery. Two corpses were exhumed, but Klimenko had them reburied, believing that another body might be Hitler's. On the morning of 5 May, the other corpse was debunked as being Hitler's and Klimenko had the other two bodies reexhumed. On 13 May, SMERSH produced a report of the initial disposal of the corpses based on the testimony of an SS guard. A report on the purported forensic examination of Hitler's body states that the \\"remains of a male corpse disfigured by fire were delivered in a wooden box ... On the body was found a piece of yellow jersey ... charred around the edges, resembling a knitted undervest.\\" It notes that the corpse was \\"severely charred\\" and that \\"part of the cranium [was] missing.\\" The height of the body was judged to be about . Both the left foot and testicle were missing. Hitler's dental remains consisted of nine upper teeth with dental work connected by a gold bridge and part of a lower jawbone with 15 teeth (10 of them artificial); the latter was found loose in the oral cavity. The tip of the tongue was \\"firmly locked between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.\\" The alveolar processes of the mandible were broken with \\"ragged edges\\". Splinters of glass and a \\"thin- walled ampule\\" were found in the mouth (as from a cyanide capsule), which was ruled to be the cause of death. Bezymenski also gives an account of discrepancies of certain reports. For instance, after being published in Der Spiegel, Heinz Linge changed his account of Hitler's suicide gunshot from being to the left temple to being to the right—Bezymenski points out that the former is unlikely as Hitler was right-handed. Between 1950 and 1960, Otto Günsche changed his account of the position of Hitler and Braun's bodies from being on the couch to being in chairs. Soviet forensic expert Faust Shkaravsky concludes from the examination held on 8 May that \\"No matter what is asserted ... our Commission could not detect any traces of a gun shot ... Hitler poisoned himself.\\" Bezymenski posits that Hitler may have died by the combination of cyanide poisoning and a coup de grâce by citing the little black dog found nearby, which was killed in a similar fashion. Appendix The appendix includes the purported Soviet forensic reports on the bodies of Braun, the Goebbels family, General Krebs, Hitler's dog Blondi, and another small dog. Eva Braun The body presumed to be Braun's is noted as being \\"impossible to describe the features of\\", owing to its extensive charring. Almost the entire upper skull was missing. The occipital and temporal bones were fragmentary, as was the lower left of the face. Three molars and one detached root were found in the upper jaw, as well as a loose canine; the others were missing, as were the alveolar processes. Six of the lower jaw's left teeth were preserved, while those of the right side were missing. A gold bridge with two false molars was found, detached, under the tongue. The woman was judged to be no more than middle-aged due to her teeth being only slightly worn; her height was approximately . There was a splinter injury to the chest resulting in hemothorax, injuries to one lung and the pericardium—accompanied by six small metal fragments. Pieces of a glass ampule were found in the mouth cavity, and the smell of bitter almonds which accompanies death from cyanide poisoning was present; this was ruled to be the cause of death. Goebbels family The remains of Joseph and Magda Goebbels were discovered near the bunker door by Ivan Klimenko on 2 May 1945. The next day, Senior Lieutenant Ilyin found the bodies of the Goebbels children in one of the rooms of the bunker. The bodies were identified by Vizeadmiral Hans-Erich Voss, cook Wilhelm Lange, and garage mechanic Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Schneider, \\"all of whom knew [the Goebbels family] well.\\" Joseph Goebbels' body was \\"heavily scorched\\", but was identified by his size, estimated age, shortened right leg and related orthopedic appliance, as well as his head characteristics and dental remains, which included many fillings. His genitals were \\"greatly reduced in size, shrunken, dry.\\" Chemical testing revealed cyanide compounds in the internal organs and blood; cyanide poisoning was judged to be the cause of death. Voss identified two items found on Magda's corpse as having been in her possession: a cigarette case inscribed \\"Adolf Hitler—29.X.34\\", which she had used for the last three weeks of her life, and Hitler's Golden Party Badge, which the dictator had given her three days before his suicide. Additionally, a reddish-blond hairpiece was identified as matching the color of one Magda wore. Her dental remains were found loose on the corpse along with splinters from a thin-walled ampule; the cause of death was ruled to be cyanide poisoning. General Krebs General Krebs is erroneously listed in the autopsy report as \\"Major General Krips\\". Cyanide compounds were detected in the internal organs and the smell of bitter almonds was recorded, leading the commission to conclude that Krebs' death was \\"obviously caused by poisoning with cyanide compounds.\\" Three light head wounds are presumed to have been obtained from his death fall onto a protruding object. Dogs A large German Shepherd matching Hitler's dog Blondi's description appears to have died from cyanide poisoning. A small black bitch, about 60 centimetres (2 ft) long and 28 centimetres (1 ft) tall, was poisoned by cyanide before being shot in the head. Photographs The 16 pages of photographs include those of Ivan Klimenko, head of autopsy commission Faust Shkaravsky, the locations of Hitler's burning and burying site outside the Führerbunkers emergency exit, SMERSH agents exhuming Hitler and Braun's remains, a diagram of where the corpses of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels were burned, Hitler and Braun's corpses in boxes, Hitler's dental remains and a sketch drawn by Hitler's dentist's assistant Käthe Heusermann on 11 May 1945 to identify them, Braun's dental bridge, the first and last page of Hitler's autopsy report, the Soviet autopsy commission with both Kreb's and Joseph Goebbels' corpses, the bodies of the Goebbels family, the bodies of Krebs and the Goebbels children at Plötzensee Prison, and Blondi's corpse. History and criticism On why the autopsy reports were not released earlier, Bezymenski says: > Not because of doubts as to the credibility of the experts. ... Those who > were involved in the investigation remember that other considerations played > a far larger role. First, it was resolved not to publish the results of the > forensic-medical report but to \\"hold it in reserve\\" in case someone might > try to slip into the role of 'the Führer saved by a miracle'. Secondly, it > was resolved to continue the investigations in order to exclude any > possibility of error or deliberate deception. The Soviet forensic examination of Hitler's corpse was used by forensic odontologists Reidar F. Sognnaes and Ferdinand Strøm to reconfirm Hitler's dental remains at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1972; this was originally done by Käthe Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann in 1945. In 1995, Western historians Ada Petrova and Peter Watson wrote that they considered Bezymenski's account at odds with British MI6 intelligence officer Hugh Trevor-Roper's report, published as The Last Days of Hitler (1947). However, Petrova and Watson used Bezymenski's book as a source for theirs. They also cited Hitler's autopsy report to refute Hugh Thomas's theory that Hitler's remains were not his own, saying the entire jawbone structure would have had to have been found loose on the body while clamping down on the tongue, which \\"would presumably be a very difficult arrangement to fake.\\" Also in 1995, Bezymenski admitted that his work included \\"deliberate lies\\". In their addendum to The Hitler Book, Henrik Eberle and Matthias Uhl say that Bezymenski's work advocates theories promulgated by the Soviet Union that Hitler died by poisoning or a coup de grâce.

Background   Ohlone history  The Ohlone people have lived in what is now the Bay Area since 4000 BCE.Stanger, Frank M., ed. 1968. La Peninsula Vol. XIV No. 4, March 1968. The arrival of Spanish soldiers and missionaries in the 18th century disrupted and undermined the Ohlone people's way of life, and their population (along with that of other indigenous groups in California) was reduced to a fraction of its former size. When California was incorporated into the United States, the Ohlone (as well as most other indigenous groups) were denied land and legal recognition by the United States.  Modern activism  Beginning in the 1970s, Ohlone people have engaged in efforts to reclaim their land, and to revitalize their languages and cultures. In the 1990s, Corrina Gould (a Chochenyo and Karkin Ohlone leader) and Johnella LaRose (of Shoshone–Bannock and Carrizo heritage) co-founded Indian People Organizing for Change.  History  In 2011 Indigenous People Organizing for Change led the occupation of a construction site for a waterfront property called Glen Cove Park, which was being built on the site of an ancient Ohlone village, gathering place, and burial ground, known as Sogorea Te in the Karkin language. While the occupation was successful and development was halted, the land was not turned over to the Ohlone people, as they are denied recognition as a Native American tribe by the federal government of the United States. Instead, the land was transferred to the nearest federally recognized tribe, the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, which lacked any connection to the location or to the occupation, and consequently gave significant concessions to the land developers. To prevent a similar situation from occurring again, the Sogorea Te Land Trust was founded in 2012 by Gould and LaRose as a way to collectively own and buy back the traditional lands of the Karkin and Chochenyo people. The first plot of land for the Land Trust was donated by Planting Justice, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving food security, and is located near 105th Avenue in Oakland. A second piece of land, consisting of a small garden, was secured in 2018 on 30th and Linden in West Oakland.  Purpose  The vision for the land trust is for it to be a patchwork of small plots of land across the East Bay, the traditional territory of the Chochenyo and Karkin divisions of the Ohlone people, that would be available for communal use, beginning with land that is either owned by the city, neglected, abandoned, or under a lien. The organization is also in the process of building a ceremonial space at its 105th Avenue location. Long term goals for the project include a burial ground for the bones of Ohlone ancestors, medicine plant gardens, and educational and cultural centers for native languages and cultures. The organization also hopes to create an opportunity for all people to develop more active relationships with the land and as a community.  Shuumi Land Tax  In order to financially support their goals, the Sogorea Te Land Trust has begun a project that it calls the Shuumi Land Tax (shuumi means \\"gift\\" in Ohlone languages), which asks non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on. The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or Internal Revenue Service, but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions donations) as it asserts indigenous sovereignty. The suggested tax amount is calculated based on the would-be taxpayer's usage of the land: renters are asked to pay a small percentage of their rent, homeowners are expected to pay based on the number of rooms (for an estimated total between $65 and $500). Those who use the land for commercial purposes are expected to make a contribution based on the size and scale of their business.  In media  The founding of the Sogorea Te Land Trust is the subject of the film Beyond Recognition, produced in 2014 by Underexposed Films.

After immigrating to the United States, Ziffer received an engineering degree from Vanderbilt University, two master's degrees from the Graduate School of Theology of Oberlin College and a doctorate in theology from the University of Strasbourg in early Christian history, Biblical Hebrew and comparative religion. He is the author of many books including Confronting the Silence: A Holocaust Survivor’s Search for God and has spoken regularly throughout Western North Carolina regarding his experiences throughout the Holocaust.  Early life during the Holocaust  In 1942, as a young teenager, Ziffer was seized from his home and taken to a Jewish Ghetto in what is now the Czech Republic. Soon after arriving in the Jewish Ghetto, Walter found unexpected happiness. Walter fell in love with a blonde girl named Lydia, and spent nearly all of his free time with her. After a few weeks of being together, Lydia told Walter that her and her family would attempt to flee the Ghetto and seek asylum in the Soviet Union. Before she left, she gave him a golden pendant from her necklace and engraved in the pendant were the words, I love you. Days after Lydia's escape, members of the Jewish community went to Walters dad and informed him that Lydia and her parents had been killed. Soon separated from his family, Ziffer was sent to seven Nazi slave labor Concentration camps throughout the war. At the age of 18, he was finally liberated by Soviet troops and eventually was able to reunite with his parents and some of his siblings, who had been held in separate camps and also survived until their liberation. He returned home and apprenticed as a mechanic, then, years later moved to the U.S. with only 5 dollars to his name, he later worked for General Motors as an engineer. Walter in his book, Confronting the Silence: A Holocaust Survivor's Search for God, Walter tells many stories about his time in the seven internment camps. He speaks on one specific occasion while in a camp called Brande located in Silesia, Poland. During his time in this camp, he was a part of a slave labor camp he was favored by an inmate commander, Pompeii. This commander provided him with extra bread that had been stolen from other inmates. He was forced to do things like clean up dead bodies within the wash barracks. While he worked in these factories, Walter even gained some of his engineering skills while being enslaved in these factories.  Later in life after the Holocaust  In Dr. Ziffer's later years, his work mostly revolved around his teachings and lecturing at various higher education institutions and writings regarding Christianity's views towards Judaism, and guest lecturing about his experiences in the Holocaust. He published The Birth of Christianity from the Matrix of Judaism: From Jewish Sect to World Religion in 2006 and The Teaching of Disdain: An Examination of Christology and New Testament Attitudes Toward Jews in 2017 regarding these historical points of intersection between Christianity and Judaism which caused negativity and hatred. In his personal memoirs of Confronting the Silence: A Holocaust Survivor’s Search for God, he expands upon his conviction that he does not believe in God or a higher power saved him from death during the Holocaust, but rather that it was pure luck that he survived the seven concentration camps to which he was sent. He once said during an interview, “I cannot subscribe to their view of attributing my survival to God’s protection. I do not and wish not to see me singled out in some way by God from the rest of world Jew[s], of whom one-third perished by Hitler and his henchmen during the Holocaust. How could God make me survive while one and a half million innocent children went to their death without God intervening on their behalf?\\"  Speeches regarding the Holocaust by Ziffer  * http://www.krusch.com/bethisrael/    Links to Ziffer's writings  https://www.amazon.com/Walter-Ziffer/e/B001KC46K2  References  Category:1927 births Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Czech Jews Category:German Jews Category:People from Český Těšín Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:Vanderbilt University alumni Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to the United States Category:Living people ","title":"Walter Ziffer"},{"id":"58923520","text":"Ismaël Aaneba (born 29 May 1999) is a French professional footballer who plays as a rightback for the club Strasbourg.

At , it is Amtrak's longest route, and second-longest overall after the Texas Eagle's triweekly continuation from San Antonio to Los Angeles, with travel time between the termini taking approximately 51 hours. Amtrak claims the route as one of its most scenic, with views of the upper Colorado River valley in the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada. The modern train is the second iteration of a train named California Zephyr; the original train was privately operated and ran on a different route through Nevada and California. During fiscal year 2019, the California Zephyr carried 410,844 passengers, a decrease of 1.8% over FY2018.https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FY19-Year-End- Ridership.pdf The train had a total revenue of $51,950,998 in FY2016, an increase of 6.5% over FY2015. History Previous service The California Zephyr in 1970 Prior to the 1971 creation of Amtrak, three competing trains ran between Chicago and the East Bay, with bus connections to San Francisco: *The California Zephyr was operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;), Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;), and Western Pacific Railroad (WP) between Chicago and Oakland along what is today called the Central Corridor and Feather River Route via Omaha, Denver, Salt Lake City and Oroville. Amid much fanfare and publicity, the California Zephyr was inaugurated on March 20, 1949. It was discontinued in March 1970 – the only of the three trains not still operating when Amtrak took over service. *The City of San Francisco was operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) between Chicago and Oakland on the Overland Route via Omaha, Cheyenne, Ogden and Reno. *The San Francisco Chief was operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF;) via the more southerly Southern Transcon between Chicago and Richmond via Kansas City, Amarillo, and Bakersfield. Railpax (renamed Amtrak in late April 1971) originally intended to revive the California Zephyr as part its original route network, using the Burlington Northern (ex-CB&Q;) east of Denver, the DRG&W; between Denver and Ogden, Utah, and the WP west of Ogden. The California Zephyr route served more populated areas than the Overland Route (including Denver and Salt Lake City), ran through rural communities that lacked good highway access, and could attract passengers to its scenic routes. However, the WP had shed the last of its money-losing passenger service with the end of the California Zephyr, and it was not eligible to participate in Amtrak's formation. On April 12, 1971, the WP refused to cooperate with Railpax, and the SP route between Ogden and Oakland was chosen instead. On April 26, the D&RGW; elected not to join Amtrak; the contract specified that Amtrak could later increase service, and the railroad feared that would crowd its single- track mainline that competed with the UP's double-track route. The D&RGW; chose to operate the Denver–Ogden Rio Grande Zephyr, and Amtrak scrambled to piece together a Denver–Cheyenne–Ogden routing on the UP. Amtrak era An EMD FP7 and two EMD SDP40Fs pull the eastbound San Francisco Zephyr through the Yuba Gap in 1975. Between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1972, passengers traveling between Chicago and Oakland would have to travel on two different trains: the Denver Zephyr, which operated daily between Chicago and Denver, and the City of San Francisco, which operated three times a week, between Denver and the San Francisco Bay Area. Eventually, however, after several false starts, Amtrak consolidated the two trains into one, dubbed the San Francisco Zephyr, homage to both the California Zephyr and the San Francisco Chief, between Chicago and Oakland. The Rio Grande continued to operate the Rio Grande Zephyr between Denver and Ogden. In 1983, the D&RGW; elected to join Amtrak, citing increasing losses in passenger operations. Amtrak re-routed the San Francisco Zephyr over the D&RGW;'s Moffat Subdivision between Denver and Salt Lake City, its original preference from 1971. The change was scheduled for April 25, but a mudslide at Thistle, Utah, closed the line and delayed the change until July 16. With the change of route, Amtrak renamed the train as the California Zephyr. The modern California Zephyr uses mostly the same route as the original east of Winnemucca, Nevada. The train uses the route of the former City of San Francisco, along the Overland Route (First Transcontinental Railroad), between Elko, Nevada, and Sacramento. Across central Nevada, the two rail lines have been combined to use directional running. As such, the exact spot the train switches lines depends on the direction of travel. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, the California Zephyr operated in tandem with the Seattle-bound Pioneer and Los Angeles-bound Desert Wind. Since 1980, the PIoneer and Desert Wind had exchanged through coaches with the San Francisco Zephyr at Ogden. The exchange point was moved to Salt Lake City when the latter train became the California Zephyr. This created a massive train of 16 Superliner cars running from Chicago to Utah, easily the longest train Amtrak had operated outside of the Auto Train. Amtrak required at least four EMD F40PH locomotives to pull this behemoth over the steep grades of the Moffat subdivision. To ease the load, Amtrak began splitting the Pioneer from the Zephyr and Desert Wind at Denver in 1991, while the Desert Wind continued splitting from the Zephyr at Salt Lake City. The Pioneer and Desert Wind were both discontinued in 1997. The western terminus of the train was cut back to Emeryville station when Oakland Central station was closed on August 5, 1994. The California Zephyr was re-extended to Oakland with the opening of the Jack London Square station on May 12, 1995. However, this required a complicated reverse move along street running tracks to reach the wye at West Oakland. The train was cut back again to Emeryville on October 26, 1997. Service between Reno and Denver was suspended for about a month in April 2020, as part of a round of service reduction in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Frequency was reduced to tri-weekly in October 2020. Route description Amtrak California Zephyr The west-bound train is Amtrak number 5 (eastbound, it is number 6). Upon leaving Chicago Union Station, the train travels along the Metra BNSF Railway Line, with an intermediate stop in Naperville, Illinois. After passing through Aurora, Illinois, the train passes through the Illinois prairies, using the Burlington Rail Bridge to cross the Mississippi River in Burlington, Iowa. After running through southern Iowa, the Zephyr reaches the Missouri River between Council Bluffs and Omaha. From Omaha, the train travels through southern Nebraska and northeastern Colorado, before making a morning arrival in Denver. At Denver, the Zephyr switches over from BNSF to Union Pacific tracks. Westbound, the train is routed over the Central Corridor for the trip through the Tunnel District. The line crosses the Continental Divide via the 6.2 mile-long Moffat Tunnel under James Peak. Leaving the Moffat Tunnel, the tracks then follow the Colorado River from Winter Park Resort to Ruby Canyon, west of Grand Junction, which is also where the train enters Utah. In Utah, the train follows the southern rim of the Book Cliffs to their end near Helper. The Zephyr crosses the Wasatch Mountains, cresting at Soldier Summit before descending into the Wasatch Front to arrive at Salt Lake City. The westbound California Zephyr at Colfax From Salt Lake City to Emeryville, the Zephyr route loosely follows Interstate 80, traveling along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake and across the Bonneville Salt Flats towards Nevada. After crossing into Nevada at Wendover, Utah/West Wendover, Nevada, the route passes the Toano Range, via Silver Zone Pass, across the Goshute Valley, tunnels under the Pequop Mountains and then skirts the northern edge of the Ruby Mountains. The line first reaches the Humboldt River near Wells, which it loosely follows until the river's end in the Humboldt Sink near Lovelock. Here, the tracks cross the center of the Forty Mile Desert; on the other side of this desert valley is the Truckee River, which provides the line's path to Reno and up the Sierra Nevada in California. In California, the tracks round Donner Lake, crest the Sierra Nevada at Donner Pass, and descend a high ridge between the American and Yuba Rivers, through Emigrant Gap. The line empties out into the California Central Valley, and then runs along the San Pablo Bay, with stops in Sacramento and Davis. It crosses the Benicia Bridge and has stops in Martinez and Richmond. The trip ends in Emeryville, a suburb of Oakland. From Emeryville the free Emery Go Round shuttle connects passengers to the BART train or a Thruway Motorcoach provides connecting service to San Francisco's Embarcadero.

He was accused of murdering Apronia \\"for reasons not ascertained,\\" by throwing her out of a window in that year. Silvanus' response was to say that he had been asleep and was unaware of the circumstances leading to her death, saying that she had perhaps committed suicide. The murder was investigated by the Emperor Tiberius who, having investigated the couple's bedroom, discovered proof of a scuffle, and therefore referred the case to the Senate for trial. However, Silvanus' grandmother, Urgulania sent Silvanus a dagger, encouraging him to commit suicide, which he duly did.

Coat of arms of the Gouhier de Petiteville family A member of a very old Norman family, which had eleven branches, Charencey divided his life between politics and scholarship.

He was the founder of the Philological Society and the society of Saint-Jérôme, which published grammars, catechisms, and dictionaries for missionaries. In 1888, he became president of the Société de Linguistique de Paris. His œuvre was considerable. He was most interested in American languages and the Basque language, for which he wrote a dictionary, which was never printed. Despite some hesitation in his linguistic expertise, he sometimes had flashes of insight, as when he recognized a connection between Basque 'snake' and Estonian 'snake'.

Yates was an African American abolitionist, writer, and the President of the first Convention of Colored Men. He focused his writing in the form of articles and editorials in newspapers; along with responses about books and articles written on slavery or civil rights. In contrast to common perception, Yates is not the author of Rights of Colored Men to Suffrage, Citizenship and Trial by Jury (1838) which addressed several topics that included the disenfranchisement of African-Americans on the East Coast. The William Yates who produced the treatise was a white abolitionist with no known ties to William H. Yates. p. 9.  Early life and career  William H. Yates was born into slavery in Virginia to a free black man and an enslaved Native American woman, which gave the slave owner a claim on Yates. Yates was able to later purchase his freedom, after which point he moved to Washington D.C., where he worked as a Porter in the Supreme Court. In this role he was able to make a living and earn a legal education along with having practical application in a time period of slavery and turmoil. During his time in Washington D.C., Yates also kept a hackney stable and is thought to have helped fugitive slaves along the Underground Railroad. He then had to flee to New York due to accusations of aiding fugitives, but after his business failed, decided to move his family to San Francisco.  Civil Right activism  In San Francisco, Yates worked as a columnist to The Elevator and a contributor for The Pacific Appeal. As a contributor for The Pacific Appeal he critiqued William Wells Brown's The Black Man, particularly against Brown's assertion that Black Californians were not invested enough into the cause of African Americans and did not patronize black newspapers. Brown responded to the critique, spurring a debate that lasted over several issues of The Pacific Appeal. Yates was viewed as a prominent elder in the African American community with intimate knowledge of how Congress worked, which prompted his appointment as the President of the Convention for the first Convention of Colored Men, held in San Francisco in 1855. In the Congressional proceedings he stated that: \\"I desire that members not enter into lengthy... discussions upon every question regarding which there may be a difference of opinion, but confine themselves strictly to the legitimate business of the meeting, so that the convention maybe enabled to close its proceedings today, and do so in a manner as to reflect credit upon ourselves and the cause we advocate.\\" In 1862, he was able to finally see success when the State of California repealed the laws preventing black men from having legal, judicial, and economic rights. William Yates died around September 18, 1868. He was approximately 51–55 years old upon his death.

She is the CEO and co-founder of the legal artificial intelligence company Botler AI. In December 2019, Dutt was named as the only Canadian in the Forbes' 30 Under 30 2020 Law and Policy List.https://www.forbes.com/pictures/5ddd7cb0ea103f0006537307/ritika- dutt-28/#67b9595548fb  Early life and education  Dutt was born in India, spent her childhood in Hong Kong and her teenage years in Singapore. In 2009, she moved to Montréal, Canada to attend McGill University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science in 2013.  Early career  After graduating from McGill, Dutt headed the marketing department of a Y Combinator startup. She then took over the internal operations of Notman House, Montreal's Google for Entrepreneurs tech hub, where she fostered the local startup community by supporting and promoting innovative ventures and initiatives. Using her background in economics and innovation, Dutt then co- founded Botler AI in 2017 to enhance accessibility to the legal system, through artificial intelligence.  Experience with workplace sexual harassment  Prior to co-founding Botler, Dutt found herself faced with a stalker during a terrifying, months-long ordeal. The man showed up at her workplace everyday, stalked her on social media to learn of her location, and even followed her to her home. Though fearful, Dutt found herself making excuses thinking \\"It’s all in my head\\" or \\"I don't know if something is really wrong or if I'm too sensitive\\". She didn’t know what her rights were, what she should do, or if the man’s actions were illegal. The experience left her feeling trapped and Dutt struggled to call it what it was: stalking, or criminal harassment in Canadian law. Months later, after the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and ensuing spread of the #MeToo movement, Dutt started researching the relevant legal codes and learned what had happened to her was a crime. She gained confidence from learning there was a legal basis to what she had felt and that she had been justified with her discomfort. Dutt realized that sexual harassment was a far bigger issue than imagined and found herself angered thinking “How many people think they can do this and get away with it?\\".  Botler AI  In December 2017, motivated to take action by her personal experiences, Dutt led Botler AI to launch a free tool to help survivors of sexual harassment determine whether their rights had been violated. The tool was aimed as an impartial resource to empower the average person through information and education, without fear of judgment. Dutt's premise was that, unlike humans, a robot has no prejudice of race, gender, sexual orientation or socio-economic background, would never ask “What were you wearing?” or “How many drinks did you have?”, and therefore provided an emotion- and judgement-free neutral tool to complainants. The Artificial Intelligence system, which also used deep learning, was trained using over 300,000 court documents from Canada and the United States. Natural language processing was used to determine whether an incident described by the user could be classified as sexual harassment. The user was provided with a summary of the relevant legal codes, based on their jurisdiction, and a detailed report of the incident which could be handed over to the relevant authorities, from HR to the police, if desired. The goal was not to let the user know whether they could win a case in court, but rather to empower them with confidence grounded in legal doctrine. Dutt stressed, “Once people have the information then it’s up to them what they want to do with it... maybe they feel comfortable to approach somebody like HR…or maybe it makes them feel better that it’s not just in my head, and I have the right to stand up to my abuser because I have rights in this situation.” Dutt also commented “This is just the first step” and revealed plans to expand Botler to connect users with resources appropriate with their situation, including legal representation.

Career  2018 In 2018, Perebinosova was named to Russia’s team for the European championships alongside Irina Alexeeva, Aliya Mustafina, Angelina Simakova, and Lilia Akhaimova. She was sent as a specialist, competing solely on the uneven bars. She qualified to the bars final in third after a successful qualification routine. In the team final, she posted a score of 14.033 on bars, which contributed to Russia winning the gold medal over France, who took the silver. Despite performing a clean exercise in the uneven bars final, she ended up finishing in fifth with a score of 14.166, a tenth down from her qualification performance. 2019 Perebinosova made her 2019 debut at the Universiade games in Italy, which she attended with Akhaimova and world champion Tatiana Nabieva. She replaced Polina Fedorova, who was initially slated to be on the team. She contributed scores on bars, beam, and floor to Russia’s silver medal performance in the team final. Perebinosova also qualified to the all-around final in third place, posting the same score as teammate Akhaimova (53.000) but ranking lower due to tie-breaking procedures. In the all-around final, Perebinosova incurred a five-tenth deduction on for putting her hands on the beam to steady herself. Once again, she and Akhaimova posted the same total score (52.700), but Perebinosova edged her teammate out for the silver medal, in part due to a high uneven bars score (14.375). Both Russians finished behind Japanese gymnast Hitomi Hatakeda. In event finals, despite qualifying in second, Perebinosova placed seventh on bars after struggling through her routine, scoring a low 12.750. However, she rallied to win the bronze medals on both beam and floor, posting scores of 12.800 and 12.700, respectively. The Russian squad of Perebinosova, Akhaimova, and Nabieva was the most decorated in women’s artistic gymnastics at the Universiade, bringing in one gold, three silver, and four bronze medals. Perebinosova was the most decorated of the Russians with two silvers and two bronzes. Perebinosova competed at the Russian Cup and was one of nine gymnasts in contention for the worlds team.

Career After a brief stint of practicing law, it was through her work as a Legal Specialist for the New Jersey State Agriculture and Development Committee that Ezeilo embarked upon a career as an environmentalist. Ezeilo further honed her skills as a Project Manager for the Trust for Public Land (TPL) in both its New Jersey and Georgia offices. In her position, Ezeilo acquired land for preservation and worked on the New York/New Jersey Highlands Program, Parks for People-Newark, the New York/New Jersey Harbor Program in New Jersey, the Atlanta Beltline and the 20 County Regional Greenspace Initiative in Georgia. While at TPL, Ezeilo realized the disconnect between the land that was being preserved and the education of people about that preservation—particularly as it related to our next generation. This was the impetus for the Greening Youth Foundation. Creating nonprofit Ezeilo love for the environment stretches far back to when she was a little girl who had the chance to escape the dense urban streets of Jersey City, New Jersey, to summer in upstate New York. Since launching in 2007, GYF has reached over 25,000 youth and young adults directly and indirectly through various environmental education, conservation and sustainability programs. Through strategic partnerships and growth, the organization now services the United States and West Africa. In 2015, GYF received the USDA Forest Service Award for Diversity and Inclusiveness. Greening Youth Foundation's vision is to create a new generation of environmental stewards and provide life changing opportunities in conservation and sustainability to under served, underrepresented and diverse youth across the globe. With a multi-million-dollar budget, the organization served nearly a thousand youth in the last fiscal year. Ezeilo is a member of the National Center for Civil and Human Right's Women in Solidarity Society and South Fork Conservancy boards; Advisory Board Member for the Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area, The Million Mile Greenway, Inc., Keeping It Wild, Inc., and Outdoor Afro; and board member for the Atlanta Audubon Society. Ezeilo has been recognized as one of the world's leading social entrepreneurs as an Ashoka Fellow in 2016. Ezeilo is on the Steering Committee for a new endeavor called the Children's Wellbeing Initiative—a network of 22 Change-Makers working together to promote children's wellbeing across the country. Ezeilo lives in Atlanta with her husband James, who assists her in running GYF. They have two children.

Made from the thermoplastic HDPE (high-density polyethylene), its high level of impermeability and strong molecular bond make it suitable for high pressure pipelines. HDPE pipe is used across the globe for applications such as water mains, gas mains, sewer mains, slurry transfer lines, rural irrigation, fire system supply lines, electrical and communications conduit, and stormwater and drainage pipes.  Benefits  The toughness and resistance to chemicals of polyethylene, as well as the corrosion resistance and low weight have contributed to its growing use in situations where cost-effective and durable fluid and gas piping systems are required. According to a press release from the Plastics Pipe Institute, \\"PE piping has been used for water and other fluids in Europe and America since the 1950s due to its durability, leak free joints, resistance to corrosion, and long-term cost-effectiveness.\\" HDPE pipe can be joined by butt welding, electrofusion welding, socket welding, or extrusion welding. These joints heat the pipe during the joining process, creating a completely homogenous joint so the weld becomes as strong, or stronger than the existing pipe on either side of the weld. There is no need to use rubber seals or jointing chemicals, as is used for joining PVC pipe, which cause environmental health issues and increase the chance of failure over time. PE is less likely to have problems with root intrusion, and provides integrity for the pipeline, even when installed in unstable soils. HDPE communications conduit pipe being installed by directional drilling in Perth, Western Australia Due to the fusion welded system, the need for anchors or thrust restraint blocks are eliminated, as the joints become fully end load resistant, reducing costs for material and installation time. This also allows for safer excavation close to the pipeline in future, which is particularly important for high pressure gas pipelines. Coils of PE Pipe make trench-less installation safer and less intrusive on the surrounding environment. HDPE Pipe Systems are available for many applications, providing for standard trenching of water mains, fire ring mains, sewer mains, and gas mains pipelines, as well as horizontal drilling for electrical and telecommunications conduits. According to a company that manufactures HDPE, HDPE systems are cost-effective to install and have long-term maintenance cost savings, and also allow for cheaper installation methods, such as HDD (horizontal directional drilling), sliplining, pipe bursting, floating and submerged pipe. HDPE pipe is very durable and flexible and can be bent on site to a radius twenty-five times the nominal pipe diameter - for SDR11 and SDR17 pipe, at or below 20°C ambient temperature. This provides major cost savings, when compared to different pipe systems, some of which require glued fittings, restraints or thrust blocks for even minor changes in direction. Because of the high impact resistance and flexibility of HDPE pipe, it is well suited to installation in dynamic soils including in earthquake-prone areas. HDPE pipe has very high flow capacity, because of its smooth bore and end-to-end jointing methods. HDPE pipe does not corrode in the environment, and will maintain its flow capabilities over time, unlike ferrous piping systems, which will rust and build up internal resistance to fluid flowing through it. Because food-grade polyethylene virgin material is used to fabricate HDPE pipes, they are safe for the transfer of potable water, provided that any initial debris has been flushed out. HDPE pipe is resistant to many chemicals, facilitating its use in process plants or around corrosive or acidic environments, without needing to use protective coatings or galvanising, as is required on steel pipes. As HDPE has a very low thermal conductivity, it can maintain more uniform temperatures compared to metal pipes, when carrying fluids, which will greatly reduce any need for insulation to control condensation around the pipeline.  Manufacture  To make pipe lengths, HDPE resin is heated and extruded through a die, which determines the diameter of the pipeline. The wall thickness of the pipe is determined by a combination of the size of the die, speed of the screw and the speed of the haul-off tractor. Polyethylene pipe is usually black in color due to the addition of 3-5% of carbon black being added to the clear polyethylene material. The addition of carbon black creates a product which is UV resistant. Other colours are available but are less common. Coloured or striped HDPE pipe is usually 90-95% black material, with just a coloured skin or stripe on the outside 5%. The following shows the process for HDPE Pipe Extrusion: Freshly Extruded HDPE Pipe Polyethylene raw material is pulled from a silo, into the hopper dryer, which removes any moisture from the pellets. Then it is pulled by a vacuum pump into the blender, where it is heated by a barrel heater. The PE material becomes molten at around , allowing it to be fed through a mould/die, which shapes the molten material into a circular shape. After coming through the die, the newly formed pipe quickly enters the cooling tanks, which submerge or spray water at the pipe exterior, each one reducing the temperature of the pipe by 10-20 degrees. Because polyethylene has a high specific heat capacity, the pipe must be cooled in stages, to avoid deforming the shape, and by the time it reaches the \\"haul-off tractor,\\" it is hard enough to be gently pulled by the 2-3 belts. A digital or powder printer, the size, type, date and manufacturers name is printed on the side of the pipe. It is then cut by a saw cutter, either into lengths of , or it is coiled to lengths on a coiler. HDPE Pipe with Blue stripes A different die is used for striped HDPE pipe, which has small channels that the coloured material runs through, just before it is pushed through the die. This means the stripes are formed as an integral part of the pipe and are not likely to separate from the main pipe body. Co- extruded, or co-ex HDPE pipe, has a second extrusion screw which adds an extra skin of colour around the black HDPE pipe, this allows the pipe to be coloured on the outside, for identification or thermal cooling requirements.  Uses  An example of the durability of HDPE pipe is the long HDPE boom used for the Ocean Cleanup project. The HDPE pipeline is being released into the ocean to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. HDPE pipe has been used in rural and mining environments in Australia for over 50 years, proving to be a very durable and effective means of fluid and gas transfer.  Life expectancy  HDPE yellow jacket gas pipe, white jacket communications conduit, and orange jacket electrical conduit Although HDPE pipe is often estimated to last 50 years, they are in fact more likely to have life expectancies of 100 years. PIPA (Plastics Industry Pipe Association) and the Plastic Pipe Institute (PPI) have written technical white papers on HDPE design life. The PIPA paper is called \\"Life Expectancy for Plastics Pipes\\" which mentions that because of the fifty-year stress regression data, people falsely assume that plastic pipe systems' life expectancy is only fifty years. In fact, these pipe systems can be reasonably expected to last up to or more than 100 years. In Australia, PE pipes and PE fittings were introduced during the mid-1900s, mainly for irrigation or water supply, but also for gas, fuel, and other industrial applications. The use of this 50-year time interval, leads to a misunderstanding that it represents a 50-year pipe life. For pipe systems that have been correctly manufactured and installed, the actual life cannot be predicted, but can be expected to be over 100 years until major rehabilitation is needed.

It was entirely written in Spanish by Cristina Maria Chiluiza and Inna, while Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan and David Ciente handled the production. A ballad, the song lyrically features a female empowerment message about leaving a toxic relationship and gaining confidence. Its sound differs significantly and acts as a departure from Inna's previous, club-oriented releases. \\"Ra\\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release, with a number of them pointing out its catchiness. For promotion, an accompanying, minimalistic music video was uploaded onto the singer's YouTube channel simultaneously with the digital release of the song. Filmed by Bogdan Păun, it portrays Inna and five other women posing together or individually in front of a planter wall. Inna further supported the song with live performances at the 2018 Telehit Awards and on television program Hoy in Mexico in November 2018. It peaked at number 71 on Romania's Airplay 100 ranking. Background and composition On 16 October 2018, Inna released a video on her YouTube channel in which she teased her upcoming sixth studio album Yo by briefly elaborating on its creation; in the description of the clip, Inna announced that the first single from the record would be released on 2 November 2018. She eventually confirmed the aforementioned during a social media post and revealed the single's name to be \\"Ra\\". Leaked beforehand, \\"Ra\\" was digitally made available on the announced date by Roc Nation internationally, with the title stylized in caps for the international release, but released on 27 September 2018 by Global Records in Romania. Two remixes were also released for purchase. Written entirely in Spanish by Cristina Maria Chiluiza and Inna, \\"Ra\\" lyrically features a female empowerment message about leaving a toxic relationship and gaining confidence. This is a topic that Inna rarely addressed in her previous work. The track's title alludes to the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun Ra, symbolizing \\"the light and the truth\\". The song was produced and engineered by Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan and David Ciente, while Max Kissaru mixed and mastered it. Musically, \\"Ra\\" is a ballad, and a departure from Inna's club sound, a \\"whole new era\\" according to Jonathan Currinn from website CelebMix. Mike Wass, writing for Idolator, noted that it \\"represents an important step in the 'Hot' hitmaker's journey from Hi-NRG club queen to a more mature, well-rounded artist\\". In the song's refrain, Inna repeats the phrase \\"Yo mejor me voy\\" (I better go). Reception Upon its release, \\"Ra\\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Currinn of CelebMix opined that it \\"feels more like an album track rather than an actual single\\", and suggested it to have been released as a promotional single from Yo. He further acknowledged that \\"Ra\\" is \\"a grower of a song and one that will get stuck in one's head, over time\\", and also praised the track's touching message, the songwriting and Inna's vocal delivery. Idolator's Wass noted the catchiness of \\"Ra\\", naming it an \\"anthem\\" and a \\"hypnotic bop\\". Billboard included \\"Ra\\" in their Best Music Picks Of the Week list for the week ending 4 November 2018. Commercially, the song peaked at number 71 on Romania's Airplay 100 for the week ending 2 December 2018. Promotion and other usage Inna teased the accompanying music video for \\"Ra\\" with two previews posted to her YouTube channel on 31 October and 1 November 2018, respectively. The visual was ultimately premiered simultaneously with the single's release on YouTube; Note: Open description for credits. it features Inna—wearing a black bra and top by Luisa Via Roma—and five fellow women—sporting orange bras—variating from posing together to individually posing in front of a planter wall. NGM Creative's Bogdan Păun directed the clip, while Alexandru Mureșan was hired as the director of photography and Loops Production as the producers. Andra Manea was credited as the make-up artist, Sorin Stratulat as the hair stylist, and RD Styling as the clothes procurers. A video showing the making of \\"Ra\\" was released online on 27 November 2018. Billboard noticed the connection between the song's lyrics and the video, as Inna \\"stands strong in the visual. It reaffirms the importance of having a voice, especially as a woman\\". Currinn of CelebMix likened the music video's message to that of Inna's track \\"No Help\\" (2018), while Idolator saw it as \\"striking\\" and \\"minimalist\\". For further promotion of \\"Ra\\", Inna delivered a live performance of the song at the 2018 Telehit Awards in Mexico City on 7 November, and performed it on Mexican television daily morning program Hoy on 8 November 2018, among other endeavours in Mexico.

The promotion initially announced on December 12, 2018 that the event had been \\"postponed\\" and would be rescheduled for a later date. However, the event was ultimately cancelled. Background Initially, the promotion was planning a UFC Flyweight Championship bout between 2008 Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling and current champion Henry Cejudo and two-time UFC Bantamweight Champion T.J. Dillashaw to headline this event. If successful, Dillashaw would have become the fourth fighter to be champion in two divisions simultaneously (after Conor McGregor at UFC 205, Daniel Cormier at UFC 226 and Amanda Nunes at UFC 232). According to sources, the promotion was expected to dissolve the flyweight division at some point within 2019. However, on December 5, the pairing was moved and took place a week earlier at UFC Fight Night 143, headlining the promotion's inaugural event on ESPN+. In turn, promotion officials tried to arrange a new pairing to anchor the event. However, the promotion announced plans in mid-December to postpone the event after they determined that they could not arrange a suitable headlining bout. All previously scheduled fights for this event are expected to remain intact and be rescheduled for other events, with the numbered events still maintaining their original titles. This was the fourth time, following UFC 151 in August 2012, UFC 176 in August 2014 and UFC Fight Night: Lamas vs. Penn in October 2016, that the promotion was forced to cancel an event because of a lack of a high profile fight to fill a main event spot. A lightweight bout between James Vick and Paul Felder was initially scheduled to take place in July 2018 at UFC Fight Night: dos Santos vs. Ivanov. However, Vick was pulled from that bout in late June to act as a replacement against former WSOF Lightweight Champion Justin Gaethje at UFC Fight Night: Gaethje vs. Vick and the bout was scrapped. The pairing was rescheduled for this event. Islam Makhachev was expected to face Francisco Trinaldo at the event. However, on November 11, 2018 it was reported that Makhachev pulled out from the fight for an undisclosed reason and he was replaced by Alexander Hernandez. In turn, Hernandez was pulled from that fight in favor of a bout with UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Donald Cerrone a week earlier at UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Dillashaw. A women's flyweight bout between KSW Women's Flyweight Champion and promotional newcomer Ariane Lipski and Joanne Calderwood was initially scheduled for the event. However, it was reported on December 2 that the bout had been rescheduled for the first event on ESPN+ instead. A bantamweight bout between former WEC and two-time UFC Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz and John Lineker was scheduled for the event. However, on December 11, it was announced that Cruz suffered from a shoulder injury and pulled from the event. As a result of the cancellation of UFC 233, Lineker was scheduled to face Cory Sandhagen at UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Dillashaw.

It is a rare eucrite that contains maskelynite (a glassy phase found in some meteorite impact craters) and is highly shocked. History Lithuanian press reported on 13 February 1929 that a meteorite fell somewhere near Biržai or Valkininkai. Professor of Vytautas Magnus University published a call to the public to provide information. He received about 100 written notes that helped to narrow down the area and determine the fall time at about 45 minutes past midnight on 9 February. ELTA published the narrowed down location on 2 April and the public started sending in various stranger looking stones, but the first piece of the meteorite was received only on 1 September. It was found near Padvarninkai and scientists investigated the area, but found no additional fragments. Locals collected 11 pieces with a total weight of that were donated to the university plus at least two other fragments that remained in private hands. The largest donated fragments weighted . The exact location of the finds is unknown but the strewn field was estimated at . In May 1969, another piece weighing was found about from Padvarninkai. Padvarninkai did not receive much scientific interest because the main fragments were held behind the Iron Curtain and were largely inaccessible to western scientists. New studies began to be published in early 1990s. Three full fragments, including the main mass, and two broken-off samples are kept at the Geology Museum of Vilnius University. The piece found in 1969 is held by the Institute of Geology and Geography in Vilnius. Other fragments are held: by the Russian Academy of Science, by the National Museum in Prague, by the Natural History Museum in London, by the Bartoschewitz Meteorite Lab in Gifhorn, by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, by the Geological Survey of Canada, and others. Analysis Upon initial observation, Padvarninkai was classified as a shergottite due to the presence of maskelynite (a glassy material found in some meteorite impact craters). At the time, the class had only two meteorites, the Shergotty meteorite and Padvarninkai. The classification was reassessed when the Zagami meteorite fell in 1962. Padvarninkai is now classified as a monomict eucrite (i.e. eucrite with breccia of a single rock type). Padvarninkai, as many other eucrites, is rich in both pyroxene (mostly orthopyroxene with exsolved augite) and plagioclase (mostly bytownite and anorthite) with small amounts of chromite, ilmenite, pigeonite, tridymite and troilite. While in this regard Padvarninkai is a typical eucrite, it is highly unusual due to its plentiful features that indicate extreme shocks, such as suevitic (melted) black veins and vitrified (glassy) sections. The melt veins were likely a result of temperatures reaching . Three primary lithologies were described in 1991: (1) fine and coarse grained of clasts of typical eucritic material, (2) a fine grained quenched texture that is a result of rapid cooling, and (3) a partially glassy matrix surrounding various clasts of pyroxene, feldspar and tridymite. Very small zircon grains, present in the first lithology, showed uranium concentration of 30–60 ppm but were fully depleted of europium. Small amounts of apatite and the zircon grains allowed dating Padvarninkai utilizing various radiometric dating methods. The lead–lead dating of the zircon grains yielded the age of Padvarninkai of 4.55 billion years. Other studies yielded similar results. Other methods were used to date other events between the initial formation 4.55 billion years ago to the collision with Earth in 1929. Using the argon–argon and rubidium–strontium dating, scientists have provisionally identified three impacts 4.1, 3.8, and 1.15 billion years ago.

He is best known for serving as mayor of Leposavić, a Serb community in the disputed territory of Kosovo, from 2009 to 2012. Mayor of Leposavić The government of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. This decision was not recognized by Serbia and was opposed by most Serbs in the territory, particularly in the four Serb northern communities (including Leposavić) that lie on the border with Central Serbia. The 2008 Kosovo local elections organized by the Kosovo government were largely boycotted by Serbs in these communities, whose de facto municipal representatives were elected in a separate process overseen by the Serbian government. On 9 July 2009, the Serbian government dissolved the existing municipal assembly of Leposavić and replaced it with a five-person provisional council with representation from different Serbian political parties. Ninić, a member of the Democratic Party (Demokratska stranka, DS) was appointed as mayor. This decision was met with some local opposition; a majority of members from the dissolved assembly held an unscheduled meeting to reject their dismissal as illegal.\\"Kosovo Serb town rejects town council dissolution by Serbian government,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 13 July 2009 (Source: Radio Belgrade in Serbian 1300 gmt 13 Jul 09). Nonetheless, Ninić was able to assume the mayoralty shortly thereafter. As mayor, Ninić took part in negotiations on the status of the Kosovo Serb community and its municipal government authorities in the border areas. In December 2009, he rejected a suggestion from the Kosovo government that pro-independence candidates elected in the 2008 elections organized by Priština (with negligible popular support, against the Serb boycott) be allowed to take power. He argued that both the Serb and Bosniak committees in Leposavić had clearly opted for Serbia in a recent repeat of parliamentary elections and noted that more than seventy per cent of the electorate in the Serb border communities generally had participated in recent elections organized by Belgrade.\\"Serbs in north Kosovo object to Pristina-controlled local governments,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 30 December 2009 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 28 Dec 09). North Kosovo Crisis In July 2011, Kosovo Police crossed into the Serb areas of North Kosovo in an attempt to gain control of the border crossings between Kosovo and Central Serbia, without consulting Serbia or the international forces of KFOR/EULEX. This action, ultimately unsuccessful, was met with strong opposition from the local Serb community, which established roadblocks in the area. These events became known as the North Kosovo crisis. Early in the crisis, a border checkpoint staffed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the Leposavić village of Jarinje was burned by protestors. Ninić expressed his disappointment in this action and said that Leposavić citizens had not been involved.\\"Paper flays Serbian officials for apologising to NATO-led force head over Kosovo,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 31 July 2011 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 29 Jul 11). Serb protestors established two new roadblocks in mid-September 2011, including one near the Jarinje crossing. Ninić defended this action, arguing that the Serbs had organized the blockade as a precaution and would not provoke any violence.\\"Kosovo Serbs block roads at Serb border flashpoints,\\" Agence France-Presse, 15 September 2011. When KFOR officials moved to dismantle the barricades later in the month, Ninić described their action as a provocation, taking place at a time when new international negotiations were set to begin.\\"Kosovo: NATO removes roadblocks, Serbs erect new ones as tensions rise,\\" AKI - Adnkronos International, 27 September 2011. On 30 September, he accused NATO forces of \\"blatantly violat[ing] the mandate approved by the United Nations\\" by undertaking a hostile action against the protestors, adding that he had told a KFOR commander not to use force against civilians.Branislav Krstic, \\"NATO troops raid Serb barricade in Kosovo's north,\\" Reuters News, 30 September 2011. The leadership of the Serb border communities was divided during the crisis. Some prominent figures, including Zubin Potok mayor Slaviša Ristić, accused the Belgrade government of betraying the interests of Kosovo Serbs and of colluding with the Kosovo government to integrate the Serb communities into the de facto independent territory. Ninić, who continued to support the administration in Belgrade, denied that this was the government's strategy.\\"Paper reports growing tensions among Kosovo Serbs,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 13 September 2011 (Source: Koha Ditore, Pristina, in Albanian 9 Sep 11 p 4).\\"Serbian paper says reports from Kosovo anticipate new violence,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 16 September 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 7 Sep 11). On 21 September 2011, the Serbian paper Danas reported that Ninić was the only mayor in the four border communities who was coordinating his actions with the Serbian government and the only one who had not called for the replacement of Borko Stefanović as Belgrade's chief negotiator with the Kosovo government.\\"Serbian government has no control over Serb barricades in north Kosovo - paper,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 23 September 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 21 Sep 11). In November 2011, Ninić said he believed that the status of the Serb communities in Kosovo would be solved in accordance with Serbia's laws and constitution. If this did not happen, he added, a unilateral declaration North Kosovo's independence would not be inconceivable.\\"Kosovo-Serben erwägen Unabhängigkeitserklärung,\\" RIA Novosti, 21 November 2011. An agreement for the re-opening of the roads was reached in early December 2011.\\"Serbs open Kosovo crossing to boost EU ambitions,\\" Reuters News, 7 December 2011. Later in the month, the mayors of the other three Serb border communities called for a referendum on whether to recognize the authority of the government in Priština. Ninić argued that there was no need for a referendum, as Serbia's constitution already defined Kosovo as a part of Serbia.Branislav Krstic, \\"Kosovo Serbs call referendum on recognising Pristina,\\" Reuters News, 29 December 2011. He was quoted as saying, \\"We will not make any unilateral moves without the state of Serbia. At a session of the Serbian Assembly's Kosovo Committee no one from the opposition parties publicly supported the referendum idea. If our country had said that we should accept the Kosovo institutions, then it would be logical to hold a referendum and say 'no.' This way it is totally unnecessary.\\"\\"Three municipalities in Kosovo's Serb enclave set referendum for 14, 15 February,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 1 January 2012 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 29 Dec 11). The North Kosovo crisis was ultimately ended by the 2013 Brussels Agreement, which normalized relations between Serbia and Kosovo without resolving the status of the latter. Departure as mayor and subsequent activities Ninić stood down as mayor of Leposavić in 2012 when the Serbian Progressive Party formed a new governing alliance in the municipal assembly. He continued to lead the DS in opposition.\\"SNS preuzeo vlast u Leposaviću\\", B92, 7 July 2012, accessed 30 October 2018.

It aims to establish a culture of reading among young Arabic speakers across the globe as well as to highlight the importance of knowledge in shaping their future as well as the future of their communities and countries. The challenge was introduced as a response to a study that stated that Arab children read only 6 minutes a year.  Launch  The Challenge was launched by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai, in 2015, with the aim of encouraging children in the Arab world to read 50 million books through a series of prizes and incentives for children, faculties and educational institutions. The prizes and grants offered totalled $3 million. It was intended to address falling levels of readership in the Arabic language, with media citing reports such as that of the Arab Thought Foundation Arab Report for Cultural Development, which asserts the average reading time for an Arab child is six minutes a year compared with 12,000 minutes in the West and a study conducted by the Supreme Council of Culture in Egypt which found the average reading rate of an Arab individual is a quarter of a page a year compared with 11 books in the US and seven books in the UK. The Challenge focuses on students from Years 1 to 12 from schools across the Arab world. The competition runs annually from September to March. In order to enter the challenge, children are encouraged to read books and summarise them in a series of five coloured 'passports', with their teachers checking the summaries. Each passport has ten pages, hence children read fifty books throughout the academic year. They then pass through a number of qualification stages at school, district, national and regional levels. The winning student was awarded a $100,000 bursary as well as a cash grant of $50,000 made to the student's family. The school with the best reading initiatives was awarded $1 million funding while $300,000 was offered to the faculty member with the greatest commitment to reading. The balance of the funds awarded by the challenge were granted to participating students and schools. The headquarters of the challenge is the Dubai-based School of Research Science, with its principal, Najla Al Shamsi as its secretary-general.  2016 Challenge  The 2016 Arab Reading Challenge ran from September 2015 until March 2016 and was won by a seven year-old Algerian student, Mohammad Farah, with the Talaih Al Amal high school in Palestine winning the $1 million funding award. In all, 3.59 million students from 30,000 schools in 21 countries participated, more than tripling the target of one million students. 18 qualifying finalists travelled to Dubai for the finals, with the top five taking part in the final ceremony.  2017 Challenge  The 2017 Challenge was won by Afaf Raed Sherif, a 17 year-old Palestinian student, selected from the five finalists by a jury and a popular vote among attendees at the finals ceremony. The jury members were Bilal Al Badoor, Badrya Al Bishr, and the winner of the ARC distinguished teacher award in 2016, Hanan Al Hroob. In all, over 7.4 million students from 41,000 schools in 25 countries around the world, supported by 76,500 faculty, participated in the 2016 Challenge, reading over 200 million books. Al Iman School – Girls sector, in Bahrain, won the best school award, and the $1 million prize. Houriya Al Thil from Morocco won the most distinguished supervisor award, along with a US$100,000 prize.  2018 Challenge  The youngest of the five finalists in the 2018 Arab Reading Challenge was the winner: 9 year-old Mariam Lehsen Amjoun from Morocco took home the Dhs 500,000 prize money. The Ekhlas School from Kuwait beat 52,000 participating schools to take the Dhs1 million prize for having the best reading initiatives in the region and Aisha Tuwergy from Saudi Arabia took home Dh300,000 for being the faculty member who had done most to encourage reading in her school. The Challenge was formally opened up to a wider international audience for the first time and a new award was introduced for a student from a non-Arab country, won by Tasneem Aidi from France. The entrants from non-Arab countries compete for an award of Dhs100,000 and are only required to summarise 25 books to enter. In all, students based in 44 countries took part in the 2018 Challenge, which saw a 25% increase in participation to a total of 10.5 million students and 87,000 faculty members.
