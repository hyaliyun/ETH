Oil on wood, 141 x 176.5 cm (including frame), 122 x 157 cm (excluding frame). alt=The Virgin Mary and the child Jesus seated on an elevated throne decorated with biblical figures. To the left is St. Donatian (standing). The panel's donor Joris van der Paele kneels in prayer as St. Donatian stands over him. The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele is a large oil-on-oak panel painting completed around 1434‚Äì1436 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It shows the painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at the centre of the semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George‚Äîthe donor's name saint‚Äîto her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial. The saints are identifiable from Latin inscriptions lining the borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature. The van der Paele panel is widely considered one of van Eyck's most fully realised and ambitious works, and has been described as a \\"masterpiece of masterpieces\\".Van Der Elst (1944), 65 Commission alt=Detail showing the aging and grizzled face of Canon van der Paele Joris van der Paele is identifiable both from his resemblance and by the paternal and maternal coat of arms at the corners of each frame.Brine (2015), 184 He was born in Bruges around 1370, and spent his early career as a papal scribe in Rome before returning to his native city in 1425 as a wealthy man.Borchert (2008), 56 He was appointed to a canonry of St. Donatian's collegiate church, a position which gave him income from the various parishes under his remit.Lane (1990), 1, 5 An illness around 1431Lane (1990), 1 left van der Paele unable to fulfil the functions of his office, and led him to reflect upon his position as canon and on his mortality. In response he endowed a chaplaincy to the church and commissioned this work from van Eyck. The artist was at the height of his fame and in high demand, and this, along with the large size of the panel, meant that the commission took a lot longer to complete than was initially envisioned; two completion dates can be found on the frame, implying that the earlier date was aspirational and missed.Brine (2015), 186 In return for the bequest, the church granted the canon a requiem mass, a daily mass and three votive masses a week, meant to intercede with the divine on his behalf. A second chaplaincy in 1443Rothstein (2005), 211 centred on prayers for his family, and guaranteed that after his death, the requiem mass would end with readings of the Miserere mei and De profundis.van Oosterwijk, Anne. \\"Madonna with Canon Joris Van der Paele\\". Vlaamse kunstcollectie. Retrieved 18 August 2012 Detail of Van der Paele's prayer book and spectacles Van der Paele may have kept the panel in his private chambers or as a church altar.Dhanens (1980), 212 He donated it to the church either in 1436 or on his death in 1443; it remained there until the church was demolished in 1779. Most likely the work was situated in the nave as an accompaniment to an altar for Saints Peter and Paul and used for memorial masses for van der Paele and his family. It was installed on the main altar after the Iconoclasm of 1566. An inscription on the lower imitation frame refers to der Paele's benefaction: \\"Joris van der Paele, canon of this church, had this work made by painter Jan van Eyck. And he founded two chaplaincies here in the choir of the Lord. 1434. He only completed it in 1436, however.\\"Borchert (2011), 146 Description Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, around 1435, Mus√©e du Louvre. Like van der Paele's panel, this work was created as an eventual memorial for the donor's burial church, in this case for Nicolas Rolin's family chapel in Notre Dame-du-Chastel in Autun.Smith (2004), 224|alt=The painting shows the Virgin Mary (on the right) crowned by a hovering Angel while she presents the Infant Jesus to the donor, Chancellor Rolin (to the left). It is set within a spacious Italian-style loggia with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river. The Virgin and Child is set in a rounded church with side ambulatories,Dhanens (1980), 215 with Mary occupying the area where the altarpiece would usually be positioned.Smith (2004), 225 The panel has an overall sculptural look; the throne, windows, arches and hanging canvases borrow from the conventions of Romanesque architecture. After the \\"Adoration of the Mystic Lamb\\" panel of the Ghent Altarpiece, it is van Eyck's second largest extant painting, and the only one in a horizontal framing. The Virgin and Child is characterised by its innovative use of illusionism and complex spatial composition. It is in its original oak frame,Verougstraete (2015), 412 which contains several Latin inscriptions, including van Eyck's signature, the date of completion, the donor's name, and texts related to St. George and St. Donatian.Verougstraete (2015), 101 The upper border contains phrases from the Book of Wisdom, comparing Mary to an \\"unspotted mirror\\". The figures, the minutely detailed clothes, and the architecture of the room and windows are depicted with a high degree of realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.Huerta (2003), 41 Figures As with van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, the panel creates an intimate setting between the donor and Virgin. This is emphasised by the donor's physical proximity to the Virgin which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, \\"mentally and pictorially [breaches] the barriers between heaven and earth\\" and implies the \\"patrons are visually immortalized as meriting the Virgin and Child's personal attention.\\"Smith (2004), 228 The intimacy is further enhanced by small details such as the overlap between the donor and Saint George, who casts a shadow on van der PaeleRothstein (2005), 53 and seems to have accidentally stepped on his surplice as he leans forward to introduce the canon to the Virgin. St. Donatian Detail of St. Donatian St. Donatian is positioned to the left of the Virgin, the more significant position in heraldic terms, and reflective of his status as dedicatee of the cathedral the painting was made for, and of the city of Bruges. He wears a cope and mitre, vestments found in contemporary inventories of the church. His blue and gold brocade cope is embroidered with images of St. Paul and St. Peter. The colouring of his vestments is very similar to those of the Archangel in van Eyck's Dresden Triptych of 1437.Friedl√§nder (1967), 62 Donatian stands in front of a set of windows that are just outside the pictorial space.Carter (1954), 61 He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand,Harbison (1997), 60 and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.Van Der Elst (1944), 66 Virgin and Child Detail of the Madonna and Child. Mary holds a flower between her fingers, while a parrot- like bird, perhaps a alt=The Madonna holds the Child in her right arm and a flower in her left. Her red gown is heavily folded, and she is surrounded by the oriental patterns of the overhanging tapestry. The panel is one of the earliest known northern European sacra conversazione (the Virgin and Child shown with a group of saints in a relatively informal grouping) paintings.P√§cht (1999), 82 The Virgin sits on an elevated throne, situated beneath a minutely detailed and extravagantly decorated brocade baldachin containing white rose patterns, symbolising her purity.Harbison (1997), 59 Given the church setting, Mary occupies the area where the altarpiece would usually be. The steps leading to the throne are covered with an oriental carpet. Her idealised facial type (and that of St. George) is very similar to the Virgin in van Eyck's Washington Annunciation.Friedl√§nder, 64 Although the Madonna's throne is in the mid-ground, her head is level with the standing figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach can be seen in the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.P√§cht (1999), 83 The Child has curly blond hair and sits on a white cloth, animated and upright, at the side of the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view.P√§cht (1999), 84 He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th- century restoration.Friedl√§nder (1967), 42 He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of Mass. St. George alt=Detail showing St. George in armour St. George stands in lavishly decorated armour, and appears relaxed and nonchalant, raising his helmet and left hand to introduce van der Paele.Borchert (2008), 58 The saint was the donor's name saint and St. Donatian's Cathedral was built () to house a relic of one of his arm bones.McDonald, (2002), 14 George's armour is similar to that of St. Michael in van Eyck's Dresden Triptych, while his steel shield resembles those in the Knights of Christ panel of the Ghent altarpiece. Art historian Max Jakob Friedl√§nder notes how St. George seems hesitant and unsure of himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedl√§nder \\"forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon\\". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and \\"this seems to embarrass him\\".Friedl√§nder (1967), 42-43 George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which he gestures to the Virgin gives the impression of a shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedl√§nder observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face \\"twisted into an empty smile\\".Friedl√§nder (1967), 43 The Virgin and Child can be seen in the reflection of George's helmet. Van Eyck alludes to his own artistry by including his self portrait as a reflection on the knight's shield. The artist depicts himself standing at his easel, in a manner that strongly resembles the self-portrait reflected in the mirror in his Arnolfini Portrait. In both that work and here, he shows himself wearing a red turban similar to that seen in the possible self-portrait Portrait of a Man, of 1433.Huerta (2003), 23Ridderbos et al. (2005), 68 Joris van der Paele The painting marks a departure from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space.Borcher (2008), 53 Van der Paele kneels to the right of the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, \\"disconnected from the perceptible world\\", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses.Rothstein (2005), 50 In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not look directly at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.Rothstein (2005), 51 Van Eyck does not shy from showing the physical effects of the canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.Watson; Hazleman (2012), 7Lane (1990), 3‚Äì4 Iconography alt=A man with a club beats to death another man, whom he holds by his hair alt=Samson holds open the jaws of a lion with his bare hands; right of Mary Imitation carving of alt=Representation of Eve shown on the arm of the throne Virgin and Child is rich with seamlessly woven iconography.Ward (1994), 9 Broadly, the elements on the left, including the imitation carvings, reference Christ's death, and those on the right his Resurrection.Borchert (2011), 59 The painting contains examples of van Eyck's habit of presenting the viewer with what art historian Craig Harbison describes as \\"a transfigured view of visible reality\\", via the placement of small, unobtrusive, details which \\"illustrated not earthly existence but what [van Eyck] considered supernatural truth. They would have been easy to discern for a medieval viewer\\".Harbison (1984), 589 The figures are in a church, surrounded by an arcade of semi-circular arches, which suggests it might be a choir.Borchert (2008), 57 The scene seems to be illuminated from invisible windows, with light spilling from the left foreground and the leaded windows behind the Virgin's throne.Dhanens (1980), 218 Mary's throne is placed where the altar would normally be positioned. The Child's white cloth is draped over Mary's red robe, which may represent veiled host during celebration of the Eucharist; a reference to Christ's death and resurrection. The churches in van Eyck's work are not based on historical buildings, but were amalgams of different buildings and fictitious spaces.Dhanens (1980), 222 The church might resemble St. Donatian's, which has since been demolished; it seems to share similarities with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, with elements of Romanesque architecture. Van Eyck's paintings are often spatially ambiguous; the more the viewer looks at them the more questions are raised. Reflecting a consensus among art historians, Ward interprets the contradictions as \\"either curiously incoherent or deliberately designed to enact a complex symbolic message.\\"Ward (1994), 24 Mary holds a stem that appears to grow from the parrot's feathers, culminating in a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers. A parrot was sometimes used as an emblem for the Virgin, but its juxtaposition with the plant is incongruous. The parrot and plant emphasise the floral background, symbolising the Garden of Eden, accented by the figures of Adam of Eve. The flowers' colours represent purity, love and humility; its petals are a symbol of the cross and Christ's sacrifice. The narrative of original sin, the expulsion and redemption is thus captured in a single realistic device.Ward (1994), 25 The carved representations of Adam and Eve appear on the uprights of the throne. The capitals on the arms of the throne show Cain beating Abel to death with a club to Mary's left, and Samson opening the lion's jaws to her left.Harbison (1997), 89 The carvings on the architectural capitals depict Old Testament scenes, including the meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek and the Sacrifice of Isaac. Frame and inscriptions Detail showing the lower right corner of the frame, with Jan's inscribed completion date of 1436, and the donor's crest of arms. A paint gap reveals plant fibres to the right of the join.Verougstraete (2015), 70 The panel is made from six horizontal boards linked by butt joins reinforced with a cylindrical rod, with the joins glued with plant fibres. The reverse is not painted, indicating it was intended to hang against a wall.Verougstraete (2015), 247 The frame comprises a main frame nailed and screwed at the side to two outer parts. The borders do not show signs of having hinges, indicating that the work was meant as a stand-alone panel, and not as part of a triptych.Nash (2008), 31 The corners are assembled with mortise and tenon. Each corner is reinforced by two pegs.Verougstraete (2015), 246 The boards were originally painted a uniform brown, and were degraded by gloss and overprint over the centuries. Following a series of restorations, mainly by Jef Van der Veken in 1933-34 and Edmond Florens in 1977, they are in good condition.Verougstraete (2015), 413 The inscriptions were placed on flat strips between the mouldings. The frame is richly inscribed, with van Eyck's signature, the coats of arms of both Van der Paele's paternal and maternal families, lettering identifying each of the two attendant saints, and a passage praising the Virgin. The inscriptions are painted in an illusionistic manner. Those on the lower border appear to be in raised cast brass lettering, those on the order borders appear to have been cut into the frame's timber.Nash (2008), 32 The inscription on the frame beside St. Donatian reads \\"SOLO P[AR]TV NON[VS] FR[ATRV]M. MERS[VS] REDIT[VR]. RENAT[VS] ARCH[IEPISC]O[PVS] PR[I]M[VS]. REMIS CONSTITVITVR. QVI NV[N]C DEO FRVITVR.\\" (He was the youngest of nine brothers; thrown into the water, he returned to life and became the first archbishop of Reims.

It was presumably one of the paintings in the church praised by Albrecht D√ºrer in his diary in 1521. In 1547 Mary of Hungary, Governess of the Spanish Netherlands, wanted to buy it for her collection, but the chapter politely refused, saying this would create \\"moans, protests, uproar and complaints\\" from the people. During a spate of Calvinist mob iconoclasm in 1578 it was moved to a private house for safety, and by 1600 it had been given a setting with side wings and now formed the main altarpiece, replacing a destroyed metalwork retable of the 14th century. But by perhaps 1628 it was in the sacristy and from 1643 above a new side altar.Brine (2015), 189 The painting was acquired, along with many other Netherlandish and Flemish works, by the Mus√©e du Louvre in 1794, during the plundering of the estates of aristocrats in the years of the French revolutionary army's occupation of the Southern Netherlands. Other works acquired in this way include the centre panels of van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, Hans Memling's Moreel Triptych and Gerard David's Judgement of Cambyses. Many, including the van der Paele panel, were returned to Bruges in 1816.Ridderbos et al. (2005), 177, 194 The return of the panel became entangled in a dispute over control and ownership between the French and Dutch-speaking officials of Bruges,Deam (1998), 1‚Äì33 but it was entrusted to the Flemish Academy of Bruges. In 1855 it became part of the municipal collections, at first at the Bogaerdeschool Museum, until it became part of the collection of the Groeningemuseum in 1930. The painting was widely influential in the 15th and 16th centuries. The set piece of Van Eyck's enthroned Virgin, with a distracted Child on her lap was both widely copied, and became a standard for the following 150 years. There are numerous surviving contemporary close and free copies, the most significant of which is the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp. Adriaen Isenbrandt included van der Paele's head in his Mass of St Gregory of 1550. Both panel and frame are in good condition. That the panel retains its original frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, apart from its aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.

Overview The Latimer Trust is an evangelical think-tank dedicated to providing biblical input and a considered response to significant issues within the Christian community and elsewhere, with a particular focus on the Church of England. The Trust is continuing and developing the work of Latimer House in Oxford during the 1960s. It produces books, studies, briefings and publications and supports research by grants and funding posts. The Latimer Collection is now housed within the library at Oak Hill Theological College in London. Trustees have included Donald Allister and Wallace Benn, and J. I. Packer is Hon. President. The director of research is Gerald L Bray. History Latimer House (the Oxford Evangelical Research Trust Limited) was set up under the initiative of J.I.Packer and John Stott as a centre for research. It was funded by donations, and published Studies, Briefings and Comments from 1978 onwards. The first Warden was Richard Coates (1960‚Äì61); he was followed by J.I.Packer (1962‚Äì69), John Wenham (1969-73), Roger Beckwith (1973‚Äì94) and Nigel Atkinson (1995‚Äì98). Towards the end of the 1990s the Trust struggled financially so the decision was made, with the permission of the Charities Commission, to wind it up and roll the proceeds of the sale of the house in Oxford into a new charity, The Latimer Trust, reg. charity no. 1084337. The books and journals have been rehoused in the library at Oak Hill Theological College, London N14 4PS, where the Latimer Trust office is now situated. Current activities Since 2001 the Trust has resumed its publishing activities, and maintains the interest in research by funding posts and offering small grants. The first Director of Research (2006- ) is Gerald Bray; Research Fellows have been Matthew Sleeman (2001-5), Andrew Atherstone (2005- ) and Kirsten Birkett (2013-).

(not available in wayback machine due to robots.txt) Biography Norman Adams began to draw and paint when he was still a child. He collected pictures from every type of magazine and book he could find and then found ways of improving them. He was especially captivated by the trompe l'oeil realism of artists like William Harnett, John F. Peto and John Haberle. He studied art at the Los Angeles Art Center School in the early 1950s. While he was in Los Angeles he spent months painting a portfolio in which he used his trompe l'oeil realism to convince the managers of the largest illustration agencies in NY that he could do what no other artist/illustrator could. The three largest agencies in NY wanted to hire him. He chose to work for the Charles E Cooper Studio. While Adams was working in NY he met his idol Robert Fawcett at a Society of Illustrators exhibition. Like most established Illustrators at the time Norman Adams considered Robert Fawcett to be: \\"The Illustrator's Illustrator.\\" When Norman Adams finally met Robert Fawcett, he, Fawcett, was so impressed with Adams' paintings that he considered Norman to be a Babe Ruth of Illustration, perhaps because Norman worked for the \\"New York Yankees\\" of Illustration at the time: the \\"preeminent\\" Charles E Cooper Studio. Another more obvious reason Fawcett might have referred to Adams as Cooper's Babe Ruth was his versatility. When Adams was working for Cooper only Don Crowley could paint realistically enough to be versatile. All of Cooper's other illustrators, like Murray Tinkelman, Coby Whitmore, and James Bama were too specialized to be versatile. Not only were they specialized but they were specialized for so long that they would not do jobs outside their ‚Äúspecialty.‚Äù What separated Adams's paintings from others was the ‚Äútrompe l'oeil‚Äù detail he routinely put into his paintings. It was this extra detail that made his paintings stand out, especially to professions like Cooper and Fawcett. Illustrators took for granted that it was a waste of time to put detail into their originals that would be lost in the published reproduction. Adams also knew this, but what he did not take for granted: although much of the ‚Äútrompe l'oeil‚Äù detail he put into his originals would be lost in reproduction, it was this detail that would get him new jobs that other illustrators would not get. It was all these additional jobs that made him Cooper's ‚ÄúBabe Ruth.‚Äù Adams' illustrations included works for Reader's Digest, Boys' Life, Harpers, National Geographic, TV Guide, Saturday Evening Post, True Magazine, Argosy, Sports Afield, Field and Stream, Business Week, Cabela's, Medical Economics, and other paperback covers. He also authored a textbook now in its 30th Edition, Drawing Animals. When the magazines started to fail the Charles E Cooper Studio had to downscale. This prompted Norman Adams to join an elite group of illustrators at Artists Associates. In 1980 Lenox hired him to do a very limited edition Lenox Collection of 12 unique plates that were released in 1982 called The American Wildlife Plates by Norman Adams. In the mid-1980s, Adams was given an opportunity to paint for the 1988 Minnesota Wildlife Art Show. His work was a life-sized Golden Eagle in a Grand Canyon setting. For years he sold his wildlife and animal paintings in galleries in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Ho is a cardiologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. Also known as Reggie Ho, he gained fame as the star kicker on the 1988 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Early life Ho grew up in Kaneohe on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. One of four children to Reginald and Sharilyn Ho, he attended St. Louis High School in Honolulu, where he played soccer and football. He was the Crusaders' placekicker. After high school, Ho enrolled in the University of Notre Dame and majored in pre-med. College career While at Notre Dame, Ho decided to try out for the football team as a walk-on player. He made the team in 1987 and appeared in one game, kicking one PAT against the U.S. Naval Academy. For the following season, head football coach Lou Holtz named Ho the team's starting placekicker. Standing 5'5\\" (1.65 m) and weighing 135 pounds (61 kg), Ho was by far the smallest member of the football team. However, in the first game of the season he endeared himself to Notre Dame fans by his performance against rival University of Michigan. Going into the game, the Fighting Irish were ranked #13 in the nation while the Wolverines were ranked #7. The game, played at Notre Dame Stadium, has since been known as the \\"Reggie Ho game.\\" In that game, Ho kicked four field goals as the Irish won 19-17. The win was the beginning of an undefeated season for Notre Dame as they won the 1988 National Championship. Ho would finish the 1988 season with 32/36 PAT and 9/12 field goals. Professional life After graduating from Notre Dame, Ho attended medical school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He received his medical degree in 1993 and also performed his internship there. Ho is now a cardiologist specializing in electrophysiology at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. He lives in Moorestown, NJ with his wife and two sons. On January 7, 2015, his story was a part of the ESPN series, 30 for 30: Shorts, as episode 29. The film was titled \\"Student/Athlete\\" and is the story of Ho's improbable journey to the Notre Dame football team, National Championship, and medical career.

It operated with a 10,000-watt transmitter output covering Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon.http://dzxq1350.weebly.com/profile.html History DZXQ is owned by Mabuhay Broadcasting System, Inc. (MBSI), a company founded by Quirino de Guzman Sr. and Arcardio Carandang in 1973. During the Martial Law era, DZXQ was a music station, competing with top-rater DWBL. Notable personalities include Divine Pascual & Bobby Ante. Since 1986, DZXQ was a fully maintained station filled with blocktimers. It is the first AM station to air Chinese programs between 9:00 pm to 12:00 am daily. It was the home of the Powerhouse Broadcasters such as Nar Pineda, Roger Arienda (who was once one of the anchors of DZMM), Rolly Canon, Narissa Gonzalez, Ducky Paredes, Jhino Parrucho, Ruben Ilagan, Popo Villanueva, Roland Lumagbas, Dr. Erick San Juan, Reggie Vizmanos and Roy Se√±eres. It was also the home of \\"An Affair with Baby Tsina\\", a lifestyle radio show. Back then, the station operated daily from 5 am to 12 midnight. In 1992, MBSI was granted a 25-year franchise to operate radio stations in the Luzon island. Based on recent SEC filing, MBSI is majority owned by the Ragasa Family, heirs of Quirino de Guzman Sr. with 64% share. On February 28, 2011, DZXQ went off the air, a few days after a group of investors acquired the station whose initial plans were only to close it down for six months. But fortunately, the plan was shelved.http://dzxq1350.weebly.com/ The affected broadcasters were informed that the station had been sold. Nar Pineda and the Powerhouse Broadcasters were forced to move to DWSS-AM, while some moved to DWBL. Acquisition by UNTV Later, it was found out that these new investors are related to UNTV. A 25% stake in MBSI was consummated by various companies related to the Henares family. UNTV is the flagship TV station of the Progressive Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) owned by businessman Alfredo \\"Atom\\" L. Henares. PBC's Chief Operating Officer (COO) Manuelito \\"Manny\\" F. Luzon became the President of MBSI. In November 2011, UNTV started its test broadcast on DZXQ's 1350 kHz frequency with a simulcast broadcast of UNTV's feed. Since then, AM radio operations was transferred to Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International (BMPI) headed by its Chairman and CEO, broadcaster and TV host Daniel S. Razon; as MBSI retains legal ownership of the frequency. BMPI is PBC's exclusive blocktimer and content provider in UNTV. The station's studio was transferred to UNTV Building, 907 EDSA, Philam Homes, Quezon City; followed by changing its callsign to DWUN; and it went into a 24-hour broadcasting service.

In 1967, the band placed second in a battle of the bands contest in Wausau, Wisconsin. They were contacted by a manager in Milwaukee, but got lost on their way to see him. They ended up at Kennedy Studios in Milwaukee and were introduced to Lenny LaCour by the studio's owner, Dave Kennedy. LaCour, who had relocated to Milwaukee from Chicago, was producing and managing local artists, such as Harvey Scales, and liked what he heard from the band. LaCour interested Chess Records in financing the band's recordings. However, Chess refused to release the recordings, which LaCour then licensed and issued under his own record labels. LaCour also persuaded the band to rename themselves Filet of Soul. The first single, \\"Sweet Lovin\\", was blue-eyed soul, released in 1969 on LaCour's Dynamic Records, and was an immediate Wisconsin area hit. In terms of the band's soul music directions, Mike Peace commented as follows: :My band, Attila and the Huns, were so impressed with Harvey Scales' live performance that we decided right then and there that we would start doing more soul music. We eventually became so good at it that we ended up changing the band name to Filet of Soul. Many of the recordings we did managed to fool the black radio station execs into playing our music on solid black stations. This was Lenny's idea. He knew he could promote a white band through his predominately black channels and he knew that he could also get plays on white stations as well.

LaCour released a 1969 follow-up single by the band on LaCour's Magic Touch Records, which was then followed by an album release in 1970, Freedom, on LaCour's Chicago-based Moniquid Records. Most of the songs were written in one evening, and the entire album recorded in one twelve-hour session. LaCour contributed two songs to the album and co-wrote a third, with Mike Peace. The album is notable for its engineer, Dave Purple, previously a founding member of The Cryan' Shames and at the time working at Chess Records, following his military service.Uncredited, In Memory of Dave Purple 1945-2001; The Cryan' Shames.

The band's success was hampered by the fact that LaCour was unable to obtain a national distribution contract for his records. He expected that, if the song were popular locally, national distributors would come to him.

Gedi was murdered in 2007, though the precise circumstances of his death remains unclear. He was one of several prominent members of the station's leadership killed, including fellow acting media directors, Muktar Mohamed Hirabe and Hassan Osman Abdi. In 2007, he was the eighth journalist killed that year in Somalia. Career Bashir Gedi served as the acting director for Radio Shabelle, an independent Somalian radio station that reports news while routinely highlighting government and military corruption. During Gedi's tenure, the government shut down Radio Shabelle, HornAfrik and IQK Koranic, and intimidated the station with violence, shooting at the building and rounding up 18 employees for questioning. Death After one week of hiding inside the building of Radio Shabelle because of threats, Bashir Gedi ventured home on October 19, 2007. It was then that he was killed by a group of young gunmen, reported to be between the ages of 14 and 20, who were armed with pistols. Jafar Kukay, Radio Shabelle's successor to Gedi as acting director was quoted in Reuter's reports saying, \\"The acting chairman of Radio Shabelle, Bashir Nur Gedi, was shot dead by unknown men armed with pistols while sitting in front of his house\\". To date, his murder remains unsolved. Following his death, two more acting directors of Radio Shaballe, Muktar Mohamed Hirabe and Hassan \\"Fantastic\\" Osman Abdi, have been murdered in a very similar fashion. Context Journalists in Somalia, which has been in a state of anarchy since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991, routinely face violence, arbitrary imprisonment and harassment. The danger has intensified since the Somali government, with Ethiopian military help, expelled Islamist militants from Mogadishu in 2007. Journalists not only face attacks from the government but also the insurgent forces angry with the critical reporting by Somalia's media. According to statistics kept by the Committee to Protect Journalists, 40 journalists have been killed or murdered in Somalia since 1992 and it is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists. Impact Although Bashir Gedi knew he was under constant threat of being harmed or killed by those factions angry with his Radio Shabelle's reports, he continued to lead his station in their mission to disseminate news. His and his colleagues' subsequent murders have drawn worldwide attention to the problems faced by Somalian journalists. Reactions Human Rights Watch called the development of independent and critical radio networks like Shabelle one of the most positive developments since Somalia slipped into anarchy. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"Shabelle, considered one of the leading stations in Somalia, has been harassed, threatened, and attacked by both government security forces and insurgents because of its critical reporting of the ongoing violence in Mogadishu.\\" Reporters Without Borders said, \\"The security situation in Mogadishu seems to be completely out of control. Abandoned by the Somali authorities and their international partners, journalists have become key targets who are easily accessible. One after another, the country's leading media owners are being eliminated. By taking no action in this climate of total impunity, those who could be in a position to stop these murders will end up becoming accomplices.\\" It criticized the state of total impunity whereby no suspects are ever brought to trial or convicted. The Somali press freedom group, the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), has proclaimed the murder to be politically motivated. Omar Faruk Osman, who is the secretary-general NUSOJ, said, \\"It is totally intolerable and sends a clear message to each media person that his or her life is at risk because of his or her media activity. We have been appealing to political groups to end killing of media people, but no group listens.\\"  See also  Somali Civil War References Category:Year of birth missing Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Somalia Category:Journalists killed in Somalia Category:Journalists killed while covering military conflicts Category:Murdered Somalian journalists Category:Somalian victims of crime ","title":"Bashir Nur Gedi"},{"id":"34441106","text":"Zola Helen Ross (May 9, 1912 ‚Äì November 20, 1989) (n√©e Girdey) was a Pacific Northwest writer.

All conjecture aside, and even more unusual as compared to their average labelmates' guitar-first philosophy, Culprit songs like 'Steel to Blood,' 'Ambush,' and 'Same to You' boasted extremely memorable, singalong choruses to go with their disciplined instrumental foundations. As it stands, Guilty as Charged remains a lost gem of American metal from the 1980s, and well worth seeking out for fans of other bands from the period.\\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff was less enthusiastic and found the execution \\"too loose, raw and undisciplined to impress\\", conceding that the band \\"showed promise and caused a lot of hype never to be fulfilled\\".

She was one of four sister ships (the others being , Santa Lucia and ) ordered in 1930 from the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Kearny, NJ. Her regular route included inter-coastal service between the east coast and the west coast of the USA via the Caribbean and the Panama Canal. She was the second of ultimately three vessels to bear the name Santa Rosa for the Grace Line. (The first Santa Rosa was a 1917-built ship that was sold in 1925.) Design and construction Designed by Gibbs & Cox, Santa Rosa bore some resemblance to their later ships, the and such as the signature winged funnel. The public rooms were all on the promenade deck. The dining room was located on this deck between the two funnels and had an atrium stretching up two and a half decks. Unique for its day was a retractable roof which allowed the passenger to dine under the tropical sky. The Grace Line also employed female waitresses instead of male stewards. All first class cabins were outside twin beds and private baths. Santa Rosa was registered with official number 231932 and call letters WMDA at ,1933 registry gross tonnage differs from that given in Troopships of World War II which states gross tonnage at 9,135. That lesser gross tonnage more closely matches registry information for sister ship Santa Paula and could be a mistake or result of recalculation of GRT after troopship conversion. registered length with home port of San Francisco. Prewar Grace Line service The Santa Rosa sailed on her maiden voyage on 26 November 1932. Her East-West coast route of New York-Seattle was 20 days and included a one-day call in Los Angeles and two days in San Francisco. The ship's service speed of 20 knots and her superior accommodation made her very popular compared to that offered by Pacific Coast shipping. In 1936 however the intercoastal service ended and Santa Rosa and her sisters transferred to service to the Caribbean. World War II service Santa Rosa in wartime gray livery. Santa Rosa was requisitioned by the US War Shipping Administration on 3 January 1942 with Grace Line operating the ship as agents and allocated to Army for troop service. Even in wartime gray, the ship retained her elegant oceanliner lines: > ..Further down and across the dock, the Grace Line passenger ship SS Santa > Rosa, also lay waiting. She was painted wartime gray but she still flaunted > her nubile twin funnels, sweeping bow and long, beautiful lines; She exuded > an aura of speed, luxury, and moonlight tropical nights. The SS Santa Rosa > was sexier than Rita Hayworth in a travel poster... Santa Rosa made 21 voyages from the east coast of the US from 1942-1945: one to Europe, one to Australia, one to India, and three to Africa. Her wartime voyages included: * January 1942 - New York to Melbourne and Noum√©a via the Panama Canal * April 1942 - Suez, Massaua, Adan, Durban * November 1942 - to the Clyde * November 1942 - to Casablanca * January 1943 - to Casablanca * February 1943 - Bermuda and Casablanca * April 1943 - Casablanca, Gibraltar, the Clyde, Algiers, and Phillippeville * August 1943 - Oran in Algeria * October 1943 - Boston to Swansea, the Clyde, Palermo, Newport UK * December 1943 - via Boston to Bristol and Newport * February 1944 - Belfast * March 1944 - from Boston to Avonmouth and Cardiff * May 1944 - via Norfolk to Naples and Gibraltar * July 1944 - via Norfolk to Oran, Naples, and Cape Henry * October 1944 - Marseilles, Oran, and Gibraltar * December 1944 - from Boston to Swansea and return to Boston * January 1945 - Le Havre and Southampton * February 1945 - to La Harve and Plymouth * March 1945 - to The Solent, Le Havre, Southampton * June 1945 - Southampton * July 1945 - Le Havre and Cherbourg with return to Hampton Roads, to Plymouth and Le Havre * August 1945 - Le Havre and Cherbourg with return to Hampton Roads, to Plymouth and Le Havre * September 1945 - Marseilles * October 1945 - from New York via Port Said to Karachi * December 1945 - from New York via Port Said to Karachi with return to New York in January 1946 The vessel was returned to Grace Line on 3 February 1947. Postwar Grace Line service After her war service she underwent repair and refit at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company prior to redelivery to her owners. Santa Rosa returned to Grace Line and resumed the Caribbean service on 7 February 1947. In 1958, after 26 years of service, Santa Rosa was replaced by a larger liner of the same name. In June 1958 Santa Rosa was renamed Santa Paula. The older ship was laid up at Hoboken, NJ until 1961 when she was sold to Greek owners. Typaldos Lines service SS Athinai in the port of Piraeus in the 1963 film The Bullfighter Advances Santa Rosa was renamed Athinai and began a new career as a cruise ship for Typaldos Lines. A refit increased her accommodation and converted her to carry three classes of passengers. She entered service for her new owners for voyages in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Adriatic. Athinai in her Typaldos Line livery appears briefly in a scene of the port of Piraeus, Greece, in the 1963 film The Bullfighter Advances. In 1968 the Typaldos Lines owners were arrested and the company disbanded after the Greek government investigation of the incident found them guilty of manslaughter and negligence. The company's ships were taken over and sold except for two, including SS Athinai, who attracted no buyers and were subsequently laid up at Phaleron Bay. 1968‚Äì89 Athinai laid up in Eleusis, July 16, 1986 Santa Rosa/Athinai never returned to active service. In 1978 she was towed out of layup for use as a film set for Raise the Titanic. After a decade of neglect, and with fittings that did not appear to be out of place on a 1912 built ship, Athinai needed very little conversion work for filming the Titanic's interiors. Her bows were painted to resemble Titanic and she was sprayed with green foam to simulate 68 years on the ocean floor. After the filming she was returned to Phaleron Bay. She remained for another ten years until 1989, when she was towed for scrapping at Aliaƒüa, Turkey in a purge of derelict shipping.

Early life Whitmore was born on 30 May 1829 to a lieutenant in the British Army, stationed in Malta with the Royal Engineers, and his wife. His maternal grandfather was Sir John Stoddart, the Chief Justice of Malta while his paternal grandfather was General Sir George Whitmore. He also had several uncles serving in the British Army. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and then went on to the Staff College. Military career Whitmore entered the British Army in 1847 as an ensign in the Cape Mounted Rifles, a unit serving in South Africa. He fought in the Xhosa Wars the same year and then the Boer insurrection of 1848. He was promoted to lieutenant in May 1850, and was involved in a further conflict with the Xhosa from 1851 to 1853. For a time he was commander of the escort for the Governor of Cape Colony, Sir Harry Smith. He was present at the Battle of Berea, serving as Sir George Cathcart's brigade major. His service in South Africa ended in 1854 and he returned to England. He was accompanied by his wife, Eliza McGlocking, who he had met in 1851. The couple went on to have three children. Promoted to captain in July 1854, Whitmore was posted to the 62nd Regiment of Foot. He went with the regiment to the Crimea where it was serving in the Crimean War. It fought in the Siege of Sevastopol, during which half the officers in his regiment were killed. He later commanded a unit of cavalry, made up of Turkish volunteers. He then performed logistical operations in Austria‚ÄìHungary, Romania, and Russia. Well regarded for his service in the war, he was rewarded with the fourth class of Order of the Medjidie, a Turkish decoration. In 1858, Whitmore attended Staff College but withdrew from his studies on account of health issues. He was later sent to Canada for a time to serve as aide-de-camp to the General Officer Commanding, Canada, Major-General William Eyre. He was able to resume his studies in 1860 and graduated from Staff College with top marks. In 1861 Whitmore was dispatched to New Zealand as military secretary to Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron, the newly appointed commander of British forces in that country. At the time, the British forces were engaged in hostilities with Maori in the Taranaki region. However, when Whitmore and Cameron arrived in New Zealand in March 1861, the conflict had ceased. After 12 months, and frustrated with the lack of opportunities to demonstrate their military abilities, both men tendered their resignation from the British Army; while Cameron's was declined, Whitmore's was accepted. New Zealand On becoming a civilian, Whitmore settled in the Hawke's Bay Region, where he had purchased a farm late the previous year in partnership with another officer of Cameron's staff. Taking over the running of the property from the manager, he set about improving it, using the proceeds from the sale of his commission. Over time, he gradually increased the size of his farm, on which he ran sheep and cattle, through leases on neighbouring land, gradually accumulated a holding of 110,000 acres by 1872. For two year and a half years from March 1863, he was the civil commissioner for Ahuriri and he also turned his hand to politics and became a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council on 31 August 1863. Locally he gained a reputation for gaining personal benefits from his official positions and he often fell out with his business and political colleagues. When the Invasion of the Waikato commenced in July 1863, Whitmore volunteered for Cameron's staff. He was present at the battles of Katikara and Orakau but played no active role in the war. He was also commander of the Hawke's Bay Colonial Defence Force. He left the country for a time in 1865 to visit England. While in London, he married Isabella Smith. His first wife had died a few years previously. There were no children from his second marriage. Tƒ´tokowaru's War In 1866, he successfully led two hundred militia and volunteers at Omaranui, surrounded the gathering Hau Haus, who threatened destruction to the settlement of Napier, and cut off or captured them almost to a man. In 1868 he conducted a campaign against the celebrated Te Kooti, who had just escaped from the Chatham Islands, and drove him and his followers into hiding. A month later he was placed in command of the West Coast force, which had met with some reverses, and had to be recruited and reorganised. For some considerable time Te Kooti kept the country in a state of alarm. His successes brought many wild spirits to his standard, and he placed his fortress at Ngatapa, a wooded mountain whose summit is about two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea. It was said to be the strongest fortified post in the North Island. The massacre at Poverty Bay compelled the Government to send Colonel Whitmore to reduce this stronghold. After a siege of five days the place was taken on 3 January 1869, and the enemy escaped with very severe loss. Returning to the West Coast, he led the colonial troops successfully from Kai Iwi to the Waitara, recovering all the country that had been abandoned and defeating Titokowaru's band in several engagements. Having completely pacified the West Coast, he was sent to put down the insurrection in the Urewera mountains, where Te Kooti had once more raised a body of followers. This duty had been scarcely accomplished when a change in the Ministry occurred. Mr. Fox defeated Mr. Stafford, and at once removed Colonel Whitmore from the command of the troops in the field, just at the moment when complete success appeared close at hand. Te Kooti, being unpursued, was able to recover from the effects of defeat; and it was consequently eighteen months afterwards before he was again reduced to the same straits. In October 1877, Colonel Whitmore joined Sir George Grey's Ministry as Colonial Secretary, retiring in October 1879, with the rest of his colleagues. In 1870 he was appointed C.M.G., and in the 1882 Birthday Honours K.C.M.G. right As a member of the Legislative Council, he was a member of the short-lived Stout-Vogel Cabinet in August 1884, as a Minister without portfolio. The same combination coming back to power in September of the same year, he was appointed commandant of the colonial forces and commissioner of the armed constabulary, with the rank of major-general, conferred for the first time in New Zealand on an officer of the colonial forces. Later life After his resignation, Whitmore returned to his farm and resumed actively managing his estate. He also turned his hand to writing, authoring an account of his experience of the fighting with the Maori. This was published in 1902 as The Last Maori War in New Zealand Under the Self Reliant Policy. On 16 March 1903 Whitmore died in Napier. He had spent the previous few years in poor health after suffering a stroke.

The protoconch is multispiral. The shell is ornamented with nodules which either persist or die out in the outer whorls. The anal notch is shallow. The shell has a distinct interior color layer and well developed constrictions inside the aperture. The anterior end of the shell is blue-black, blue or brown in color. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small to moderate in size. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radular tooth is elongated, and the anterior section of the radular tooth is equal to slightly longer than the length of posterior section. A basal spur is present, and the barb and blade are short. A partially exposed terminating cusp is present. ::Geographical distribution :::The majority of the species in this genus occur in the Indo-Pacific region, and one species occurs in the Eastern-Pacific region.. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on a broad variety of polychaete worms, including enteropneust, eunicid, terebellid, cirratulid, maldanid, and nereid worms, and hemichordates.

It was developed by Premium Agency and published by Square Enix. Gameplay The game uses a top-down visual scheme. Players assume control over the amnesiac robot Leo, controlling his movement using the left thumb stick and aiming and firing using the right thumb stick. Additionally, a dash move can be executed using the left trigger and a shield can be deployed using the right trigger. The player must eliminate all of the enemies on the map, many of which are cube shaped, while avoiding getting hit by projectiles fired by the enemies. Enemies that are killed explode into large gushes of blood-like red oil. Some levels have additional objectives, such as defending a base or surviving with only one life. Players acquire computer chips, the form of in-game currency, by performing well enough in a level to receive a bronze, silver, or gold rating. Chips are spent on upgrades to Leo or to unlock additional levels. Development Yosuke Shiokawa cited Heavy Weapon as an inspiration for the game. The team was not big enough to release the game on multiple platforms. This, combined with the facts that the team did not have market information on either the PlayStation Network or Wiiware, led to the decision to make the title an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive. The title was created by Square's western branch, as the title was designed with a western audience in mind. According to Shiokawa the final title was \\"born jokingly\\" although Shiokawa has admitted to not seeing the humor in it. Reception Prior to its release, Death By Cube was set up for demo play at the Square Enix booth of the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, where several reviewers commented on the game as being exceptionally bloody. Kotaku Australias Stephen Totilo praised the game for requiring more strategy than other twin stick shooters, and remarked that \\"This little game might well have been the bloodiest game at the Tokyo Game Show\\". Death By Cube received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics took issues with multiple aspects of the game, including wildly fluctuating difficulty levels, a threadbare plot, poor visuals, and that additional levels had to be unlocked by grinding through the initial levels. Brett Todd of GameSpot summarized the game by saying that \\"While the action can be gratifyingly frenetic for a few minutes here and there, the overall game design is simplistic and repetitive, the varying difficulty is incredibly frustrating, and the look and sound of the game are too primitive to hold your attention for long.\\" References External links * Category:2010 video games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Square Enix games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Death By Cube"},{"id":"34441486","text":"Responsible Reform, also known as the Spartacus Report, is a report published on 9 January 2012 that analyses the United Kingdom coalition government's proposed welfare benefit changes in the Welfare Reform Bill 2011 that proposes the replacement of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) with Personal Independence Payments (PIP). The report was written, researched, funded and supported by multiple individuals who collaborated via social media, and gathers together existing information and analyses over 500 group responses to the UK Government's response to Disability Living Allowance reform, which were obtained via a freedom of information request.  Claims  The report claims that the Government's response to the DLA consultation presented a highly misleading view of the responses it received, and that the consultation process did not meet the Government's own Codes of Practice. It also notes that the evidence of the consultation did not support the Governments claim of a 30% rise in DLA claims relevant to PIP, rather that the figure is actually 13%, and that these figures were not made clear to parliamentarians as they debated the bill, despite a Government report being signed off in May 2011.  Response  The report has been widely circulated on the social networking service Twitter using the hashtag #spartacusreport. On the date of publication it became a trending topic and has received backing from thousands of users including Stephen Fry, John Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Billy Bragg, Val McDermid, Kate Long, Julie Hesmondhalgh, Sue Perkins and Tim Minchin, as well as various groups including Disability Rights UK, which represents over 350 groups, and Scope, Mind, RNIB, Sense, National Autistic Society, Action for ME and the Papworth Trust. On Monday 9 January, the Department for Work and Pensions press office also responded to the issue on Twitter. On Wednesday 11 January, the House of Lords voted against three clauses in the bill relating to disabled children, cancer patients, and the time limiting of employment support allowance. On Thursday 12 January, disability rights blogger and architect of the report, Sue Marsh, was interviewed on the BBC's current affairs programme Newsnight alongside employment minister Chris Grayling. On Tuesday 17 January, an amendment to hold an independent review of the Welfare Reform Bill was defeated in the House of Lords by 229 votes to 213.

He founded the Pesantren Sukamanah when he was 20. He was awarded the title of National Hero in 1972. Biography Early life and dealing with the Dutch colonial government Zainal Mustafa was born under the name Hudaemi in Singaparna, Tasikmalaya Regency, Dutch East Indies in 1899. He was a santri, an orthodox Javanese Muslim. After attending a standard elementary school, he went on to study at many Islamic schools, which earned him the nickname santri kelana (wandering student). In 1927 he went to Mecca on the hajj; after he returned to Indonesia, he changed his name to Zainal Mustafa. At the age of 20, he founded his own Islamic school named Pesantren Sukamanah. He later served as the Assistant Councillor for the Nahdlatul Ulama branch in Tasikmalaya. Mustafa was fiercely against the Dutch colonialism due to his Islamic beliefs. He was approached several times by the Dutch colonial government and asked to work with them, yet he refused each time. On 17 November 1941, after a period of censorship and being stalked by the secret police, he and fellow kyai Rukhiyat were arrested by the Dutch colonial government and charged with provoking people to rebel against the Dutch. He was jailed for almost two months in Sukamiskin, Bandung. In February 1942 he was arrested again. Japanese occupation, struggle, and death On 31 March 1942, the nineteenth day of Japanese occupation of the Indies, a Japanese officer approached Mustafa in his prison cell in Ciamis, West Java, and promised to release him on condition that he would help the Japanese. After refusing, both he and Rukhiyat were sent back to Sukamanah. During a ceremony at Sukamanah square, Mustafa and his followers refused to bow to honor the Japanese emperor, or . As a result, his pesantren was kept under watch for 3 months. He was also accused by the Japanese government of being insane and perpetuating a cult. The Japanese secret police soon attempted to assassinate Mustafa while he prayed, but missed and hit another devotee. In response to this and increasing instances of Japanese-ordered forced labour, Mustafa formed his own militia and began training for an armed struggle, which he planned to launch on 1 Maulud (25 February 1944). The day before his attack, the Japanese sent an expeditionary force to invite Mustafa to hold negotiations. In response, Mustafa's troops killed all but one of the Japanese soldiers; the surviving soldier was ordered to return to his commander with an ultimatum requiring the sovereignty of Java. On 25 February 1944, the Japanese, totaling six companies of soldiers, two of heihos, one of raiders, and two motorized brigades, besieged Pesantren Sukamanah. Mustafa was arrested in Kampung Cihaus and taken to Batavia (modern day Jakarta), while 120 people died in the siege. After several months of torture Mustafa was executed on 25 October 1944, along with 17 of his followers, but his family only learned of his fate in 1970. His remains were claimed by his family and buried in Sukamanah, Tasikmalaya, on 10 January 1974. Legacy Zainal Mustafa was awarded the title of National Hero of Indonesia title by President Suharto through Presidential Decree number 64 in 1972.

Nelli and workshop, fresco cycle of the Life of the Virgin, 1410-15, San Francesco, Gubbio. Ottaviano Nelli (1375‚Äì1444?) was an Italian painter of the early Quattrocento. Nelli primarily painted frescoes, but also panel paintings. He had several pupils and two painters were influenced by him. Biography He was born in Gubbio in Umbria to the painter Martino Nelli, and was active there and in Perugia (1400), Urbino, Assisi, and Foligno. Among his pupils was his brother Tommaso, Domenico Di Cecco di Baldi, Giovanni Pintali, Giacomo Di Bedo, and Ubaldo Di Matteo.Memorie e guida storica di Gubbio, by Oderigi Lucarelli, Stab. Tipografia Literaria S. Lapi, (1888), Citta di Castello, page 442-445.Memorie storiche di Ottaviano Nelli, pittore Eugubino, illustrate con documenti, (1843) by Luigi Bonfatti. Nelli was \\"consul\\" (a local government representative) for the Sant'Andrea district of Gubbio in 1440 and during the same year, the priors of Perugia had him paint the coat of arms of the duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti with the help of Francesco d'Antonio and Christoforo di Nicoluccio from Perugia. In 1403, he painted Madonna del Belvedere at Gubbio and the Polyptych of Pietralunga. Nelli painted the frescoes of the Trinci Palace in Foligno in 1424. From 1428 to 1432, he was a part of the brotherhood of Santa Croce, Florence and worked on the painting Madonna Crowned by Angels for the church. In 1441, Domenico di Cecco became his pupil and sometime around that year he adopted a son named Mars. His wife Balda died sometime before 1458. Saint Jerome Healing the Lion by Ottaviano Nelli, on panel, Mus√©e du Petit Palais, Avignon The painters Gentile da Fabriano and Giovanni Sanzio were influenced by Nelli. It is believed that Fabriano and Nelli worked together to decorate the church choir of Sant'Agostino, Gubbio. Nelli and his workshop primarily painted frescoes, many of them churches in Gubbio and the nearby cities in Umbria. He painted some easel paintings on panel, but they are rare. One of his easel paintings can be found in the church of Sant'Agostino, Gubbio, but it has been almost entirely repainted. A second similar easel painting is at Montefalco. Austen Henry Layard wrote that Nelli's easel paintings were \\"far inferior to his works in fresco\\". Death Nothing is recorded about Nelli after 1444, and it is presumed that he died during that year. Many local artists who were influenced by him did not become significant. The Gubbian school, which he was a part of, was taken over by the one which Perugino started at Perugia by the end of the 15th century.

It dates in part from the 17th century but was rebuilt in several stages later. The street facade and rear facade are very different, but both are reworkings of a much older building. It is a Grade II* listed building, and has been described in The Buildings of Wales as \\"the most imposing house in the street\\".John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , pp. 409‚Äì410 Part has been the main office of the Monmouthshire Beacon newspaper since 1987. History and architecture The house was constructed in several stages, and occupies the sites of at least three burgages. In 1678 it was known as the Great House and was owned by George Milborne, brother of the recusant George Milborne of Wonastow; in 1699 it was owned by Thomas Brewer, blacksmith. The Duke of Beaufort's agent, Henry Burgh, acquired it and was responsible for building the Queen Anne style frontage facing the fields at Chippenham ‚Äì at the rear of the building as it now appears. Exterior What is now the rear of the building has a whitewashed stone dressing that covers the main red brick construction. It has two-plus-three-plus-two bays, with the central three under a pediment enclosing Diocletian windows and with a rusticated surround. There is a simple but elegant early nineteenth century staircase, and an Adamesque chimney piece with nicely carved timber. A plaque on the outside gives the date of that part of the building as 1752. The secluded walled garden, which the rear of the current building now overlooks, originally contained a grandstand from which the Duke and his friends could watch horse racing on Chippenham fields.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , p.55 Cornwall House lampholder and fence The building now faces Monnow Street. The fa√ßade that looks onto the street is Georgian and shows two floors and an attic, with the building being set behind a railed forecourt. The new frontage was added in 1770, and (slightly later) a porch, fanlights and side doors were added in the late 18th century. The house now has five bays, under a cornice and pedimented porch on slender Doric columns. At some point in the 19th century the house was split into two parts, and the spaces between the house and the neighbouring buildings was filled by two single storey extensions. The one on the left provides access to number 56, which is now the office of the Monmouthshire Beacon newspaper, while the one on the right provides a kitchen to number 58. The street entrance to number 58 retains an elegant lampholder over the gate in the ironwork front fence. Interior Inside the building, the original staircases are still extant, and there is \\"an Adamesque chimneypiece of timber carved with exquisite delicacy\\". Current uses and status A plaque on the front of the building, dated 1837, refers to the Monmouthshire Beacon, a newspaper founded that year. The newspaper moved into the building in 1987, its 150th anniversary year, when Princess Margaret opened its new offices.Monmouthshire Beacon: About Us, accessed 20 January 2012 Number 58, the main part of the house, is privately owned but is regularly open to the public during selected weekends from March to September.

Haigh, hanged in 1949 for his crimes, had wrongly believed that murder could not be proven without the presence of a body. Starring Martin Clunes in the lead role, the film was shot in Scarborough, chosen because its appearance was believed similar to that of London when Haigh lived there during the 1940s and also Saltaire to represent his early life. The film was produced by Yorkshire Television for the ITV network and aired on ITV1 on 9 September 2002. Directed by Harry Bradbeer and written by Glenn Chandler, A Is for Acid also featured among its cast Keeley Hawes and Richard Hope. Plot John George Haigh is raised in a Yorkshire village by sheltering parents who fellowship with the strict Plymouth Brethren. His father teaches him that their family is different from others, being among \\"God's elect\\"; but as an adult John turns to petty crime. He marries Beatrice 'Betty' Hamer, who becomes pregnant with his child. While serving a prison sentence for fraud, Haigh reads about the term corpus delicti, wrongly assuming it means murder cannot be proven without the presence of a body. He subsequently dreams up what he believes to be the perfect murder and experiments by dissolving mice in sulphuric acid. After learning that Betty gave birth to a daughter and moved away, Haigh travels to London upon his release, where he finds employment as an engineer. After being sacked from his job because of a relationship with his boss's daughter, Gillian Rogers, Haigh sets himself up as an inventor. He bumps into a former employer, Donald McSwan, who has a successful property business. Befriending McSwan and his elderly parents, William and Amy, Haigh offers to help them when Donald is conscripted to fight in the Second World War. Donald agrees to Haigh's suggestion that he run the business and take care of his parents while Donald hides out in Scotland for the duration of the war. Haigh then invites Donald to his workshop where he bludgeons his friend to death and places his body in a vat of acid to dissolve, then forges Donald's signature to take control of his affairs. He keeps up the pretense that Donald is on the run through the rest of the war, but as Britain celebrates V.E. Day, Haigh tells William and Amy that Donald has returned to London and is waiting for them at his workshop. He then kills them both after individually driving them there. With the McSwans' money, Haigh sets himself up at the Onslow Court Hotel in Kensington. Haigh's next victims are Archie and Rose Henderson, a doctor and his wife, whom he befriends after visiting a shop they have recently purchased. Dr. Henderson discloses to Haigh that he and Rose are quite wealthy, but their marriage is in difficulty. The couple embark on a make-or- break holiday which is interrupted by Haigh, who invites Archie to his workshop and kills him there. He later lures Rose to the same premises under the pretense that her husband is ill. Rose's brother Arnold Burton is suspicious when Haigh tells them the Hendersons had to leave the country because Archie performed an illegal abortion, and signed over their affairs to Haigh, someone they have only known for a few months. Finally, Haigh kills Olive Durand-Deacon, a fellow Onslow Court resident, when his funds begin to run low. Her friend, Constance Lane, becomes concerned about Olive's disappearance and persuades Haigh to accompany her to the police to report Olive missing. Burton also goes to the police after seeing Haigh's picture in a newspaper article about the missing woman, prompting detectives to launch an investigation. Haigh confesses to killing Olive, saying he dissolved her in acid and therefore cannot be prosecuted for her murder, there being no body. He goes on to confess to the other five murders, and claims another three killings. A Home Office pathologist is called in to examine Haigh's workshop where gallstones and a pelvic bone are recovered. After being convicted of murder, Haigh awaits a death sentence. He is visited by Gillian Rogers, and asks her to visit his parents after he has been hanged. The film ends with Gillian honouring that promise.

Scenes for the forthcoming production would be filmed in locations around Scarborough, particularly the town's South Cliff area, which was believed to resemble Kensington as it had looked during the time Haigh lived there in the 1940s. The article also reported that Yorkshire Television had asked the Scarborough Council for permission to close some roads and the town's Esplanade for filming purposes, but that permission had been refused, so residents were being asked to avoid the area on a voluntary basis. Additional scenes were filmed in Wetherby, Saltaire and outside Hyde Park Picture House, Leeds. The Manchester Evening News carried an interview with Clunes on 9 September 2002, the day the film was aired, in which the actor spoke about the role: \\"I've never been asked to play someone who actually existed before. Haigh was a real challenge. Although he was real he's almost forgotten and my generation didn't really know about him. My mum, on the other hand, can remember the case as a truly horrific event of the last century. When I told an older friend of mine who I was playing, he said he was often told as a child: \`You eat that up or John Haigh will get you.' He was the stock bogeyman of the day.\\" Reception The film was heavily promoted by ITV before its first broadcast at 9:00pm on 9 September 2002, but attracted a relatively small audience for a peak time programme. Overnight figures suggested 6 million viewers had tuned in to watch A Is for Acid, a figure beaten by an episode of Waking the Dead which appeared in the same time slot on BBC One. A review in the Manchester Evening News the day after the film was shown was generally favourable: \\"Clunes might seem an unlikely choice for this sinister and demanding role...but he acquitted tremendously in his portrayal of the beaming, oily trickster with a murderous heart...Clunes made the killer plausible, disarming and businesslike as he went about murdering for profit.\\" However, the reviewer was critical of the film's lack of tension and its failure to analyse Haigh's psyche. Location The opening scene depicting Haigh's childhood was filmed in Saltaire, West Yorkshire. Later where John is shown courting Betty, the Hyde Park Picture House in Hyde Park, Leeds. The police station to which John takes Constance Lane to report her friend missing, was filmed at Wetherby Council Offices.

The episode was co-written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while being directed by Joe Chappelle. Plot Following from \\"Back to Where You've Never Been\\", the alternate universe's Olivia (Anna Torv) and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) track down David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) to a warehouse, unaware that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) had alerted Jones to their arrival. Jones waits until Olivia and Lincoln arrive before destroying one of his beloved shapeshifters, warning that if he's willing to destroy someone he loves, they should fear what he would do to anyone else. He asks to be taken to Fringe headquarters. There, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and the prime universe's Lincoln (Gabel), having been cleared to return to the prime universe, are present when Jones is escorted to an interrogation room. Peter recognizes Jones, whom Peter has killed in his original timeline, and offers to interrogate him; Peter is able to throw Jones off guard, revealing that he knows Jones had crossed over from the prime universe and that his scars showed he'd suffered injuries as a result of being teleported out of prison. Jones makes a demand for a hard drive, containing satellite tracking data, to be returned to him and to let him go or else his agents will launch terrorist attacks; this is demonstrated when one agent sets off a biochemical agent in a hospital ward, killing all inside. They let Jones go after secretly fitting him with a tracking device. However, due to Broyles' interference, Jones is able to elude the tracking system, leaving the prime version of Lincoln suspicious of a mole within Fringe division. Peter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) study the data from the hard drive, and identify that Jones appears to be looking in a nearby quarry for amphilicite, a mineral in appreciable quantities that when processed correctly can create a hole in the universes. Peter realizes too late that the maps are those of the prime universe; Jones has crossed back over with help of his shapeshifter agents there to access the quarry. Peter and Lincoln return to the prime universe to catch up to Jones, but arrive too late as Jones takes a load of the mineral back to the alternate universe. The two Fringe teams meet and agree they must work together to defeat Jones, even though they know that Jones has been ahead of them. Peter recognizes that he knows Jones from the alternate timeline and is a variable that Jones has not accounted for. Later, the viewer is shown that Jones is communicating with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who is preparing an unnamed woman for \\"Phase Two\\" of their plan. Meanwhile, Walternate (John Noble) and his wife Elizabeth (Orla Brady) discuss helping Peter. Elizabeth crosses to the prime universe to meet with Walter (Noble) and to gain his help to assist Peter, which he has been reluctant to do, believing he has been given no sign of absolution for taking Peter from her. Elizabeth assures him that she had forgiven him long ago. Walter returns to Peter that evening and offers Peter his help to return home. Production \\"Enemy of My Enemy\\" was co-written by co-executive producers Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as episode director. Reception Ratings This episode saw an increase in viewership from the lowest ratings of the series. \\"Enemy of My Enemy\\" was watched by an estimated 3.19 million viewers, while the previous two episodes (returning from a winter hiatus) were watched by 2.8 million viewers each. Reviews Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He began his review by calling the season's Peter storyline a \\"bold move,\\" but added that the decision had \\"turned off a lot of critics and fans, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why. One of the reasons we watch a television show (or get invested in any sort of long-form storytelling) is because it‚Äôs fun to care about fictional people... The fourth season of Fringe has, so far as we can tell, left nearly everyone we know behind.\\" Despite this observation, Handlen clarified that \\"the fourth season has actually by and large worked for me,\\" and that he believed \\"Enemy of My Enemy\\" to be a \\"fun, thrilling piece of work, with plenty of solid emotional scenes to help ground the action sequences.\\" The reviewer also enjoyed seeing Harris' return, especially as it added a \\"non-Walternate villain [to] help keep the current story arc from\\" repeating past universe conflicts.

The Legislative Council was New Zealand's upper house and existed from 1853 until its abolition in 1950. Initially appointed for life, tenure was changed to seven-year terms in 1891 for new appointments. New Zealand had 330 members of the Legislative Council, five of whom were women. Twice during its existence, in 1885 and 1950, membership peaked at 53 councillors; on the second occasion due to the so-called suicide squad that the National Government appointed to ensure that members voted for the abolition of the Legislative Council. Appointment and tenure Members of the New Zealand Legislative Council in 1894 The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 provided for councillors to be appointed for life terms by the Governor. The first appointments were made by Governor George Grey in 1853, who chose from three broad groups: a 'prestige' group (e.g. wealthy runholders or nobility), a group with previous political experience, and a group of officials. Captain Bellairs, Major Lloyd, Dr Ralph Richardson, and Henry William Petre belonged to the first group. The second group was made up of Henry Seymour (who had been a nominee of the Legislative Council of New Munster, which never met), whilst John Salmon and Frederick Whitaker represented the Legislative Council of New Ulster. William Swainson, Henry St. Hill, Mathew Richmond, and William Kenny were previous officials and represented the third group. John Salmon, William Swainson and Frederick Whitaker were the first three appointments (on 26 May 1853), and Mathew Richmond was appointed on 23 June 1853. The remaining appointments in 1853 were made on 31 December. The quorum of the Legislative Council was fixed at five, and there was no initial upper limit of positions. Instructions received by the governor in 1855 contained an upper limit of 15 positions, which was increased to 20 in 1861, and removed altogether in 1862. As the power of the Governor over New Zealand politics gradually decreased, it became the convention that appointments were made on the recommendation of the Premier (later Prime Minister), essentially meaning that councillors were selected by the government of the day. This change in practice happened during the 1860s and was certainly established by 1867. Tenure was changed by the Liberal Government to seven years; both political factions had campaigned in the for a reform of the Legislative Council. The outgoing Atkinson Ministry made six appointments to the Legislative Council in January 1891 (Harry Atkinson, James Fulton, John Davies Ormond, William Downie Stewart, John Blair Whyte, and Charles John Johnston), and these were the last life appointments. The regulations were that members were disqualified when they had missed two sessions without absence having been granted. This applied mainly to the period from 1854 to 1891, when 17 members were disqualified. The rules were applied in a rather lax fashion, though, and in 1887 it was alleged that several members were technically disqualified, including the Attorney-General. The handling of the affair damaged the reputation of the Legislative Council. The maximum size of the Legislative Council of 53 councillors was reached in 1885 and again in 1950. Over the years, the Legislative Council was stacked by the government of the day with members sympathetic to it, so that legislation could be passed more easily. The appointments by the second Stout‚ÄìVogel Ministry in 1884 and 1885 made the Legislative Council reach its maximum number on the first occasion. The so-called suicide squad appointed by the First National Government to ensure the abolition of the Legislative Council was the reason for achieving the maximum size on the second occasion. The Legislative Council was abolished in 1950 (memberships all terminated on 31 December 1950), with the Legislative Council Abolition Bill coming into force on 1 January 1951. Captain Baillie served on the Legislative Council for 61 years and had the longest membership. The Legislative Council had a Speaker, and from 1865 a Chairman of Committees; these roles were modelled on the equivalent functions in the New Zealand House of Representatives. There were 18 Speakers and 13 Chairmen of Committees, respectively. William Swainson was the first Speaker, whilst Mathew Richmond was the first Chairmen of Committees. Four New Zealand Premiers or Prime Ministers were head of government while they a member of the Legislative Council. Two of those, Frederick Whitaker and Francis Bell, were at other times also Members of Parliament. The other two, George Waterhouse and Daniel Pollen, were not at other times also Member of Parliament; they only served on the Legislative Council. The Statutes Amendment Act (1941) allowed for women to be appointed to the Legislative Council. The first two women, Mary Anderson and Mary Dreaver, were appointed in 1946 by the First Labour Government. Three more women were appointed in 1950 as part of the suicide squad: Agnes Louisa Weston, Cora Louisa Burrell, and Ethel Marion Gould. Thus, of the 330 legislative councillors that were appointed over its 97 years of existence, only five were women, with three of them there to abolish the Legislative Council. List of members  Over the 97 years of its existence, 330 members served on the Legislative Council.

The bridge spans the canalized mouth of the Don River where it empties into Toronto Harbour. It is the fourth bridge at that location.  History  The City of Toronto government once operated a swing bridge over the Keating Channel at or near Cherry Street. The current bridge, constructed in 1968, is a vehicle and pedestrian bascule bridge, with a metal mesh deck. The original swing bridge was made of wood, and only carried a single rail line, operated by the Grand Trunk Railway. The City solicited a bid for the first swing bridge in 1896. Contractors were allowed to propose either a metal or wood bridge. The Privy Council of Canada approved funding of the bridge in 1900. The two spans were long, which was considered sufficient to accommodate navigation on the river.\\" The wooden bridge was replaced by steel draw bridges in 1912 and 1932. As originally constructed the bridge supported two lanes of traffic in each direction, and had a sidewalk on the west side. In 1995, several changes were made to provide \\"enhanced safety for cyclists, skaters and pedestrians.\\" As built the entire deck of the bridge, including the sidewalk, was a steel mesh. In 1995 vehicle traffic was restricted to one lane in each direction to make room for a sidewalk on the east side of the bridge, and the expansion of the sidewalk on the west side to so it could accommodate bicycles as well as pedestrians. The sidewalks were faced with a non-slip plastic fibreglass surface. In 2006, an inspection showed that the bridge required million in repairs to corrosion damage. The repairs were completed in April 2007. Key bearings in the bridge broke in 2010; it took time for replacement bearings to be found in Sweden. The bridge wasn't restored to working order until June 27, 2011. On August 1, 2019, the bridge failed to lower. It remained locked in its upright position for several weeks. A crane was used to lower the bridge to the horizontal position. The bridge is currently under repair. Future The City of Toronto government's long term plans are to \\"renaturalize\\" the mouth of the Don River. Under this plan the Keating Channel will be retained, due to its historic value, but a new more natural appearing channel would be constructed south of the Keating Channel. There are plans to replace the bridge. File:A wooden swing bridge over the Keating Channel in 1910.jpg|Wooden swing bridge over the Keating Channel in 1910.

However, she is most notable for being the first official carillonist of the National War Memorial Carillon in Wellington.  Early life  Gladys Watkins was born in Akaroa, North Canterbury, New Zealand in 1884. Her parents, Elizabeth Pavitt and Stephen Watkins, were both born in England. Gladys Watkins was educated in Wellington, where she attended Miss Freeman's School, located first in Ellice Street, Mount Victoria, and later in Woolcombe Street (The Terrace), where it became known as Chilton House. The details of Watkins's early musical training are unknown, but by the second decade of the twentieth century she was a prominent member of Wellington's musical community, performing as a pianist and singer. Alongside numerous piano and vocal recitals, and choral concerts, Watkins was part of an ensemble that provided concerts for the officers and men at the YMCA Hall at the Trentham Camp during World War I.  Travel to Belgium  Watkins achieved national prominence in the late 1920s. The government had approved funds of ¬£100,000 to construct a national war memorial, but what form it should take was vehemently contested. A local jeweller, P. N. Denton believed that a carillon, its bells dedicated to the Fallen, would be an appropriate memorial. Despite the government's reluctance, a group of Wellington residents formed the Wellington War Memorial Carillon Society in 1926, with the aim of raising money by public subscription for its bells. A portion of funds were set aside for Watkins to travel to Belgium, to study carillon with one of its foremost exponents, Jef Deyn. In 1929, Watkins travelled to Malines (Mechelen) in Belgium to study with Deyn, the founder of the Royal Carillon School. Watkins achieved her diploma in the record time of eighteen months. A report in the Auckland Star noted on 30 July 1930 that 'Miss Gladys Watkins of Wellington, the official carilloneur of the New Zealand bells ... has a secured a diploma with distinction at Malines, Belgium.' Her progress in Europe was reported in the New Zealand press, as was her subsequent recital tour. While Watkins was studying for her diploma in Belgium, planning for the construction of the Carillon continued. The bells for the Wellington were the responsibility of the foundry of Gillett & Johnston in Croydon. The finished bells were taken on tour, first to Newcastle and then to Hyde Park, where Watkins gave a demonstration recital on 24 December 1929. The report in the Evening Post recorded that Watkins was 'warmly ovationed by large crowds of Christmas shoppers .... The police had to clear the way for Miss Watkins through the mass of appreciative listeners.'  Return to Wellington  By December 1930, Watkins was on her way home to New Zealand. She arrived in Wellington in late 1930 or early 1931, and on 21 January 1931 was a guest at the Pioneer Club. During the reception, Watkins gave a talk about her experiences in Belgium, the history of carillon music in Europe and England, and the construction and tuning of carillon bells. In Watkins's view, according to the report, carillon music was unequallyed 'as an expression of patriotism, loyalty, and fine sentiment ... it touched the hearts of the people in a way that nothing else in the way of music could do.'  Consecration of the War Memorial Carillon  On Anzac Day, 25 April 1932, Watkins participated in the Consecration Ceremony of the National War Memorial and War Memorial Carillon, alongside her London colleague, Clifford E. Ball. While Ball played several hymns and pieces during the main ceremony that began at 2.30pm, Watkins performed during the recital that took place at 7.30pm.  Later career  Until Gladys Watkins retired from her role as Wellington's carilloneur in 1936, as a result of poor health, she had performed more than 300 recitals on the instrument. Her repertoire included a variety of hymns, transcriptions, and original compositions, some of her own creation. According to the Evening Post, a recital on 29 May 1932 included several hymns (At Even 'ere the Sun was Set, and Eternal Father, Strong to Save), and her own Prelude on the Scale of C. Her original compositions are still known today: Watkins's Festival Prelude forms part of the repertoire list for the Associate Carillonneur Exam of the Guild of Carilloneurs in North America. Gladys Watkins died on 31 October 1939, at her home in Kelburn, Wellington. At 3pm on 5 November 1939, a recital in honour of Gladys Watkins was given by 'automatic player' on the National War Memorial Carillon. The programme consisted only of works or arrangements by Watkins herself: Changes on Eight Bells; I Waited for the Lord; My True Love Hath My Heart; Bells of St Mary's; Nearer My God to Thee; The Bells of Scotland - Men of Harlech - Vicar of Bray; The Last Rose of SummerSilver Threads Among the Gold; Oh God Our Help in Ages Past; God Defend New Zealand; The National Anthem.

R. Evans Patent 1868 The Evans Repeating Rifle was a lever-action repeating rifle designed by Warren R. Evans as a high capacity rifle. Overview The Evans Repeater is often considered to be one of the oddest rifles to ever be produced in the United States. The Evans was invented by Warren R. Evans, a dentist from Thomaston, Maine. With the help of his brother George, they perfected the rifle and started the \\"Evans Rifle Manufacturing Company\\" of Mechanic Falls, Maine in 1873. Their rifles were marketed by Merwin & Hulbert. The hope was that the rifle would be issued by the United States Army, but the rifle failed the standard dust test. It was then offered as a sporting rifle. The rifle has a radial block receiver similar to the Spencer, but the rounds were fed from an Archimedean-screw magazine which formed the spine of the rifle stock and could hold up to 28 rounds. The fluted cartridge carrier made a quarter turn each time the lever was operated, feeding a new cartridge into the breech. The round was unique to the rifle and hard to find. The mechanism of the rifle was not very sturdy and did not do well with such things as dust. Nevertheless, the Evans Repeating Rifle has lately become something of a collector's item and prices are going up. The Evans Repeating Rifle Company went bankrupt in December 1879, a victim of the post war arms glut and keen competition. A total of almost 15,000 Evans repeating rifles were produced between 1873 and 1879. A good portion of these survive, and a number are advertised in various antique arms publications. The rifle was the only firearm mass-produced in the state of Maine in the 19th century. In the 20th and 21st century, many firearms were, and are, mass- produced in Maine, including those by Bushmaster, General Dynamics, Smith & Wesson and Windham Weaponry. The Evans rifle also had the greatest magazine capacity of any rifle mass-produced in the 19th Century. Design In terms of basic design, the Evans repeating rifle is similar to the Spencer Repeating Rifle. However, the Evans has a rotary helical magazine in the buttstock, and cartridges are fed into the breech by cycling the cocking lever/trigger guard. Also, the magazine of the Evans has a much higher capacity than that of the Spencer, up to 28 rounds. The Evans holds four rows of cartridges which are loaded through a trapdoor in the buttplate. Each time the action is cycled, the magazine feeds the next cartridge to the breech in a helical pattern. Old model The first model of the rifle, commonly called the old model, was in production from 1873 to 1876. This model differs from later models mainly in that it has no lower buttstock, only an upper one. This means that the magazine tube is exposed along the bottom of the stock. In addition, the ejection port has no dust cover. Approximately 500 old models were produced. The first 200 of these have no cocking lever retaining stud on the underside of the magazine tube. Old models made after the first 200 have a stud or locking nut to hold the cocking lever in place. The barrels of the old models are marked ‚ÄúEvans Repeating Rifle/Pat. Dec 8, 1868 & Sept. 16, 1871‚Äù. Old model Evans rifles were made in the following configurations: * Sporting Rifle: :Walnut stock, checkering and engraving available on special order. 26‚Äù, 28‚Äù and 30‚Äù octagon barrels. Estimated quantity made - 300. * Military musket: :30‚Äù round barrel, full forend retained with 2 barrel bands. Estimated quantity made - 50. * Carbine: :22‚Äù round barrel, short forend retained with a single barrel band. Sling swivels. Estimated quantity made - 150. Transition model By early 1876, Evans modified the original and began producing the so- called Transition model. Unlike the old model, the transition model had a walnut lower buttstock, as well as a redesigned buttplate. These changes improved the balance of the rifle, as well as protecting it from damage. Barrel markings on the transition model are as follows: ‚ÄúEvans Repeating Rifle Mechanic Falls Me./Pat, Dec. 8, 1868 & Sept. 16, 1871‚Äù. it is unknown if these were Evans short or Evans long Transition model Evans rifles were made in the following configurations: * Sporting Rifle: :Walnut stock, checkering and engraving available on special order. 26‚Äù, 28‚Äù and 30‚Äù octagon barrels. Estimated quantity made - 1050. * Military musket: :30‚Äù round barrel, full forend retained with 2 or 3 barrel bands. Estimated quantity made - 150. * Carbine: :22‚Äù round barrel, short forend, single barrel band, sling swivels. Estimated quantity made - 450. * Montreal Carbine: :A rare variation believed to have been sold in Canada by Ralph H. Kilby. A sporting goods dealer in Montreal and Evans‚Äô Canadian agent. Estimated quantity made - less than 100. New model The company received numerous testimonials from its customers. One of the more colorful ones allegedly came from Kit Carson, Jr. Kit Carson Jr. (no relation to the original Kit Carson) was the stage name of Jim Spleen from Kansas, who appeared with Buffalo Bill. Testimonials like this were great advertising and highly sought after by all the arms companies. The Evans repeater was also used by William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody and his friend and stage partner Texas Jack Omohundro, who said \\"It shoots like a house on fire! I can clean out a whole band of Indians alone with it. I shall recommend them wherever I go.\\" Requests soon reached the factory from the far west for a more powerful cartridge. George Evans listened and then went to work. The new cartridge together with numerous improvements in the design were combined to make the new model Evans repeating rifle. By the summer of 1877 the new model was perfected and put into production. The new model is easily distinguished by its larger, more robust receiver and sliding dust cover over the ejection port. The front edge of the receiver is cut straight not scalloped as in the old and transition models. The new model was chambered for a 1 ¬Ω‚Äù long .44 caliber cartridge case. Previous models used a 1‚Äù long case of the same caliber. The increased length of the new cartridge necessitated a reduction in magazine capacity to only 26 rounds. Barrel markings are the same as the transition model except with the addition of ‚ÄúU.S.A.‚Äù. New model Evans rifles were made into the following configurations: * Sporting Rifle: :Walnut stock, checkering and engraving available on special order. 26‚Äù, 28‚Äù and 30‚Äù octagon barrels. Estimated quantity made - 3,000. * Military musket: :30‚Äù round barrel, full forend retained with 2 barrel bands, many converted to sporting rifle. Estimated quantity made - 3,000. * Carbine: :22‚Äù round barrel, short forend retained by a single barrel band, occasionally with a bayonet mounting stud. Estimated quantity made - 4,000 plus. * ‚ÄúEvans Sporting Rifle‚Äù marked rifles: Rifles found with this instead of the usual markings are believed to have been assembled from parts. These were mostly 30‚Äù round barrel military muskets which had a short forend attached with a screw. This forend is quite different from the usual sporting forend. Calibers When Warren Evans designed his rifle he also had to design his own cartridge. What he came up with is now known as the .44 Evans short. This is noted in the factory catalogs as being a 1‚Äù shell. The original cartridges were loaded with 33 grains of black powder and a 220 grain lead bullet. This gave a velocity of about 850 fps. The more common new model Evans rifle used the 1.5‚Äù case. This was known as the ‚Äú.44 New Model‚Äù cartridge. The original cartridges were loaded with 40 to 43 grains of black powder and lead bullets ranging from 275 to 300 grains. With a 280 grain bullet velocity was about 1200 fps. Both cartridges were loaded by Winchester up to the early 1920s. Movies * Used by Wilford Brimley as Joe Gill in Crossfire Trail (2001) * Used by Forrie J.

Born in England, he migrated to New Zealand circa 1880, and settled in Whanganui. Ward was a pioneer New Zealand telescope maker, instrumental in establishing both the Wanganui Astronomical Society, and the Wanganui Observatory.  Early life  Joseph Thomas Ward was born in Chelsea, London, England, on 25 January 1862, the son of Mary Sarah Clark and Francis Ward, a licensed victualler. He was educated for the Catholic priesthood but abandoned this idea and migrated to New Zealand, where he worked for several years as a shepherd and shearer in Marlborough, and as a saddler in Wellington. On 12 October 1894, he married Ada Evelyn Wright (at the residence of the bride‚Äôs father). The married couple moved to Whanganui, where Ward first opened a lending library, and later, a bookshop and stationery business, ‚ÄòBook Nook‚Äô.  Wanganui Astronomical Society and Wanganui Observatory  In April 1901, a brilliant comet appeared in the New Zealand evening skies.The Great Comet of 1901 was observed by Ward with a telescope he'd installed in his own business premises. Ward had installed a 4¬Ω inch equatorially mounted refractor in a small observatory at the back of his business premises, and from the report in the Wanganui Herald of 3 May, it would appear that this was the first view Wanganui residents had of the Great Comet of 1901. The number of people who came to view the comet through this telescope, gave Ward the idea of forming a small society of interested persons. A few week's later, Prof. Richard Maclaurin of the then Victoria College gave a lecture on Comets at the Wanganui Museum Hall. He suggested at Ward's request, that anyone who was interested in forming an Astronomical Society, remain behind after the talk. The first meeting was held at the Wanganui Technical School on the corner of the Avenue and Guyton street, and at the following meeting, the Wanganui Astronomical Society was formed, with Joseph Ward elected president. One of the first decisions of the new society was that a telescope of fairly large dimensions be obtained and an observatory be established. Ward led a deputation to the Wanganui Borough Council requesting a site at Cook's Gardens; the council granted this at their meeting of 27 August 1901. After careful research by Ward, the Wanganui Astronomical Society decided in November 1901, to order a 20¬Ω-in Calver Reflector, from the English Firm, Banks & Co. The full cost of this telescope was to be ¬£450, and a partial payment of ¬£400 had already been despatched to England when a cable arrived to cancel the sale ‚Äì it had apparently been agreed to without the agreement of Mr Chatwood, the current owner. Conveniently, Chatwood also had a 9¬Ω-in Cooke refractor, which was originally owned by Isaac Fletcher and it was this instrument that he offered to the Society for the ¬£400 already received. The telescope, according to Chatwood, was worth far in excess of the 20¬Ω-in Calver Reflector, and although the purchase price grew to ¬£450 after the request for some improvements and additional equipment, the Society had \\"got itself a bargain\\". At their 2 May 1902 meeting, the Wanganui Astronomical Society voted to accept the offer, and the telescope was duly dismantled and shipped to New Zealand on the S. S. Indravedi. The 9¬Ω-in refractor was installed in the newly constructed Wanganui Observatory, which was officially opened by Premier Richard Seddon on 25 May 1903. The telescope is still the largest unmodified telescope of its type in the North Island of New Zealand. In the Astronomical Society‚Äôs heyday, Joseph Ward was Honorary Director of the Observatory. With his assistant, Thomas Allison, he catalogued over 200 double stars, 88 of which are still recognised as 'Ward doubles'. In 1926 the astronomical society gifted the observatory, debt free, to the Wanganui City Council in trust for the citizens of Wanganui. It is now known as the Ward Observatory.  Astronomical Educator and Telescope maker  In the 20 June 1918 edition of the Wanganui Herald, Ward reported on a new star, 'Nova Aquilae', which he and his observatory assistant, Thomas Allison, had observed on the evening of 10 June. It had been observed in England and on the Continent of Europe on the evening of the 9th. Ward expressed regret that they had not a star spectroscope of adequate power with which to bring out the star's spectrum, but nonetheless was able to provide a detailed description. In 1919, an American solar authority, Professor Albert F. Porta, was quoted in a San Francisco newspaper as predicting terrible storms due to a great sunspot. Ward‚Äôs opinion was duly sought, and his response was that there was \\"No need to lose sleep\\". Ward also said, Ward responded point by point to Professor Porta‚Äôs predictions, finishing with the statement, Through his lectures, his public open nights at the observatory and his weekly column in The Wanganui Herald, Ward made astronomy accessible to the general public. He frequently gave talks to the Wanganui Philosophical Society, of which he held the position of vice president and in September 1926, he delivered the Thomas Cawthron Memorial Lecture on the topic of 'the wonders of the universe'. The previous year‚Äôs speaker had been Sir Ernest Rutherford. Ward was also a pioneer New Zealand telescope maker, and the 20-inch refractor telescope he installed in his own home was recognised in 1927, as the best instrument in the Southern Hemisphere. Ward built reflecting telescopes of 8 and 12 inch aperture which were often sold to other New Zealand amateur astronomers merely for the cost of the materials used to make them. Joseph Ward died in Wairoa, on 4 January 1927. He had developed appendicitis while visiting a daughter, and after being operated on, succumbed to peritonitis. He was survived by his wife, four sons and three daughters. In the obituary published by the British Astronomical Association, which Ward had joined on 18 October 1898, he is referred to as having the rare combination of ‚Äòastronomer of philosophical mind and mechanical genius‚Äô.

Waitoa's ordination as deacon at St Paul's, Auckland, on 22 May 1853, was the first ordination of a MƒÅori into the Anglican church. He was baptised Rota (Lot) on 17 October 1841 by the Rev. Octavius Hadfield at the Waikanae Mission of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). When Bishop George Selwyn visited in November 1842 Waitoa volunteered to accompany him on his journey back to the Te Waimate mission. From 1843 he attended St. John‚Äôs College at Te Waimate mission and then in Auckland when Bishop Selwyn moved St John‚Äôs College to Tamaki. He became master of the junior department of the Maori boys' school and a catechist. In 1848 he was stationed at Te Kawakawa (Te Araroa), East Cape. Iharaira Te Houkamau opposed his appointment because he considered it an insult to his dignity to have a MƒÅori catechist whose people he looked upon as bitter enemies. However Te Houkamau eventually accepted Waitoa and Te Houkamau offered himself as a candidate for baptism. Waitoa was ordained as a deacon at St Paul's Church, Auckland, on 22 May 1853 and was licensed to the mission district of Te Kawakawa. He was ordained a priest on 4 March 1860 by Bishop William Williams, and appointed to Te Kawakawa. Raniera Kawhia joined Waitoa at Te Kawakawa after he was ordained deacon in February 1860.

He is better known as the victim of an unsolved murder.  Life  Joseph Bowne Elwell was the son of Joseph E. Elwell, a student at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, and worked as an insurance agent as a teenager. Elwell learned the new card game \\"bridge\\"‚Äînow called bridge whist or straight bridge to distinguish it from later versions‚Äîin the course of establishing a young men's club in church, where its play was a popular activity. His fascination with the card game took over his life. Elwell married Helen Derby, who also liked the game. She was socially well-connected, as her cousin Richard Derby was the husband of Ethel Roosevelt. Elwell's other social connections included his auction bridge partner Harold Stirling Vanderbilt. Such connections provided him with affluent students and with gambling opportunities; he became wealthy enough ultimately to own property in Palm Beach, Florida, twenty horses, five cars, and a yacht. Elwell also took a fancy to some of his female students and acquaintances, and developed a reputation as a womanizer. By 1916 Elwell's wife took their son Richard and filed for separation; by 1920 she was negotiating a divorce.  Murder  In the early morning hours of June 11, 1920, Elwell was murdered with a gunshot to the head from a .45 automatic in his locked house. The murder has never been solved. A 1921 confession was determined to be the false utterance of a deranged man. The crime generated considerable publicity: The New York Times covered it almost daily until the end of July, the Chicago Tribune published eighteen articles, and the Los Angeles Times published twelve. This classic \\"locked room murder\\" was the inspiration for S.S. Van Dine's mystery novel The Benson Murder Case (1926), which introduced his famous fictional detective Philo Vance. According to a review by Kirkus Reviews, Jonathan Goodman's 1987 book The Slaying of Joseph Bowne Elwell fails in its attempted resolution. \\"Goodman's conclusion can only remain a supposition in a case that is still important largely as the seedbed for the detective novels of both S.S.

Wahanui was born probably in the late 1820s. His father was Te Ngohi-te-arau, also known as Te Huatare, of NgƒÅti Maniapoto. His mother was Tarati, who belonged to NgƒÅti Waiora of Mokau and came from the Piopio area. Wahanui was raised in the Waipa Valley as a Christian, and attended the Wesleyan Native Institution at Three Kings College in Auckland, afterwards returning to Te Kopua to live with his people. In the late 1850s Wahanui organised a mail service between Te Awamutu and Napier, and set up a tribal administration and law enforcement system which attracted the positive attention of John Gorst. He also participated in debates around the setting up of the MƒÅori King Movement. Wahanui's wife, Te Wairingiringi, by Kate Sperrey, 1930s. Wahanui became increasingly opposed to PƒÅkehƒÅ institutions and government, and fought at Pukekohe, ≈årƒÅkau, and was wounded at Hairini during February when the colonial government and British forces invaded the Waikato in 1863‚Äì64. After the war ended he became an important leader of NgƒÅti Maniapoto and a principal adviser to the MƒÅori King, TƒÅwhiao. He was opposed to NgƒÅti Maniapoto and Waikato selling land, but he and fellow NgƒÅti Maniapoto leaders Rewi Maniapoto and Taonui eventually realised the inevitability of their territory, the King Country, being opened to PƒÅkehƒÅ. In the early 1880s, he invented the MƒÅori King's Tarahou - a device which signifies the dawn. Wahanui, Rewi and Taonui signed a petition which was presented to Parliament in June 1883; they criticised the government for legislation which ran contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi. In April 1884, Wahanui was approached by Robert Stout who, according to Wahanui, had promised that no hotels would be built, no liquor would be sold, and no land courts would operate in the NgƒÅti Maniapoto area as long as land would be provided for a new railway that would run between Auckland and Wellington. He was also given a gold medallion which would allow his family free travel via the railway for a few generations, but every promise made by Stout was ignored by the Government. He was later offered a seat in the Legislative Council, but did not take it up. Wahanui married Te Wairingiringi from Kawhia before May 1884. Their children including Tuwhangai, Hounuku, and Tuaarau were all adopted. One of their grandsons was Te Apaapa Kaweni Maniapoto of Otorohanga.

History  The Federation of MalayaMalaysia did not come into existence until 1963. and Syria established diplomatic relations in 1958. Syria established their embassy at Kuala Lumpur in 2001, while the Malaysian embassy in Damascus was established in 2002. President Bashar al-Assad visited Malaysia in 2003, with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin visiting Syria in the same year. In 2005, Syria's relations with the west weakened after it suffered a series of economic and political sanctions, such as the US recalling their ambassador from Damascus. This saw Syria respond with an increased focus on developing ties both with their existing allies Iran and Russia, and with eastern nations, especially China, India and Malaysia. As a fellow nation where most of the population is Muslim, Malaysia has been a particular beneficiary of these efforts. Some Syrian elites have begun sending their children to learn English in Malaysia, rather than traditional destinations in the west. While relations between Syria and the West partially improved from about 2006, and especially after President Obama took office in 2009, Syria has continued to further develop ties with Malaysia. Efforts to increase trade between the two countries included a 2007 visit to Syria by Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, and the signing of several agreements in 2009 relating to air travel and the SME sector.

Formerly an independent municipality, the area surrounding Akasia is largely semi-rural and Akasia itself is built on former agricultural holdings. History The first suburb to be built in Akasia is The Orchards. The Orchards was established as a residential township in 1904 and an old Dutch-Reformed church was in the center of the neighborhood. As the city of Pretoria grew in light of industrial expansion in the 1960s more houses were constructed in the northern semi-rural holdings today known as Akasia. The turning point in the urban development of Akasia was the establishment of the Roslyn industrial complex in the early 1970s. Roslyn became a significant industrial complex, housing large industrial corporations such as Nampak, BMW, South African Breweries and Nissan. With the growth of the manufacturing complex came a need for a large skilled and semi-skilled workforce nearby and by the late 1970s the small agricultural holdings in the area were being purchased and transformed into residential offerings with tree lined streets and green parks. The town attained municipal status in 1984, before losing it as part of the post-apartheid reorganisation of local governments, and being incorporated into the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. With a success in the sale of housing in The Orchards, there was a plan to build more similar suburban style houses for the large population of artisans and technicians. Soon suburbs such as Karenpark, Amandasig, Theresapark, Ninapark, Clarina, Hesteapark, Flourana, and Chantelle were built. Demographics The area's population grew from a mere 400 in the 1950s to over 60,000 in the 2011 census. The people of Akasia were up until the early 1990s mainly white Afrikaans-speaking people. Since the advent of democracy in South Africa, the area has transformed to represent the demographics of the greater area Pretoria North. A development that has arisen in the social construct of the area is the influx of people from other parts of the African continent bringing with them a new cultural flavor to the area. Small Somali shops and Congolese hairdressers have given the largely culturally monogamous area a new traditional dynamic. The relationship between the African migrants and local South Africans in the Akasia area is relatively good as the population in Akasia is well educated and levels of unemployment are low. With an increase in population came an increase in the demand for other support services such as schools, health care facilities, municipal offices, filling stations, shopping and entertainment centers and religious institutions. As a result of these developments, Akasia has changed its character as a dormitory town and is developing a vibe of a more cosmopolitan city of its own. Economy The area has a growing young population of graduate professionals who are flocking to the cosmopolitan complexes in the Karen Park and Theresapark areas, which brings with it more need for business development and expansion in numerous industries. The area in Karenpark north of the Wonder Park Shopping Mall has great potential for commercial development. Office space, high end residential and entertainment offerings in the area will be a very good option for investors in the property development space. Soon the character of Akasia will move from that of a residential area to that of a cosmopolitan development node with glass-draped sky-scrapers and an inter-national appeal. Key features include the Wonder Park Shopping Centre, the Winternest train station and drivers testing station, schools such as Hoerskool Akasia, Hoerskool Gert-Marits, Laerskool Theresapark, Laerskool Akasia, Amandasig secondary school and Charlton Force college. The area is home to two world class golf courses: the Hillside Golf Course in Nina Park and the Thornbrook Golf Estate in Theresapark. Culture and contemporary life The area is not known for having a busy nightlife as its inhabitants are largely conservative families but over the years, the existence of News Cafe Karen park, Mogomotsi Country lodge next the Mabopane Highway and the Gaabo Motho party Lodge in Amandasig have added a vibrant feel to the area's nightlife.

First Night Game at Adelaide Oval The company was responsible for the first electric lighting system ever installed at Adelaide Oval, for an Australian Rules football match between Adelaide and South Adelaide on 1 July 1885 commencing 8pm. The company supplied six electric arc- lamps, three on either side of the ground, and having two steam-powered dynamos for each three. Four lamps were 1,000 candle-power of Brush manufacture and two of 2,000 candle-power by Siemens. The lamps were mounted on 30-feet poles equally spaced around the Oval just outside the boundary flags. The game was well attended but the illumination proved inadequate for a full enjoyment of the game (especially when the ball's white paint wore off!) and there were momentary lamp failures. Adelaide won the game 1 goal 8 behinds to 8 behinds. Memorabilia The old hand pump on display in the Market Square in Burra and a crane displayed at Port Adelaide were products of the company. A display of gold mining equipment in Pine Creek, Northern Territory features a company advertisement of the period.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its significance in engineering and transport. With History of area In early Wisconsin, before there were railroads or good wagon roads through the forests, there were rivers. Indians traveled on the rivers; explorers followed; traders paddled their goods on them. Most significant, the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers nearly connected the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and the middle of North America. By the 1840s people were thinking that this connection on the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers, with only a short portage between the two, could be developed into a channel of commerce - a new Erie Canal - opening the Midwest to development, and profiting those along its path. But parts of the natural Fox River could be traversed only by canoe, and not many buffalo hides or wheat could be hauled in a canoe. The biggest rapids was at Kaukauna, where the river dropped 50 feet in the course of a mile, requiring a long portage with even a canoe, and blocking a larger cargo vessel. Construction In 1848 Congress arranged a land grant to finance the improvement of navigation on the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. In 1851 Wisconsin's Board of Public Works contracted for locks and a dam to be built around the rapids at Kaukauna, but by 1853 this wasn't done and the money was exhausted. The project was turned over to a private venture, the Fox River Improvement Company, and it got the land grant expanded. This organization made headway, and in 1856 a steamship managed to traverse up the Wisconsin and down the Fox to Green Bay. Still, the channels weren't deep enough to make shipping practical. The Company went bankrupt and the project foundered again. In 1872 the federal government took control of the project. By this time the Kaukauna complex consisted of a 7400-foot canal, five wooden locks, and a wooden dam 583 feet long and six feet high. The Army Corps of Engineers decided to rebuild most parts in stone and concrete. This work began in 1880, and the old dam was finally replaced with concrete in 1932. With that, the lock and dam system was complete as seen today, including these components: * The canal itself was excavated in the 1850s and dredged repeatedly since. It is 7,000 feet long and no more than six feet deep. Its width varies from 100 to 250 feet, with the wide spots allowing vessels to pass each other. * Near the top of the canal is the dam - 603 feet long and rebuilt of concrete in 1931 and 1932. The pool created by the dam floods the canal to operate the locks. Each end of the dam has a 24-foot spillway. The middle section has eight sluiceways, each with a Tainter gate. The gates are all operated by an electrical winch which slides on a track from gate to gate - known as the \\"crab.\\" * The guard lock at the upstream end protected the other locks from surges of water. Built in 1891, it has limestone abutments, and mitre gates built of squared wooden timbers. * Each of the five locks in the canal is about 144 long by 36 feet wide, with walls of limestone block and timber gates. The gates are opened and closed by a hand-crank, gear, and spar. The locks are flooded by gear-operated butterfly valves at the upstream end and emptied by butterfly valves at the downstream end. Each lock lifts a boat about 10 feet, can fill in about four minutes, and empties in about three minutes. Lock 1 was rebuilt in 1882, lock 2 in 1903, locks 3 and 4 in 1876-78. Lock 5 is similar to the others except that its walls are rubblestone and wooden planking instead of cut limestone blocks - still the original construction method from the 1850s, though it has been maintained since. Each lock is circled by a pipe railing, and has a lock shack built in 1917. * The Lockkeeper's House near lock 1 is a 1.5-story gabled ell structure built around 1890. Nearby is a stable built around 1900 and a boathouse. * The railroad swing bridge below lock 2 is not part of the navigation system, but is included in the NRHP nomination. It was built in 1903 with a Warren truss design and an electric motor. Decline The waterway across Wisconsin never carried much commerce. The upper Fox was slow and meandering - even the dredges got stuck there. The Wisconsin River below Portage was tricky to navigate because of shifting sandbars. Already in the 1850s wagon roads were improving, and new railroads were being built across the state. And they could run year-round, regardless of water levels. Traffic on the rivers dwindled until the Corps of Engineers recommended in 1982 that the Fox River lock system be dismantled. After years of discussion, in 2004 the Corps transferred the locks to the state. Restoration began, and the Kaukauna locks are planned to reopen in 2017.

It originally aired on Showtime on November 6, 2011. Carrie comes up with a way to get Brody to take a polygraph test. The tension between Brody and Mike finally comes to a head. Plot Carrie (Claire Danes) arrives at Langley, seemingly rejuvenated. Everyone there is in disbelief that Afsal Hamid was able to kill himself. Carrie proposes that a polygraph test be administered to everyone who came into contact with Hamid. Carrie is excited because Brody (Damian Lewis) will be on the list; she is confident he will not be able to pass the polygraph. The testing process begins that day. Carrie is the first to take the polygraph. She passes every question, except for when she is asked if she has taken illegal drugs while employed by the CIA. Meanwhile, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) interviews a neighbor at the abandoned house that Raqim Faisel (Omid Abtahi) had bought, and he learns that Raqim was living with a woman there. Raqim and Aileen (Marin Ireland), now on the run, arrive at a safehouse. They are about to enter but Aileen spots a booby trap on the door. Now under threat from al- Qaeda as well as the authorities, Raqim thinks they should turn themselves in, but Aileen refuses. At Langley, they have managed to identify Aileen Morgan as Raqim's girlfriend. They check into Aileen's background, and it is discovered she lived in Saudi Arabia for five years as a child. Saul is called on to take the polygraph. He is agitated from the beginning, and the polygraph indicates he is lying when he denies giving the razor blade to Hamid. He stands up and aborts the test, saying he is too busy and will finish it tomorrow. A memorial service is held for Tom Walker. Brody delivers the eulogy while fighting back memories of beating Walker to death. Afterwards, Carrie finds Brody and tells him about the polygraph test he has to take; they schedule it for the following day. At the reception, Brody and Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) are chatting with some other Marines who attended the service. One of the Marines, Wakefield (Marc Menchaca), is drunk and turns belligerent. He angrily asks Brody why he came home alive, while Walker was killed. Brody says he was lucky. Wakefield then says all the men there wanted to have sex with Jessica while Brody was gone, but only one of them did. At that point, Mike attacks Wakefield. Brody then pulls Mike off Wakefield and, immediately sensing Mike is being defensive about his affair with Brody's wife, starts punching him without hesitation, saying, \\"you were my friend!\\" After bloodying Mike, Brody gets in his car and leaves. That night, Carrie gets a call from Brody, who is at a bar and wants someone to talk to after his tumultuous day. Carrie arrives and they once again hit it off, having several rounds of drinks and enjoying getting to know each other. Both drunk, they walk out to the parking lot. Carrie admits to Brody that Hamid killed himself, and that the purpose of Brody's polygraph test will be to determine if he gave Hamid the razor blade. They start kissing, and end up having sex in Carrie's car. Raqim and Aileen are staying in a motel. Their room is suddenly sprayed with machine gun fire. Raqim is killed, while Aileen escapes. Saul takes the polygraph again and passes this time. He enters the observation room with Carrie, as Brody's test is next. Brody takes the test and easily passes on every question, including the one asking whether he gave Afsal Hamid the razor blade. Carrie is flustered, but has one more gambit - she tells the interviewer Larry (James Urbaniak) to ask Brody if he has ever been unfaithful to his wife. Brody looks right into the camera which Carrie is observing, and says \\"no.\\" The polygraph reading does not budge. Saul wraps up the test, and Brody is excused. Carrie is now in the difficult position of knowing Brody is able to beat the polygraph, but unable to reveal to Saul how she knows this. Saul tells her to accept that Brody passed the polygraph and that it is time to forget him as a suspect. Carrie goes outside. Brody drives up to her and tells her to get in his car. She does, and they drive off. Production The episode was written by consulting producer Henry Bromell, his first of two writing credits for the first season. It was directed by Brad Turner, who was a primary director on 24, which Homeland developers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa worked on. The song being rapped by the Marines at the reception at Brody's House is \\"Rabbit Run\\" by Eminem. Reception Ratings The original broadcast had 1.33 million viewers, which marked a fourth consecutive week of growth in viewership. Reviews \\"The Good Soldier\\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised the development of the relationship between Carrie and Brody. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic rated \\"The Good Soldier\\" a 4.5/5, citing Homeland's unpredictability as one of its strong suits. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised the chemistry between Danes and Lewis, saying \\"their scenes together the last few weeks have been tremendous\\".

On 7 November 1996 the crew of the Boeing 727-200 operating the flight lost control of the aircraft while avoiding a mid-air collision on approach; the aircraft crashed inverted at a very high speed, killing all 144 passengers and crew on board. Investigators determined the primary cause of the accident was an air traffic control error. (misreports registration as 5N-BBF) Accident Flight 86 was en route to Lagos airport at flight level (FL) 240 (approximately altitude). At the same time an aircraft operated by Triax was on its way from Lagos to Enugu at FL160. The Lagos Air Traffic Controller cleared the crew of Flight 86 to descend, but erroneously thought that he had earlier cleared Flight 86 to descend to and that it was below the Triax aircraft. The descent from FL240 caused Flight 86 to conflict with the Triax flight at FL160. The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) sounded an alert but when the crew took evasive action they overcompensated and it rolled too far; the pilots lost control and within sixteen seconds the aircraft was upside down and diving towards the ground at near-Mach 1 speed. The inverted aircraft disintegrated on impact near Imota (Ejirin) at 17:05 local time.  Cause  The primary cause of the accident was determined to be error on part of the air traffic controller, quote \\"The untidy traffic separation by the radar controller which resulted from the vectoring of ADK 086 towards the track of the opposite traffic TIX 185.\\" The pilot was also found to be at fault for proceeding on a heading of 330 and the risky maneuver to avoid a collision with the Triax plane.

The album is their first since the Blue Album in 2004 and the first since they reformed in 2008. It features vocals from Zola Jesus and Lady Leshurr. Wonky debuted at number 22 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 8,001 copies in its first week. This was their highest position on the album chart since 2001. Recording Following their reformation and successful comeback shows, Orbital decided that they needed to write new material to include in their live shows. The album was recorded mostly using vintage and analogue synthesizers, primarily the Macbeth M5, Moog Voyager, and Jomox SunSyn as well as a Roland 303, 808, 909, and SH-02, between January and November 2011 in Brighton where the Hartnoll brothers both lived. The recording of the album was documented with video diaries, where the brothers shared commentary and works and progress. The band plotted out the album's sound and structure very early on with a visual map drawn on old wallpaper, kept on their studio wall and annotated with sticky notes. Producer Flood was brought in to help with the mixing. The vocal samples from \\"One Big Moment\\" were favorites collected over the course of their career. Paul started searching for a vocalist for \\"New France\\" later in the recording process, and while using Spotify discovered Zola Jesus, whom he \\"instantly fell in love with.\\" Her vocals were recorded in London while on tour in Europe. \\"Wonky\\" began as an \\"off-the-map\\" instrumental demo recorded for their 2011 Glastonbury DJ set at the Arcadia stage, before the idea to feature a \\"Missy Elliot-type\\" rapper occurred. It was nicknamed \\"Cats\\" in the studio due to its unintentional cat-like sounds. \\"Distractions\\" was inspired by the dub sounds of Adrian Sherwood and samples the voice of folk singer Emily Portman. \\"Beelzedub\\" is a remix of their early 1990 song \\"Satan\\" which evolved from changes made to the track over years of live performances, and was originally not intended for the album until producer Flood \\"begged\\" the duo to include it. Similarly, \\"Stringy Acid\\" originated from an unfinished demo created in late 1989, which was re- discovered on an old cassette tape and re-worked for the album. Orbital described the title of \\"Where Is It Going?\\" as an optimistic question about the future of the band. The album's title is, according to Paul Hartnoll, a reference to the fact that \\"we've never really fitted in\\". Promotion The track \\"Never\\" was released as a free download from the official Orbital site in January 2012. An edited version of \\"New France\\" was released as the first single on 27 February 2012 as a single track download,https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/new-france-feat.-zola- jesus/id503910048 with a remix EP released on 19 March 2012 featuring remixes from L-Vis 1990, Tom Middleton and The Hydraulic Dogs. The title track was released as the second single on 21 April 2012. \\"Where Is It Going?\\" was released as the third single on 27 August. Release Wonky was released as a CD album, a double CD album, a vinyl LP and as a digital download. The double CD album includes a second disc featuring five tracks recorded live in Australia in 2011. The iTunes Deluxe version also features two music videos for \\"Never\\" and \\"Straight Sun\\". Track listing Tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 written by Paul Hartnoll.

The aggregated score from 20 reviews on Metacritic gave it an average of 74/100. Many critics felt that Wonky was Orbital's best album in some time. Drowned in Sound wrote \\"Well here's something I never thought I'd ever write again: the new Orbital album is great\\", and went on to say that Wonky was \\"the best record Orbital have made in the past 15 years and up there with their very best\\". Mojo said \\"the best Orbital album since 1994's Snivilisation? Certainly\\". Steve Price (writing on the Orbital website Loopz) reviewed the album on 4 February 2012 and said \\"...after many weeks of listening, I feel this is probably one of the best Orbital albums since In Sides\\". MusicOMH stated \\"as it turns out, this is not a duo in the last throes of their musical lives ‚Äì rather it marks the beginning of a new and potentially very exciting chapter for the Hartnoll brothers\\". The NME said \\"Wonky has reconnected them with the lush spirit of their first and second albums\\". Allmusic said \\"it feels a touch forced, but what remains clear is that the Hartnolls still have the ability to make magic more than 20 years after their debut\\". BBC Music said \\"nobody would expect an eighth album by a band 20-plus years into its career to sound this fantastic, but time away has obviously helped re-energise the brothers into crafting this triumphantly grand return\\". Pitchfork said \\"it's not perfect, but it is an unexpectedly great comeback album\\". Mary Chang of This is Fake DIY suggested Wonky was \\"further proof that Orbital aren‚Äôt content to stand still and rest on the laurels that have made them ones to watch at festivals.\\" Martyn Cooling of Faux Magazine said \\"despite the terrible name and the altogether confusingly placeless lead single (of the same name), the album is a complex yet completely solid piece of work that will remind listeners of the early 1990s techno-film-score Orbital and their self titled first albums, rather than the latter day The Altogether & Blue Album era\\". Tony Vilgotsky of Mir Fantastiki gave the album 9 points of 10, having said that this is a \\"bizarre and strange record from the electronic music's patriarchs, one of the most notable releases of the year\\".Tony Vilgotsky.

Both nations are Arab League members and engage in close development cooperation. Somalia also has an embassy in Abu Dhabi, and the UAE maintains an embassy in Mogadishu. Overview Relations between the territories of present-day Somalia and the United Arab Emirates stretch back to antiquity. The 1st century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, among other documents, reports early commercial exchanges between traders inhabiting city-states on the northern Somalia littoral with Himyarite and Sabaean merchants, who controlled much of the Arabian peninsula. During the Middle Ages and early modern period, the various Somali Sultanates also maintained close relations with other kingdoms across the Red Sea. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Somalia Abdirahman Duale Beyle meeting with the UAE Ambassador to Somalia Mohamed Al-Osmani in Mogadishu. After the start of the civil war in Somalia in 1991, the UAE maintained diplomatic relations with the Somali Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government, and supported their government initiatives. Somali President hails UAE President's humanitarian efforts The UAE has also officially supported the Puntland Maritime Police Force since the military body's formation in 2010. The subsequent establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia in August 2012 was welcomed by the Emirati authorities, who re-affirmed the UAE's continued support for Somalia's government, its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In May 2019, a U.S. senator blamed the UAE for fostering conflict in Somalia, in particularly by nurturing animosity between Somalia's regional states (such as Jubaland, Puntland) and the central government, particularly by signing separate economic deals, such as coastal ports.https://allafrica.com/stories/201905090605.html DP World operates the Port of Berbera in Somaliland. The UAE has announced intentions to open a military base in Somaliland. Development cooperation In March 2014, Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed began an official three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates to discuss strengthening bilateral cooperation between the two nations. During talks with UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Presidential affairs Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Emirati authorities emphasized their commitment to the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process in Somalia. They also pledged to assist in capacity building and the rehabilitation of government institutions. In January 2015, new Prime Minister of Somalia Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke met with the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to Somalia Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi at his Mogadishu office. The officials touched on various matters of bilateral interest, including military operations, governmental re- institutionalization, maritime security, and the local reconstruction process. Sharmarke noted the longstanding and close relationship between the territories of Somalia and the UAE. Ambassador Al Hammadi in turn pledged that the Emirati authorities would support the ongoing developmental activities in Somalia. In March 2015, Foreign Affairs Minister of Somalia Abdisalam Omer met with th Foreign Affairs Minister of the United Arab Emirates Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi. The two leaders touched on various bilateral matters, including strengthening collaboration and cooperation in the security sector, among other areas. They also evaluated ongoing mutual projects and discussed the political situation in Somalia. Omer in turn commended the Emirati government for its various development initiatives in Somalia, and applauded the UAE's commitment to the reconstruction process therein. Military cooperation The United Arab Emirates trained hundreds of Somali troops since 2014. The UAE had been paying the salaries of several hundred Somali soldiers, and trained an anti-piracy force in Puntland state of Somalia. The training mission ended after Somali police seized money in three unmarked bags on a Royal Jet plane at the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, according to the Somali interior ministry. The Somali government announced on Wednesday April 11, 2018, that it will take over paying and training the soldiers in the programme, Defence Minister Mohamed Mursal Abdirahman told Somalia's state news agency Sonna. \\"Somalia will fully take over [its troops] trained by the UAE... Those forces will be added to the various battalions of the Somalia National Army,\\" Abdirahman said, adding the soldiers would be integrated into other units on Thursday. Agreements In late March 2013, Foreign Minister of Somalia Fowziya Yusuf Haji Adan and her Emirati counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan signed a Memorandum of Understanding on bilateral cooperation. The agreement re-establishes formal diplomatic ties between Somalia and the UAE, and also focuses on the political, security, economic, investment and development sectors. Additionally, the Emirati government announced that it would re-open its embassy in Mogadishu. In November 2014, Somalia and the United Arab Emirates signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance military cooperation. Diplomatic missions The Somali Federal Government maintains an embassy in Abu Dhabi. The diplomatic mission is led by Ambassador AbdulKadir Sheikhey Al- Hatimi. The United Arab Emirates' embassy in Mogadishu is headed by Ambassador Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi.

Annu Rev Med 63:1‚Äì22 Early life He was born in San Francisco and moved to New York, where he spent his remaining childhood years. He studied first at Syracuse University and then earned a law degree from New York University. Initially, he worked as a lawyer but became interested in psychology. In 1939 he began a PhD at Columbia University where his supervisor was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Sigmund Freud. After graduation he became one of the first non- physicians in the United States to practice as a psychoanalyst. Wexler married Leonore Sabin (1913 ‚Äì May 14, 1978) another Columbia University graduate (Master's in Zoology, 1936). They met in the mid 1930s while he was working as a lawyer and she as a teacher. Together they had two daughters ‚Äì Nancy and Alice. Wexler served in the US Navy during the Second World War. In 1946 he worked at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. He became known for his success in treating schizophrenics. Involvement with Huntington's disease In 1950 his wife's three brothers (Paul, Seymour and Jesse) were diagnosed with Huntington's disease. His wife's father Abraham Sabin (1879‚Äì1926) had earlier died of this disease. She believed on the basis of what was known about this disease at the time when her father had died that this disease only affected men. It is curious that the textbook she consulted stated that only men suffered from this disease given that the original description by George Huntington in 1872 described it in a mother and daughter. Wexler moved to Los Angeles in 1951 to establish a more lucrative private practice so that he could support them. His practice became popular with writers, artists and Hollywood stars. His patients included the director Blake Edwards, the actors Jennifer Jones and Dudley Moore, the comedian Carol Burnett and the architect Frank Gehry.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1988-09-26-vw-1894-story.html He also collaborated on the scripts of films The Man who Loved Women and That's Life!. He was an advocate of group therapy sessions. In the 1950s his wife, normally an outgoing person, developed depression and once attempted suicide. Neither Wexler nor his wife realized at this time that these symptoms may occur in Huntington's disease. They divorced in 1962. In 1967, after getting out of her car at 9 a.m. while on jury duty, Leonore Wexler was stopped by a policeman who thought she had been drinking. She was referred to a neurologist who in 1968 diagnosed Huntington's disease. She got in touch with her ex-husband, with whom she was still in contact, and told him of the diagnosis. In response to this news, he later that year created an organization that became known as the Hereditary Disease Foundation. He enlisted the help of Marjorie Guthrie, the widow of the musician Woody Guthrie, who had also died of this disease. She had earlier set up an organization in California, the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease which eventually became the Huntington's Disease Society of America, to raise funds for the investigation of this disease. With the help of his daughters Wexler enlisted a number of scientists including the Nobel laureate James Watson. Salaries were low (US$1,000 per annum plus expenses), but he managed to attract workers by organizing parties with Hollywood stars, including many of his patients. In 1972 Wexler became aware of a village on the edge of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela with an extremely high incidence of Huntington's disease. He became aware of this village when a Venezuelan physician and biochemist at the University of Zulia, Americo Negrette, showed a film at a medical conference about this community, where the condition was known as 'El mal'. Negrette had become aware of this condition in the area in 1955. In 1979, Wexler's daughter Nancy set up a research project there to study its transmission and to collect DNA from those with the disease and from those who had escaped it. Her work there earned her the nickname 'La Catira' (the Blonde) among the villagers. This project is still ongoing. The origin of the disease was eventually traced back to a single woman, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n, who had lived in this area about 200 years before and whose roughly 18,000 descendants were primarily located in two villages in Venezuela, Barranquitas and Lagunetas. Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n's father seems likely to have been an unknown European sailor who also had Huntington's disease. The materials she collected were sent to a geneticist, James F. Gusella, at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The gene responsible was finally located at the tip of the short arm of chromosome 4 in 1983. It was located with the aid of a marker designated G8, which incidentally was the first marker tested. This event earned Gusella the nickname 'Lucky Jim' among his colleagues. The gene itself was finally located in 1993 The consortium involved in its discovery included fifty eight scientists in six groups spanning the Atlantic. Since this discovery, gene work has continued in the attempt to discover a treatment for this disease. Wexler was once asked why he became involved in the search of this gene. 'I became an activist because I was terribly selfish' he said. 'I was scared to death that one of my daughters would get it too.' He featured in Sydney Pollack's documentary Sketches of Frank Gehry. He died at home of respiratory failure aged 98.

He was Peshwa Baji Rao II's favorite. After the death of Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao, there was debates for the position of Peshwa among the Maratha Empire. Balaji Kunjar performed a successful role to convey most friendly declaration and assurance between Baji Rao II and Nana Phadanvis, to appoint Baji Rao II as peshwa of Maratha Empire. Peshwa Baji Rao II and Nana Phadanvis awarded inam (Jagir) to him in 14 villages near Purandhar fort, for his role. He performed successful role in administration of maratha empire and as affairs minister or diplomat (vakil) for Peshwa Baji Rao II. He along with his son Pandoji Kunjar and Narayan, enjoyed the position as Sur-Patil (‡§∏‡§∞-‡§™‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§≤) at Pune Punch Mahals during the era of Peshawa Baji Rao II. He along with his family has long enjoyed the privileges of sar-patil of 360 villages and towns in the Subha of Poona.  Career  Rise of Balaji Kunjar (Kunjir) (from A.D. 1795-1796) In the service of Nana Purandare, there was a shiledar, the natural son of the Patil of the village \\"Waghapur\\", near Purandhar Fort. Nana Purandare appointed him to collect the revenue of \\"Khandesh\\", who had contrived to attract the notice of Baji Rao II, when he was taken from confinement at Shivneri, and who was afterwards permitted by Nana Purandare to enter in the service of Peshwa Baji Rao II. Balaji Kunjar, for such was the name of the shiledar, perceiving the situation of the affairs, although he had little opportunity of consulting his master, visited Nana Phadanvis at Mahad, and conveyed the most friendly declaration and assurances on the part of Baji Rao II, begging of Nana to exert himself in their mutual behalf. Vitthojirao Holkar declared that he was working for Amrutrao, who was more capable of being the Peshwa than Bajirao (II). Bajirao (II) sent Balaji Kunjir and Bapu Gokhale to arrest Vitthojirao Holkar, and in April, 1801, Vitthojirao was arrested and taken to Pune. He was sentenced to death under the feet of an elephant. His wife and son Harirao were imprisoned. The well-wishers of the Maratha Confederacy warned the Peshwa not to take such a drastic step, as it would lead to the collapse of the Maratha Confederacy; but Bajirao (II) Peshwa ignored it. When Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar learned this, he vowed to take revenge. In May 1802, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar marched towards Pune to solve the disputes. He conquered Sendhwa, Chalisgaon, Dhulia, Malegaon, Parol, Ner, Ahmednagar, Rahuri, Nasik, Sinner, Dungargaon, Jamgaon, Pharabagh, Gardond, Pandharpur, Kurkumb, Narayangaon, Baramati, Purandhar, Saswad, Moreshwar, Thalner, and Jejuri. On Sunday, 25 October 1802, on the festival of Diwali, Yashwantrao Holkar defeated the combined armies of Scindia and Peshwa at Hadapsar, near Pune. The battles took place at Ghorpadi, Banwadi and Hadapsar. Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had ordered his army not to attack first and wait until 25 cannonballs were fired from other side; when the 25 cannonballs were fired, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar ordered his army to attack. As soon as he had won the war, he ordered his army not to harm the civilians of Pune. The Peshwa, when he learned that he was defeated, fled from Pune via Parvati, Wadgaon to Sinhgad. Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar asked the Peshwa to return to Pune. If Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had decided to arrest the Peshwa, he could have done so; but instead he sent food to the Peshwa so that he did not have to suffer. On 27 October 1802, Peshwa Bajirao (II), along with Chimnaji, Baloji Kunjir and with some soldiers of Scindia, went to Raigad and spent one month in Virwadi. He then went to Suwarnadurgh, and on 1 December 1802, went to Bassein via a ship named Harkuyan. The British offered him enticements to sign the Subsidiary Treaty in return for the throne. After deliberating for over a month, and after threats that his brother would otherwise be recognized as Peshwa, Bajirao (II) signed the treaty, surrendering his residual sovereignty and allowing the English to put him on the throne at Poona. This Treaty of Bassein was signed on 31 December 1802. After signing the treaty with the British, Baji Rao II concluded that he was Peshwa only in name. Then he tried to raise an army in a hidden way to fight against British. He gave support and funds to Baloji Kunjir to raise army. Balaji Kunjir, with the help of Trimbakji, tried to train forces at the Bay of Nira River. The British became suspicious about these movements, and sent their forces to observe the condition at Nira. The British gave warnings to Peshwa to stop his activity against the British. Balaji Kunjar went Gwalior to Shindia's Durbar as an agent of Peshwa Baji Rao II, for many years. Balaji Kunjar seems to have been an honest man and had the welfare of the Maratha Empire at heart. He did not, and would not, play into the hands of the British, who were then giving effect to the maxims laid down by Machiavelli and corrupting the Peshwa's ministers. He also tried to mediate between Scindia and Holkar, to build up a united front among the Maratha chiefs. Balaji Kunjar fought against the British after the destruction of the Maratha Empire, with Pindaris and Trimbkaji Dengle. He died at Pundharpur in 1816.

The album spawned the hits \\"Rain\\" (a Boy Mondragon original), \\"Boy (I Love You)\\" (a Cherie Gil original) and the lead single, \\"Kapag Tumibok Ang Puso\\", which was Cruz's debut single and breakthrough hit. The album was re-issued in 1991 and included a bonus track entitled \\"Ba't Di Mo Sabihin\\", a duet with Filipino balladeer and former Smokey Mountain member Tony Lambino. Background After Cruz won Bulilit Bagong Kampeon in 1987, she signed a recording contract with Viva Records, becoming the youngest artist on the label. Initially conceptualized as a cover album, Cruz recorded tracks such as \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story and \\"Rain\\", a Boy Mondragon original. However, Vic del Rosario, Cruz' executive producer, secured a demo from Aaron Paul, which was \\"Kapag Tumibok ang Puso\\", and asked Cruz to sing it. Satisfied with the results, Del Rosario enlisted Snaffu Rigor, who wrote Cherie Gil's classic teenybopper hit \\"Boy (I Love You)\\" to write more bubblegum pop songs for the album. Cruz ended up recording \\"Boy (I Love You)\\" and three more songs penned by Rigor. Cruz recorded all the songs at the age of twelve, making her the youngest artist from Viva Records to ever record a full studio album. In 1990, Donna was generally well received by the public and earned a double platinum certification, making her the youngest artist to ever reach platinum in the Philippines.

In addition to the two Derby winners, the Canopus mare also produced Fanchon, the dam of the 1000 Guineas winner Cara. Spaniel's sire, Whalebone won the 1810 Derby and thirteen other races before becoming a successful and important stallion. He was British Champion sire in 1826 and 1827 and through his son Sir Hercules, is the male-line ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds. Spaniel was not an impressive young horse, being small and weak and was sold by Egremont, either as a foal or as a yearling to Viscount Lowther for 150 guineas (one source claims the price was 500 guineas). According to one version of the story, the deal was done over the dinner table. Lowther had the colt trained by Joe Rogers. Racing career 1830: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, Spaniel ran four times without success, with all of his runs being at Newmarket. He began his racing career on 13 May in a Sweepstakes over six furlongs. He started at odds of 4/1 and finished second of the seven runners to a colt named Zany. Two months later he finished behind Zany again, on this occasion when finishing unplaced in the July Stakes. He returned in October when he finished unplaced (\\"in the ruck\\") in a ¬£50 race won by an unnamed colt by Emilus. His final start of the year came in November when he ran in the Nursery Stakes, a handicap race for two-year-olds over one mile. He started 5/4 favourite under a weight of 110 pounds, but finished a remote third behind Naiad. The American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine commented that a less patient trainer than Joe Rogers would not have persevered with what they described as a \\"little, scratching thing.\\" 1831: three-year-old season John E. Ferneley. Spaniel recorded his first win on his three-year-old debut on 4 April. Spaniel was still technically a two-year-old in this race, as horses at this time had their official \\"birthdays\\" on 1 May: the change to 1 January came in 1834. He carried 94 pounds in a one-mile handicap over the Abingdon Mile course at Newmarket and won easily from thirteen opponents. After this win Spaniel appeared in the betting lists for the Epsom Derby, but was not considered one of the leading contenders. On 17 May, two days before the Derby he started at odds of 1/4 in the Shirley Stakes on the first day of the Epsom meeting. Although he won very easily from three opponents he did not appear to impress the bookmakers, who moved his odds for the Derby from 30/1 out to 50/1. Confidence in Spaniel faded to such an extent that both his trainer Joe Rogers and his jockey Will Wheatley attempted to cancel the bets they had placed on him. Wheatley succeeded in cancelling a ¬£25 bet which would have won him ¬£1,000. On 19 May Spaniel started at odds of 50/1 for the Derby in a field of twenty-three runners. The favourite was Riddlesworth, who had won the 2000 Guineas. Despite the puzzling fact that his owner Lord Jersey \\"declared to win\\" with his other runner, an outsider named Blunder, Riddlesworth was the subject of extremely heavy wagering and started at odds of 4/6, making him one of the shortest priced favourites in the history of the race up to that time. Spaniel, despite being the smallest horse in the race, looked very impressive in the paddock before the race and when cantering to the start he moved exceptionally well \\"as though... he trod on air\\", despite the extremely hard ground. After several false starts and delays the race got under way, and after a fast start, almost all the jockeys restrained their mounts, and the pace was extremely slow. The gallop was so gentle that jockeys could be seen \\"gossiping to each other\\" and Wheatley later commented that Spaniel could have sustained such a pace \\"right away to London\\". The lack of a testing gallop meant that almost all of the runners were still in contention turning into the straight and the race devolved into a sprint over the last quarter mile. Spaniel produced the best acceleration to take the lead in the closing stages and win quite easily from Riddlesworth, who appeared to be disadvantaged by the exaggerated waiting tactics employed by his jockey, George Edwards. The winner's name and odds caused the New Sporting Magazine to comment that the heavy gamblers had been bitten by the \\"little dog\\" who had \\"run like mad\\". Spaniel did not run again for more than four months before starting favourite for the Trial Stakes at Newmarket on 3 October. He led for much of the way but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished second to the filly Camarine. On his final start of the year he finished unplaced behind Lucetta in the Audley End Stakes over one and three quarter miles on 4 November. 1832: four-year-old season Spaniel began his four-year-old season with three defeats. He was unplaced in the Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket on 25 April, and unplaced again in a Plate race at Ascot on 20 June. Eight days later he ran in the Gold Cup at Hampton racecourse. This race was run in heats. This was an old-fashioned form of racing in which the horses ran twice over the same course. If a horse won both heats it took the prize: otherwise the two heat- winners had a deciding run-off. Spaniel finished second in both heats to a three-year-old named Sluggard. Spaniel was then put up for sale and bought by a Mr Meyrick. He was sent to race in Wales where he faced less demanding opposition and won five of his remaining six races in 1832. On 7 August he won a ¬£50 Plate in heats at Brecon and on 12 September he was sent to Carmarthen where he won the Tradesman's Plate in heats and the Dynevor Stakes later the same day. On 26 September at Brecon he ran six times (at least) in one day as he contested three separate \\"heat\\" races. He was beaten in the Ladies' Plate, but then won the Members' Plate and ended the day by winning a handicap race. 1833: five-year-old season On his first start as a five-year-old, Spaniel broke down injured in the first heat of the Canterbury Stakes on 31 August. He did not recover from the injury, and died later in the year. Pedigree * Spaniel was inbred 4x4 to Woodpecker, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. His dam, the Canopus mare was inbred 3x3x4 to this horse.

The rebellion followed the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" in England of 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William III and Mary II replace the English, Catholic monarch King James II. The Lords Baltimore lost control of their proprietary colony, and for the next 25 years, Maryland would be ruled directly by the British Crown. The Protestant Revolution also saw the effective end of Maryland's early experiments with religious toleration, as Catholicism was outlawed and Roman Catholics forbidden from holding public office. Religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until after the American Revolution. Events leading to the Protestant Revolution of 1689 The Maryland Toleration Act of 1649 allowed Catholics freedom of worship for 40 years Maryland had long practiced an uneasy form of religious tolerance among different groups of Christians. In 1649, Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians. Passed on September 21, 1649, by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The Calvert family, who had founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies. Economic problems Charles Calvert's rule as governor was aggravated by growing economic problems. From the 1660s onwards, the price of tobacco, the staple crop of Maryland and its chief source of export income, began a long slide, causing economic hardship especially among the poor. In 1666, neighbouring Virginia proposed a \\"stint\\" on tobacco growing ‚Äì a one-year moratorium that would lower supply and so drive up prices. Calvert initially agreed to this plan, but came to realize that the burden of the stint would fall chiefly upon his poorest subjects, who comprised \\"the generality of the province\\". Eventually, he vetoed the bill, much to the disgust of the Virginians, though in the end Nature provided a stint of her own in the form of a hurricane which devastated the 1667 tobacco crop. Religion problems Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, painted by John Closterman. By the time Charles Calvert became governor, the population of the province had gradually shifted, due to Puritan immigration, becoming, in time, an overwhelmingly Protestant British colony. Political power, however, tended to remain concentrated in the hands of the largely Roman Catholic elite. In spite of this demographic shift away from Catholicism, Calvert attempted to preserve Maryland's Catholic identity. From 1669‚Äì1689, of 27 men who sat on the Governor's Council, just eight were Protestant. Most councillors were Catholics, and many were related by blood or marriage to the Calverts, enjoying political patronage and often lucrative offices such as commands in the militia or sinecures in the Land Office.Brugger, p. 38. In response, Maryland Protestants quickly organized into anti-Catholic militias, known as \\"associators\\". Armed conflict Much conflict between Calvert and his subjects turned on the question of how far English law should be applied in Maryland and to what degree the proprietary government might exercise its own prerogative outside of the law. Delegates to the assembly wished to establish the \\"full force and power\\" of the law, but Calvert, ever protective of his prerogative, insisted that only he and his councillors might decide where and when English law should apply. Such uncertainty could and did permit the charge of arbitrary government. Calvert acted in various ways to restrain the influence of the Protestant majority. In 1670, he restricted suffrage to men who owned or more or held property worth more than 40 pounds.Brugger, p. 35. He also restricted election to Maryland's House of Delegates to those who owned at least of land. In 1676, he directed the voters to return half as many delegates to the assembly, two instead of four. Measures like these might make the assembly easier to manage, but they tended to strain relations between Calvert and his subjects. Religious conflicts In 1675, the elder Lord Baltimore died, and Charles Calvert, now 38 years old, returned to London in order to be elevated to his barony. His political enemies took the opportunity of his absence to launch a scathing attack on the proprietorial government, publishing a pamphlet in 1676 titled A Complaint from Heaven with a Hue and Crye ... out of Maryland and Virginia, listing numerous grievances and in particular complaining of the lack of an established church. Neither was the Church of England happy with Maryland's experiment in religious tolerance. The Anglican minister John Yeo wrote scathingly to the Archbishop of Canterbury, complaining that Maryland was \\"in a deplorable condition\\" and had become \\"a sodom of uncleanliness and a pesthouse of iniquity\\". This was taken sufficiently seriously in London that the Privy Council directed Calvert to respond to the complaints made against him. Calvert's response to these challenges was defiant. He hanged two of the would-be rebels and moved to re- assert Maryland's religious diversity. His written response illustrates the difficulties facing his administration; Calvert wrote that Maryland settlers were \\"Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, and Quakers, those of the Church of England as well as the Romish being the fewest ...It would be a most difficult task to draw such persons to consent unto a Law which shall compel them to maintaine ministers of a contrary perswasion to themselves\\". Protestant conspiracies Benedict Calvert, second son of Charles Calvert, who would later become the 4th Baron Baltimore In 1679, Charles and Jane celebrated a second son, Benedict. But two years later, in 1681, Lord Baltimore once again faced rebellion, led by a former governor of the province Josias Fendall (1657‚Äì1660) and John Coode, who would later lead the successful rebellion of 1689. Fendall was tried, convicted, fined forty thousand pounds of tobacco and exiled, but his co-conspirator Coode successfully escaped retribution.Brugger, p. 36. By this time, the political fabric of the province was starting to tear. The governor of Virginia reported that \\"Maryland is now in torment ... and in great danger of falling in pieces\\".Brugger, p. 37. Relations between the governing council and the assembly grew increasingly strained. Underlying much of the rancour was the continued slide in the price of tobacco, which by the 1680s had fallen 50% in 30 years. In 1681 Baltimore also faced personal tragedy; his eldest son and heir, Cecil, died leaving his second son Benedict as the heir presumptive to the Calvert inheritance. Border conflict with Pennsylvania Adding to his difficulties, Lord Baltimore found himself embroiled in a serious conflict over land boundaries with William Penn, engaging in a dispute over the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania. In 1681, King Charles II had granted Penn a substantial but rather vague proprietorship to the north of Maryland. Penn, however, began building his capital city south of the 40th Parallel, in Maryland territory. Penn and Calvert met twice to negotiate a settlement, but were unable to reach agreement. Lord Baltimore's departure for England In 1684, Baltimore travelled to England,Hoffman, p. 87. both to defend himself in the dispute with Penn as well as to answer charges that he favoured Catholics in the colony. He would never return to Maryland. Calvert left the province in the care of his nephew George Talbot, whom he made acting governor, placing him at the head of the Governor's Council. Unfortunately Talbot proved to be a poor choice, stabbing to death a Royal customs official on board his ship in the Patuxent River, and thereby ensuring that his uncle suffered immediate difficulties on his return to London. Calvert's replacement for Talbot was another Roman Catholic, William Joseph, who would also prove controversial. In November 1688, Joseph set about offending local opinion by lecturing his Maryland subjects on morality, adultery and the divine right of kings, lambasting the colony as \\"a land full of adulterers\\".  The Glorious Revolution and English Bill of Rights  In England, events now began to move decisively against the Calverts and their political interests. In 1688, the country underwent what would later become known as the Glorious Revolution, during which the Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant monarchs King William and Mary II of England were installed on the throne. This triumph of the Protestant faction would cause Calvert considerable political difficulties. Sensibly, Calvert moved quickly to support the new regime, sending a messenger to Maryland to proclaim the new King and Queen. Unfortunately for Lord Baltimore, the messenger died during the journey, and a second envoy ‚Äì if one was ever sent, Calvert would later claim that it was ‚Äì never arrived.Brugger, p. 39. While the other colonies in quick succession proclaimed the new sovereigns, Maryland hesitated. The delay was fatal to Baltimore's charter, and in 1691 Maryland became a royal province. Baltimore, however, was still permitted to receive the revenues in the form of quitrents and excises from his sometime colony. Maryland remained a royal colony till 1715, when it passed back into the hands of the Calverts. 1689 Protestant Revolution in Province of Maryland Henry Darnall, Deputy Governor of Maryland, was overthrown in 1689 Meanwhile, Maryland Puritans, by now a substantial majority in the colony, feeding on rumors from England and fearing Popish plots, began to organize rebellion against the proprietary government. Governor Joseph did not improve the situation by refusing to convene the assembly and, ominously, recalling weapons from storage, ostensibly for repair. Protestants, angry at the apparent lack of official support for the new King and Queen, and resentful of the preferment of Catholics like deputy governor and planter Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power, began to arm themselves. In the summer of 1689, an army of seven hundred Puritan citizen soldiers, led by Colonel John Coode and known as \\"Protestant Associators\\", defeated a proprietarial army, led by the Catholic planter.Roarke, p. 78. Darnall, heavily outnumbered, later wrote: \\"Wee being in this condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered.\\" After this \\"Glorious Protestant Revolution\\" in Maryland, the victorious Coode and his Puritan allies set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism; Catholics would thereafter be forced to maintain secret chapels in their home in order to celebrate the Mass. In 1704, an Act was passed \\"to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province\\", preventing Catholics from holding political office. John Coode would remain in power until the new royal governor, Nehemiah Blakiston, was appointed on July 27, 1691. Charles Calvert himself would never return to Maryland, and worse, his family's royal charter to the colony was withdrawn in 1689. Henceforth, Maryland would be administered directly by the British monarchy. Legacy The Protestant Revolution ended Maryland's experiment with religious toleration. Religious laws were backed up with harsh sanctions. In the early 18th century Marylanders who \\"should utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity\\" would find themselves \\"bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds\\" for a first offence.Drolsum, p. 356. Maryland established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718.Finkelman Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Darnall's great-grandson Charles Carroll of Carrollton, arguably the wealthiest Catholic in Maryland, signed the American Declaration of Independence. The United States Constitution would guarantee freedom of worship for all Americans for the first time.

The English colonists were able to protect some of their settlements, but a number of others were destroyed and abandoned. Historian Samuel Drake reported that, \\"Maine had nearly received her death-blow\\" as a result of the campaign.https://archive.org/stream/borderwarsnew00drakrich#page/160/mode/1up Background The border area between Acadia and New England in the early 18th century remained contested after battles between French and English colonists (and their allied Native Americans) during King William's War in the 1690s failed to resolve territorial disputes. New France defined the western border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine, ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ while the English Province of Massachusetts Bay formally claimed all of the land between the Piscataqua and St. Croix Rivers (all of present-day Maine). During the 1670s the English had established settlements between the Kennebec River and Penobscot Bay, contesting claims by the French and the local Abenaki people to the area. The French had established Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot, and there was a French settlement of long standing in Penobscot Bay near the site of modern Castine, Maine. All of these sites had been used as bases for attacks on English settlers during King William's War.Drake, p. 36 The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by natives (primarily Abenaki and Iroquois), and the Hudson River‚ÄìLake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. Although the Indian threat had receded somewhat due to reductions in the native population as a result of disease and the last war, they were still seen to pose a potent threat to outlying settlements.Drake, p. 150 Although war had broken out between France and England in 1702, the frontiers between New France and New England remained quiet until December of that year, when Governor-General Louis-Hector de Calli√®re authorized the Abenaki to resume the border war. In addition to any plunder reaped from expeditions against the English colonies, Calli√®re promised additional gifts. Calli√®re died in May 1703, and was replaced by Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, who vigorously promoted raiding activity as a means to maintain French influence with the Abenaki. ‚Ä¢ Vaudreuil gave Alexandre Leneuf de La Valli√®re de Beaubassin, a military officer whose family's seigneury at Beaubassin had been raided in 1696 by New England forces,Griffiths, pp. 117, 164-165, command of a small contingent of French forces and instructions to organize raids against English settlements. Massachusetts Bay Governor Joseph Dudley did not believe that the Abenaki would go to war. In June 1703 Boston newspapers reported that the Abenaki were two thirds \\"for peace and one Third for warr\\", and Dudley had been unable to convince them to join the conflict on the English side.Morrison, p. 157 The Abenaki chief Moxus attempted to warn Dudley of Vaudreuil's aggressive posture, but Dudley brushed off these reports.Morrison, p. 158 The campaign Beaubassin's command numbered about 500, and included a small contingent of French forces. Some of the remaining were Mi'kmaq from present- day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and there was also a party of Kennebec came from Norridgewock, which was under the direction of Father Sebastian Rale. Rigaud de Vaudreuil said later that the Abenakis were added to the expedition after Father Rale had assured him that his Indians would be \\"ready to take up the hatchet against the English whenever he [Vaudreuil] gave them the order.\\" Beaubassin divided his force into six groups. On August 10, 1703 (Old Style; August 21 New Style), they simultaneously attacked settlements at Wells, Cape Porpoise, Saco, Scarborough, Spurwink and Purpooduck (now in Cape Elizabeth), and Casco (now Portland).  Wells, Cape Porpoise, and Saco  At Wells, Beaubassin's forces killed or captured 39, while wounding many others. Another group raided Cape-Porpoise, which was a desolate community inhabited principally by unshielded fishermen. At Saco, the Wabanaki killed 11 and took 24 captive. (Saco was raided again in 1704 and 1705.)History of York County. 52-53 Dec 20 raid on Saco They overwhelmed the garrison in the fort at Winter Harbor (in present-day Biddeford near Biddeford Pool), forcing them to submit to terms of capitulation. (Winter Harbor was raided two more times in 1707 and 1710.)  Scarborough  As the Wabanaki approached the fort at Scarborough, they sent a captive with a flag of truce. The commanding officer kept the captive and vigorously resisted a long siege ‚Äî till he and his men were extremely exhausted, and on the verge of capture and he was relieved by a New England force. Resettlement of Scarborough started in 1702 when seven settlers arrived from Lynn, Massachusetts and construction began on a fort located on the western shore of Prout's Neck's Garrison's Cove. This fort was commanded by Captain John Larrabee. The Wabanaki subsequently began tunneling into the bluff to breach the fort from below. Had it not been for a two-day downpour that made the disturbed bank slough, exposing the previously hidden excavators to snipers in the fort, the French and Native Americans might have been successful in their attempts to capture the fort and the eight people inside. However, Beaubassin retreated in search of easier prey. Shortly after, on 6 October 200 Wabanaki went north of Falmouth to Black Point and killed or captured 19 settlers in the fields. Soon after the natives attacked the fort, which had a garrison of 8 men under the command of Lieutenant Wyatt. After a fierce resistance, the New Englanders retreated to a boat in the harbour. The Wabanaki then burned the fort.  Casco, Spurwink and Purpooduck  The Wabanaki did the most damage to Spurwink and Purpooduck (Cape Elizabeth). In Spurwink, principally inhabited by the Messrs. Jordans and their families, the Wabanaki killed or captured 22. At Purpooduck, where there were nine families settled at Spring Point, they killed 25 and carried away eight prisoners. The garrison of 36 men at Casco (Falmouth) was commanded by Major John March (and John Gyles was present). The fort was the \\"most considerable\\" fort on the eastern coast. On August 10, 1703, under the leadership of Moxus, Wanongonet and Escumbuit, the Wabanaki appeared unarmed and sent him a message under a flag of truce; pretending they had some important matter to communicate. Apprehending no immediate danger, he proceeded with a guard of only two or three men. The Wabanaki ambushed March and shot one of his attendants. A garrison of 10 men under Sargeant Hook rescued March and the others. The Wabanaki killed two of March's companions, Phippenny and Kent, in the altercation. The Wabanaki withdrew and skulked around the peninsula for a week, setting fire to the houses. The rest of the Wabanaki battalions, arrived at Casco in 200 canoes to continue the destruction of the village. They first took a sloop, two shallops and considerable plunder ; and encouraged by success, they attempted for two days and nights, to undermine the fort from the water side, as was done during King William's War. On 19 August Captain Cyprian Southack arrived on the Province Galley (ship) and relieved the siege. The natives continued to stroll around Casco, they boarded a store ship and killed the captain and three others, while wounding two others. On 26 September, Governor Dudley ordered 360 men to march toward Pigwacket, one of the main native villages, located at present-day Fryeburg, Maine. Leading 300 New Englanders, Major March chased the Wabanaki back to Pigwacket. March killed 6 and captured 6. These were the first New England reprisals of the war.  York  At the same time, under the leadership of Chief Sampson a group of Wabanaki went south of Falmouth to York and Berwick. At York, they killed the seven members of the Arthur Bragdon family as well as taking a widow and her daughter into captivity. (The following spring of 1704, after the Raid on Deerfield in February, the Wabanaki again attacked and killed settlers at York. In 1712, the Wabanaki conducted another campaign against these villages and towns. They killed or captured twenty-four people in three raids three villages, one of the villages was York.)  Berwick  Another party moved on to Berwick, ambushing a group of five New Englanders, killing one, wounding another and three were taken captive. They then attacked the fort, under the command of Captain Brown. The New Englanders repulsed the attack, killing 9 and wounding 9 of the Wabanaki. In retaliation, the natives took a man and burned him alive on a stake. Aftermath In response to their losses in the Campaign, the French and natives attacked Deerfield.New York Colonial Documents. Vol. IX, p. 762 In the spring of 1704, after the Raid on Deerfield in February, the Wabanaki again attacked Wells, and York. (In 1712, the Wabanaki conducted another campaign against these villages and towns. They killed or captured twenty-four people in three raids on three villages, one of the villages was Wells.) In response to these events and the Raid on Deerfield, the governors of the northern English colonies called for action against the French colonies. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley wrote that \\"the destruction of Quebeck and Port Royal [would] put all the Navall stores into Her Majesty's hands, and forever make an end of an Indian War\\",Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 191 the frontier between Deerfield and Wells was fortified by upwards of 2,000 men,Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 190 and the bounty for Indian scalps was more than doubled, from ¬£40 to ¬£100.Melvoin, p. 229 Dudley promptly organized a retaliatory raid against Acadia. In the summer of 1704, New Englanders under the leadership of Benjamin Church raided Acadian villages at Pentagouet (present-day Castine, Maine), Passamaquoddy Bay (present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick), Grand Pr√©, Pisiquid, and Beaubassin (all in present- day Nova Scotia).Clark, p. 220 There were also reprisals by the New Englanders against Norridgewock. During the winter of 1705, 275 soldiers under the command of Colonel Hilton were sent to Norridgewock to seize Father Rale and sack the village. Father Rale escaped them, but they burned his church. John March led an expedition against the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707. The French drew off a great number of Indian families from the Penobscot, Norridgewock, Saco, and Pequaket tribes, and settled them at St. Francis, in Canada, as a protection against the Iroquois Confederacy. These were called the St. Francis Indians.Willis, p. 311 By the end of the war, natives were successful in killing more than 700 British and capturing over 250 along the Acadia/ New England border.https://archive.org/stream/exercisesofeliot00elio#page/16/mode/1up Notes Citations References *John Reid *Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Vol. 3, p. 139-141 * Papers related to the Indian Troubles in Maine 1702-04.

Design and development The RB.203 was a private venture engine built on the core of the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofan used in the SEPECAT Jaguar and the later Hawker Siddeley Hawk. The first three-spool engine, it was intended as a civilian replacement for the earlier Rolls-Royce Spey. The RB.203 Trent was a member of an Advanced Technology Engine family of engines with thrusts covering a range from the RB.203 of just under to the RB.207 of up to . The engine designs were launched at the SBAC Farnborough Airshow in September 1966. The Advanced Technology Engine RB.203 embraced the new scalable technologies such as the three-spool architecture, a high pressure annular combustor, the extensive use of composites throughout the low pressure compressor and engine casing, air- cooled turbine blading, squeeze-film bearings and a structurally integrated duct, the gearbox driven from the high pressure shaft and located in the nacelle. The Trent RB.203 design objectives were: * Lighter, more compact powerplant * Improved fuel consumption * Reduced number of parts, resulting in cheaper manufacturing costs and ease of overhaul * Use of established turbine entry temperatures * Adequate growth potential. The engine was aimed primarily at the short-haul market as a Spey replacement. Specific fuel consumption was projected to be better than the then current engines and noise reduction was also a design feature. The Trent was expected to better FAA noise proposals by a considerable margin. Advanced components, which had between 15 years and 10 million service hours, promised long life, reduced weight, reduced vibration and a reduction in manufacturing costs. The RB203 successfully ran for the first time on 18 December 1967. As the first in the family of Advanced Technology Engines the RB.203 Trent led the testing and the development of the RB.207 and the RB.211. The Trent was ordered by Fairchild Hiller to power the FH-228 short haul airliner. A key technology introduced on the RB.203 Trent was its structurally integrated nacelle, also referred to as a power plant.

History Kharagpur Junction came up in 1898‚Äì99. On one side, Bengal Nagpur Railway's Kharagpur‚ÄìCuttack line was opened on New Year's Day in 1899. On the other hand, the opening of the bridge over the Rupnarayan River at Kolaghat, on 19 April 1900, connected Howrah with Kharagpur. Kharagpur was also linked with Sini the same year. The line was ready in 1898‚Äì99. The Kharagpur‚ÄìMidnapore branch line was opened to traffic in 1901. Infrastructure After Gorakhpur, and Kollam junction in Kerala, Kharagpur has the world's third longest railway platform with a length of . Remodelling of Gorakhpur railway station was completed and the new platform inaugurated on 6 October 2013. Till then Kharagpur boasted of the longest platform in the world for many years. Kharagpur also has the Asia's largest Railway Solid State Interlocking (SSI) system. Platform nos. 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 of Kharagpur Junction are contiguous. The 24-coach Coromandel Express stops at the start of platform no. 3 and its tail extends some distance into platform no. 1. ALOO KhasaAlOOKhasa ‚Äì Kharagpur Railway Station Special is one of the famous dish found at the Kharagpur railway platform. Background It is the busiest junction station in South Eastern Railway Zone after Howrah. Hence, it is termed as Gateway to South Eastern Railway. It is one of the fifty highest railway reservation in India. It is a junction which connects Howrah to Mumbai, Chennai, Adra/Purulia and New Delhi via Tatanagar as well. It also connects Bhubaneshwar to New Delhi. Everyday approximately 275 trains pass through this station which includes freight traffic. In terms of passenger traffic it handles 176 trains on a daily basis. So, in a bid to decongest Kharagpur station and speed up locomotives, South Eastern Railway has decided to develop Hijli (close to IIT-Kharagpur) as an alternative station for Kharagpur. In future, most of the new trains coming from Balasore side and going towards Adra or Tatanagar will stop at Hijli and bypass Kharagpur. In order to increase passenger commute between Kharagpur and Hijli, new EMU services have been introduced between these two stations. The Howrah‚ÄìNagpur‚ÄìMumbai line is classified under Route A of Indian Railways which allows trains to run at maximum permissible speed of 160 km/hr. However, as a result of the automated block section between Howrah and Kharagpur, the speed is restricted to 120 km/hr. The Howrah‚ÄìKharagpur section has been identified as one of the high density Automatic Block Section routes on Indian Railways. Thus plans are to deploy TPWS (Train Protection and Warning System) on this section to mitigate the risk of Signal passed at danger (SPAD) by train drivers leading to accidents.

The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation is undertaking the construction of six rail-over-bridges in the city. In 2008, the State Highways Department came up with a proposal to create a Ring Road passing through Peelamedu Road, Kalapatti Road, Saravanampatty Road and Kurumbapalayam Road to help decongest Avanashi Road, Mettupalayam Road and Sathyamangalam Road. The 12 km road would extend from the South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) Junction in Peelamedu, going through Kalapatti Road and connect Sathyamangalam Road at Saravanampatty and then it would connect Mettuppalayam Road at Kurumbapalayam.  Neelambur‚ÄìMadukkarai  Neelambur Toll Plaza The first section of the bypass was a two-laned road with paved shoulders built by Larsen & Toubro (L&T;) from Neelambur to Madukkarai on National Highway 544 (formerly National Highway 47) which intersects Trichy Road at Chintamani Pudur near Irugur and Eachanari on Pollachi Road. Land acquisition began as early as 1974, but the project was delayed. Construction began in 1998, and was completed in twenty-two months. It was made operational in 2000, after many delays which almost forced L&T; to pull out. It was the first road privatisation project to be implemented on a build-operate-transfer model in South India. In 2010, the National Highways Authority of India gave Iragavarapu Venkata Reddy Construction Limited (IVRCL) the tender to widen and toll the road as part of a larger toll road project from Chengapalli to Walayar. The issue was taken to court and the Delhi High Court restrained the road transport ministry from withdrawing the project awarded to Larsen & Toubro. In late January 2012, it was reported that IVRCL planned to sell the project, valued at an estimated 10 billion, and Reliance Infrastructure was said to be a \\"likely frontrunner\\" to acquire it. In 2011, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) demanded that the road be widened to four lanes. The road is subject to frequent traffic delays, and most of these are caused by the road's six toll plazas; these are primarily attributed to the fact that there are only four toll collection lanes on each toll plaza, two in each direction, and much of the time only one is open in each direction. The road is also subject to fatal accidents.  Aathupalam Bridge  Aathupalam Bridge over the Noyyal The first section also included the construction of a new 32.2m bridge over the Noyyal, at Aathupalam, with a toll period of 21 years, till 2018. The toll booth was India's earliest to use International Road Dynamics iToll tolling system. In 2000, L&T; asked the Government for permission to regulate users of the bridge, and agreed to the subsidised toll rate of 50 per day per bus of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation irrespective of the number of trips made by the bus. L&T; subsequently stopped collection of toll from vehicles bearing Local Number plates. The revenue from the Toll Booth goes partly to fund for a Railway Bridge and underpass at Chettipalaym.  Sathyamangalam‚ÄìPollachi  The National Highways Authority of India has also invited feasibility studies to upgrade National Highways 948 and 83 (formerly National Highway 209) connecting Pollachi and Bannari passing through the city. In 2009, the National Highways Authority of India sanctioned funds for widening the existing highway passing through the city which included construction of a new Rail-over-bridge at Ganapathy. However, funds were withdrawn after the agency decided to execute future projects under a public‚Äìprivate partnership. Due to withdrawal of funds from the National Highways Authority of India, the Highways and Minor Ports Department of the State Government has taken up upgradation works on the two connecting roads. In 2010, during the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi announced the construction of a three- tier flyover at Gandhipuram at a cost of 1.48 billion, to be completed over a period of two years. It would start from the Central Bus Station and end at the Corporation built Omni Bus Station on Sathyamangalam Road. The project also includes a four-lane underpass from the 100 Feet road junction to Nava India junction, four-lane up connecting the City Bus Station, State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) Bus Station, Central Bus Station and the proposed Bus Station on Sathyamangalam Road at a length of 1.2 km, the flyover will cover both the junctions. The cost was later brought down to 1 billion, and the Flyover construction was to have started in January 2011. The project met with many protests by the Hindu Munnani activists who protested the demolition of four temples along Sathyamanagalam Road and Dr. Nanjappa Road. In 2012, the Member of Parliament representing Coimbatore, P. R. Natarajan, stated that the project was not practical and demanded changes in its design. In 2011, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu announced the construction of two new flyovers at Ukkadam and Athupalam to help decongest the Palakkad Road.  Mettupalayam‚ÄìSulur  The National Highways Authority of India is conducting studies for a bypass along the Mettupalayam‚ÄìSulur National Highways 81 and 181 (formerly National Highway 67). The proposed length of this road is , and is expected to cost 6.01 billion to build. The project was met with protests from farmers who claim that the project passes through fertile land and demanded re-alignment of the road. M R Sivasamy, the president of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangham, demanded that the proposed road to be rerouted to start from Neelambur, and run through Vellanaipatty, Kallipalayam, Kunnathur, Kattampatty, Kuppepalayam, Sikkarampalayam and Odanthurai to reach Mettupalayam. The project has drawn ire from the public who are opposed to paying toll and feel that the wetlands in Sulur would be destroyed. From Sulur, the width of the road is 10 metres, with one-metre hard way on either side, while 30-km of the road, covering important towns, is four-lane, and the remaining, two-lane till Karur. In 2013, the NHAI announced that it was withdrawing from the project due to lack of support from the state government. In 2014, the NHAi handed over the section back to the State Government for maintenance and upkeep. As per the update on 31 January 2015, NHAI had mentioned in their website (https://web.archive.org/web/20090804025214/http://www.nhai.org/implementation.asp, S.No-115) as this project is still under implementation in NHDP PhaseIIIA.url=http://www.nhai.org/implementation.asp and the same has been removed as per the update on 31 July 2016  Western Bypass  In 2010, an announcement was made in the State Budget to build a Western Ring Road at a cost of 2.84 billion for 26 km. The proposed road would have been from Madukarai near ACC Cement industry, starting on Palakkad Road connecting Mettupalayam Road via Perur Road, Marudamalai Road(Bharatiyar University) and Thadagam Road(kanuvai). In 2011, the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Highways and Minor Ports Department announced the construction of a long Western Bypass from Kuniamuthur to Thudiyalur. The road would help connect people going from Madukarai, and Palakkad to Marudamalai, Thadagam, Thudiyalur and Anaikatti. The proposed road would be wide with paved shoulders on both sides and would cost 1.3 billion to build. In May 2012, the Highways Department and Local Planning Authority announced that a freeze had been imposed to prevent new land approvals in the area as land acquisition for the road construction was to begin soon. Residents of Thudiyalur opposed the road as it required demolition of their homes. The following November, it was announced that the road would terminate at Narasimhanaickenpalayam instead of Thudiyalur to minimise acquisition of land. In 2012, the government finally decided to abandon the project in favour of an eastern road that connected Mettupalayam Road with Avinashi Road and the existing L&T; bypass. In 2014, the department changed the road design again. The proposal was that the road would terminate at Narasimanaickenpalayam instead of Thudiyalur. On both occasions, officials said they were changing the design to reduce private land acquisition.

Alaska was the third vessel of the US Navy to be named after what was then the territory of Alaska. She was laid down on 17 December 1941, ten days after the outbreak of war, was launched in August 1943 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, in Camden, New Jersey, and was commissioned in June 1944. She was armed with a main battery of nine guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of . Due to being commissioned late in the war, Alaska saw relatively limited service. She participated in operations off Iwo Jima and Okinawa in February-July 1945, including providing anti-aircraft defense for various carrier task forces and conducting limited shore bombardment operations. She shot down several Japanese aircraft off Okinawa, including a possible Ohka piloted missile. In July-August 1945 she participated in sweeps for Japanese shipping in the East China and Yellow Seas. After the end of the war, she assisted in the occupation of Korea and transported a contingent of US Army troops back to the United States. She was decommissioned in February 1947 and placed in reserve, where she remained until she was stricken in 1960 and sold for scrapping the following year.

The secondary battery consisted of twelve L/38 dual-purpose guns in six twin turrets. Two were placed on the centerline superfiring over the main battery turrets, fore and aft, and the remaining four turrets were placed on the corners of the superstructure. The light anti-aircraft battery consisted of 56 quad-mounted Bofors guns and 34 single-mounted Oerlikon guns. A pair of Mk 34 gun directors aided gun laying for the main battery, while two Mk 37 directors controlled the 5-inch guns and a Mk 57 director aided the 40 mm guns.Friedman, p. 483 The main armored belt was thick, while the gun turrets had thick faces. The main armored deck was thick. Service history Alaska was authorized under the Fleet Expansion Act on 19 July 1940, and ordered on 9 September.Friedman, p. 301 On 17 December 1941 she was laid down at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 15 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy Gruening (n√©e Smith) the wife of Governor Ernest Gruening of Alaska, after which fitting-out work was effected. The ship was completed by June 1944, and was commissioned into the US Navy on 17 June, under the command of Captain Peter K. Fischler. World War II Alaska on her shakedown cruise in August 1944 After her commissioning, Alaska steamed down to Hampton Roads, escorted by the destroyers and . The ship was then deployed for a shakedown cruise, first in the Chesapeake Bay and then into the Caribbean, off Trinidad. On the cruise, she was escorted by the destroyers and . After completing the cruise, Alaska returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for some minor alterations, including the installation of four Mk 57 fire control directors for her 5-inch guns. On 12 November, she left Philadelphia in the company of the destroyer- minelayer , bound for two weeks of sea trials off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 2 December, she left Cuba for the Pacific, transiting the Panama Canal two days later, and reaching San Diego on 12 December. There her gun crews trained for shore bombardment and anti-aircraft fire. On 8 January 1945, Alaska left California for Hawaii, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 13 January. There she participated in further training and was assigned to Task Group 12.2, which departed for Ulithi on 29 January. The Task Group reached Ulithi on 6 February and was merged into Task Group 58.5, part of Task Force 58, the Fast Carrier Task Force. Task Group 58.5 was assigned to provide anti-aircraft defense for the aircraft carriers; Alaska was assigned to the carriers and . The fleet sailed for Japan on 10 February to conduct air strikes against Tokyo and the surrounding airfields. The Japanese did not attack the fleet during the operation. Alaska was then transferred to Task Group 58.4 and assigned to support the assault on Iwo Jima. She served in the screen for the carriers off Iwo Jima for nineteen days, after which time she had to return to Ulithi to replenish fuel and supplies. Alaska remained with TG 58.4 for the Battle of Okinawa. She was assigned to screen the carriers and ; the fleet left Ulithi on 14 March and reached its operational area southeast of Kyushu four days later. The first air strikes on Okinawa began that day, and claimed 17 Japanese aircraft destroyed on the ground. Here, Alaska finally saw combat, as the Japanese launched a major air strike on the American fleet. Her anti- aircraft gunners destroyed a Yokosuka P1Y bomber attempting to crash into Intrepid. Shortly thereafter, Alaska was warned that American aircraft were in the vicinity. About ten minutes later, her gunners spotted an unidentified aircraft, approaching in what they thought was a threatening manner; they shot down what turned out to be a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter, though the pilot was uninjured. Later that afternoon, Alaska shot down a second Japanese bomber, a Yokosuka D4Y. Alaska underway The following day, the carrier was badly damaged by several bomb hits and a kamikaze. Alaska and her sister , two other cruisers, and several destroyers were detached to create Task Group 58.2.9 to escort the crippled Franklin back to Ulithi. On the voyage back to port, another D4Y bomber attacked Franklin, though the ships were unable to shoot it down. Gunfire from one of the 5-inch guns accidentally caused flash burns on several men standing nearby; these were the only casualties suffered by her crew during the war. Alaska then took on the role of fighter director; using her air search radar, she vectored fighters to intercept and destroy a Kawasaki Ki-45 heavy fighter. On 22 March, the ships reached Ulithi and Alaska was detached to rejoin TG 58.4. After returning to her unit, Alaska continued to screen for the aircraft carriers off Okinawa. On 27 March, she was detached to conduct a bombardment of Minamidait≈ç. She was joined by Guam, two light cruisers, and Destroyer Squadron 47. On the night of 27-28 March, she fired forty-five 12-inch shells and three hundred and fifty-two 5-inch rounds at the island. The ships rejoined TG 58.4 at a refueling point, after which they returned to Okinawa to support the landings when they began on 1 April. On the evening of 11 April, Alaska shot down one Japanese plane, assisted in the destruction of another, and claimed what might have been an Ohka piloted rocket-bomb. On 16 April, the ship shot down another three aircraft and assisted with three others. Throughout the rest of the month, her heavy anti- aircraft fire succeeded in driving off Japanese bombers. Alaska then returned to Ulithi to resupply, arriving on 14 May. She was then assigned to TG 38.4, the reorganized carrier task force. The fleet then returned to Okinawa, where Alaska continued in her anti-aircraft defense role. On 9 June, she and Guam bombarded Oki Dait≈ç. TG 38.4 then steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf for rest and maintenance; the ship remained there from 13 June until 13 July, when she was assigned to Cruiser Task Force 95 along with her sister Guam, under the command of Rear Admiral Francis S. Low.Cressman, p. 339 On 16 July, Alaska and Guam conducted a sweep into the East China and Yellow Seas to sink Japanese shipping vessels. They had only limited success, however, and returned to the fleet on 23 July. They then joined a major raid, which included three battleships and three escort carriers, into the estuary of the Yangtze River off Shanghai. Again, the operation met with limited success.Rohwer, p. 423 In the course of her service during World War II, Alaska was awarded three battle stars. Post-war Reserve fleet in Bayonne; the two large ships at right are Alaska and Guam. On 30 August, Alaska left Okinawa for Japan to participate in the 7th Fleet occupation force. She arrived in Incheon, Korea, on 8 September and supported Army operations there until 26 September, when she left for Tsingtao, China, arriving the following day. There, she supported the 6th Marine Division until 13 November, when she returned to Incheon to take on Army soldiers as part of Operation Magic Carpet, the mass repatriation of millions of American servicemen from Asia and Europe. Alaska left Incheon with a contingent of soldiers bound for San Francisco. After reaching San Francisco, she left for the Atlantic, via the Panama Canal, which she transited on 13 December. The ship arrived in the Boston Navy Yard on 18 December, where preparations were made to place the ship in reserve. She left Boston on 1 February 1946 for Bayonne, New Jersey, where she would be berthed in reserve. She arrived there the following day, and on 13 August, she was removed from active service, though she would not be decommissioned until 17 February 1947. In 1958, the Bureau of Ships prepared two feasibility studies to see if Alaska and Guam were suitable to be converted to guided missile cruisers. The first study involved removing all of the guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160 million this was seen as too costly, so a second study was conducted. This study left the forward batteries‚Äîthe two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets‚Äîin place and added a reduced version of the first plan for the aft. This would have cost $82 million, and was still seen as too cost-prohibitive.Garzke & Dulin, p. 187 As a result, the conversion proposal was abandoned and the ship was instead stricken from the naval registry on 1 June 1960. On 30 June, she was sold to the Lipsett Division of Luria Brothers to be broken up for scrap.

Casting In March 2011, it was announced that Liberty Savage's (Abi Phillips) family would be introduced to Hollyoaks. Actor Danny Mac was cast in the role of Dodger Savage, the half- brother of Liberty and Will (James Atherton) and the adopted son of Dirk (David Kennedy), following a stint in the West End musical Wicked. Of his casting, Mac commented: \\"I am over the moon, the last few weeks have been crazy and Dodger's kept me on my toes every second. It's exciting never knowing what he's going to get up to next, and believe me the limits are endless. I can't wait for people to meet him! [...] I am proud to be a Savage and live in anticipation every moment to see what the next move is for the family!\\" Of the family and their introduction, a Hollyoaks spokesperson added: \\"The new family will take the village by storm and are set to rub all the McQueens up the wrong way. The Savage family get evicted from their home when Dirk can't keep up with the payments. [...] big brother Dodger has a new house for them to live in! While the McQueens are away on holiday, Dodger moves his family into the empty house and declares squatters' rights!\\" Development Characterisation Mac described Dodger as having the ability to \\"always find his way out of any mess\\" adding that Dodger was like \\"a crap Jack Bauer\\". He has explained that his character is \\"a bit cocky and he thinks that he's got it all\\". Speaking of Dodger's capability to settle down, Mac said he is \\"human being and as he meets people and forms relationships\\" so the character is capable of settling down. He added that there is more to Dodger than \\"just sleeping around and being cocky\\" which would be further explored in future. On the different sides of Dodger, Mac said they had been developed since he initially appeared citing the fact that people initially thought of the character as two-dimensional as proof. Dodger is described as \\"cheeky\\", \\"randy\\", a \\"charmer\\" and the \\"local womaniser\\". He has also been described as a \\"wily and quick-witted character\\". Family Mac hoped that his future storylines would include his character's relationship with his family, adding that he felt the chemistry between his onscreen family is \\"really good\\". Mac explained that there is not \\"much drama\\" in the Savage family and that they are \\"loyal to each other and very straight with their morals\\". Mac went on to add that future storylines would see the family brought together and would allow the audience to \\"discover more about them as a family\\". Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini) is later introduced as Dodger's cousin. Tracini explained that the family dynamic is \\"quite a real one\\" adding that people can relate to the family. Explaining the character's relationship with Dodger, he said Dodger is \\"not very happy\\" to see Dennis when he arrives and he tells Dennis he can not live with the family but despite this Dennis would usually side with Dodger in family disputes. Atherton said that Dennis \\"idolises\\" Dodger which leads to Will ignoring Dennis. Atherton said that there is a \\"brotherly rivalry\\" between Dodger and Will, explaining that it is due to Will becoming tired of Dodger getting all of their father's affection. He went on to add that the tension between the pair has been building and will soon come to a conclusion. During the conclusion Dodger and Will fight, which Atherton explained is a \\"proper brotherly scrap\\" as neither want to hurt the other but they show much anger and frustration during the fight. Relationship with Texas and Jodie Dodger has a casual relationship with Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove). Dodger also begins a casual relationship with Jodie Wilde (Montanna Manning). Texas and Jodie are also attracted to each other. Mac explained that the relationship between the trio is a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship. He added that the three characters are \\"so different\\" yet they share the trait of not wanting to be \\"tied down\\". On who his character is more attracted to of the two, Mac said it \\"literally depends on the day\\". He has a long history with Texas and is \\"massively attracted\\" to her although he likes that Jodie is attracted to both sexes. Mac cited Jodie's dance exams as developing the relationships. A Hollyoaks insider commented on the relationship, explaining that Texas is \\"torn\\" between the two as she has \\"felt the chemistry\\" with Dodger but she has a \\"closeness\\" to Jodie. Mac revealed that the relationship would continue to develop although he felt that Dodger needed to remain a \\"lone ranger\\" for the present. Mac hoped that there would be an eventual climax to the relationships. Biological Family and Mother In 2012, it was announced that Dodger real family The Blakes will be appear in the series. It was announced on 7 October that former Coronation Street star Jeremy Sheffield would be playing Patrick Charles Blake. Of his casting, Sheffield said: \\"I'm very happy to be joining Hollyoaks at a time when things are getting very exciting\\". Mac, commented on the character saying that Dodger \\"needs to find out who his father is and get some questions answered.\\" At the same time, his daughter Sienna Blake will appearance in the series. The character will played as with Emily Lawrance cast in the role. However, the role was recast with actress Anna Passey before the character made her on-screen debut. it was reveal that Sienna was Dodger's twin sister, the twin sibling Dodger never knew he had. Both characters made their first on-screen appearance on 21 November 2012. On 10 February 2013 it was announced that actress Saskia Wickham will play Dodger, Sienna, Will and Liberty estranged mother Anna Blake Daily Star. and the ex-wife of Patrick Blake and Dirk Savage. The reporter said that Anna would arrive in Hollyoaks with the revelation that Patrick has abused her, an accusation which he denies. A Hollyoaks insider said that when Anna arrives she \\"has a lot of questions to answer. Her children are going to struggle with her reasons for leaving\\". It was then revealed that Anna will arrived on 21 March, and Dodger will tell her about his and Will's past. Secret daughter On 20 May 2014, it was announced that actress Persephone Swales-Dawson will played as Nico Blake. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Nico arrives in Hollyoaks and meets Dodger. He takes pity on her and gives her food. A show spokesperson added \\"Is this girl just a passing tearaway teenager? Or could there perhaps be something more?\\". At first, she was taught to be his niece until on 4 September 2014, it was announced that Dodger was Nico's father and had a daughter with his twin sister Sienna. It was discover that Dodger and Sienna had met briefly years ago, and slept together, without knowing they were twins. A spokesperson told Digital Spy today: \\"Sienna and Dodger were estranged as children and each did not discover they had a twin until adulthood. When Nico was conceived 14 years ago, it was a chance meeting and they did not know that they were related.\\" In an interview with Danny Mac, conducted at the Inside Soap Awards 2014, Daniel Kilkelly noted how some fans loved the twist with Dodger being Nico's father, whereas others hated it. Mac commented that when Dodger finds out he will feel \\"physically sick\\", as he never could have \\"thought this could have been possible.\\" He also said that Dodger would strive to do the right thing, even if he didn't know what that was. In an interview with Digital Spy, Bryan Kirkwood stated that Dodger being the father of Nico had been discussed \\"right from the start\\", and that they pushed Dodger being the father due to the audience thinking that it was going to be Patrick, Sienna's father. Departure On 21 November 2014 it was announced that Mac had decided to leave the show; his final scenes are due to air in early 2015. It was revealed that Mac had decided to leave the show in October 2013, but producers kept his departure a secret until November 2014.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a611506/hollyoaks- actor-danny-mac-to-leave-dodger-savage-role.html#~oWfWHSaJtSLjbt Reception For his role of Dodger Mac won \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards. He was later nominated in the category of \\"Best Newcomer\\" at the 2012 National Television Awards. At the 2012 British Soap Awards Mac was nominated for \\"Sexiest Male\\". He has since been nominated for \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. For his portrayal Mac accumulated an online fanbase, which Mac felt was due to his character's \\"bad boy status\\". Colleague Joe Tracini, who plays Dennis, opined that Mac is \\"bloody brilliant\\" in his performance as Dodger. In April 2013, Kate White of Inside Soap questioned why Dodger and Will pursued Texas, because White felt Texas lacked personality, \\"Why on earth are Will and Dodger both so obsessed with Texas? The village fountain has more personality than her - and is only slightly less wet.\\" During his tenure, Dodger's appearance has been commented on by several media sources. Writing for All About Soap Laura Morgan said Dodger \\"is the true definition of a sexy soap stud\\" and said the magazine \\"love him\\" already. The Sun's television magazine Buzz branded Dodger a hunk and observed him as being an \\"instant hit with the ladies\\". Nick Levine writing for Digital Spy's gay men's blog \\"Gay Spy\\" felt Dodger's entrance into the serial in which he strips off was the way \\"to make an entrance!\\" He went on to post images of Dodger's entrance branding it \\"Danny Mac's torsotastic debut\\". Sophie Wilson of Heat also commented on Dodger's appearance, saying the character's part in a trailer for the serial is to stroll around and look \\"F-I-T as always\\". In his weekly Soap column Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton said he was unsure why Amy had sex with Dodger \\"other than he‚Äôs amazingly hot. Which might be reason enough\\".

As a pioneer in the field of Black Education his most notable accomplishments include the creation of the Institute for African American Affairs, the predecessor of the Department of Pan-African Studies and The Center of Pan-African Culture at KSU. The Pan-African Studies Department (1969) and the Center of Pan-African Culture (1970) were two of the first institutions of their kind to be established at institutions of higher education. Background and education Born and raised in the heart of Cleveland, Ohio, he was the fourth child born to Frederick Douglass and Marion (Naylor) Crosby. He attended Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament and St. Edward's, Catholic parochial elementary and middle schools. As a young altar boy Edward aspired to be a priest, at that time. He was a straight \\"A\\" student, as well. However, he veered from the straight and narrow path he started out on when he transferred out of St. Edward's in the eighth grade, unbeknownst to his parents. This change brought an abrupt end to his priestly aspirations, in 1948. His entry into Cleveland's public schools paralleled his involvement in a number of delinquent activities. He became an inveterate truant and his academics suffered tremendously. He continued to show glimmers of hope, that he might in time become a serious student and actually make something of himself. This was later borne out when he became a university professor and school administrator. His parents, especially his mother, never lost patience, nor did they allow themselves to forget the promise their son had showed early on. He earned his BA and MA from Kent State in 1957 and 1959 in German and Spanish and went on to earn a PhD from the University of Kansas in 1965. Oddly enough, his area of specialization was Medieval German Languages and Literature and Medieval History. In 1957 he began teaching at Kent State University and has since taught at a number of major and minor institutions around the country, including Hiram College, Tuskegee Institute, Southern Illinois University and the University of Washington. Career Dr. Crosby founded and served as the director of the Institute for African American Affairs for seven years, from 1969 to 1976. In 1976, the Institute petitioned the university for departmental status which gave birth to the Department of Pan-African Studies (DPAS); thus Dr. Crosby served for 18 years as the Department's first chair. The IAAA still exists, as a community development and research institute. The Department offers a multifaceted and holistic Africana Studies curriculum with a full-service educational world view, in Oscar W. Ritchie Hall, home of The Center of Pan-African Culture, which consists of The Henry Dumas Library, Mbari Mbayo Theatre and the Garrett Morgan Computer Lab, as well as a number of classrooms. The Institute for African American Affairs (IAAA), now known as the Department of Pan-African Studies (1976), used a holistic curriculum model based on Crosby's earlier work at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville (SIUE). The curriculum he developed for the Experiment in Higher Education was similar to another program that was being developed at that time, known as Upward Bound, in that the students were from urban areas with low high school graduation rates. Both programs were designed to help these students enter institutions of higher learning and graduate successfully. Upward Bound students typically showed promise. However, EHE students' test scores were not even on the border line. Crosby and his team developed a program that took that fact into account and developed another set of aptitude indicators to pick the 200 students that would be included in their program. Each of their teachers were also given training as counselors and therefore developed personal relationships with each and every one of their students. They also utilized a method of instruction that incorporated a methodology known as Each One Teach One, where the students instructed each other. Last, but not least, they validated the culture of the students they were working with by using examples, situations and language that the students were already familiar with to teach them subject matter they would encounter at any university. Notable accomplishments Creation of The East St. Louis Black Studies Model His work in the realm of Black Education really began in East St. Louis, IL, even though he had previously spent a little more than a year at Tuskegee Institute, AL, and a brief stint working with the Community Action Council in Akron, OH. As the director of education for the Experiment in Higher Education (EHE) Dr. Crosby and his team of fellow Kent State alumni developed a unique curriculum that taught their students what they needed for college without denying the culture of their respective communities. The program developed in East St. Louis under the direction of Crosby, Hyman Frankel and Don Henderson has been cited as the first African-centered collegiate curriculum in the U.S. Black Studies programs, departments and institutes were developed at the behest of Black communities across the nation. East St. Louis, with its Black community of 70,000 was no exception. EHE's influence on the development of Black Studies in universities across the nation was due in part to the amount of resources, time and brain power they had at hand to forge a pedagogy that put the student at the center of their learning. This Black Studies consortium did not confine their efforts to East St. Louis, they offered consulting services to universities from California to New York. One of the lessons of East St. Louis was the importance of an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to Black Education. In East St. Louis EHE was partnered with Katherine Dunham‚Äôs Performing Arts Training Center (PATC). The symbiotic relationship between EHE and PATC attracted educators, as well as cultural icons from all over the U.S. and beyond to East St. Louis, which generated a lot of energy in the community and attracted community members from all walks of life. On arriving at Kent, knowing the value of this kind of symbiosis, Crosby took on the task of developing an academic program modeled after the one he had previously spearheaded in East St. Louis and also took on the task of creating a cultural center that could work in tandem with the newly formed Institute for African American Affairs (IAAA). For 23 years this dual institution functioned with one purpose in mind, which was to provide an environment that reaffirmed the value of African-American culture while helping their students learn to use the academic skills necessary to graduate from a four-year institution in the study and promulgation of this culture. The implementation of this kind of Black pedagogy has led to the successful graduation of hundreds, if not thousands, of students, that wouldn't have made it otherwise, many of which have devoted their careers to working in Black communities all over the U.S. The Human Relations Center, which was founded in 1968, attempted to do this kind of work, however their perspective was that the students needed to assimilate. The Institute validated the students and their culture as worthy of emulation. The difference between the two could not be more clear cut. Black History Month pioneer Soon after arriving at Kent State he became one of the key organizers of the first celebration of Black History Month in the U.S., which occurred in February 1970. It was six years later, during the U.S. bicentennial, that the expansion of Negro History Week, as it had been called, was recognized nationally when then President Gerald R. Ford delivered to the nation regarding the observance of Black History Month. Since that time regular observances of Black History Month have become common in elementary, secondary and high schools, as well as city, state and federal buildings across the country. In fact, the practice has spread to many countries overseas, particularly in Europe. Significantly, the first celebration was a Pan-African affair that included the participation of cultural icons such as Babatunde Olatunji and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as poets Eugene Redmond and Quincy Troupe. Dr. Donald Henderson, then director of the Experiment in Higher Education, lectured on the Black Aesthetic. That first celebration of Black History Month also included presentations by Jimmy Garrett and Chief Fela Sowande, both of whom were involved in the formation of new institutions that had a decidedly Black aesthetic and international impact. Jimmy Garrett was a key player in the formation of the first Black Student Union and subsequently the first Black studies department in the U.S., while Fela Sowande was a Nigerian philosopher and musician of note who wrote Nigeria's first national anthem. He spent the latter days of his career teaching Black Cosmology in the Department of Pan-African Studies at Kent State University. Technology in the classroom Due to the bare bones budgetary allocations for the Institute of African American Affairs by university officials and the need to implement an innovative curricular model, there was also a need to come up with a unique method for delivering lectures that would be extremely cost effective. During his tenure in East St. Louis Dr. Crosby had begun to use some innovative methods of curricular delivery, including, but not limited to videotaped lectures, the use of various types of films and a method of communal education dubbed \\"Each One Teach One\\". All three of these methods were used at Kent facilitating the development of courses that could be taught by graduate assistants, who in many cases were later hired as full-time professors. This is how he developed a cadre of professors dedicated to Pan-African Studies. University officials had not foreseen this type of development of Black professors. Their original model incorporated professors from all over the campus, whose were dedicated to the philosophies and ideals of their individual departments; they would also have been hired, fired and paid by those departments. Because of this division of loyalty it would have been difficult, if not impossible to mold a conglomerate of professors from numerous departments into a staff with a cohesive set of ideals or philosophical imperatives. Other technological innovations include the first use of desktop computers in the main office of the Department of Pan-African Studies and one of the first computer labs for student use in an academic area unrelated to science or business classes. The Black Culture Center Upon arriving at Kent there were a number of demands that students had placed on the table, including a Black Culture Center. This center was something university officials had never dreamed of, hence they have resisted the idea from the beginning and never gave any type of significant funding to the center to be able to promote Black culture on Kent's campus. The center went through a number of phases and was located in a number of buildings before finally ending up in the Old Student Union, now Oscar Ritchie Hall. Dr. Crosby visualized the center and the Institute as institutions that should work in tandem with each other. The Center of Pan-African Culture was established in 1970, through the combined efforts of Crosby, his staff and the leaders of the Black United Students at Kent State, providing a home for students to engage in cultural activities and a home for IAAA. Today, the Center of Pan-African Culture still exists in a newly renovated Oscar Ritchie Hall, but the level of activities has seriously diminished, with the demise of the Pan-African Festival, last celebrated in 2007, the loss of much of the artwork that had graced the walls for the over 20 years and the relocation of the center of campus, Oscar Ritchie Hall is beginning to look more and more like a typical classroom building on any university campus.

Adriano Guarnieri Biography He studied at the Conservatory in Bologna where he got his diploma in musical composition with Giacomo Manzoni and another diploma in choral music with Tito Gotti. He started his activity as a conductor as well, founding the Nuovo Ensemble Bruno Maderna in Florence. He taught musical composition at the Milan Conservatory, Florence, Pesaro Conservatory and Bologna Conservatory. In his earliest works, from Musica per un‚Äôazione immaginaria to L‚Äôart pour l‚Äôart?, he tries to incorporate graphical elements into the music, and in so doing, he clearly shows his structuralist approach, which only later becomes more informal. Nafshi, Recit and other compositions show a turning point in his way of composing, since he pays more attention to the form, which is thought of as a synthesis of a fluid episodic multiplicity. Through his Pierrot series he was able to reveal a ‚Äòmelodic‚Äô component of his music which broadens in the opera Trionfo della notte (1986‚Äì87 season at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna), which won the Premio Abbiati as the best composition of the year. Among his later works are Romanza alla notte No. 2, for violin and orchestra (Parma, June 20, 1991), proof of the deep relationship existing between the composer and Pier Paolo Pasolini's poetics. He dedicated to Pasolini Il glicine, for soprano, reciting voice, amplified flute and violin (Milan, July 2, 1993). In Orfeo cantando... tolse..., ten lyric actions based on text freely taken by Poliziano‚Äôs Orfeo (1994), the beauty and the musicality of Poliziano‚Äôs verses, their expressive strength and their sound, the lyric aura surrounding their words, determine the musical form, and an idea of dramaturgy which is totally internal to the music and to the spatiality it created. His collaboration with Giovanni Raboni led to the creation of Quare tristis, for soloists, chorus, two instrumental groups, two tubas and live electronics (Biennale di Venezia, 1995). In 1999, in Strasbourg, the premiere of Pensieri canuti, cantata for soloists, chorus, two ensembles in double chorus and live electronics, again based on a text by Raboni; on April 6, 2000, at the Basilica di S.Marco in Milan, Passione secondo Matteo, linked to Pasolini‚Äôs film. On October 20, 2002, in Venice, the opera-video Medea, for soloists, chorus and orchestra, was premiered. In 2003 Medea was awarded the prestigious Premio Abbiati by the Italian musical critic in the section dedicated to novelties. In February 2004 in Turin La terra del tramonto was performed by the Orchestra Nazionale della RAI. The opera Pietra di Diaspro was premiered in 2007 for the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and Ravenna Festival. In 2013 he has started a collaboration with Tempo Reale, the centre for music research devoted to music technology based in Florence. With the musicians and technicians of the center Guarneri has realized three music work with an intense use of live electronics, premiered and performed in Florence, Ravenna, Torino, Spoleto.

It was built by a local company, but they struggled to raise money, and the line was in effect funded by local wealthy businessmen. It opened in 1891. In 1948 there was very heavy rainfall, and the viaduct that carried the line over the Eye Water was partly undermined, and the line was closed for year while repairs were undertaken. The line later succumbed to road competition, and it closed in 1962. Formation The Eyemouth RailwayAs early as 1846, when the North British Railway was in the earliest stages of its railway operation, representatives of the village of Eyemouth requested a branch line connection. At this period the North British was hugely committed financially and was concentrating on securing territory that might be attractive for competing railway companies to enter. Eyemouth did not fall into this category and the request was declined.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, In 1864 the request was repeated; the NBR was similarly committed, and responded coldly that they were prepared to work the line for 50% of gross receipts if local interests constructed it. Nothing was done. In the aftermath of the Eyemouth disaster of 1881, in which 189 fishermen perished at sea in a storm,Peter Aitchison Black Friday: The Eyemouth Fishing Disaster of 1881, Birlinn Limited, 2011, there was a mood locally to improve the village's economy. This was to be done by improving the harbour, and connecting the village to the nearby main line network. The Harbour was extended to 9.5 acres and deepened by two feet, and the middle pier was constructed. This work was decided upon at once, and was carried out in 1885 - 1887.Roland Paxton and Jim Shipway, Civil Engineering Heritage: Scotland, Lowlands and Borders, Thomas Telford Limited, London, 2007, The railway connection was to be to the North British Railway main line between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed, which ran nearby, and there was a station at Burnmouth, three miles away. The fishing fleet's catch, and the imported mussel bait, all had to be carted from Burnmouth.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Six local people met on 13 October 1881 to consider the matter, and they decided to build a railway without directly involving the larger concern. A public meeting a week later supported the idea, but actually raising the money for a line proved difficult. The Eyemouth Railway was incorporated by Certificate of the Board of TradeThe BoT certificate was a streamlined method of authorising railways where no compulsory purchase of interference with statutory rights was involved; it had been enabled by the Railway Construction Facilities Act, 1864. on 18 August 1884.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Once more the North British Railway agreed to work the line for 50% of gross receipts, with the Eyemouth company obliged to pay for the junction and other alterations at Burnmouth. The lack of money continued to be an obstacle, and the Directors, all local men without railway experience, disputed among themselves the choice of route, even though it had been determined in their Act, and the Board failed to start work. Construction A means of reducing the capital required for the line to ¬£22,000 was found with the help of G. B. Wieland of the North British Railway, in 1884, but even so share subscription was not forthcoming, and on 30 April 1889 the company's Parliamentary deposit of ¬£2,400 was forfeited. Its plight moved Sir James Percy Miller, 2nd Baronet, who lived locally and was a director of the North British, to take shares, as did Lord Tweeddale, and Wieland became Company Secretary. A working agreement with the NBR was confirmed, and construction of the 2.97 mile line began in July, from a junction at Burnmouth, running parallel to the main line for half a mile before turning coastward. An ill-timed explosive blast at the junction works almost derailed the Flying Scotsman on 24 October. It was built as a light railway, the only substantial engineering work being a high seven arch viaduct over the Eye. Blasting operation on the construction damaged the engine of the Up Flying Scotsman: > Burnmouth: Accident on the Railway. On Thursday morning, the Flying > Scotsman, which leaves Edinburgh for Berwick at 10 o'clock, met with an > alarming accident near Burnmouth Station.

The North British took a 999-year lease at a guaranteed 4% on the company's capital in March 1891, and the line opened on 13 April 1891.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, There was a passenger train service of six trains each way daily. The local promoters wished the railway to reach directly to the harbour, but this would have required passing through the village at considerable expense, and the NBR declined to build the extension. In 1894 the Harbour Trustees entered a Parliamentary Bill for further improvements to the harbour, and they included authorisation for the NBR to subscribe up to ¬£60,000 to the works, \\"in respect of the advantages derived by [the NBR] from the harbour\\". The NBR did not contribute. The North British Railway negotiated with the treasury and secured the return of the forfeited deposit of 1889. Seaside holidays in picturesque locations were becoming fashionable, and the railway brought the village a significant income from holidaymakers. The fortunes of the railway itself showed a gradual increase, and passenger income in 1913 was ¬£2,498, rising to ¬£12,102 in 1920. Goods receipts were ¬£1,628 (1913) and ¬£4,278 (1920). Short branch railways worked by, and leased by a dominant network company rarely lasted long, and the Eyemouth Railway was absorbed by the North British Railway by Act of 1 August 1900. Flooding in 1948 There was an exceptional rainstorm in August 1948; heavy rain started on Wednesday 11 August, and in 24 hours from 10 a.m. that day 4.6 inches of rain fell. The East Coast Main Line railway was breached, and a blocked culvert at Ayton impounded a huge volume of floodwater on land above the line, leading to fears for Eyemouth if the water suddenly became released. The centre pier of the Eye Water viaduct was \\"carried away\\" by the volume of water in the Eye watercourse.Berwickshire News, 17 August 1948 The line was reopened after construction of a replacement pier, on 29 June 1949.Berwickshire News, 5 July 1949 Closure The development of modern roads, and of road transport for goods and for passengers, caused a decline in the use of the short line from the 1930s, and on 5 February 1962 it closed to all traffic. Topography The 2.97 mile long branch left the main line at Burnmouth in a westerly direction, running parallel to the main line for half a mile, and then turning north and following the eastern slope of the valley of the Eye Water as far as Nettlyburn, where it crossed to the west side and ran down into Eyemouth, where there was a small terminus station, with a single platform, run round road and two goods sidings. The Eye Water viaduct, crossing also the mill leat of the Eyemouth Milling Company, was high, with six wrought iron lattice girder spans, resting on brick-faced concrete piers. The central pier was undermined in the 1948 flood and collapsed, though the girders remained in place. Its replacement was sunk into the gravel and also built of brick with a concrete filling, after diverting the river into a new channel near the third pier. Two other piers were also given extra protection.Railway Magazine, January 1950, page 11 Notes References See also  * 1955 one- inch map of the area * Facebook page with photographs and timetables * 1920 postcard of Eyemouth station Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:North British Railway Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Railway lines opened in 1891 Category:Railway lines closed in 1962 ","title":"Eyemouth Railway"},{"id":"34443763","text":"Scheduled offence may refer to: *An offence listed in a schedule to a statute indicating that the statute's provisions apply to such offences: ** Anti- Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999, Pakistan‚Äîscheduled offences are considered terrorist acts ** Arms Offences Act, Singapore‚Äîscheduled offences are liable to the death penalty ** Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971, Malaysia‚Äîscheduled offences are liable to the death penalty ** Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, India‚Äîdealing with the proceeds of crime of scheduled offences ** Terrorism Act 2000, United Kingdom‚Äîscheduled offences may have juryless trials *In particular, an offence which is tried in a special court instead of the ordinary criminal courts: **Diplock court‚ÄîNorthern Ireland, 1973‚Äì2007 ** Special Criminal Court‚ÄîRepublic of Ireland 1939‚Äì1946, 1961‚Äì62, and since 1972 See also * Criminal procedure in South Africa, offences on different schedules are processed differently ","title":"Scheduled offence"},{"id":"34443769","text":"Sudha Parimala is a Sanskrit work on Dvaita philosophy written by Raghavendra Swami.

The company is based in Lahore, Pakistan.Bicycle pedals down memory lane in Pakistan The Nation (newspaper), Published 20 April 2011, Retrieved 18 December 2018Sohrab Cycle in Lahore GoogleBooks website, Retrieved 18 December 2018 History The company began in 1952 with a core of traders in Lahore, following a foreign exchange crisis which severely restricted imports in Pakistan. The traders saw an opportunity to domestically produce and sell bicycles, and consequently founded Sohrab on 8 September 1953 under Section 9 of the Co-operative Societies Act II of 1912. It initially had 22 members and produced 5 bicycles a day. It now has 228 members and produces approximately 2000 bicycles a day. Structure Sohrab was setup keeping its workers in mind. All controlling powers of the company lay with the general body, who are elected into power every 3 years. Since its inception, elections have been held on a regular basis. Sohrab continues to maintain its social principles with a subsidized workers canteen and company hospital. It also pays for five of its workers to attend the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca each year. Products Sohrab initially manufactured a single-speed roadster bicycle. This had a lugged steel frame and rod-brakes. This bicycle is still in production more than 50 years later. More modern MTB and BMX style bicycles were added to the range in the 1990s. Sohrab have also diversified into producing cargo- tricycles, gymnasium equipment, push-chairs and wheelchairs. The latter are sold at cost price. In 1994, Sohrab entered the motorcycle market with the JS70. A larger version of this was later used as the basis for an auto- rickshaw. Markets Sohrab‚Äôs primary market is in mainly remote and rural population areas of Pakistan where the motorbikes and cars are still not affordable to some people. A few big city people ride the bicycles on the city streets for exercise and have formed bicycling clubs for themselves. Major export markets have also been established in Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Sohrab wheelchairs are also distributed in Madagascar through a French rotary club.

Festival Delle Sagre D‚ÄôAsti It is one of three main September events, the others being the Douja d'Or national wine show and the Palio of Asti that runs on the third Sunday of September. By established tradition it begins on Saturday night and runs all day Sunday: however, the Saturday evening event usually attracts the higher number of visitors. Over the course of two days, the festival now attracts about two hundred thousand visitors each year. The Sunday event starts with a colorful parade that winds through the streets of the city, depicting rural values and traditions of the province with more than three thousand characters in authentic period costumes. History The beginnings of the festival of Festivals can be traced to an idea of Giovanni Borello, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Asti, in 1974: his plan was to augment the Douja d'Or, essentially a wine competition, with a festival celebrating a bygone rural world. The organizers particularly stressed the gastronomic aspect of the event, presenting in one place the various local dishes of the area, complementing the local wines. Food and wine fair The Festival delle Sagre features Italy's largest open-air restaurant, offering a variety of authentic Piedmont cuisine. More than 40 Pro Loco organizations of the Province of Asti present their specialties, accompanied by Asti DOC and DOCG wines, from stalls set up in Asti's large, central 'Campo del Palio' square, arranged to re-create an old village atmosphere. Festival of festivals: inside one of the many stalls A popular Pro Loco Agnolotti, a typical local dish A glass of Barbera d'Asti, the official Sagre wine A price list Both written and oral recipes created by generations of rural people are used each year to present a menu of over eighty different dishes, prepared using ingredients that are typical for the Asti region. Some are unusual, such as rice with Barbera d'Asti, Polenta with wild boar stew, rabbit agnolotti, fried bleak (alborelle - a type of fish), farinata (belecauda in Asti dialect) or bollitto with bagnetto verde. Some dishes are prepared in almost industrial quantities - in 2004 over 4,000 kg of rabbit agnolotti were consumed - and are sold at affordable prices. A character in the parade Antique tractor in the parade The parade On Sunday morning, a long procession files through the Asti streets, based on the theme of country life up to the early twentieth century. The parade includes more than 3000 characters in authentic period clothing, work tools, furnishings and fixtures of all kinds, antique tractors, agricultural machines, wagons and tractors, plus a domestic zoo with various oxen, horses, mules, donkeys and other animals. The procession recreates scenes of peasant life, punctuated by the changing seasons, organized to resemble a living museum. The procession winds through the streets of downtown for about two hours, and culminates with the food and wine fair which runs from noon until the evening.

He worked in the National League from 1916 to 1920. He was an active NL umpire at the time of his premature death. Biography Early life and career Harrison was born in England and his family moved to Youngstown, Ohio when he was a child. Harrison took up umpiring as a young adult, spending 1911 to 1915 in minor league baseball. His minor league experience included the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League, New York State League and International League. National League career Although an Ohio newspaper reported in 1914 that Harrison would undoubtedly join the National League by the end of that season, the umpire actually made his major league debut in 1916. A June 1916 New York Sun article described a game in which fans hurled pop bottles and seat cushions at the new major league umpire: \\"A nervy fellow this Harrison. He stood with arms folded facing center field and never once winced, though it looked as if one missile nicked his leg.\\" In response to the incident, Harrison said, \\"What do I think of the Philadelphia fans? Well, this was the first time I ever saw them work, and judging by their form last Tuesday I should say that their control is bad. I wasn't hit once, although I heard that four spectators were struck by bottles. Harrison umpired 642 major league games in five National League seasons. On October 2, 1920, Harrison and Hank O'Day umpired the last major league tripleheader. Harrison worked behind the plate for all three games. He worked his final major league game the following day.Retrosheet Personal life During the baseball offseason, Harrison worked in a Youngstown steel mill. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus. Death Harrison died of tuberculosis on March 10, 1921 in Saranac Lake, New York. He had been brought there in grave condition a few weeks earlier. His case was said to be complicated by bouts with influenza and appendicitis that he had suffered in the previous year. He was survived by his mother, wife, daughter and four siblings. After his death, Rabbit Maranville said, \\"Every ball player in the National League will miss Pete Harrison. He's the kind of umpire we need. You could relieve your feelings on Pete, but if you got too fresh he was there to set you down. I was always strong for that boy, and I am deeply grieved over his death.\\" See also *List of Major League Baseball umpires References Category:1885 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Major League Baseball umpires Category:20th- century deaths from tuberculosis Category:British referees and umpires Category:Tuberculosis deaths in New York (state) ","title":"Pete Harrison"},{"id":"34443913","text":"Jasidih‚ÄìDumka‚ÄìRampurhat line is a section of Indian Railways under the Asansol division of the Eastern Railway.

The line connects the cultural capital of Jharkhand' Deoghar to the subcapital of Jharkhand, Dumka. History The railway line to connect Santhal Pargana with Bengal was conceived by the British in 1850s to exploit the natural resources but was not implemented due to Santhal rebellion of 1855. Demands were raised for a railway line many times after independence. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee approved the railway line and laid the foundation stone in 1999.https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160929/jsp/bihar/story_110809.jsp Map Jasidih Dumka Rampurhat line Status of the project The 71 km segment from Jasidih Junction to Dumka became operational on 12 July 2011. The track from Dumka to Ambajora Sikaripara became operational in June 2014. The track from Rampurhat to Pinargaria became operational on 25 November 2012.

Deoghar‚ÄìBanka railway line The construction of a new Deoghar‚ÄìBanka railway line is an associated project in the region. Deoghar is an important railway station on the Jasidih‚ÄìDumka‚ÄìRampurhat railway line. Due to the importance of Deoghar as a religious place, a railway line from Jasidih to Deoghar has been in existence for a long time. The old Deoghar railway station Baidyanathdham Deoghar railway station, however, was located inside the town, so the railway line could not be extended through densely inhabited areas. Therefore, a new railway line was built from Jasidih and a new Deoghar Junction railway station north of Deoghar was built. Two lines branch out from the new Deoghar railway station. The railway line to Dumka goes east of Deoghar. The new line to Banka goes towards the north and turns east and connects with Banka railway station passing through New Nawadih, Chandan, Bhalua, Katoria, Kharjhounsa. and Kakwara railway stations.

Its expanding collection includes more than 600,000 photographic objects from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Iran, Mexico, Argentina, and Senegal. History Arab Image Foundation was created in 1997 by photographers Fouad Elkoury and Samer Mohdad, and artist Akram Zaatari as a reaction to the lack of photographic archives in the region and the rapid disappearance of the few that remained. Lucien Samaha was one of the original members of the Arab Image Foundation. The collections reveal a large aspect of the social history of the Arab World, including the picture that Arabs have constructed of themselves since the creation of photography. The Foundation has become internationally and regionally recognized as the leading photographic institution in the Middle East. In addition to housing and conserving hundreds of thousands of photographs, the Foundation has spearheaded conservations and preservation projects in the Middle East, co-sponsoring workshops to disseminate the knowledge and skills needed to identify, restore, and conserve the Arab world's large photographic archive. In addition to on site facilities including a public space, a library, a research center and a laboratory, the AIF has organized multiple gallery and museum exhibits, and produced book publications, monographs, films, and collectible merchandise, such as postcards and posterbook publications and films.

He was the first Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer; he also held the office of Treasurer of Ireland, Chief Escheator, Custos Rotulorum of Kilkenny, and he also held numerous clerical benefices. His career was damaged by accusations of corruption and maladministration. He played an important role in the celebrated Kilkenny Witchcraft trials of 1324. Personal life Walter was born at Islip, Oxfordshire. He was a cousin of Simon Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury,Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.i p.61 and no doubt his career benefited as a result, though he was some years older than Simon. His most influential patron in his early years was Richard de Ferings, Archbishop of Dublin; he probably arrived in Ireland in the Archbishop's entourage in 1299. St Nicholas' Church, Islip- Walter was an Islip native Throughout his career Walter moved back and forth between Ireland and England. In Ireland he initially lived at the Priory of Kilmainham, but later purchased the manor of Thorncastle, in south Dublin County, which is roughly present day Mount Merrion.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2 p.4 He also had a town house in Dublin; there is a reference to Dublin Corporation supplying his house with water. He developed strong links with Kilkenny, where he usually lodged with the Outlaw family, who were at the heart of the Witchcraft trials. Career In 1308 he was chosen as one of the Barons of the new Court of Exchequer (Ireland); he was given the title of Chief Baron in 1309, but stepped down from office in 1311. He is mentioned again as a Baron of the Exchequer in 1335.Judges in Ireland p.61 He was appointed Chief Escheator of Ireland in 1310.Wright, Thomas, ed. \\"A Contemporary Narrative of the Proceedings against Dame Alice Kyteler\\" London Camden Society 1843 He served three terms as Lord Treasurer between 1314 and 1325. In 1325 he attended a seemingly routine Exchequer audit in London, where grave irregularities came to light. Serious questions were raised about Islip's integrity, and in one of the first examples of an official inquiry in Ireland, a Dublin jury was selected to determine the truth of the allegations of fraud and corruption against him. Alexander de Bicknor, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was accused of the same offences. Islip was finally removed from office as Treasurer, and imprisoned for a time in the Fleet Prison. In 1334 he was ordered to repay the Crown the considerable sum of ¬£1332, and in default of repayment most of his Irish lands were forfeited.Connolly, Philomena The Proceedings against John de Burnham Treasurer of Ireland 1343-49 in \\"Essays Presented to J.F. Lydon\\" Cambridge University Press 1993 p.63 In 1336 he obtained a royal pardon for all his faults and transgressions. He also held office as Custos rotulorum for Kilkenny. In 1329 he was engaged in litigation with one William de London; the striking feature of the case was that de London was represented by one of Islip's colleagues on the Bench, John de Grauntsete. Such conduct seems to have been unheard of even at the time: Cohen calls it \\"startling\\" and without parallel in legal history.Cohen, Herman History of the English Bar to 1450 1929 Sweet and Maxwell Reprinted 2005 p.272 De Grauntsete was soon afterwards removed from the Bench for a time: the reason for this was apparently not his conduct in Court, but the fact that he had read out letters of excommunication from the Pope.Judges in Ireland p.28 Kilkenny Witch Trials The Kilkenny Witch Trials of 1324, in which the principal accused were Alice Kyteler, her son William Outlaw and Petronilla de Meath, deeply divided the Anglo-Irish ruling class. This was partly because many of them were connected to Alice through her four marriages, and partly because the Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, the driving force behind the prosecutions, was bitterly unpopular. Islip seems to have been firmly on the side of the accused (William Outlaw was a personal friend): as Custos of Kilkenny he refused to order their arrest, and was probably a party to the Bishop's own arrest and brief imprisonment.Williams, Bernadette The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler History Today Vol. 2 (1994) Pluralist Although Walter, unlike his cousin Simon, did not reach the highest ranks of the Church, his career is a striking example of religious pluralism.History of Dublin p.4 In England he was vicar of Gresham, Norfolk and of Whittington, Derbyshire; in 1318 he became Dean of Wolverhampton. In Ireland he was a canon of St. Patrick's Cathedral, custodian of the Archdiocese of Dublin, Treasurer of Ferns Cathedral and a prebendary in the dioceses of Ossory and Waterford.

The position dates back about 750 years. History The position of Mayor in Monmouth was established in the thirteenth century by the people who were controlling the town's market. A seal was obtained from King Henry III confirming the rights and privileges of the position and the right to also establish bailiffs for the town. The position was confirmed in 1447 when Henry VI granted a charter to the town which permitted the town to raise taxes to pay for the town and also gave some freedom from the King's taxes. (Henry VI's father had been born in the town.) This charter confirmed the position of mayor as an annual elected position and agreed that two maces should be carried before the elected person. These maces survive and carry the arms of the Duchy of Lancaster. An elected mayor and bailiffs came to lead this body and by the middle of the thirteenth century a seal had been acquired from King Henry III with certain privileges. The office of mayor can be dated from this time. John Speed mentions the position again in 1611 when he itemises the authorities as a mayor, two bailiffs and fifteen councillors. This list is still true in 2012. In 1813 that was a court case concerning the over the influence of the Duke of Beaufort in the appointment of Mayors of Monmouth. The case was won by a team including local historian, Charles Heath but the Duke found other ways of gaming the system. Heath eventually became Mayor in 1819 and 1821. In 1835 the Municipal Corporations Act adjusted the powers but identified 1666 as the defining date of Monmouth's last charter. William Sambrook who was a local chemist and a keen supporter of Monmouth Baptist Church was elected Mayor of Monmouth nine times.

While the final episode scored a 29.9% rating. Critical response Both Dennis Trillo and Angelika Dela Cruz's performances were praised by critics and audience saying that having accomplished leads in the persona of Trillo and dela Cruz in clean-cut bida roles helps greatly in forging a connection to the story this early. After his recent roles in TV and film had him taking on more maangas, bad boy hero characters, it is a welcome change to see Trillo in a more good guy, older brother role. For [dela Cruz, this is her first opportunity for a long time to play as a heroine instead of an antagonist. And while she may be effective in villainous roles, dela Cruz has shown she is capable of much more. While Biritera may be a harmless family drama, it would be nice to see both Dennis Trillo and Angelika dela Cruz given great material, not to mention a promising and witty young cast. Though a simple premise, the first two weeks have shown Biritera can be a fully satisfying drama with opportunities for depth.

The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and was screened out of competition at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. Plot In the opening scene, set in 1973, the Troubles result in the death of her younger brother when they are children. The film jumps forward to 1993 Belfast, Colette is living with her mother and brothers. After a failed attack in London, Colette is arrested and offered a choice: either she spends 25 years in jail, thus losing everything she loves including her young son, or she becomes an informant for MI5, spying on her own family. Colette agrees to do so. An MI5 officer, Mac, is assigned as her handler. In return Mac offers a new identity to her after a period working for MI5. Soon Mac learns that his superior Kate Fletcher is using Colette to protect her mole inside the Irish organization. Mac tries to find the identity of the informer and protect Colette. A romantic interest develops between Mac and Colette, as they kiss passionately at their weekly meeting. Meanwhile, Kevin is an IRA enforcer, who realizes there is a mole within Greg's family. He gets closer and closer to Colette, while Mac's superiors refuse to remove her from danger. Finally, Kevin realizes that either Connor or Colette is the mole. Greg gives passive consent for Kevin to take action. Connor is tortured, but gives no information. Just as Connor is about to be executed, Kevin calls it off, determining Connor is not the mole. At the same time, Mac breaks in to secret archives and determines that the original mole is Colette's mother. He understands that he has been used by his superiors, who were only interested in Colette because she would have hidden her mother's treachery. Mac makes a phone call to Ma, informing her that the IRA is coming for Colette, and that Colette was recruited in order to protect Ma. However, as Kevin arrives, seemingly there to get Colette, Ma goes outside and enters Kevin's car. She is later shown to have been executed. Kevin had determined Ma was the mole, hiding Colette's involvement. Mac makes a phone call to Colette, warning her that he can get her and her son out. He is acting alone, outside the permission of his superiors. Given their romantic feelings for each other, it appears that they will make a run for it together. Mac arrives in his car. Colette, now no longer an IRA suspect, is relaxed and playing with a dog. Mac's cell phone rings in his car. When he answers it, a car bomb explodes, killing him. The film ends with Colette getting into a car with her brother Connor, and her son. Connor tells Colette that \\"it's done\\" and they have to leave. It becomes evident that Colette was playing Mac, and set up his death. Her true IRA colors are revealed, and her brother helps her and her son make their escape from British authorities.

The song was written in a satirical style which was based on his own brother‚Äôs discomfort at nursing their little baby sister.  Lyrics  Joe Wilson was probably the most prolific of all the Geordie songwriters of the time. Many of his works were published in his book of ‚ÄòSongs and Drolleries‚Äô which is a feast of dialect materials. This version is as follows:- Come, Geordie‚Äîha'd the Bairn or Aw wish thy Muther wad cum.

Then Geordie held the bairn, But sair agyen his will; The poor bit thing wes good, But Geordie had nee skill; He haddent its Muther's ways, He sat byeth stiff an' numb; Afore five minutes was gyen, He wish'd its Muther wad cum.

It was launched in July 2011, but after failing to achieve traction, Mozilla announced in January 2016 plans to decommission the service by the end of the year.Mozilla Stops Developing Its Persona Sign-In System Due To Low Adoption - Techcrunch, 12 Jan 2016 History and motivations Persona was launched in July 2011 and shared some of its goals with some similar authentication systems like OpenID or Facebook Connect, but it was different in several ways: # It used email addresses as identifiers # It was more focused on privacy # It was intended to be fully integrated in the browser (relying heavily on Javascript). The privacy goal was motivated by the fact that the identity provider does not know which website the user is identifying on. It was first released in July 2011 and fully deployed by Mozilla on its own websites in January 2012. In March 2014, Mozilla indicated it was dropping full-time developers from Persona and moving the project to community ownership. Mozilla indicated, however, that it had no plans to decommission Persona and would maintain some level of involvement such as in maintenance and reviewing pull requests. Persona services are shut down since November 30, 2016.Shutting down persona.org in November 2016 Principles and implementation Persona was inspired by the VerifiedEmailProtocol which is now known as the BrowserID protocol. It uses any user email address to identify its owner. This protocol involves the browser, an identity provider, and any compliant website. The browser, the provider and the website The browser stores a list of user verified email addresses (certificates issued by the identity providers), and demonstrates the user's ownership of the addresses to the website using cryptographic proof. The certificates must be renewed every 24 hours by logging into the identity provider (which will usually mean entering the email and a password in a Web form on the identity provider's site). Once done, they will be usable for authenticating to web sites with the same browser for the rest of the day, without entering passwords again (single sign-on). The decentralization aspects of the protocol reside in the theoretical support of any identity provider service, while in practice it seems to rely mainly on Mozilla's servers currently (which may in turn delegate email address verification, see identity bridging below). However, even if the protocol heavily relies on a central identity provider, this central actor only knows when browsers renew certificates, and cannot in principle monitor where the certificates will be used. Identity bridging Mozilla announced \\"identity bridging\\" support for Persona in July, 2013. As they describe on their blog: > \\"Traditionally ... Mozilla would send you an email and ask you to click on > the confirmation link it contained. With Identity Bridging, Persona learned > a new trick; instead of sending confirmation emails, Persona can ask you to > verify your identity via your email provider‚Äôs existing OpenID or OAuth > gateway.\\" This announcement included support for existing users of the Yahoo Mail service. In August 2013, Mozilla announced support for Identity Bridging with all Gmail accounts. They wrote in this additional announcement that \\"combined with our Identity Bridge for Yahoo, Persona now natively supports more than 700,000,000 active email users. That covers roughly 60‚Äì80% of people on most North American websites.\\"\\"Mozilla Makes Signing in Easy for Gmail Users ,\\" August 8th, 2013 Deployment Persona relies heavily on the JavaScript client-side program running in the user's browser, making it widely usable. Support of authentication to Web applications via Persona can be implemented by CMSs such as Drupal, Serendipity, WordPress,Mozilla Persona (BrowserID) Support TikiMozilla Persona or SPIP. There is also support for Persona in the Phonegap platform (used for compiling HTML5 apps into mobile apps). Mozilla provides its own Persona server at persona.org. It is also possible to set up your own Persona identity provider, providing federated identity. Notable sites implementing Persona include Ting, The Times Crossword, and Voost.

In 1907 a field at Bislett was secured for the future Bislett stadion, by the club's foremost administrator Martinus L√∏rdahl. The club changed its name to Oslo Idrettslag after the city Kristiania in 1924 changed its name to Oslo. KIF-hytta. The club acquired a sports cabin at Kols√•stoppen in B√¶rum in 1916. The cabin had formerly been displayed at the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition, as a contribution from the Norwegian Trekking Association. The cabin is still named KIF-hytta despite the name change from Kristiania IF. Athletics The club had some of the winningest athletes in Norway, mainly before the Second World War. By 1933, the men from Kristiania IF/Oslo IL had won 134 Norwegian championship titles as well as 13 in relay. The winningest athlete on the domestic level was Kaare Bache with eleven championships. He was a 1920 Olympian.Kaare Bache at Sports Reference Ferdinand Bie was a 1912 Olympic champion in pentathlon.Ferdinand Bie at Sports Reference Edvard Larsen won an Olympic bronze in 1908 and competed in 1912.Edvard Larsen at Sports Reference Other Olympians in the club include Otto Haug (1906),Otto Haug at Sports Reference Henry Olsen (1908),Henry Olsen at Sports Reference Nils Dahl (1908 and 1912),Nils Dahl at Sports Reference Oscar Larsen (1908 and 1912),Oscar Larsen at Sports Reference Birger Brodtkorb (1912),Birger Brodtkorb at Sports Reference Daniel Johansen (1912),Daniel Johansen at Sports Reference Herman Sotaaen (1912),Herman Sotaaen at Sports Reference Bjarne Guldager (1920),Bjarne Guldager at Sports Reference Einar R√¶der (1920),Einar Raeder at Sports Reference Einar Mangset (1920),Einar Mangset at Sports Reference and Einar Tommelstad (1928).Einar Tommelstad at Sports Reference Otto Monsen took one national title for Kristiania IF, but did not represent the club in the Olympics.

Ethiopia, from Bullets to the Ballot Box: The Bumpy Road to Democracy and the Political Economy of Transition. Lawrenceville, NJ: Red Sea Press, 1994. p. 87 The foundation of COPWE was declared through the proclamation 174 of the Derg military junta issued on December 17, 1979. Mengistu Haile Mariam was appointed as the chairman of the new organization.Shinn, David H., and Thomas P. Ofcansky. Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. p. 92-93 Mengistu declared the formation of COPWE in radio and television broadcasts on the same date. In his speech Mengistu stated that the Derg had always been aware of the need for a vanguard party, but that conditions had been lacking so far.Keller, Edmond J. Revolutionary Ethiopia: From Empire to People's Republic. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991. p. 201 COPWE would popularize Marxism-Leninism throughout the country, combat feudalism, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism and lead the people towards socialism. The proclamation that formed COPWE vested all powers in hands of the chairman Mengistu. Mengistu would be authorized to appoint members of the Central Committee, the Executive Committee (which later became the Politburo) and the Secretariat. Mengistu was empowered to issue rules for admission of individual members.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. pp. 70-71 A party press was established, the party newspaper Serto Ader and the theoretical journal Meskerem.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 76 The formation of COPWE was the culmination of the struggle between the Derg military junta and its political allies, a struggle that had taken place within Provisional Office for Mass Organizational Affairs (POMOA) and the Union of Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Organizations (Imadelih). Compared to its predecessors, COPWE was something of a hybrid. It was in part a government department like POMOA (created through a government proclamation and funded through the state treasury) as well as a supposedly voluntary association like Imadelih.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution 1974-1987 : a Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian. Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1995. p. 255 Notably, COPWE was able to establish a party cadre that remained stable throughout its existence. Leadership The Executive Committee of COPWE consisted of seven senior Derg officers, who also constituted the Derg Standing Committee (Mengistu, Fikre-Selassie Wogderes, Fisseha Desta, Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan, Berhanu Bayih, Addis Tedla and Legesse Asfaw) as well as four civilians. The latter were nicknamed 'the Gang of Four'. The key member of the 'Gang of Four' was Shemelis Mazengia. The other three were Alemu Abebe, Fassika Sidell and Shewandagne Abebe. These four civilians were entrusted with running of the daily affairs of the party.Keller, Edmond J. Revolutionary Ethiopia: From Empire to People's Republic. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991. p. 237-238 The Executive Committee also had six alternate members.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution 1974-1987 : a Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian. Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1995. p. 258 The leading bodies of COPWE were dominated by people from the armed forces. Around two thirds of the Central Committee members had a military or police background. All 16 government ministers were members of the Central Committee (only one of them was an alternate member). Ato Hussein Ismail who was the first Somali to become a Politician in Ethiopia and lay the foundation for Somali inclusiveness into Ethiopia was also part of the Central Committee. There was only one woman, Tiruwork Wakoyo, in the Central Committee. Officially Fisseha Desta was the First Secretary of COPWE, but in practice Legesse Asfaw (Head of Organizational Affairs) led the Secretariat. The Secretariat consisted mainly of civilian ideologues, under the supervision of senior Derg members.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 72 According to Peter Schwab, citing a 1980 article in the Ethiopian Herald, two thirds of the Central Committee members were Amharas.Abraham, Kinfe.

Lawrenceville, NJ: Red Sea Press, 1994. p. 124 First Congress The first congress of COPWE was held on June 16-19, 1980. The congress established the strengthening and politicizing of mass organizations as key priority. The All-Ethiopian Trade Union and the All- Ethiopian Peasants Association were to be reconstructed. The congress called for the founding of the Revolutionary Ethiopia Youth Association and the Revolutionary Ethiopia Women's Association.African studies in the Soviet Union: yearbook. 1986. p. 77 Organizational build-up The Central Committee met in plenary sessions once per year.Abraham, Kinfe.

Lawrenceville, NJ: Red Sea Press, 1994. p. 87 The second plenary session of the COPWE Central Committee, held in February 1981, marked the first time after the 1974 military takeover than government policies were declared through a party organ rather than the Derg military junta. Regional COPWE representatives were appointed in June 1980, but except for Eritrea the appointed representatives were the incumbent military chief administrators. These two posts were separated in late 1981, thus establishing parallel party and state hierarchies in the regions.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia.

All candidates were screened by COPWE prior to the vote.Cowen, Michael, and Liisa Laakso. Multi-Party Elections in Africa. Oxford: J. Currey, 2002. p. 63 COPWE then moved to create party structures on district levels. The first district organization was created in Assab in April 1981. The appointed district representative was Eshetu Aleme. Afterwards district organizations in Jimma and Dessie were set up. At the time of the second COPWE congress, half of provinces had district-level party structures. By June 1982 there were 436 basic party units across the country. Out of them 162 were party units in the armed forces, down to brigade level.Clapham Christopher. Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia.

Transformation and Continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 75 But the Soviets grew impatient with the slow development of COPWE. The Soviets sent a large cache of Marxist literature to COPWE, hoping to improve its ideological level. The first cooperation agreement between COPWE and the Soviet Communist Party was signed on October 12, 1982.Patman, Robert G.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009. p. 267 Second Congress and foundation of the Workers' Party The second COPWE congress was held on January 3-6, 1983. Around 1,600 people attended the event. By this point the mass organizations of the party claimed a membership of 1.3 million. In his speech to the congress, Mengistu claimed that COPWE had been able to establish around 6,500 party cells throughout the country. The congress issued a call for the creation of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia. The new party was founded in September 12, 1984, substituting the COPWE.Clapham Christopher.

Subsequently, he worked as a teacher of Latin, Greek, German and English at several private schools in the country and was even reader of the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. In 1858 he was appointed professor of Greek philology at the well known imperial Col√©gio Pedro II in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Col√©gio Pedro II was the highest and most prestigious school in the country at this time. He also became a professor of German language at the Instituto Commercial do Rio de Janeiro in 1860, where he taught at the same time. In 1860 his work on the grammar of the German language \\"Grammatica da lingua alem√£\\" appeared in Portuguese, which contained a new method for translating and learning the German language. He also translated literary works from Portuguese into German and from German into Portuguese. In 1865 he published his Portuguese translation of the \\"Greek grammar\\" of the German classical scholar Raphael K√ºhner.

In 1989, at the Buenos Aires meetings of the International Institute of Public Finance, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Professor of Economics Edgar L. Feige proposed extending the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes,Keynes, J.M. (1936). The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace, New York, NY. James Tobin and Lawrence Summers, to their logical conclusion, namely to tax all transactions. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax (APT tax) proposed taxing the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate. Since all transactions must ultimately be paid for by a final means of payment, namely via a transfer from a bank account or by settlement with currency, Feige proposed collecting his tax by levying the tax automatically on the debit and credit entries to bank accounts, thereby splitting the tax between the buyer and seller of every transaction. The APT tax is a uniform flat-rate tax on all transactions, assessed and collected automatically whenever there is a debit or credit entry to a bank account. As such, it is can be viewed as a bank transaction tax. Since financial transactions account for the greatest component of the APT tax base, and since all financial transactions are taxed, the proposal eliminates substitution possibilities for evasion and avoidance. The goal of the APT tax is to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection, and compliance costs).\\"Dreaming Out Loud: One Tiny Little Tax\\", Daniel Akst for the New York Times. 2 February 2003.Peter J Reilly for Forbes. 28 October 2012 \\"Balanced Budget And Comprehensive Tax Reform Made Simple ?

Patrick R Colabella and Richard Coppinger, Professors of Accounting and Taxation at St John's University, New York introduced a variant version of the (APT tax) tax called the Withdrawals tax at an International Conference on tax reform at the World Trade Center in 1999. The WTX as it is called, taxes only withdrawals from designated personal and business bank accounts and can raise $9.3 trillion at a rate of 5% of a tax base of $186 trillion. The concept was also submitted to the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform in 2005. It was reintroduced in 2016 in the book \\"How to get Rid of Socialism and Cure the Fiscal Ills of the United States of America.\\" It makes the case for replacing the income tax, sales tax, and estate tax and demonstrates that by eliminating these tax systems it would effectively constrain Socialist redistribution programs that are income tax based. The book also claims the utility of the WTX system of taxation system effectively extends to the control of the shadow economy and cyber currencies and that the WTX can generate enough revenue to electronically fund all economic security obligations of the federal government ( I.e.Social Security and Medicare). History Australian bank account debits tax Australia charged a tax on customer withdrawals from bank accounts with a cheque facility (both withdrawals made by cheque or by another means, such as EFTPOS). The tax was introduced by the federal government in 1982. The power to levy the tax was transferred to the states in 1990, except for Norfolk Island which did not charge it. The tax was abolished by the states on dates between 1 July 2002 and 1 July 2005 as part of the package of reforms for the introduction of the goods and services tax. Latin America As globalization eroded the efficiency of conventional taxes such as value added taxes, various Latin American countries applied new taxation levied on bank transactions. Argentina introduced a bank transaction tax in 1984 before it was abolished in 1992. In 1993 Brazil implemented a temporary \\"CPMF\\" tax at a rate between 0.25% and 0.38% to fund its health system. The tax lasted until 2007. In 2011, during the presidential election, there was renewed discussion about a possible re-introduction of the CPMF under the name \\"Social contribution for health\\" (CSS).Oposi√ß√£o derrota governo e Senado rejeita prorroga√ß√£o da CPMF - Folha Online, 13 December 2007see also Portuguese Wikipedia article The broad-based tax levied on all debit (or credit) entries on bank accounts proved to be evasion-proof, more efficient and less costly than orthodox tax models. Furthermore, the significant revenue-raising capacity of bank transactions taxation revived the centuries-old ideal of the Single Tax. In 1998 Ecuador introduced the \\"Impuesto a la circulacion de capitales\\" or tax on money circulation, at a rate of 1% of deposits made into Financial Institutions. This tax was introduced in lieu of Income Tax and was meant to provide an amount of revenue at least equal to income tax without the administrative cost of such a tax. The initial result of this tax was massive withdrawals of cash from Banks prior to the tax being charged and disintermediation as economic agents avoided the use of banks to avoid the tax.Dr.Raul Tamayo, Impuesto a la circulacion de capitales, derecho Ecuador. 2005 Revenues from this tax was about half of the expected and halfway through 1999 Income tax was reintroduced, and the tax rate reduced to 0.80%. In the year 2000 the tax was repealed.

Origins  NCB Radio was originally formed in November 2009 by former Bodmin College radio station manager Aaron James as Bodmin Community Radio, to be a community radio station focusing on Bodmin, Cornwall. Bringing on board the team he worked with at Bodmin College Radio when it became defunct upon his departure in July 2009 alongside then Radio Pembrokeshire presenter Dave Gould, it morphed into ‚ÄúNorth Cornwall‚Äôs BC Radio‚Äù (BC Radio being a deference to the project‚Äôs origins) in March 2010 when it became evident that a radio project solely for Bodmin would not be financially sustainable, combined with the realisation that North Cornwall was underserved as an area in terms of media output. A trial broadcast also took place during June 2010, encompassing live broadcasting at the year‚Äôs Royal Cornwall Show. This in turn became NCB Radio in November 2010 through a rebranding to reflect the project‚Äôs new name: North Cornwall Broadcasting.

Her books are based on autobiographic narratives related to her childhood within the Lebanese Civil War. Work Zeina Abirached was born in 1981 and was raised in a war-torn Beirut. In 2002, she produced a little comic book composed of black and white drawings within the Atelier de Recherche ALBA. Her training as a commercial designer brought a decorative approach and inventive graphic solutions to her black-and-white comics. She later moved to Paris and continued producing comics based on individual and collective memory and on archival documents. She finds her inspiration in old photographs and TV footage, and in the work of comic authors such as David B and Jacques Tardi. Abirached's memoir Mourir, partir, revenir - Le Jeu des hirondelles was the first graphic novel to be awarded the FACE French Voices Grant for publication of a contemporary French-language work in English, given by the PEN American Center and the French Embassy. It was published by the Graphic Universe division of Lerner Publishing Group in 2012 under the title A Game for Swallows: To Die, To Leave, To Return. Through her works, she portrays not just the memoirs of the civil war in Lebanon, but also reclaims a history that has been either ignored by official accounts of the war or been forgotten completely.

It is also notable for containing a rose window by Hugh Ray Easton and a pipe organ by Henry Willis II of Henry Willis & Sons.  History  For centuries Bishop's Stortford was a single parish. In response to swelling congregation numbers, it was divided into three by the vicar of St Michael's, Bishop's Stortford, Francis. W. Rhodes, father of the magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes. The first church of All Saints', Hockerill was built in 1851, designed by local architect George Pritchett and consecrated on 7 January 1852. It was a Commissioners' church, having been built with money voted by Parliament. The new parish was created and assigned to the new church by Queen Victoria on 2 February 1852. John Menet was both the first Vicar of the parish and the first Chaplain of the neighbouring Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses (1852), the latter now replaced by Hockerill Anglo-European College.\\"The Re- opening of All Saints' Church, Hockerill\\" On Friday 21 June 1935 the church was gutted by a fire, making national news. Villagers first tried to put out the fire, but retreated when the fire spread to the roof. The vicar, Reginald J. Mockridge, and villagers managed to save items from the burning building including the Communion plate, records and lectern.\\"Village Church in Flames\\" The roof collapsed within half an hour and the smoke was so dense that gas masks had to be used by the firemen. The firemen were able to do little, owing to a lack of water. Funds for the new church were already being collected the same day of the fire. The new church cost a total of ¬£27,178 (approximately ¬£1.4m today), of which ¬£9528 was raised publicly (approximately ¬£0.5m today).Smith p.59 This involved an auction to which Queen Mary of Teck gave a pair of vases, The Duchess of York (later Elizabeth the Queen Mother) gave a parchment blotter and picture of Princess Elizabeth (now Elizabeth II), and film stars gave autographed photographs. The foundation stone was laid on 20 July 1936 and the new church was consecrated on 24 July 1937.Orton p.36  Architecture  West front The 1936 church was Dykes Bower's first church, starting his lifelong work on churches in the Gothic revival style. In one opinion it is his best church, combining a traditional plan and artistic coherence with a freedom from stylistic convention that makes it stand apart from most churches of the time.  Exterior  Looking down the nave to the west end The west front dominates the east side of Bishop's Stortford with its tall, broad central tower and distinctive steep saddleback roof, and three impressively tall lancets. The use of Kentish ragstone facings creates a monumental effect, reinforced by buttresses that flank the aisles and chancel.Symondson p.15 At the south west entrance there is a 19th-century timber lych gate, which is the only part of the original 1851 church that was not damaged by fire.Pevsner p.102 Indeed, Dykes Bower's brief included the need to use the remains of the old church, a strategy he later employed when rebuilding the destroyed church of St John the Evangelist Church, Newbury.  Interior  The church's simple layout is of a nave and two flanking aisles, leading to a long aisle-less chancel. However, it starts with a narthex at the base of the tower, containing the baptistery, which is in direct line with the high altar. The simple but noble interior is made bright and airy by vast open spaces, many lancet windows, and plastered walls. The impressive height of the nave (45 ft or 14m) is accentuated by giant drum piers and gothic pointed arches, which hold a coffered wagon roof. The airy, refined interior and coffered roof are later reflected in Dykes Bower's church of The Holy Spirit, Southsea, Hampshire, and in his work on the chancel and transepts at St. Edmundsbury Cathedral, including the Cathedral's oriel window, which is foreshadowed by the oriel window at All Saints'. Distinctive to All Saints', the chancel is dominated by an east rose window (see below). Sitting within the church's Gothic setting, the furniture is of a Classical style, including four classical pillars that surround the high altar.Symondson p.12 Rose Window by Hugh Easton  Rose window  Elevated organ case and oriel window The interior's focal point is an rose window with flowing cusped tracery, designed by Hugh Ray Easton (1906‚Äì65), and situated at the east end above the high altar. The window is the principal component that adds colour to the building; the window's variety of intricate geometric shapes and rich, deep colours are accentuated by the building's plain walls and stone. As is traditional, the central roundel depicts Christ in Majesty, with the lights around him depicting the emblems of the Gospel writers, apostles, and heraldry of dioceses associated with the parish. The design is similar to Dykes Bower's rose window at Lancing College Chapel, in respect that both are in the Rayonnant rose window style with pointed-arched mullions radiating from a central roundel, and with outer lights depicting church heraldry.  Willis Organ  The two manual organ was built in 1937 by Henry Willis II of Henry Willis & Sons. The pipes are positioned in an elevated case on the north wall of the chancel, exploiting the building's excellent acoustic. The case was designed by Dykes Bower, with the 16 ft Open Diapason pipes on display. Its specification can be found on the church's official website (see external links).  All Saints' Today  All Saints' is in the Affirming Catholicism tradition of the Church of England, and caters for other traditions. There are eight regular services of varying styles. There is a children's Sunday school, a youth group, a film club, a Mother's Union, two home groups, and teams of pastoral visitors, altar servers, readers and flower arrangers. A robed choir sings every Sunday, and a children's choir sings at the All-Age Mass. The building is a popular venue for concerts owing to its excellent acoustic. The church is linked to All Saints' Church of England Primary School and Nursery. The building is usually open during the day between 9am and 6pm.

Life Shuttleworth was born in Dawlish, Devonshire, the eldest son of James Shuttleworth (died 1846) of Barton Lodge, Preston, Lancashire, by his first wife, Anna Maria, daughter of Richard Henry Roper, dean of Clonmacnoise. His mother died of consumption a few weeks after his birth. His father married again in 1815, and settled in Switzerland, subsequently (in 1834) selling the Barton property. Shuttleworth, who was mainly brought up by his mother's relatives, was sent to school at Geneva, first under Rodolphe T√∂pffer, and afterwards under the botanist Nicolas Charles Seringe, keeper of the De Candolle Herbarium. He studied plants on the mountains near Geneva. At age 17 Shuttleworth went to Germany, passing a winter at Saxe-Weimar, where he saw court life and came to know Goethe. He spent some time at Frankfurt and Heidelberg, before his father recalled him to Solothurn; there the family were then living, fearing he might become too burschikos. Shuttleworth maintained his devotion to botany, and made a considerable collection in the Jura during the summer of 1830. From the autumn of that year until the end of 1832 he studied in the medical faculty of the University of Edinburgh, walking the hospital during the first outbreak of cholera, making a vacation tour in the Scottish highlands, and helping his elder stepbrother Blake on his estate at Renville in the west of Ireland during the famine of 1831 and 1832. On 11 January 1833 Shuttleworth was appointed to a captaincy in the Duke of Lancaster's own regiment by the lord- lieutenant of the county (Whittle, Preston, 1837, ii. 235), but, returning to Solothurn in the following winter, he married Susette, daughter of the Count de Sury of Soleure, and settled at Bern. They had two children, his son Henry, and a daughter who died at the age of seven. Here Shuttleworth collected on the Grimsel and the Oberland, and worked particularly on red snow and other freshwater algae, until weakness of the eyes compelled him to abandon the microscope. In 1835 he purchased the extensive herbarium and library of Joseph August Schultes of Z√ºrich, the botanical collaborator of Johan Jacob Roemer. Between 1840 and 1850 he became intimate with Jean de Charpentier of Bex, a zealous botanist who had taken to conchology. Charpentier temporarily inspired Shuttleworth with his own zeal for his new subject. Shuttleworth spent money freely on his researches, sending, at his expense, the collector Blauner of Bern to Corsica, the Canaries, and ultimately to Puerto Rico, where he died of consumption. Rugel, a very active collector in North America, and other travellers in Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil were also largely supported by Shuttleworth, who bought their collections of shells, plants, seeds, &c.; The plants he partly worked out, thus forming a very extensive and valuable annotated herbarium. Shuttleworth usually wintered in the south, owing to his tendency to gout, and, despite frequent disablement, ransacked the rich botanical hunting-ground of Var and Alpes-Maritimes. This resulted in a herbarium, formed jointly by several friends, now in the possession of M. Edmond Huet at Pamiers (Ari√®ge), and in a Catalogue des Plantes de Provence, which was published by M. A. Huet at Pamiers in 1889. Many of his botanical discoveries were in part due to his constant comparison of French with Italian types, while his letters to his friends Meissner, Godet, Guthnick, and others, and the notes in his herbarium evince the critical caution which made him apt in botany, as in conchology, to insist on minute differences. In 1866 his only son Henry, a promising student of medicine at Cambridge and London, died, aged 22, at his summer residence, Frohberg, near Bern. Overwhelmed with grief, Shuttleworth removed to Hy√®res, and gave up scientific work. He died on 19 April 1874. Shuttleworth joined the Botanical Society of Edinburgh as an original member in 1836, became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1856, and was also an associate of the Zoological Society and of the Lyceum of New York. The University of Basle conferred a doctor's degree upon him for his services to science, and Meissner commemorated him in the genus Shuttleworthia, now merged in Verbena. His collection of shells, considered by Mousson (Journal de Conchyliologie, xxiii. 99) one of the most remarkable in Europe, was presented after his death to the State Museum at Bern, and his herbarium of more than 150,000 specimens of flowering plants and twenty thousand cryptogams was added to the British Museum collection. An account of the various collections comprised in this herbarium appears in the official report of the department of botany in the museum for 1877 (Journal of Botany, 1878, pp. 179‚Äì80). Works Besides an Account of a Botanical Excursion in the Alps of Valais in Jardine's Magazine of Zoology and Botany for 1835 (vol. ii.), the Royal Society's Catalogue enumerates eighteen papers by Shuttleworth, beginning with a description in German of some North American species of Valerianella in Flora, vol. xx. (1837), including several contributions, mostly malacological, to the Mittheilungen d. Naturf. Gesellschaft of Bern, and ending with an Essai critique sur quelques esp√®ces du genre Cyclostoma in the Journal de Conchyliologie for 1856 (vol. i.). Some of these papers deal with the land and fresh-water shells of Corsica, the Canaries, and the West Indies; others with the formation of loess. He also published separately: 1. Nouvelles observations sur la mati√®re coloriante de la neige rouge, Geneva, 1840; and 2. Notiti√¶ Malacologic√¶, Heft i., Bern, 1856, dedicated to Jean de Charpentier, and consisting of an introduction on classification and nomenclature (pp. 1‚Äì29), and a monograph of five little known genera of land-shells (pp. 30‚Äì90), most of the species being described as new, with nine lithographic plates, eight of which are unsigned, and presumably by the author, the last by A. Hutter. The second part of this work, which is written in German, was issued in 1878, and consists of fifteen plates, coloured by Shuttleworth, put on stone by Hutter, with descriptions by Shuttleworth, edited with synonymy by Dr. Paul Fischer, with a preface by Professor T. Studer and a Nekrolog von R. J. Shuttleworth, by Shuttleworth's friend Guthnick, director of the Bern Botanical Garden.

It consists of a large rectangular container about 50 meters in length, and a set of vertical screws attached to a crossbar. The crossbar moves horizontally across the length of the container while the motion of the screws raise the barley from the bottom to the top. Combined with mechanical air flow across the barley for cooling, this allows for beds of barley between and deep to be turned over two or three times a day. The screws are moved and turned by a system of pulleys and belts. The Saladin box was invented by the French Lt. Colonel Charles Saladin (1878‚Äì1942) in the late 1800s to overcome the problem where the roots of the malting barley would become entangled if not regularly turned by hand, forming large mats unusable for further processing, as encountered in the earlier system that used artificial air flow to cool the barley in deeper beds designed by Galland. The first U.S. brewery to use the Saladin system was John A. Huck Brewery in Chicago, Illinois. Modern malting devices use a similar systems of screws as those invented by Saladin, but use ribbon screws rather than closed screws, perforated floors for aeration and cooling, and circular vessels instead of rectangular boxes In Scotland there's only one distillery that still uses the Saladin box: Tamdhu. This distillery uses two such boxes to fill the kiln, and two steeps to fill the box. Tamdhu was, incidentally, also one of the first Scottish distilleries to install a Saladin box.

Numbering about 200 men at its peak, it was unique in the history of the Rhodesian Army as an exclusively expatriate unit. It existed between November 1977 and May 1978 as a company in the 1st Battalion, the Rhodesia Regiment, and served two counter-insurgency tours on Operation Hurricane in north-eastern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe). During the Bush War, the Rhodesian Army augmented its ranks with foreign volunteers, who were accepted into regular regiments with the same pay and conditions of service as locals. Most foreign recruits enlisted in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), which launched an overseas recruitment programme in 1974, but required successful applicants to speak good English. The Army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting French-speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment for them. The regiment already had six independent companies, so the francophone unit became 7 Independent Company. The company's men, a mixture of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start integrating with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently under the impression that they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier. On operations their performance was generally below par, but the Frenchmen were involved in some successful actions during February and early March 1978. Their oppressive treatment of the black villagers they encountered made them very unpopular in the operational area. The Rhodesians quickly deemed the experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for the company during the latter part of its second tour, including two friendly fire incidents and several fatalities, it was disbanded in May 1978. Forces led by one of its members, Bob Denard, later that month executed a coup d'√©tat in the Comoros with French, Rhodesian and South African governmental support.  Background  The alt=A map. See description Following a dispute with the British government regarding terms for the granting of full independence, the predominantly white minority government of the self- governing colony of Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia), led by Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. Britain and the United Nations refused to recognise this and each imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Meanwhile, the country's two most prominent communist-backed black nationalist groups, the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People's Union, mobilised their respective guerrilla armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), for what they called the \\"Second Chimurenga\\", with the goal of overthrowing the government and introducing black majority rule. The Rhodesian Bush War was the result, beginning in earnest on 21 December 1972 when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms near Centenary in the country's north-east. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched Operation Hurricane in response and fought back strongly, reducing the number of guerrillas active within the country to under 300 by December 1974. In the period October‚ÄìNovember 1974, they killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined. However, a South African-brokered ceasefire, which the security forces respected and the insurgents ignored, helped the nationalists to win back ground. By 1977 there were 2,500 guerrillas operating in Rhodesia, with several times that number in training abroad. The Rhodesian Army, though mostly made up of local men, also included some foreign volunteers, who were integrated into regular units under the same salary and conditions of service. Almost all of the foreigners served in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), a heliborne commando battalion with a glamorous international reputation. The RLI initiated a major overseas recruitment drive in 1974, targeting potential volunteers from Europe, Oceania and the Americas, and requiring successful applicants to speak good English. This campaign was bearing considerable fruit by May 1976, when the RLI's largest ever intake included more foreign volunteers than any before, and the enlisting of men from overseas into the RLI would increase yet further. By 1977‚Äì78 there were around 1,500 foreigners in the Rhodesian forces. However, the Rhodesian Army remained stretched and low on manpower.  Formation and training  The idea for a francophone unit came from a French national, Fran√ßois Cramer, who had business interests and connections in Rhodesia. He proposed it to Major- General Sandy MacLean, then the Rhodesian Army's second-in-command, while they were visiting France together. MacLean relayed the idea to the General Staff in Salisbury, which decided in late 1977 to form a \\"French battalion\\" to alleviate the strain on its regular units. A Rhodesian officer of French extraction, Cyril Bernard, warned his superiors strongly against the scheme, but was ultimately himself sent to France to start the project. On the way he stopped in Zurich, Switzerland, where MacLean gave him final approval for the operation and a budget of US$30,000. They resolved to recruit mainly in Paris and Lyon. Bernard then entered France and renewed old connections from the French military academy at Saint-Cyr. Recruitment was carried out by a former French paratrooper, Roger Bruni, operating from an apartment on Rue Bachaumont in central Paris. Advertisements, placed in newspapers such as France Soir, offered \\"a job with a future abroad ... minimum age 22, former non- commissioned officers preferred\\". The body of men eventually assembled varied widely in terms of age, background and experience, but was based largely around ex-paratroopers and former Foreign Legionnaires. The average age was about 25. French-speaking veterans of an assortment of African and Middle Eastern conflicts spanning the previous two decades successfully applied, but past service did not prove a necessity; some of the men accepted had no military experience. Most of them spoke English only at a basic level if at all. French tricolour (pictured) at its camp alongside the flag of Rhodesia.|alt=A vertical tricolour with blue, white and red stripes flies from a white flagpole before a clear blue sky. Once signed up, each man was instructed to travel to Switzerland, where appropriate visas were swiftly procured from the South African Embassy. In early November 1977, the French recruits flew from Zurich to Johannesburg on a South African Airways liner, then to Salisbury by Air Rhodesia. Already in Rhodesia waiting for the men were their leaders: Major Roland de l'Assomption, an ex-officer of the French Army's crack 11th Shock Parachute Regiment, and a former officer of the Gabonese President Omar Bongo's guard; and Major Mario La Viola, once a non- commissioned officer in the Foreign Legion's 2nd Parachute Regiment. Beneath them were the Antillean Captain Toumi, who became the first black officer in the regular Rhodesian Army as the unit's second-in-command, and \\"Colonel\\" Bob Denard, an infamous French soldier of fortune nicknamed le chien de guerre‚Äî\\"the dog of war\\"., According to an anonymous veteran of the unit, it mostly comprised recently discharged servicemen from the French forces who were having trouble adapting to civilian life. \\"They didn't know how to do anything else, only how to jump with a parachute and obey orders,\\" he explained, \\"and they liked that kind of thing.\\" Others, he said, were members of the political far right who had joined up \\"to kill commies and blacks\\", and some were criminals hoping to escape the attention of the French police. Each signed on for two years. The French-speaking unit was placed in the Rhodesia Regiment (RR) as an \\"independent company\\". The RR already had six of these (made up of Rhodesians), so the Frenchmen became 7 Independent Company. The Rhodesian Army sought to forge a strong esprit de corps among the new recruits, and to this end extended them several sentimental allowances: for example, morale amongst the Frenchmen rose when they were informed that the Rhodesian insignia on their berets would be backed with the French tricolour. In a similar vein, their request for permission to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved. French-speaking men already in the army were attached to the unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction. Some of these were Mauritians, who by virtue of their upbringing spoke both English and French at a native-like level. The company itself, which numbered about 200 men, was assigned headquarters near Salisbury at Cranborne Barracks, the home of the Rhodesian Light Infantry. It was organised in the same manner as a standard Rhodesian independent company, the only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel. Spirits were high during the unit's brief training period as the men enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before heard of such a practice. The first dent to morale came after about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In the eyes of some of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks assigned appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.  Service   First bush trip  alt=A map. See description The francophone company was first deployed out of its barracks in late November 1977, when it was sent to Bindura, about north-east from Salisbury, for a few days in the bush on Operation Hurricane, the Army's operational area which covered Rhodesia's north-east against guerrilla activity. After this passed without major incident, the Frenchmen were despatched to Rusambo, a camp in the Chimanda Tribal Trust Lands, near Rushinga, about north-east from the capital and less than from the border with Mozambique. Most insurgents in this area belonged to ZANLA. A company of men from the Territorial Force was already stationed at Rusambo, advised by a team of intelligence officers. \\"Sticks\\" of four men (three FN FAL riflemen and an MAG gunner) would be sent out into the bush from Rusambo for periods of up to two weeks, equipped with a radio to communicate with the base. Their task while in action was to seek out guerrillas by means of patrolling, ambushing and operating observation and listening posts. Once a group of insurgents was spotted, the stick leader would report their positions; Rusambo would then alert the Army and request a Fireforce. If Fireforce were available, it would arrive and engage the cadres; if not, the stick in the field would have to handle the situation itself. At first, men from 7 Independent Company were sent out in sticks mixed with the Territorials, but problems soon arose regarding proper regimen and the language barrier. When the Frenchmen were then sent out alone, their Land Rovers prominently flying the French flag, the issue of language was resolved, but that of indiscipline remained. Though discretion was paramount if they were to observe enemy movements covertly and effectively, the men of 7 Independent Company were found to have difficulty maintaining this and sometimes made careless mistakes which risked revealing their presence. Moreover, when investigations were made of local kraals, marked tension soon arose between the Frenchmen and the local black population; the soldiers' ignorance of English or Shona made it very difficult for discussions to take place and, according to other Rhodesian units who came into contact with them, the French soldiers took out their frustration on the villagers, often using excessive force in their attempted interrogations. Nyamahoboko Police Station received a report of a 7 Independent Company man raping a young tribeswoman in a dense thicket, but did not act on it. According to one history of the Rhodesia Regiment, \\"it was indicated that the Frenchmen had received instruction that all black people were to be regarded as terrorists\\". The Rhodesian Army quickly deemed the French experiment a failure. It reassigned 7 Independent Company in late November to Marymount Mission, a small settlement to the east of Rusambo where there was a minor police station. The number of patrols they would embark on was reduced. Two of the company's vehicles were ambushed by cadres between Marymount and Rusambo on 6 January 1978, resulting in two men being injured, one fatally so. A week later another truck was surprised on the same bush road, resulting in one death and three serious casualties. The company was brought back from the bush four days later for rest and recuperation (R&R;) in Salisbury.  Strike  During their 15-day rest periods the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in the centre of the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first received their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (‚Ç£7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (‚Ç£1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off. The pay dispute split the unit. About two-thirds went on strike, saying they would not return to action unless the Army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, some of the more contented Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge‚Äîthe Army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment, saying this would contravene Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries‚Äîthe disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.  Second bush trip; dissolution  Starting on 11 February 1978, 7 Independent Company spent half a week at Mount Darwin, where there was a major Army base. The company acquitted themselves well during this time, but one of their number was badly injured in a motor accident. They returned to Rusambo, where the camp was now manned by the British South Africa Police (BSAP), Criminal Investigation Department and Special Branch, guarded by a group of Coloured and Indian-Rhodesian soldiers. On 26 February, the Frenchmen spotted a group of seven cadres indoctrinating tribespeople at a local kraal, and called up Fireforce. The RLI men who arrived killed four of the seven, including one carrying detailed documents. The next day 7 Independent Company observed 11 guerrillas entering another kraal, but this time the Fireforce took too long to arrive. The French company took part in a large contact on 1 March, fighting alongside an RLI Fireforce against 28 cadres; 18 insurgents were killed in this contact without loss for the Rhodesian Army. Soon after this, two sticks from 7 Independent Company were despatched to Marymount, led by a deputy intelligence officer who began sending them out on more regular night patrols. The following months were a disaster for the locally based Rhodesian forces; first one stick fired on another, causing an injury, then a BSAP Land Rover hit a mine, killing two members of the French company. A further Frenchman died in an ambush by insurgents before another friendly fire incident on 19 April 1978 resulted in a fatality. On several occasions during this bush trip the area was \\"frozen\\"; regular army units were confined to their camps while the Selous Scouts operated against the guerrillas. With morale amongst the Frenchmen plummeting, bringing their unit close to collapse, its officers at Rusambo frantically worked to keep it together. The company did not last much longer once back in Salisbury for R&R.; Soon after three of its troopers were placed in detention at Llewellin Barracks, the unit was formally dissolved in May 1978. The only personnel retained by the Army were the interpreters, who were returned to their former units.  Legacy  alt=A map. See description Supported by the French, Rhodesian and South African governments and with Rhodesian logistical assistance, forces led by Denard took part in a coup d'√©tat in the Comoros later in May, toppling Ali Soilih (who Denard had himself put into power three years earlier). The Comoros subsequently became a key location for Rhodesian \\"sanction-busting\\" operations, providing a convenient end-user certificate for clandestine shipments of weapons and equipment bound for Rhodesia in spite of the UN embargo. South Africa, also under a UN arms boycott because of apartheid, received war materiel through the Comoros in a similar fashion. Some 7 Independent Company men became civilians in Rhodesia, which was reconstituted as Zimbabwe in 1980. Two of them, Gervais Henri Alfred Boutanquoi and Simon Marc Chemouil (both former Foreign Legionnaires), were executed in April 1983, despite a late plea from French authorities for clemency, having been found guilty of robbing and murdering Richard Kraft, a Karoi caf√© owner. Witness Mangwende, the Zimbabwean Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement clarifying that the execution was for the murder and unrelated to their earlier \\"service as mercenaries during the time of the Smith regime.\\"  Notes and references   References   Newspaper and journal articles       Bibliography       * Category:Foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian Security Forces Category:Military units and formations established in 1977 Category:Military units and formations of Rhodesia in the Bush War Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1978 Category:Rhodesia Regiment ","title":"7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)"},{"id":"34444954","text":"Coronation Street is a British soap opera first broadcast on 9 December 1960.

In January 1976, Gail began getting mysterious phone calls, although she and her then best mate Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones) thought they were from a secret admirer. However, Gail got a phone call with breathing on the line, making her frightened. She called in the Exchange, and she was all alone when John arrived (pretending to be from the GPO) whilst Tricia was out on a date with Philip Harper (Mark Drewery). Gail started to find John rather creepy, and discovered that he was her stalker after she also discovered he was going to assault her when he told her to get into bed so he can wait for the anonymous phone caller. However, thanks to Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), cops came round to Gail and Tricia's flat, and Gail was soon rescued and John was arrested. Terry Bradshaw Terry Bradshaw, played by Bob Mason, made his first onscreen appearance on in 1976 and departed in December of that year. Terry was introduced as a new employee at Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) and Len Fairclough's (Peter Adamson) builders yard. Show writers then devised a relationship with Gail Potter (Helen Worth), but their romance ended when Gail said that she did not love him. He left in December to join the army. His sister Renee Bradshaw (Madge Hindle) was also introduced into the series.Randall 2010, p.242.Randall 2010, p.129. Terry arrives on the street to take a job at the local builders yard. His sister Renee arrives to visit and notices that the Corner Shop is for sale. As the two catch up on their mother's love life, she approaches Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) to purchase the shop. Renee manages to buy the shop and Terry becomes in need of a home. She lets Terry move into the shop flat and realising that he needs independence, Renee evicts tenants Gail Platt (Helen Worth) and Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones) onto the street. Terry soon becomes attracted to Gail and the pair begin a relationship. But when Gail reveals that she does not love him, he decides to leave and join the army. Renee then blames Gail for her brother's departure. Derek Wilton Derek Wilton, played by Peter Baldwin, made his first onscreen appearance on 23 February 1976 and last appeared on 7 April 1997. Derek was introduced as a love interest of Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow).Little 1998, p.131. Derek spent years playing with Mavis' emotions until they finally married in 1988. They are a \\"comic pair\\" who go through an entire series of misunderstandings and setbacks.Hayward 1991, p.68. Their first attempt at marriage does not develop as they jilt on another on the day. Derek goes on to marry Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher) but eventually realizes that he belongs with Mavis.Hayward 1991, p.69. In 1997, Brian Park decided to axe the character. Derek's exit storyline was devised by Paul Marquess. Baldwin filmed his final scenes on 16 March 1997. The storyline sees Derek become stressed over work, Mavis' birthday and finally an incident with an angry motorist. The stress becomes too much for Derek and he suffers a heart attack and dies. A spokesperson from the show branded the exit as \\"high drama\\" and some of Baldwin's most dramatic material. Gavin Docherty from the Sunday Mail said that Derek was a dopey character. While a writer from the Daily Mirror similarly branded him \\"dozy Derek\\". Wendy Nightingale Wendy Nightingale, played by Susan Tebbs, was introduced as a love interest for Ken Barlow (William Roache). Wendy is a graduate who becomes attracted to Ken. Daran Little, wrote in his book \\"The Coronation Street Story\\", that it took only two home cooked meals for Wendy to be seduced by Ken. But Wendy is already married to Roger Nightingale (Matthew Long). She reveals that she has never been unfaithful but finds married life boring. Ken urges her to leave Roger.Little 1998, p.129. She moves in with Ken and Roger attacks Ken for ruining his marriage. Little said that Wendy and Ken wanted different things. Wendy was well travelled in comparison to Ken who only knew life on Coronation Street. She could not cope with the \\"clutter, noise, smoke, noisiness and openness of the denizens of the street\\". Wendy lived with Ken for five weeks and admitted that she had made a mistake. She returned to Roger who was happy to forgive her and resume their marriage.Little 1998, p.130. Wendy and Ken were Coronation Streets first unmarried cohabiting couple.Egan 2010, pp.138‚Äì139. Roger Nightingale Roger Nightingale, played by Matthew Long, first appeared onscreen in April 1976 and departed on 2 June 1976. Roger is introduced as the husband of Wendy Nightingale (Susan Tebbs) who begins an affair with Ken Barlow (William Roache). She feels that her marriage to Roger has become too boring and Ken convinces her to leave him. When she moves in with Ken, Roger becomes angry and goes to visit the new couple. He ends up attacking Ken and knocking him unconscious. In the book \\"The Coronation Street Story\\", Daran Little wrote that Ken had expected Roger to acknowledge that his marriage was over, but he was not as cooperative as Ken had hoped. When Wendy decides that she has made a mistake, Roger is willing to forgive her. Wendy returns home to Roger and they attempt to rebuild their marriage. Roy Thornley Roy Thornley, portrayed by Sidney Livingstone, was the \\"business associate\\" of Sylvia Matthews (Rosemary Dunham). He began a relationship with nineteen year old Gail Potter (Helen Worth), and took her virginity in the stock room. Gail's then best mate Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) tried to warn her that Roy was married to another woman and had two children with her, but Gail thought that Elsie was acting jealous until she was convinced that she was having an affair with Roy; Gail, disgusted by her own actions, told Roy that they were through. Poor Gail was cited in a messy divorce after Roy's then wife Doreen (Jane Lowe) discovered the affair and Gail was sacked from her job at Sylvia's Separates. Roy tried to make Gail look like the guilty party by having her lie to the court, which she refused to do. However, Gail was soon proven innocent as it was revealed he had an affair with Sylvia. Renee Bradshaw Irene \\"Renee\\" Roberts (n√©e Bradshaw), played by Madge Hindle, made her first onscreen appearance on 10 May 1976 and departed on 30 July 1980. The character began a relationship with widower Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley). The duo married in the episode dated 20 March 1978 despite accusations that Alf was only interested in Renee's wealth. Renee was written out of Coronation Street in 1980. Hindle told Rosemary Long from Evening Times that she was upset to learn her character would be killed off. Renee is involved in a car accident and dies from a ruptured spleen and liver.Randall 2010, p.115. The episode that aired on 30 July 1980 featured Renee's final appearance. Doreen Thornley Doreen Thornley, played by Jane Lowe, was Roy Thornley's (Sidney Livingstone) wife. She went over to 11 Coronation Street to meet nineteen year old Gail Potter (Helen Worth), who unknowingly had an affair with her husband. However, it was Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) who answered the door, and she also tried defending her friend. Gail then broke down at the bottom of the stairs and revealed she didn't know she was having an affair, but Doreen didn't believe her. However, Gail was excused from the divorce proceedings as there was proof she was innocent. Mike Baldwin Michael Vernon \\"Mike\\" Baldwin, played by Johnny Briggs, made his first onscreen appearance on 11 October 1976. Johnny Briggs quit the role in 2005 and Mike departed on 7 April 2006 but made a voice cameo on 14 April 2006. Mike was introduced as a Cockney businessman with an eye for the ladies.

He was born around 1980. He married Maritza Pelegrino Cabrales and had two children. He lived in the Contramaestre area of Santiago de Cuba. Biography He was arrested in July 2011 after his mother in law alerted neighbors and police about a marital dispute involving domestic violence and charged for assault, disrespecting authority and resisting arrest. At some time between August and September 2011, he joined the Cuban Patriotic Union and worked on dissident activity. He participated in a public protest against the government. In November of the year he was sentenced to four years in prison. He was sent to Aguaderas prison in Santiago de Cuba. His wife Maritza Pelegrino attributed her husband‚Äôs political activism to anger over his father‚Äôs death in custody five years earlier, though she could not explain why he joined the movement only last year. According to the Wall Street Journal and other news organizations, Villar started a hunger strike soon after arriving at the prison. He was put in solitary confinement. He was sent to Juan Bruno Zayas Hospital in January 2012 after suffering health problems. The Ladies in White and the CPU both had a vigil to support him. In January 2012 he died. The government claimed he had multiple organ failure, pneumonia, and septic shock. The hunger strike had lasted over 50 days. Amnesty International designated Villar a prisoner of conscience, the announcement coming one day after his death. Representatives from the European Union and the governments of the United States and Spain made statements about his death, criticizing the Cuban government. The Cuban government stated he was not a dissident, but that he had been arrested for violence and injuring his wife at the 2011 protest. The government also stated he had not been on hunger strike.

The brothers write, direct, and produce their films and commercial projects together, and are known for being extremely hands-on with the various stages/aspects of their work. They often write and/or contribute to creative concepts and scripts, assist with pre-production and planning, oversee FX and stunt coordination, and frequently operate cameras on set. Joshua has won multiple awards for film editing, and typically retains \\"final cut\\" control of their films and commercial projects. Background Early life Matt and Joshua Martelli were born in Kalamazoo, Michigan to Frank and Mary Martelli. Their sister Margaret Martelli was born in 1979. The Martelli family lived in a small home south of the downtown Kalamazoo area for most of the brothers early childhood. The Martelli parents worked as medical management professionals at several hospitals in Kalamazoo, while the boys, and their younger sister Maggie attended local public schools. Though the neighborhood was poor, and at times violent, The Martelli Brothers site their experience as \\"young white kids, living in a predominantly black and Asian community\\", as one that bonded them and taught them \\"street smarts\\". Their father Frank enrolled them in the Okinawan Karate Academy, where they studied for several years under Sensei James Thompson, an eighth-degree black belt and forty-five- year veteran of the art. Both boys were encouraged from a young age to develop an appreciation for the arts, including music, theatre, and film. They attended the local YMCA and enrolled in numerous summer classes ranging from hiking, camping, archery, to early computer science courses. They were also given piano and violin lessons. Their mother Mary came from a large family that lived in nearby South Haven area on Lake Michigan, and the boys spent countless weekends and holidays at the lake with family members. In 1984, at the age of ten and twelve, Joshua and Matt moved with their family to San Diego where they remain today. Early education Matt attended and was a member of the first graduating class of Kazoo School, an arts-based early education program in Kalamazoo. Later, in California, both brothers developed an awareness and love of independent filmmaking through their exposure to skateboarding culture. Joshua sites his election to the La Mesa Middle School seventh-grade student body as the \\"Audio/Video Monitor\\" as a pivotal moment in developing an understanding and appreciation for videography and editing. He was tasked with video taping the \\"spirit assemblies\\" and editing them \\"deck- to-deck\\" on VHS tape. The brothers attended Helix High School in La Mesa, California and both enrolled in the Graphic Design ROP program under the direction of Rick Benson and Richard Dirk. It was Richard Dirk, (who later became the Art Director for the Lambesis Agency), that inspired Matt and Joshua to learn more about the history and impact of graphic design. This was also the timeframe when digital technology began to become prominent in the graphic design and printing trades, and the brothers gained their first exposure to Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator on Macintosh computers. Both brothers graduated from Helix High School and enrolled at Palomar College in North San Diego. Professional education The Martelli Brothers continued their graphic design education at Palomar College graphics arts program run by Neil Bruington. In the fall of 1996, Joshua attended the Recording Workshop in Chillicothe, Ohio ‚Äì where he learned studio recording and production techniques. He returned to San Diego and began an internship at Studio West, a prominent recording studio in San Diego. After completing his internship and working as a freelance engineer, Joshua eventually took a position at Network Music as a sound designer and produced over three hundred hours of effects CD's for the Network Music library. Matthew meanwhile, became a professor's assistant to Mr. Bruington, but eventually left Palomar to take positions at several advertising agencies in San Diego. It was his dislike of the \\"typical corporate marketing culture\\" that led him to conceive of the idea of the \\"anti-agency\\" ‚Äì which later became the genesis for forming Mad Media. In 1997 Joshua enrolled in the \\"Recording Arts\\" and \\"Music Industry\\" programs at Chico State University. He was offered a teacher's assistant position under professor Joel Alexander and worked as his assistant while completing both degrees through the fall of 1999. He then returned to San Diego and began working with Matt as the Director of TV/Film Production at Mad Media. Mad Media Marketing and Advertising Agency In the summer of 1995, while attending Palomar College and working for a digital film lab, Matt began to acquire freelance clients in the growing action sports industry. The inaugural ESPN Summer X Games was held that year (1995), and had a profound impact on the action sports community. It suddenly received global attention, and with that attention came opportunity. Recognizing the need to reconcile the difference between the \\"do-it-yourself\\" mentality of the action sports community, and (the often sterile and disconnected atmosphere of many) national advertising agencies, Matt formed Mad Media. The goal of Mad Media was to connect endemic action sports brands with legitimate global marketing opportunities and to also foster non-endemic brand growth by using authentic and genuine messaging. In other words, core action sports companies had an opportunity to reach a far greater customer base, but needed help in dealing with the corporate environment. While at the same time brands like Nike Gatorade, and Snickers became interested in using action sports to market their products, but needed guidance on the approach. Mad Media began executing marketing and advertising campaigns on both ends of that spectrum ‚Äì working with core skateboarding companies like Osiris Shoes and Expedition Skateboards, while at the same time delivering solutions for non-endemic brands like Honda and McDonald's. Mad Media produced a massive advertising campaign for Osiris Shoes for example, that included the very first \\"branded video campaign\\" for any action sports company on the Internet and culminated in a sixteen-episode TV show for FUEL TV. Dubbed \\"The Aftermath Tour\\" ‚Äì it was the largest skateboard tour in history with over fifty U.S. stops and nearly forty stops in Europe. Production Company Mad Media continued to grow throughout the late 1990s, and by the year 2000 Joshua Martelli joined Matt at Mad Media as Director of TV/Film Production, and began to build a professional in-house video and film production department. Mad Media began to routinely produce television commercials, web videos, trade show videos, DVD projects, and interactive branded content for a variety of clients. They also began to explore other markets including music and entertainment, automotive, and the emerging sport of mixed martial arts. Gymkhana The Martelli Brothers are best known for their work directing and producing the most successful viral automotive video franchise in history, Ken Block's Gymkhana series. The wildly popular trilogy of Gymkhana clips, as well as the over twenty ancillary supporting videos created for professional rally racer and former DC Shoes owner Ken Block, have been viewed collectively over 100 million times. The Brothers produced and directed \\"Ken Block Gymkhana Practice\\", \\"Ken Block‚Äôs Gymkhana Two: The Infomercial\\", and \\"Gymkhana THREE, Part 2; Playground; l‚ÄôAutodrome, France\\", after which they concluded their work with Ken and began focusing on work with other athletes.

Japanese migration to Argentina began in 1908 with the arrival of immigrants from Okinawa and Kagoshima.\\"Migration Historical Overview - Argentina \\", Discover Nikkei, 12 September 2007. The first Japanese entered the country via Brazil, and succeeding groups of immigrants tended to reach Argentina through the neighboring nations. In the pre-war years, Japanese Argentines were concentrated in urban small businesses, especially dry cleaning and cafes in Buenos Aires (see :es: Caf√© El Japon√©s), while some worked as domestic servants, factory workers and longshoremen. A minority of Japanese Argentines also engaged in horticulture, floriculture and fishery. There is an important Japanese community in the city of Bel√©n de Escobar where they settled and specialised in floriculture. Between the 1960s and 1970s, more Japanese immigrants arrived in the country. Many were attracted by the economic opportunities in agriculture. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs there are 23,000 nikkei and 11,711 Japanese nationals in Argentina for a total of 34,711 people. History There were about 6,000 ethnic Japanese in Argentina in the late 1930s The Argentine government was friendly with Japan up until the twilight of World War II, when pressure from the United States and the losses by the Axis Powers resulted in loss of diplomatic relations and the Argentine government declaring war against Japan, and therefore causing Japanese institutions in the country to close. In the post-World War II period, most ethnic Japanese decided to stay in Argentina.Masterson, Daniel M. and Sayaka Funada-Classen. The Japanese in Latin America.

The gardens were inaugurated on occasion of a State visit to Argentina by then-Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan. In regions with a substantial Japanese population in Buenos Aires, institutions such as Japanese associations and Japanese language schools were established by early Japanese immigrants. During the United States-Japanese conflict of World War II, Argentina remained neutral until 1943, which limited the impact of war on the lives of Japanese Argentines. However, restrictions included the ban on meetings, Japanese education, newspaper publication, as well as a freeze on Japanese assets‚Äîwhich remained effective between 1944 and 1946.

Denver, CO: Clarity Digital Group, LLC. is nonetheless widely recognized and celebrated throughout the United States. It is primarily celebrated as a recognition of Irish and Irish American culture; celebrations include prominent displays of the color green, eating and drinking, religious observances, and numerous parades. The holiday has been celebrated in what's now the U.S since 1601. According to the National Retail Federation, consumers in the United States spent $4.4 billion on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day in 2016. This amount is down from the $4.8 billion spent in 2014. Early celebrations The world‚Äôs first recorded St Patrick‚Äôs Day celebration was in St. Augustine, Florida, in the year 1600 according to Dr. Michael Franicis's 2017 research. Franicis discovered the first St. Patrick Day Parade was also in St. Augustine in 1601. Both were organized by the Spanish Colony's Irish vicar Ricardo Artur (Richard Arthur). The Charitable Irish Society of Boston organized the first observance of Saint Patrick's Day in the Thirteen Colonies in 1737. Surprisingly, the celebration was not Catholic in nature, Irish immigration to the colonies having been dominated by Protestants. The society's purpose in gathering was simply to honor its homeland, and although they continued to meet annually to coordinate charitable works for the Irish community in Boston, they did not meet on 16 March again until 1794. During the observance of the day, individuals attended a service of worship and a special dinner. New York's first Saint Patrick's Day observance was similar to that of Boston. It was held on 16 March 1762 in the home of John Marshall, an Irish Protestant, and over the next few years informal gatherings by Irish immigrants were the norm. The first recorded parade in New York was by Irish soldiers in the British Army in 1766. The first documented St. Patrick's Day Celebration in Philadelphia was held in 1771. Philadelphia's Friendly Sons of St. Patrick was found to honor St. Patrick and to provide relief to Irish immigrants in the city. Irish Americans have celebrated St. Patrick's Day in Philadelphia since their arrival in America. General George Washington, a member of Philadelphia's Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, actively encouraged Irish American patriots to join the Continental Army. In 1780, while camped in Morristown, NJ, General Washington allowed his troops a holiday on 17 March \\"as an act of solidarity with the Irish in their fight for independence.\\"The original proclamation is available from the Library of Congress: page 1 ‚Äì page 2 This event became known as The Saint Patrick's Day Encampment of 1780.\\"Saint Patrick's Day\\".

Irish aid societies like Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick and the Hibernian Society were created and marched in the parades. Finally when many of these aid societies joined forces in 1848, the parade became not only the largest parade in the United States but one of the largest in the world. The City of Savannah, Georgia, has hosted Saint Patrick's Day celebrations since 1824. It boasts a celebration rivaling that of New York City in size and fervor. Unlike any other cities, Savannah's historic parade is always held on March 17, not on the neighboring weekend. Festivities begin more than a week in advance with communal rituals and commemorative ceremonies, such as the St. Patrick's Parade. Such events were, in fact, the main factors in shaping Irish-American identity as recognized today. In fact, leading up to the 1870s, Irish-American identity in the United States was reworked through the shifting character of the Saint Patrick's Day rituals and features under three separate occasions: Initially, in 1853 when it undertook a \\"spiritual rhetoric\\" notion, then when it became known as a \\"reformulated memory of an Irish past couched in terms of vengeance against Britain\\" to, finally, adopting a \\"sectarian catholic nationalism\\" attitude in the 1870s and 1880s. In fact, ceremonies represent the very \\"junctures at which processes of identity formation surface through representation,\\" which implies that ritual practices represent the molding tools people turn to in order to build a national identity. Furthermore, incorporating \\"the analysis of commemorative rituals\\" becomes a valuable element \\"in the context of broader historical studies\\" as such analysis reveals much about the collective conscience of the Irish-American community. There is a clear gradual shift toward a nationalist attitude in the Irish-American Diaspora which can be detected in the prose of Doheny's commemorative speech in 1853, but the \\"complete ascendency to a nationalist [approach] in Irish identity\\" truly came in the 1870s and 1880s. More important, there were already numerous evidences of a national identity present in the Irish Catholic labouring classes prior to the settlement of an Irish-Catholic community in America. Despite the longing memory of a loved lost Ireland, the main factor that contributed to creating a clear \\"sense of group unity\\" in the Irish-American community really came with the hatred sentiments that were felt towards \\"British oppression and resistance\\". Furthermore, there is a turnover in perspectives towards the causes of the Great famine in the mind of the Irish-American that can be traced: One that varies from a \\"mourning religious view\\", seen in Archbishop Hughes' sermon, to a perspective that shifts the blame towards the British monarchy for its indifference and greed, seen in Cahill's speech in 1860. From that point on, all the following commemorative speeches on the Saint Patrick's Day invoked nationalist themes such as \\"British hatred\\" and \\"heroic struggle\\" and led the way for the creation of a \\"new parade\\" which gained in adherents and absorbed \\"elements of American patriotism and full-fledged nationalism\\". The end result was such that the Irish-American community came to regard itself in the 1870s as a community that defined itself by dual loyalties on one hand, and in another as \\"a unified common organism,\\" which gathered in strength on the basis that they had a common past, \\"not a religious one but one that centered on the common Irish experience of British oppression and suffering\\". In other words, this goes to show that the shifting character of commemorative rituals experienced during the Saint Patrick's parade have influenced the development of American culture in a larger sense, since it contributed to enriching its heritage and making of its Irish-American Diaspora a prideful concept to be celebrated and admired. Modern customs White River in Indianapolis is dyed green in celebration of St. Patrick's Day, 2015 In every year since 1991, March has been proclaimed Irish-American Heritage Month by the US Congress or President due to the date of Saint Patrick's Day. Christian denominations in the United States observing this feast day include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Episcopal Church (United States), and the Roman Catholic Church. Today, Saint Patrick's Day is widely celebrated in America by Irish and non-Irish alike. For most Irish-Americans, this holiday is both religious and festive. It is one of the leading days for consumption of alcohol in the United States, as individuals are allowed to break their Lenten sacrifices for the day in order to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. The consumption of artificially colored green beer is a common celebration. Green Beer Day, for instance, is a tradition among students at Miami University of Ohio dating to 1952; the day has been held on the Thursday before spring break due to the fact that Saint Patrick's Day often occurs during the spring recess. The holiday has been criticized for promoting over-indulgence in alcohol, resulting in drunk driving, property damage, absenteeism, public urination and vomiting, and other ill effects. A notable difference between traditions widely observed in the United States versus those of Ireland is the consumption of corned beef, which is not a traditional Irish dish, but rather one that was adopted by the new immigrants upon their arrival in the 19th Century. Many people choose to wear green colored clothing and items. Traditionally, those who are caught not wearing green are pinched \\"affectionately\\". Seattle and other cities paint the traffic stripe of their parade routes green. Chicago dyes its river green and has done so since 1962 when sewer workers used green dye to check for sewer discharges and had the idea to turn the river green for Saint Patrick's Day. Originally 100 pounds of vegetable dye was used to turn the river green for a whole week but now only forty pounds of dye is used and the color only lasts for several hours. Indianapolis also dyes its main canal green. Savannah dyes its downtown city fountains green. Missouri University of Science and Technology - St Pat's Board Alumni paint 12 city blocks kelly green with mops before the annual parade. In Jamestown, New York, the Chadakoin River (a small tributary that connects Conewango Creek with its source at Chautauqua Lake) is dyed green each year. Columbia, South Carolina, dyes its fountain green in the area known as Five Points (a popular collegiate location near the University of South Carolina). A two-day celebration is held over St Patrick's Day weekend. In Boston, Evacuation Day is celebrated as a public holiday for Suffolk County. While officially commemorating the British departure from Boston, it was made an official holiday after Saint Patrick's Day parades had been occurring in Boston for several decades and is believed to have been popularized because of its falling on the same day as Saint Patrick's Day. Since 1992, the participation of gay and lesbian people in the Boston parade has been disputed and this was the subject of the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case Hurley v. Irish- American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston. The New York parade has experienced a similar controversy since 1991, with boycotts by Mayors Menino and Dinkins. Mayor Bill de Blasio did not attend the 2014 New York City parade, but the ban on gays and lesbians in the New York City parade was announced to have been lifted on September 3rd, 2014. Mayor Walsh did not attend the Boston parade in 2014, but did so in 2015 and 2016. Walsh did not march in the 2017 parade.

The first is the \\"Old Neighborhood Parade,\\" in its 24th year in 2017, which takes place in the city's historic Old First Ward in South Buffalo on the Saturday nearest Saint Patrick's Day (before or after); through 2015, that parade followed a route used by the original Saint Patrick's Day parades in Buffalo, until crowd concerns and drunken rowdiness forced the city to reroute the parade through wider roads in the First Ward. The older, larger \\"Buffalo Saint Patrick's Day Parade\\" (in its 75th consecutive year in 2017) also takes place, usually on the day after the Old Neighborhood parade. That parade runs from Niagara Square along Delaware Avenue to North Street.Mentkowski, Aaron (13 March 2010). City prepares for weekend Saint Patrick's Day parades . WKBW-TV.

Butte, Montana Butte, Montana's mining history brought in a large population of Irish immigrants, to the point that Gaelic was spoken as a common language in the mines and Butte had the highest percentage of Irish population of any city in America, including Boston. Today, the city's population is under 40,000 people, and the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration brings in roughly 30,000 visitors each year, nearly doubling the city's population for the day. Butte has a long history of running a parade through the Uptown District of the city and hosting music at a number of venues, including numerous bars, including one featuring booths created from church pews that had been imported from Dublin and a stone imported from County Clare at the door for visitors to touch. Until 2013 there was no open container law in Butte, and the current ordinance only prohibits open containers between 2:00 am and 8:00 am. The day's events have a reputation for rowdy celebrations. Chicago, Illinois The Chicago River dyed green for Saint Patrick's Day. The Irish comprise one of the largest ethnic groups in Chicago. Although the Irish are present throughout the city, the Beverly, Bridgeport, Morgan Park, and Mount Greenwood neighborhoods have had strong Irish-Catholic populations as does the adjacent suburbs of Blue Island, Alsip, Merrionette Park, and Oak Lawn. People on the south side that are of Irish heritage are known as the \\"South Side Irish,\\" and have long had an influential role in the political and economic scene of the city. They even have their own song that features lines pronouncing pride in Irish-American heritage. The city has many different Saint Patrick's Day celebrations, the most famous being the dyeing of the Chicago River. Each year, the city hosts a parade downtown, which is preceded by the dyeing of the Chicago River. The dyeing of the river involves thousands of people lining the banks of the river and watching as a boat releases dye into the river and turns the river a kelly green color. The Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Union Local 130 has historically sponsored the river dyeing and knows the secret to the dye mix. Another famous celebration is the South Side Irish parade. This is known as more of a celebration by those of Irish heritage rather than a popular activity attended by people of all heritages like the downtown celebration has been known. This parade features traditional Irish dancers, as well as various businesses and organisations from around the city. This parade has been scaled back in recent years as the Saint Patrick's Day committee announced that it was becoming too large for the community to handle. In 2010, the South Side Parade was suspended. Due in part to pressure from community businesses‚Äîparticularly pubs and package goods stores‚Äîas well as local churches on the city, the parade was reinstated in 2012. Of the various St. Patrick's Day parades in Chicago, the South Side parade tries to be family friendly and currently has a zero tolerance policy for public alcohol consumption while attending the parade. The Chicago White Sox baseball team, who play on the South side, are known for their \\"Halfway to Saint Patrick's Day\\" promotion held in September, when the team wears white jerseys with green pinstripes and caps, in lieu of the usual black. The 2020 parade was canceled due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Cleveland, Ohio As Ohio's largest and oldest St. Patrick's Day celebration, Cleveland has honored its Irish heritage with an annual Saint Patrick's Day parade first begun in 1842. The parade always occurs on March 17, no matter the day of the week. Originally held in the city's nearby westside neighborhoods, where a higher percentage of the population was of Irish descent, the parade route today runs along Superior Avenue, downtown, from East 18th Street to Public Square. In recent years, over 15,000 registered participants march in the parade and display their floats in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators. A new record attendance was set in 2012 with over 500,000 people. As part of the parade ceremonies, a Grand Marshal is annually chosen to preside over the procession. This is an honorary title given to a man \\"usually in his senior years, who has contributed significantly to the advancement of the Irish Activities in Cleveland.\\" This recognition has been part of the parade since 1935, while \\"Mother of the Year\\" was established as a distinguished position since 1963. No parade was held in 1862‚Äì65, 1917‚Äì18, 1942‚Äì45 nor 2020. The 2010 Saint Patrick's Day parade in Wappingers Falls, New York.

On September 3, 2014, the organizers of the parade announced a decision to lift the ban on gay groups, saying they preferred to keep the parade non- political and the ban was having the opposite effect. In 2015 OUT@NBCUniversal, an organization of gay employees of NBCUniversal, became the first gay group to march in the parade. Since 1948, a banner reading \\"England get out of Ireland\\" has been carried at the parade as the only political banner allowed. The banner has caused controversy when members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Sinn F√©in leader Mary Lou McDonald were photographed near it. In 1989 Dorothy Hayden Cudahy became the first female Grand Marshal of the New York City Saint Patrick's Day Parade; in 1984 she had become the first woman, as well as the first American-born person, to be elected president of the County Kilkenny Association. The first St. Patrick Parade in NYC was held in 1762 by the constantly increasing Irish community of the city. They say, it was the first recorded St. Patrick's Parade in the world. With the growth of Irish community in the US, parade traditions spread to other American cities. The New York parade is moved to the previous Saturday (16 March) in years where 17 March is a Sunday. The event also has been moved on the rare occasions when, due to Easter's falling on a very early date, 17 March would land in Holy Week. This same scenario arose again in 2008, when Easter fell on 23 March, but the festivities occurred on their normal date and were enjoyed by a record number of viewers.St. Patrick's Day causing Catholic dilemma - CNN.com In many other American cities (such as Philadelphia), the parade is always held on the Sunday before 17 March, regardless of the liturgical calendar. Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed \\"real concerns\\" about the 2020 parade due to COVID-19 and the parade was postponed \\"New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade, the largest such celebration in the world, was postponed late Wednesday over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus\\"; several other cities canceled their parades. The parade can be watched live on NBC Channel 4 New York (WNBC). Besides the parade, there are several other St. Patrick-themed events taking place around the city from stand-up comedy shows to dance parties and concerts. Omaha, Nebraska Omaha's \\"Stockyards\\" opened in 1883 and was once considered the largest livestock market in the world. This led to many ethnic groups' settling in the surrounded area, one of which is Irish. The Irish were the third largest ethnic group in South Omaha in the 20th century. Today the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) Sarpy County Division's St. Patrick's Day Parade has more than 130 entries and lasts more than 90 minutes as it snakes through downtown and the Old Market. Pearl River, New York Pearl River attracts a crowd of 100,000 people, making it the second largest parade in New York state behind the New York City Parade. The parade started in 1963. Peoria, Illinois The St. Patrick Society sponsors a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade and Party on March 17 of each year. The Parade participants march along the designated parade route through downtown Peoria. Awards are presented in the following parade categories: Business Entries, Family Entries, and Organizational Entries. The Parade route ends near the designated site of the family-focused St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Party where families (Irish Clans) meet and enjoy Irish Music, Irish Dance and Irish refreshments.  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  St. Patrick's Day in Pittsburgh is consistently ranked as one of the biggest and best St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the United States. The parade in Pittsburgh dates back to 1869 and continues to draw record numbers of people out to celebrate as over 23,000 march in the parade which attracts almost 500,000 out to party. The city basically shuts down for the day to celebrate as the downtown area and many of the cities bridges and tunnels are filled with patrons heading out for the day's festivities. Pittsburgh also has one of the highest percentage of its population that identifies as Irish (over 13.5%) of any city in the U.S. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania One of the largest in the nation, the St. Patrick's Day parade in Philadelphia is held on the Sunday before every St. Patrick's Day, and began there in 1771.St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade: Philadelphia‚Äôs long-standing celebration of everything Irish, VisitPhilly.com, Philadelphia, PA: Visit Philadelphia, 10 March 2013, Retrieved 15 March 2014. Prior to the first parade, the Irish were already celebrating St. Patrick's Day in Philadelphia. Before the America republic was founded, Irishmen came together in 1771 to pay honor to Ireland's patron as founding members of the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick for the relief of Emigrants from Ireland. George Washington, who has encouraged the many Irish soldiers under his command during the American Revolution to fete St. Patrick's Day, was an honorary member of this society. The designation of March 17 as a day of special observance was a very early Philadelphia custom. In 2013, the parade included about 20,000 participants in more than 150 groups. Participants included marching bands, youth groups, music dance groups, Irish associations, float riders and operators, and flag carriers. After years of being on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Central Philadelphia, the 2017 parade route started at John F. Kennedy Boulevard and 16th Street. It then continues its approach to Philadelphia City Hall, goes down 15th Street around City Hall to approach Market Street. It then goes down Market past Independence Hall and reaches its conclusion at Penn's Landing. The 2020 parade was canceled due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Quad Cities, Illinois and Iowa An Irish population in this cluster of Midwestern cities hosts an St. Patrick's Day parade. It is \\"the only bi-state St. Patrick's Day Parade in the USA\\", according to the St. Patrick's Day Society of the Quad Cities (http://www.stpatsqc.com/GrandParade.htm), crossing the Centennial Bridge from Rock Island, Illinois into Davenport, Iowa. Being so close to Chicago, this parade still gathers around 200,000 annually on its historical parade route. Some travel experts have labeled it as one of the top St. Patrick's Day parades in North America. Much of this is due to the unique nature and small town hospitality you get in the Quad Cities. The whole area combined is a population of around 350,000, with Davenport being the largest city at just under 100,000. Rolla, Missouri Saint Patrick's Board Alumni paint Pine Street green Rolla is home to the Missouri University of Science & Technology (formerly known as University of Missouri-Rolla, and Missouri School of Mines), an engineering college. Inasmuch as Saint Patrick is the patron saint of engineers, the school and town's celebrations start ten days before Saint Patrick's Day, with a downtown parade held the Saturday before Saint Patrick's. A royal court is crowned, and the streets in the city's downtown area are painted solid green. Each year's celebrations are said to be \\"The Best Ever.\\" In 2008, Rolla celebrated its \\"100th Annual Best Ever Saint Patrick's Day 2008\\" celebration. In previous years, a pit of green liquid was made by students as part of the festivities, and named 'Alice'--stepping into Alice was a rite of bravery. In recent years the university faculty has banned the practice out of health concerns. San Diego, California San Diego's 2015 St. Patrick's Day Parade and Festival is the 35th Anniversary of the largest St. Patrick's Day Parade west of the Mississippi. Lasting two hours and featuring over 120 entries, the theme for the day is \\"Celebrating Faith and Freedom\\" as designated by the Irish Congress of Southern California (ICSC). Enjoyed by more than 30,000, the St. Patrick's Day Parade and Festival includes three performance stages, a Kid's Zone, a Celtic Village, dozens of crafts and food booths, two beer gardens hosted by Guinness. Held in Balboa Park, the event was founded by James Foley who had helped organize the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Hartford, Connecticut before he and his wife, Pat, moved to San Diego to open the Blarney Stone Pub. San Francisco, California There has been a Saint Patrick's Day celebration in San Francisco since 1852. San Francisco has always had a large Irish American population and for many decades Irish Americans were the largest ethnic group in San Francisco. However, as of the early 21st century, the largest ethnic group in San Francisco is Chinese Americans and most of the Irish Americans have moved to the suburban parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. Each year, however, Irish from all over the San Francisco Bay Area come into San Francisco to march in or to see the Saint Patrick's Day parade march down Market Street, held the Sunday before Saint Patrick's Day. Numerous people from all ethnic groups can be seen wearing green in San Francisco on Saint Patrick's Day. In March 2019, the United Irish Society nominated recently deceased Sinn F√©in politician Martin McGuinness as honorary marshal in the parade. This was criticized because McGuinness was a former IRA member.  St. Louis, Missouri  The first Saint Patrick's Day celebration in St. Louis took place on March 17, 1820. In 1969, Joseph B. McGlynn Jr. initiated a Saint Patrick's Day Parade in downtown St. Louis. The second year of the parade, the Irish Prime Minister Jack Lynch marched in the parade and called it \\"very impressive.\\" March 2020 marks both the 200th anniversary of Saint Patrick's Celebrations in St. Louis and the 51st Saint Patrick's Day Run and Parade. This is officially to be held on March 14, 2020 with the Grand Marshal being St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson. 2020 Dignataries include Irish Senator Aidan Davitt, Kevin Short Managing Partner and CEO of Clayton Capital Partners, and Brigadier General Brian R. Bisacre, Commander of US Military Police Corps. Savannah, Georgia One of the largest parades is held in Savannah, Georgia. The parade held in Savannah is the largest in Georgia. Many Irish settled in Savannah even in the earliest years since those freed from debtors' prison were invited to join General James Oglethorpe's fledgling colony. There is a Mass at the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist prior to the parade. In the early 1960s, there was an attempt to dye the Savannah River green, but all it produced was an irregular green stripe in the middle of the river. In 2006, the T√°naiste was featured in the parade. The parade travels through Savannah's Historic District. Some confusion exists about the year of the first Saint Patrick's Day parade in Savannah. There is some evidence that a private parade was held by \\"an unidentified group\\" referred to as \\"Fencibles\\" on 17 March 1813. Another source states that the first St. Patrick's Day celebration in Savannah was held in 1818. However, it is generally accepted that the first publicly held Saint Patrick's Day procession was in 1824, organized by the Hibernian Society. The 2012 Parade included over 360 participants making it the largest parade in the history of the City of Savannah. Organizers say that the 2012 crowd was well over a million people. Scranton, Pennsylvania Due to the rich history of Scranton participation in Saint Patrick's Day festivities it is one of the oldest parades in the United States. It has been going on annually since 1862 by the Saint Patrick's Day Parade Association of Lackawanna County and the parade has got attention nationally as being one of the better Saint Patrick's Day parades. The parade route begins on Wyoming Avenue and loops up to Penn Avenue and then Lackawanna Avenue before going back down over Jefferson Avenue to get to Washington Avenue. Since 1962 the St. Patrick‚Äôs Parade Day Association of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, has conducted this nationally acclaimed parade the weekend before the feast of St. Patrick. Seattle, Washington Seattle's Fest√°l Irish Festival Seattle Washington's Saint Patrick's Day Parade, recognized by CNN in 2009 as one of the \\"Five places to get your green on\\" in America, travels along a 1-mile route through the Emerald City's downtown financial and retail core the Saturday before Saint Patrick's Day. Seattle's Saint Patrick's Day Celebration is the largest and oldest in the Northwestern United States. In 2009, some 20,000 spectators and groups from throughout the Northwest turned out for the city's Irish shenanigans. Along with the annual \\"Laying 'O the Green\\" where Irish revellers mark the path of the next morning's procession with a mile-long green stripe, the Seattle parade marks the high-point of Seattle's Irish Week festivities. The week-long civic celebration organized by the city's Irish Heritage Club includes the annual Society of the Friends of Saint Patrick Dinner where a century-old Irish Shillelagh has been passed to the group's new president for 70 years, an Irish Soda Bread Baking Contest, a Mass for Peace that brings together Catholics and others in a Protestant church, and the annual Irish Week Festival, which takes place around Saint Patrick's Day is enormous, including step dancing, food, historical and modern exhibitions, and Irish lessons. Many celebrities of Irish descent visit Seattle during its Saint Patrick's Day Celebration. In 2010 The Right Honorable Desmond Guinness, a direct descendant of Guinness Brewery founder Arthur Guinness, will serve as the parade's grand marshal. In 2009, The Tonight Show's Conan O'Brien made a guest appearance at the annual Mayor's Proclamation Luncheon at local Irish haunt F.X. McCrory's. And in 2008, European Union Ambassador to the US and former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton served as the parade's grand marshal and marched alongside Tom Costello, the mayor of Galway, Seattle's Irish sister city. Spokane, in eastern Washington, also hosts a Saint Patrick's Day Parade. The 2020 parade was canceled due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Syracuse, New York In the city of Syracuse, NY, Saint Patrick's celebrations are traditionally begun with the delivery of green beer to Coleman's Irish Pub on the last Sunday of February. Coleman's is located in the Tipperary Hill section of the city. Tipperary Hill is home to the World-famous \\"Green-on-Top\\" Traffic Light and is historically the Irish section in Syracuse. Saint Patrick's Day is rung in at midnight with the painting of a Shamrock under the Green-Over-Red traffic light. Syracuse boasts the largest Saint Patrick's Day celebration per-capita in the United States with their annual Syracuse Saint Patrick's Parade, founded by Nancy Duffy, an honoured journalist in the Central New York area and an active community leader, and Daniel F. Casey, a local Irishman and businessman. \\"The parade remains a major annual event, typically drawing an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 visitors to downtown Syracuse, as well as 5,000 to 6,000 marchers.\\" Tallahassee, Florida The Tallahassee Irish Society has been hosting an annual Saint Patrick's Day event in Tallahassee since 1999. In 2010, along with the City of Tallahassee, the first annual Saint Patrick's Day parade and Downtown Get Down is being hosted along Adams Street. Utica, New York Washington, D.C. A one-day music festival with a parade called National ShamrockFest has been held in Washington, D.C. each year since 2000 in association with Saint Patrick's Day. Approximately 40,000 people attend each year. The St. Patrick‚Äôs Parade of Washington, D.C. was first held in 1971. The parade route runs down Constitution Avenue from 7th to 17th Streets, N.W and features marching bands, pipe bands, Irish dance schools, military, police, and fire departments, as well as floats and novelty groups. In 2017 and 2018 organizers added security measures intended to counter threats similar to the truck attack in Nice, France, in 2016. These steps included blocking off side-streets with large vehicles, like dump trucks, so terrorists could not drive hi-jacked trucks onto the parade route. On January 10, 2019, organizers announced the extra security steps they felt were necessary made the parade too expensive. Washington's 2019 St. Patrick's Day Parade was cancelled. In 2020, the parade scheduled to take place during the middle of a global pandemic crisis, was postponed.https://wtop.com/holidays/2020/03/st-patricks-day-2020-in-dc-area- what-you-need-to-know/  Worcester, Massachusetts  The Worcester County St. Patrick's Day Parade has been held annually on the Sunday before St. Patrick's Day since 1983. The parade route runs along Park Avenue, beginning at Mill St. and ending at Elm Park. The parade can often see crowds of over 100,000 people. Sports Baseball Although Major League Baseball is still in its preseason spring training phase when Saint Patrick's Day rolls around, some teams celebrate by wearing holiday-themed uniforms. The Cincinnati Reds were the first team to wear Saint Patrick's Day hats in 1978. The Philadelphia Phillies hold the distinction of being the first baseball team to wear green uniforms on Saint Patricks Day. The tradition was started by Phillies pitcher Tug McGraw, who dyed his uniform green the night before March 17, 1981. Along with the Phillies, many other teams have since started wearing Saint Patrick's day themed jerseys, including the Boston Red Sox in 2004, who were also the second team to wear Saint Patrick's Day hats in 1990;\\"The Official Site of The Boston Red Sox: News: Boston Red Sox News\\".

This changed when the league began custom Christmas uniforms in 2011 The practice is not present in college basketball, due to the holiday being largely overshadowed by Championship Week and the subsequent NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, NIT and lesser tournaments. Ice hockey The New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League traditionally wear their throwback uniforms, which include green in the color scheme (green was removed from the Devils' uniforms in 1992), on Saint Patrick's Day and did so for their 2010 and 2012 games against the Pittsburgh Penguins. They also wore them, albeit belatedly, on March 18, 2011 against the Washington Capitals; the Devils played a road game on March 17. Although the Devils, Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild (the last two of which have green in their regular color schemes) are the only U.S.-based teams to wear green on ice, the league has offered a line of holiday-themed gear to its fans in recent years. The Buffalo Sabres also donned green and white Irish-inspired practice jerseys (complete with insular script for the names and captain designations) prior to their March 16, 2014, March 17, 2015 and March 17, 2018 games (the team switched to their regular gold third jerseys prior to the games themselves); the jerseys were auctioned off for charity after each game.Sabres will celebrate St. Patrick's Day with green jersey auction.

Lacrosse The Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League (like the NHL's Sabres, owned by Terry Pegula) introduced a special black-and- green third jersey on their Saint Patrick's Day 2012 game, which was likewise auctioned off for charity. Football The only other major American sport, football, is out of season during the Saint Patrick's Day holiday. The National Football League does sell Saint Patrick's Day merchandise for its teams, however. Rugby The Saint Patrick's Day Test (also known as the Donnybrook Cup) is an international rugby league football match played between the United States and Ireland. The competition was first started in 1995 with Ireland winning the first two tests with the US winning the last 4 in 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The game is usually held on or around 17 March to coincide with Saint Patrick's Day.

He was president of the Moscow Mathematical Society from 1866 to 1885. Early life and education Davidov was born in Courland where his father was a physician and his younger brother Karl Davidov (1838‚Äì1889) became a noted cellist and composer and director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory. In 1839 Davidov was sent to Moscow to attend the school that is now Bauman Moscow State Technical University. In 1841 Davidov enrolled in the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University, where he studied under Nikolai Brashman (1796‚Äì1866). In 1845 he won a gold medal from the university for his paper \\"On Infinitesimal Displacements\\". He was graduated that same year but continued his studies under Brashman. In 1848 he received the title of Master of Mathematics (and later the Demidov Prize from the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences) for his paper \\"The Theory of Equilibrium of Bodies Immersed in a Liquid\\". Teaching career Davidov worked briefly as a mathematics teacher in the Cadet Corps, then in 1850 he started as an Associate Lecturer on the theory of probability in the Physics and Mathematics Department of Moscow University. In 1851 he defended his doctoral dissertation \\"Determination of the Surface of the Fluid Contained in a Vessel\\" and in the same year published his paper \\"Theory of Capillary Phenomena\\". In 1853 Davidov was appointed Extraordinary Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics, a position he retained until 1859, when he was appointed Full Professor in the same department. In 1862 Davidov moved to the chair of pure mathematics and remained in that post until the end of his tenure at the university. In 1864 he created a new course on the theory of functions, which he taught until 1869 (after which it was taught by his student Nikolai Bugaev). Davidov had a great influence on Nikolai Zhukovsky, the \\"Father of Russian Aviation\\", who studied at Moscow University (1864‚Äì1868) and devoted two essays to analysis of Davidov's work. Leadership and organizational roles In 1863 Davidov was elected Dean of the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University, a post he held until 1873. He was again elected to the position in 1878 and held it until 1880. He served as Vice‚ÄìPresident and then President of the Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography, was President of the Imperial Russian Society of Acclimatization of Plants and Animals, and was a member of the Natural History Society. The Moscow Mathematical Society emerged as a scientific circle of mathematics teachers (mostly from the Moscow University), united around a professor of the physics and mathematics faculty of Moscow State University, Nikolai Brashman. The first meeting of the Society was held on September 27, 1864. Brashman was elected first President of the Society and Davidov Vice‚ÄìPresident. In 1866, after the death of Brashman, Davidov was elected the second President and remained in the post until his death almost twenty years later. Pedological work Title page of Davidov's texbook Geometry In 1860 Davidov was appointed Inspector of private educational institutions and community activities and became actively engaged in improving the teaching of mathematics at secondary schools. In 1862 he became a member of the Board of Trustees of the Moscow School District, a post he held for the rest of his life. He participated in the design of mathematics curricula under the aegis of the Pedagogical Department of Primary Education of the Polytechnical Museum, and on his initiative the journal Mathematics Anthology added a section for teachers. Davidov's most lasting contribution to primary and secondary education was his textbooks on mathematics subjects in which he expounded on the mathematical theory in close connection with practical examples, using historical data in examples and incorporating visual aids. These textbooks were well received and went through dozens of reprintings over many decades with little alteration. For instance Upper Secondary School Course on Elementary Geometry went through 39 editions over sixty years and Elementary Algebra 24 editions, the last two under Soviet auspices in 1918 and 1922. Death Davidov retired from Moscow University in June 1885 after thirty years of service. That same year, on December 22, he died and was buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery. After his death, his widow established a prize in his name, awarded for outstanding work in mathematics. Among the winners of this award were the future academician Nikolai Luzin. Davidov's son Alexei Davidov (1867‚Äì1940) became a cellist and composer, then a successful businessman and industrialist and (after the Russian Revolution) an exile in Germany. Works Davidov authored works in mathematics (theory of partial differential equations, theory of definite integrals, application of probability theory to problems of statistics) and mechanics (hydrodynamics, theory of equilibrium of floating bodies, research on links between the theory of capillary phenomena and general equilibrium theory). Works on mathematics includes: *The application of probability theory to statistics. *The application of probability theory to medicine. =\\\\cos m+\\\\sin m\\\\sqrt{-1} |trans-title=An elementary derivation of the formula e^{m\\\\sqrt{-1}}=\\\\cos m+\\\\sin m\\\\sqrt{-1} |journal=Mathematics Anthology (–ú–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫) |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=20‚Äì25 |location=Moscow |publisher=Moscow Mathematical Society |language=Russian}}  * Works on mechanics include: *Design and operation of steam engines. *The greatest number of equilibria of a floating triangular prism. *The theory of equilibrium of bodies immersed in a liquid. * School textbooks include: *Upper Secondary School Course on Elementary Geometry (1863) *Elementary Algebra (1866) *Guide to Arithmetic (1870) *Geometry for the County Schools (1873) *Elementary Trigonometry (1877) *Anthology of Geometric Problems (1888) (Davidov worked on this book at the very end of his life, and it was published after his death.)

The early history of the Polverara breed is unclear, as is its relationship to the Padovana. The Polverara is a larger breed, with a smaller crest and beard. It has been suggested both that it derives from the Padovana, and that the Padovana derives from it. Two sources provide evidence of crested chickens in Europe in Roman times: the two marble statuettes of crested chickens noticed in the Sala degli Animali (\\"animal hall\\") of the Vatican Museums in 1927 by Alessandro Ghigi date from the 1st or 2nd century AD; a chicken skull excavated at West Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire in England shows the typical cerebral hernia of the crested breeds and dates from the 4th century. The first reference to the chickens of Polverara is from Bernardino Scardeone (1478‚Äì1554), who writes of the Saccisica: \\"this area is ... famous for the abundance of chickens of remarkable size, particularly in the village of Polverara\\". Alessandro Tassoni (1565‚Äì1635), in his mock-heroic poem La Secchia Rapita (\\"The Stolen Bucket\\", 1622) speaks of \\"... Polverara, which is the kingdom of cocks\\". A painting by Giovanni Agostino Cassana (1658‚Äì1720) in the Musei Civici degli Eremitani, the city museums of Padova, shows a woman spinning thread in a rural landscape, surrounded by a number of domestic animals, including a crested white hen that closely resembles the Polverara breed. By the late 19th century a decline in the breed, attributed to inter-breeding with other chickens, was already apparent. Despite various attempts by breeders to preserve it, and the institution by the comune of Polverara in 1925 of an annual prize of 300 lire to be awarded to the best breeder, the Polverara chicken declined through most of the 20th century. A rustic breed that adapted poorly to intensive farming, its numbers fell until only seven remained. From the 1980s, new efforts were made to recover and reconstitute it. It was included in the 1996 official standard of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, which is the authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. It is under the protection of the European Community. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1200 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 300 were cocks. Characteristics Two colours are recognised for the Polverara, black and white. The black variety is deep black with strong dark green lights; the legs are a greenish slate colour, and the beak dark with black lines. The white variety is pure white, with willow-green legs and pinkish yellow beak. The skin is white. The crest is small and upward-facing, the comb small and V-shaped. The wattles are small, the ear-lobes of medium size and pure white. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are whitish and weigh at least 50 g. Ring size is 18 mm for cocks, 16 mm for hens. Uses The Polverara is a dual-purpose breed. It is kept in the open as it adapts poorly to captivity, and may roost in trees where available. Cocks easily reach 3 kg in weight. Hens lay at least 150 eggs a year. The meat is darker than in some other breeds, and is delicate and well-flavoured.

Background  Primus was an attorney for the South Carolina affiliate of the ACLU. South Carolina had a policy of sterilizing certain women as a condition of receiving welfare. Primus sent letters to women who had been thus sterilized, offering the legal assistance of the ACLU. The South Carolina's Supreme Court disciplinary board reprimanded Primus for violating South Carolina bar rules against soliciting business. The South Carolina Supreme Court approved the discipline. Primus appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the discipline, ruling that solicitation of prospective litigants by nonprofit organizations that engage in litigation as a form of political expression and political association constitutes expressive and associational conduct entitled to First Amendment protection. The opinion in In re Primus was released the same day as another First Amendment case relating to attorney solicitation Ohralik v.

The series was translated then published under one of the biggest American distributor's (then) for Asian comics, ComicsOne. With the first volume in English being releashed 2002. Whereas the original had been releashed in Hong Kong under Jade Dynasty Publications Limited in 1995. The story is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world, where individuals compete in a gladiatorial event called the \\"Best of The Best Championships\\" to obtain eternal glory. Mega Dragon and Tiger like its name suggests, focuses on the two main characters in the story, Dragon and Tiger.  Prelude  \\"Sixty five million years ago, dinosaurs ruled the world. And then came a massive asteroid many miles across. It struck earth with the destructive force of a million nuclear bombs. The planet was horribly scarred. Massive earthquakes, tidal waves and volcanic eruptions quickly eradicated most of the life on the surface of the world. The reign of dinosaurs came to an abrupt end. Only their fossils remain to us of their existence. Millions of years later, new life slowly gained a foothold on the land. In time... man appeared and claimed the earth for his species\\". Switch to present day. Hong Kong, June 30, 11:00 PM, 1999. \\"The night sky turns swiftly to day as new light blossoms above, ten times brighter than the sun! A swarm of meteorites enter the atmosphere, each the size of a mountain. The doom of 65 million years ago rains down once more. They burn incandescent, super-heated by the atmosphere. Each one a parcel of death... The first one hits Hong Kong with the force of ten nuclear bombs. In seconds, the pearl of the east is vaporized. And all around the world... Humans and animals are exterminated in an instant. Everything natural or man-made suffers the same fate. The resulting earthquakes, tidal waves and volcanic eruptions lay waste to anything in their path. Most of the world falls victim to a biblical firestorm. Some of the meteors were composed of radioactive material. The dust from their explosions darkens the skies with a hot, deadly cloud. And the once blue planet earth becomes a flaming red ball\\". \\"But not all were destroyed in this tragedy. Green dots appeared around the fiery globe. Heaven's curtain extends for one thousand miles, providing impervious protection from the intense firestorm outside. The choking clouds of dust that blanket the earth slowly dissipate over time. Ten years after the apocalypse the clouds that blocked the sun are gone and the blue sky has returned. Heaven's curtain was created by thousands of broadcasting stations, each generating a unified magnetic force field through the use of lasers. When the atmosphere was deemed clear of deadly dust storms, heaven's curtain was opened. The old world was gone for good\\". Switch to land of paradise, 2009. \\"Ten years after the sky fell; this once undeveloped island now boasts a bustling metropolis. A high-tech ark of human civilization, glittering in the sun! Over two million citizens of paradise rejoice madly in the streets. More than two hundred thousand gathered at the pavilion to hear their leader speak\\". \\"The average human being uses six percent of his brain power. Ninety- four percent remains as untapped potential. Edison and Einstein were two of the greatest minds of the 20th century. Both exceeded the six percent mark by a wide margin\\". President bates issues compulsory brain law exams, to test brain power. \\"Citizens dutifully follow the president's decree. New decree. Those over the age of ten who showed less than eight percent brain development were banished from the land of paradise. Bates said only the best of the best deserved citizenship. Over 500 thousand people were forced to leave their homes. These people were sent into the wastelands. But they found it was not deserted. Some had managed to survive the apocalypse. These survivors had formed violent tribes which terrorized anyone who was unable to defend themselves. Some of these wasteland survivors had been mutated by radiation from the space debris. It had warped their minds, as well, turning them into violent killers. Some developed the power to control minds, and used it for evil purposes. But then came the second decree of president bates... Colonization. \\"A regent rules each colony through the use of terror and extremism, the citizens if the wastelands were named the, unworthy ones. Soon the waste-land survivors became slaves. None could stand up against the technological might of the paradise military. They conquered the world in no time. Their only hope for redemption was to enter, the challenge. The winner of these contests was sent to paradise as a contender in the, best of the best championships. Since the year 2010. Fighters from around the world have gathered at paradise stadium on July 1 to compete in the championship. President bates hosts the event with all high-ranking military and dignitaries in attendance. It's the sixth annual, best of the best tournament. After several rounds of competition, two men face off for the top honour. Prelude end.  Characters  Primary characters ; Tiger Yin : Tiger is the main protagonist of the story. He used to live in paradise, but two years before the story begins, at the age of 13 his brain power rapidly decreases to 7% therefore he is removed from the school for gifted and he and his mother are forced away to live in exile in Tibet. Here Tiger lives with his grandfather, Dr. Yin. He learns his family martial arts based on the ancient gods my of which are based on close quarters attacks penetrating the opponents defences. He also is able to relive several past lives that power him up considerably. He later dies horribly after losing the tournament ; Dragon : The other protagonist, formerly friends with Tiger. Unlike his friend he utilises a technological armour style based on titanium. that acts like a cloak/skin when activated. Dragon too is able to relive a past life (one that reveals that Dragon and Tiger were both enemies in the past) Through this he combines his new style with his past lifes ancient Golden Bell style to create even stronger armour. Eventually manages to win through use of new technology, determination and thinking. He then hopes to avenge his friend.  Other Characters  ; William Bates : An obvious play in \\"Bill Gates\\". Drives technology forward is the de facto \\"benevolent\\" prime minister but hides secrets. ; Evil Staff : Evil Staff is a finalist in the sixth annual best of the best tournament. He has long blonde hair, wears a metal mask with horns and wears red clothing. He is equipped with a energized staff which can generate up to 20,000 volts of electricity. His greatest fighting attributes are his demonic speed and his extreme reflexes. His brain power is at 17%. ; Single-Minded Arhat : Single-Minded Arhat or Arhat, is the other finalist in the sixth annual best of the best tournament. He is tall, very muscular man with blonde overgrown facial hair and eyebrows. His combat revolves around the use of his, titanium body. which transforms his skin into a living form of metal armor, thus granting him invulnerability. This is demonstrated in his battle with Evil Staff, where he is hit hundreds of times, yet feels little to no pain. He eventually kills Evil staff, when he activates his level 2 titanium body and uses one of his ultimate techniques, titanium muddle, to rip his opponent to shreds. : After his victory, he is crowned champion and given Tibet to rule over. He is proven to be a cruel, merciless dictator. The one thousand troops under his command, rob and rape with abandon, many citizens are enslaved and he over taxes the rest so he can build his own fortress. : He is obsessed with power. When he discovers Tiger, it excites him and his wishes to engage him in combat to test his own abilities. In his final battle with Tiger he is killed, when Tiger uses one of his special techniques, \\"the thousand limbs of guan yin\\". His brain power stands at 18% when fighting evil staff, when he activates the 3rd level of his titanium body when fighting Tiger it increases to 20%.

Brandenburg was a twin-screw, steel-hulled steamship completed in 1901 by Bremer Vulkan Aktiengesellschaft of Bremen-Vegesack, Germany, for the Norddeutscher Lloyd Line, of Bremen. She was allocated to the United States when the Allied powers parceled out Germany‚Äôs merchant marine after World War I, and was commissioned at Southend-on-Sea, England, on 9 May 1919, Lieutenant Commander Hiram L. Irwin in command. Sailing for Plymouth, England, on 10 May, Brandenburg arrived at her destination on the morning of the 11th, where she provisioned and coaled. Within a week of her arrival, dispatches concerning the ship indicated that the Allied Maritime Transport Council executive had allocated Brandenburg for ‚Äútrooping between England and Northern Russia‚Äù and that repairs to fit her out for that service were estimated to take from three to four weeks. A shortage of enlisted men in the United States, however, prompted Vice Admiral Harry S. Knapp, Commander, U. S. Naval Forces in European Waters, to arrange for the British government take over the ship for the transport duty since the ‚Äútrooping‚Äù would probably last through the summer. Accordingly, Brandenburg sailed for Liverpool on the afternoon of 17 May and arrived there on the afternoon of the 10th. At 1300 on 20 May 1919, Brandenburg was decommissioned and turned over to the Alfred Holt Steamship Company, accredited representatives of the British Admiralty. Brandenburgs former American crew then sailed for the United States in the transport Louisville. Contemporary British mercantile lists carry Brandenburg as being operated by the Holt firm under government auspices at the outset. She remained in the hands of the Holt conglomerate, which included the Ocean Steamship Company (or, more colloquially, the Blue Funnel Line) through 1923. She was renamed Hecuba in 1923 and was broken up for scrap in Italy in December 1924.

In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the USPS was without statutory authority to revoke a periodical's second class permit on the basis of objectionable material that was not obscene..  Background  Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc. was the culmination of a bitter legal battle between Esquire magazine and the USPS that began in 1943. Taking offense to the Varga Girl and other pin-up style imagery, Postmaster General Frank Comerford Walker convened a hearing board in October 1943 to determine whether Esquire contained obscenity. A host of national figures were called in as witnesses to offer their \\"expertise\\" on whether the Varga Girl and other Esquire content was obscene, among them H. L. Mencken and Rev. Peter Marshall. The press had a field-day covering the affair and ridiculing the Postmaster General and his department. When the hearing board ruled 2-1 in favor of Esquire, Postmaster General Walker refused to accept their decision, and revoked Esquire's second- class mailing privileges. Esquire then filed suit in federal district court to enjoin the revocation order. Visiting Judge T. Whitfield Davidson ruled in favor of the Post Office in Esquire vs. Walker. Esquire appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals where Judge Thurman Arnold reversed the decision. Postmaster General Frank Walker (who was succeeded by Robert Hannegan in June 1945) appealed the case to the Supreme Court. In 1946 the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in favor of Esquire.  Opinion of the Court  Justice William O. Douglas wrote the opinion for the court: > To uphold the order of revocation would, therefore, grant the Postmaster > General a power of censorship. Such a power is so abhorrent to our > traditions that a purpose to grant it should not be easily inferred ... To > withdraw the second-class rate from this publication today because its > contents seemed to one official not good for the public would sanction > withdrawal of the second-class rate tomorrow from another periodical whose > social or economic views seemed harmful to another official ... Congress has > left the Postmaster General with no power to prescribe standards for the > literature or the art which a mailable periodical disseminates.Hannegan, 327 > U.S. at 151-58. The Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc. decision had important social implications for postwar society. The decision sanctioned the pin-up as a socially acceptable cultural symbol, and helped spur an unprecedented increase in pornographic magazines during the 1950s.

Pintrest photo album saved by Dziki Czos (April 22, 2016).Adventure Time #9. October 2012. Published by KaBOOM!, a division of Boom Entertainment, Inc., Los Angeles, California, USA. is a fictional character in the American animated television series Adventure Time, created by Pendleton Ward. She is voiced by Hynden Walch. Princess Bubblegum is a \\"Gum Golem\\", a being composed of both human and candy DNA, and rules the Candy Kingdom, which is inhabited by other \\"Candy People\\". She is good friends with the series' protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, first appearing with them in Ward's 2008 pilot. Character Personality Bubblegum is typically very kind and compassionate, having a strong sense of justice, though she shows a dark side when provoked. She is highly intelligent, being responsible for the creation of the Candy People as well as various devices including a miniature time machine. She is fluent in German and Korean, using the latter language to communicate with her friend Lady Rainicorn. Bubblegum is skeptical of magic, refusing to acknowledge it as anything other than ‚Äúscientific principles presented like mystical hoodoo‚Äù. Bubblegum is highly protective of the Candy People and cares deeply for their safety, but is secretly strained by the pressures of ruling and expresses a desire for freedom. Following a near-death experience at the end of the second season, she starts to isolate herself and becomes overprotective of the Candy People, even exhibiting authoritarian tendencies temporarily in the fifth season. At the end of the sixth season, Bubblegum is deposed as ruler following an election, where she realizes she has made the Candy People too unintelligent. Following the miniseries Stakes, Bubblegum is reinstated as ruler and becomes less overprotective. Characteristics Bubblegum has light pink skin and long magenta \\"hair\\", which is actually bubblegum. Her usual outfit is a puffy-sleeved pink gown with purple trim. Among many other outfits, she often wears a lab coat during science experiments. Being made of candy, Bubblegum is able to deform and reform her own biomass, through which she can regain lost body parts and fluctuate her biological age. Princess Bubblegum's birthday is on October 16. She usually appears bodily to be eighteen years old, though her actual age is given as 827; she was born hundreds of years prior to the events of the series from a gum-like ooze, the \\"Mother Gum\\". Bubblegum temporarily becomes thirteen years old in the third season due to losing too much biomass after being attacked by the Lich. In the seventh season, Bubblegum discovers that she is an incarnation of the \\"Candy Elemental\\", the living embodiment of candy as one of the Adventure Time universe's four classical elements (fire, water, candy, and slime). As the Elemental, she can materialize various quantities of candy through her hands and communicate with past incarnations of the Elemental. When Bubblegum's elemental powers consume her in the miniseries Elements, she becomes psychically connected to all candy in the universe, and can transform others into candy, upon which they lose memory of their life prior to their transformation. Relationships Besides Lady Rainicorn, Bubblegum is very good friends with Finn and Jake. In early episodes and the pilot, Finn has a crush on Bubblegum, often saving her from Ice King, though he eventually realizes she is too old for him. Finn still has feelings for Bubblegum afterward, as he becomes angry when she tries to intervene in his relationship with Flame Princess, believing her to be jealous when she actually fears for his safety as Flame Princess is highly unstable. Ice King has a strange fascination with Bubblegum due to her being a princess; it is revealed that she reminds him of his fianc√©e Betty, whom he often referred to as his \\"princess\\". Bubblegum has a strong bond with Marceline, whom she refers to as her \\"best friend\\" in Stakes. Though they are initially shown as hostile toward each other, they are implied to have a past romantic relationship in the third season. In the final episode, they share a kiss together after Marceline saves Bubblegum from GOLB, and are shown in a relationship in the epilogue. Bubblegum has a younger brother named Neddy, who is a \\"candy dragon\\" that was born alongside her in the Mother Gum. Neddy lives underneath the Candy Kingdom where Bubblegum keeps him isolated, as he is very easily frightened. Bubblegum is highly protective of Neddy as she is with the other Candy People, claiming that Neddy is merely \\"built different... we just need to respect it\\". Bubblegum's first creation was her \\"Uncle\\" Gumbald, whom she created after feeling lonely and desiring a companion. Gumbald originated the idea of a Candy Kingdom but became tyrannical, forcing Bubblegum to turn him into an average, unintelligent Candy Person using \\"dum-dum juice\\". Bubblegum also created an \\"Aunt\\" Lolly and a \\"Cousin\\" Chicle, who were also turned into Candy People for assisting Gumbald. Near the end of the series, Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle are returned to their prior forms and seek revenge on Bubblegum, though Gumbald and Chicle are turned back into Candy People. Lolly repents and reconciles with Bubblegum, helping her look after Neddy as seen in the epilogue. Bubblegum's other creations include the Earl of Lemongrab and two \\"candy sphinxes\\" named Goliad and Stormo. A male counterpart of Bubblegum, Prince Gumball, exists in Ice King's \\"Fionna and Cake\\" stories. Where Princess Bubblegum enjoys science and talks to Lady Rainicorn in Korean, Prince Gumball is fond of baking and has a friend named Lord Monochromicorn with whom he communicates using Morse code. Prince Gumball is voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. Reception Bubblegum's relationship with Marceline has generated some controversy. Olivia Olson, who provides the voice of Marceline, once Tweeted that Ward told her the two \\"dated\\", though she later Tweeted that \\"I like to make things up at panels. Ya'll take my stories way too seriously\\". A video produced by Frederator Studios to offer a \\"recap\\" of Adventure Time further implied that Bubblegum and Marceline were in a relationship; the video was removed from YouTube, inciting further controversy. Bitch magazine saw Frederator's action as detrimental toward the acceptance of homosexuality in children's television. Executive producer Fred Seibert later admitted that \\"we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far\\" in making the video, which was meant to provide an outlet for input from fans. Ward admitted he did not \\"really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo.\\" See also * List of Adventure Time characters References Bubblegum Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Bubblegum Category:Female characters in animated series Category:Fictional bisexual females Category:LGBT characters in animated series Category:LGBT characters in comics ","title":"Princess Bubblegum"},{"id":"34445484","text":"Baggett v.

Background  Washington state passed two laws which required teachers and employees to swear oaths as a condition of employment. A 1931 law required them to swear allegiance to the United States.

The episode aired on NBC in the United States on February 9, 2012. It was written by Amelie Gillette and was directed by David Rogers. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) returns from her maternity leave, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) must select employees to accompany Dwight to Tallahassee, Florida after he is sent on an assignment. Meanwhile, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) receives a beanie from warehouse worker Val (Ameenah Kaplan) and is unsure if she intended it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship. \\"Special Project\\" introduced a six-episode arc which featured several of the office workers working on a special project for Sabre in Tallahassee. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with many reviewers looking forward to the \\"special projects\\" storyline. The ending scene featuring Cathy's phone conversation about Jim and Pam's marriage has also received significant attention from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Special Project\\" drew 5.16 million viewers and received a 2.5 rating/6% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a three-tenths drop in ratings from the previous episode, \\"Jury Duty\\", and becoming one of the lowest-rated episodes of the series. Despite this, it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Just as Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) maternity leave ends and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) also returns, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is assigned with the task of forming a team and traveling down to Florida for three weeks to help Sabre launch a chain of retail stores. He and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) must select employees to accompany Dwight to Tallahassee. At first Dwight chooses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), Angela, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), for varying reasons, but Andy refuses to let so many essential employees leave for three weeks. While letting Dwight have Darryl and Phyllis, Andy chooses Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to join the team instead, upsetting Dwight. Dwight then prematurely announces the picks and deliberately riles up the employees, hoping to change the team. Andy decides to let people convince him why they should go before making his final decision, further stressing Dwight. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) receives a text from Robert California (James Spader), which seems to invite him on the trip to Tallahassee. After unsuccessfully trying to back out via text, Jim and Pam both agree Jim should just go. During Jim's request session with Andy and Dwight, Jim shows the texts from California, shocking both Andy and Dwight, making it all but official that Jim will be going to Tallahassee. The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight. At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds using various Florida stereotypes, at one point filling the conference room with mosquitoes, but after realizing they all have excellent ideas for the project, he is content with the team. Erin expresses frustration that Andy is still with Jessica. After Andy and Dwight jointly choose her for the project team, she admits in a talking head that she is not going to return to Scranton once she arrives in Florida. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Cathy also has ulterior motives for the trip, intending to seduce Jim while the two are in Florida together, stating, during a cell phone conversation to a friend, that \\"... Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee. What else is there to do?\\" Darryl discovers warehouse worker Val (Ameenah Kaplan) has knitted him a beanie. Unsure if she intended it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship, Darryl decides to find out by giving her a Valentine's Day gift of an expensive pair of cashmere ladies' gloves with a romantic card. Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie for everyone in the warehouse, an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off to warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch), who is moved by the gift, and later gives him personal coupons for repayment. Darryl is further disappointed when a man named Brandon calls asking for the address of the warehouse to send flowers to his girlfriend Val. He is intrigued, however, when she says the flowers were from her mother, despite him pointing out the caller had had a deep voice and gone by the name Brandon. Darryl decides Val's gift was \\"a love beanie\\". Production The episode was written by story editor Amelie Gillette, her second writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by series producer and editor David Rogers, his fifth directing credit for the series. The episode also marks the eighth appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She makes an appearance in the episode, despite the fact that Pam arrives back in work, which is referenced in the episode by Meredith Palmer. The episode introduced a six-episode arc which featured several of the office workers working on a special project for Sabre in Tallahassee, Florida. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include more clips of Dwight forming his group, Cathy mentioning a former boyfriend to the camera, and more clips of the office workers attempting to join the special projects group. Cultural references Stanley says that he's the only one in the office who watches the television series, Burn Notice. Dwight says after finishing work on the special project in Florida, they will be able to go visit Cape Canaveral and go sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan. While attempting to convince his group not to go to Florida, pictures of Casey Anthony, Katherine Harris, Brooke Hogan and Tony Montana are used.

The episode was viewed by an estimated 5.16 million viewers and received a 2.5 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a three-tenths drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Jury Duty\\".

After DVR usage was taken into account, the episode increased its viewership by 64%, being viewed by a total of 7.842 million viewers. Critical response Rainn Wilson's performance received mixed reviews from critics with The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticizing it for being too \\"broad\\". \\"Special Project\\" received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many looking forward to the \\"special projects\\" plotline. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised the episode and the introduction of the special projects plotline, comparing it to the third season arc featuring Jim in Stamford, Connecticut, and the \\"Michael Scott Paper Company\\" arc from the fifth season. He praised the episode for feeling \\"like a big answer to many of the issues that have plagued the show so far this season\\", specifically pointing to Dwight's meta-commentary on Cathy's \\"lack of personality\\". He moreover wrote that he was looking forward to the rest of the season and the change in dynamic. Despite this, he criticized Dwight's role in the episode, comparing his orientation to Michael's conference room lectures and wrote he had a \\"distaste\\" for the broader moments for the character. He ultimately gave the episode an A-, his highest grade for an eighth-season episode. New York writer Michael Tedder gave the episode a positive review for avoiding the \\"cutesy\\" moments that were featured in the first half of the season. He praised several of the cast members' performances in the episode, including Ellie Kemper and Mark Proksch. He also complimented the sub-plot featuring Darryl and Val, but wrote that the producers should just get the two together, because \\"Not every ongoing plotline needs to last all season\\". IGN writer Cindy White wrote a positive review for the episode for allowing the \\"less prominent characters of the ensemble\\" to get some lines in the episode, specifically mentioning Stanley and Ryan. She also complimented the Darryl-Val subplot, writing that they're one of the few romantic pairings on the show that she's \\"rooting\\" for. She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10, calling it \\"impressive\\". However, not all reviews were positive. Lizzie Fhur of Buzz Sugar wrote that while the \\"special projects\\" storyline has potential, \\"this week just kind of landed flat for me\\". Brian Marder of Hollywood called the episode a \\"giant step back\\", especially following the previous episode which he called \\"promising\\". He wrote that the jokes and story of the episode went \\"nowhere\\" and he criticized the episode for its loud, \\"laugh-track-worthy\\" jokes compared to the early seasons of the series that featured more subtle humor. Despite the mostly negative review, he wrote that he hoped the episode would lead to a better storyline in the following episodes. The ending scene featuring Cathy's phone conversation about Jim and Pam's marriage has also received significant attention. Cindy White criticized the suggestion that Cathy will break Jim and Pam, calling it a \\"cheap plow\\" and that if Cathy and Jim would have an affair, it would cause \\"serious damage to [Jim's] character\\", while Myles McNutt felt it would allow Cathy to become an actual character in the series.

The episode was written by Ethan Gross, while being directed by David Solomon. Plot Olivia (Anna Torv) contemplates the warning from the bald man‚Äîknown to the viewer as the Observer September (Michael Cerveris)‚Äîabout how she appears destined to be killed. Broyles (Lance Reddick) cautions her about taking unnecessary risks until they learn more about this man, but Olivia agrees to continue to perform her job. A man is killed when a girder from a nearby construction site accidentally falls and impales him. The Fringe division is called in when they find the man was given a piece of paper from a young girl (Alexis Raich) moments before the accident, a drawing of his death in perfect detail. The Fringe team uses nearby security footage to determine the identity of the girl, Emily Mallum. They approach her father, Jim (Currie Graham), who initially lies about Emily, but eventually lets them in. Jim is aware that Emily has a gift for seeing the future, and he has been moving his family across country and changing their identities, trying to stay ahead of people who he believes are agents of Massive Dynamic using black panel vans, trying to take Emily and experiment on her ability to see the future. Jim refuses to allow the Fringe team to help out any further, but Olivia leaves him her card. Later, Olivia talks to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) about Emily, who admits that Massive Dynamic has an interest in the girl, but only to study her abilities. Olivia begins to compare Emily's case to her own as a child in the Cortexiphan experiments, but is interrupted by a call from Emily, who wants to meet privately. At a park bench near a lake, Emily shows Olivia her latest picture that she drew after encountering a man on a bus but wasn't able to hand to him: a pile of dead bodies. She explains her \\"gift\\", that when she is near someone that will die she gets flashes of their death in her mind. These visions have never failed to come to fruition, and she worries for the apparent death toll in this latest drawing. The drawing does not give enough information to guess where it may occur, so Olivia takes Emily to Walter's (John Noble) lab, where Walter believes that Emily's brain is picking up on the vibrations of traumatic events as they flow backwards in time. After obtaining Jim's approval, they hook Emily up to Walter's equipment, to allow her to explore her own mind under hypnosis. Within her vision of the forthcoming event, Emily recognizes that it is a result of an explosion, and enough of a sign to pinpoint the location, a nearby courthouse. The team is also able to identify the man aboard the bus, Albert Duncan. They conclude Duncan is about to blow up the courthouse. The team races there to discover Duncan targeting a judge that ruled against him in a child custody case, ruining his life. With Peter's (Joshua Jackson) help, the radio-controlled bomb is disabled, but Duncan further reveals he has a bomb strapped to himself. Olivia is able to talk him out of detonating it, saving everyone's lives, and taking Duncan into custody. As they close the case, Olivia contacts Emily to pass on thanks, but gets Jim instead. Jim finds Emily missing from her bedroom, and the Fringe team sets off to follow a black van that Jim had spotted believing Emily was kidnapped; it turns out this was only a dry cleaning delivery van. Olivia quickly realizes where Emily has gone and directs Jim to meet her at the park bench by the lake. Emily is there in the bitter cold, and Jim sits down next to her coaxing her to get help, but she refuses. Olivia spots Emily's most recent drawing, of her and her father on the bench with her watching, and realizes that Emily is dying. Jim holds onto Emily as she dies from an overload of electrical activity in her brain caused by her ability. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter continue to bond as they work to understand the principles of the Machine to allow Peter to return to his original timeline. Peter later explains to Olivia who the Observers are and their ability to be aware of the consequences of time. That evening, Nina drops by to visit Olivia, and upon hearing that she is still suffering from migraines at night, promises to send her new medicine that may help her. At exactly the same moment, outside of her home, an Observer is watching.

The alternate Agent Farnsworth grants herself permission to cross over to the prime universe in order to visit Astrid and learn about her past after her father's death. In the investigation, a former MIT professor uses his talents, along with borrowed technology, to intercede in the lives of those destined for a life of suffering. Meanwhile, the Observers monitor the entire affair and learn of the failed intervention of one of their own. The episode was co-written by Akiva Goldsman, J.H. Wyman, and Jeff Pinkner. Charles Beeson directed the hour. It received generally positive reviews, with the performance of Jasika Nicole, depiction of autism from the alternate incarnation of the character, which Nicole based on her sister, the development of Astrid which was considered long over-due and the interactions between Walter and Fauxlivia. Plot The parallel universe's Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) recently had her father die; as she has Asperger syndrome, she concludes the only person she can talk to is herself, and discreetly crosses over through the Machine Room bridge to meet with the prime universe's version of Astrid (Nicole). After a bit of initial surprise and discovery, the parallel version of Astrid explains that her father was aloof and distant to her special needs, and the prime Astrid admits the same, but implies she found a way to deal with them. When parallel Astrid's disappearance is discovered in the parallel universe, Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) sends Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) across to escort her back. When she arrives, Walter (John Noble) is initially bitter about her arrival, recalling her deceitful tactics she used to earn his trust when she was sent to take the prime Olivia's (Torv) place, but he soon warms up to her, and they share a number of questionably pleasant memories during that time. Meanwhile, the prime universe's Fringe team learns of the death of a man who had just learned that he only had a short time to live due to cancer; his death was not natural, however, instead caused by a toxic aerosol spray that leaves him with bloody tears, giving him the appearance of the \\"Tears of Ra\\". Walter identifies the poison as something that could not have been developed by technology in either universe. They are alerted to another man, Jared (G. Michael Grey), who had just survived a car accident that left him paraplegic. Jared explains about a man that claimed he could see past, present, and future, and wanted to save Jared from suffering as a paraplegic by killing him before the accident; instead Jared ran, scared, into the accident himself. With information from Jared and help from the parallel version of Astrid, they recognize their man as a TSA agent at the airport who had cleared all his victims prior. When Peter and Olivia approach him, he evades capture. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) learn their murderer is Neil (Chin Han), a former professor from MIT. A colleague there explains that, after spending a period of time at his lake house, Neil became fascinated by a series of high-level equations, ignoring work duties to study them and eventually abandoning his position. The two become concerned when they learn the lake house was on Reiden Lake, where, in this timeline, Walter had unsuccessfully tried to bring the parallel universe's version of Peter back over, and where Peter had reappeared within this timeline. At the lake house, they learn that Neil survived a car accident as a child that took his father and brother. Realizing Neil's mother is still alive, the two descend on her home, and find Neil there. Neil explains to his mother that, shortly after the accident, he had overheard her claiming that God took the wrong son, and has been trying to act as a savior to prove her wrong. As the Fringe team bursts into the home, Neil recounts that angels don't belong on earth, and fires a gunshot towards Olivia, upon which she returns fire and kills him. As the scene is cleared up, Olivia realizes that Neil had purposely missed her to get her to kill him, since he would not have become an angel if he had taken his own life. The parallel versions of Astrid and Olivia soon return to their universe after warm goodbyes; the prime universe's Astrid is shown returning home into the welcoming arms of her father (Blu Mankuma), despite what she had told her doppelganger. At Neil's mother's home, two Observers, including December, locate Neil's safe and find a glowing blue tube, containing the aerosol formula. They recognize the tube as belonging to September, apparently lost when he had unsuccessfully tried to save Peter at Reiden Lake in 1985. December learns that Peter has reappeared in this timeline. Production \\"Making Angels\\" was co-written by co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner, J.H. Wyman, and consulting producer Akiva Goldsman. Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson directed the installment, his fourth Fringe directing credit (his other episodes being \\"Jacksonville\\", \\"The Firefly\\", and \\"Stowaway\\"). Reception Ratings \\"Making Angels\\" was first broadcast on February 3, 2012 in the United States on Fox. An estimated 3.20 million viewers watched the episode, marking a slight decrease from the previous episode, but still remained one of the most viewed episodes of the season. Reviews The episode received generally positive reviews, with many praising Nicole's performance and the focus on Astrid's character, which was deemed long overdue.http://www.tv.com/news/fringe-save-the-best-for-astrid-27760/ Noel Murray of The A.V.

He wondered how some of the events mentioned fit into the larger story arc, but found that the episode \\"offers its own refutation for those who get frustrated trying to figure out what's what.\\" SFX reviewer Richard Edwards awarded the episode four and a half out of five stars, calling it \\"a cracker of an episode.\\" He was positive toward the character-driven developments of Astrid and Walter, and although the concept of seeing the future had been used recently, he found the case of the week to still be interesting. Writing for The Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson stated that the episode \\"practically pandered to everything I love this week,\\" but felt that it did not quite work because Astrid and Neil's stories were disconnected although \\"enthralling.\\" He preferred the Astrid story, writing that although Neil's story \\"started out strong,\\" it faltered by the end. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised the drama and described the race to find Neil as \\"compelling.\\" He also enjoyed the impact that the other Astrid and Fauxlivia made on the prime universe characters. In a 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the sixth best episode of the entire series, highlighting its use of Astrid and Jasika Nicole‚Äôs performance as \\"note- perfect.\\" References External links * \\"Making Angels\\" at Fox.com  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Akiva Goldsman ","title":"Making Angels"},{"id":"34445519","text":"\\"Welcome to Westfield\\" is the twelfth episode of the fourth season of the Fox science-fiction drama television series Fringe, and the series' 77th episode overall. The episode was written by J. R. Orci and Graham Roland, while being directed by David Straiton. Plot Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) has been trying to understand and use the Machine to return to his original timeline, with Walter (John Noble) having become more open and willing to explore the nature and mechanics of the device. Olivia (Anna Torv) is curious about the state of her relationship with Peter in his original timeline and tries to learn more from Peter. Several drivers find their cars malfunctioning along a stretch of highway in Vermont, followed shortly by a crash of an airliner nearby. The Fringe team is called to investigate, Walter coming along for the first time in years. Walter identifies that the cars and plane were influenced by a strong electromagnetic field. Olivia, Peter and Walter travel to a nearby small town, Westfield, to gather evidence. While stopping at a diner for a bite to eat, the proprietor, acting delusionally, turns on the group and they are forced to kill him. They find other bodies that, like the dead cook, exhibit double irises or a second set of teeth. They free a survivor, Cliff (Tim Kelleher), from the back room. As Walter tends to Cliff's wounds Olivia and Peter realize the town is practically deserted and communication with the outside impossible. They find themselves unable to leave the town when they try to drive Cliff to a hospital: leaving on the main road brings them right back into the town. As Cliff recovers he explains that three days ago the population started suffering from a delusional outbreak, acting as if they had lived a second life and killing friends and loved ones as if they didn't know them. They regroup with survivors at the local high school where Walter takes blood samples to try to identify the cause. A survivor kills herself after coming down with symptoms of the malaise and Walter realizes that those affected have twice the normal count of human DNA and have a higher rate of mitosis which is creating duplicate body organs. Walter concludes that the infected have somehow merged with their doppelgangers from the parallel universe, giving them this novel biology and a new set of memories; the few who remain unaffected, like Cliff, likely did not have a doppelganger in the parallel universe's version of Westfield. Due to the inability to leave town, Walter surmises that someone has merged the two realities into a single location, an experiment that he and William Bell had performed on a much smaller scale years ago when studying the parallel universe. Olivia, who had earlier felt the onset of a second set of memories and other delusional effects that Cliff described, is relieved to hear from Walter that her biology is normal. Suddenly, the town is struck by seismic effects, and from the school's roof, the Fringe team and the survivors witness trees and buildings shimmer out of existence. Walter reveals this as the after-effect of the universes being merged, the collapse and destruction of both merged masses. He and Peter quickly rationalize that the center of the merged town would act like the eye of a storm, and locate this point, a bicycle shop. The survivors race ahead of the collapsing field and make it to the store in time. After the collapse, all of Westfield has vanished, but for a few buildings around the bicycle shop, leaving barren wasteland for miles. The remainder of Fringe division is able to reach the survivors and help them; Olivia learns that they found several strange devices equipped with amphilicite planted around the perimeter of Westfield and believes them to have been set by David Robert Jones for some nefarious purpose. On his way home, Peter goes to visit Olivia. She has ordered out for them and greets him with a kiss, things that only the Olivia from the primary timeline would have done. Production \\"Welcome to Westfield\\" was co-written by co-producer Graham Roland and consulting producer J. R. Orci. House M.D. veteran David Straiton directed the installment, his third credit on the series (his other two being, \\"Amber 31422\\" and \\"Peter\\"). In a June 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble called the episode one of his favorites of the series because \\"it was the first time that really the old team had got back together again ‚Äî Walter and Olivia (Anna Torv) and Peter (Joshua Jackson). It was a very interesting story for all sorts of reasons.\\" Cultural references At one point, Walter compares the town of Westfield to the eponymous town in the musical Brigadoon. Reviewers noted that the episode appeared to borrow several elements of other science- fiction and drama shows, including The Twilight Zone, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The X-Files, The Prisoner and The Walking Dead. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the use of \\"rhubarb pie\\" was an allusion to the industry term \\"rhubarb\\" used to describe the shocked murmuring of a crowd, and used here to mimic the anticipated reaction of the show's watchers at the various reveals. Reception Ratings The episode was watched by an estimated 3.05 million viewers. It earned 1.1 ratings share in adults 18-49, down a tenth from the previous episode, \\"Making Angels\\". Fringe finished fourth in the hour, behind CBS' CSI: NY, NBC's Grimm, and ABC's What Would You Do?. Reviews Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"Welcome to Westfield\\" the sixth best episode of the series, calling it \\"the standout installment of Fringes admirably ambitious but ultimately frustrating Rebootlandia fourth season, [which] felt like old school Fringe, and more, evocative of high-grade Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and The Walking Dead.\\" References External links * \\"Welcome to Westfield\\" at Fox.com  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes ","title":"Welcome to Westfield"},{"id":"34445530","text":"Dark December is a 1960 post-holocaust novel by Alfred Coppel. Plot A nuclear war which left the US and the entire world devastated is over at last. The war-weary Major Kenneth Gavin is discharged. Leaving the enclave where the remnants of the US Army keep some semblance of order, he sets off on a quest into the wilderness which had been California, on a quest to reach his home - though having no idea if anything was left of it - and trying to make something of the life left to him in this harsh new world. He crosses areas where every living thing had been vaporized, countryside where anthrax and radiation sickness are killing off the survivors, where gangs of homeless kids had reverted to savagery and would murder for a pair of shoes and where women had slipped to the last stages of degradation. A crucial point in the book is the moment when Gavin finds a Soviet Air Force pilot who had parachuted onto American soil. With no organized government left to establish Prisoner of War Camps and uphold the Geneva Conventions, the pilot was captured by boys who are constantly torturing and degrading him, venting upon him their anger and frustration. Gavin's determination to save the Russian brings him into a head- on confrontation with another officer roaming the ruins - Major Collingwood, a fanatic and ruthless militarist and nationalist determined to rebuild the same order which had led to the devastating war. Eventually, Gavin wins his struggle with Collingwood - a moral as well as material victory - and in the cautiously optimistic ending, finds a new love and the possibility of making a new start. Themes As noted by Edward Cook Edward D. Cook, \\"Apocalyptic Visions, Humane and Inhuman Protagonists\\" in Edmond Black (ed.) \\"Symposium on Moral Philosophy in Popular Literature of the 1950s and the 1960s\\" \\"Coppel clearly disapproved of the Cold War ideology, prevalent at the time of writing - but his book should not be reduced to simply a cautionary tale about the danger of nuclear war, a danger which we in 1993 consider (hopefully, not prematurely) to have receded. 'Dark December' carries a strongly humane message, which could be relevant as long as human beings are faced with moral choices. In this book, bestial and dark instincts make their very conspicuous appearance, but unlike in 'The Lord of the Flies' they can be overcome. Common decency, solidarity, compassion, love, eventually win out in the most harsh of tests, against overwhelming odds.(...) It is not an overtly religious book, but Collingwood is gradually transformed from simply an extremely authoritarian and fanatic human being into a virtual manifestation of Satan, Evil incarnate - and Coppel manages to make that transformation chillingly believable. (...) The choice of the protagonist's name might not be accidental. Sir Gavin (or Gawain) was among the most famous of King Arthur's Knights, and the quest he undertakes in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is decided on moral more than physical grounds\\". David Seed wrote: \\"An altogether more ambiguous and less high-minded view of human response [is provided by] novels like Alfred Coppel's \\"Dark December\\". [They] show a single character making his way across a shattered landscape presenting obvious physical dangers to his survival, but the prime danger presented to this man comes from another army officer who uses the necessities of the post-war situation to justify the most savage acts. Again and again nuclear war is shown as stripping away the superego of the survivors. And if social restraints are lost, does this mean that the war allows free play to bloodlust and other impulses held in check? Not quite, since the rupture between pre-war and post-war is never total. In Coppel's novel the protagonist has been serving in an underground bunker when the nuclear attack happened, and so the action of Dark December, as well as describing encounters with physical dangers, becomes an extended psychological drama between Gavin's old self and his dark double personified in the crazy Major Collingwood who shadows him everywhere. Collingwood's eventual death therefore symbolises the survival of pre-war civilization, albeit in a tenuous way\\".

It was developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, an Italian-based NGO supporting freedom of speech online. The software empowers anyone, even non-technical people, to easily setup and maintain a whistleblowing platform. History The project concept was initiated by Fabio Pietrosanti and shared for the first time within the hacktivist community on 15 December 2010. Relevant figures in the first development are Claudio Agosti, Arturo Filast√≤, Michele Orr√π, Giovanni Pellerano, and Fabio Pietrosanti. The first prototype was announced on 6 September 2011 on the Full disclosure mailing list. Asked by an interviewer on how the GlobaLeaks project began, Filast√≤ explained: \\"After the whole WikiLeaks Cablegate drama we decided to work on this.\\" The idea for GlobaLeaks \\"was born from the realization of a need for journalists to ensure the confidentiality of their sources despite an insecure network.\\" It is designed to be used by journalists who do not have advanced computer skills but who need a secure platform to protect their sources. The software enables journalists and their sources to communicate securely, allowing \\"a continuous flow of data among individuals with complete security.\\" It also enables journalists to verify sources by requesting various kinds of data and documents. Moreover, GlobaLeaks is more flexible than WikiLeaks, which is only in English, and is centralized, with a focus on \\"events of national and international resonance.\\" GlobaLeaks, by contrast, \\"allows you to communicate in the language of users and is open to local issues with an impact on everyday life.\\" Filast√≤ and his partners noted that most leaksites \\"had poor security,\\" with the vulnerabilities of the Wall Street Journal's whistleblowing dropbox SafeHouse, for instance, being \\"exposed only hours after it went online.\\" Filast√≤ commented that: \\"We saw that there is a user base but the developers were doing it wrong. We said: 'we are security people, we can do this better'. So two years ago we came up with an advanced prototype: Globaleaks 0.1. It was an initial experiment but it went quite well. We then redid it from scratch and we're now at version 2.24.\\". In 2011, Tor2web, Tor Hidden Service proxy designed by Aaron Swartz and Virgil Griffith, became part of the GlobaLeaks project as a component intended for extending platforms reachability to traditional HTTPS connections. In 2012, the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights NGO was founded in Italy. Reception Brandon Stosh has described GlobaLeaks as \\"an open source project aimed at creating a worldwide, anonymous, censorship-resistant, distributed whistleblowing platform.\\" GlobaLeaks seeks \\"to democratize the WikiLeaks model\\" and to become \\"the de-facto standard in technologically- powered whistleblowing\\" focused on the research of the best trade-off between security and usability. The Hermes Center NGO \\"aims to help with the release of information on a different scale than WikiLeaks can address.\\" Pietrosanti said in December 2013, we identified the needed for a \\"solution or software that would enable any organization to engage in whistleblower solicitation, even at the local level.\\" he added. Andy Greenberg has quoted Pietrosanti in saying that Hermes's goal \\"is to expand the leaking movement from the current fifty or so WikiLeaks copycats to a network of hundreds or thousands of 'leak nodes' run by everyone from U.S. corporations that are legally mandated to run an internal whistleblowing outlet to radical activists that hope to pass their materials on to publishers while using Tor to remain completely anonymous.\\" GlobaLeaks, wrote Greenberg, \\"aims to disperse the risk of handling sensitive material over an army of individuals rather than one vulnerable group of intermediaries. 'Some people may be like Assange, and say, OK, we'll publish and fight and whatever,' says Pietrosanti. 'But lots of people want to fight corruption without taking that much responsibility. If the risk profile of everyone who runs a leak node is reduced, there will be a lot more leak nodes. WikiLeaks taught us something. And it brought the word whistleblower back into the awareness of the public (...) But GlobaLeaks is the next logical step.\\" Filast√≤ added. In October 2013, Tessel Renzenbrink wrote in her article \\"Building an Infrastructure for Whistleblowing\\" that \\"there are very few protection mechanisms in place for whistleblowers,\\" and that because of this, \\"whistleblowing featured as an important topic at OHM2013, the biggest outdoor hacker festival in Europe.\\" At the festival, Renzenbrink spoke with people from \\"several organizations that have started initiatives to build a better whistleblowing infrastructure,\\" including Filast√≤, who told her: \\"Globaleaks is a software designed to allow anybody to easily set up a whistleblower site\\". Filast√≤ emphasized that \\"It is open source software so anybody can download it, install it and have a whistleblower site set up. (...) we don't run a whistleblowing platform ourselves (...) but we contribute to this ecosystem by enabling other people to run successful initiatives.\\" Operation A GlobaLeaks site utilizes Tor Hidden Services in order to guarantee the anonymity of the source. Once the submission is performed on a GlobaLeaks platform, the data is encrypted using PGP and the system automatically notifies registered recipients (e.g., local media, NGOs, or even single journalists). GlobaLeaks platforms do not store anything permanently and the submitted information and files are deleted as soon as possible with a strict data retention policy. The process is generally improved by suggesting the sources to use the Tails anonymous operating system while connecting to GlobaLeaks. JavaScript is required from the user agent to access GlobaLeaks.Reference to the \\"Javascript required\\" page why Javascript it's required article #1928 Github Implementations By 2019, GlobaLeaks has been internationalized in 20+ languages and implemented by several thousands projects and initiatives all over the world. The vast range of adopters include independent media, activists, media agencies, corporations, and more. Describing the early deployments, Wired reporter John Borland, GlobaLeaks had been \\"deployed around Europe, by independent journalism and activist groups in Serbia, investigative journalism organizations in Hungary and Italy, and an anti-Mafia group in Italy.\\" Borland noted that \\"A GlobaLeaks-powered whistleblowing site in Iceland, called Ljost, today [30 December 2013] released new documents on that country's 2008 financial collapse.\\" Pietrosanti told Borland that GlobaLeaks was \\"currently talking with organizations in a number of other countries, including several media groups that want to replicate the successful Dutch model.\\" Borland added that \\"activists are also examining topic-specific leaks sites for issues such as human rights, wildlife crimes, surveillance, food safety in the United States, and censorship.\\" The largest implementation of GlobaLeaks occurred in 2014 by PubLeaks in the Netherlands, \\"a foundation that counts 42 of the country's biggest media organizations among its members. There, each organization pays ‚Ç¨500 per year, and in return receives a special laptop designed to access the leak system.\\" Borland noted that \\"When accessing Publeaks from the web, whistleblowers can choose to send information to three of these media organizations. All participating organizations agree to honor embargo periods, enabling information to be examined without immediate publication pressure. The group has already had several high-profile leaks, including one that led to the resignation of a prominent parliamentarian.\\" Other major organizations supporting the setup of GlobaLeaks based whistleblowing platforms are Free Press Unlimited (FPU) and Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP). FPU, a Netherland-based organization, created AfriLeaks and M√©xicoLeaks. AfriLeaks was GlobaLeaks' first project outside the western world run by an alliance of 15+ African news organisations that are committed to speaking truth to power. \\"Whistleblowing is an important instrument that should be used carefully, so future training is now being planned and will continue to take place regularly.\\" said Pellerano to the Guardian. As for M√©xicoLeaks, it is an active independent whistleblowing platform aimed at revealing information for the public interest in Mexico which was awarded the 2016 FRIDA award. AWP, a Belgium-based organization, created Ljost (Iceland), Filtrala (Spain), EcuadorTransparente (Ecuador) and PeruLeaks (Peru). AWP co-founder Pedro Noel describes AWP as \\"a nonprofit organization which struggles for freedom of expression and against human rights violations by means of whistleblowing.\\" One of the most successful GlobaLeaks projects is WildLeaks, the world's first whistleblower initiative dedicated to Wildlife and Forest Crime funded and managed by the Elephant Action League (EAL) which reported and investigated various crimes. One of the investigations was highlighted in the award-winning Netflix documentary \\"The Ivory Game\\". GlobaLeaks also partnered with major anticorruption and human rights NGOs like Transparency International Allerta Anticorruzione, OCCRP (OCCRPLeaks) and Amnesty International Amlea. In 2017, Xnet, an activist project which has been working on and for networked democracy and digital rights since 2008, launched in the Barcelona City Hall the first public Anti-Corruption Complaint Box using anonymity protection technology like Tor and GlobaLeaks (\\"B√∫stia √àtica\\" in Catalan). With this pioneering project, the Barcelona City Hall is the first municipal government to invite citizens to use tools which enable them to send information in a way that is secure, that guarantees privacy and gives citizens the option to be totally anonymous. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. In 2018 the Italian Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC), an administrative watchdog, launched their national online whistleblowing platform using GlobaLeaks and onion services, giving whistleblowers who come forward a secure way to report illegal activity while protecting their identities. Funding In 2011, GlobaLeaks 0.1 received funding from USAID Serbia. In 2012, GlobaLeaks 2.0 had been funded with $108,400 by the Open Technology Fund under the Freedom2Connect program. In 2013, the project was able to survive with few donations and a lot of volunteer work done by its core members. In 2014, Hermes Center has been awarded ‚Ç¨200,000 by the Hivos Foundation for Project Deployments of Whistleblowing Initiatives in the Global South. In July 2014, GlobaLeaks project has been funded with ~$234,000 by the Open Technology Fund in order to develop a new Roadmap from Q3/2014 up to Q1/2016 for which all progress reports are publicly available. In September 2014, Transparency International Italy started up its AntiCorruption Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre (ALAC) with a contribution of ‚Ç¨6,000 from an EU grant.

Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a state cannot preemptively prohibit persons from holding a public meeting, without first notifying the persons involved, and providing the persons an opportunity to argue the decision, unless moving party can show (per the equivalent of today's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65) (1) that they made efforts to give to notice, and (2) explain to the court the reasons why such notice should not be required. The National States Rights Party won the case unanimously.  Background  A white supremacist group, the National States Rights Party, held a rally in Princess Anne, Maryland on August 6, 1966. They intended to hold another public meeting the following day, but local citizens persuaded a Circuit Court judge to issue a 10-day restraining order, prohibiting the group from holding any rally \\"which will tend to disturb and endanger the citizens of the County\\". The Party was not given any advance notice of the restraining order, nor given an opportunity to argue against it. The Circuit Court then issued a 10-month restraining order. The Maryland court of appeals overturned the 10 month order, but upheld the 10 day order. The Party appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court held that the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process required the state to provide the group with notice and a hearing before a restraining order could be issued. Justice Black concurred in the judgment. The 10 day restraining order was set aside.

The highway connects southwest Chatham County with the county seat of Pittsboro. NC 902 has mostly rural routing going northeast most of the way. NC 902 was created in 1929 running from U.S. Route 64 (US 64) near Asheboro to Carthage but has since been truncated to its current routing over a long period of time. Route description NC 902 begins at NC 22/NC 42 south of Bennett. NC 902 heads east from there and crosses Falls Creek. From there NC 902 turns northeast and goes through Harpers Crossroads at the intersection of Siler City Glendon Road. The road intersects Edwards Hill Church Road (Secondary Road 1141 or SR 1141) on its way to Bear Creek. The road crosses over Bear Creek before reaching the eponymous town about down the road. When the route finally enters Bear Creek it crosses over a Norfolk Southern railroad and then intersects Old US 421 S. After the road leaves Bear Creek it crosses over Sandy Branch. NC 902 intersects US 421 northeast of Bear Creek and from there continues northeast to cross Landrum Creek. Approximately one mile from the crossing of Landrum Creek, NC 902 turns to the east to parallel US 64\\\\. The road turns left on Pittsboro Goldston Road, and starts to again head northeast towards Pittsboro. NC 902 intersects NC 87 just south of downtown Pittsboro and turns north. NC 902 ends at US 64 Business (US 64 Bus.) in downtown Pittsboro. History NC 902 first appeared on the North Carolina state highway map running from US 64/NC 90 in Asheboro to NC 74 (now NC 24/NC 27) west of Carthage. By 1933, NC 902 was removed off its routing from Bennett to its western terminus near Carthage. Instead NC 902 was routed along a concurrency with NC 64 and then along new routing to US 421 near Bear Creek. Between 1958-63, NC 902 was truncated, just south of Bennett, at NC 22/NC 42; the old alignment became part of NC 42. In 1964, NC 902 was extended east to its current eastern terminus at US 64 (now US 64 Bus.) and NC 87 in Pittsboro. In 2000, NC 87 was rerouted onto of NC 902 in Pittsboro.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Phasmoconus M√∂rch, 1852 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is elongated and subcylindrical in shape with angulate shoulders. The protoconch is usually multispiral, but rarely paucispiral. The anal notch is shallow, and an anterior notch is either slight or absent. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth is approximately the same length as the posterior section but in some species one section may be longer than the other. The blade extends less than one-half the length of the anterior section of the radular tooth. A basal spur is absent, and the barb is short. The waist is obvious, and there is an elongated terminating cusp. There is a short row of serrations between the barb and accessory process. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the Indo-Pacific and Australian regions. ::Feeding habits :::These species are piscivorous, meaning that these cone snails prey on fish.

DynamoDB exposes a similar data model to and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation. Dynamo had a multi-master design requiring the client to resolve version conflicts and DynamoDB uses synchronous replication across multiple data centers for high durability and availability. DynamoDB was announced by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels on January 18, 2012, and is presented as an evolution of Amazon SimpleDB solution. Background Werner Vogels, CTO at Amazon.com, provided a motivation for the project in his 2012 announcement. Amazon began as a decentralized network of services. Originally, services had direct access to each other's databases. When this became a bottleneck on engineering operations, services moved away from this direct access pattern in favor of public-facing APIs. Still, third-party relational database management systems struggled to handle Amazon's client base. This culminated during the 2004 holiday season, when several technologies failed under high traffic. Engineers were normalizing these relational systems to reduce data redundancy, a design that optimizes for storage. The sacrifice: they stored a given \\"item\\" of data (e.g., the information pertaining to a product in a product database) over several relations, and it takes time to assemble disjoint parts for a query. Many of Amazon's services demanded mostly primary-key reads on their data, and with speed a top priority, putting these pieces together was extremely taxing. Content with compromising storage efficiency, Amazon's response was Dynamo: a highly available key-value store built for internal use. Dynamo, it seemed, was everything their engineers needed, but adoption lagged. Amazon's developers opted for \\"just works\\" design patterns with S3 and SimpleDB. While these systems had noticeable design flaws, they did not demand the overhead of provisioning hardware and scaling and re-partitioning data. Amazon's next iteration of NoSQL technology, DynamoDB, automated these database management operations. Overview Web console DynamoDB differs from other Amazon services by allowing developers to purchase a service based on throughput, rather than storage. If Auto Scaling is enabled, then the database will scale automatically. Additionally, administrators can request throughput changes and DynamoDB will spread the data and traffic over a number of servers using solid-state drives, allowing predictable performance. It offers integration with Hadoop via Elastic MapReduce. In September 2013, Amazon made a local development version of DynamoDB available so developers could test DynamoDB-backed applications locally. Development considerations  Data modeling  Web console overview A DynamoDB table features items that have attributes, some of which form a primary key. In relational systems, however, an item features each table attribute (or juggles \\"null\\" and \\"unknown\\" values in their absence), DynamoDB items are schema-less. The only exception: when creating a table, a developer specifies a primary key, and the table requires a key for every item. Primary keys must be scalar (strings, numbers, or binary) and can take one of two forms. A single-attribute primary key is known as the table's \\"partition key\\", which determines the partition that an item hashes to‚Äì‚Äìmore on partitioning below‚Äì‚Äìso an ideal partition key has a uniform distribution over its range. A primary key can also feature a second attribute, which DynamoDB calls the table's \\"sort key\\". In this case, partition keys do not have to be unique; they are paired with sort keys to make a unique identifier for each item. The partition key is still used to determine which partition the item is stored in, but within each partition, items are sorted by the sort key.  Indices  In the relational model, indices typically serve as \\"helper\\" data structures to supplement a table. They allow the DBMS to optimize queries under the hood and they do not improve query functionality. In DynamoDB, there is no query optimizer, and an index is simply another table with a different key (or two) that sits beside the original. When a developer creates an index, they create a new copy of their data, but only the fields that they specified get copied over (at a minimum, the fields that they index on and the original table's primary key). DynamoDB users issue queries directly to their indices. There are two types of indices available. A global secondary index features a partition key (and optional sort key) that's different from the original table's partition key. A local secondary index features the same partition key as the original table, but a different sort key. Both indices introduce entirely new query functionality to a DynamoDB database by allowing queries on new keys. Similar to relational database management systems, DynamoDB updates indices automatically on addition/update/deletion, so you must be judicious when creating them or risk slowing down a write-heavy database with a slew of index updates.  Syntax  DynamoDB uses JSON for its syntax because of its ubiquity. The create table action demands just three arguments: TableName, KeySchema‚Äì‚Äìa list containing a partition key and an optional sort key‚Äì‚Äìand AttributeDefinitions‚Äì‚Äìa list of attributes to be defined which must at least contain definitions for the attributes used as partition and sort keys. Whereas relational databases offer robust query languages, DynamoDB offers just Put, Get, Update, and Delete operations. Put requests contain the TableName attribute and an Item attribute, which consists of all the attributes and values the item has. An Update request follows the same syntax. Similarly, to get or delete an item, simply specify a TableName and Key. System architecture Creation table in DynamoDB  Data structures  DynamoDB uses hashing and B-trees to manage data. Upon entry, data is first distributed into different partitions by hashing on the partition key. Each partition can store up to 10GB of data and handle by default 1,000 write capacity units (WCU) and 3,000 read capacity units (RCU). One RCU represents one strongly consistent read per second or two eventually consistent reads per second for items up to 4KB in size. One WCU represents one write per second for an item up to 1KB in size. To prevent data loss, DynamoDB features a two- tier backup system of replication and long-term storage. Each partition features three nodes, each of which contains a copy of that partition's data. Each node also contains two data structures: a B tree used to locate items, and a replication log that notes all changes made to the node. DynamoDB periodically takes snapshots of these two data structures and stores them for a month in S3 so that engineers can perform point-in-time restores of their databases. Within each partition, one of the three nodes is designated the \\"leader node\\". All write operations travel first through the leader node before propagating, which makes writes consistent in DynamoDB. To maintain its status, the leader sends a \\"heartbeat\\" to each other node every 1.5 seconds. Should another node stop receiving heartbeats, it can initiate a new leader election. DynamoDB uses the Paxos algorithm to elect leaders. Amazon engineers originally avoided Dynamo due to engineering overheads like provisioning and managing partitions and nodes. In response, the DynamoDB team built a service it calls AutoAdmin to manage a database. AutoAdmin replaces a node when it stops responding by copying data from another node. When a partition exceeds any of its three thresholds (RCU, WCU, or 10GB), AutoAdmin will automatically add additional partitions to further segment the data. Just like indexing systems in the relational model, DynamoDB demands that any updates to a table be reflected in each of the table's indices. DynamoDB handles this using a service it calls the \\"log propagator\\", which subscribes to the replication logs in each node and sends additional Put, Update, and Delete requests to indices as necessary. Because indices result in substantial performance hits for write requests, DynamoDB allows a user at most five of them on any given table.  Query execution  Suppose that a DynamoDB user issues a write operation (a Put, Update, or Delete). While a typical relational system would convert the SQL query to relational algebra and run optimization algorithms, DynamoDB skips both processes and gets right to work. The request arrives at the DynamoDB request router, which authenticates‚Äì‚Äì\\"Is the request coming from where/whom it claims to be?\\"‚Äì‚Äìand checks for authorization‚Äì‚Äì\\"Does the user submitting the request have the requisite permissions?\\" Assuming these checks pass, the system hashes the request's partition key to arrive in the appropriate partition. There are three nodes within, each with a copy of the partition's data. The system first writes to the leader node, then writes to a second node, then sends a \\"success\\" message, and finally continues propagating to the third node. Writes are consistent because they always travel first through the leader node. Finally, the log propagator propagates the change to all indices. For each index, it grabs that index's primary key value from the item, then performs the same write on that index without log propagation. If the operation is an Update to a preexisting item, the updated attribute may serve as a primary key for an index, and thus the B tree for that index must update as well. B trees only handle insert, delete, and read operations, so in practice, when the log propagator receives an Update operation, it issues both a Delete operation and a Put operation to all indices. Now suppose that a DynamoDB user issues a Get operation. The request router proceeds as before with authentication and authorization. Next, as above, we hash our partition key to arrive in the appropriate hash. Now, we encounter a problem: with three nodes in eventual consistency with one another, how can we decide which to investigate? DynamoDB affords the user two options when issuing a read: consistent and eventually consistent. A consistent read visits the leader node. But the consistency-availability trade-off rears its head again here: in read-heavy systems, always reading from the leader can overwhelm a single node and reduce availability. The second option, an eventually consistent read, selects a random node. In practice, this is where DynamoDB trades consistency for availability. If we take this route, what are the odds of an inconsistency? We'd need a write operation to return \\"success\\" and begin propagating to the third node, but not finish. We'd also need our Get to target this third node. This means a 1-in-3 chance of inconsistency within the write operation's propagation window. How long is this window? Any number of catastrophes could cause a node to fall behind, but in the vast majority of cases, the third node is up-to-date within milliseconds of the leader. Performance Capacity tab, scaling DynamoDB exposes performance metrics that help users provision it correctly and keep applications using DynamoDB running smoothly: * Requests and throttling *Errors: ProvisionedThroughputExceededException,ConditionalCheckFailedException,Internal Server Error(HTTP 500) * Metrics related to Global Secondary Index creation These metrics can be tracked using the AWS Management Console, using the AWS Command Line Interface, or a monitoring tool integrating with Amazon CloudWatch. Language bindings Languages and frameworks with a DynamoDB binding include Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, C# .NET, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Django, and Grails.

The house is located on 9439 Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California in the United States. The house was designed for Herbert and Hazel Kronish. Architecture The Kronish House features a formal, pinwheel design. Not visible from the street, the one-story house sits at the end of a 250-foot-long driveway on a 2-acre lot. With 6,891 square feet of living space, six bedrooms and 51/2 bathrooms, the contemporary home is the Neutra's largest in Southern California.Lauren Beale (October 14, 2011), Richard Neutra-designed Kronish house sells for $12.8 million Los Angeles Times. The glass-enclosed garden area is visible from several rooms. The original pool was also designed by Neutra. History The house is one of only three Neutra designs ever built in Beverly Hills, and the only one that remains intact (one was demolished, the other completely altered). It was originally built for real estate developer Herbert Kronish and his wife Hazel, who had bought the property from actress Shirley Temple In an October 1953 letter, the couple stated they did not want a design that looked like a wooden box or had a flat roof, radiant heating or sliding doors ‚Äî Neutra trademarks.Martha Groves (July 24, 2011), Neutra's Kronish House appears to be bound for demolition Los Angeles Times. The house was owned briefly by Norton Simon and Jennifer Jones, before it was sold in 1999. Neighboring estates include Madonna's former Beverly Hills home. From near demolition to preservation In January 2011, the house was sold in a foreclosure auction for $5.8 million. During that summer, the new owners applied for a permit to cap the house's sewer line, which is often a sign of preparing a building for demolition. The home was in such poor condition that broker firm Hilton & Hyland was trying to sell it for its land value alone.Alexei Barrionuevo (May 10, 2012), Big Deal - In Beverly Hills, Preservation Gains a Toehold New York Times. Upon the news, the Los Angeles Conservancy, and other advocacy groups, lobbied the city of Beverly Hills to delay the demolition. Richard Neutra's son, Dion Neutra helped to lobby assistance to save the house. Among the alternatives to demolition being considered was relocating the house off site. Stavros Niarchos Jr., grandson of the Greek shipping tycoon, eventually purchased the house in October for $12.8 million, which was originally being offered for $13.995 million, saving it from demolition. As a consequence, the city of Beverly Hills passed unanimously a local preservation ordinance, requiring a 30-day holding period for alterations to structures 45 years or older designed by a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù architect. In 2014, the architecture firm Marmol Radziner completed the rehabilitation of the historic home, restoring it to its original footprint, and also adding a guest house.

Early years She studied psychology at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara after finishing the French Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul. At the age of 17, Bal√ßi√ßek ƒ∞lter started to write at the Turkish edition of Cosmopolitan magazine promoted by Ercan Arƒ±klƒ±, a prominent journalist. Still in high school, she wrote for the political magazine Aktuel. During her university years, she continued to write at Aktuel's Ankara office. She gained wide experience in journalism during this time and after her transfer to the Ankara office of Sabah newspaper. Career At the age of 29, she became Sabah's editor-in-chief, the first woman to hold this title so far at the newspaper. Bal√ßi√ßek ƒ∞lter left Sabah to join Habert√ºrk, after her writings were heavily criticized . Additionally, she was tasked to present programmes at Habert√ºrk TV, the sister media of newspaper Habert√ºrk. Currently, she presents two programmes \\"S√∂z Sende\\" (It's your turn to talk) on weekdays and \\"Kar≈üƒ±t G√∂r√º≈ü\\" (Opposite Opinion) at prime time on Wednesdays at Habert√ºrk TV channel, hosting notable guests from various fields like politics, economics and arts. Manipulative news and incitement of popular hatred Controversy During the Gezi protests in Turkey, she wrote in her column an interview about a woman named Zehra Develioƒülu, who falsely claimed that 70 up to 100 shirtless men in leather pants had beaten and afterwards urinated on her because she was wearing a scarf and showing that she was a Muslim. This news instantly sparked outrage in the country and a discredit campaign against the protesters was launched by mostly state-controlled media in Turkey. This and another fabricated news about \\"protesters drinking beer in a mosque\\" helped the Islamic government of Turkey to gain the support of the mostly uneducated Islamic masses in Turkey to stop the protests violently. In February 2014, released surveillance camera videos from the time and place where Develioƒülu and Ilter claimed that the incident happened were released showing Develioƒülu passing by a crowd of protesters without any physical contact. Since then Ilter had sent out Tweets to apologize and to throw Develioƒülu under the bus. During the discredit campaign it came out that Zehra Develioƒülu was the daughter-in-law of the Bah√ßelievler district mayor from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Ilter wrote in her column in the daily T√ºrkiye on February 15, 2014, that she tried to get in contact with Develioƒülu or her father-in-law with no success after she saw in the released footage that there was no physical attack on the headscarf-wearing woman. ƒ∞lter admitted her mistake, and stated that she might have made many mistakes in her 23-year-long journalism career. Personal life Bal√ßi√ßek ƒ∞lter was married in 2003 to Ali Pamir, a marketing and advertising specialist. She gave birth to twins, daughter Lal and son Kuzey, on May 17, 2007. The couple divorced in October 2010. She gave up her family name Pamir, since her husband did not allow that she bears his surname.

It premiered on 30 April 1695 at Betterton's Co., Lincoln's Inn Fields.Information sheet on Love for Love.Accessed 21 January 2012 Characters The play is a comical farce enlivened by its witty dialogue and its humorous characters, and perhaps more successful in its day than The Way of the World, now considered Congreve's best. The main character is Valentine, then Jeremy, Valentine's resourceful servant; Sir Sampson, with his 'blunt vivacity'; Ben, the rough young sea-dog, who intends to marry whom he chooses; Miss Prue, only too ready to learn the lessons in love given her by Tattle, the vain, half-witted beau, who finds himself married to Mrs. Frail, the lady of easy virtue, when he thinks he has captured Angelica; and Foresight, the gullible old astrologer.A. G. Henderson, The Comedies of William Congreve, Cambridge University Press (1982). Dramatis Personae *Sir Sampson Legend, father to Valentine and Ben *Valentine, fallen under his father's displeasure by his expensive way of living, in love with Angelica *Scandal, his friend, a free speaker *Tattle, a half-witted beau, vain of his amours, yet valuing himself for secrecy *Ben, Sir Sampson's younger son, half home-bred and half sea-bred, designed to marry Miss Prue *Foresight, an illiterate old fellow, peevish and positive, superstitious, and pretending to understand astrology, palmistry, physiognomy, omens, dreams, etc., uncle to Angelica *Jeremy, servant to Valentine *Trapland, a scrivener *Buckram, a lawyer *Angelica, niece to Foresight, of a considerable fortune in her own hands *Mrs. Foresight, second wife to Foresight *Mrs. Frail, sister to Mrs. Foresight, a woman of the town *Miss Prue, daughter to Foresight by a former wife, a silly, awkward country girl *Nurse, to Miss Prue *Jenny, maid to Angelica *A Steward, Officers, Sailors, and several servants Plot Valentine has fallen under the displeasure of his father by his extravagance, and is besieged by creditors. His father, Sir Sampson Legend, offers him ¬£4000 (only enough to pay his debts) if he will sign a bond engaging to make over his right to his inheritance to his younger brother Ben. Valentine, to escape from his embarrassment, signs the bond. He is in love with Angelica, who possesses a fortune of her own, but so far she has not yielded to his suit. Sir Sampson has arranged a match between Ben, who is at sea, and Miss Prue, an awkward country girl, the daughter of Foresight, a superstitious old fool who claims to be an astrologer. Valentine, realizing the ruin entailed by the signature of the bond, tries to move his father by submission, and fails; then pretends to be mad and unable to sign the final deed of conveyance to his brother. Finally Angelica intervenes. She induces Sir Sampson to propose marriage to her, pretends to accept, and gets possession of Valentine's bond. When Valentine, in despair at finding that Angelica is about to marry his father, declares himself ready to sign the conveyance, she reveals the plot, tears up the bond, and declares her love for Valentine.G.

Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966), was a United States Supreme Court case.  Background  Julian Bond, an African American, was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in June 1965. Bond was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) which opposed the Vietnam War. After election, during a news interview, Bond endorsed the SNCC's views, and stated that he did not support the war, and, as a pacifist, he was opposed to all war. Members of the Georgia House of Representatives objected to Bond's statements, and petitioned to prohibit him from joining the House. A hearing was held, and Bond repeated his pacifist viewpoints, but maintained that he never urged draft-card burning or other law violations. The House committee voted to prohibit Bond from joining the House. Bond sued in federal court, but the District Court upheld the House, concluding that Bond's remarks exceeded criticism of national policy and that he could not in good faith take an oath to support the State and Federal Constitutions. Bond appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ordered the Georgia House of Representatives to permit Bond to take his seat. The Court held: * Though a State may impose oath requirements on legislators, it cannot limit their capacity to express views on local or national policy. * A majority of state legislators is not authorized to test the sincerity with which another duly elected legislator meets the requirement for holding office of swearing to support the Federal and State Constitutions. * The State may not apply to a legislator a First Amendment standard stricter than that applicable to a private citizen.

A female seminary is a private educational institution for women, popular especially in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when opportunities in educational institutions for women were scarce. The movement was a significant part of a remarkable transformation in American education in the period 1820‚Äì1850. article consists of 15 pages Supporting academic education for women, the seminaries were part of a large and growing trend toward women's 'equality'. Some trace its roots to 1815, and characterize it as at the confluence of various liberation movements. Some of the seminaries gradually developed as four-year colleges. History The Bethlehem Female Seminary was founded in 1742 in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Established as a seminary for girls, it eventually became the Moravian Seminary and College for Women and later merged with nearby schools to become the coeducational Moravian College. The Girls' School of the Single Sister's House was founded in 1772 in what is now Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Originally established as a primary school, it later became an academy (high school) and finally a college. It is the oldest female educational establishment that is still a women's college (Salem College), and the oldest female institution in the Southern United States. Female seminaries were a cultural phenomenon across the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. They succeeded the boarding school, which had offered a more family-like atmosphere. In contrast, seminaries were often larger institutions run by more professionalized teachers, an equivalent to men's colleges. Such parity between men's and women's education had been demanded by notable educators and women's rights activists such as Emma Willard and Catharine Beecher. Willard founded the Troy Female Seminary in 1821, which is hailed as the first institute in the US for women's higher education. Beecher (the sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe) founded the Hartford Female Seminary in 1823, promoted female education and teaching in the American West in the 1830s, and in 1851 started the American Women's Educational Association. Much was at stake in women's education, which was reflected in the very name \\"seminary\\": > In the early nineteenth century the word seminary began to replace the word > academy. The new word connoted a certain seriousness. The seminary saw its > task primarily as professional preparation. The male seminary prepared men > for the ministry; the female seminary took as its earnest job the training > of women for teaching and for Republican motherhood. Of 6085 seminaries and academies operating in the United States in the period circa 1850, fully half were devoted to women, many of them started by Evangelical Christians. The female seminary movement helped foster a huge growth in female literacy; the rate went from being half that of males to matching it. Some seminaries were converted to coeducational institutions. For example, the Green River Female Academy in Todd County, Kentucky admitted men and changed its name. It is now known as the University of the Cumberlands. Regional developments In New England towns, female seminaries were a vital and influential force in the \\"training of New England women between 1815 and 1840... they were scattered throughout the region.\\" Such seminaries offered advanced training for daughters of farmers and professionals. While sentimental values were core, emotional piety and religious revival were key features. They served to propagate and disseminate sexual stereotypes and gender roles. Discipline was a main goal, not student liberation or a \\"broadening of their limited horizons\\". The seminaries managed to inculcate manners, decorum, discipline, and domesticity. While they may not have been a force for freeing women, \\"many teachers, some missionaries, many ministers' wives, and numerous other useful citizens\\" were counted among alumnae. New England seminaries propagated numerous direct descendants including Lake Erie and Mills Colleges. Southern iterations were among the country's most advanced, offering the equivalent of four-year college programs before the Civil War. In the South, there was \\"an unprecedented social experiment in women's education\\". Southern female seminaries educated daughters, and \\"education in a renowned and fashionable seminary conferred social capital as well as intellectual and artistic satisfaction\\". Trends throughout the United States included expanding facilities in a more institutional format, with more academic classes. Classical building structures became a norm, in sharp contrast to earlier forms of female education. By midcentury, \\"female seminaries and academies were everywhere, replacing the homelike atmosphere of boarding schools with a more institutional setting\\". Within were housed chapels, classrooms, dining halls, and dormitories. Female seminaries began to emerge in the Midwest in the 1830s. The movement was heavily informed by the female seminary movement in New England, from which it drew many of its teachers. In states that had not yet instituted free public secondary schools, both female and coeducational seminaries often emerged as private solutions to this need. Many of these institutions received state aid, and many subsequently merged into the local public school districts. A few, such as the Mount Carroll Seminary (which later became Shimer College), avoided this fate and continued as independent women's institutions.

It is cryptically coloured with vertical stripes and has special adaptations to its legs to enable it to cling to its host's spines. Description Z. adamsii is a small crab, described as \\"a torpid, though elegant little crustacean\\" by the English naturalist Arthur Adams when it was first discovered by him and the Scottish zoologist Adam White during the surveying voyage of HMS Samarang in the Far East between 1843 and 1846. The carapace and limbs are smooth and hairless and are adorned with long spines. The colour is pink with dark, reddish-brown vertical stripes. Distribution Z. adamsii has a wide distribution in shallow water in the tropical Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean. The type locality is the estuary of the Pantai River in Borneo at a depth of about . Ecology Z. adamsii lives in symbiosis with a sea urchin, living among its spines. Sea urchins on which it has been found include Asthenosoma ijimai, Diadema setosum, Heliocidaris crassispina, Pseudocentrotus depressus, Salmacis bicolor, Salmacis virgulata, Toxopneustes elegans, Toxopneustes pileolus, Tripneustes gratilla and a species of Acanthocidaris. Adaptations for this lifestyle include a specialist joint between the propodus and dactylus on the walking legs enabling the crab to cling to its host, and cryptic colouring in the form of vertical stripes. Females are slightly larger than males and usually live singly on a sea urchin while males move from one urchin to another searching for females. Z. adamsii feeds on its host's tube feet and on the epidermal tissue covering the test and the base of the spines. This does little harm to the host which readily regenerates both the tissue and the tube feet. Z. adamsii larvae are planktonic and pass through four zoeal stages, and one megalopa stage before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile crabs.

The class contains the density functions of all distributions that have characteristic functions that are strictly proper rational functions (i.e., the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator). Definition A 2-EPT probability density function is a probability density function on \\\\mathbb{R} with a strictly proper rational characteristic function. On either [0, +\\\\infty) or (-\\\\infty, 0) these probability density functions are exponential- polynomial-trigonometric (EPT) functions. Any EPT density function on (-\\\\infty, 0) can be represented as :f(x)=\\\\textbf{c}_Ne^{\\\\textbf{A}_Nx}\\\\textbf{b}_N , where e represents a matrix exponential, (\\\\textbf{A}_N,\\\\textbf{A}_P) are square matrices, (\\\\textbf{b}_N,\\\\textbf{b}_P) are column vectors and (\\\\textbf{c}_N,\\\\textbf{c}_P) are row vectors. Similarly the EPT density function on [0, -\\\\infty) is expressed as :f(x)=\\\\textbf{c}_Pe^{\\\\textbf{A}_Px}\\\\textbf{b}_P. The parameterization (\\\\textbf{A}_N,\\\\textbf{b}_N,\\\\textbf{c}_N,\\\\textbf{A}_P,\\\\textbf{b}_P,\\\\textbf{c}_P) is the minimal realizationKailath, T. (1980) Linear Systems, Prentice Hall, 1980 of the 2-EPT function. The general class of probability measures on \\\\mathbb{R} with (proper) rational characteristic functions are densities corresponding to mixtures of the pointmass at zero (\\"delta distribution\\") and 2-EPT densities. Unlike phase-type and matrix geometricNeuts, M. \\"Probability Distributions of Phase Type\\", Liber Amicorum Prof. Emeritus H. Florin pages 173-206, Department of Mathematics, University of Louvain, Belgium 1975 distributions, the 2-EPT probability density functions are defined on the whole real line. It has been shown that the class of 2-EPT densities is closed under many operations and using minimal realizations these calculations have been illustrated for the two-sided framework in Sexton and Hanzon.Sexton, C. and Hanzon,B.,\\"State Space Calculations for two-sided EPT Densities with Financial Modelling Applications\\", www.2-ept.com The most involved operation is the convolution of 2-EPT densities using state space techniques. Much of the work centers on the ability to decompose the rational characteristic function into the sum of two rational functions with poles located in either the open left or open right half plane. The variance-gamma distribution density has been shown to be a 2-EPT density under a parameter restriction and the variance gamma processMadan, D., Carr, P., Chang, E.

It can be shown using Parseval's theorem and an isometry that approximating the discrete time rational transform is equivalent to approximating the 2-EPT density itself in the L-2 Norm sense.

Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that states cannot prohibit employees from being members of the Communist Party and that this law was overbroad and too vague.  Background  New York State had laws that prohibited state employees from belonging to any organization that advocated the overthrow of the US government or was \\"treasonous\\" or \\"seditious.\\" The regents of the State University of New York also required teachers and employees to sign an oath that they were not members of the Communist Party. Some faculty and staff of the University were terminated for refusing to sign the oath and appealed to the Supreme Court.  Decision  The Supreme Court, in a 5‚Äì4 decision, overturned the New York state laws prohibiting membership in seditious groups because it was too vague and was overbroad.

Washington, 390 U.S. 333 (1968), is a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld an appeals court decision to forbid segregation of public prisons.. Background The state of Alabama segregated its jails, juvenile jails, and prisons based on race. White prisoners were housed separately from African-American prisoners. In 1966, American Civil Liberties Union leader Charles Morgan, Jr. filed suit against Alabama, asking that the jails and prisons be desegregated. This was 12 years after the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education which outlawed school segregation. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama found in favor of the prisoners, and ordered Alabama to desegregate its jails and prisons. Alabama had argued that segregation was necessary in order to maintain security and minimize violence, but the Appeals court held that \\"this Court can conceive of no consideration of prison security or discipline which will sustain the constitutionality of state statutes that on their face require complete and permanent segregation of the races in all the Alabama penal facilities. We recognize that there is merit in the contention that in some isolated instances prison security and discipline necessitates segregation of the races for a limited period. However, recognition of such instances does nothing to bolster the statutes or the general practice that requires or permits prison or jail officials to separate the races arbitrarily. Such statutes and practices must be declared unconstitutional in light of the clear principles controlling.\\"  Opinion of the Court  Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the Appeals court decision in a very brief per curiam opinion. Justices Black, Harlan, and Stewart collectively wrote a concurring opinion in which they explicitly say that \\"prison authorities have the right, acting in good faith and in particularized circumstances, to take into account racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and jails.\\"  See also  * Brown v.

Lyrically, the song alludes to oneself questioning the status of their relationship. The song makes frequent references to pop icon Marilyn Monroe, with many of her quotes woven into the song.http://www.mtv.com/news/2497025/nicki-minaj-marilyn- monroe-song-leak/ \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" was generally well received by music critics, with some noting its crossover potential, while others felt like the song was too similar to other artists. The song has received comparisons to the 2011 singles \\"Disaster\\" by JoJo and \\"Stuttering\\" by Fefe Dobson, as well as Minaj's own 2010 single \\"Your Love\\" from her debut album Pink Friday. The album's high digital sales led \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" to chart on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard charts. Production and composition Marilyn Monroe (pictured) is the main inspiration behind the song. Following the success of Minaj's debut album, Pink Friday, Cash Money co-CEO, Brian \\"Birdman\\" Williams announced to Billboard that Minaj was aiming for a first quarter release in 2012. In November 2011, Minaj announced on Twitter that the album would be released on February 14, 2012, though it was later delayed to April 3, 2012. The album focuses on Roman Zolanski, one of Minaj's alter egos that was first featured on Pink Friday. J.R. Rotem, who previously produced a track for Minaj's debut album, originally conceived \\"Marilyn Monroe\\". According to Minaj, \\"He hit me up and he said, 'I have a song that I think only an icon can sing'. I was like, 'Oh J.R., shut up!' We laughed a little bit on iChat.\\" It was written by Minaj, Daniel James, Leah Haywood, Ross Golan and Rotem. Rotem and Dreamlab produced the track, with vocal production handled by Nicholas Cooper. Ariel Chobaz & Gelly Kusuma recorded and mixed \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" with assistance from Jon Sher at Conway Studios and Beluga Heights Studio, both studios in Los Angeles. Musically, \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" is an introspective mid- tempo ballad that contains an upbeat piano, synth beats, and features influences of bubblegum pop. The song is written in the key of E minor with a moderate pop tempo of 84 beats per minute. It follows the chord progression Em‚àíC2 (no 3)‚àíG‚àíD, and Minaj's vocals span two octaves from G3 to D5. Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is mentioned numerous times throughout the song, including the quote \\"I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.\\" However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as \\"it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it.\\" Release and reception \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" was first leaked in February 2012. On May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking fans to choose the next single(s). The poll was divided into three categories: The first category asked fans to choose between \\"Marilyn Monroe\\", \\"Fire Burns\\", \\"Young Forever\\", and \\"Gun Shot\\". \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" had the most votes and won the poll; \\"Young Forever\\" came in second, \\"Fire Burns\\" came in third, and \\"Gun Shot\\" came in fourth. When asked whether \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" would become a single during an interview with The Guardian, Minaj replied: \\"It has to be. It will be. We wanted to do it now, but then UK radio started playing 'Va Va Voom'. We're definitely going to have 'Marilyn Monroe' top of [2013], and we're going to spend quality time on the video. We're going to take care of that one.\\" \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" received mostly positive reviews. Andrew Hampp of Billboard gave the song a positive review, but felt the song was too similar to the JoJo song \\"Disaster\\", adding that \\"Of the three mid-tempo pop cuts on the album, 'Marilyn Monroe' stands the best chance of pop crossover.\\" Andy Gill of The Independent called it one of the most impressive songs on the pop half of the album and also encouraged fans to download it. BBC's Al Fox gave the song a positive review, praising \\"Young Forever\\" and \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" for displaying the same \\"tender vulnerabilities\\" of Minaj's breakthrough anthem \\"Your Love\\", saying that it is \\"a necessary and successful respite in an album so boastful\\". Slant Magazine negatively compared \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" to the works of pop star Demi Lovato. Live performances Minaj performed the song on select dates of her debut concert tour, the Pink Friday Tour. She also added the song to her set list for her Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour.

Founded in 1884 by Emily Malbone Morgan in the United States, the Society welcomes women from any church with whom the Episcopal Church is in communion: the Anglican Communion, the Moravian Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ECLA). Companions are called to live under a rule of intercessory prayer, thanksgiving, and simplicity of life, seeking to live a life of obedience to Christ in the company of others. Connected to one another by the Companion Prayer Chain and the Intercession Paper sent to all Companions monthly, we focus our prayers on the needs of individuals and families known to Companions around the world as well as on our concerns for the unity of all God‚Äôs people, God‚Äôs mission in the world, social justice, and peace and reconciliation. The life of the Society revolves around 35 chapters in the United States and India, as well as the Society‚Äôs retreat and conference center, Adelynrood, in Byfield, Massachusetts. Companions organize regional and national conferences on an array of topics from spiritual direction to interfaith collaboration for peace and social justice. The Society broke new ground in engaging women of diverse nations and contexts through the 2014 Anglican Women at Prayer conference.Anglican Women at Prayer website Companions are now exploring ways to use the Internet to foster prayer and friendship across the world. Many women have first come to know about the Society through reading about the lives and work of two of our early leaders, Emily Malbone Morgan and Vida Dutton Scudder who are part of the Episcopal calendar of saints in Holy Women, Holy Men. History In 1884, Emily Malbone Morgan, inspired by her invalid friend, Adelyn Howard, drew up rules and aims for daily use by a group of women envisioned as Companions of the Holy Cross. Later that year, seven women under the leadership of Miss Morgan organized themselves as the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross. Drawn to monastic practice like many Episcopal women of their time, the Companions developed a unique vocation for active lives in the secular world, grounding their work for social justice in daily prayer. Early Companions included several leaders in the settlement house movement. Renowned Christian socialist Vida Dutton Scudder helped to shape the ministries of generations of Companions as Companion-in-Charge of Probationers for thirty-five years. The Society expanded as Companions founded chapters throughout the United States. Chapter meetings and SCHC conferences created vital opportunities for prayer, discernment and mutual support as Companions aided each other to deepen their faith in Christ and apply it to enduring problems such as labor and race relations. Companions soon developed and continue to share a monthly Intercession Paper (or IP) organized around a daily cycle of prayers on the Aims of the Society. Chapters take turns providing the intercessions for each day of the week. Many of the prayers are written by contemporary Companions on current events. By 1915, the Companions completed the construction of Adelynrood,Adelynrood website a shingled house in Byfield, Massachusetts, with libraries and places to pray nestled throughout its three floors and quiet gardens. Adelynrood is the Society‚Äôs center for conferences and retreats [link to current program list], many of them open to the public. Companions design and lead many programs and also draw speakers such as the Rt. Rev. Steven Charleston and Presiding Bishop Michael Curry. Although the Society does not take a corporate stance on issues of peace and justice, individual Companions work to eradicate poverty, to bring justice to immigrants, to abolish the death penalty, and to bring attention to environmental concerns. Adelynrood Each summer at Adelynrood, the Society offers men and women silent retreats, quiet days, and study programs on spiritual, religious, educational, and social justice topics. Adelynrood also has private rooms available for individuals and small groups seeking a peaceful respite from daily responsibilities. The Society provides outreach programs to a range of organizations as part of its commitment to social justice. Homeless people, health caregivers, youth ministries, and families of deployed members of the military are among the groups served by this ministry. In addition, religious and educational groups may rent conference space for retreats or workshops year-round. Adelynrood is largely volunteer-run and Companions support the Society‚Äôs corporate ministry as celebrants, sacristans, hostesses, librarians, gardeners, musicians, and program coordinators. Organization and leadership An elected Companion-in- Charge and elected or appointed officers and committees oversee the operations, programs and outreach of the Society and Adelynrood with support from a small professional staff.

The bulk of her career was spent as the honorary keeper (curator) of Greek antiquities at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum from 1920 to 1958, and the Fitzwilliam Museum states that she was a \\"generous benefactor ... raising the profile of the collections through groundbreaking research, acquisitions and publications.\\"Fitzwilliam Museum Antiquities She directed archaeological excavations in Greece and Turkey; was a founding member of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara; and was the author of numerous books on Greek and Roman antiquities, including the 1929 publication Greek and Roman Bronzes, which was standard reading for studies on the subject. Early life and education Lamb was born on 3 November 1894 at Holly Lodge, Campden Hill, London. She was the daughter of Edmund Lamb, who was a Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1910, and Mabel Lamb (n√©e Winkworth), an alumna of Newnham College, Cambridge, who was active in the promotion of women's university education and women's suffrage. Lamb was educated at home by governesses and tutors, and from 1913 to 1917 attended Newnham College, Cambridge, studying Classics with a specialisation in Classical Archaeology, and earning first- class marks (although at this point women could not receive degrees from Cambridge). While a student she participated in archaeological fieldwork at prehistoric sites near Cambridge led by Thomas McKenny Hughes; she was also active in politics, attending meetings of the Union of Democratic Control.  Intelligence work during World War I  After completing her studies in the summer of 1917, Lamb worked in a hospital for soldiers. In January 1918, she joined 'Room 40', the cryptanalysis section of the British Naval Intelligence Department, where she probably worked on the decipherment of coded messages sent to German submarines, leaving after the end of the war, in December 1918. It was here that Lamb met John Beazley, a renowned archaeologist also working in British Intelligence, who encouraged her in her research. During this time she also attended sales of antiquities, publishing an article in the Journal of Hellenic Studies on a collection of vases she purchased in one sale, as well as carrying out some cataloguing work in the British Museum.  Fitzwilliam Museum  Lamb began working at the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge in October 1918, at the invitation of Sydney Cockrell: her initial duties included writing labels for items on display. In 1920, she was appointed as Honorary Keeper (Curator) of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the Fitzwilliam; in this position, she arranged new displays (including the creation of displays focusing on prehistoric and Cycladic material), sorted and catalogued the collections, and enhanced them by acquiring new materials through purchases and donations, as well as donating numerous items herself (especially bronzes and pottery). Key publications from her work at the Fitzwilliam include a book on Greek and Roman bronze statues and two volumes of the Corpus vasorum antiquorum (corpus of ancient vases). Throughout her time at the Fitzwilliam, Lamb also worked as an archaeologist in Greece and later Turkey. By the time she retired from the role of Honorary Keeper in August 1958, she had become one of the museum's greatest benefactors of Greek and Roman antiquities.  Excavations in Greece  Lamb first visited Greece in May 1920, briefly joining the excavations at Mycenae led by Alan Wace.David W. J. Gill. Anatolian Studies. Vol. 50, (2000)Preview She was admitted to the British School at Athens as a student for the academic year of 1920-1921, and spent the year visiting archaeological sites in Attica, the Peloponnese, and Crete, attending lectures in the British School and other archaeological schools, and working on the frescoes found at Mycenae. In May 1921 she joined the Mycenae excavation team and was made responsible for the excavation of the palace as well as for the publication of the frescoes. In the next excavation season, May‚ÄìJune 1922, Lamb was appointed as second-in-command of the dig, with particular responsibility for excavating the tombs near the settlement, and co-authored many of the excavation reports with Wace. Lamb next joined the British School's excavation at Sparta in spring 1924, and subsequently excavated with W.A. Heurtley in northern Greece, at the site Vardaroftsa near Thessaloniki in 1926 and at Sar√°tse in 1929. From 1928, she began looking for her own site to direct excavations; her work in northern Greece, with a focus on the links between the southern Balkans, the northern Aegean, and northwest Anatolia, led her to explore the island of Lesbos in the eastern Aegean. After a trial excavation at Methymna, where she found evidence of occupation from at least the seventh century BCE until the Roman period, she and her colleague Richard Wyatt Hutchinson identified prehistoric pottery at the site of Thermi. Lamb led excavations on this site from 1929 to 1933, largely funded at her own expense, discovering a series of prehistoric settlements. She visited the archaeological excavation of Troy in 1930 and 1932, which inspired further work, allowing her to associate Thermi towns IV and V with Troy IIa, and gave a lecture, expanding on these views, as part of the 1936 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts on British Archaeological Discoveries in Greece and Crete 1886‚Äì1936.David W. J. Gill, A Rich and Promising Site: Winifred Lamb (1894‚Äì1963), Kusura and Anatolian archaeology in Anatolian Studies, Vol 50 (2000) pp1-10 Lamb published her results from Thermi as a book in 1936 ‚Äì for which she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree from Cambridge in 1940, examined by V. Gordon Childe and Carl Blegen ‚Äì and provided a selection of finds from the dig to the Fitzwilliam Museum's prehistoric gallery. She subsequently conducted excavations at Antissa (1931‚Äì33; also on Lesbos), where she discovered prehistoric, archaic, classical, and Hellenistic settlements and burials, and at the archaic sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios at Kato Phano on Chios (1934).  Excavations in Turkey  Lamb's archaeological work on Lesbos had focused on links between Thermi and Troy; after this, she turned her attention to ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey), following in the footsteps of other women archaeologists, including Gertrude Bell, Margaret Hardie, and Dorothy Lamb (no relation), who had excavated there before the war. Lamb selected the site of Kusura, conducting a trial excavation in 1935 with Elinor W. Gardner and full excavations in 1936 and 1937 with James Rivers Barrington Stewart, Eleanor Mary Barrington Stewart, Rachel Maxwell-Hyslop, R.H. Macartney, and Nine Six; as well as excavating the cemetery, finds included a cult site and pottery relating to Troy VI. Lamb presented her findings in a lecture to the Society of Antiquaries in London on 'Recent developments in the prehistory of Anatolia' in 1937, pointing out Kusura's location on a major Bronze Age route between central Anatolia and the Aegean. A second lecture to the Society of Antiquaries in 1938 similarly emphasized Kusura's relationships with both of these areas. Lamb also published the Anatolian material held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. She felt that more excavation was required in Anatolia, but her work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Lamb was a founding member of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, whose creation was initiated in 1946 by John Garstang, and served as its honorary secretary from its formal opening in 1948 until 1957, when she resigned from this role and took on the position of vice president.Getzel M. Cohen, Martha Sharp Joukowsky. Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists. University of Michigan 2004. Her work for the BIAA included a programme for the BBC on the Institute and Turkish archaeology, broadcast shortly after the BIAA's creation in 1948; a review of the development of Anatolian archaeology, especially work published in Turkish and German; and a project on the cultures of north-eastern Anatolia in the third millennium BCE, conducted at Erzerum and Trabzon in 1952 and published in 1954.  BBC work during World War II  In late 1941 Lamb joined the BBC's European Intelligence Unit as a Greek language supervisor, and was probably responsible for an intelligence report of 17 November 1941 relating to BBC broadcasts to Greece and the Greek resistance to the German occupation. In January 1942 she transferred to the Near Eastern Department's Turkish section, where she continued to work until 1946: her responsibilities included preparing bi-monthly intelligence reports on Turkish radio services and newspapers, and briefing Turkish journalists based in London; she also worked on reports relating to Iran and Arabic- speaking countries. In October 1944 Lamb was seriously injured when a V2 rocket hit her lodgings in north London and required a long period of recuperation, returning to work in late April 1945; following the end of the war she resigned from the BBC in February 1946.  Later life  Lamb retired from her post at the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1958, having become one of the museum's greatest benefactors of Greek and Roman antiquities. She continued to be involved with the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, but from 1959 her health deteriorated, often preventing her from attending meetings of the Institute. She died of a stroke on 16 September 1963 in the Cottage Hospital at Easebourne.  Selected publications   Books  *Greek and Roman Bronzes (Argonaut, 1929) *Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain.

The company developed many long-haul fiber optic communications network routes throughout North America, many along railroad rights of way, consisting of both dark fiber and lit fiber. These long-haul routes included Chicago to New Orleans, Chicago to Denver, Chicago to Detroit, Chicago to New York, Seattle to Los Angeles, and Denver to San Francisco. In 2011, the company was acquired by Zayo Group. History The company was founded as Pacific Fiber Link, L.L.C. on February 5, 1998 as a subsidiary of Ledcor Industries of Canada, a member of the Ledcor Group of Companies, owned by the Lede family. It commenced business operations on May 31, 1998. As the fiber optic telecommunications industry boomed, one of the greatest impediments to rapid growth for the telecoms was the acquisition of the rights of way within which to lay the fiber optic cables. The Ledes came up with a solution to this problem and negotiated a deal with the Canadian National Railway to install the cable in the railroad's rights of way alongside the tracks. The company made significant contributions to the linear construction industry by inventing and patenting the Railplow, that is mounted on a flatbed railcar and used to rapidly excavate a trench alongside railroad tracks, install conduits used for housing fiber optic cables, then backfilling the trench and completing the construction and installation process within a very short span of time. This technology enabled 360networks to rapidly lay out a North American fiber optic network throughout Canada and the United States along and within numerous railroad rights of way. The patent for the Railplow was transferred to a subsidiary of the two companies and 360networks received a royalty-free, exclusive license for the use of the Railplow, giving it a significant advantage over some of its competitors that also utilized rail corridors. Initially, the company focused on building a fiber optic route from Seattle to Sacramento. In 1999, it changed its name to Worldwide Fiber Networks, Inc. and its focus toward a global network. In 2000, the company changed its name to 360networks Inc., and its United States entity to 360networks (USA)inc., to better describe its 360-degree focus on a global network. It hired Greg Maffei, the former chief financial officer of Microsoft, as its new chief executive officer of the company and received private equity investments from Michael Dell, Nathan Myhrvold, Liberty Media, and News Corp. During the dot-com bubble, on January 2, 2000, the company undertook its initial public offering, raising C$2.4 billion (US$1.45 billion) and giving the company a market capitalization of C$20.6 billion. and its stock was traded on the NASDAQ in the United States under the ticker TSIX, and on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada under the ticker, TSX. In May 2000, the company acquired 1 million square feet of space to house computer networking equipment in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas for $144 million in cash and stock. In August 2000, the company acquired 11,000 miles of fiber optic infrastructure from Call-Net Enterprises Incorporated for $162.5 million. In November 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $13 billion, despite only $234 million in revenue for the first six months of 2000. In May 2001, the company received a license to own infrastructure in Japan. In early June 2001, the company skipped a debt payment. On June 28, 2001, the company filed bankruptcy in Canada and the United States. In October 2002, WL Ross & Co acquired 12.5% of the company. In November 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy. The company also acquired Group Telecom. In May 2003, the company acquired the U.S. communications business of Dynegy. In November 2003, the company sold assets to Qwest.

Chicago, 394 U.S. 111 (1969), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court overturned the disorderly conduct charges against Dick Gregory and others for peaceful demonstrations in Chicago..  Background  Social activists, including comedian Dick Gregory, protested against school segregation in Chicago, Illinois in 1969. Twelve years earlier, in Brown v. Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled school segregation unconstitutional. The protesters marched from Chicago's city hall to the mayor's residence. After concluding the march, bystanders began to act unruly, and police asked the protesters to disperse. The protesters did not disperse and were consequently arrested, and subsequently convicted by a jury, of violating Chicago's disorderly conduct ordinance. The protesters appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court. That court upheld their conviction, holding that the protesters' refusal to obey the police order justified the convictions.City of Chicago v. Gregory, 392d 47, 233 N.E.2d 422 (1968). Aided by the ACLU, the protesters appealed to the US Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The US Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, overturned the conviction for several reasons: * \\"Petitioners were denied due process since there was no evidence to support their convictions\\" * \\"The convictions were for demonstrating, not for refusing to obey police orders.\\" * \\"The trial judge's charge allowed the jury to convict for acts protected by the First Amendment.

Rickerby (1921‚Äì1972) was an American photographer whose most famous works are his sports photography, especially his color photography essays, and his photographs of the Kennedy administration. His work is most noted for its realism and pioneering use of the 35 mm camera and the early zoom lens. Rickerby was born on March 15, 1921, in New York City, and died in 1972 at the age of 51 in Danbury, Connecticut. He attended Duke University and worked as a photojournalist. He was married three times, most recently to Wanda A. Rickerby, and had three children: Arthur Jr., Bradford, and David. Life Youth Arthur B. Rickerby was born in 1921 in Manhattan, New York. His father died when Rickerby was only a toddler. He grew up in the Bronx and attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he took up photography in the hopes of pleasing his botany teacher, who was the faculty leader of the club. The photography club was where he developed his affinity for the art. After high school, Rickerby attended Duke University, majoring in political science and government. To help pay his way through school, he took photographs of Duke's victorious sports teams and sold them to local papers. Rickerby's photographs were picked up by ACME publishing (later UPI) for their national coverage of Duke University sports, which started his career. Navy After graduating from Duke, Rickerby joined the US Navy, serving as Lieutenant, Senior Grade, in Captain Edward Steichen's Navy photography unit in World War II. He covered many major events in the Pacific, including \\"airstrikes on Tokyo and ... the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa\\". He also photographed the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri. As characterized by his later work, he often shot intimate experiences such as at-sea burials and the lives of Japanese prisoners of war in Guam. Rickerby was promoted to Captain before he left the Navy. Career When he returned to civilian life, Rickerby was invited by ACME/UPI to join its staff. Here he covered China's, Japan's, and Germany's post-war redevelopment, among other projects, which included sports events. It was at this time that he began his use of the 35 mm camera and an early version of the zoom lens, taking arguably his most famous photograph in 1956, that of Don Larsen, of the Yankees, in his record-breaking no-hitter World Series game. Later, Rickerby had a chance to host a \\"Photography Tour of the Orient\\" in 1958 for Pan American while on vacation from UPI. In 1959, Rickerby decided to leave UPI to explore different opportunities as a freelance photographer. His photographs appeared in such notable publications as Sports Illustrated, Sport, and Look, among others. In the 1960s, his photographs appeared in the series \\"The Face of America\\" in the Saturday Evening Post. LIFE magazine hired Rickerby in 1961 to cover the Kennedy administration. Rickerby photographed John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office and covered Jacqueline Kennedy's public life, which included her historic trip to India and Pakistan. On the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Rickerby rode in the President's motorcade. His most famous photograph from the day of the assassination is of the vice president's limousine outside Parkland Hospital; inside the open limousine, Lady Bird Johnson‚Äôs abandoned bouquet of roses lay scattered. Rickerby was later assigned to photograph John F. Kennedy's funeral. Although LIFE brought him on to cover the Kennedy administration, he continued to cover sporting events, including the Olympics. Rickerby was particularly renowned for his Yankees photographs and his color essays on football. He was also assigned diverse projects such as Queen Elizabeth II's tour of Canada, Nikita Khrushchev's tour across the United States, the Boston Strangler scare, and the trials of Jimmy Hoffa. Five of his photographs made LIFE magazine's cover, including a two- page pullout cover showcasing his color essay \\"Pro football mayhem: Green Bay Packers and Cleveland Browns\\"; this color essay became one of his most famous works. In 1972, LIFE magazine ceased weekly publication and Rickerby was taken off staff and made a contract photographer. Between 1973 and 1977, LIFE published sporadically, averaging two issues a year. In 1978, it began monthly publication. In the 1970s, Rickerby continued to shoot contract assignments for LIFE while freelancing for other publications. His last assignments for LIFE magazine were color coverage of Willie Mays's transition from the San Francisco Giants to the New York Mets on May 26, 1972, and photographs of Doug Rader with the Houston Astros on June 16, 1972. Arthur B. Rickerby died in August 1972. Non-photographic contributions In the 1960s, Arthur B. Rickerby moved to Bethel, Connecticut, and became an active member of and advocate for his community. Rickerby was well known in his town not only for his photography, but also his work on the ABC for Proper Zoning Committee, to which he was elected in November 1971. He was also co-founder and chairman of the Fairfield-Litchfield Environmental Council (FLEC). Both these committees were dedicated to protecting the town's environment, health and esthetic. At various times he was also a member of the Bethel Hills Civic Association and the American Field Service. Dedicated to his town, Rickerby led a successful fight against constructing a 71-mile power line through the Bethel area, which led to the foundation of the Connecticut State Power Facilities Evaluation Council. The extent of his contributions to his community can be seen in the Arthur Rickerby Memorial Award, which was given at the Housatonic Valley Regional High School in Falls Village by the Environmental Commission on behalf of the Ecology League, Inc. Death Arthur B. Rickerby died from pancreatitis in 1972. Despite his extensive photojournalism and good reputation at the time of his death, his work was lost in the vacuum of LIFE magazine's collapse. According to Rickerby's widow, Wanda A. Rickerby, most of the LIFE photographers attended his funeral and the largest flower arrangement was from Teamsters' Union Local No. 5 of Baton Rouge, whose business agent was a key witness against Jimmy Hoffa in the trials that Rickerby covered. Contributions and influence Quick to embrace new technologies, Arthur B. Rickerby managed to take his most famous photograph by pioneering the use of the 35 mm camera and early zoom lens. These innovations helped Rickerby pursue his esthetic of up-close and personal photography. His dedication to a more flexible camera and the pursuit of a more natural photojournalism garnered him a nomination for a Pulitzer Prize.

In 1957, he earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for 35 mm pioneering and use of the early zoom lens, in particular the photo of Don Larsen pitching the only perfect game in World Series history with the scoreboard in the background. Works Notable photographs Overall, Rickerby is most famous for his sports photography, especially his color essays, and his portraits of the Kennedy administration. The most famous photograph he published was that of Yankees pitcher Don Larsen pitching the first-ever perfect World series game. His most famous color essay was \\"the Violence of the Pros\\" for LIFE magazine.

A Member of the International Consortium of Stem Cell Networks, the foundation is committed to the pursuit of international cooperation, collaboration and excellence in the stem cell field. __TOC__ Background The Irish Stem Cell Foundation is a non-profit organization. It was established in Dublin in October 2009, and is composed of doctors, researchers, patient advocates, science communicators, solicitors, teachers and students. The foundation's objectives are described as: * Accelerate Stem Cell Research to cure major illnesses and injury. * Provide a focus on education in all areas of stem cell research and therapy. * Establish a forum to promote, foster and exchange accurate information on the progress of stem cell research to all interested parties. * It also seeks to have appropriate legislation and improve current governance to make Irish Medical Research more competitive internationally and to educate and thus reduce risk to the Irish patient. The Chief Scientific Officer of the Foundation is Dr Stephen Sullivan The Chief Medical Officer of the Foundation is Professor Orla Hardiman. The foundation has engaged the international and domestic media on the topic of stem cell tourism, where patients are scammed by unregulated clinics making medically and scientifically unsubstantiated claims to patients over the internet. Such experimental protocols endanger patients' lives and harm the reputation of legitimate stem cell research and clinical trials (which are tightly regulated). The foundation agrees with the Irish Council Of Bioethics and the Irish Committee for Assisted Human Reproduction that Irish stem cell research needs a strong, transparent ethical and legislative structure. In 2010, the Foundation issued a public policy document on embryonic stem cell research. In 2012 the Irish Stem Cell Foundation hosted its second conference, the Irish Stem Cell Summit, in Dublin. The Summit focused on the underdevelopment of Irish policy and law pertaining to stem cells, and the detrimental effect this has on the quality of research in the area, as well as the damage this is doing to public trust, international investment and collaboration. In 2013, the Foundation led a campaign with other Irish medical research charities to question the wisdom of abolishing Ireland's independent Chief Scientific Adviser. More recently, the Foundation joined with the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK to urge the European Parliament to maintain funding for European stem cell research. The Irish Stem Cell Foundation is not affiliated with the lobby group calling itself 'The Adult Stem Cell Foundation of Ireland'. The Irish Stem Cell Foundation supports all types of stem cell research governed by an open and transparent ethics structure. This position is consistent with those formulated by several other Irish groups including The Commission for Assisted Human Reproduction, The Irish Council of Bioethics, and The Irish Patients Association.

From the late 1990 onward he became a prime mover of new German theater, pioneering the combination of live action and videoprojection in innovative ways, while firmly grounding his plays on philosophical concepts. He pays particular attention to issues relating to problems of morality, human identity, the individual and his relation to society. His work often addresses controversial subjects, either directly or by implication.Frei, Nikolaus (2006).

He founded Project PM, a research collaboration and wiki, to facilitate analysis of the troves of hacked emails and other leaked information concerning the inner workings of the cyber-military-industrial complex. In January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison for the crimes of accessory after the fact, obstruction of justice, and threatening a federal officer stemming from the FBI's investigation into the 2012 Stratfor email leak. Prosecutors had previously brought other charges associated with his sharing of an HTTP link to the leaked Stratfor data, but those charges were dropped in 2014. As part of his sentence, Brown was also required to pay almost $900,000 to Stratfor. Prior to 2011, Brown had ties with the hacktivist collective Anonymous. Early life and education Brown was born in Dallas, Texas, to Robert Brown and Karen Lancaster, who later divorced. He grew up in Dallas and exhibited an early interest in writing and journalism, creating his own newspapers on his family's computer while attending Preston Hollow Elementary School.Rogers, Tim. \\"Barrett Brown is Anonymous.\\" D Magazine. April 2011. Retrieved on May 30, 2014. He went on to contribute to his school newspapers, and interned at several weekly newspapers during his teenage years. He attended the Episcopal School of Dallas through his sophomore year of high school, then spent his would-be junior year in Tanzania with his father who was residing there on business. While in Africa, Brown completed high school online through a Texas Tech University program, earning college credits as well as his high school diploma. In 2000 he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin and spent two semesters taking writing courses before leaving school to pursue a full-time career as a freelance writer. Journalism Brown served as the director of communications for Enlighten the Vote, a secularist PAC that provides financial and strategic assistance to political candidates that advocate strict enforcement of the Establishment Clause. In 2010, Brown began work on his crowdsourced investigation wiki, Project PM. Brown has written that the main goals of Project PM are to increase the positive influence of what he calls \\"the more capable segments of the blogosphere\\", while reducing the negative influence of well-regarded mainstream pundits, who may have political agendas not compatible with public interest. It was his aim that the wiki Project PM be established by way of the deliberate generation of critical mass of work and following among dependable bloggers in such a manner as that segments of the traditional media will be prompted or even forced to address critical issues in their own methods and means of reportage. A further and experimental aim of Project PM is also to develop a communicational schematic which could provide bloggers, reporters and any other concerned Citizen journalist with the best possible feed of raw information by which to produce content. On the aim of Project PM, Brown has stated: > The institutions and structures that have developed over the past two > decades of accelerating public internet use have had what we reasonably > describe as a wholesome effect on information flow. But the information age > is a work in progress, and thus there are potential improvements to be made. > More importantly, there are improvements that can be made by an initially > small number of influential participants working in coordination. The > purpose of Project PM is to implement these solutions to the extent that > participants are collectively able to do so, as well as to demonstrate the > beneficial effects of these solutions to others that they might be spurred > to recreate or even build upon them independently of our own efforts. In June 2011, he and Project PM released an exclusive report about a surveillance contract called \\"Romas/COIN\\" which was discovered in e-mails hacked from HBGary by Anonymous. It consisted of sophisticated data-mining techniques leveraging mobile software and aimed at Arab countries. In November 2011, Brown said that 75 names of members of the Zetas drug cartel would be released if a member of the Anonymous group who had been kidnapped was not set free. Brown says the member was then released and that there was a truce between him and the drug cartel for the moment. Others have said the kidnapping was fake. On January 18, 2012, Brown was interviewed by the English language Russian news network RT about the cyber attacks by Anonymous and the temporary blackout of the US government websites WhiteHouse.Gov, DoJ.gov and FBI.gov. On March 6, 2012, he confirmed on Twitter that the FBI raided his residence after receiving information from Hector Xavier Monsegur (also known by the online pseudonym Sabu), the founder of LulzSec. In early January 2014, it was announced that his second book, begun in 2006, will be published. According to his legal defense website > The book was originally titled Hot, Fat, and Clouded: The Amazing and > Amusing Failures of America‚Äôs Chattering Class and consisted of his attack > on the ubiquitous newspaper columnists and media pundits whom he argues are > undeservedly influential and able to form public opinion. ‚Ä¶ We are excited > to announce that we have rescued the book from its fate and that it will > soon see the light of day. Newly titled as Keep Rootin‚Äô for Putin: > Establishment Pundits and the Twilight of American Competence, the text > become available as an eBook in the spring of 2014 for donors to his legal > defense fund. From September 2012, during his incarceration, Brown wrote a series of columns for D Magazine titled \\"The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Jail\\". In 2015 he transitioned from D to The Intercept. In 2016 The Intercept won a National Magazine Award for three of Barrett's columns. Brown has written for The Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/31/my-post- cyberpunk-indentured-servitude.htmlVanity Fair, True/Slant, The Huffington Post, The Guardian, Skeptical Inquirer, and other publications. Association with Anonymous Some media outlets have presented Brown as a spokesperson for Anonymous, which he disputes as libel. Brown has said he renounced his links with the group in 2011. Arrest and trial On March 6, 2012, the FBI executed search warrants at Brown's apartment and his mother's house seeking evidence of alleged crimes. The items to be seized included \\"Records relating to HBGary, Infragard, Endgame Systems, Anonymous, LulzSec, IRC Chats, Twitter, wiki.echelon2.org, and pastebin.com.\\" Agents took possession of his laptop computers. \\"I suspect that the FBI is working off of incorrect information,\\" Brown told a reporter. On September 12, 2012, Brown was arrested in Dallas County, Texas for threatening an FBI agent in a YouTube video. His arrest occurred as he left a computer linked to Tinychat in which the raid could be heard in the background. Brown has talked publicly about his history of using heroin and he was going through withdrawal on the day of his arrest. A magistrate denied bail, and therefore he was kept in pre-trial detention, because he was \\"a danger to the safety of the community and a risk of flight.\\" On September 24, 2012, a Pastebin post appeared titled \\"Barrett Brown ‚Äì Communiqu√© from Prison 9/20/12\\", in which Brown thanked supporters, described the insufficient medical treatment he received after having his ribs injured during his arrest, and acknowledged some past mistakes. The missive concludes, \\"I will personally thank everyone on the outside who has helped me and this movement particularly at this critical time, when I have regained the freedom that I did nothing to lose. For now, and until that time, it is war, on paper as always, but war.\\" On October 3, 2012, a federal grand jury indictment was returned against Brown on charges of threats, conspiracy and retaliation against a federal law enforcement officer. Various tweets, YouTube uploads and comments made by Brown before his arrest were cited as support within the indictment. He later entered a plea of not guilty to all three counts. On December 4, 2012, Brown was indicted on an additional 12 federal charges related to the December 25, 2011 hack of Austin-based private intelligence company Stratfor carried out by Jeremy Hammond. A trove of millions of Stratfor emails from the hack, including authentication information for thousands of credit card accounts, was shared by the hacker collective LulzSec with whistleblower site WikiLeaks (main article: 2012 Stratfor email leak). While Hammond pleaded guilty and received the maximum sentence of ten years in federal prison for the hack itself, Brown faced up to 45 years in federal prison for allegedly sharing a link to the data as part of Project PM, after a presumed FBI entrapment maneuver.) Attorney Jesselyn Radack has raised connections between Brown's case, and that of her client Peter Van Buren, whom the State Department sought to prosecute over a link on his personal blog to a Wikileaks document. Two online commentators on internet security issues criticized the charges against Brown. He entered a plea of not guilty to all twelve counts. On January 23, 2013, a third indictment was filed against Brown on two counts of obstruction for concealing evidence during the March 6, 2012 FBI raid of his and his mother's homes. During a brief court hearing a week later, a judge found him mentally competent to stand trial, while Brown again pleaded not guilty to the additional charges. On May 1, 2013, it was announced that Brown had retained two attorneys, Charles Swift and Ahmed Ghappour, to represent him in his legal cases. As of September 4, 2013, Brown was under a federal court-issued gag order; he and his lawyers were not allowed to discuss his case with the media, lest it taint a jury. Assistant United States Attorney Candina S. Heath (the lead prosecutor) said that Brown tried to manipulate the media from behind bars for his benefit, that Brown's attorney \\"coordinates and/or approves of his use of the media,\\" and that most of the publicity about Brown has contained false information and \\"gross fabrications\\". Defense counsel maintained the gag order was an unfounded and unwarranted breach of Brown's First Amendment rights. Though forbidden to write or speak out about his case, Brown continued to pen articles from his prison cell on unrelated topics. The gag order was lifted on April 23, 2014, and key documents were unsealed. Brown had been in custody since September 12, 2012. His mother was sentenced on November 8, 2013, to six months of probation and a $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor charge of obstructing the execution of a search warrant. \\"My better judgment was clouded by my maternal instinct,\\" she stated in court. The judge said to her, \\"I feel for you, as a parent. I know you did the best you could.\\" In March 2014, most charges against Brown were dropped. In April 2014, it was reported that Brown had agreed to a plea bargain. In January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay $890,250 in fines and restitution. Journalist Janus Kopfstein said she believed the government considered Brown to be a threat and suggested that prosecutors made false allegations that were used to increase the length of his sentence. Supporting this theory, much of Brown's December sentencing hearing was spent in drawn-out arguments over the definitions of Project PM and Brown himself. Brown was released from prison on November 29, 2016, and moved into a halfway house with five drug dealers close to downtown Dallas, Texas. On April 27, 2017, Brown was arrested and held on unknown charges for four days. After he was released, he gave an interview to Democracy Now! while under house arrest, despite pressure from the government not to speak to the media. Brown has expressed a desire to move to Iceland or Germany when possible, telling Truthout in an interview, \\"I can't stay in the US because I can't get work done if I'm always subject to these little gusts of bureaucracy, which I am. It won't be for another year or so. I'm on probation for another two years. That generally goes down to one year if you don't act up. So in a year from now I'll be in a position to leave.\\"  Surveillance of contacts and sympathizers  In 2017, lawyers for donors to Brown's legal fund filed suit against Assistant United States Attorney Candina Heath for filing a subpoena against WePay that resulted in divulgence of their identities. The lawyers argued that the irrelevance of donor information to the case against Brown and the provision of the information directly to Special Agent Robert Smith of the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than to the prosecutor or judge in the trial led to donors' belief that the information was intended to surveil and harass the donors for activity protected by the U.S. constitution, and filed for destruction of the data and monetary damages. On October 2, 2017, Judge Maria Elena James denied a motion to dismiss the case introduced by the Department of Justice. In his sentencing statement, Brown alleged that, despite the denial of a subpoena by the judge to which he was making the statement, the identities of all contributors to the echelon2.org public Wiki had been obtained \\"by other means\\", and that \\"now the dozens of people who have given their time and expertise to what has been hailed by journalists and advocacy groups as a crucial journalistic enterprise are now at risk of being indicted under the same sort of spurious charges that I was facing not long ago, when the government exposed me to decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link to a publicly available file that other journalists were also linking to without being prosecuted.\\" In the press and the arts Relatively Free is a documentary film released in 2016 by Field of Vision about Brown's drive across Texas to a halfway house after he was released from prison. Barrett Brown's case was included as a plot point in Season 2 of the U.S. TV series House of Cards. Brown serves on the advisory board of the International Modern Media Institute.

This article provides a brief overview of the health care systems of the world, sorted by continent.  Health care systems classification by country   Countries with universal government-funded health system In this system (also known as single-payer healthcare) government-funded healthcare is available to all citizens regardless of their income or employment status. Some countries may provide healthcare to non-citizen residents, while some may require them to buy private insurance: Countries with universal public insurance system In these countries workers have social insurance. Usually government withholds part of their wage, which is divided between employee and employer. People who don't have legal contract of employment and/or can't register as unemployed may be ineligible for free health care: Countries with universal public- private insurance system In this system some people receive healthcare via primary private insurance, while people who are ineligible for it, from government:  Countries with universal private health insurance system In this system people receive healthcare via mandatory private insurance, usually subsidised by the government for low-income citizens: Countries with non- universal insurance system In this system some citizens have private health insurance, some are eligible for subsidized public health care, while some are not insured at all: Africa Algeria When Algeria gained its independence from France in 1962, there were only around 300 doctors across the whole country and no proper system of healthcare. Over the next few decades, great progress was made in building up the health sector, with the training of doctors and the creation of many health facilities. Today, Algeria has an established network of hospitals (including university hospitals), clinics, medical centres and small health units or dispensaries. While equipment and medicines may not always be the latest available, staffing levels are high and the country has one of the best healthcare systems in Africa. Access to health care is enhanced by the requirement that doctors and dentists work in public health for at least five years. The government provides universal health care. Cape Verde Medical facilities in Cape Verde are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. There are hospitals in Praia and Mindelo, with smaller medical facilities in other places. The islands of Brava and Santo Ant√£o no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands. Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service.United States Department of State, \\"Cape Verde: Country Specific Information\\" Eritrea Eritrea is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for health. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified the high prioritisation of health and education both within the government and amongst Eritreans at home and abroad. Innovative multi-sectoral approaches to health were also identified with the success. About one-third of the population lives in extreme poverty, and more than half survives on less than US$1 per day. Health care and welfare resources generally are believed to be poor, although reliable information about conditions is often difficult to obtain. In 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the Eritrean government spent 5.7 percent of gross domestic product on national health accounts. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2004 there were only three physicians per 100,000 people in Eritrea. The two-year war with Ethiopia, coming on the heels of a 30-year struggle for independence, negatively affected the health sector and the general welfare. The rate of prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), in Eritrea is believed to be at 0.7%(2012)which is reasonably low. In the decade since 1995, impressive results have been achieved in lowering maternal and child mortality rates and in immunizing children against childhood diseases. In 2008 average life expectancy was slightly less than 63 years, according to the WHO. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995‚Äì2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). This has helped to some small extent even out rural-urban and rich-poor inequity in health. Ethiopia Throughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998‚Äì2000 war with Eritrea, but in the years since, outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000‚Äì2001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The physician to population ratio was 1:48,000, the nurse to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. These ratios have since shown some improvement. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varies from limited to nonexistent. As of the end of 2003, the United Nations (UN) reported that 4.4 percent of adults were infected with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS); other estimates of the rate of infection ranged from a low of 7 percent to a high of 18 percent. Whatever the actual rate, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has contributed to falling life expectancy since the early 1990s. According to the Ministry of Health, one-third of current young adult deaths are AIDS-related. Malnutrition is widespread, especially among children, as is food insecurity. Because of growing population pressure on agricultural and pastoral land, soil degradation, and severe droughts that have occurred each decade since the 1970s, per capita food production is declining. According to the UN and the World Bank, Ethiopia at present suffers from a structural food deficit such that even in the most productive years, at least 5 million Ethiopians require food relief. In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. A polio vaccination campaign for 14 million children has been carried out, and a program to resettle some 2 million subsistence farmers is underway. In November 2004, the government launched a five-year program to expand primary health care. In January 2005, it began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults. Ghana In Ghana, most health care is provided by the government, but hospitals and clinics run by religious groups also play an important role. Some for-profit clinics exist, but they provide less than 2% of health services. Health care is very variable through the country. The major urban centres are well served, but rural areas often have no modern health care. Patients in these areas either rely on traditional medicine or travel great distances for care. In 2005, Ghana spent 6.2% of GDP on health care, or US$30 per capita. Of that, approximately 34% was government expenditure. Guinea Guinea has been reorganizing its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987 formally promoted community- based methods of increasing accessibility of primary health care to the population, including community ownership and local budgeting, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of drugs and other essential health care resources.Knippenberg R et al. \\"Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea.\\" Int J Health Plann Manage. 1997 Jun;12 Suppl 1:S29-47. In June 2011, the Guinean government announced the establishment of an air ticket solidarity levy on all flights taking off from national soil, with funds going to UNITAID to support expanded access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.UNITAID. Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Geneva, 30 June 2011. Accessed 5 July 2011. Guinea is among the growing number of countries and development partners using market-based transactions taxes and other innovative financing mechanisms to expand financing options for health care in resource-limited settings. Mali Health in Mali, one of the world's poorest nations, is greatly affected by poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62‚Äì65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation's villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.Mali country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (January 2005). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Mali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. In 2001 general government expenditures on health constituted 6.8 percent of total general government expenditures and 4.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), totaling only about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate. Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, especially outside of Bamako, and medicines are in short supply. There were only 5 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants in the 1990s and 24 hospital beds per 100,000 in 1998. In 1999 only 36 percent of Malians were estimated to have access to health services within a five-kilometer radius. Morocco According to the United States government, Morocco has inadequate numbers of physicians (0.5 per 1,000 people) and hospital beds (1.0 per 1,000 people) and poor access to water (82 percent of the population) and sanitation (75 percent of the population). The health care system includes 122 hospitals, 2,400 health centers, and 4 university clinics, but they are poorly maintained and lack adequate capacity to meet the demand for medical care. Only 24,000 beds are available for 6 million patients seeking care each year, including 3 million emergency cases. The health budget corresponds to 1.1 percent of gross domestic product and 5.5 percent of the central government budget.Morocco country profile.

Niger Health care system of Niger suffers from a chronic lack of resources and a small number of health providers relative to population. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. There are government hospitals in Niamey (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the H√¥pital National de Niamey and the H√¥pital National De Lamord√©), Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns.REPUBLIC OF NIGER PRELIMINARY ATLAS OF POVERTY/VULNERABILITY. MAP 8: VILLAGES WITH CLINICS/HOSPITALS . Prepared for The World Bank Technical Department, Africa Region. 6 March 2001. Medical facilities are limited in both supplies and staff, with a small government health care system supplemented by private, charitable, religious, and Non- government organisation operated clinics and public health programs (such as Galmi Hospital near Birnin Konni and Maradi). Government hospitals, as well as public health programmes, fall under the control of the Nigerien Ministry of Health. A number of private for profit clinics (\\"Cabinets M√©dical Priv√©\\") operate in Niamey. The total expenditure on health per capita in 2005 was Intl $25. There were 377 Physicians in Niger in 2004, a ratio of 0.03 per 10,000 population. In 2003, 89.2 percent of individual expenditures on health care were \\"out-of-pocket\\" (paid by the patient).Niger. Country Health System Fact Sheet, 2006 . World Health Organization. Nigeria Health care provision in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country.Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264 However, because Nigeria operates a mixed economy, private providers of health care have a visible role to play in health care delivery. The federal government's role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the university teaching hospitals, while the state government manages the various general hospitals and the local government focus on dispensaries. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18 A long run indicator of the ability of the country to provide food sustenance and avoid malnutrition is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970 to 1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1‚Äì18 Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's importation of food products. Historically, health insurance in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: government-paid health care provided and financed for all citizens, health care provided by government through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101‚Äì102 However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the National Health Insurance Scheme, the scheme encompasses government employees, the organized private sector and the informal sector. Legislative wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of Nigeria', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415‚Äì427 Senegal The health budget in Senegal has tripled between 1980 and 2000, leading to the Senegalese people leading healthier and longer lives ‚Äì the life expectancy at birth is approximately 55.34 years for men, 58.09 years for women, and 56.69 years for the entire population. Also, the prevalence rate of AIDS in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at 0.9%. However, large disparities still exist in Senegal's health coverage, with 70% of doctors, and 80% of pharmacists and dentists, living in the nation's capital city, Dakar. South Africa In South Africa, parallel private and public systems exist. The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed. The wealthiest 20% of the population uses the private system and are far better served. This division in substantial ways perpetuates racial inequalities created in the pre-apartheid segregation era and apartheid era of the 20th century. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure. Sudan Outside urban areas, little health care is available in Sudan, helping account for a relatively low average life expectancy of 57 years and an infant mortality rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, low by standards in Middle Eastern but not African countries. For most of the period since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced civil war, which has diverted resources to military use that otherwise might have gone into health care and training of professionals, many of whom have migrated in search of more gainful employment. In 1996 the World Health Organization estimated that there were only 9 doctors per 100,000 people, most of them in regions other than the South. Substantial percentages of the population lack access to safe water and sanitary facilities. Malnutrition is widespread outside the central Nile corridor because of population displacement from war and from recurrent droughts; these same factors together with a scarcity of medicines make diseases difficult to control. Child immunization against most major childhood diseases, however, had risen to approximately 60 percent by the late 1990s from very low rates in earlier decades. Spending on health care is quite low ‚Äì only 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 (latest data). The United Nations placed the rate of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in late 2003 at 2.3 percent for adults, quite low by regional standards. The United Nations suggested, however, that the rate could be as high as 7.2 percent. Between 400,000 and 1.3 million adults and children were living with HIV, and AIDS deaths numbered 23,000. As of late 2004, some 4 million persons in the South had been internally displaced and more than 2 million had died or been killed as a result of two decades of war. Comparable figures for Darfur were 1.6 million displaced and 70,000 dead since fighting began there in early 2003.Sudan country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 2004).

Zimbabwe Zimbabwe now has one of the lowest life expectancies on Earth ‚Äì 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990. The rapid drop has been ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality has risen from 59 per thousand in the late 1990s to 123 per 1000 by 2004. The health system has more or less collapsed: By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working. Due to hyperinflation, those hospitals still open are not able to obtain basic drugs and medicines. The ongoing political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge. In August 2008, large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing cholera epidemic. Americas Argentina Argentina‚Äôs health care system is composed of three sectors: the public sector, financed through taxes; the private sector, financed through voluntary insurance schemes; and the social security sector, financed through obligatory insurance schemes. The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics. Argentina has three sectors. The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions. There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources for all Obras Sociales schemes and the monthly average a beneficiary receives varies from $5‚Äì80 per month.IDRC Reshaping Health Care in Latin Americahttp://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html . MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities. Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after Argentina's economic crisis of 2001, the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the informal sector rose). In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.Armando Barrientos \\"Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile\\" Health Policy and Planning 15(4): 420 The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines. Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors. According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign competition has increased in Argentina's private sector, with Swiss, American and other Latin American health care providers entering the market in recent years. This has been accompanied by little formal regulation. The public system serves those not covered by Obras Sociales or private insurance schemes. It also provides emergency services. According to above-mentioned IRBC report, Argentina's public system exhibits serious structural deterioration and managerial inefficiency; a high degree of administrative centralization at the provincial level; rigidity in its staffing structure and labour relationships; no adequate system of incentives; inadequate information systems on which to base decision-making and control; serious deficits in facilities and equipment maintenance; and a system of management ill-suited to its size. The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often primary care is even under the purview of local townships. Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase. According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8 were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes. Brazil The Brazilian health system is composed of a large, public, government managed system, the SUS (Sistema √önico de Sa√∫de), which serves the majority of the population completely free of charge or any form of fee, and a private sector, managed by health insurance funds and private entrepreneurs. The public health system, SUS, was established in 1988 by the Brazilian Constitution, and sits on 3 basic principles of universality, comprehensiveness and equity. Universality states that all citizens must have access to health care services, without any form of discrimination, regarding skin color, income, social status, gender or any other variable. There is no form of charging or payment in any public hospitals or clinics, either for Brazilian nationals or foreigners. Government standards state that citizen's health is the result of multiple variables, including employment, income, access to land, sanitation services, access and quality of health services, education, psychic, social and family conditions, and are entitled to full and complete health care, comprising prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Equity states that health policies should be oriented towards the reduction of inequalities between population groups and individuals, being the most needed the ones for whom policies should be first directed. SUS also has guidelines for its implementation, the most peculiar being popular participation, which defines that all policies are to be planned and supervised directly by the population, through local, city, state and national health councils and conferences. The level of public spending is particularly high in relation to GDP for a country of Brazil's income level and in comparison with its emerging-market peers. Government outlays on health care alone account for nearly 9% of GDP, the second largest item of spending following social protection. In health care, a number of conventional output indicators are not out of step with OECD averages. Following the decentralization of service delivery in the early 1990s, increasing emphasis has appropriately been placed on enhancing preventive care. But, in a decentralized setting, cost-effectiveness depends a great deal on the ability of service deliverers to exploit economies of scale and scope. Experience with inter-municipal initiatives for procurement, as well as flexible arrangements for hospital administration and human-resource management, is by and large positive. Private Health Insurance is widely available in Brazil and may be purchased on an individual-basis or obtained as a work benefit (major employers usually offer private health insurance benefits). Public health care is still accessible for those who choose to obtain private health insurance. As of March 2007, more than 37 million Brazilians had some sort of private health insurance. Canada Canada has a federally sponsored, publicly funded Medicare system. Most services are provided by the public sector, and the remainder are provided by the private sector. ;Political responsibility The Medicare system spans the federal and provincial governments and funding flows from the federal governments to the provinces to administer. The country's prime minister and most provincial premiers say they are committed to the Social Union Framework Agreement that promotes \\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility\\" in health care.Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, \\"A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999.\\" Retrieved 20 December 2006. ;GDP In 2005, Canada spent 9.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,463 per capita. Of that, approximately 70% was government expenditure. ;Services and costs Canada's system is a single-payer system, where basic services are provided by private doctors. Hospitals provide additional services as well as community health clinics, and private clinics. Costs are paid for by the government for many services, but other services can be covered by private health plans that many employers offer as benefits. Some provinces still charge premiums to individuals and families. As well, some hospitals charge minimal user fees for emergency department visits. ;Private sector involvement Other areas of health care, such as dentistry and optometry, are wholly private, although in some provinces, emergency visits to optometrists are partly covered by medicare. Some provinces also allow private services which replicate those that are publicly offered, such as diagnostic services such as ultrasounds, x-Rays, and MRI. As well, many private companies acting as benefits or medical insurance providers have flourished. ;Doctor billings Billing by doctors is complex and varies from province to province. In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. Each province may opt out, though none currently choose to. Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province's medical associations, usually on an annual basis. A physician cannot charge a fee for a service that is higher than the negotiated rate ‚Äì even to patients who are not covered by the publicly funded system ‚Äì unless he or she opts out of billing the publicly funded system altogether. ;Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by government price controls. ;Improvement of the Canadian healthcare system In May 2011, the Health Council released a report entitled: \\"Progress Report 2011: Health Care Renewal in Canada\\", which provides a pan- Canadian look at five key commitments of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal and the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care. This report highlights the progress being achieved to date on wait times, pharmaceuticals management, electronic health records, teletriage, and health innovation. Chile Chile has maintained a dual health care system in which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a universal income tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives. Colombia Costa Rica Costa Rica provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents. Cuba Health care in Cuba consists of a government-coordinated system that guarantees universal coverage and consumes a lower proportion of the nation's GDP (7.3%) than some highly privatised systems (e.g. USA: 16%) (OECD 2008). The system does charge fees in treating elective treatment for patients from abroad, but tourists who fall ill are treated free in Cuban hospitals. Cuba attracts patients mostly from Latin America and Europe by offering care of comparable quality to a developed nation but at much lower prices. Cuba's own health indicators are the best in Latin America and surpass those of the US in some respects (infant mortality rates, underweight babies, HIV infection, immunisation rates, doctor per population rates). (UNDP 2006: Tables 6,7,9,10) In 2005, Cuba spent 7.6% of GDP on health care, or US$310 per capita. Of that, approximately 91% was government expenditure.  El Salvador  Healthcare in El Salvador is free at the point of delivery. The public health system, which is regulated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has 30 public hospitals in the country plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. According to the law of El Salvador, all individuals are given basic health services in public health institutions. Mexico IMSS in downtown Mexico City. IMSS La Raza Medical Center, a typical public hospital in Mexico Health care in Mexico is provided via public institutions or private entities. Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the free-market system (e.g. it is available to those who can afford it). Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government and the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). Advances in medicine and increasing health knowledge have increased the life expectancy in Mexico by an average of 25 years in the last years of the 20th century. Of the 6.6% GDP of government revenue spent on health, this provides only health insurance to 40% of the population who are privately employed. The health care system has three components: the social security institute, governmental services for the un-insured (Seguro Popular), and the private sector that is financed almost completely from out of pocket money. The IMSS, the largest social institution in Latin America, is the governmental institution responsible of executing the Federal Government's health policy. The number of public hospitals in Mexico has increased 41% in ten years from 1985 to 1995. According to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital. In fact, some California insurers sell health insurance policies that require members to go to Mexico for health care where costs are 40% lower.Insurers require insured to go to Mexico Retrieved 10 July 2009. Some of Mexico's top-rate hospitals are internationally accredited. Some Hospitals are Internationally Accredited Retrieved 10 July 2009. Americans, particularly those living near the Mexican border, now routinely cross the border into Mexico for medical care. Philip J. Hilts, Quality and Low Cost of Medical Care Lure Americans to Mexican Doctors, New York Times, 23 November 1992, accessed 10 July 2009 Popular specialties include dentistry and plastic surgery. Mexican dentists often charge 20 to 25 percent of US prices,Manuel Roig-Franzia, Discount Dentistry, South of The Border, Washingtonpost.com, 18 June 2007, accessed 15 October 2008 while other procedures typically cost a third what they would cost in the US. Paraguay In terms of major indicators, health in Paraguay ranks near the median among South American countries. In 2003 Paraguay had a child mortality rate of 1.5 deaths per 1,000 children, ranking it behind Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay but ahead of Brazil and Bolivia. The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as Chagas' disease, run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, malnutrition, lack of proper health care, and poor sanitation are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.Paraguay country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (October 2005). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Health care funding from the national government increased gradually throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13‚Äì20 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors. According to recent estimates, Paraguay has about 117 physicians and 20 nurses per 100,000 population. Peru Peruvian citizens can opt between a state-owned healthcare system and various private insurance companies. The country has a life expectancy higher than the global average but it also has a high risk of infection, especially near the jungle and other isolated areas, due to the warm climate that favours the reproduction of various insects and bacteria. The mortality rate of the population has been decreasing steadily since 1990 and now stands at 19 deaths per 1000 live births. Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago operates under a two-tier health care system. That is, there is the existence of both private health care facilities and public health care facilities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for leading the health sector. The service provision aspect of public health care has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access government-paid health care at public health care facilities where health insurance is not required. The health care system in the country is universal as almost all citizens utilise the services provided. Some, though, opt for private health care facilities for their ailments. Recently, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has launched CDAP (Chronic Disease Assistance Programme). The Chronic Disease Assistance Programme provides citizens with government-paid prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical items to combat several health conditions. United States OECD Health Data 2011.OECD Health Data 2009 ‚Äì Frequently Requested Data. OECD. The United States currently operates under a mixed market health care system. Government sources (federal, state, and local) account for 45% of U.S. health care expenditures.CMS Annual Statistics, United States Department of Health and Human Services Private sources account for the remainder of costs, with 38% of people receiving health coverage through their employers and 17% arising from other private payment such as private insurance and out-of-pocket co-pays. Health care reform in the United States usually focuses around three suggested systems, with proposals currently underway to integrate these systems in various ways to provide a number of health care options. First is single-payer, a term meant to describe a single agency managing a single system, as found in many other developed countries as well as some states and municipalities within the United States. Second are employer or individual insurance mandates. Finally, there is consumer-driven health, in which systems, consumers, and patients have more control of how they access care. Over the past thirty years, most of the nation's health care has moved from the second model operating with not-for-profit institutions to the third model operating with for-profit institutions. In the US, the social and political issues surrounding access to health care have led to vigorous public debate and the almost colloquial use of terms such as health care (medical management of illness), health insurance (reimbursement of health care costs), and public health (the collective state and range of health in a population). In the US, 12% to 16% of the citizens do not have health insurance. State boards and the Department of Health regulate inpatient care to reduce the national health care deficit. To tackle the problems of the increasing number of uninsured, and costs associated with the US health care system, President Barack Obama says he favors the creation of a universal health care system. However, this view is not shared across the country (see, for example, quotes from New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman and Factcheck.org). A few states have taken serious steps toward universal health care coverage, most notably Minnesota, Massachusetts and Connecticut, with recent examples being the Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute and Connecticut's SustiNet plan to provide quality, affordable health care to state residents. The state of Oregon and the city of San Francisco are both examples of governments that adopted universal healthcare systems for strictly fiscal reasons. The United States is alone among developed nations in not having a universal health care system; the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides a nationwide health insurance exchange that came to fruition in 2014, but this is not universal in the way similar countries mean it.The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States . Healthcare in the U.S. does, however, have significant publicly funded components. Medicare covers the elderly and disabled with a historical work record, Medicaid is available for some, but not all, of the poor,Overview ‚Äì What is Not Covered, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the State Children's Health Insurance Program covers children of low-income families. The Veterans Health Administration directly provides health care to U.S. military veterans through a nationwide network of government hospitals; while active duty service members, retired service members and their dependents are eligible for benefits through TRICARE. Together, these tax-financed programs cover 27.8% of the population and make the government the largest health insurer in the nation. The U.S. also spends 17.9% of GDP per year on healthcare, more than double the nearest developed nations expenditure. Venezuela The right to health care is guaranteed in the Venezuelan Constitution. Government campaigns for the prevention, elimination, and control of major health hazards have been generally successful. Immunization campaigns have systematically improved children's health, and regular campaigns to destroy disease-bearing insects and to improve water and sanitary facilities have all boosted Venezuela's health indicators to some of the highest levels in Latin America. The availability of low- or no-cost health care provided by the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security has also made Venezuela's health care infrastructure one of the more advanced in the region. However, despite being the most comprehensive and well funded in the region, the health care system has deteriorated sharply since the 1980s. Government expenditures on health care constituted an estimated 4.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2002. Total health expenditures per capita in 2001 totaled US$386. Per capita government expenditures on health in 2001 totaled US$240. In April 2017 Venezuela's health ministry reported that maternal mortality jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%. It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%. The ministry had not reported health data in two years. Venezuela is suffering from acute shortages of food and medicines. Asia Afghanistan Beginning in 1979, military conflict destroyed the health system of Afghanistan. Most medical professionals left the country in the 1980s and 1990s, and all medical training programmes ceased.Afghanistan country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (May 2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 2004 Afghanistan had one medical facility for every 27,000 people, and some centers were responsible for as many as 300,000 people. In 2004 international organizations provided a large share of medical care. An estimated one-quarter of the population had no access to health care. In 2003 there were 11 physicians and 18 nurses per 100,000 population, and the per capita health expenditure was US$28. Bhutan Bhutan's health care system development accelerated in the early 1960s with the establishment of the Department of Public Health and the opening of new hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. By the early 1990s, health care was provided through twenty-nine general hospitals (including five leprosy hospitals, three army hospitals, and one mobile hospital), forty-six dispensaries, sixty-seven basic health units, four indigenous-medicine dispensaries, and fifteen malaria eradication centers. The major hospitals were the National Referral Hospital in Thimphu, and other hospitals in Geylegphug, and Tashigang. Hospital beds in 1988 totaled 932. There was a severe shortage of health care personnel with official statistics reporting only 142 physicians and 678 paramedics, about one health care professional for every 2,000 people, or only one physician for almost 10,000 people. Training for health care assistants, nurses' aides, midwives, and primary health care workers was provided at the Royal Institute of Health Sciences, associated with Thimphu General Hospital, which was established in 1974. Graduates of the school were the core of the national public health system and helped staff the primary care basic health units throughout the country. Additional health care workers were recruited from among volunteers in villages to supplement primary health care.Worden, Robert L. \\"Health\\".

Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html The end of the famed \\"barefoot doctor\\" system was abolished in 1981. China is undertaking a reform on its health care system. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the health care system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70‚Äì80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.\\"The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties.\\" Authors: Carrin G.1; Ron A.; Hui Y.; Hong W.; Tuohong Z.; Licheng Z.; Shuo Z.; Yide Y.; Jiaying C.; Qicheng J.; Zhaoyang Z.; Jun Y.; Xuesheng L. Source: Social Science and Medicine, Volume 48, Number 7, April 1999, pp.961‚Äì972(12) Health care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the \\"rural collective health system\\" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year medical schools. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage. India In India, the hospitals and clinics are run by government, charitable trusts and by private organizations. The public clinics in rural areas are called Primary Health Centres (PHCs). Public healthcare is free for all and entirely funded through taxes.https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy- center/countries/india Major hospitals are located in district headquarters or major cities. Apart from the modern system of medicine, traditional and indigenous medicinal systems like Ayurvedic and Unani systems are in practice throughout the country. The modern system of medicine is regulated by the Medical Council of India, whereas the alternative systems recognised by Government of India are regulated by the Department of AYUSH (an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha & Homeopathy) under the Ministry of Health, Government of India. PHCs are non-existent in most places, due to poor pay and scarcity of resources. Patients generally prefer private health clinics. These days some of the major corporate hospitals are attracting patients from neighboring countries such as Pakistan, countries in the Middle East and some European countries by providing quality treatment at low cost. In 2005, India spent 5% of GDP on health care, or US$36 per capita. Of that, approximately 19% was government expenditure. Indonesia Indonesia's community health system were organized in three tier, on top of the chart is Community Health Center (Puskesmas), followed by Health Sub-Center on the second level and Village-Level Integrated Post at the third level. According to data from the Ministry of Health of Indonesia there are 2454 hospitals around the country, with total of 305,242 bed counting 0.9 bed per 100,000 inhabitant. Among these 882 of these hospitals are government owned and 1509 are private hospitals. According to the Worldbank data in 2012, there are 0.2 physicians per 1,000 people, with 1.2 Nurses and Midwives per 1,000 people in Indonesia. Out of all the 2454 hospitals in Indonesia, 20 have been accredited by Joint Commission international (JCI) as of 2015. In addition there are 9718 government financed Puskesmas (Health Community Center) listed by the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, which provide comprehensive healthcare and vaccination for the population in the sub-district level. Both traditional and modern health practices are employed. A data taken from World Health Organization (WHO) of 2013 shows that government health expenditures are about 3.1 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP). Israel In Israel, the publicly funded medical system is universal and compulsory. In 2005, Israel spent 7.8% of GDP on health care, or US$1,533 per capita. Of that, approximately 66% was government expenditure. Japan In Japan, services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge higher for those without a referral. Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and pays 70% or more cost for each care and each prescribed drug. Patients are responsible for the remainder (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is 0‚Äì50,000 JPY per household (scaled to annual income). Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure. In 2005, Japan spent 8.2% of GDP on health care, or US$2,908 per capita. Of that, approximately 83% was government expenditure. Jordan In comparison to most of its neighbors, Jordan has quite an advanced health care system, although services remain highly concentrated in Amman. Government figures have put total health spending in 2002 at some 7.5 percent of Gross domestic product (GDP), while international health organizations place the figure even higher, at approximately 9.3 percent of GDP. The country's health care system is divided between public and private institutions. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health operates 1,245 primary health care centers and 27 hospitals, accounting for 37 percent of all hospital beds in the country; the military's Royal Medical Services runs 11 hospitals, providing 24 percent of all beds; and the Jordan University Hospital accounts for 3 percent of total beds in the country. The private sector provides 36 percent of all hospital beds, distributed among 56 hospitals. On 1 June 2007, Jordan Hospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty hospital who gets the international accreditation (JCI). Treatment cost in Jordan hospitals is less than in other countries. Jordan country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (September 2006).

However, bribes often are necessary to obtain needed care. The quality of health care, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, has declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of doctors per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15 percent, to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46 percent, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5 percent of gross domestic product went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4 percent in 2010. A compulsory health insurance system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system. The health system is in crisis in rural areas such as the Aral Sea region, where health is most affected by pollution.Kazakhstancountry profile.

Malaysia Health care in Malaysia is divided into private and public sectors. Doctors are required to undergo a 2-year internship and perform 3 years of service with public hospitals throughout the nation, ensuring adequate coverage of medical needs for the general population. Foreign doctors are encouraged to apply for employment in Malaysia, especially if they are qualified to a higher level. Malaysian society places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public health care ‚Äì an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of telehealth. Over the last couple of years they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment. There is still a shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment made ready by investments. The majority of private hospital facilities are in urban areas and, unlike many of the public hospitals, are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities. North Korea North Korea has a national medical service and health insurance system. As of 2000, some 99 percent of the population had access to sanitation, and 100 percent had access to water, but water was not always potable. Medical treatment is paid for by the state. In the past, there reportedly has been one doctor for every 700 inhabitants and one hospital bed for every 350 inhabitants. Health expenditures in 2001 were 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, and 73 percent of health expenditures were made in the public sector. There were no reported human immuno-deficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) cases as of 2007. However, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 3 million people died from famine in the 1990s, and a 1998 United Nations (UN) World Food Program report revealed that 60 percent of children suffered from malnutrition, and 16 percent were acutely malnourished. UN statistics for the period 1999‚Äì2001 reveal that North Korea's daily per capita food supply was one of the lowest in Asia, exceeding only that of Cambodia, Laos, and Tajikistan, and one of the lowest worldwide. Because of continuing economic problems, food shortages and chronic malnutrition prevail in the 2000s.North Korea country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (July 2007).

Universal healthcare (including prescriptions and dental care) is provided automatically to all citizens and also to expatriates working in the public sector by the Ministry of Health. Non-eligible individuals such as expatriates working in the private sector and foreign visitors can be treated in the government hospitals and clinics for a reasonable fee or they can opt for the more expensive private clinics and medical centres. The Ministry of Health also finances the treatment of citizens abroad if the required treatment is not available in Oman. The life expectancy in Oman as of 2007 was 71.6. It had 1.81 doctors per 1000 pop., 1.9 beds per 1000 pop. and an infant mortality rate of 9 per 1000 live births. Health expenditure accounts for 4.5% of government revenue. Pakistan Pakistan's health indicators, health funding, and health and sanitation infrastructure are generally poor, particularly in rural areas. About 19 percent of the population is malnourished ‚Äì a higher rate than the 17 percent average for developing countries ‚Äì and 30 percent of children under age five are malnourished. Leading causes of sickness and death include gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, congenital abnormalities, tuberculosis, malaria, and typhoid fever. The United Nations estimates that in 2003 Pakistan's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence rate was 0.1 percent among those 15‚Äì49, with an estimated 4,900 deaths from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a major health concern, and both the government and religious community are engaging in efforts to reduce its spread. In 2003 there were 68 physicians for every 100,000 persons in Pakistan. According to 2002 government statistics, there were 12,501 health institutions nationwide, including 4,590 dispensaries, 906 hospitals with a total of 80,665 hospital beds, and 550 rural health centers with a total of 8,840 beds. According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan's total health expenditures amounted to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001, and per capita health expenditures were US$16. The government provided 24.4 percent of total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses. Philippines In 2000 the Philippines had about 95,000 physicians, or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals, of which about 40 percent were government-run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were diarrhea, bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, hypertension, tuberculosis, heart disease, malaria, chickenpox, and measles. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other estimates state that there may have been as many as 9,400 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2001.Philippines country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (March 2006).

Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a universal health care system, and co-exists with private health care system. Infant mortality rate: in 2006 the crude birth rate stood at 10.1 per 1000, and the crude death rate was also one of the lowest in the world at 4.3 per 1000. In 2006, the total fertility rate was only 1.26 children per woman, the 3rd lowest in the world and well below the 2.10 needed to replace the population. Singapore was ranked 6th in the World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000. Singapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources. Singapore currently has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organization.World Health Organization, \\"World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality\\", based on 2005 data. Singapore has \\"one of the most successful health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes,\\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt. Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\"actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country\\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \\"very difficult system to replicate in many other countries.\\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.John Tucci, \\"The Singapore health system ‚Äì achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure\\" , Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004. Singapore's well-established health care system comprises a total of 13 private hospitals, 10 public (government) hospitals and several specialist clinics, each specializing in and catering to different patient needs, at varying costs. Patients are free to choose the providers within the government or private health care delivery system and can walk in for a consultation at any private clinic or any government polyclinic. For emergency services, patients can go at any time to the 24-hour Accident & Emergency Departments located in the government hospitals. Singapore's medical facilities are among the finest in the world, with well qualified doctors and dentists, many trained overseas. Singapore has medical savings account system known as Medisave. Syria The Syrian Ba'ath Party has placed an emphasis on health care, but funding levels have not been able to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001. Syria's health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general hospitals (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; hospital beds totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 physicians, 3,362 dentists, and 14,816 nurses and midwives; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria's health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as Damascus, Aleppo, Tartus, and Latakia.Syria country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (April 2005).

Taiwan, Republic of China The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.Fanchiang, Cecilia.\\"New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits\\", Taiwan Journal, 2 January 2004 Accessed 28 March 2008 NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of- pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for- service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. According to T.R. Reid, Taiwan achieves \\"remarkable efficiency\\", costing ‚âà6 percent of GDP universal coverage; however, this underestimates the cost as it is not fully funded and the government is forced to borrow to make up the difference. \\"And frankly, the solution is fairly obvious: increase the spending a little, to maybe 8 percent of GDP. Of course, if Taiwan did that, it would still be spending less than half of what America spends.\\"T.R. Reid \\"Taiwan Takes Fast Track to Universal Health Care\\", NPR 15 April 2008. Thailand The majority of health care services in Thailand is delivered by the public sector, which includes 1,002 hospitals and 9,765 health stations. Universal health care is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the Universal Coverage scheme theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in these programs, though most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the Universal Coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion Foundation (\\"ThaiHealth\\"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care. Turkmenistan In the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 Turkmenistan had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President Niyazov‚Äôs 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside Ashgabat intensified this trend. Physicians are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply. In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Government-paid public health care was abolished in 2004.Turkmenistan country profile.

United Arab Emirates Standards of health care are considered to be generally high in the United Arab Emirates, resulting from increased government spending during strong economic years. According to the UAE government, total expenditures on health care from 1996 to 2003 were US$436 million. According to the World Health Organization, in 2004 total expenditures on health care constituted 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the per capita expenditure for health care was US$497. Health care currently is government-paid only for UAE citizens. Effective January 2006, all residents of Abu Dhabi are covered by a new comprehensive health insurance program; costs will be shared between employers and employees. The number of doctors per 100,000 (annual average, 1990‚Äì99) is 181. The UAE now has 40 public hospitals, compared with only seven in 1970. The Ministry of Health is undertaking a multimillion-dollar program to expand health facilities ‚Äì hospitals, medical centers, and a trauma center ‚Äì in the seven emirates. A state-of-the-art general hospital has opened in Abu Dhabi with a projected bed capacity of 143, a trauma unit, and the first home health care program in the UAE. To attract wealthy UAE nationals and expatriates who traditionally have traveled abroad for serious medical care, Dubai is developing Dubai Healthcare City, a hospital free zone that will offer international-standard advanced private health care and provide an academic medical training center; completion is scheduled for 2010.United Arab Emirates country profile.

Uzbekistan In the post-Soviet era, the quality of Uzbekistan‚Äôs health care has declined. Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian emigration in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to free health care, in the post-Soviet era bribery has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.Uzbekistan country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (February 2007).

Vietnam The overall quality of health in Vietnam is regarded as good, as reflected by 2005 estimates of life expectancy (70.61 years) and infant mortality (25.95 per 1,000 live births). However, malnutrition is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and infant mortality rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals‚Äô own pockets.Vietnam country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 2005). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1954 the government in the North established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level. After reunification in 1976, this system was extended to the South. Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to water supply and sewage systems. As a result, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as malaria, dengue fever, typhoid, and cholera. Inadequate funding also has contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives, and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the World Bank. Yemen Despite the significant progress Yemen has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped. Total expenditures on health care in 2002 constituted 3.7 percent of gross domestic product. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low, as compared with other Middle Eastern countries ‚Äì US$58 according to United Nations statistics and US$23 according to the World Health Organization. According to the World Bank, the number of doctors in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons. In 2003 Yemen had only 0.6 hospital beds available per 1,000 persons.Yemen country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 2006).

Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas; only 25 percent of rural areas are covered by health services, as compared with 80 percent of urban areas. Emergency services, such as ambulance service and blood banks, are non-existent. Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which vaccines exist or that are otherwise preventable. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in 2003 an estimated 12,000 people in Yemen were living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Europe Belgium As in most countries, the Belgian system divides itself into state and private, though fees are payable in both. A person must have adequate coverage through either the state or private insurance. In the state mutuelle/mutualiteit scheme a person has the ability to choose any doctor, clinic or hospital in any location without referral, according to the patient's needs in much the same way as with private insurance. Doctors General practitioners can be found in private practices or attached to clinics and hospitals. A person is free to consult or register with any of their own choosing. Similarly with specialist consultants. Reimbursements are available for those with insurance, either private or public. If a patient is on a private scheme, or is uninsured, the fee is payable in full at the time of the appointment. The patient then brings, mails or deposits the receipt to his insurance mutuality which then immediately repays the amount. The majority of dentists in Belgium are private, though there are those who accept part-payment on state insurance. As with general practitioners, patients can arrange to see a specialist of their choice at any hospital. Those going into hospital for a planned stay need to take personal care items (such as a towel, soap etc.) with them. In Brussels, the eleven big public hospitals are organized under the Iris association. Complementary health care The Ministry of Health recognizes homeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic as reimbursable alternative treatments. Reimbursement is possible only if the practitioner is registered as a qualified doctor. Emergency treatment If a call is made to the Emergency services using the old emergency number (100) or the European telephone number (112), an ambulance will transport the patient to the nearest hospital or the best centre suited according to the needs of the patient, for example, a Specialist Burns Unit. Pharmacies Pharmacies are common in Belgium and are marked with a green cross on the street. There is a rota system for pharmacists to open outside of usual hours through the night. Health Insurance Health care insurance is a part of the Belgian social security system. To enroll, a person must first join a health insurance fund mutuelle (mutualit√©) or ziekenfonds (mutualiteit) for which an employer's certificate is required if the employer is to contribute to the cost. If employed a person's contributions is automatically deducted from salary. The employer will also pay a contribution. Health insurance funds will reimburse medical costs. The choice of mutual insurer is up to the individual. Most of them are affiliated to a religious or political institution but there is no real difference between them because reimbursement rates are fixed by the Belgian government. Insurance funds do not always cover the full costs of treatment and typical reimbursement is between half to three-quarters of a typical doctors or specialists visit. A deciding factor here depends on one's job. From people who are unemployed or disabled, receiving other benefits or business-owners receive somewhat less. There is also a \\"yearly maximum bill\\" meaning that someone who has paid a certain amount to their doctor/hospital within the year does not have to make any further payment. From this point, any extra is returned from the patient's insurance. In general, the poor, even without reaching the necessary sum, do not pay anything. Insured persons have a standardized credit card style SIS-card:nl:SIS-kaart, Retrieved 2010-05-01 which is needed in pharmacies and hospitals. Bulgaria Bulgaria began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the communist era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on communist-era public clinics while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary health care costs. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of salaries, with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private physicians. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.Bulgaria country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (October 2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the European Union (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures. In the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and paramedical training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system's long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of doctors but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population. Denmark Denmark's health care system has retained the same basic structure since the early 1970s. The administration of hospitals and personnel is dealt with by the Ministry of the Interior, while primary care facilities, health insurance, and community care are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Anyone can go to a physician for no fee and the public health system entitles each Dane to his/her own doctor. Expert medical/surgical aid is available, with a qualified nursing staff. Costs are borne by public authorities, but high taxes contribute to these costs. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.4 physicians and 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The number of hospital beds, like that in other EU countries, has undergone a major decline since 1980, from around 40,000 to about 23,000 in 1998/99. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients has contributed significantly to this trend. The ratio of doctors to population, by contrast, has increased during this period. The total fertility rate in 2000 was 1.7, while the maternal mortality rate was 10 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. Studies show that between 1980 and 1993, 63% of married women (ages 15 to 49) used contraception. As of 2002 cardiovascular diseases and cancer were the leading causes of death. Denmark's cancer rates were the highest in the European Union. In 1999, there were only 12 reported cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. As of 1999, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4,300 and deaths from AIDS that year were estimated at less than 100. HIV prevalence was 0.17 per 100 adults. Danish citizens may choose between two systems of primary health care: medical care paid for by the government provided by a doctor whom the individual chooses for a year and by those specialists to whom the doctor refers the patient; or complete freedom of choice of any physician or specialist at any time, with state reimbursement of about two-thirds of the cost for medical bills paid directly by the patient. Most Danes opt for the former. All patients receive subsidies on pharmaceuticals and vital drugs; everyone must pay a share of dental bills. As of 1999, total health care expenditure was estimated at 8.4% of GDP. Responsibility for the public hospital service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, each of which is allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed medical health officers, responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999. Estonia Healthcare in Estonia is supervised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service. Finland In Finland, public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 78% by taxation, 20% by patients through access charges, and by others 2%. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits are (‚Ç¨11 per visit with annual ‚Ç¨33 cap), hospital outpatient treatment (‚Ç¨22 per visit), a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines (‚Ç¨26 per 24 hours, or ‚Ç¨12 if in a psychiatric hospital). After a patient has spent ‚Ç¨590 per year on public medical services, all treatment and medications thereafter are paid for by the government. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. Patients can claim re- imbursement of part of their prescription costs from KELA. Finland also has a much smaller private medical sector which accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Private sector patients can claim a contribution from KELA towards their private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to be treated in the more expensive private sector, or they can join private insurance funds. However, private sector health care is mainly in the primary care sector. There are virtually no private hospitals, the main hospitals being either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). In 2005, Finland spent 7.5% of GDP on health care, or US$2,824 per capita. Of that, approximately 78% was government expenditure. France In its 2000 assessment of world health systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \\"best overall health care\\" in the world. In 2005, France spent 11.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,926 per capita. Of that, approximately 80% was government expenditure. In France, most doctors remain in private practice; there are both private and public hospitals. Social Security consists of several public organizations, distinct from the state government, with separate budgets that refunds patients for care in both private and public facilities. It generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them nonprofit, mutual insurers, to the point that the word \\"\\" (mutual) has come to be a synonym of supplemental private insurer in common language. Until recently, social security coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers, unemployed or retirees), excluding some few poor segments of the population; the government of Lionel Jospin put into place the \\"universal health coverage\\" allowing the entire French population to benefit from Health care. In some systems, patients can also take private health insurance but choose to receive care at public hospitals, if allowed by the private insurer. For serious illness, regardless of the insurance regime, the national health system will assume the cost of long-term remedial treatment. Germany The University Medical Center Freiburg in Germany Germany has a universal multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: Public \\"law-enforced\\" health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung), and private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung). Those who make below a certain income must use the public health insurance. Those are compulsorily insured (Pflichtversichert). Private health insurance is only available to freelancers and high earners. Those are voluntarily insured (freiwillig versichert). Employers pay for half of their employees' health insurance contributions, while the self-employed must pay the full contribution themselves. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) at the level of federal states (L√§nder). Public health insurers are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage. They can only refuse coverage to the privately insured who are self-employed, or high earners. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may decide to remain in the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or opt out & take private insurance. Private supplementary insurance to the sickness funds of various sorts is available. In 2005, Germany spent 10.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,628 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure. Greece The Greek healthcare system is universal and is ranked as one of the best in the world. In a 2000 World Health Organization report it was ranked 14th in the overall assessment and 11th at quality of service, surpassing countries such as the United Kingdom (18th) and Germany (25th). In 2010 there were 131 hospitals with 35,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011 the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity announced its proposal to shorten the number to 83 hospitals with 33,000 beds. Greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 OECD report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%. The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country. Life expectancy in Greece is 80.3 years, above the OECD average of 79.5. and among the highest in the world. The same OECD report showed that Greece had the largest percentage of adult daily smokers of any of the 34 OECD members. The country's obesity rate is 18.1%, which is above the OECD average of 15.1% but considerably below the American rate of 27.7%. In 2008 Greece had the highest rate of perceived good health in the OECD, at 98.5%. Infant mortality is one of the lowest in the developed world with a rate of 3.1 deaths/1000 live births. Iceland Healthcare in Iceland is universal. The healthcare system is largely paid for by taxes (85%) and to some extent by service fees (15%) and is administrated by the Ministry of Welfare. A considerable portion of government spending is assigned to healthcare. There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals. Ireland All persons resident in the Republic of Ireland are entitled to health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are however paid for by the government, as well as health care of infants under 6 months of age. Emergency care is provided at a cost of ‚Ç¨120 for a visit to a hospital Emergency Department. Italy According to WHO in 2000, Italy had the world's \\"second overall best\\" healthcare system in the world, coming after France, and surpassing Spain, Oman and Japan. In 1978 Italy adopted a tax-funded universal health care system called \\"National Health Service\\" (in Italian: Servizio Sanitario Nazionale), which was closely modeled on the British system. The SSN covers general practice (distinct between adult and pediatric practice), outpatient and inpatient treatments, and the cost of most (but not all) drugs and sanitary ware. The government sets LEA (fundamental levels of care, Livelli essenziali di assistenza in Italian) which cover all necessary treatments, which the state must guarantee to all, paid for by the government, or for a \\"ticket\\", a share of the costs (but various categories are exempted). LEA. The public system has also the duty of prevention at place of work and in the general environment. A private sector also exists, with a minority role in medicine but a principal role in dental health, as most people prefer private dental services. In Italy the public system has the unique feature of paying general practitioners a fee per capita per year, a salary system, that does not reward repeat visits, testing, and referrals. While there is a paucity of nurses, Italy has one of the highest doctor per capita ratios at 3.9 doctors per 1,000 patients. In 2005, Italy spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,714 per capita. Of that, approximately 76% was government expenditure. Netherlands Health care in the Netherlands, has since January 2006 been provided by a system of compulsory insurance backed by a risk equalization program so that the insured are not penalized for their age or health status. This is meant to encourage competition between health care providers and insurers. Children under 18 are insured by the government, and special assistance is available to those with limited incomes. In 2005, the Netherlands spent 9.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,560 per capita. Of that, approximately 65% was government expenditure. Norway Norway has a government run and government financed universal health care system, covering physical and mental health for all and dental health for children under the age of 16. Hospitals are paid by the state and doctor visit fees are capped at a fairly low rate. Short-term prescriptions for medication are market price, but long-term prescriptions, defined as more than three months a year, are eligible for a large discount. In addition, a yearly cap applies for people with high medical expenses. Some health care is private. For example, most adults use private dental care, whereas the public system only treats people, for a normal fee, when they have free capacity. Health-related plastic surgery (like burn damage) is covered by the public system, while cosmetic surgery in general is private. There are a number of private psychologists, there are also some private general practice doctors and specialists. Public health care is financed by a special-purpose income tax on the order of 8‚Äì11%, loosely translated as \\"public benefits fee\\" (Norwegian: \\"trygdeavgift og Folketrygden\\"). This can be considered a mandatory public insurance, covering not only health care but also loss of income during sick leave, public pension, unemployment benefits, benefits for single parents and a few others. The system is supposed to be self-financing from the taxes. Norwegian citizens living in Norway are automatically covered, even if they never had taxable income. Norwegian citizens living and working abroad (taxable elsewhere and therefore not paying the \\"public benefits fee\\" to Norway) are covered for up to one year after they move abroad, and must pay an estimated market cost for public health care services. Non-citizens such as foreign visitors are covered in full. According to WHO, total health care expenditure in 2005 was 9% of GDP and paid 84% by government, 15% by private out-of-pocket and ‚âà1% by other private sources. Poland In Poland, healthcare is delivered through a publicly funded healthcare system, which is free for all citizens, and this is enshrined in Article 68 of the Constitution of Poland. Poland's expenditure on healthcare was 6.7% of GDP in 2012 or $900 per capita. The public spending rate for Poland in 2012 was 72% ‚Äì in-line with the OECD average. A number of private medical complexes also complement public healthcare institutions nationwide. Romania Health care public system has been improved but it is still poor by European standards, and access is limited in rural areas. In 2007 health expenditures were equal to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product. In 2007 there were 2.2 physicians and 6.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The system is funded by the National Health Care Insurance Fund, to which employers and employees make mandatory contributions. Private health care system has developed slowly but now consists of 22 private hospitals and more than 240 clinics.Romania country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (May 2006).

Russia in 1991-1993 has changed to a mixed model of health care. Article 41 of the 1993 constitution confirmed a citizen's right to healthcare and medical assistance free of charge in state and municipal health establishments.Constitution of Russia. Article 41. 1. Everyone shall have the right to health protection and medical aid. Medical aid in state and municipal health establishments shall be rendered to individuals gratis, at the expense of the corresponding budget, insurance contributions, and other proceeds. Private clinics are separate system and it is funded by separate payments of their clients or by private insurance companies via paid voluntary health insurance (known as –î–ú–° - DMS). Only paid clinics allow all types of anonymous medical care. State and municipal health establishments also have the right to provide paid services to any person or in addition to free services. In all life-threatening cases, emergency medical services, including ambulance vehicles, hospitalization, surgery, etc, are completely free of charge and any documents and name/surname are not required. According to the law \\"on the basics of health protection of citizens\\", emergency assistance is provided by a medical organization and a medical employee immediately and free of charge. Refusal to provide it is not allowed. If a medical organization participates in the program of state guarantees of free medical care, it is not allowed to refuse to provide medical care and charge fees. In both of the above cases, a medical employee and a medical organization can be punished under the Criminal Code if the patient has suffered \\"medium harm\\" or higher as a result of the lack of aid. State and municipal health establishments and their workers are funded by multiple sources. The system of compulsory medical insurance (–æ–±—è–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ, –û–ú–° - obyzatel'noye meditsinskoye strakhovaniye, OMS) is funded by general taxes of individuals and companies via federal, regional and municipal budgets and by employer's additional quasi-tax obligatory payments (officially called \\"insurance contributions\\" but collected by Tax Service) via the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund and Territorial Funds of Russian regions. Medical aid in state and municipal health establishments is available for free to all citizens as well as to foreign permanent residents, foreign temporary residents, stateless persons and refugees regardless of their income or employment status, in all cases with mandatory and free-of-charge pre-conclusion of a contract, confirmed by OMS insurance policy (–ø–æ–ª–∏—Å –û–ú–° - polis OMS), with one of the private insurance companies decided to participate in the OMS system. Internal passport of Russia and Individual insurance account number are required for Russian citizens. Identity document and legal status in Russia are required for foreigners and stateless persons. Lack of legal status for foreigners and military service in the Russian Armed Forces for Russian citizens are the only reasons for refusal to obtain or use OMS insurance policy provided that it is not allowed to have two OMS insurance policies. On 1 January 2018, 146.3 million persons were in the OMS system, including 66.4 mln employed and 79.9 mln unemployed persons (the total population of Russia on 1 January 2018 was 146 880 432 persons). OMS insurance policy is a document confirming the right to receive free medical care. OMS insurance policy or its details are required when applying to state and municipal health establishments. If a person has OMS insurance policy, but does not have it with him, it is not possible to refuse him medical care. A person must choose a permanent establishment for medical care. Health establishment can refuse only in case of overcrowding.{{cite web|url=https://www.mos.ru/otvet-zdorovie/kak- prikrepitsya-k-poliklinike-v-moskve/{{ Basic services are available for free throughout the country while regional list of services is available for free only in a region of permanent residence. In some cases, free treatment in private clinics (that decided to participate in the OMS system, in very limited cases since this is one of the recent changes to the system), free dental prosthetics and free medications are available through the OMS system. Introduction in 1993 reform of new free market providers in addition to the state-run institutions intended to promote both efficiency and patient choice. A purchaser-provider split help facilitate the restructuring of care, as resources would migrate to where there was greatest demand, reduce the excess capacity in the hospital sector and stimulate the development of primary care. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a new large-scale health care reform in 2011 and pledged to allocate more than 300 billion rubles ($10 billion) in the next few years to improve health care in the country. He also said that obligatory medical insurance tax paid by companies will increase from current 3.1% to 5.1% starting from 2011. Sweden Karolinska university hospital in Stockholm (2006) The Swedish public health system is funded through taxes levied by the county councils, but partly run by private companies. There is a fixed charge of SEK 150 (US$21) for each visit to a doctor or a hospital but some may vary depending on the business itself and cause of admission & desired service whereas prices can vary up to SEK 350 (US$52). Healthcare services that are accepted by the Swedish Board of Health (h√§lsov√•rdsn√§mnden) have \\"safe net\\" limits for visitors placed upon them to a maximum SEK 800 (US$111) per year along with prescription medicine from those clinics are also limited to 1,800 SEK (US$249) per year. Government-paid dental care for children under 21 years old is included in the system, and dental care for grown-ups is to a small extent subsidised by it. Sweden also has a smaller private health care sector, mainly in larger cities or as centers for preventive health care financed by employers. Switzerland A private hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. In Switzerland, compulsory health insurance covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalization of the insured. The Swiss healthcare system is a combination of public, subsidized private and totally private healthcare providers, where the insured person has full freedom of choice among the providers in his region. Insurance companies independently set their price points for different age groups, but are forbidden from setting prices based on health risk. In 2000, Switzerland topped all European countries‚Äô health care expenditure when calculated as per capita expenditure in US dollar purchasing parity terms. The Swiss health care system was the last for-profit system in Europe. In the 1990s, after the private carriers began to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ‚Äì and when the uninsured population of Switzerland reached 5% ‚Äì the Swiss held a referendum (1995) and adopted their present system. Turkey A hospital in ƒ∞stanbul Health care in Turkey used to be dominated by a centralized state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003 the government introduced a sweeping health reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making health care available to a larger share of the population. Information from the Turkish Statistical Institute states that 76.3 billions of Turkish Liras are being spent in healthcare, with 79.6% of funding coming from the Sosyal G√ºvenlik Kurumu and most of the remainder (15.4%) coming from out-of-pocket payments. There are 27.954 medical institutions, one doctor for 587 people and 2.54 beds for 1000 people. United Kingdom The four countries of the United Kingdom have separate but co-operating public health care systems that were created in 1948: in England the public health system is known as the National Health Service, in Scotland it is known as NHS Scotland, in Wales as NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), and in Northern Ireland it is called Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland. All four provide state-paid healthcare to all UK residents, paid for from general taxation. Though the public systems dominate, private health care and a wide variety of alternative and complementary treatments are available for those who have private health insurance or are willing to pay directly themselves. One difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently abolished, or are in the process of abolishing, all prescription charges, while England (with the exception of birth control pills, which are paid for by the state) continues to charge patients who are between 18 and 60 years old a fixed prescription fee of ¬£9.15 per item or yearly prepayment of ¬£105.90, unless they are exempt because of certain medical conditions (including cancer) or are on low income. Since health care delivery is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.NHS now four different systems, BBC, 2 January 2008 Oceania Australia In Australia the current system, known as Medicare, was instituted in 1984. It coexists with a private health system. All legal permanent residents are entitled to government-paid public hospital care. Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high- income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,181 per capita. Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure. New Zealand In New Zealand hospitals are public and treat citizens or permanent residents, with the fees paid by the government, and are managed by District Health Boards. Under the Labour coalition governments (1999‚Äì2008), there were plans to make primary health care available with charges paid for by the government. At present government subsidies exist in health care. The cost of visiting a GP ranges from government-paid to $45.00 for children and from government-paid to $75.00 for adults under the current subsidies. This system is funded by taxes. The New Zealand government agency Pharmac subsidizes certain pharmaceuticals depending upon their category. Co-payments exist, however these are lower if the user has a Community Services Card or High User Health Card. In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.

Keefe, 402 U.S. 415 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that courts cannot prohibit peaceful distribution of pamphlets, unless a heavy burden is met to justify prior restraint.  Background  Keefe, a real estate broker, worked in the Chicago neighborhood of Austin. Keefe soon garnered a reputation for his business practices, which were considered to be inflammatory and controversial. Among the asserted practices was that Keefe attempted to generate sales by panicking white homeowners into selling at below-market prices by suggesting that African Americans would soon be living nearby, then selling the houses to African Americans at market value or higher (a practice known as blockbusting). Some residents of Austin, including the Organization for a Better Austin (OBA), attempted to coerce Keefe to change his tactics by distributing flyers in the town of Westchester, where Keefe resided. Keefe sued, and obtained an injunction preventing the OBA from distributing flyers in Keefe's neighborhood. The OBA argued that their pamphlets were merely informational, but Keefe argued that they were invasions of privacy, and were intimidating. The Illinois Appellate Court upheld the injunction (115 Ill.App.2d 236, 253 N.E.2d 76).  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court, in an 8 to 1 decision, overturned the injunction. The court ruled that peaceful distribution of pamphlets is an important aspect of the First Amendment freedom of speech, and that prior restraint of such peaceful speech requires a very compelling reason. Justice Harlan dissented solely on the basis that the injunction did not constitute a \\"final decision\\" from which an appeal could be taken, and that the Court thus lacked jurisdiction.

The program, written mainly in fortran-90 with some parts in C or in Fortran-77, was built out of the merging and re-engineering of different independently developed core packages, plus a set of packages, designed to be inter-operable with the core components, which allow the performance of more advanced tasks. The basic packages include Pwscf which solves the self-consistent Kohn and Sham equations, obtained for a periodic solid, CP to carry out Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, and PostProc, which allows data analysis and plotting. Regarding the additional packages, is noteworthy to point out atomic for the pseudopotential generation, PHonon package, which implements density- functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for the calculation of second- and third-order derivatives of the energy with respect to atomic displacements and NEB: for the calculation of reaction pathways and energy barriers.  Target problems  The different tasks that can be performed include * Ground state calculations * Structural optimization * Transition states and minimum energy paths * Response properties (DFPT), such as phonon frequencies, electron- phonon interactions and EPR and NMR chemical shifts * AB initio Molecular Dynamics: Car-Parrinello and Born-Oppenheimer MD * Spectroscopic properties * Quantum import * Generation of pseudopotentials  Parallelization  The main components of the QUANTUM ESPRESSO distribution are designed to exploit the architecture of today's supercomputers characterized by multiple levels and layers of inter-processor communication . The parallelization is achieved using both MPI and OpenMP parallelization, allowing the main codes of the distribution to run in parallel on most or all parallel machines with very good performance.

Anderson, and it was completed in 1920. Utah Governor Simon Bamberger spoke at the dedication on March 28, 1920. When the synagogue was built, its front had circular windows that contained colored glass with a star of David. Rabbi Joseph Strinkomsky served as the congregation's first rabbi. Services were in line with Orthodox Judaism, with different seating areas for men and women. Most of the members lived within a short walk of the synagogue, and they shopped at a kosher butcher nearby. The congregation disbanded in the 1930s, and the building was sold to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1948. and At the time of the building's sale, many of the original members of the congregation had died, and others were attending religious services at B'nai Israel, which followed Reform Judaism, or at Montefiore Synagogue, which followed Conservative Judaism. A new Veterans of Foreign Wars post, led by Guy Snyder and Post Commander Lloyd S. Grover, began using the building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Summary The state of Indiana, for the 1972 election, required nominees to submit a sworn oath stating that their party \\"does not advocate the overthrow of local, state or national government by force or violence.\\" The Communist Party of Indiana refused to submit such a declaration, and as a result Indiana refused to put their candidates on the ballot. The Communist Party appealed to the Supreme Court. In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court held in favor of the Communist Party. The majority opinion, authored by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and joined by four other Justices, stated that \\"a group advocating violent overthrow as abstract doctrine need not be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action.\\" The court also held that \\"the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action.\\" Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a short opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by three other Justices. In his view, there is no need to decide the free speech question. Instead, he concluded that as the Indiana officials did not apply the loyalty oath requirement to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, their discriminatory application of the requirement to the Communist Party violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

History First mentioned in 1466, around 1546 the village of Dyvin received city rights. Around that time the town had 184 houses, a market square and five streets in total. In 1642 king of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa granted the burghers with Magdeburg Law. The charter however was withdrawn by king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski in 1776. In 1795 the town, along with the rest of eastern Poland, was annexed by the Russian Empire in the effect of the Partitions of Poland. Two years later the town, by then demoted to a mere village, was donated to Pyotr Rumyantsev as his personal property and its inhabitants were turned into serfs. In 1878 the town had 2490 inhabitants, including 998 Jews . The town also had four mills, two Orthodox churches, once Catholic church and a synagogue . According to the 1921 Polish census the population of the town was 2299. Soon however the town was downgraded to a village again and attached to a gmina of Dywin. The town became a part of Poland as a result of the 1921 Peace of Riga. It was retaken by the USSR in 1939, and annexed to the Belarusian SSR. The German occupied the town in 1941. Jews of the town are imprisoned in a ghetto before being murdered in a mass execution in 1942 In October 1942 the first detachment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army was created in Dyvin.

Haven Herefords is the oldest family run herd of Hereford cattle in the world and is operated from the hamlet known as The Haven at Dilwyn in Herefordshire, UK. The herd is in its fifth generation and is currently being run by Edward Lewis. Herd history Thomas Lewis - founder of The Haven herd Thomas Lewis Thomas Lewis founded his Hereford herd at The Woodhouse, Shobdon, Herefordshire in 1822, 24 years before the publication of the first Hereford Cattle Herd Book. Many animals were exported from The Woodhouse Herd especially to the United States of America in the boom years of the 1880s, although Hereford cattle had first been introduced to the country in either 1816 or 1817. Amongst the 1880s sales was Woodhouse Dowager 6th whom Messrs. Gudgell & Simpson bought, along with Anxiety 4th, in 1881 and became the cornerstone of the Hereford breed's presence in the US. The policy of Gudgell and Simpson was to line breed their early imports, and their most notable achievement was the breeding of Prince Domino in 1914: he was probably the greatest bull in the early development of the North American Herefords. There were at least eight crosses of Woodhouse Dowager 6th in the pedigree of this bull. James Lewis James Lewis moved from The Woodhouse when he married Margaret Bray, whose grandfather was a nephew of Benjamin Tomkins, the original breeder of the Hereford. The couple set up home at The Haven in 1888 and continued to breed Herefords. One of the cows that they brought from The Woodhouse was Teresa 2nd, who founded the Tiny and Thrush families that are still prominent in the herd today. Among his most successful bulls during this period was Leyburn, a notable breeder of the day who produced a son, Haven Turgot, who was Champion at Hereford Show and Sale in 1917. Turgot was the first bull to be brought out by a Lady in Hereford Market, this being James Lewis' daughter as his son Edward was away at World War I. Edward Lewis Edward Lewis took over The Haven from his father, James, when he married Beatrice Francis in 1928. This being the period of the Great Depression, the first ten years of his breeding was concentrated on survival and maintenance of the best attributes of the Hereford strain. He managed this by acquiring Free Town Bodyguard in 1946, a son of Bodyguard. Haven Victory was sold to Senor Duggan from Argentina in the February Show and Sale and Haven Broadside, another son of Bodyguard, was the first bull to make 1000 guineas at the Hereford April Sale when sold to the Duke of Newcastle. In 1948, Haven Idol, son of Tarington Magnate, was purchased by The Woodlands stud in Australia, where he proved to be an outstanding sire. The Queen viewed the cattle at Hereford Market in this year. E. L. Lewis & Son E. L. Lewis & Son was formed in 1949 when Edward's son, Leslie, and daughter, Sybil, joined their father. Their first purchase was Shucknall Favourite, who proved to be one of the top breed sires for over a decade. Many of his progeny were exported throughout the world and were almost unbeatable in the show ring. The Haven acquired the female lines namely the Pinky, Prunella and Julia families formerly of the Vern herd and the Lady Lynda's of the Tarrington herd. Still in the herd today. The Glasgow Herald reported that representative animals from the herd \\"swept the boards\\" at the Royal Highland Show of 1964 and \\"stole the show\\" at the 1965 event. In 1976 the same newspaper noted that the herd was \\"internationally famous\\", with sales having been made to Canada, China, Egypt, Israel, Russia, South Africa and South America. It was also noted that Edward and Leslie Lewis had produced \\"many champion Herefords\\". At that time it was stated that on-the-farm auctions were planned to be an annual event.
