History In 1907, Richard Oswald mounted a version of The Hound of the Baskervilles in Praterstra√üe based on Der Hund von Baskerville: Schauspiel in vier Aufz√ºgen aus dem Schottischen Hochland. Frei nach Motiven aus Poes und Doyles Novellen (The Hound of the Baskervilles: a play in four acts set in the Scottish Highlands.

Films based on mystery novels were very successful in German cinema at the time so Oswald found himself in the position to pen a film script based on The Hound of the Baskervilles. Production Richard Oswald penned the tale which blended Doyle's original story and Der Hund von Baskerville and Rudolf Meinert was tasked with the direction. Alwin Neu√ü was cast to portray Sherlock Holmes in Der Hund von Baskerville. Neu√ü had previously played the role in 1910's Das Milliontestament.

Municipally, it serves as the administrative center of Budogoshskoye Urban Settlement, one of the two urban settlements in the district. Population: History Budogoshch was founded in 1914 as a settlement serving the railway station. The name was taken over from a nearby village which existed presumably from the 17th century. At the time, Budogoshch was part of Tikhvinsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. June 26, 1918, the uyezd was transferred to newly established Cherepovets Governorate. On August 1, 1927 the governorate was abolished, and the area was transferred to Leningrad Oblast. Simultaneously, Budogoshchensky District with the center in Budogoshch was established as part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. In 1932, Budogoshchensky District was abolished and split between Dregelsky and Kirishsky Districts of Leningrad Oblast. Between October 23 and December 21, 1941, Budogoshch was occupied by German troops. After the liberation, the railroad connecting Budogoshch with Tikhvin, which was restored in 1943, played a key role in providing Leningrad with food and other supplies. Kirishi, which was occupied for two years, was greatly damaged, and on February 1944 the administrative center of Kirishsky District was moved to Budogoshch. On February 1, 1963 the district was abolished and merged into Volkhovsky District, and on January 12, 1965 it was re- established, with Kirishi as the district center. Economy Industry There are several timber industry enterprises located in Budogoshch. Transportation Budogoshch is connected by roads with Kirishi, Chudovo, Nebolchi, and Tikhvin. There is a railway station on the railroad connecting Sonkovo and Mga. From Budogoshch, there are direct suburban trains to Saint Petersburg via Mga. Another railway running to Tikhvin branches off northeast. In the 1930s, the railway to Chudovo was constructed and was in operation for cargo traffic, but it was destroyed during the war and never restored. Culture The military cemetery in Budogoshch from the Second World War is protected as a cultural heritage monument of local importance.

She was also the first American female and a female Westerner to have become a swami monk. Louise was initiated by Vivekananda at Thousand Island Park in 1895. She was given the monastic name Abhayananda. She later disassociated herself from Vivekananda and preached philosophy, retaining the same name. Abhayananda claimed to be the only female swami in the entire world. > There were many other Westeners who, in the first half of the century, > became Hindu disciples/sannyasis/gurus: others included the Mother (b. Mira > Alfassa, Paris, 1878), perhaps the first Westener to become a guru in India; > Swami Abhayananda (b. Marie Lousie) one of the only three Westeners whom > Vivekananda, in 1895, initiated as sannyasis--the other two being Leon > Landsberg/Swami Kripananda and Dr Street/Swami Yogananda. Personal details Abhayananda immigrated to the US in 1865. Before becoming a swami and entering monastic life, she lectured on a number of issues such as woman's rights, and was a suffragist. There appears to be only one sketch depicting her and only one photograph, appearing in an article as a \\"convert to Hinduism\\" in the Lethbridge Herald on August 10, 1912. There is a letter written by her addressed to one of his disciples, Sister Christine, referring her last arrival in India as an allusion of her desire for money. Her exact death details are unknown. An article in The New York Times parsed \\"Swami Abhayananda\\": \\"Swami means monk, Abahaya means fearless, and nanda means bliss. The literal interpretation of her name is, therefore, the 'Monk of Fearless Bliss'.\\" Marie Louise disassociated herself from Vivekananda after she arrived India. Sister Nivedita's letters portrayed Louise as an egotistic, self-centered woman that had little interest in hearing the Vivekananda's teachings. Louise was also alleged to have come from a destitute past and to have been in need of financial assistance. Her mission According to Louise: > I teach four classes of philosophy-the Karma Loga(reporter might have > misspelt for Karma Yoga), which is the philosophy of actions; the Bhakti > Loga(reporter might have misspelt for Bhakti Yoga, the philosophy of > devotion and love; the Rajah Loga (reporter might have misspelt for Raja > Yoga), a physiological and psychological man, and the Gnana Loga (reporter > might have misspelt for Jnana Yoga, or philosophy. ... I teach Christ the > man. All men are Christs, and are crucified on the cross of life. Regarding women's suffrage, Louise said: > \\"The woman Suffragists, are children playing with dolls, but if men vote, > then women have a right to vote on the theory of right; but on the plane of > love they have no right to vote. A 'right' implies brute force and power. A > King has a 'right' to behead half of his subjects if he chooses, if the > subjects preserve their 'right' to live. It is the 'right' of brutes.

Development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. The 1923 D-9 monoplane was named in honour of Karl Kotzenberg, sometime Consul General to Norway, who had provided financial support for the project. It was the most advanced glider of its day and had the highest aspect ratio (initially 16.66) of any existing aircraft. The Konsul was a wood framed aircraft with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed 3-ply covering from the spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. It was built in three parts, an 8 m (26 ft 3 in) inner section with a box spar and outer panels with an I-section one. The wing had a thick and strongly cambered profile, using the then new G√∂ttingen 535 airfoil with its high lift to drag ratio that attracted many pre-World War II sailplane designers. The long wings had constant chord except for tapered tips, where the wing decreased in thickness. There was no dihedral. Half span, large area ailerons had angled hinges attached to the spar at its tip and, in the early flight tests, projected well beyond the fixed wing tip. These proved both heavy in flight and vulnerable on the ground, so were soon tapered and rounded off, slightly reducing the span and aspect ratio. The ailerons operated differentially, upward deflections being smaller than downward ones; this was a relatively new way of reducing adverse yaw but in addition the rudder and ailerons were interconnected. Small rudder deflections did not affect the ailerons but larger ones moved them appropriately. No flaps, airbrakes or spoilers were fitted, normal for the time The fuselage of the Konsul was a 3-ply skinned, oval cross sectioned semi-monocoque, with a blunt nose and slightly tapered and more rounded towards the tail. The open, unscreened cockpit was well ahead of the wing, which was mounted directly on top of the fuselage. A short undercarriage skid was attached to the fuselage underside via rubber blocks, aided by a small tailskid. The empennage was fabric covered, straight edged with angled tips; the fin and tailplane had narrower chord than the generous control surfaces and slight sweep on their leading edges. The rudder, which reached down to the bottom of the fuselage, moved within a cut-out in the elevators. Operational history The D-9 Konsul first flew in 1923 and took part in both the 1923 and 1924 Rh√∂n events. In 1923 the Konsul, flown by Albert Botsch, one of its designers, won the distance prize with a record breaking flight of 18.7 km (11.6 mi). In 1925 it won the distance prize again, piloted by Johannes Nehring. Nehring set another distance record that year with a flight of 24.4 km (15.2 mi) during a visit to the Crimea, hill soaring as before. The Konsul remained active until 1927 when it was destroyed in an accident.

He was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea and educated at Bradford Grammar School. A pupil of Thea King, Lawson was a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain during his teenage years. He subsequently read music at Keble College, Oxford. Postgraduate studies in music at the University of Birmingham saw Lawson awarded an MA in 1972 for his study of the clarinet in eighteenth-century repertoire. His pioneering doctoral research into the chalumeau was completed at the University of Aberdeen in 1976. In 2000, in recognition of his work across theory and practice, Lawson received a DMus from the University of London. In 2015, celebrating Lawson's pre-eminence in performance studies, the University of Sheffield awarded him an HonDMus. Following academic positions in Aberdeen and Sheffield, Lawson was appointed to the Chair of Performance Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London in 1998. Between 2001 and 2005 he was Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of the London College of Music & Media at Thames Valley University (now the University of West London). In July 2005 he became Director of the Royal College of Music, London, where he holds a Personal Chair in Historical Performance. Lawson is internationally recognised as a performer of chalumeaux and historical clarinets, having held principal positions with leading British period orchestras, notably The Hanover Band, The English Concert and the London Classical Players, with whom he recorded extensively and toured world-wide. Described as 'a brilliant, absolutely world-class player' (Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung) and ‚Äòthe doyen of period clarinettists‚Äô (BBC Music Magazine), he has appeared as soloist in many international venues, including London's major concert halls and New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Carnegie Hall. His extensive discography comprises concertos by Fasch, Hook, Mahon, Mozart, Spohr, Telemann, Vivaldi and Weber, as well as a considerable variety of chamber and orchestral music. Among recent recordings are two discs of sonatas by Xavier Lef√®vre and a highly acclaimed CD of the Mozart Clarinet Quintet and other fragments. Lawson has an especially close association with Mozart‚Äôs Clarinet Concerto K622, which he performs regularly on both modern and historical instruments. In addition to directing performances of the work, he has played it in collaboration with conductors such as Roy Goodman, Christopher Hogwood, Roger Norrington and Joshua Rifkin. Lawson‚Äôs Cambridge Handbook to Mozart‚Äôs Clarinet Concerto (1996) examines the work‚Äôs genesis, composition and construction, as well as the career of the dedicatee Anton Stadler and his innovative basset clarinet. His first monograph, The Chalumeau in Eighteenth-Century Music, was published in 1981 by UMI Research Press, and remains the most extensive study of the instrument and its repertoire. Amongst later publications for Cambridge University Press are The Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet (1995), a Cambridge Handbook to Brahms‚Äôs Clarinet Quintet (1998) and The Cambridge Companion to the Orchestra (2003). With Robin Stowell he initiated the series of Cambridge Handbooks to the Historical Performance of Music, including their joint introductory volume (1999) as well as his own volume on the early clarinet (2000). The Cambridge History of Musical Performance edited by Lawson and Stowell was published in February 2012. Their most recent volume, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Historical Performance in Music, was published in September 2018.

Overview on Mus√©e d'Orsay website this painting has another two versions, currently housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery of Buffalo, New York. Daumier lived on the Quai d'Anjou on the √éle Saint-Louis, and had plenty of opportunities for observing the attitudes of the washerwomen returning from the lavoir on the Seine, as they wearily climbed the stone steps, bent beneath the weight of their bundles of washing. Nevertheless, there is a strength as well as fatigue expressed in the body of this mature woman, accompanied by her child, whom there is evidently nobody to mind at home. The summary handling of the paint avoids any suggestion of anecdote and gives a monumental quality to this little picture. As said, Daumier painted several variations on this theme: numerous replicas of them exist, some apocryphal. The Louvre-acquired work appears, according to critics, to be far the best.

Parker, Sr.,‚Äù Evening Outlook, Sep. 13, 1958, Santa Monica, CA. Education Parker was born in Chicago, Illinois and attended Harvard Medical School. At the time, it appears that medical students went into the poorer districts of Boston and provided medical care as part of their training. Parker did this and delivered seven babies. The medical courses that interested him most were those on the throat and vocal organs, which he studied under a prominent authority, Dr. Joseph Goodale. While at Harvard, Parker contracted a severe case of typhoid fever, which resulted in his discontinuing medical school and giving up medicine as a profession.Brewer, Wilmon. A Life of Maurice Parker, pp. 17-18, Marshall Jones Company, Francestown, NH, 1954. Marksman While in medical school, Parker joined the First Corps Cadets, which was part of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. Entering as a private, he became successively sergeant, battalion adjutant, and captain and inspector of rifles. For several years he was the leader of the rifle team, and was considered one of the most effective instructors in the country. The team from First Corps defeated not only all others in the militia, but also those representing the regular army and the navy. Parker himself set a world‚Äôs record on some targets. These targets were subsequently changed, and the record has never been equaled.Brewer, Wilmon.

Biographer Brewer states flatly that Parker ‚Äúwas the best dramatic coach in Boston.‚Äù Parker's pupils included performers in the Metropolitan Opera Company, ministers and actors. Pupils came to his Boston studio from as far away as New York. Physicians referred patients to him who had throat problems caused by faulty public speaking or singing. Parker also taught at the New England Conservatory of Music, and Beaver Country Day School, which is a private college- preparatory school in Brookline, MA.Brewer, Wilmon.

Sometimes this financing is funded from outside of the firm or from individual lawyer's finances, and then funneled through a third-party company. Financing is often for plaintiffs involved in personal injury, workers' compensation, and civil rights. The industry provides litigants with cash in a lump sum form upfront in exchange for a share of the litigant's future settlement or trial award. While the litigant awaits the resolution of their case, the legal financing industry provides for immediate relief from financial burdens such as mortgage payments, rent, medical bills, educational bills, daily expenses, or even legal fees. History Legal financing is a fairly recent phenomenon, beginning on or around 1997. Lending to plaintiffs began as part of a trend in which banks, hedge funds, and private investors put money into other people‚Äôs lawsuits. While every case is different, legal financing companies generally only advance 10% to 15% of the likely settlement. On the other hand, legal financing companies charge high fees for the advances that they provide. The American Legal Financing Association (ALFA) was established in New York City as a nonprofit in July 2004 and it represents about 20 legal funding companies nationwide for personal injury victims. The organization's main goals are to establish voluntary standards for the legal financing industry, and to advocate on behalf of the industry. State legislation As of 2011 the industry was lending plaintiffs over $100 million a year and remained unregulated in most states. Commentators have noted that the industry is free to ignore laws that protect consumers who borrow from other kinds of lenders. The industry, however, asserts that they are not lenders because plaintiffs are not required to repay the money if they lose their cases. The industry refers to the transactions as investments, advances, financing or funding, as opposed to loans. This is an argument that has persuaded regulators in many states, including New York, that lawsuit lenders are not subject to existing lending laws. The companies and lawyers who support the industry have also lobbied state legislatures to establish rules like licensing and disclosure requirements. In 2003, the Ohio Supreme Court struck down a legal financing agreement. A legal financing company advanced $7,000 to a woman injured in a car accident. The woman prevailed, and the company was allowed to claim over $30,000 of her future winnings. The court refused to allow this, noting that an \\"intermeddler is not permitted to gorge upon the fruits of litigation\\". This decision was superseded five years later, when the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation that made lawsuit funding legal. The industry has obtained lobbying victories in many other states. In Texas, the industry fought a bill introduced in 2005 that would have subjected litigation financing to the same standards as loans. The bill was ultimately defeated. There was similar success in Ohio, where a bill legalizing lawsuit lending passed in 2008 with little or no opposition. In 2009, the industry also defeated efforts by Maryland legislators that would have reined in lawsuit funding. Maine and Connecticut allow litigation funding by statute, and similar legislation is pending in Kentucky. Furthermore, courts in Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Mississippi, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, and New Hampshire have allowed litigation funding contracts.

This plant is a deciduous shrub usually growing up to 2.1 meters tall, sometimes reaching 3 meters.Physocarpus malvaceus. International Institute of Tropical Forestry. It can form dense thickets. The branches are hairless, and older ones have shreddy bark. The leaves have three to five lobes and serrated edges. Dark green when mature, they turn brownish red by early fall. The inflorescence is a corymb of flowers that have white petals measuring about 4 millimeters in length. The fruit is a follicle roughly one centimeter long.Physocarpus malvaceus. Washington Burke Museum. This shrub grows in forests, woodlands, and oak scrub. The forests are dominated by subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), grand fir (A. grandis), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). It is associated with plant species such as oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), mountain snowberry (S. oreophilus), white spirea (Spiraea betulifolia), serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), Oregon-grape (Mahonia repens), and pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens). This shrub is codominant with Douglas-fir in a common plant community. This shrub is a pioneer species that increases after disturbance and decreases as the overstory grows back and shades it out. It grows rapidly after events such as wildfire, sprouting up from its rhizomes. It is considered a \\"fire-resistant\\" plant. It survives fire and resprouts, becoming more common on burned sites than unburned. This is not a favored food plant among wild and domesticated herbivores. It does provide good cover for small animals. The Dusky Flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) nests in it. This plant is known to hamper regeneration of forest habitat after disturbance such as fire or logging. It outcompetes new conifer seedlings. It is controlled with herbicide spray in some regions.

Biography He came to the United States with his parents in 1851. His father settled in Cincinnati and was the first to introduce terra cotta works of art into the U.S. The son began his professional career by modeling clay in his father's studio. He later studied under a portrait painter in Memphis, Tennessee, and in 1868 went to Paris, where he studied with Joseph Cabasson and Isadore Pils, and was a pupil at the √âcole des Beaux Arts. At the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, he went to Belgium, studying in Brussels and Antwerp under Stalleart and Robert. He moved to Rome in 1871, where he executed his first important work. He returned to Memphis in 1873, painting portraits and figure pieces in oil and watercolors. In 1874 he moved to St. Louis, where he was connected with the art department of Washington University, and assisted Halsey Ives in the organization of the St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts where he taught the life class from 1876 until 1884. He sent his ‚ÄúEcce Homo‚Äù and his ‚ÄúAwakening of Spring‚Äù to the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, receiving a medal and certificate for the latter work. In 1884, he went to Paris to study in the Academie Julian. Here he became versed in the Symbolist school and studied with Gustave Boulanger and Joseph Lefebvre. He participated in the annual Paris salon. In 1896 he did a mural for the Library of Congress, and stayed in Washington, D.C. for the rest of his life.

After the Battle of Kaiapit on 20 September 1943, in which the 2/6th Independent Company won a stunning victory against a numerically superior Japanese force, Ivan Dougherty's 21st Infantry Brigade of the 7th Division advanced from Kaiapit to Dumpu in the Ramu Valley. During the entire advance, the Australian and American forces in the Ramu Valley were supplied by air. The capture of the Ramu Valley allowed a forward airbase to be developed at Gusap.  Background   Geography  The Markham Valley is part of a flat, elongated depression varying from wide that cuts through the otherwise mountainous terrain of the interior of New Guinea, running from the mouth of the Markham near the port of Lae, to that of the Ramu some away. The two rivers flow in opposite directions, separated by an invisible divide about from Lae. The area is flat and suitable for airstrips, although it is intercut by many tributaries of the two main rivers. The area around the divide was the largest area in New Guinea bereft of forest cover, and was passable by vehicles. Between the Ramu Valley and Madang lay the rugged and aptly named Finisterre Ranges.  Military situation  In the wake of the landing at Nadzab on 5 September 1943, and the subsequent capture of Lae on 16 September 1943, Major General George Alan Vasey's 7th Division moved on to the next task assigned by the Commander in Chief, South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, in the June 1943 directive that outlined Operation Cartwheel. This entailed protecting the area it had secured around Nadzab to allow airfields to be developed there, along with the existing airfields around Goroka and Bena Bena. At the Battle of Kaiapit on 20 September 1943, the 2/6th Independent Company won a stunning victory against a numerically superior Japanese force. With the Japanese off-balance, Vasey informed his superior, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, the commander of I Corps, of his intention to advance up the Markham Valley to the Ramu Valley, down the Ramu Valley to Marawasa, and finally to Dumpu. There was some debate amongst the air and engineer generals about the relative merits of airfield sites around Kaiapit and Marasawa, but Vasey intended to seize them all in any case. Australian intelligence correctly identified the opposing Japanese forces as belonging to 78th Infantry Regiment, along with one company of the 80th Infantry Regiment. This was known to the Japanese as the Nakai Detachment, after its commander, Major General Masutaro Nakai. In contrast, the Japanese did not identify the Australians as belonging to the 7th Division. At Kaiapit, Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, the commander of the 21st Infantry Brigade, had the 2/16th Infantry Battalion, the 2/6 Independent Company and B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. While it was possible that the Australian force at Kaiapit under could be facing the entire Japanese 20th Division, Dougherty did not think that the Japanese could support such a large force in the upper Markham Valley. Lieutenant Colonel W. T. Robertson, Vasey's GSO1, told Dougherty that he had until 4 October to reach Dumpu, as no fighter cover would be available from 10 to 20 October, and therefore there would be no air transport operations to resupply him. A message from Vasey received at 00:50 on 23 September ordered Dougherty not to make \\"any further movement in strength\\". The rebuff at Kaiapit and the landing at Finschhafen on 22 September caused Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi, the commander of the Japanese Eighteenth Army (and therefore Herring's opposite number) to change his plans. He had originally intended that the 51st Division would retire from Lae along the southern slopes of the Finisterre Range, through Kaiapit, and thence into the upper Ramu Valley; but Vasey had anticipated this, and had blocked the route. The 51st Division's commander, Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano, then decided to withdraw over the steep and rugged Saruwaged Range. This meant that the Nakai Detachment was not covering the 51st Division's withdrawal, and that there was no need to recapture Kaiapit. On 23 September, Adachi therefore ordered Nakai to withdraw to Dumpu, while the rest of the 20th Division moved against Finschhafen.  Battle   Sagerak  Kaiapit, New Guinea, 25 September 1943. Vasey and Dougherty discuss battle plans Lieutenant Colonel F. H. Sublet's 2/16th Infantry Battalion, a unit from Western Australia, arrived at Kaiapit on 22 September. It set out at 15:00 that afternoon, crossing the Maniang River, which had a series of channels, extending across . Its patrols attempted to locate the Japanese, as did aircraft from No. 4 Squadron RAAF. Only one saw any, the 12 Platoon, under Lieutenant J. R. Walder, which spotted three Japanese soldiers on the far side of the Umi River who fled when fired upon. Wallder's 12 Platoon, and 17 Platoon under Captain K. McCullough, crossed the Umi, which was about wide, up to deep at the crossing point, and swift-flowing, and headed for Sagerak. The 2/27th Infantry Battalion, a South Australian unit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J. A. Bishop, arrived at Kaiapit on the morning of 23 September, having flown directly from Jacksons and Wards at Port Moresby in 45 USAAF C-47 transport aircraft, escorted by P-47 Thunderbolt, P-38 Lightning and P-39 Airacobra fighters. The first C-47 arrived at Kaiapit at 09:00 and the last at 10:50. Each took about ten minutes to unload all its troops and stores. The 2/27th took over the defence of Kaiapit from the 2/6th Independent Company. No aircraft arrived on 24 September, leaving Dougherty without the 2/14th Infantry Battalion, which was still back at Nadzab, and with only the rations and ammunition that the 2/16th and 2/27th had brought with them. The pioneer platoon of the 2/16th strung a rope across the Umi River, allowing the heavily equipped diggers of B and C Companies to cross the fast-flowing torrent. They were across by 12:30, but the entire 2/16th did not complete the crossing until 20:00. On the other side, contact was made with Japanese units, and 12 Platoon came under light machine gun fire, but drove the Japanese off with its 2-inch mortars. When 17 Platoon was engaged by light machine guns, it used its 2-inch mortars to lay smoke, allowing it to withdraw. By 14:40, the leading platoon, 10 Platoon under Lieutenant W. J. Duncan, was overlooking Sagerak, but Duncan was wounded by a sniper at 17:00. Sublet ordered B Company to halt on the high ground, with the intent of attacking Sagerak the next day. 2/27th Infantry Battalion in the Ramu Valley on 5 October 1943 At 20:30, just a half-hour after it had completed the crossing of the Umi, the 2/16th received orders from Dougherty to pull back. With considerable lack of enthusiasm, the 2/16th re-crossed the Umi, this time in the dark. Re-crossing commenced at 03:00 and was completed by 08:00. Lieutenant R. G. Crombie's 11 Platoon was left behind on the high ground overlooking Sagerak. It entered Sagerak that morning, and found it deserted. About 16 Japanese soldiers fled when upon their approach, leaving behind their documents, medical stores and equipment. Lieutenant Everette E. Frazier, an American aviation engineer, pegged out a landing strip nearby and had it ready to receive C-47s in four hours. Vasey flew into Kaiapit to talk to Dougherty. He explained that the reason for halting the 2/16th was an appreciation that Adachi would persist with his original plan, known to the Australians through documents captured at Kaiapit, even though it had been overtaken by events. Vasey believed that the open area between the Umi and Kaiapit would be an excellent place to destroy the Japanese force, should it choose to attack. He therefore proposed to halt for a while, reinforcing the position at Kaiapit with Brigadier Kenneth Eather's 25th Infantry Brigade rather than displacing it forward as originally intended. Dougherty flew over the area in a Douglas SBD Dauntless, and concurred with Vasey's assessment of the ground, although not with his appreciation of the enemy's intent.  Gusap  The 2/14th Infantry Battalion, a Victorian unit, along with the 54th Battery of the 2/4th Field Regiment, finally flew in to Kaiapit from Nadzab on 25 September, but the first elements of the 25th Infantry Brigade did not arrive for another two days. Part of the problem was that the Fifth Air Force restricted landings at Kaiapit to between 09:00 and 15:30 the previous day in order to conserve fighters. Vasey met with Iven Mackay (commander of New Guinea Force), Herring, Frank Berryman (Mackay's chief of staff), George C. Kenney (commander of Allied Air Forces) and Arthur S. Carpender (commander of Allied Naval Forces) in Port Moresby on 26 September. Vasey was informed that the construction of the Markham Valley Road from Lae to Nadzab and operations around Finschhafen had priority, and his 18th Infantry Brigade would not be flown in except in the event of an emergency. The pause allowed a native labour force to be collected at Kaiapit. Some 300 were flown in from Nadzab, and ANGAU hired local labour to bring the total labour force to about 600. Flying Officer R.D. Lee-Warner with members of No. 4 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron's ground staff who are attaching containers to the bomb racks on a CAC Wirraway at Gusap. There was mounting evidence that the Japanese were retreating and not advancing. On 26 September, Crombie reported that Rumu was unoccupied. The following day, patrols from the 2/6th Independent Company and B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion reported that Narawapum was also deserted. That evening, Vasey signalled Dougherty, authorising an advance on Marawasa \\"with all speed\\". The 21st Infantry Brigade set out accompanied by the Papuan company, and detachments of the 2/6th Field Ambulance and 2/4th Field Regiment. Six jeeps hauled rations, four carried the brigade headquarters and signals, three brought the 2/6th Field Ambulance, and two towed 25 pounders. On 28 September, two companies of the 2/16th crossed the Umi. After dusk, the rest of the 21st Infantry Brigade followed, crossing in five rubber rafts. The jeeps and light guns were dragged across the Umi, leaving three behind to form a shuttle service that moved stores from Kaiapit. They were taken across the river and thence to a dump at Sagarak. By the morning of 30 September, all the stores were across the river. The track became impassable about beyond Sagerak, requiring some work to be done to improve it. The airstrip at Sagerak was put to use, with four more jeeps and trailers, and some supplies flown in. Vasey also flew in, bringing new, written orders for an advance on Gusap. By this time, Herring knew that the rest of the Japanese 20th Division was on the Rai Coast and not in the Marawasa area, so Vasey was opposed only by its 78th Infantry Regiment. Bena Bena was garrisoned by the 2/2nd and 2/7th Independent Companies. These patrolled ahead of the 21st Infantry Brigade's advance. On 28 September, a heavily armed patrol from the 2/7th Independent Company under Captain D. St A. Dexter ambushed about 60 Japanese soldiers near Kesawai in the Ramu Valley, inflicting severe casualties on the Japanese. Although native porters were engaged to bring rations forward to the troops, the 2/16th and 2/27th advanced so fast on 1 October that stores had to be dropped by air. The drop was made at 19:00 but owing to poor light, the long grass and inadequate marking of the drop zone, only half the stores were retrieved. The following day they reached the juncture of the Ramu and Gusap Rivers.  Dumpu  Dougherty rested his men on 3 October (which was a Sunday). The men relaxed and swam in the Ramu and Gusap Rivers. Patrols were sent out, however. One patrol from the 2/16th under Lieutenant L. D. Bremner was ambushed near village of Namaput, with one Australian being killed. The patrol attacked the village and killed seven Japanese making for the nearby foothills. The patrol then came under heavy fire itself, and had to withdraw back to the village. Three Australians were wounded, including Bremner, one fatally; 14 Japanese soldiers were killed. The pause gave time for the administrative elements to catch up. The road had held up progress on 1 October due to the need to bridge a stream at Marawassa. It was then found that the road on the far side was impassable, so a bypass was made, allowing them to move to an area near Arafagan Creek, on the banks of the Ramu River. Under Frazier's supervision, the 2/27th established an airstrip nearby. An air supply drop was made there on the afternoon of 2 October. Ramu Valley, New Guinea. 26 October 1943. Australian troops in their victorious push along the Markham and Ramu valleys cross a bridge over the Gusap River. This bridge was built in a few hours. The 21st Infantry Brigade set out again on 4 October, with the Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner's 2/14th heading for Wampun while the 2/16th advanced on Dumpu, crossing the Gusap on a bridge that had been built the previous day. The 21st Infantry Brigade headquarters moved to Kaigulan II. The 2/6th Field Ambulance opened a dressing station there. A Details Issue Depot (DID) was established to the west of the Warris River, from which rations were issued. The 2/14th reached an unoccupied Wampun at 14:00. Honner found that the native porters accompanying his battalion had no water, and were therefore not only thirsty, but hungry as well, as they could not cook their rice rations. If no water could be found in the vicinity, he would have to arrange for water to be sent by jeep from Kaigulan II, or else move the whole battalion on to the next day's objective. Honner set out with Sergeant T. G. Pryor and three privates to see if he could find water in A Company's area around Koram. At around 15:00, they came across a banana plantation, and saw troops moving around in it. They assumed that they were from A Company, but when they approached they were fired on, and Honner and Pryor were both wounded. Pryor, wounded in the throat and chest, attempted to drag Honner, who was wounded in the thigh and could not move easily, but Honner ordered him to return to get help. Private W. H. G. remained to protect Honner; the other two privates accompanied Pryor. Pryor reached D Company, whose commander, Captain G. O. O'Day, immediately set out with Lieutenant A. R. Avery's 16 Platoon. Avery found Honner, covered in blood and black ants. Honner refused to be carried out under fire, as this might endanger the stretcher bearers. Instead, he used Avery's radio to arrange an attack on the banana plantation by A, C and D Companies, which was delivered at 18:00. While the fighting was going on, the stretcher bearers tended to Honner's wounds, and carried him back. Seven Australians were wounded in the action, including Honner, who was flown out from Gusap the next day; 26 Japanese soldiers were killed, and one, wounded, was taken prisoner. Water was found in the A Company area, although some was also sent forward by jeep. The wounded, including Honner, were taken to the dressing station at Kaigulan II by jeep. The last one did not arrive until after midnight. Meanwhile, the main body of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion had crossed the Surinam River by 15:15. Lieutenant J. Scott's 18 Platoon scouted towards Dumpu, but reported at 16:40 that it was still occupied. Major W. G. Symington then brought the rest of D Company forward for an attack on the village. There was no opposition, although one Japanese straggler was killed. They found food, clothing and ammunition, and, in the latrines, evidence of dysentery among the Japanese troops. D Company had Japanese rice and tinned fish for its evening meal.  Aftermath  Despite various obstacles, the 21st Infantry Brigade advanced from Kaiapit to Dumpu, which it had captured on the original target date. The Japanese had not delayed it, nor relieved the pressure on the 51st Division. Japanese plans for capturing Bena Bena had to be permanently shelved. An airstrip was developed at Dumpu, which would assume great importance in the logistical support of the subsequent fighting in the Finisterres. Between 15 September and 5 October, the 21st Infantry Brigade reported 5 dead and 8 wounded. Another 34 men were evacuated sick with malaria, and 85 with fever, mostly scrub typhus. By 1 November, however, another 318 were evacuated with malaria and 327 with fever, many of whom had contracted it in this campaign. After some debate, the engineers decided to build an advanced base for two fighter groups and a medium bombardment group near the junction of the Ramu and Gusap Rivers, at a site called Gusap. The US 872nd Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion was flown in to develop it. This unit had air-portable equipment for just such a mission. With the exception of the 2¬Ω-ton trucks, 3¬Ω-ton carryalls and D4 tractors, which made the trek overland, all equipment was flown in by C-47s. Initially the engineers attempted to improve the existing strip, which they called No. 1, but this site was found unsuitable for large volumes of traffic, so another site was selected away, which became No. 2. This location proved suitable for more airstrips. To construct an all- weather strip, the US 871st Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion was flown in from Nadzab. The all-weather strip was completed by January 1944, at which time the two battalions were joined by a third, the US 875th Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion. Machine gunners from the 6th Machine Gun Battalion were deployed to the airfield in a defensive role. The US 49th Fighter Group's 8th Fighter Squadron, equipped with P-47s, moved to Gusap on 29 October 1943, followed by the P-40s of the 7th Fighter Squadron on 16 November, and the P-47s of the 9th Fighter Squadron on 16 December. The 35th Fighter Group's 39th Fighter Squadron and 41st Fighter Squadron, also equipped with P-47s, followed on 27 and 31 January. The A-20s of the 312th Bombardment Group joined them in December and January. The base at Gusap \\"paid for itself many times over in the quantity of Japanese aircraft, equipment and personnel destroyed by Allied attack missions projected from it\\".

Background The term originates from research by Rex Briggs in 1997, when he was conducting exposed/control experiments with online advertising for Ford Fiesta in the UK. Even though the online ad banners had only a picture of a person blowing bubble gum and the Ford Fiesta logo, exposure to the advertisement increased perceptions of safety. \\"This baffled American analyst: How could this banner ad, which contained only an odd picture and the Ford logo, convince anyone that Ford is a safe car?\\" Digging further, Briggs learned that simultaneously, TV, print and outdoor campaign featured the same person blowing bubble gum, and explaining the safety features, including airbags. The exposure to the online advertising, Briggs concluded, was reinforcing the messaging already received in other media. As Briggs and Stuart explain in the book What Sticks, Why Advertising Fails and How to Guarantee Yours Succeeds, the underpinnings of how surround sound marketing works is based on the idea of \\"imagery transfer.\\" In 1968, researchers established that the brain will \\"replay\\" imagery when reminded of it in other forms. In What Sticks, Briggs and Stuart presents research from Unilever Dove Nutrium campaign across TV, Online and magazine that effectively uses the same core imagery to achieve \\"surround sound marketing\\" success. Briggs and Stuart define surround sound marketing as one of the key principles of marketing success. They write, \\"Just as in a stereo system, one speaker doesn't do it all; instead it's the combination of the woofer, tweeter, and mid range that gives the sound a richness and quality... The same thing applies to marketing. For example, seeing an ad multiple times in the same medium can actually be less efficient than if people see a well-orchestrated advertisement in different media.\\"  Uses of Surround Sound Marketing  Surround sound marketing has become a common term in marketing over the past decade, to wit, \\"Pep Boys CEO Mike Odell noted the company saw a rebound in its service business in the third quarter, helped by its surround sound marketing effort, lower gas prices and pent-up demand, although the company's retail business remained soft\\" (as reported by Forbes). Or, from CMO.com, August 8, 2011, a story entitled Digitally Connecting Through Surround-Sound Marketing. More than 85,000 matches on Google to the phrase \\"surround sound marketing\\" illustrate the move from a research specific idea to a general marketing term.

The three divisional winners and a fourth team‚Äîthe winner of a one- game Wild Card playoff‚Äî played in two series. TBS carried most of the games, with some on MLB Network or TNT. The series used the 2‚Äì3 format for 2012 because on March 2 the league had implemented the new \\"wild card\\" playoff, eliminating the travel day between Games 4 and 5. The 2‚Äì3 format was used for best-of-five Championship Series rounds prior to 1985 and for the Division Series rounds from 1995‚Äì1997. The matchups for the 2012 ALDS were: * (1) New York Yankees (East Division champions, 95‚Äì67) vs. (4) Baltimore Orioles (Wild Card Game winner, 93‚Äì69): Yankees win series, 3‚Äì2. * (2) Oakland Athletics (West Division champions, 94‚Äì68) vs. (3) Detroit Tigers (Central Division champions, 88‚Äì74): Tigers win series, 3‚Äì2. The restriction on teams from the same division meeting in the Division Series was removed prior to the 2012 season. Therefore, the Yankees and Orioles, both from the East Division, were able to meet in the Division Series. Under the format used from 1998-2011, (1) New York would have faced (3) Detroit in one Division Series, and (2) Oakland would have faced (4) Baltimore in the other. This was the third postseason match-up between the Athletics and the Tigers, and previously the Tigers had defeated the A's 4‚Äì0 in the 2006 ALCS. The Yankees and Orioles were meeting in the postseason for the second time; the Yankees had beaten the Orioles 4‚Äì1 in the 1996 ALCS, which witnessed the controversial Jeffrey Maier incident in Game 1\\\\. Matchups New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles Oakland Athletics vs. Detroit Tigers New York vs. Baltimore Game 1 6:07 p.m. (EDT) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland (moved to 8:47 p.m. EDT due to rain delay) The Yankees struck first in the first inning off of Jason Hammel when Derek Jeter singled and Ichiro Suzuki doubled to score Jeter for the game's first run, giving the Yankees a 1‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom of the third inning, Orioles outfielder Chris Davis singled, followed by a Lew Ford single, a Robert Andino sacrifice bunt, and a single by Nate McLouth, to give the O's a 2‚Äì1 lead. Then in the top of the fourth, the Yankees tied the game at two with a Mark Teixeira single with two men on. The game remained tied going into the ninth inning, until a lead-off home run by Russell Martin off of Jim Johnson pushed the Yankees ahead 3‚Äì2. Consecutive singles by Ra√∫l Iba√±ez, Derek Jeter, and Ichiro Suzuki scored Ibanez, giving the Yankees a 4‚Äì2 lead. Robinson Can√≥ doubled to score Jeter and Ichiro. Tommy Hunter relieved Johnson and Nick Swisher hit a sacrifice fly to score Can√≥, making the score 7‚Äì2. The Yankees' C.C. Sabathia pitched innings and after allowing a two-out double to Lew Ford, David Robertson came in to get the final out of the game, giving the Yankees the win and a one-game-to-nothing lead. Game 2 8:07 p.m. (EDT) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland (moved to 8:47 p.m. EDT due to rain delay) The Game 2 pitching matchup was a sharp contrast, pitting postseason veteran Andy Pettitte against rookie Wei-Yin Chen. Similar to the first game, both Jeter and Ichiro would reach base. With two men on and nobody out, Alex Rodriguez hit a sinking line drive which was speared in the air by Robert Andino, who then doubled up Derek Jeter off second. Later in the inning, Robinson Can√≥ ripped a double down the right field line, and Ichiro Suzuki masterfully avoided the tag of Matt Wieters to score, giving the Yankees an early 1‚Äì0 lead. It was all for naught, however, as Pettitte allowed the Orioles to load the bases with two outs on two singles and a walk, then gave up a two-run single to Chris Davis in the third inning. Baltimore tacked on some insurance in the sixth on a Mark Reynolds single. The Yankees threatened in the seventh when Jeter hit a single to make it 3‚Äì2. New York had players on second and third with two out in that inning, but Nick Swisher flied out to end the inning. Jim Johnson got the save to send the series to the Bronx tied at one game apiece. Game 3 7:37 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Baltimore had a 2‚Äì1 lead going into the ninth inning behind a strong performance by Miguel Gonz√°lez. Rookies Ryan Flaherty and Manny Machado became the first pair of rookies to ever homer for the same team in the same game. Machado's blast ranked him as the second youngest player in postseason history, behind the Yankees' own Andruw Jones who had done so against the Yankees while with the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series. Machado also became the youngest nine-hole hitter to homer in a postseason game at 20 years, 96 days. Flaherty's home run in the third off of Hiroki Kuroda put the Orioles up 1‚Äì0 before the Yankees tied the score in the bottom half when Russell Martin doubled with one out and scored on Derek Jeter's triple. Machado's home run in the fifth put Baltimore up 2‚Äì1. Heading to the ninth inning and three outs away from a 2‚Äì1 series deficit, the Yankees sent up Ra√∫l Iba√±ez to pinch-hit for a struggling Alex Rodriguez with one out. Iba√±ez then lined a home run into the right field seats off Orioles closer Jim Johnson to tie the game in the ninth inning. Then in the 12th inning, Iba√±ez crushed the first pitch of the inning into the second deck of Yankee Stadium to win the game and take a series lead in walk-off fashion. Ibanez‚Äôs heroics in this game marked the second time in eight days that he provided the game tying and walk- off hits for the Yankees. During a game against the Red Sox on October 2, 2012, Ibanez hit a game tying 2 run home run off Andrew Bailey in the 9th inning, and then hit a walk-off single off of Andrew Miller in the 12th. At age 40, Iba√±ez set at least four MLB postseason records with his two HRs. Game 4 7:37 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Game 4 was another marathon affair. Joe Saunders and Phil Hughes matched zeroes for four innings, before Nate McLouth led off the fifth for Baltimore with a home run. The Yankees responded in the sixth when Robinson Can√≥ had an RBI groundout, but they left a runner in scoring position in that inning when Alex Rodriguez struck out. Rodriguez also left men on second and third with one out in the bottom of the eighth, dropping his batting average for the series down to .125 and continuing to draw the scorn of Yankees fans. The game remained tied until the 13th inning, when Manny Machado hit a leadoff double off of David Phelps, then scored on an RBI double to J. J. Hardy. Jim Johnson got his second save of the series, ensuring a deciding Game 5 the next day. This was the third time a postseason series had back-to-back games going at least 12 innings, joining the 1986 NLCS and the 2004 ALCS. Game 5 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York The Yankees clinched a trip to the ALCS for the third time in four years with a 3‚Äì1 win. CC Sabathia gave the Yankees his second big performance of the series, pitching a complete game, giving up one run on four hits while striking out nine. The only nervous moments came in the sixth, when a long fly ball by Nate McLouth was ruled foul and the eighth, when the Orioles loaded the bases with one out, but Sabathia got out of the jam by striking out McLouth and getting J. J. Hardy to ground out. The Yankees scored first in the fifth, when Game 3 hero Ra√∫l Iba√±ez singled to score Mark Teixeira, who singled and stole second off of Jason Hammel. The Yankees tacked on some insurance in the sixth, when Derek Jeter walked with an out and scored on an Ichiro Suzuki double, and followed up in the seventh with a Curtis Granderson home run. It proved enough, as the Orioles only scored one run in the eighth on a Lew Ford single with two on. Sabathia got Matt Wieters to ground out for the final out, sending the Yankees to play for the pennant versus the Detroit Tigers. Sabathia was the first Yankee pitcher to pitch a complete game in the postseason since Roger Clemens pitched one against the Seattle Mariners in Game 4 of the 2000 ALCS. Composite line score 2012 ALDS (3‚Äì2): New York Yankees over Baltimore Orioles Oakland vs. Detroit Game 1 6:07 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Coco Crisp led off the game with a home run on Justin Verlander's fourth pitch, a 1‚Äì2 fastball. Verlander threw 26 pitches in the first inning, but he managed to only allow one run. The lead did not last long, as Austin Jackson doubled to lead off the bottom of the first, and moved to third on an infield hit by Quintin Berry. Miguel Cabrera followed with a double play grounder, with Jackson scoring on the play. In the bottom of the third, with the game tied at one, Quintin Berry hit a slow ground ball up the first-base line. A's starter Jarrod Parker fielded the ball, but it rolled out of his glove for an error. That allowed Omar Infante, who doubled earlier in the inning, to score from second base and give the Tigers a 2‚Äì1 lead. Alex Avila led off the fifth inning with a first-pitch homer to extend the Detroit lead to 3‚Äì1. In the top of the seventh, Verlander struck out Derek Norris to tie a playoff career-high in strikeouts with 11, which he set the prior year in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Yankees, which he won. In the bottom of the seventh, with two runners on, Pat Neshek, pitching for the first time since the death of his one-day-old son, got out of the jam by getting Infante to ground into a force out and striking out Austin Jackson. In the top of the eighth, Brandon Moss came close to a game-tying two-run home run off Joaqu√≠n Benoit, but fell just short when the ball held up at the right-field wall for Andy Dirks, who made the catch. Jos√© Valverde pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his first save of the 2012 postseason. He struck out two and got George Kottaras to pop up to end the game. Game 2 12:07 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Oakland took a 1‚Äì0 lead in the top of the third inning when they put together three singles off Tiger starter Doug Fister, with Yoenis C√©spedes' base hit driving in the game's first run. Brandon Moss followed with another single, but Tiger right fielder Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a threw out Coco Crisp at home plate as Crisp was attempting to score from second base. The Tigers tied the score at one in the bottom of the third. Miguel Cabrera hit his second double of the game, moved to third on a single by Prince Fielder, and scored on a slow roller to first off the bat of Delmon Young. Oakland retook the lead in the seventh inning when an RBI single by Cliff Pennington plated Seth Smith, but the lead was short-lived. In the bottom of the frame, Austin Jackson and Omar Infante each hit two-out singles. Miguel Cabrera followed with a short fly ball to center field, which a hard-charging Coco Crisp bobbled and dropped. Jackson and Infante both scored on the error, and the Tigers had their first lead of the game, 3‚Äì2. Detroit reliever Joaqu√≠n Benoit, however, failed to hold the lead in the next inning. Yoenis Cespedes singled and stole both second and third. With one out and the infield in, Benoit threw a wild pitch that scored Cespedes to tie the game at three. Josh Reddick then quickly untied it one batter later, with a home run to right. For the third time in the game, and fourth time in the series, the A's failed to hold a lead in the bottom of an inning that they had gained in the top of the same inning. Delmon Young greeted reliever Ryan Cook with a single, and was lifted for pinch runner Don Kelly. Jhonny Peralta followed with a single, sending Kelly to second. Kelly and pinch runner Danny Worth then moved up on a sacrifice bunt by Andy Dirks. Kelly scored on a Cook wild pitch, knotting the game at four. A's closer Grant Balfour was called upon in the ninth to keep the game tied, but could not succeed. After back-to-back one-out singles by Omar Infante and Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder was intentionally walked, bringing Don Kelly to the plate. Kelly, a .186 hitter during the regular season, delighted the home crowd by hitting a walk-off sacrifice fly to right that plated Infante with the winning run. Al Alburquerque got the win in relief, while Balfour took the loss. Game 3 9:07 p.m. (EDT) at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, California Returning home to Oakland, the A's took a 1‚Äì0 lead for the third time in the series, but this time it would not be relinquished. Coco Crisp led off the first inning with a single, and moved to second on a walk to Stephen Drew. Yoenis C√©spedes followed with an RBI single to center that scored Crisp. Tiger starter An√≠bal S√°nchez avoided further damage by striking out Brandon Moss and getting Josh Reddick to ground into an inning-ending double play. The A's scored one more time off S√°nchez when Seth Smith hit a homer in the fifth, giving the A's a 2‚Äì0 lead. That was all the scoring in this game, as the Tiger hitters could manage only four hits and no runs off starter Brett Anderson and three relievers. Grant Balfour redeemed himself from Game 2 by closing the door on the Tigers in the ninth for his first save of the series. The A's turned in several fine defensive plays as well, highlighted by Coco Crisp's over-the-wall catch in center field on a potential home run off the bat of Prince Fielder. Fielder was victimized later by Yoenis C√©spedes, who robbed the Tiger first baseman of extra bases with a diving catch of a line drive in left-center. Game 4 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, California For the first time in the series, the Tigers took the first lead of the game. In the top of the third inning, Alex Avila doubled off A's starter A. J. Griffin, took third on a sacrifice bunt by Omar Infante, and scored on a single by Austin Jackson. Prince Fielder made it 2‚Äì0 in the fourth with a home run. The A's got one run back in the bottom of the sixth, scoring an unearned run off Tiger starter Max Scherzer. Coco Crisp, who had reached on a Prince Fielder error and advanced to second on a wild pitch, scored on a double by Stephen Drew. Drew, however, was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple. The Tigers got the run back in the top of the eighth. Omar Infante singled, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Austin Jackson, and scored on a single by Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a. Tiger closer Jos√© Valverde was called upon in the ninth to protect the 3‚Äì1 lead, the same lead he had when earning the save in Game 1\\\\. But the A's greeted Valverde with three straight hits. A single by Josh Reddick and a double by Josh Donaldson were followed by a two-run double off the bat of Seth Smith that tied the game at three. It looked like the game might go into extra innings after Valverde got a pop out and a strikeout, but the A's‚Äîwho had a league-leading 14 walk-off wins during the regular season‚Äîwere not done. Coco Crisp hit a two-out, game-winning single to score Smith, sending the home crowd into a wild victory celebration. Game 5 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, California With the series on the line, the teams turned to their Game 1 starters‚ÄîJustin Verlander for the Tigers and Jarrod Parker for the A's. As he had done so many times after a Tiger loss over the last few seasons, Verlander was the Tigers' stopper. The 2011 Cy Young and MVP winner allowed just four hits and a walk in a complete- game shutout, and only one Oakland baserunner made it as far as second base (Josh Donaldson in the eighth). Verlander also struck out 11 batters for the second time in the series, giving him an ALDS record of 22 K's. The Tiger batters did all of their scoring in just two innings. Omar Infante led off the third inning with a single, advanced to second on a wild pitch, and scored on an Austin Jackson double. Jackson advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Quintin Berry and scored on Parker's second wild pitch of the inning. In the top of the seventh, Jhonny Peralta led off with a single and stole second. One out later, Omar Infante singled to send Peralta to third, and Austin Jackson knocked in Peralta with a single off A's reliever Ryan Cook. Quintin Berry drew a walk to load the bases before Cook hit Miguel Cabrera with an 0‚Äì2 pitch to force in the Tigers' fourth run of the game. Prince Fielder followed with a run-scoring single off reliever Jerry Blevins, and Stephen Drew's error on a hard grounder by Delmon Young allowed Berry to score the sixth and final run of the game. The Tigers would move on to the ALCS for the second straight season. This series was an inversion of the 1972 American League Championship Series between the same clubs. In that series. the Athletics won the first two games at Oakland, the Tigers won the next two at Detroit, but the Athletics won the deciding Game 5 2-1 at Tiger Stadium.

The three divisional winners and a fourth team‚Äîthe winner of a one- game Wild Card playoff‚Äîplayed in two separate series. This series with the Washington Nationals was their first playoff berth since moving to Washington D.C. and the first franchise playoff berth since 1981 when they were the Montreal Expos. TBS carried most of the games, with some on TNT. The Wild Card Game was held on October 5, 2012. The series used the 2‚Äì3 format (three consecutive games at home for the team with home field advantage preceded by two consecutive games at home for the other team) for 2012 because Major League Baseball implemented the second wild card slot on March 2, 2012, long after the 2012 regular season schedule had been set, leaving no room for the 2‚Äì2‚Äì1 format which requires a travel day between Games 4 and 5. The 2‚Äì3 format was used for best-of-five Championship Series prior to 1985 and for the Division Series from 1995 to 1997. The matchups for the 2012 NLDS were: * (1) Washington Nationals (East Division champions, 98‚Äì64) vs. (4) St. Louis Cardinals (Wild Card Game winner, 88‚Äì74) * (2) Cincinnati Reds (Central Division champions, 97‚Äì65) vs. (3) San Francisco Giants (West Division champions, 94‚Äì68) Both series saw the first postseason meetings between the respective clubs and both went to the maximum five games. Matchups Washington Nationals vs. St. Louis Cardinals Cincinnati Reds vs. San Francisco Giants Washington vs. St. Louis Game 1 3:07 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri The series opened on a sunny afternoon in St. Louis, before 47,078 fans watching the Nationals' first playoff game since October 19, 1981, when they were the Montreal Expos. It was the first time a team from Washington D.C. played in a postseason contest since the 1933 World Series, when the Washington Senators lost to the Giants. The Nationals struck first on an RBI single by Kurt Suzuki in the second inning with two on off of Adam Wainwright, but the Cardinals responded with two of their own, as 21-game winner Gio Gonz√°lez walked three to load the bases, then threw a wild pitch, before walking another to load the bases and allowing a sacrifice fly to Jon Jay, helping St. Louis score without the benefit of a hit. The score stayed 2‚Äì1 until the top of the eighth, when Tyler Moore delivered a two-out, pinch-hit single off of Marc Rzepczynski to give the Nationals a 3‚Äì2 lead they would not relinquish, both runs charged to Mitchell Boggs, as Tyler Clippard and Drew Storen sealed the deal out of the bullpen for the first playoff win for the franchise in 31 years. Game 2 4:37 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri In Game 2, the Nationals struck first in the top of the second on Ryan Zimmerman's RBI single off of Jaime Garcia, but after back-to- back leadoff singles in the bottom of the inning off of him, David Freese's double and Daniel Descalso's single scored a run each. After a strikeout, Skip Schumaker's groundout and Jon Jay's RBI single made it 4‚Äì1 Cardinals. Allen Craig and Descalso hit home runs in the third and fourth off of Jordan Zimmermann. Pete Kozma walked in the fourth, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on an error on Jay's ground ball. Back-to-back home runs by Ryan Zimmerman and Adam LaRoche in the fourth off of Lance Lynn made it 7‚Äì3 Cardinals. Carlos Beltran's home run in the sixth off of Mike Gonzalez made it 8‚Äì3. The Nationals scored their last run of the game in the seventh on Zimmernan's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third off of Edward Mujica. In the eighth, Komza doubled with one out off of Sean Burnett and scored on Jay's two-out triple, then Beltran's second home run of the game made it 11‚Äì4. After walking Matt Holliday, Burnett was relieved by Tom Gorzelanny, who allowed an RBI double to Craig. Trevor Rosenthal struck out three of the four batters he faced in the ninth as the Cardinals tied the series with a 12‚Äì4 win. Both teams combined to use 13 pitchers, with Lance Lynn working three relief innings to get the win. Game 3 1:07 p.m. (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Washington D.C.'s first playoff game in 79 years was not a pleasant one for the home team. The Nationals were blown out for the second straight game and left 10 men on base‚Äîincluding the bases loaded in the fifth inning‚Äîand didn't even get anyone on in the last three innings. Chris Carpenter ran his postseason record to 10‚Äì2 (2.88 ERA) in 16 postseason starts in 100.0 innings, in seventh place for wins, only one behind Curt Schilling (11‚Äì2, 2.23 ERA) and Greg Maddux (11‚Äì14, 3.27 ERA) for fifth place. He is now tied for fourth place in postseason winning percentage (.833). The Cardinals have won 13 of his 16 starts. He pitched extremely well for St. Louis in only his fourth start since recovering from transplanted nerve surgery on July 19, not starting a game until September 21. He pitched innings without allowing a run in 106 pitches, his season high.Previously in three regular season starts, he threw a high of 92. The Nationals' pitching was shaky. Edwin Jackson surrendered four runs and eight hits in five innings, allowing a two-out single to Matt Holliday in the first and subsequent RBI double to Allen Craig, then a three-run home run to Pete Kozma in the second. The Cardinals added to their lead on Daniel Descalso's sacrifice fly after a hit-by-pitch and double off of Craig Stammen, who increased his ERA in the series to 11.57. Christian Garcia walked Yadier Molina with the bases loaded in the seventh to force in another run, and Ryan Mattheus got two outs in the eighth before allowing a single, double, and two-run single to Holliday to give the Cardinals an 8‚Äì0 lead. Fernando Salas and Joe Kelly pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth respectively to put the Cardinals one win from the NLCS. Game 4 4:07 p.m. (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Nationals had their backs against the wall in this must-win game. Adam LaRoche provided the first offense of the game with a homer for Washington in the bottom of the second off of Kyle Lohse, but the Cardinals manufactured a run in the third inning through a walk, a sacrifice bunt, an error, and a sacrifice fly by Carlos Beltran off of Ross Detwiler. It was 1‚Äì1 for the majority of the rest of the game, as both pitching staffs refused to blink. Ross Detwiler pitched very well for the Nationals, tossing six innings while giving up just three hits and one run. The bullpen, in three innings, combined for eight strikeouts‚Äîafter Detwiler had fanned just three‚Äîand did not give up a hit. St. Louis turned in a similar performance, with Kyle Lohse pitching seven strong innings. In the bottom of the ninth, Jayson Werth, on the 13th pitch of a lead off at-bat against Lance Lynn, lined a homer into left field, giving the Nationals a 2‚Äì1 win and forcing a Game 5\\\\. Game 5 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. In the deciding Game 5, St. Louis clinched a trip to the NLCS for the second straight year. The Nationals jumped out early on off of Adam Wainwright. In the first, Jayson Werth hit a leadoff double and scored on Bryce Harper's triple before Ryan Zimmerman's home run put them up 3‚Äì0. Bryce Harper's leadoff home run in the third made it 4‚Äì0, then Zimmerman doubled before Michael Morse's home run extended the Nationals' lead to 6‚Äì0. With their ace Gio Gonz√°lez on the mound, the Nationals appeared headed towards the NLCS. In the fourth inning, Matt Holliday hit an RBI double after a walk to get the Cardinals on the board. In the fifth, St. Louis scored two more runs on a wild pitch and walk to Allen Craig, but wound up stranding the bases loaded. In the seventh, the Cardinals tacked on another run off Edwin Jackson appearing in relief on two days' rest on Holliday's RBI groundout. The Cardinals continued to chip away at the Nationals' lead when Daniel Descalso homered off Tyler Clippard to make it 6‚Äì5 Washington. The Nationals got a much-needed insurance run in the bottom of the eighth on Kurt Suzuki's RBI single off of Jason Motte, and sent out Drew Storen, who had recently replaced Clippard as the team's closer, in the hopes of getting three outs while stifling the Cardinals' comeback. Storen gave up a leadoff double to Carlos Beltr√°n, who then advanced to third on a Matt Holliday groundout. Allen Craig then struck out, putting the Nationals one out away from going to the NLCS for the first time in 31 years and give Washington, D.C. its first postseason victory since 1924. Yadier Molina, who had had postseason heroics in the past, walked, sending up David Freese as the go-ahead run. Freese, also known for clutch performance in the postseason, also walked. Descalso then hit a two-run single, scoring Beltr√°n and pinch-runner Adron Chambers which tied the game at seven. After Descalso stole second, Pete Kozma hit a two-run single, which scored Freese and Descalso making it 9‚Äì7 St. Louis. Washington went down in order in the bottom of the ninth against Jason Motte, sending the Cardinals to the NLCS for the second year in a row. Composite line score 2012 NLDS (3‚Äì2): St. Louis Cardinals over Washington Nationals Cincinnati vs. San Francisco The San Francisco Giants upset the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds to advance to the 2012 National League Championship Series. The Reds won the first 2 games at San Francisco, but the Giants won the remaining 3 games in Cincinnati to pull off the stunning upset. Game 1 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at AT&T; Park in San Francisco, California Matt Cain and Johnny Cueto faced off against each other for the first time in 2012. Everyone expected a pitchers' duel from the two right-handed aces. In the top of the first, Brandon Belt made an amazing catch, leaping over the fence in foul territory and into the crowd, but holding on for the second out to help Cain pitch a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 inning. In the bottom of the first, however, after Cueto struck out √Ångel Pag√°n and then got ahead in the count 0‚Äì2 on Marco Scutaro, Cueto left the game with back spasms. Sam LeCure replaced him. LeCure got out of a bases-loaded jam in the second inning by getting Cain to line out to deep right. In the top of the third, Brandon Phillips put the Reds up 2‚Äì0 with a two-run home run. After a Jay Bruce home run in the fourth, Buster Posey's home run leading off the sixth off Mat Latos put the Giants on the board. Then, Gregor Blanco bunted with two out. Scott Rolen picked up the ball and threw it away, but Phillips made a great diving stop to keep Blanco off second and the Giants from scoring anymore. In the ninth, the Reds added two runs off of Santiago Casilla with two on via an RBI single from Phillips and a passed ball by Posey. In the bottom of the inning, Aroldis Chapman allowed the Giants to load the bases on a single and two walks and threw a two-out wild pitch that allowed a run to score, but struck out Posey to end the game and seal the Reds' 5‚Äì2 win to take a 1‚Äì0 series lead. This was the first Reds postseason win since 1995, breaking an eight-game losing streak in the postseason. Game 2 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at AT&T; Park in San Francisco, California Game 2 was a blowout. Reds starter Bronson Arroyo gave up just two hits in seven innings, while walking one and striking out four. J. J. Hoover and Jos√© Arredondo combined for two scoreless innings out of the bullpen. In contrast, the Giants' pitching was disappointing, as Madison Bumgarner surrendered seven hits and four runs while working just four innings, including a home run by Ryan Ludwick in the second. In the fourth, Bumgarner allowed two leadoff singles, then one out later, an RBI single to Scott Rolen and two-run single to Ryan Hanigan. Six relievers followed Bumgarner, including Tim Lincecum, who worked two scoreless innings after being demoted to the bullpen, and Guillermo Mota, who surrendered three hits and two runs in just of an inning. The Reds put the game out of reach in the eighth when a leadoff single and subsequent walk was followed by Jay Bruce's two-run double off of Jose Mijares. After Santiago Casilla got one out, Hanigan's single, Drew Stubbs's triple, and Brandon Phillips's double off of Mota scored a run each. The Giants were now in a two-games-to-none hole, while Cincinnati was just one win away from going to the NLCS for the first time in 17 years, with three chances to clinch the series at home. Game 3 5:37 p.m. (EDT) at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio In contrast to Game 2's blowout, Game 3 was a tightly contested affair that came down right to the wire. Cincinnati attacked first on Jay Bruce's RBI single in the first inning off Ryan Vogelsong, scoring Zack Cozart. That would be practically it for the Reds' offense, as the Giants' pitching composed themselves to give up just one hit the rest of the way. Homer Bailey, who had pitched a no-hitter just two starts before, was flirting with another one, not giving up a hit through innings before Marco Scutaro broke it up with a two-strike single. That was the only hit the Giants would get in regulation, as Bailey was brilliant, pitching seven innings while striking out ten. However, the Giants still managed to score a run in the third inning with a hit by pitch, a walk, a sacrifice bunt, and a sacrifice fly. Neither team came close to scoring after that until the 10th inning, when Buster Posey and Hunter Pence got back to back singles to kick off the inning. Jonathan Broxton settled down after that to strike out the next two hitters. After the runners advanced on a passed ball, the usually sure-handed Scott Rolen bobbled a ground ball hit by Joaqu√≠n √Årias, allowing Posey to score. The Reds went down quietly in the 10th inning as the Giants avoided the sweep. Game 4 4:07 p.m. (EDT) at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio In Game 4, needing another win to keep their season alive, the Giants' offense finally came to life. √Ångel Pag√°n hit the second pitch of the night, from emergency starter Mike Leake, over the right field wall for a lead-off home run, the first in Giants postseason history. Pitching for the Giants, Barry Zito struggled early, allowing a two-out single to Joey Votto, then walking three consecutive Reds hitters in the bottom of the first to force in a run. In the second inning, Gregor Blanco hit a two-run home run to give the Giants a 3‚Äì1 lead. Zito continued to struggle, needing 76 pitches to complete just under three innings of work and allowing a home run to Ryan Ludwick in the third that made it 3‚Äì2 Giants. George Kontos relieved Zito that inning. In the fifth, Back-to-back doubles by Joaqu√≠n √Årias and Pag√°n off of Leake, followed by a Pablo Sandoval sacrifice fly off of Sam LeCure gave the Giants a 5‚Äì2 lead. Tim Lincecum struck out six batters in innings for the Giants, ultimately getting the win. In the bottom of the sixth, Drew Stubbs hit a leadoff double off of Lincecum, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Brandon Phillips's sacrifice fly, but in the seventh, Arias hit a leadoff double off of Jose Arredondo, then scored on Marco Scutaro's double before Sandoval's two-run home run made it 8‚Äì3 Giants. Santiago Casilla closed out the game, and the Giants avoided elimination for the second straight night, setting up a decisive Game 5\\\\. Game 5 1:07 p.m. (EDT) at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio The Reds' Mat Latos and the Giants' Matt Cain were locked in a pitchers duel for four innings. In the top of the fifth, Brandon Crawford tripled home Gregor Blanco, who singled to lead off, to open the scoring. Angel Pagan then reached on an error by Zack Cozart, allowing Crawford to score the second run of the inning. After a walk to Scutaro, Sandoval singled to load the bases. Buster Posey then crushed a 2-2 pitch from Latos off the facing of the second deck for a grand slam and a 6‚Äì0 lead. The Reds slowly chipped away the lead. In the bottom of the fifth, a hit-by-pitch and single was followed by Brandon Phillips's two-run double. Next inning, Ryan Ludwick's leadoff home run made it 6‚Äì3. In the ninth, a one-out walk and single was followed by Ludwik's RBI single. The Reds brought the tying run to the plate in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, and the winning run to the plate in the ninth inning. With two men on and the Giants clinging to a two-run lead, Sergio Romo retired Jay Bruce on a harmless fly ball to left after a 12-pitch duel. Romo then settled down and struck out Scott Rolen to give the Giants the victory. The Giants became the second National League team to rally from an 0‚Äì2 Division Series deficit to advance to the Championship Series (the other being the 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers) and first in Major League Baseball to advance by winning three games on the road. Cincinnati joins the 1984 Chicago Cubs and 1981 Houston Astros as the only National League teams to blow a 2‚Äì0 lead in a best‚Äìof‚Äìfive series. This series also joins the 2010 ALDS matchup between the Texas Rangers and the Tampa Bay Rays as the second MLB postseason series in which the road team won every game. The Reds to date have yet to win a postseason game at Great American Ball Park (0-4) and have a seven-game home losing streak in the postseason, losing their last three postseason games at Riverfront Stadium/Cinergy Field, including the 1999 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game to the New York Mets.

In conjunction with the P Motors, the Rs marked the second generation of electric locomotives built for the New York Central. Also like the P Motors they used advanced nose suspended traction motors and the R-2s were some of the first North American locomotives to make use of the C-C wheel arrangement, which later became the standard for diesel electric road freight. The first R Motor was developed as a response to the Kaufman Act which banned steam locomotive use throughout the city and required the New York Central to eliminate street running along its 10th Avenue freight route. After evaluating the first R class prototype for freight service, a modified design of 42 additional class R-2 locomotives were ordered and spent their careers working out of the limelight hauling freight on the West Side Freight Line and other portions of the electrified zone. Later, a few R-2s were sent for Detroit River Tunnel service to supplement the aging steeplecab electric locomotive fleet until a new ventilation system for diesel operations was installed in 1953. In the 1950s some Rs were sold to the Chicago, South Shore and South Bend for freight service on that road. History In order to comply with the Kaufman Act, the New York Central railroad was faced with the elevation and electrification of its extensive West Side freight services, which served a busy waterfront and industrial area. Its previous electrification project into Grand Central Terminal in 1906 had consisted mainly of passenger operations and thus the railroad had no dedicated electric units for freight service. In 1926 the NYC ordered a prototype freight locomotive from ALCO-GE which was able to make use of lighter electric motors that could be geared to the axles instead of being built around them in the Bi-polar type design. The prototype, classed R, consisted of two semi- permanently coupled units numbered 1200-1201, each with a B-B wheel configuration and 4 500 hp traction motors. Total length was only 68 feet as the unit was anticipated to need a tight turning radius to work the new West Side elevated line. After several years of testing a simpler, single unit design was chosen for mass production with a C-C wheel arrangement that provided more pulling power than B-B, but without the complexity of the 4 bogie design. The new class of 42 C-C locomotives was classed R-2 and numbered 1202-1243 with each providing a more manageable 3000 hp. Design of the cab was very similar to the P-Motors built only a year earlier, but without the long porch line structures in front that supported the leading wheels. The powered trucks of the R-Motors were also nearly identical to those found on the P-Motors. Like many other classes of locomotives, the R-Motors soon found their duties being taken over by the quickly advancing technology of diesel locomotives. The R prototype was converted into a pair of diesel hauled hump trailers in 1945 and the Central began to use the large R-2 fleet in other roles. In the 1940s several were sent to pull trains through the electrified Detroit River Tunnels, returning in 1953 when the tunnels were ventilated for diesel operations. In 1955, ten R-2 Motors were sold to the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad to supplement their electrified freight operations. Seven units, CSS&SB;(701-707) were rebuilt to use 1500 V DC overhead lines using parts left over from the conversion of the P-Motors to 660 V DC third rail. The front ends were also modified moving the cab door from the front to a more typical side access. The NYC Rs were scrapped in the 1950s and 60s, while the South Shore units survived into the 1970s. None were preserved.

Costain. It is a fictional story set in the 13th century about a young Saxon who journeys to the far-away land of Cathay in search of fortune. Included in this narrative are several notable figures: Roger Bacon, Bayan Hundred Eyes, Edward I of England and his consort Eleanor of Castile. Costain also includes a passage depicting the building of a galere da mercato at the Venetian Arsenal in a single day. Five years after its publication, 20th Century-Fox adapted it into a film of the same name starring Orson Welles, Tyrone Power, and C√©cile Aubry. Plot summary Book One In 1273 in England, Walter of Gurnie is a clerk (student) at medieval Oxford. The illegitimate son of the Norman nobleman Rauf of Bulaire, Earl of Lessford, he has been raised as a Saxon by his mother the Lady Hild and maternal grandfather Alfgar, a belted knight whose lands were confiscated after the Battle of Evesham and given to his bitter enemy, the drunkard lord of Tressling. Walter is in love with Tressling's beautiful daughter Engaine but is below her station. After participating in a student riot (led by new acquaintance Tristram Griffen, son of a fletcher and a chamber-deacon student himself) to rescue two fellow students from being hanged by the local watch, Walter attends a lecture by Friar Roger Bacon and is inspired to journey to the far-away semi-mythical land of Cathay. Walter and Tristram elude a hunt for them as leaders of the riot but Walter learns that his father has been killed by an arrow through the heart. The Countess of Bulaire, known as \\"the Norman woman\\" and the cause of Walter's illegitimacy when she married Rauf (thereby breaking his chivalric vow to Hild), has taken revenge by hanging six commoners without a trial while imprisoning their families. Walter is summoned to Bulaire Castle for the funeral but stops first at Gurnie, where he finds his mother enfeebled and the impoverished Alfgar, against all knightly traditions, in trade collecting discarded metals to sell so that he can make cheese. Tristram seeks him out to warn him that he is going to lead a raid on the Bulaire castle to free the families. After Walter sees that the children have been starved, he devises a plan for Tristram and his men to steal into the castle to rescue the families. The next day Walter encounters Engaine, who tells him she has reluctantly resolved to marry Edmond, Rauf's legal heir and Walter's half-brother. In despair but to no avail he argues that if not for a shipwreck that led Rauf to marry the countess, Walter would be the legitimate heir and marrying Engaine. Walter impulsively makes a vow of devotion to her, echoing Rauf's vow to the Lady Hild many years before. He attends the reading of the will and is bequeathed a pair of boots he has admired since childhood together with an expensive cup. However his father also wills him into the service of King Edward for life, so he decides to flee England, taking Tristram with him. Book Two Walter's inheritance gets them as far as Antioch, where they meet Lu Chung (the \\"Bird Who Feathers His Own Nest\\"), the immense and corrupt Chinese agent of the powerful Greek merchant Anthemus, and are permitted to barter for entry into his service. Impressed by Walter's cleverness and Tristram's physicality, Anthemus makes a place for them on a gift-bearing caravan, including a harem of 81 beautiful women, heading east to the court of Kublai Khan. Anthemus shows his contempt for them by positioning them at the rear of the train, giving them the small black thief Mahmoud ibn Asseult as their servant boy, and providing a poor yurt and equipment borne by sickly camels. On the eve of their arrival in Maragha, where they are to join up with their escort, Mongol general Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and his army of the Ilkhan, one of the women ‚Äì the sister of Anthemus, Maryam (characterized as the Black Rose, a nickname for the spice cloves) ‚Äì escapes the harem. With Lu Chung's help she finds her way to the two Englishmen, who agree to help her escape to a sympathetic relative because they are convinced by her blue eyes that she is half-English. The next day Maryam disappears while Walter and Tris win service with Bayan when Tris recklessly but successfully challenges the Mongol bowmen during an archery contest conducted to keep the restless Mongol warriors busy. They travel with the army now, provided by Bayan with the finest yurt and the best animals, including splendid horses. Maryam has returned, however, finding herself more afraid of her uncle than she had been of Anthemus. Walter agrees to have her travel with them disguised as a dark- skinned servant boy, all three risking the deadly consequences that would follow their being caught by the Mongol general. Additional tension arises when Maryam gives Tris, who speaks only English, lessons in Bi-chi, the Mongolian-based pidgin of the caravan trade, causing Walter (who earlier tried and failed to do so) to resent being left out. Little by little, however, it becomes apparent that Maryam has developed a deep emotion for Walter. The journey east sees Walter curry the favor of Bayan through being a competent chess-player and Tristram demonstrate the power of the English longbow instructing an astonished horde. Unfortunately, the spiteful Mongolian Ortuh the Stammerer learns of their secret, and Walter decides his party must abandon the caravan with Lu Chung. While the rest flee south into China, Walter steers the caravan off course sufficiently to gain time for the runaways' escape. Caught in the act as he is about to escape, he is honest with Bayan ‚Äì who considers him a friend - about his motives but is punished by the Rope Walk, an ordeal that gives a small chance to live. He survives only because the enraged Ortuh violates the rules just as Walter is on the verge of being killed, permitting Bayan to end the punishment. Left behind in the village where he was caught, with Bayan paying for his care, Walter spends two weeks in a semi-coma and many more recuperating from broken bones. He learns that Bayan did not pursue the others, and when it becomes clear that he will recover sufficiently to return to the general, has renewed hope of finding the others in the Sung capital of Kinsai. In the third year after leaving England, Walter rejoins Bayan just as he destroys the Sung navy on the Yangtze River, the last task before taking the capital. Bayan, to spare the great city and its occupants from total destruction, assigns him the mission of accompanying the Sung peace envoy Chang Wu back to Kinsai in the guise of a Western scholar to convince the Chinese to surrender. Once in the Chinese capital, Chang Wu directs a search for Tris and Maryam while Walter meets with \\"men of substance\\" in the city to pursue peace. He finds that Kinsai is overwhelmingly in sympathy with the peace proposals but that the war faction has thus far been able to keep it from the Dowager Empress, the Sung regent. On the day that Walter is to speak with the Dowager Empress, Lu Chung is captured and provides information about the fate of the others. Tris was betrayed by Lu Chung to bandits and probably killed. Almost as dire, the Bird Who Feathers His Own nest has also arranged to sell Maryam back to Anthemus through the corrupt and despotic silk merchant, Sung Yung, who is the power behind the war faction. Walter's conscience, seeing that vows of chivalry are often futile and harmful, compels him to break his vow to Engaine and contrive to wed Maryam in the very clutches of Sung Yung, putting her beyond the power of Chinese magistrates to enforce the criminal transaction. However, as soon as they are married he realizes how completely he loves Maryam. Even better for his mission, the public disgrace of Sung Yung foments a riotous rebellion among the populace who kill the silk merchant and attack the shops of other merchants suspected of wanting war. The ability of common men to exert control on their own destinies, and to work for themselves on their own land, fills Walter with disgust for the feudal system in England. Walter keeps his audience with the Dowager Empress, but unfortunately his blond hair, and the fact that the blond Tris is not dead but also in Kinsai, fulfills an ancient proverb of \\"two birds of golden plumage out of the West\\" whose appearance will end the peril of destruction. The Dowager Empress refuses to surrender. The three are reunited but confined in the Great Interior Palace, prisoners treated as gods, receiving daily gifts, including much jewelry, many gems, and a priceless porcelain vase. The young couple find happiness together in their luxurious Abode of Everlasting Felicity. Knowing the Bayan is near, Walter has a report smuggled out of Kinsai informing the general of the widespread desire for peace and his own confinement. Chang Wu arranges their escape by sea, but other peace forces try but fail to have the Englishmen drowned by the vicious river tide. As a result, Maryam is unable to reach the ship before it departs. Book Three Five years after raiding Bulaire, Tris and Walter return to London, rich with presents from the Dowager Empress. Their legal troubles appear to have become moot; King Edward is, if not a revered monarch, a respected one who considers himself English first, with an obligation to better the lot of the common man. Walter learns that his mother died a year after their departure and that Engaine married Edmond and has a son by him. The new Earl of Lessford is more avaricious and oppressive than even his mother, hanging common men in revenge for the raid and barbarically driving others into banditry until open warfare exists between noble and commoner. Walter turns his share of their wealth into gold to pay his debts and redeem the cup he pawned to finance his adventure. Walter has knowledge of many wondrous inventions from the east‚Äîpapermaking, gunpowder, the telescope, and the compass‚Äîbut proof of their existence and Walter's copious notes of all he'd seen have been left behind during their escape. Walter returns to Gurnie to find his grandfather prospering in trade. Their reunion is disrupted when Engaine comes to Gurnie with her son, seeking sanctuary from her husband. In the meantime, Chang Wu sheltered Maryam following the attempt to drown the Englishmen and after three weeks arranged a ship for her to leave, just a week ahead of Bayan's invaders. Using gems sewn into the hem of her garments, Maryam then made her way with agonizing slowness to India, having given birth in Amboyna along the way to a blond, blue-eyed son she named Walter. Knowing none of the languages of the ports they reached, she used her wealth and the single word \\"London\\" to reach Konkan. As Walter arrives at Gurnie, Maryam, her year-old son and Mahmoud are at last able to gain passage on a ship bound for Aden. Walter offers to provide Engaine support so that she may live in London while petitioning the king for return of her inheritance that Edmond seized when they married. Edmond comes to claim her but Walter with eight archers of Gurnie stands with her and he cowardly backs down. Engaine, knowing Walter is married, calls Maryam a heathen and tries to undermine his marriage vows. Tris becomes the leader of the commoners' resistance. Walter escorts Engaine to Bulaire on the way to London where they discover that Edmond hanging with an arrow in his chest from the same tree that his mother hanged the six commoners five years before. Engaine's infant son is now Earl of Lessford, which restores her estates and makes her more determined than ever to have Walter obtain an annulment from Maryam. Six months later Maryam has reached Venice, finding the Christian city far more hostile and contemptuous than at any of her Eastern stops. But for the first time, communicating in Greek, she is able to relate the story of her escape, reaping the good fortune of being placed on a new Venetian bireme set for its maiden voyage to Marseilles. In Gurnie, Walter begins a paper-making enterprise with his grandfather, whose fortunes continue to prosper when King Edward restores his forfeited lands. Tris, on the other hand, has gone into hiding, a fugitive after the death of Earl Edmond. When one of the paper-makers at last discloses Tris's hiding place, Walter visits him in the wild, craggy valley Scaunder Clough. Before Walter can bring him items for comfort, however, news reaches him that Tris died from a fall shortly after their visit. His grandfather grows frail, without hope of ever seeing his restored lands again, but names Walter his heir by endorsing his plan to give small tracts of their lands to the people living and working on the estate. A year after leaving India Maryam falls deathly ill in Marseilles but is cared for by an old French innkeeper, Pierre Marchus, who feels a responsibility to look after pilgrims traveling through the port. She offers a small pearl, the last of her gems, in hopes it is payment enough to cross France. Months later Walter has a long audience with King Edward, telling him in detail of all he has seen. Though the rest of the court is contemptuous, the king appreciates his story and bestows on him a name, knighting him Sir Walter Fitzrauf. The next morning the queen, Eleanor of Castile, happily tells Walter that a small, sickly woman has been reported in London, wandering the streets and shouting the only other word of English she knows: \\"Walter.\\" His father's former squire brings Walter together with his wife, three-year-old son, and faithful servant Mahmoud. Maryam will recover, and Walter vows to have his son christened \\"Walter Alfgar Edward Rauf Fitzrauf.\\" References * Costain, Thomas B. The Black Rose.

He began his football career with Queens Park in Scotland, performances led to a battle for his signature between Aston Villa & Celtic but not before the likes of Manchester United and Leeds United had courted him. Jamie had agreed in principle to join Aston Villa after a Scottish Cup match against Celtic, but after sustaining a knee injury in this game Villa decided against a move. Soon after Jamie was on a plane to Australia and joined Prahran Slavia in the Victorian State League in 1978. He very quickly marked his arrival leading the Goal scoring for the competition that year with 18 goals. At the end of 1978 Heidelberg United a powerhouse at the time in the National Soccer League signed Jamie for $25,000. Again the transfer fee was repaid in goals, with Jamie joining in round 10 of the 1979 season he scored 5 goals from his first 5 games at NSL level and won the club goal scoring award with 11 that season which saw Heidelberg finish in second place to Sydney City. His Strike Partnership with Gary Cole was nothing less than prolific bringing 77 goals in a season and a half between 1979 & 1980 and being described as one of the best strike pairing's Australia has seen. Jamie was runner up to Gary Cole in the NSL Scoring charts in 1979 & 1980 with 16 and 18 goals respectively. This Partnership along with a star-studded lineup which included 9 of the 11 Socceroos at the time helped Heidelberg to a second-place finish in the 1980 National Soccer League season, and a win in the 1980 NSL Grand Final in which Heidelberg defeated Sydney City 4‚Äì0 in Canberra, Jamie scoring 1 and Gary Cole with a hat trick. Socceroo Honours were to follow in late 1980, joining the Socceroos on their now infamous 1980 world tour. After a disagreement with then Socceroos coach Rudi Gutendorf he was never selected for the National Team again. He continued to score goals at a prolific rate in the NSL and in 92 games with Heidelberg United he scored 42 goals. Many of these against Heidelberg United's biggest rival South Melbourne. 1984 saw a change at the Olympic Village and after a bitter dispute one which not see him return to the club for over 20 years, Jamie was given a free transfer to Footscray J.U.S.T and with Heidelberg struggling to score goals that season Jamie once again proved his worth netting 16 times in his first season with the club. After ankle injuries towards the end of season 84, Jamie had an interrupted 1985 still managing to score goals and help J.U.S.T to their highest ever finish in the NSL. After losing his passion for the game, Jamie was talked into joining Brunswick Juventus for the 1986 NSL season. After only playing 2 NSL Cup games Jamie announced his retirement at the age of only 29. Losing all interest in the game never to pull on the boots again. He is now involved at board level with Heidelberg United in the Victorian Premier League after returning to the club in 2003.

Service Ionic was built by Harland and Wolff, Belfast and launched on 11 January 1883, being delivered to her new owners on 28 March 1883. She was almost immediately chartered for service with the New Zealand Shipping Company, along with the White Star ships and , to fill a gap while the company was awaiting the delivery of new ships. After being inspected by the Prince of Wales, Ionic began her maiden voyage from London to Wellington, sailing via the Cape of Good Hope, in April 1884, setting a new record for the passage. She was placed on the regular joint White Star - Shaw, Savill & Albion route from December 1884, managed by Shaw, Savill & Albion but crewed by White Star Line personnel. She had to be towed to Cape Town after her propeller shaft snapped in 1893, and in 1894 she was extensively refitted by Harland and Wolff.

It is designed to create additional areas of forest reserves in the State of Tasmania, while ensuring ongoing wood supply for the forest industry. It was signed by Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and Tasmania's Premier, Lara Giddings, on August 7, 2011.  Background  Forestry has long been a contentious issue in Tasmania, which is home to the world's first environmental political party, the Tasmanian Greens, reflecting the high level of environmental awareness in the state. The Agreement resulted from Round Table discussions in 2010 between the Tasmania‚Äôs forest industry and environmental movement, which sought to end more than 30 years of animosity between the parties. The main driver of the talks was the decision of Tasmania‚Äôs largest private forestry company, Gunns Limited, to exit native forest harvesting and focus on developing its proposed plantation-based pulp mill at Bell Bay in the north of the State. This decision led to a need to restructure the forest industry, and also created an opportunity to reserve additional areas of native forests. The Round Table discussions culminated in the Tasmanian Forests Statement of Principles to Lead to an Agreement. The Statement of Principles sought support from the Australian and Tasmanian Governments to protect an additional 430,000 hectares of forests claimed by environmental groups to be of high conservation value, while ensuring a sustainable supply of native forest and plantation timbers to the forest industry. The TFIA provided a financial package of AUD 277 million to: * support logging contractors to leave the industry following the decision of Gunns Limited, to exit native forest harvesting; * protect and manage new forest reserves; * fund regional development projects; and * fund mental health counselling and community wellbeing projects. The Agreement also established an Independent Verification Group to assess the conservation values and timber supply requirements from within the areas nominated by the environmental movement for additional forest reserves. All stakeholders involved in the Agreement agreed to the Independent Verification process. In accordance with Clause 36 of the Agreement, the Commonwealth of Australia, the State of Tasmania and the State-owned forest management corporation, Forestry Tasmania, signed a Conservation Agreement that provided interim protection for the areas of forest under assessment, while allowing Forestry Tasmania to meet is contracted wood supply obligations, until the expected conclusion of the process on 30 June 2012.  Signatories  The signatories to the Statement of Principles were, in alphabetical order: * Australian Conservation Foundation * The Australian Forest Contractors' Association * The Construction, Forest, Mining and Energy Union * Environment Tasmania Inc * The Forest Industries Association of Tasmania * The National Association of Forestry * Tasmanian Country Sawmillers' Foundation * The Tasmanian Forest Contractors' Association * Timber Communities Australia Ltd * The Wilderness Society  Current status  The Independent Verification Group delivered its reports on 23 March 2012. The purpose of the reports is to provide the environmental and forestry groups involved in the Agreement with the information required to negotiate a final agreement. The Tasmanian Government was expected to introduce legislation to the State Parliament by 30 June 2012 to implement the final agreement.

Characters   Primary   The Wright Family  * Nate Wright: The comic strip's main character. Nate is in sixth grade and 11 years old, a talented cartoonist, drummer, and chess player. He also believes he is a natural prankster , as he attempts funny and difficult pranks on the second to last day of school (known in the book as \\"Prank Day\\"). He is somewhat vain, believing himself to be irresistible to girls despite being rejected repeatedly by his crush, Jenny Jenkins. He believes he is a brilliant sports player despite his lack of athletic abilities. He also thinks of himself as a genius despite his below-average grades. Nate spends much of his time in detention, in the art room drawing comics, or playing drums for his band, Enslave the Mollusk, which also comprises his friends Francis, Teddy, and Artur. Nate is desperate to own a dog as he is a dog person who is ailurophobic, but rarely gets his wish, as his father does not want to own a dog. He also has ailurophobia, the fear of cats, and hates Figure skating and egg salad, but loves \\"Cheez Doodles\\". Surprisingly, Nate's most well-known talent is that he is a skilled chess-player, to the complete confusion of his friends and family. Nate is also well known as being able to detect vibes. He even tried to teach Chad Applewhite this ability but failed. Nate is also known for having a very accurate sense of smell. * Martin Earl \\"Marty\\" Wright: Nate's father, a bald, overweight divorc√©e who lost his job in the eighth novel of the series (eventually getting another one). Like his son, he is somewhat clueless about his failings and considers himself a professional musician despite his indescribably horrible singing voice and initially poor steel-string guitar playing, an athlete despite his inherent laziness, and an expert golfer, though he constantly cheats or loses his ball. He is a health nut and always tries to hand out healthy alternatives to candy on Halloween (raisins, prunes, trail mix, etc.), which are always rejected by trick-or- treaters. He also was the hero of the first Mud Bowl, according to Big Nate: Blasts Off. His first name was first stated on July 28, 2005. * Ellen Wright: Nate's fifteen-year-old sister. Unlike Nate, Ellen is responsible and hardworking and loves cats and figure-skating, and egg salad. Nate is always compared to Ellen in school by teachers. She is Nate's consistent rival, and he enjoys playing pranks on her. Ellen also dates Gordie on and off, who works at the comic book store, Klassic Komix and has previously dated Kenny Smithson, the captain of the football team and is considered her crush. They briefly broke up before reconciling. She is 4 years older than Nate. * Marjorie ‚ÄúMarge‚Äù Wright: Nate's grandmother. She and her husband, Vern, have a slightly tense relationship, as she sometimes nags him about giving up her career for married life and for generally being lazy and perverted. * Vernon ‚ÄúVern‚Äù Wright: Nate's grandfather. He enjoys stating his opinion without consideration, using his age to show off. He is shown to have a tattoo, and he also likes Junior Mints. * Theodore ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Wright: Nate's lazy uncle, an overweight, unemployed man-child who lives in Nate's grandparent's basement. He dropped out of college and since then has never held down a job. He is oblivious to his family's hints that he move out and find work, and spouts sci-fi and musical trivia at the drop of a hat. He is a big fan of World of Warcraft, My Little Pony and Star Trek.  Nate's Friends  * Francis Butthurst Pope: Nate's number #1 friend, Francis is very intelligent, and this upsets his friends from time to time. He has a gap between his teeth and lets people bully him often. Nate and Francis frequently make fun of each other, but he states that this is how they operate. He also likes to read ‚ÄòThe Book of Facts‚Äô which annoys Nate and Teddy. Nate and Francis often argue about cats vs dogs as Francis is a cat person, he also has a cat named Pickles. Contrary to Nate's feelings for them, Francis is friendly with both Mrs. Godfrey and Artur. Francis plays the electric guitar in Enslave the Mollusk and dates Sheila Stapleton. * Teddy ‚àö Ortiz : Nate's number \\"1A\\" best friend, Teddy is a comedic character who frequently cracks jokes and annoys Nate. Like Francis, Teddy likes Artur and is a member of Enslave the Mollusk. His middle name is the square root symbol since his parents are math teachers. In Big Nate: Flips Out, it is revealed that he is fluent in Spanish. He plays the musical keyboard in Enslave The Mollusk. In 1994, it is revealed that Teddy is half Mexican, and half Puerto Rican. In 1994, it is revealed that over the summer Teddy gets to live in Mexico with his grandparents, however, this stopped happening in 1996. Teddy also knows a lot about the Civil War, as his dad is an expert of the Civil War, and has been teaching him facts since he was a baby.  Secondary   Nate's Classmates  * Dee Dee Dorcas Holloway: A friend of Nate mentioned in Big Nate Strikes Again and also reappeared in Big Nate Goes for Broke and Big Nate Flips Out. She is a member of the drama club and is considered by Nate to be a drama queen. Nate does not like her much at first, but she gradually becomes a part of Nate's friend group and a major character. Dee Dee and Nate are now friends and are comfortable with each other. She is a very good artist and cartoonist, and once hosted a large party. * Chad Applewhite: Chad is one of Nate's good friends. He is a chubby kid with red hair and freckles. He is obsessed with eating and food. In Big Nate: In a Class By Himself; Nate mistakes him for Todd. He is willing to help Nate with all his schemes. When he is selling things with Nate, because he is so cute, the customers end up buying all the things he is selling. Chad has appeared in the comics since February 16, 2006. On September 30, 2019, Nate hypnotized Chad to be rude and obnoxious so Gina, who has a crush on Chad, would stop being his science lab partner. Chad did not revert to his nice self until October 12. * Artur Pashkov: A very friendly, intelligent, and well- liked exchange student from Belarus. He was first seen on May 7, 2001.Big Nate episode for May 7, 2001, He is in Nate's class and is Jenny Jenkins' boyfriend. Jenny's liking for Artur and Artur's ability to beat Nate at chess (and almost anything else) makes Nate take an instant dislike to Artur. Artur was the Boys' Age-Group Chess Champion of Belarus before moving to the United States. Artur speaks broken English as a second language. He is very innocent, gentle, kind, and (most of the time) unassuming. He regards Nate as his best friend and is generally unaware of Nate's dislike of him. He went with his father, a college professor, to Turkey for 6 months, during which time Nate tried to start going out with Jenny. Artur is a nice boy who is trying to please Nate, including letting Nate beat him at chess at one point. While Nate somewhat views Artur as a friend, he is quite jealous of Artur's talent and better luck. Artur has proven to be a match for Nate in chess, which is important because Nate is extremely good at chess. * Randy Betancourt: One of Nate's other rivals which Nate sometimes refers to as \\"Randy Buttancourt\\". Randy once got Nate into detention in the chess club bake sale by using Nate as a scapegoat. In Big Nate Strikes Again, he creates a fleece ball team called the Raptors and gets revenge on Nate by injuring him, stepping hard on his foot, after Nate accidentally breaks Randy's nose. Usually, Nate tries to avoid confrontation with Randy, but once when Randy was bullying Francis, Nate jumped on Randy \\"like a rabid wolverine.\\" They became kind of friends on a field trip after a Jefferson student shoved Nate in Big Nate Blasts Off. Their new friendship is strengthened when the two boys are in the PS 38 Ultimate Frisbee team in the Mud Bowl. Randy and Nate discover they are very effective at playing together. From rivals, they go on to become great friends. However, in the comic strip, they remain rivals. In one comic, it is revealed that his mom writes him a note in his lunch bag and calls him \\"Li'l Dumpling\\". Randy was caught stealing a My Little Pony book at Klassic Comix. Randy once got a dislocated shoulder, after Nate ducked when Randy attempted to tackle him. After that Randy was seen going into an ambulance. * Jenny Jenkins: Nate's classmate since 1st grade. She is his biggest crush, however, she used to despise Nate (though Nate was oblivious, believing Jenny is hiding her true feelings). On February 2, 2013, she briefly moved to Seattle, Washington. However, she moved back on June 4, 2013. She is blonde with blue eyes and dates Artur. She has no feelings for Nate and up to 2016, she couldn't stand Nate. But on April 11, 2016, it was stated that Nate doesn't like Jenny anymore, so Jenny doesn't hate him and they are friends now. She tends to go berserk when something embarrassing is done to her (e.g. when Nate trips and spills egg salad on her). In older comics, it is mentioned that she and Sheila Stapleton were best friends. In first grade Nate misunderstood Jenny‚Äôs name tag calling her Jonny. * Breckenridge Puffington III: Nate's most recent met student. He's somewhat shy and is a huge fanatic of plants. Teddy is constantly messing up his first name. He considered Nate his \\"buddy,\\" but Nate thinks the opposite about him. Nate said to his friends once that Breckenridge is a stiff, boring, has an annoying voice, and is a wuss. Nate was constantly wondering if he had met Breckenridge before. He was known to Nate as Bobby when he attended the Honey Hive for a month 7 years ago, and he used to bully Nate when they were toddlers. He was a contributing member of Nate's Non- Stoppers winning the scavenger hunt and even found the Granny Peppers Mural. He has only appeared once in 2015 and in a drawing in Big Nate Blasts Off. * Nick Blonsky: Nick is mentioned in the first two books. In the first, Nate says even Nick was raising his hand along with everyone else but he had a pencil up his nose. In the second, Nate says he is a horrible project partner because he is usually 'digging for gold'. He makes his first major appearance in the fifth book. He steals a camera that Nate borrowed from Mrs. Godfrey, which results in Francis getting in trouble. Nick says he stole the camera just because he wanted to see Nate and Francis fight. Dee Dee records the conversation and Nick gets suspended from school for a week. Nick is also a known liar. He has never appeared in a comic strip but was mentioned on October 16, 2014. * Gina Hemphill-Toms: One of Nate's schoolmates and rivals. Gina is an egotistical nerd. She weighs 123 pounds (56 kilograms) as a result of no exercise. Gina spends 18 hours a day studying and wears nerdy, thick glasses. Gina always gets an A-plus on her assignments, but sometimes she gets them because the teachers like her. She is an enemy of Nate and likes to get him in trouble. Gina almost never gets detention, except for three incidents: One time because Gina tried to correct an error of Nate's test to in an attempt to lower Nate's grade, in Big Nate Strikes Again for screaming in the library, and recently she got five detentions for belittling Nate by making him nice to her all week and forcing him to tie her shoe (Nate also got two detentions for accidentally hitting Mrs. Godfrey with Gina's shoe). Gina also has a case of chronic flatulence, according to Nate. * Kim Cressly: A very big girl who at one point decided Nate was her boyfriend and refused to take \\"no\\" for an answer. Nate spent much of his time trying to avoid her before she started dating Chester. When Nate's team was unable to find a sponsor, her family's bakery became the sponsor, giving the name the Cream Puffs, much to Nate's horror. She then joined and \\"dated\\" Nate, though he attempted to object many times. This was before she dated Chester, but she continued on the team anyway. * Chester Budrick: Chester Budrick is a male student at P.S. 38 and a school bully. Chester is mostly seen either in detention, bullying Nate, etc. He is also dating Kim Cressley, who previously had a crush on Nate. He is also shown to play on the school baseball and basketball team. Chester's appearance is unknown and has been teased throughout the series. In Big Nate Strikes Again, it was revealed he has a beard and tattoos and looks like he has been on growth hormones. He is 6 foot 6 inches and weighs 300 pounds (136 kilograms). * Marcus Goode: Marcus Goode is the \\"popular kid\\" of the seventh grade at P.S. 38, though it is difficult to understand why. He's a narcissist, and tends to be quite a bully, usually to sixth-grade students. He is often accompanied by his cronies, Andy and Dennis. In 2011, Nate joins his posse, but then realizes that it isn't that fun. After Marcus teases Artur, Nate reaches his breaking point and quits, earning a black eye when standing up to him when he used Francis' dumb technique of only saying \\"I'm not afraid of you.\\" He ran against Nate for student president once in 2009 and lost to Nate. Nate had also attempted to become a trendsetter like Marcus by spreading a fashion trend of wearing a sombrero throughout P.S. 38, which didn't end well for Nate, whose sombrero got its brim torn off and yanked down to his waist by Marcus. Marcus also appeared as the main antagonist of the sixth chapter book, Big Nate In the Zone. * Ruby Dinsmore: Nate‚Äôs current girlfriend in the eighth book, Big Nate: Blasts Off, It was shown that Randy Betancourt also had feelings for her, but when Nate says he was not moving to California for his dad‚Äôs new job, she kissed him on the cheek. She also played in the Mud Bowl. Randy was always trying to impress her.  Nate's Teachers at Public School 38  * Mrs. Clara Godfrey: Nate's ultimate hated teacher, his social studies teacher. Nate spends much of his time trying to avoid her outside of class and antagonizing her in class, making up several nicknames for her, like Venus de Silo, Godzilla, Dark Side Of the Moon, She who Must not Be Named, Dragon Breath, etc.. Nate has been known to exaggerate her physical features in his comics. Nate always refers here to the 'Creature Teacher' and hates her the most due to her rude attitude and the fact that she is a cat person. Additionally, he frequently draws her as a parody of The Devil. Nate also thinks that 6th grade would have been much easier for him if his older sister Ellen had not been there first. The relations between Mrs. Godfrey and Nate are not entirely negative, though. She allows Nate to create reports in cartoon form, giving him an outlet for his creativity and energy. She once saved Nate from choking on a peppermint. She has a daughter named Katrina. Her maiden name is Lessard then she changes it to Godfrey after she got married. She shares Nate's love for Star Trek: The Next Generation and maple donuts, something that is especially horrifying to him. She is a fan of Gina and favors her. * Mr. Ken Rosa: Nate's art teacher, Mr. Rosa is a soft-spoken and mild-mannered man but somewhat overworked and embittered about his career. As a result, Nate enjoys a lot of freedom in the art class. He also enjoys sketching pictures of his teachers. Mr. Rosa has a master's degree in art, but he has to work at an ice cream shop called Sweet Licks all summer long to make ends meet. On a January 1994 strip, it is revealed he is 40 years old. * Principal Wesley Nichols: The principal of P.S. 38. Nate and the other students are very friendly towards him, but do not treat him as an authority figure; he is bewildered by the students. On the rare occasion he goes out of his office, he soon retreats. He is sometimes snappy to Nate and Nate is taken aback by this, but of all the teachers (besides Mr. Rosa, Mrs. Shipulski, and Mrs. Czerwicki) he is probably the one Nate gets along best with; he sometimes helps the cartooning club and treats Nate's antics with good humor most of the time. He has a niece named Noelle, who is one of Nate's classmates and never gets in trouble. His first name was revealed when he was interviewed on the news in Big Nate Lives it Up. He is usually the victim in the worst prank on each Prank Day, so one year he got his wife‚Äôs cousin to pose as a police officer. * Mrs. Geraldine Shipulski: Principal Nichols' secretary. She prides herself on her 18.5 BMI. Nate flatters her by calling her a \\"cougar,\\" among other things. She has 22 million Twitter followers as shown in the recent comics in which one of them revealed her first name, Geraldine. It is mentioned that she is 62. Nate once gave her a box of Snowcaps on Secretary's Day. She has grey hair, but sometimes she can have yellow or brown hair. * Mrs. Lettie Czerwicki: She is a school volunteer who supervises the students in detention. She is friendly with Nate. She reads romance novels while sitting in detention. Mrs. Czerwicki sometimes plays table football with him. In one strip it is revealed that she wears a wig and was once an actress. * Mr. Shawn Galvin: Nate's science teacher. He has a crush on Greta Van Susteren. He has almost no visible sense of humor and conducts a very boring class. According to Nate, he is the Oldest Teacher present in school. * \\" School Picture Guy\\": Not only showing up every year as the school picture photographer, this character often shows up in unexpected places doing odd jobs such as a birthday clown, DJ or a school board meeting reporter. \\"School Picture Guy\\" often has some amusing nuggets of wisdom about the job he is doing, or for whatever is on Nate's mind at the moment. He is known to be a fan of Star Trek. His actual name has never been revealed, as he is constantly referred to by Nate and other characters as simply \\"School Picture Guy\\". He has also been seen by Nate at the local cinemas dressed as a cat, advertising for a seafood restaurant in a lobster costume, and at the annual fair as Loony the Balloon sculptor. * Coach Calhoun: Nate's main gym teacher. He is also Nate's friends' baseball, soccer, and basketball coach. He manages to keep a positive attitude despite the fact that P.S. 38's sports teams tend to lose competitions against other schools most of the time. * Coach John: A frequent substitute for Coach Calhoun, Coach John originally was the full time coach of the school's physical education program. He also is the school's soccer coach. He is known to use \\"tough love\\" speech tactics with his pupils and likes to make them do wind sprints, even when they are in a classroom. In July 2011, it is revealed that Coach John wears a toupee when Nate accidentally pulls it off. In Big Nate Flips Out, it shows Coach John's toupee blow off in the wind. He is bad with names (although he knows Nate's last name, Wright, well). He usually comes up with nicknames for Nate like \\"Porcupine,\\" \\"Speedy,\\" and \\"Cactus Head\\". * Mr. Staples: The math teacher. He has a tendency to tell corny knock-knock jokes, and to act corny in general as well. He was born in China. * Mrs. Clarke: Nate's English teacher, his second favourite teacher behind Mr. Rosa. It was mentioned that Mrs. Godfrey and Mrs. Clarke are very good friends. * Mrs. Hickson: The school librarian. She is a middle-aged woman who does not tolerate insolence from anyone. She is the first person to ever send Gina Hemphill-Toms to detention in Big Nate: Strikes Again. * Ms. LaChance: Nate's French teacher. Depicted in some of Nate's comic strips, with Nate stating she is one of his least favorite teachers. * Ms. Brindle: Nate's home economics teacher. She had once accidentally given herself food poisoning while teaching her class how to make crab rangoon. * Mr. Aldridge: Nate's computer lab teacher, who tends to make frequent mistakes when teaching computer code because his grades are not really good in general.

The word 'Zauq' (Good Taste) in the above article title is generally assumed to mean that only members with 'Good Taste in Urdu literature' will join the group. At least that's the hope of the current group members or the original group founders. Early members included Urdu language poets Noon Meem Rashid and Meeraji, brought to the meeting by his friend, Qayyum Nazar, an active member of the group. The Halqa is the second modern literary movement in Urdu poetry in the 20th century, founded just a couple of years after the leftist Progressive Writers' Movement and is considered to be the most influential group in modern poetry in the Urdu language. Web https://www.zauqepakistan.com Its first meeting was held under the name Bazm-e dƒÅstƒÅngo (Storytellers' gathering) and organized by writers looking for a non-political meeting, and the name was changed to 'Halqa-e Arbab-e Zauq' soon after. Unlike the Progressives, the Halqa was not politically driven, but reflected a traditional Western mode of modernist literature with new styles of prose and new subject areas outside of classical Urdu poetry, with some experimenting with themes relating to the personal experiences of the subjects of the British rule in India. Noon Meem Rashid, for example, while not politically engaged, was influenced by Western modernist poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound in exploring new verse forms. Urdu poet Meeraji, who introduced free verse and is considered to be the founder of symbolism in Urdu poetry, was also a prominent member of Halqa-e Arbab-e Zauq in its early days. Under his guidance, the Halqa moved from poetry reading events to become a group who also made active critiques on members' poetry. Although strongly influential on modernist Urdu poetry, the group included and welcomed members whose prose and poetry was more traditional, including writers of the ghazal. As time went by, left-wing progressives were also welcome as members both in India and Pakistan. These members included short story writer, Krishan Chander, playwright Rajinder Singh Bedi, and avowed Marxist and leading Urdu poet, Faiz Ahmad Faiz. Halqa continues to have regular sessions in various cities of Pakistan, most notably in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.http://halqa1.tripod.com/, Halqa-e Arbab-e Zauq, Islamabad branch, Retrieved 22 July 2016 It is credited to have produced many notable Urdu poets and writers.

In a career that lasted from September 1839 to September 1842 he ran eight times and won only one race. That race, however, was the 1840 Epsom Derby which he won as a 50/1 outsider. Little Wonder was one of the smallest Thoroughbreds to win a major race, standing less than 15 hands high. During his career, there were rumours that he was a \\"ringer\\", foaled in 1836 but the allegations were never substantiated. He was briefly retired after being injured in a race in 1842 and died of colic in 1843 while still in training. Background Little Wonder, a \\"beautifully brilliant bay\\" horse who stood 14.3¬Ω hands high was bred by Alexander Nowell at Underley Hall near Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmoreland where his sire Muley was based. Muley was a son of the Derby-winning mare Eleanor and won two races as a five-year-old at Newmarket in 1815. His early stud career was disappointing and he had been covering half-bred mares for some time before being bought by Nowell and relocated to Underley where he had considerable success. In addition to Little Wonder, he sired the Classic winners Margrave (St Leger) and Vespa (Epsom Oaks). Little Wonder was sent as a yearling to the Doncaster sales where he was bought for 45 guineas by David Robertson. He was sent into training with John Forth, who gave the colt his name, at Michelgrove near Angmering in Sussex. Racing career 1839: two- year-old season Little Wonder's racing career began at Newmarket in autumn. He finished unplaced behind Wardan in the Tuesday Two Year Old Plate at the Second October Meeting. In the Houghton meeting in late October he showed improved form when starting at odds of 4/1 and finishing second of the eight runners to Assassin in the Nursery Stakes. The result was creditable as he was carrying eight pounds more than the winner. Little Wonder's owner, David Robertson, who became Lord Marjoribanks in 1873. 1840: three-year-old season At Epsom on 3 June Little Wonder started at odds of 50/1 for the Derby, in which he was ridden by a little-known and inexperienced jockey named Macdonald. The weather was fine and sunny and the huge crowd included the Queen and Prince Albert. Launcelot, trained by John Scott and ridden by his brother Bill started favourite at 9/4. In the race, Macdonald settled Little Wonder in fifth or sixth place in the early stages before moving him up to third on the turn into the straight. Most of the runners were already struggling as the unnamed \\"Melody colt\\", Launcelot and Little Wonder pulled clear. While the two fancied colts struggled \\"very severely\\" for the lead, Macdonald was \\"quietly closing\\" on Little Wonder. Inside the final furlong, Macdonald produced the outsider with \\"one tremendous rush\\" along the inside rail to take the lead and win by a length from Launcelot with the Melody colt two lengths further back. Although the result was a huge upset, some commentators pointed out that a strict interpretation of his two-year-old form against Assassin should have led to him being regarded as a serious contender. George Tattersall, in \\"The Cracks of the Day\\" wrote that \\"whilst Launcelot and Melody were fighting for the bone, our little lurcher crept in quietly and carried it off\\". After the race, Macdonald received a gold-tipped riding-whip from Prince Albert as a testimonial. Robertson's prize money was ¬£3,775, while Forth reportedly took ¬£18,000 in winning bets. On his only other start of the year, Little Wonder ran on 17 June at Royal Ascot in the two and a half mile Ascot Stakes. Ridden by Nat Flatman, he started 4/6 favourite but finished second, beaten a length by the filly Darkness, to whom he was conceding twenty-four pounds. His defeat confirmed some commentators suspicions that the Derby had been a \\"falsely-run\\" race, and Little Wonder a lucky winner. 1842: five-year-old season After an absence of more than two years, Little Wonder reappeared at Goodwood on 29 July 1842. Carrying 126 pounds finished unplaced behind Retriever in the Chesterfield Cup. He was then sent to Doncaster for the inaugural running of the Great Yorkshire Handicap on 12 September. Carrying topweight of 126 pounds he ran a \\"capital\\" race to finish third to Galanthus and Disclosure, despite being injured and \\"much over- weighted\\". Whatever injuries Little Wonder sustained cannot have been serious as was sent to race at Kelso in Scotland nine days later. He finished last of the three runners behind Cabrera and Charles the Twelfth in the Roxburgh Gold Cup and then broke down injured again when finishing third in the Border Club Racing Stakes later that afternoon. 1843: six-year-old season Little Wonder's owner, J. Walbran, forfeited the Great St. Wilfred Handicap Stakes in August 1843 at the Ripon Meeting. Little Wonder died at Middleton in the fall of 1843 of inflammation of the bowels. His brother, \\"The Little Known\\" did stand as a stallion and sired some horses, though none of any consequence, between 1846 and 1860. At least two pubs, one in Harrogate and one in Northfleet were named in Little Wonder's honour. Age and identity There were doubts about Little Wonder's age and identity. When Sir John Astley, a racehorse owner and Steward of the Jockey Club heard that Forth had described Little Wonder as an early foal, he observed that the trainer was correct \\"for there is little doubt that he was foaled a year earlier than his competitors were.\\" Some modern sources have treated the rumour as a fact, but no official enquiry was made and no objection was ever lodged. By contrast, the victory of the \\"ringer\\" Running Rein in the 1844 Derby provoked an immediate objection and a subsequent court case. In 1841 a five-year-old horse owned by Robertson ran at the Kelso October meeting under the name \\"The Little Known, brother to Little Wonder\\". He finished second in the Roxburgh Gold Cup, and was unplaced in the first two heats of the Stand Plate later that afternoon. These races took place during the unexplained two-year hiatus in Little Wonder's racing career. Pedigree *Little Wonder was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Highflyer, meaning that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Bob Crosby was born on February 27, 1897, in Midland, Texas. Crosby was raised around Kenna, New Mexico. He became an experienced cowhand there. His first time as a rodeo contestant was in 1923. He entered a rodeo competition at New York's Yankee Stadium. At 13, he won his first rodeo title. Will Rogers encouraged him to enter larger rodeos. Usually he entered all events, but then just the timed ones. He won the Roosevelt Trophy the first time in 1925 by competing in two rodeos and winning the all-around events at them. These are Cheyenne Frontier Days and the Pendleton Round-Up. He again won in 1927-1928. Winning three times establishes \\"permanent possession of the trophy\\". Fans began to know him as \\"Wild Horse Bob\\". Crosby's featured events were roping. At Madison Square Garden, he won the calf roping title three times. At Pendleton, he won the steer roping title four times. At Cheyenne, he won the steer roping title twice. Around the 1930s and 1940s he participated in some matched steer roping events. They took place against Carl Arnold and the Weir brothers. He also owned his own ranch. The Cross B Ranch was located near Roswell, New Mexico. Crosby wore an old black hat that represented good luck, which fans came to recognize and use as a cue to cheer. He remarked, \\"Someday, to their surprise, I'm going to wear my Sunday hat and see if it's the old black felt or the man they're always cheering\\". Bob Crosby died on October 20, 1947, in Roswell, New Mexico. He had an accident in a Jeep near his ranch. Crosby was declared the \\"King of the Cowboys\\" by Life magazine.

Its purpose was to intercept the Nez Perce in their flight from north central Idaho over Lolo Pass into the Bitterroot Valley of western Montana. The name describes the effectiveness of the fort. Background In the Nez Perce War of 1877, the U.S. Army defeated, but did not demoralize, the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph at the Battle of the Clearwater, July 11‚Äì12. Pursued by General O. O. Howard the Nez Perce, numbering about 200 warriors and 750 persons in total along with more than 2,000 horses, decided to flee across Lolo Pass into the Bitterroot Valley and onward to the Great Plains. The Nez Perce were familiar with this region, having been frequent visitors while en route to the plains to hunt buffalo. Their leader Looking Glass persuaded the other Nez Perce leaders that they would be safe from the U.S. Army in Montana and that he could lead them to a safe refuge among his friends, the Crow Indians. The Nez Perce route across Lolo Pass to Fort Fizzle and beyond The Army and the Nez Perce A reconstruction of part of Fort Fizzle at Fort Fizzle Historic Site in Montana. White settlers and U.S. Army soldiers in the Bitterroot Valley, informed by telegraph that the Nez Perce were coming their way, prepared to defend themselves. Captain Charles Rawn had only 35 soldiers to defend the valley. On July 23, two white youths who had been prisoners of the Nez Perce reported to Rawn that the Nez Perce were camped at Lolo Hot Springs, on the Montana side of the pass and only a few miles from the white settlements in the Bitterroot Valley. The youths had been released to bring a message from the Nez Perce that they wished to pass peacefully through the settlements. Rawn, however, was ordered to \\"compel the Indians to surrender their arms and ammunition, and to dispute their passage, by force of arms, into Bitterroot Valley.\\" On July 25, Rawn, his 35 soldiers and 50 civilian volunteers constructed a wooden barricade of logs and earth two or below where the Nez Perce were camped and about west of Lolo, Montana. On July 26, Rawn met with Looking Glass who requested to traverse the Bitterroot Valley without violence. Rawn demanded that the Nez Perce surrender their arms and ammunition and the meeting terminated without any decision. The next day, 216 armed men, including 15 to 20 Flathead Indian scouts were gathered at the improvised fort and the Governor of Montana, Benjamin F. Potts, had arrived. Rawn and Looking Glass met again and each repeated their demands. When Rawn returned to the fort and said that he anticipated a battle with the Nez Perce, most of the volunteers left, declaring that \\"no act of hostility on their part should provoke the Indians.\\" The next morning, July 27, less than 100 men were left to man the fort and oppose the Nez Perce. Governor Potts had also found reason to depart. According to Chief Joseph, Captain Rawn agreed to allow the Nez Perce to pass through Bitterroot Valley in peace. Rawn never admitted making such an agreement. The barricade where Rawn and his men were entrenched was in a constricted wide passage in the Lolo Creek canyon, enclosed on both sides by precipitous ridges where \\"a goat could not pass.\\" Nevertheless, on July 28 the Nez Perce ‚Äì men, women, children, and livestock‚Äîclimbed the ridges to the north and bypassed the barricade, leaving the defenders in their rear. Rawn and his soldiers exchanged a few shots with the Nez Perce on the ridge and then abandoned the fort and followed them down into the Bitterroot Valley at a safe distance. An advance party of soldiers bumped into the rear guard of the Nez Perce. Looking Glass exchanged friendly greetings with them. Fifty of the civilian volunteers stumbled into the Nez Perce camp and were captured, but were released after Looking Glass promised no violence against anybody.Josephy, p. 573 The soldiers retired to Missoula, the civilian volunteers disbanded, and the Nez Perce continued on their way south through the Bitterroot Valley, buying fresh horses, food, and supplies from local ranchers and farmers.Brown, p. 233Hampton, p. 142 Thus, the makeshift fort acquired its name -- \\"Fort Fizzle.\\"Josephy, p. 572 The aftermath The Fort Fizzle fiasco prompted volleys of charges and counter-charges of cowardice and ineptitude between and among the government and citizens of Montana and the U.S. government and its army. A volunteer explained that \\"we were not silly enough to uselessly incite the Indians to devastate our valley.\\" Many Montanans, including the governor and fire-breathing journalists, began to comment favorably on the \\"bravery\\" and \\"audacity\\" of the Nez Perce and the wisdom of the citizens in avoiding an armed encounter.Brown, p. 226Hampton, pp. 144-145 However, the respite from war of the Nez Perce was brief. Lulled into complacency by their peaceful passage through the Bitterroot Valley, they would be attacked on August 9 by Colonel John Gibbon and 200 men in the bloody Battle of the Big Hole. A portion of the fort has been reconstructed at Fort Fizzle Historic Site, adjacent to U.S. Route 12. The site parallels the historic Lolo trail once used by the Nez Perce, Salish, and Kootenai tribes and Lewis and Clark. Lewis and Clark's westbound expedition ascended Lolo Creek in mid-September 1805, and they revisited the area on their way back east in late June 1806.

He received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1968 for his contribution to children's literature. He is best known for his novel Marcelino Bread and Wine (1953) which was filmed in 1955, as Miracle of Marcelino.See page 186 of World Literature in Spanish: An Encyclopedia by Maureen Ihrie, Salvador Oropesa, 3 volumes, 1294 ages, . On line Early life Sanchez-Silva was born in Madrid. His father, also Jos√© Mar√≠a S√°nchez Silva, was a journalist close to anarchism, writing in the journal Earth, who went into exile in 1939. The family had been unstructured and the son (S√°nchez-Silva) at times was practically a vagrant child. He joined institutions for orphans and children at risk such as the Brown School of Madrid (Madrid City Hall dependent). In these institutions he learned typing and shorthand, which earned him a stenographer's position in Madrid.  Career  In 1934, he published his first book The Man in the Scarf. During the Spanish Civil War, he remained in the Republican zone in Madrid, working with the Falange until Nationalist troops entered the city. In 1939, he began working as a journalist in the newspaper Arriba. He became assistant principal of the paper and collaborated with the newspaper El Pueblo. Sanchez-Silva won fame as a result of Marcelino Bread and Wine (Marcelino, pan y vino, 1953), which was made into a film by Ladislao Vajda as Miracle of Marcelino, and became one of the great successes of Spanish cinema worldwide. It was further adapted into Marcelino (anime). After the success of Marcelino, he returned to the character in stories Marcelino Pan y Vino and Adventures in the sky Marcelino Pan y Vino. Together with Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia, he was the author of the screenplay of the movie Franco, ese hombre, a biography in the caudillo. Awards The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Sanchez-Silva received the writing award in 1966. He won the Spanish prize for literature in 1957.

History The school was opened in 1870 by Henrietta \\"Etta\\" Aiken Kelly (March 17, 1844 ‚Äì January 18, 1916)Henrietta Kelly was well born to a prominent Charleston family, with a \\"silver spoon in her mouth\\". Henrietta Aiken's christening set is silver with gilt and \\"finely engraved with the Aiken crest\\" probably engraved in a northern city. It originated with Heloise boudo (d. 1837), who was a Charleston silver dealer specializing in spoons. Cup and spoon, c. 1827‚Äì1837. Charleston, S.C. Her parents were William Kelly (1799‚Äì1882) and Mary Stoll Kelly (1811‚Äì1867). She is buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. Henrietta Aikin Kelly at Find a Grave. initially in her own home. Kelly, who was an expert on silk worms, had earlier sought to have female students admitted to study at the College of Charleston. After that effort proved unsuccessful, she established the Charleston Female Seminary to offer females access to higher education. Beginning in 1872, the school was housed on 50 Philip Street, in a building constructed in 1871 by architect John Henry Devereux. Devereux used \\"mixed Roman\\" Italianate architecture, and \\"an arcaded and pedimented facade\\". Kelly ran the school using the motto Mens sana in corpore sano and incorporated physical education into the curriculum. In the 1890s, the school occupied the Benjamin Lazarus House on 151 Wentworth Street, at which time a third floor was added to the building. \\"From 1882 to 1896, the building housed Miss Kelly and boarders of her 'rigorous but genteel' academy\\". Thereafter, it was at a location that became the Nathaniel Russell House at 51 Meeting Street. Historical context The establishment of Female seminaries was a cultural trend across the United States. They were associated with a large and growing trend toward women's equality. Beginning round 1815 and close to the Civil War, it has been said to be at the confluence of various liberation movements. Southern iterations were \\"among the most advanced in the country\\" offering the equivalent of four-year college programs even before the American Civil War. It was part of \\"an unprecedented social experiment in women's education.\\" Southern female seminaries educated daughters and \\"education in a renowned and fashionable seminary conferred social capital as well as intellectual and artistic satisfaction\\". The continuing changes at Charleston Female Seminary aligned with trends throughout the United States. They included ever growing facilities in a more institutional format. Classical building structures became a norm, and were in sharp contrast to earlier forms of female education which moved from boarding schools and private education to seminaries. By midcentury, \\"female seminaries and academies were everywhere, replacing the homelike atmosphere of boarding schools with a more institutional setting\\". These larger buildings housed \\"dormitory rooms, chapels, dining halls, and classrooms\\". The timing of the opening of a female seminary in 1870 was significant, as there was a retrenchment in female education following the Civil War. Another Charleston female seminary was Miss Murden's Seminary for Young Ladies. Distinguished alumnae A notable alumna was author Beatrice Witte Ravenel (August 24, 1870 ‚Äì March 15, 1956), mother of the South Carolina architectural historiographer Beatrice St. Julien Ravenel (October 3, 1904 ‚Äì December 2, 1990). Another was Hermine Kean Bulwinkle (1868‚Äì1942), who married Solomon Anderson Wolff (1861‚Äì1954) in 1890. Both were on the faculty Gaston College, Dallas, N.C. A third notable alumna was Sarah Campbell Allan (1861‚Äì1954), who went on to become a physician in spite of educational and professional barriers she encountered as a woman. After completing a medical preparatory course at the South Carolina College for Women in Columbia and studying medicine at the Women's Medical College of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, in 1894 she was licensed as a physician by the state of South Carolina. She was the only woman in the pool of applicants examined by the South Carolina Medical Board that year, the first time the board sat to examine applicants, and she received the board's highest grade. As a doctor, for 11 years Allan worked with female patients at the South Carolina Hospital for the Insane in Columbia and taught anatomy and physiology to nursing students. Sarah Visanska graduated from the Charleston Female Seminary in 1889. She was president of the South Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs from 1910-1912.John William Leonard, Women's Who's Who of America (American Commonwealth Company 1914): 840.

The term is particularly used by Martin Maiden following Mark Aronoff's identification of morphomic functions and the morphomic level‚Äîa level of linguistic structure intermediate between and independent of phonology and syntax. In distinguishing this additional level, Aronoff makes the empirical claim that all mappings from the morphosyntactic level to the level of phonological realisation pass through the intermediate morphomic level.  Typology of morphomic patterns  Functions defined at the morphomic level are of many qualitatively different types. One example is the different ways the perfect participle can be realised in English‚Äì‚Äìsometimes, this form is created through suffixation, as in bitten and packed, sometimes through a process of ablaut, as in sung, and sometimes through a combination of these, such as broken, which uses ablaut as well as the suffix -n. Another is the division of lexemes into distinct inflectional classes. Inflectional classes present distinct morphological forms, but these distinctions bear no meaning beyond signalling inflectional patterns; they are internal to morphology, and thus morphomic.Martin Maiden's theory of morphomes has been mostly developed with regard to the Romance languages, where he identified many examples of morphomic stem distributions. A different typology of morphomic patterns has been put forth by Erich Round. He distinguishes rhizomorphomes, which are a property of roots (corresponding to the traditional notion of inflectional class), metamorphomes, which are a property of paradigms, a set of cells which behave in a particular way (corresponding to the morphome in Maiden's terms, such as patterns of stem distribution), and meromorphomes, which are a property of exponents, and have only been identified for now in Kayardild and related languages.

Invented in 1870, full-scale production started around 1897 and continued into the early 1900s. Polyphons were exported all over world and music was supplied for the English, French and German markets, as well as further afield, with music cataloged for the Russian, Polish and Balkan regions. Polyphon is also a record label as registered by German Polyphon Musikwerke AG in 1908.

Polyphon-Musikwerke AG acquired 24 April 1917 the record plant Deutsche Grammophon-Aktiengesellschaft from the German government. The German state was taken over DG and British holdings as enemies property during World War I. The factories Deutsche Grammophon and Polyphon- Musikwerke were handled by Polyphonwerke AG and headquarter was relocated in Berlin. The company was called Polyphon-Grammophon-Konzern. In 1918 Polyphon AG established their head offices in Markgrafenstra√üe 76 in Berlin. Bruno Borchard became director general. The early owner Joseph Berliner remained as member of the boards until his retirement in 1921. In 1919 the Austrian subsidiary Polyphon-Sprechmaschinen und Schallplatten GmbH was founded in Vienna. It was as renamed Polyphon Schallplatten Ges. mbH. The Danish Nordisk Polyphon A. S. was founded in Kopenhagen. In Stockholm the Swedish subsidiary was called Nordisk Polyphon A. B. The ownership of foreign activities were concentrated in March 1929 into a Swiss holding company the Polyphon-Holding AG. In 1932 this holding was renamed to Polydor Holding AG. The owner Polyphon Werke AG was merged with Deutsche Grammophon AG in 1932. Soon was the total shutdown of the production in Leipzig. In 1933 DG sold their shares of Polydor Holding. In 1937 DG was renamed to Deutsche Grammophon GmbH. A capital merger operation took place by a consortium of Deutsche Bank and Telefunken Gesellschaft. In 1932 founded Telefunken Platte GmbH got a production plant as it was needed. DGG was sold to the German Siemens & Halske AG electronics company in 1941. In 1954 DGG established a subsidiary in London, Polydor Records Ltd. In 2000 the French mediacompany Vivendi SA acquired the current owner Universal Music Group from Seagram. Polyphon music box Original examples still exist of 1870-invented Polyphon and contemporary manufacturers produce small quantities of both the devices and discs. A Polyphon is a large disk-operated music box. The plectra protrude from the backside of the disk. As the disk rotates they contact a ratchet mechanism that plucks the tines. A large sounding board amplifies the sound. Many interchangeable disks were be available for producing favorite melodies. Making music The tune is punched out on the disc with pitch determined by the position of the punching. In the manufacturing process, the punched metal was curled back onto the underside of the disc, creating a raised projection that resembles a letter P when viewed obliquely. When the Polyphon operates, the resulting disc projections, called plectra, engage with a series of ratchet-like star wheels, each with 9 projections, that sit in a gantry. Each star wheel, when moved through 40 degrees on its axis, plucks a tooth on the instrument's comb. The tooth resonates, sounding a predetermined note. Upon the musical comb, the fast treble notes are sounded furthest from the centre and the slower base notes nearest the centre. Many comb variants were manufactured, including a single comb on smaller instruments, and duplex combs (simultaneous strike) on mid-sized examples of 11-inch-diameter and 15.5-inch-diameter instruments. Most larger twin-combed examples had alternate strike although other manufacturers, notably Symphonion, produced large size instruments with duplex combs. Motor Almost without exception, all Polyphons are powered by a hand-wound clockwork motor. Polyphon may have devised an electric motor variant of a large coin-operated model in the latter days of production, but to date, no known original examples exist. The motor has an output drive dog, which is a circular component with round-topped dowels arrange to fit the holes in the discs. Discs of small diameter have two centrally located holes (centre drive), while larger discs had a series of holes around the periphery (peripheral drive). During operation, a disc is placed on the centre post, or centre boss, a pressure bar goes over the disc to hold it in place and the drive dog revolves the disc. The playing time for each disc varies, dependent upon the diameter. For example, the running time of a 19.5/8 inch-diameter disc (50cm) is about 1 minute and 50 seconds. Modern availability Numerous sizes of Polyphons and associated discs were produced, with the diameters ranging from 6 inches to 24.5 inches. It is possible to purchase new discs, currently manufactured in the UK by Renaissance Disc‚Äôs, for every size of Polyphon originally produced. Originals have survived in relatively large numbers, and are often available on internet sales sites. Polyphon Musik Polyphon disc records and machines followed in Germany 1905 and in England in June 1908. The trade mark was registered in Britain in 1900. Earlier Polyphon overstamped their place of origin. Polyphon as a label was founded in Leipzig on 8 September 1908 (registered Nr. 110347). In England their Klingsor Records label were repressed under Polyphon around 1910. In June 1913 the label was changed to Pilot. Polydor label was founded 2 April 1913 in Leipzig and registered on 25 July 1914 (Nr. 316613). For example, Polyphon Musikwerke entered into Persian market in 1927. In 1927 Polyphon Musikwerke recorded 200 matrices in Iraq followed by making 600 recordings in Tehran. Their agent the Hakkak company opened shops in Baghdad, Tehran and Kermanshah. Polyphon Musik and Polyphon Record had unique issue series in 36 countries or areas within decades. In 1931 agreement with Polyphon gave for Decca exclusive British licence to records on this label. Since 1946 Polydor has been the popular music arm, while the new Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft label was going to be a classical music label in 1949.Emil berliner Studios - The History Of The Record 1926-1950 The previous used label Grammophon was disbanded.

There are several reefs located in the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary as well as mangroves and beaches including James Bond Beach. The Golden Clouds reef is one of the largest in Oracabessa Bay and is a popular dive destination due to its diverse reef structure, vibrant marine life and close proximity to the Cayman Trough. Sea Turtle in Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary Oracabessa has a long history as a Jamaican fishing village, with Oracabessa Bay at the heart of this activity. Oracabessa Bay comprises a rich ecosystem, home to a variety of habitats including coral reefs and mangroves with plentiful estuarine areas providing nursery habitat for a wide range of marine life. Concerned for the bay's long-term health, a local group called the Oracabessa Foundation succeeded in getting the bay declared an officially protected fish sanctuary.Seacology article The northern boundary of the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary is located on the edge of the Cayman Trough with walls that begin at 60 ft. and drop down to over 150 ft. These walls are covered in a large variety of hard and soft corals. Beautiful elephant-ear, basket, tube, and rope sponge are found on the edge of this trench with shades of red, pink, yellow, and orange colors as well as enormous trees of black coral and gorgonia. The walls contain many overhangs and ledges and are home to lobsters, king crab, green and spotted moray eels, and a host of other marine creatures. Beyond the boundaries of the Fish Sanctuary, the Cayman Trough plunges to depths of over 25,000 ft and is renowned for deep-water sport fishing including marlin and tuna.Deepwater Fishing In 2010, the Fish Sanctuary launched the Oracabessa Bay Sea Turtle Project, which monitors and protects critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles on the Oracabessa Bay beach and in the area. Due to the success of the project, over 100 nests and 16,000 hatchlings are now recorded each year. Visitors to ‚ÄúTurtle‚Äù beach can witness a nest release, where turtles are unleashed from the nest at a time which maximizes the percentage of eggs that hatch and reach the sea. When one of the Fish Sanctuary wardens carefully releases the nest, visitors witness the hatchlings dash for the sea and the number of turtles surviving is greatly increased with predators such as birds and crabs prevented from attacking the hatchlings.Oracabessa Bay Sea Turtle project Staghorn Coral Cultivation In 2012, the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary launched its Coral Propagation Project through the support of the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Program. The intent of this project is to propagate 2,000 individual pieces of Staghorn coral and out-plant them within the Bay's reefs through coral gardening. The process known as coral gardening consists of collecting coral biomass, usually by breaking off fragments, growing fragments in a nursery, and out-planting the reared corals on reefs.Coral Gardening The Coral Propagation Project is intended to not only restore the thicket of Staghorn coral to its historical state on the reefs, which increases the health of the reef and provides needed habitat for fish, it is also retraining former local fishermen as coral gardeners, and providing gainful skills and steady employment opportunities for them.Coral propagation Grant Awarded References External links *Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary Website *Aerial view *Oracabessa Website *Oracabessa Foundation Website Category:Geography of Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica Category:Tourist attractions in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica Category:Protected areas of Jamaica * ","title":"Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary"},{"id":"34404331","text":"Acacia cremiflora, is a small wattle plant occurring in parts of inland New South Wales.

Description The shrub usually has a bushy habit and grows to a height of less that but can reach as high as . It is often composed of five to six main branches diverging at the base of the plant. The branches are erect or arched and split into ribbed, brown to green, smooth, hairy branchlets. The dark grey-green to green coloured phyllodes are flat or convex with an elliptic to broadly elliptic or slightly orbicular shape. the phyllodes usually have a length of and a width of with an undulate margin and acute apex. When it blooms it produces inflorescences with spherical flower- heads that have a diameter of and contain 18 to 26 pale yellow to cream- coloured flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering are a dull brown to dark brown colour and have an oblong to broadly oblong shape and are straight or sometimes curved with a length of and a width of and are thickly coriaceous. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Barry John Conn and Terrence Michael Tame in 1996 as part of the work A revision of the Acacia uncinata group (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) as published in the journal Australian Systematic Botany. It was reclassified as Racosperma cremiflorum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.

Its development began in March 2006 by Antimatter15, then a sixth grader. Ajax Animator was originally intended to be a free replacement to Flash MX, but is now a general-purpose animation tool. Contrary to its name, it uses little to no Ajax in its code. Ajax Animator is primarily written using JavaScript, the Ext JS framework, and HTML5-related technologies such as SVG. The software can be used either from within a web browser or from an offline installation.  History  Ajax Animator began as an ambitious project by Antimatter15, then a 6th grader. Its intended use was to draw stick figures and animation and export them to Flash files, as an alternative to the expensive Flash MX desktop program. It was first inspired by the Koolmoves Flash editing software. Development started around March 2006, based on the RichDraw JavaScript library, which allowed for in-browser graphics creation. The application was soon rewritten to use the DHTML Suite library from DHTML Goodies, and finally allowed for exporting SWF files through the Freemovie Java library. Development subsequently moved to Subversion on Google Code to ease production. Version 1.0 was rewritten to use version 1.0 of Sencha's Ext JS library instead. It also added support for inbetweening and sharing projects. The next version, 0.20, was a complete rewrite to support version 2.0 of Ext JS, and used the OnlyPaths library by josep_ssv, which extended RichDraw and was designed specifically for Ajax Animator. Later versions used the author's own VectorEditor library, based on the Rapha√´l framework.

Some of his works were used to accompany radio and television broadcasts. Rusling graphic notation from Notations by John Cage  Introduction to electronic composition  Terry Rusling worked as an engineer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). He was on-air engineer for the Gilmour's Albums hosted by CBC broadcaster Clyde Gilmour. In the early 1960s, Morris Surdin, a composer working at the CBC, suggested to Rusling that he try out the electronic studio at University of Toronto, Faculty of Music (UTEMS).\\"The Electronic Music Studio of the University of Toronto\\" by Myron Schaeffer, Journal of Music Theory, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring, 1963), pp. 73-81 Through Surdin, Rusling was introduced to Dr. Myron Schaeffer, to whom he submitted his first electronic compositions. Schaeffer invited Rusling to attend the graduate seminar at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Music, using the renowned electronic music studio (UTEMS) which included instruments designed by Hugh LeCaine such as the Special Purpose Tape Recorder. Rusling was awarded the title of Research Associate at the University of Toronto Faculty of Music. Among the notable composers who studied at University of Toronto's Electronic Music Studio (UTEMS) University of Toronto, Faculty of Music were John Mills-Cockell, Pauline Oliveros, Ann Southam, Gustav Ciamaga, John Beckwith, among others. During this period he was also known to be the recipient of a Canada Council Grant in support of his travel, education and production of electronic music.Canada Council 1964-65: Eighth Annual Report, p. 62 After receiving the grant he travelled to studios in the USA and Europe. He continued his studies and composed music in studios at the Psycho Acoustic Institute at Ghent University, Belgium; the University of Utrecht; and the University of Illinois.University of Illinois @ Urbana Electronic Music Studio Archive: List_of_All_Items_Found_in_EMS_Archive: http://hdl.handle.net/2142/100315 He also did work at the University of Rochester with Wayne Barlow as well as in Paris where he studied with Pierre Schaeffer. He spent two months at the Phillips lab in Holland learning about their new electronic equipment. All of Terry's music was precisely notated using mathematics and other symbols. His music was often inspired by his interest in visual art. During this period Terry also reported on an interview on CBC Radio that he worked at the BBC Radiophonic.

One of his public performances of electronic music was at the Bohemian Embassy in Yorkville, Toronto. October 1964. He also collaborated with visual artist Zbigniew Blazeje in a large multimedia exhibition in 1967 called Audio Kinetic Environment which began at the Art Gallery of Ontario and travelled to other galleries in Canada. The exhibit initially opened with music prepared by Blazeje. In an interview with Terry Rusling on CBC Radio, Rusling said that Blazeje approached him as he found the music he made was not good enough. Rusling stated he spent some time watching the kinetic installation and then proceeded to create a new score for the exhibition in Toronto and this music was used throughout the exhibit's tour of Canada. The installation toured to other galleries including the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The music was set to trigger lights in the installation. There was also a radio program combining Rusling's music with Earle Birney's sound poetry on CBC Radio. After the piece was performed they discussed their personal approaches to their art forms. Birney discussed various approaches he took including sound poetry and using chance techniques, such as cutting phrases from newspapers including comics into bits of paper and finding combinations by chance. A related collaboration with poet Gwendolyn MacEwen, combining poetry with electronic music was also broadcast on CBC Radio. Rusling also worked with performance artist and sound poet Bob Cobbing and dancer Rima Brodie.The piece Rusling made with Bob Cobbing was broadcast on CBC during the same show where Birney and Rusling also collaborated.

Differently from the traditional barter dynamics, ‚ÄúIn Kind Exchange‚Äù consists in an exchange in which the two parties (the user and the artists) do not discuss the value of the exchanged objects. In fact the project expects mutual appreciation and respect. The artist does not guarantee realistic portrait of the model and the choice of the present is at user's discretion.Russian Club Shanghai, –ù–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –æ–±–º–µ–Ω, 20.07.2011 There is a ‚Äúwhish list‚Äù redacted by Claudia Beccato and Sergey Balovin that helps people choosing among the artists needs.Something to present, Sergey Balovin website The economic value of the gift does not alter the size and the quality of the art work.  Origins and development of the project  The idea of the ‚ÄúIn Kind Exchange‚Äù project came to Sergey Balovin in Shanghai in 2011, when he moved to a new and empty apartment. He started to swap his drawings in exchange for furniture and household appliances with a neighbour about to move out. Soon the artist systematized the process of exchange, publishing on social media invitations to take part in the project. The participants met the artist e chose one of the two or three ink sketches made, offering in exchange whatever they believe could be useful to the artist apartment.PAINTING PORTRAITS TO SUSTAIN A LIFESTYLE WITH NO MONEY, Visual News, 25.03.2013 In few months the artist was able to furnish his apartment with the presents got by barter. He got everything, from dishes to furniture and household appliances. Therefore, the artist realised the possibility to live with the only exchange system and started to organize performances focused on different needs: from food to clothes (title of some performances: ‚Äúfeed the artist‚Äù, ‚Äúdress up the artist‚Äù, ‚Äúget the artist drunk‚Äù).

The word comes from ingle, meaning \\"fireplace\\" in Old English (from Old Scots or Irish aingeal, \\"angel\\" or euphemistically \\"fire\\"), and nook. History The inglenook originated as a partially enclosed hearth area, appended to a larger room. The hearth was used for cooking, and its enclosing alcove became a natural place for people seeking warmth to gather. With changes in building design, kitchens became separate rooms, while inglenooks were retained in the living space as intimate warming places, subsidiary spaces within larger rooms. Inglenooks were prominent features of shingle style architecture and characteristic of Arts and Crafts architecture but began to disappear with the advent of central heating. Prominent American architects who employed the feature included Greene and Greene, Henry Hobson Richardson, and Frank Lloyd Wright. British architect Richard Norman Shaw significantly influenced Richardson. In popular culture Inglenooks play a large role in Lucy M. Boston's first two Green Knowe novels. In John Stedelman's eponymous 1986 BBC One television adaptation of the first novel, The Children of Green Knowe (1954), Granny has her visitor Toseland (whom she calls \\"Tolly\\") \\"build up a blaze\\" each evening, before telling him a story. In episode 3, the ghost of Tolly's ancestral namesake (nicknamed \\"Toby\\") tells Tolly he and (the ghost of) his brother Alexander had joined Granny and Tolly during storytime the previous night, explaining: \\"I was in the inglenook; Alexander was in your chair\\". In the second novel, The Chimneys of Green Knowe (1958), and its film adaptation by Julian Fellowes, From Time to Time (2009), the chimneys themselves play important roles. Perhaps the most famous reference to an inglenook in literature occurs in the final line of John Betjeman's short poem 'In a Bath Teashop', where it has been immortalised as the setting for a tryst.

It was first published in 1955 in Galaxy magazine. It has often been anthologized, most notably in The Golden Age of Science Fiction, edited by Kingsley Amis (1981). Plot Guy and Mary Burckhardt wake up in their house in Tylerton on June 15, having both had terrible nightmares, but they cannot recall the events of their dreams. Guy dismisses the dream and goes to work as usual, the downtown offices of Contro Chemicals, which operates a highly automated and robot-staffed petrochemicals plant. But something is not right; he is surrounded everywhere by loud and all-pervasive advertising jingles for everything from cigarettes to freezers. A colleague named Swanson tries to speak to him but apparently does not get the desired reaction from Burckhardt and leaves. Burckhardt goes home, but the next morning, he realizes he has had the same nightmare and the date is still June 15. He knows what will happen when he gets to the office and that Swanson will again try to speak to him. This in fact happens. That evening, Burckhardt discovers that his cellar has seemingly been dismantled and \\"rebuilt\\", in a way he does not recognize. The next morning is June 15 again. He mentions this when Swanson again tries to speak to him. Swanson hustles him away to the empty halls of the chemical plant. Hiding in a room at the end of a long tunnel, he explains his theory that they have all been tampered with and that an invader has taken over the town for unknown reasons. Neither of them is correct. In actuality, the chemical plant had exploded, and all the inhabitants of Tylerton were killed by the explosion or the chemical fumes. A ruthless advertising executive, Dorchin, took over the ruins and rebuilt them in miniature. The people were rebuilt as minuscule robots and are being used as captive subjects for testing high pressure advertising campaigns. TV and film versions Over the years, the story has been adapted for other media several times, including: * Two radio adaptations of \\"Tunnel Under the World\\" were broadcast as episodes of X Minus One. * It was produced by the BBC as a 1966 series 2 episode of the anthology series Out of the Unknown. * The story was the basis for the Italian surrealist film, Il tunnel sotto il mondo (1969). * The story inspired the French student short film, \\"Le 15 Mai\\" (1969), the directorial debut of Claire Denis. * An Australian TV movie, \\"Virtual Nightmare\\" (2000).

Background Sangam period The name 'Ko Veta' is engraved in Brahmi script on a seal buried with the skeleton and is assigned by the excavators to the 3rd century BCE. Ko, meaning \\"King\\" in Tamil, is comparable to such names as Ko Atan, Ko Putivira and Ko Ra-pumaan occurring in contemporary Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of ancient South India and Egypt.Indrapala, K. The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, pp. 324 Potsherds with early Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE have been found from the north in Poonagari, Jaffna to the south in Tissamaharama bearing several inscriptions, including of the clan name velir, chieftains and minor Tamil kings also residing in the ancient Tamil country.Mahadevan, I. Early Tamil Epigraphy: From the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D., p. 48 Sangam literature from the 3rd century BCE-4th century CE illustrate that a section of the island Eelam, known as NƒÅka-Tivu or NƒÅka-Nadu at the time, was autonomously ruled by local kings in the northern peninsula. The early emporiums of the north and east such as Manthai, Kandarodai (Kadiramalai), Vallipuram, Anaikottai attest Tamil presence through finds of Tamil-Brahmi scripts, coins by the Tamil Three Crowned Kings, Black and red ware pots and beads similar to those found in Arikamedu and Karaikudi. References in epics The twin epics of ancient Tamil Nadu Silappatikaram (1st century CE) and Manimekalai (6th century CE) speak of NƒÅka Nadu across the sea from Kaveripoompuharpattinam, and their civilization which was even more sumptuous than those of the Cheras, the Cholas and the Pandyas. Manimekalai speaks of the great NƒÅka king Valai Vanan who ruled the prosperous NƒÅka Nadu with great splendour and a rich Tamil Buddhist tradition. Cƒ´ttalai CƒÅttanƒÅr, the author of the Manimekalai reflected Tamilakam's perception at the time that NƒÅka Nadu was an autonomous administrative entity, kingdom or nadu stretching across coastal districts, distinguished from the rest of the island also ruled intermittently by Tamil kings; Eela or Irattina Tivu- Nadu.Peter Shalk. SERENDIPITY - ISSUE 02 - THE VALLIPURAM BUDDHA IMAGE - AGAIN Jaffna is an anglicized rendering of the medieval Tamil name for the northern peninsula, Yaalpaanam or Yaalpanapattinam. There is scattered literary and archeological evidence from local and foreign sources describing the division of the whole island in the first few centuries of the common era between two kingdoms. The accounts of 6th century Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes who visited the island around the time of King Simhavishnu of Pallava's rule in Tamilakam reveal the presence of two kings, one of whom was based in Jaffna, home to a great emporium, who ruled the coastal districts. In the ninth century CE, as the medieval Cholas regained strength in the region, a Tamil kingdom based in Jaffna was functioning in rivalry to the south, as described in narratives by Arab travellers such as Soleyman (Suleiman), Ibn Vahab and writing sixty years later, Abu-Zeyd. The historian Al-Masudi identifies Yaalpaanam as Zapage or Zabedje in his 10th century work The Meadows of Gold and describes how the island peninsula's Maharaja (Hindu king) wielded sovereignty over islands opposite the kingdom of Kanyakumari, Karativu island (or Kala island, home to the ancient port of Kalam where ships docked for water on their way to the Nicobar islands), the islands Zadig, Sarendib and Rameswaram Island. He visited the Jaffna country and the lands of Ramanathapuram which extended both inland and on sea at the time. Masudi witnessed the funeral of a Tamil Hindu king during his stay in Jaffna. Muhammad al-Idrisi writes in the 10th century that the king of Jaffna (Jabeh) rules his island country of the same name (in an apparent reference to the minstrel Yaalpaanan to whom the kingdom was gifted) and in the neighbourhood of this country are the islands of Karativu and Eluvaitivu which also obey his rule. Rajadhiraja Chola's conquest of the island led to the fall of four kings there, one of whom, Madavarajah, was the king of Jaffna and, according to historian K. Pillay, a usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty. Inscriptions from the period reveal that the Cholas defeated three Jaffna kings during their conquest of the island. Founding & early history Pandyan tribute paying territories circa 1250, includes what ultimately became the Jaffna kingdom in Sri Lanka The origin of the Jaffna kingdom is obscure and still the subject of controversy among historians.Gunasingam, M Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism, p.53Manogaran, C, The untold story of Ancient Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.22-65Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p.1-53Rasanayagam, M Ancient Jaffna, p.272-321 Among mainstream historians, such as K. M. de Silva, S. Pathmanathan and Karthigesu Indrapala, the widely accepted view is that the Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna began in 1215 with the invasion of a previously unknown chieftain called Magha, who claimed to be from Kalinga in modern India.Nadarajan , V History of Ceylon Tamils, p.72Indrapala, K Early Tamil Settlements in Ceylon, p.16Coddrington, K Ceylon coins and currency, p.74-76 He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II, a foreigner from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time with the help of his soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga, modern Kerala and Damila (Tamil Nadu) regions in India. After the conquest of Rajarata, he moved the capital to the Jaffna peninsula which was more secured by heavy Vanni forest and ruled as a tribute-paying subordinate of the Chola empire of Tanjavur, in modern Tamil Nadu, India. During this period (1247), a Malay chieftain from Tambralinga in modern Thailand named Chandrabhanu invaded the politically fragmented island. Although King Parakramabahu II (1236‚Äì70) from Dambadeniya was able to repulse the attack, Chandrabhanu moved north and secured the throne for himself around 1255 from Magha. This prompted the Pandyan Empire in modern South India to intervene and Chandrabhanu submitted to Pandya rule in 1258. Aryacakravarti dynasty Kotagma inscription of Jaffna kings as displayed in the National Museum of Colombo. When Chandrabhanu embarked on a second invasion of the south, the Pandyas again came to the support of the Sinhalese king and killed Chandrabhanu in 1262 and installed Aryacakravarti, a minister in charge of the invasion, as the king. When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions, successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in Sri Lanka.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.91-92Peebles, History of Sri Lanka, p.31-32 All subsequent kings of the Jaffna Kingdom claimed descent from one Kulingai Cakravarti who is identified with Kalinga Magha by Swami Gnanaprakasar and Mudaliar Rasanayagam while maintaining their Pandyan progenitor's family name.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p.65-66Coddrington, Short history of Ceylon, p.91-92 The origins of the Aryacakravarti are claimed in contemporary court chronicles but modern historians offer competing theories as well. The consensus held by historians is that they were a Pandyan feudatory family and the family is connected to the Ramanathapuram Hindu temple and was of Tamil Brahmin origin.Coddrington,Ceylon Coins and Currency,p.74Coddrington, Short history of Ceylon, p.91‚Äì92Pathmanathan, The Kingdom of Jaffna,p.1‚Äì13de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.132Peebles, The history of Sri Lanka, p.31‚Äì32 C. Rasanayagam investigated why they called of themselves as Arya Chakravarthis; and states that when the Jaffna Kingdom fell into the hands of the Portuguese in 1618, the Jaffna kings claimed to have \\"descended from two Brahmin kings who were appointed by Rama himself after his conquest of Lanka and establishment of the Rameshwavaram temple\\". The Jaffna kings also claimed that Lord Rama himself gave them the title of Arya and granted them the parasol and the emblem of Setu. Rasanayagam therefore suggested that the Brahmin connection may have been mythical and adopted by the later kings as they grew in eminence.Ancient Jaffna: being a research into the history of Jaffna from very early times to the Portug[u]ese period, by C. Rasanayagam, p.293-296 The dynasty claimed titles such as Setukavalan meaning custodians of the Rameswaram temple in modern India, Singaiariyan (from the city of Singai Nagar, another name for their capital Nallur), and Gangainadan, alluding to their origin from the Ganga dynasty or the Ganges region of modern North India. Politically, it was an expanding power in the 13th and 14th century with all regional kingdoms paying tribute to it. However, it met with simultaneous confrontations with the Vijayanagar empire that ruled from Vijayanagara, southern India, and a rebounding Kingdom of Kotte from the south of Sri Lanka. This led to the kingdom becoming a vassal of the Vijyanagar Empire as well as briefly losing its independence under the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467. The kingdom was re-established with the disintegration of Kotte kingdom and the fragmentation of Viyanagar Empire.Peebles, History of Sri Lanka, p.34 It maintained very close commercial and political relationships with the Thanjavur Nayakar kingdom in southern India as well as the Kandyan and segments of the Kotte kingdom. This period saw the building of Hindu temples and a flourishing of literature, both in Tamil and Sanskrit.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.132-133Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p.73-75 Kotte conquest and restoration The position of Jaffna Kingdom with respect to other regional powers circa 1520s The Kotte conquest of the Jaffna Kingdom was led by king Parakramabahu VI's adopted son, Prince Sapumal. This battle took place in many stages. Firstly, the tributaries to the Jaffna Kingdom in the Vanni area, namely the Vanniar chieftains of the Vannimai were neutralised. This was followed by two successive conquests. The first war of conquest did not succeed in capturing the kingdom. It was the second conquest dated to 1450 that eventually was successful. Apparently connected with this war of conquest was an expedition to Adriampet in modern South India, occasioned according to Valentyn by the seizure of a Lankan ship laden with cinnamon. The Tenkasi inscription of Arikesari Parakrama Pandya of Tinnevelly 'who saw the backs of kings at Singai, Anurai,' and else where, may refer to these wars; it is dated between A.D. 1449-50 and 1453‚Äì4.Humphrey William Codrington, A Short History of Ceylon Ayer Publishing, 1970; Kanakasooriya Cinkaiariyan the Aryacakravarti king fled to South India with his family. After the departure of Sapumal Kumara to Kotte, Kanakasooriya Cinkaiarian re- took the kingdom in 1467. Decline & dissolution Andr√© Furtado de Mendon√ßa, the Portuguese commander during the siege Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 where their initial forays were against the south-western coastal Kotte kingdom due to the lucrative monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom enjoyed that was also of interest to the Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities, (which was assumed to be patronizing Portuguese interests) and their support to anti-Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sittawaka. The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports, as an entrypost for military aid arriving from South India. Further, due to its strategic location, it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings.Abeysinghe, T Jaffna Under the Portuguese, p.2 It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600-700 Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p.82-84Gnanaprakasar, S A critical history of Jaffna, p.113-117 Client state The first expedition led by Viceroy Constantino of Braganza in 1560 failed to subdue the kingdom but wrested the Mannar Island from it. Although the circumstances are unclear, by 1582 The Jaffna king was paying a tribute of ten (10) elephants or an equivalent in cash. In 1591, during the second expedition led by Andr√© Furtado de Mendon√ßa, king Puvirasa Pandaram was killed and his son Ethirimana Cinkam was installed as the monarch. This arrangement gave the Catholic missionaries freedom and monopoly in elephant export to the Portuguese,de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.166 which the incumbent king however resisted. He helped the Kandyan kingdom under kings Vimaladharmasuriya I and Senarat during the period 1593‚Äì1635 with the intent of securing help from South India to resist the Portuguese. He however maintained autonomy of the kingdom without overly provoking the Portuguese.Abeysinghe, T Jaffna Under the Portuguese, p.3 Cankili II the unsurper The Royal family, first from the right is Cankili I, who held off the Portuguese Empire. With the death of Ethirimana Cinkam in 1617, Cankili II, a usurper, took control of the throne after killing the regent nominated by the late king. Unable to secure Portuguese acceptance of his kingship, Cankili II through Migapulle Arachchi invited military aid from the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom and allowed corsairs from Malabar to use a base in Neduntivu, hence posting a threat to Portuguese shipping routes through Palk Straight. Cankili II was supported by the Kandyan rulers. After the fall of the Jaffna kingdom, the two unnamed princesses of Jaffna had been married to Senarat's stepsons, Kumarasingha and Vijayapala.An historical relation of the island Ceylon, Volume 1, by Robert Knox and JHO Paulusz, p.43. Cankili II expectably received military aid from the Thanjavur Nayak Kingdom. On his part, Raghunatha Nayak of Thanjavur made attempts to recover the Jaffna Kingdom for his proteage, the Prince of Rameshwaram . However, all attempts to recover the Jaffna Kingdom from the Portuguese met with failure. By June 1619, there were two Portuguese expeditions: a naval expedition that was repulsed by the Malabari corsairs and another expedition by Filipe de Oliveira and his 5,000 strong land army which was able to inflict defeat on Cankili II. Cankili, along with every surviving member of the royal family were captured and taken to Goa, where he was hanged to death. The remaining captives were encouraged to become monks or nuns in the holy orders, and as most obliged, it avoided further claimants to the Jaffna throne. Consequences Over the next 40 years, there were six rebellions against the Portuguese rule led by Karaiyar chiefs, one which were led by Migapulle Arachchi and Varunakulattan with the forces of Thanjavur Nayak kingdom after the invasion by the Kandyan king Senarat I until the Dutch capture of Jaffna fort in 1658. During that period, Portuguese destroyed every Hindu temple and the Saraswathy Mahal library in Nallur, the royal repository of all literary output of the kingdom. Due to excessive taxation, population decreased and many people moved to Ramanathapuram in India and the Vanni districts further south. External commerce was negatively impacted, though elephants, Jaffna's principle export, were traded for saltpetre with various kingdoms in India and sent to Lisbon. Thus, decline in trade made it difficult to pay for essential imports and such items ceased to be imported. In the words of Fern√£o de Queir√≥s, the principle chronicler of Portuguese colonial exploits in Sri Lanka, the people of Jaffna were \\"reduced to the uttermost misery\\" during the Portuguese colonial era.Abeysinghe, T Jaffna Under the Portuguese, p.58-63Gnanaprakasar, S A critical history of Jaffna, p.153-172 Although the Portuguese attempted to completely destroy the Royal family through encouraged celibacy, there are number of families of Sri Lankan Tamil origin who claim descent from the royal family.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p.115 References Category:Jaffna kingdom ","title":"History of the Jaffna Kingdom"},{"id":"34404704","text":"Salina Presbyterian Church (also known as The Crosby Memorial Church) is a historic church at 204 S. 1st East in Salina, Utah.

The windows depict Christ the Good Shepherd, Saint Luke, Ruth, Saint John, Mary and Martha, Christ and the Children, Saint Matthew, Saint Andrew, Saint Mark, Saint Peter, and The Resurrection.‚ÄúOur Memorials‚Äù by Thelma Ellis, 1993 As a downtown church, Good Shepherd has long opened its doors to community groups. Over the years, the Head-Start Program, Migrant Council, and AA are some of the many programs who have met at the church. In 2010, the new Ed and Mary Garrison Educational center, a 7,486 square foot multi-use wing with classrooms, offices, a large sacristy and a nursery. November 24, 2013, the church consecrated a new chapel in the Garrison wing, the Santa Maria Virgen Chapel. The chapel is a dedicated space for El Buen Pastor, the Latino Mission of Good Shepherd. Formerly, El Buen Pastor worshipped in the main Nave and Sanctuary of Good Shepherd. Worship services in English and Spanish can be held at the same time, enabling both groups to have Sunday School together before the service and fellowship afterward. In 2013, with donations from the congregation and community, the church completed a restoration of the sanctuary. The restoration preserved the original building, repointing stone walls, repairing the bell tower and cleaning and protecting the stained glass windows.

Career He was educated at the Royal Military College, Marlow, and given a commission in the 1st Royal Dragoons by the Duke of York on 7 May 1812, serving with his regiment in the Spanish peninsula. When it was reduced in 1814 he exchanged into the 6th Dragoons on 13 April 1815, with whom he served in Belgium and France. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo and at the entry of the allied armies into Paris. He was placed on the half-pay list on 25 March 1816. The next year Watson entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn, and by hard work soon became competent to practise as a special pleader, and continued to do so until 1832, when he was called to the bar in Lincoln's Inn. He joined the northern circuit, where he found work and became popular. In 1841 he entered the House of Commons as liberal member for Kinsale, for which borough he sat till 1847.

Background  Olga Lengyel was born on October 19, 1909 in Transylvania, then part of Hungary. In 1944, she was deported with her parents, husband and two children to Auschwitz-Birkenau. She eventually secured work in the infirmary at Auschwitz, a position which made her survival more likely. Olga survived Auschwitz, the only one of her family to do so. Her husband, Mikl√≥s Lengyel, died on the Death March. After the war, she emigrated to the United States via Odessa and France. Olga married Gustav Aguire and moved to Havana, but returned to New York City in 1962 and founded the Memorial Libraryhttp://www.thememoriallibrary.org/about/olga-lengyel in Manhattan. The mission of the Memorial Library is to support Holocaust education and to help teachers from across the United States as well as other countries promote an agenda for social justice. She died on April 15, 2001 in New York City at age 92.  Book   Early life  In 1944, Olga Lengyel worked as a surgical assistant in Cluj (original name Kolozsv√°r), the capital of Transylvania, at the clinic owned by her husband Mikl√≥s, a Berlin-educated surgeon. As early as 1943, the Lengyels had heard about German atrocities against civilians in occupied territories. However, they refused to believe what they considered \\"fantastic rumors\\". In May 1944, Dr. Lengyel was summoned to the police station in Cluj (despite being a Christian) and did not return. When Olga was told that her husband was to be immediately deported to Germany, she insisted that she and her children be allowed to join him. So that the family would not be separated, Olga's parents also joined Mikl√≥s at the train station for the trip to Germany. Suddenly, the station was surrounded by soldiers and the Lengyel family and other hapless passengers were forced into crowded cattle cars. By the time the train arrived in Auschwitz, on the seventh day, many of the deportees had died and the train seemed to Olga \\"as so many coffins\\".  Auschwitz-Birkenau  Upon arrival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, young men, including Mikl√≥s, were selected for slave labor, while Olga's parents and children were sent \\"to the left\\", that is, directly to the gas chambers. After Olga's group was admitted to the camp, she was told by old inmates that the burnt, sweetish smell came from the \\"camp bakery\\". Over the next several weeks Olga's naivet√© gave way to the sober realization that Auschwitz-Birkenau was an extermination camp, where internees were sent to die in the gas chambers and burnt in the crematoria when they were judged sufficiently enfeebled to be no longer useful for slave labor. The conditions in the barracks were abominable, with 1500 persons eating out of twenty bowls which were used for chamber pots at night. The soup distributed at midday often could not be consumed without holding one's nose, while the six and a half ounces of bread given each inmate in the evening contained a high proportion of sawdust. Olga noted that the camp was operated in a capricious, even contrarian manner, with women who were intellectuals, or were in poor physical condition, often given backbreaking physical work, while illiterates might be assigned office jobs. At one roll call Olga wrapped herself in a woolen garment to combat the cold. This was considered a serious infringement of discipline, and Olga was selected for the gas chamber. The selected were surrounded by ethnic German internees and Stubediensts (inmate police) so that none would escape. When the gas chamber truck arrived, Olga strode away purposefully in the momentary confusion, carrying a stick (a symbol of authority at Auschwitz) she had found on the ground. Three weeks after her arrival in Auschwitz, Olga was propositioned by a Polish prisoner, a carpenter who was working in the women's camp. He suggested a food for sex exchange, but Olga, though starving, demurred. Another woman in her barrack, who accepted the offer, contracted syphilis. Such arrangements were relatively common in the women's camp. Women with such \\"friends\\" were not only better nourished, but enjoyed a certain distinction because men were in such short supply. After Olga had been several weeks in the camp, a call came for internees with medical experience. Olga was one of the women drafted to work at the new, but ramshackle, infirmary. With a staff of five for circa 35,000 women the work load was overwhelming. What disturbed Olga the most was the treatment of contagious cases, who were sent to the hospital where selections for the gas chamber were frequent. Olga makes a distinction between organization (stealing from the Germans) and common thievery from fellow inmates. Items stolen from Canada, the name of the service depot where confiscated goods were sorted and stored, often wound up as bartered goods on the thriving black market in the camp, thus making the lives of internees more bearable. In this fashion, organization was ennobled as an act of social solidarity and resistance. Olga and the other women in the infirmary were responsible for the delivery of newborns in the camp. However, unless a child were stillborn, both mother and newborn were sent to the gas chambers. Olga's companions wrestled with this ethical dilemma and eventually decided to save the mothers by inducing stillbirths. \\"And so, the Germans succeeded in making murderers of even us\\", mused Olga. The mass liquidation of the Jews of Hungary in the summer of 1944 was without precedent even at Birkenau. Ten transports arrived daily and 400 Greeks from transports from Athens and Corfu were ordered into the Sonderkommando. Amazingly, the Greeks refused to kill the Hungarians. They declared that they preferred to die first. Olga worked on various commandos, including the \\"Esskommando\\" (food service kommando) and the \\"Scheisskommando\\" (latrine cleaning detail). Both of these were preferable to senseless work requiring carrying stones, bricks or mud, then returning them to their original places. The purpose of such work was to wear down the inmates physically and mentally and to make them candidates for selection.  SS doctors  Although Camp Commandant Joseph Kramer, who once beat a woman infirmary patient to death with his truncheon, had certainly earned the designation \\"the beast of Auschwitz and Belsen\\", Olga singled out Dr. Joseph Mengele for special scorn. As chief selector for new arrivals at Birkenau Station, Mengele was the top producer of victims for the gas chambers. However, surprise selections were his specialty. He would show up at the infirmary or the hospital at his whim, whistling operatic arias, and order women to the right or left indifferently. Sometimes it was not possible to tell which the condemned group was until Mengele made his final pronouncement. \\"How we hated this charlatan!\\", writes Olga. Mengele performed medical experiments on inmates. His passion was twins and dwarfs. When the Czech camp was exterminated, Mengele gave orders to spare a dozen sets of twins. When a family of five dwarfs arrived on one transport, Mengele was \\"beside himself with joy\\". Several Nazi doctors carried out scientific experiments at Auschwitz for the benefit of the Wehrmacht, such as seeing how long a man could survive in extreme conditions. Thus, it was established, with scientific precision, how long it took death to come after scaldings at different temperatures. Other studies were inspired by \\"racial science\\", such as attempts to change the eye and hair color and studies on artificial insemination and sterilization.  Selections  Selections in the women's camp were made by SS Aufseherin Elisabeth Hasse and Irma Grese. The latter was visibly pleased by the terror her presence inspired in the women at roll call. She had a penchant for selecting not only the sick and the weak but any woman who had retained vestiges of her former beauty. Grese inspired virulent hatred in Olga. Grese was only twenty two and had several lovers among the SS in the camp, including Mengele. After she strong-armed the inmate surgeon at the infirmary into performing her illegal abortion, Irma disclosed that she planned a career in the movies after the war. Olga felt that Irma's meticulous grooming, custom fitted clothes, and overuse of perfume were part of a deliberate act of sadism among the ragged women prisoners.  Auschwitz underground and revolt  As a member of the infirmary staff, Olga had relatively unrestricted access to various areas of Auschwitz-Birkenau and was recruited by the underground organization of Auschwitz. She participated in covert resistance activities, including the smuggling of explosives. Through her underground contacts she learned details of the gas chambers and crematoria. She even obtained extermination statistics from a French doctor attached to the Sonderkommando...1,314,000 gassed and cremated at Auschwitz- Birkenau in May‚ÄìJuly, 1944 (a staggering total for just three months). On October 7, 1944, the Sonderkommando staged a revolt, blowing up one of the crematoria with explosives provided by the underground. The Sonderkommando of one crematorium used the general confusion to cut the barbed wire and escape. When the revolt was suppressed, using soldiers of the Wehrmacht with automatic weapons, 430 members of the Sonderkommando were executed.  Evacuation and the death march  After midnight on January 17, 1945, all patient records from the hospital were burned, and Olga and other hospital personnel were informed of the imminent evacuation of Auschwitz. However, patients were to stay behind. In a panic over the likelihood of being executed, if left behind, patients dragged themselves out of their beds wrapped in blankets. However, the SS chased all the sick and the weak back to the barracks. Olga, with the help of some friends, broke into the warehouse and liberated loaves of bread for the journey. The women, some 6,000 souls, were lined up in groups of five. \\"We were leaving Birkenau still alive!\\" marveled Olga. During the first day of the March Olga counted 119 corpses, from previous columns, along the road in a 20-minute period and witnessed the execution of Dr. Rozsa, an elderly doctor who had fallen behind. Clearly, the SS were executing stragglers. This knowledge congealed her determination to escape. Olga and her friends Magda and Lujza tried to stay at the front of the column so that, if they had to stop briefly, they would not drop to the rear where SS guards, fearing that they would get 'rescued' by the Bolshevik Jews liberating the camp, would shoot them.  Escape and liberation  The first night was spent in a barn, and Olga and her friends arose early because they wanted to be near the front of the column. A group of 25 prisoners led by the SS were impatient and started early, so that a large gap developed between the lead group and the rest of the women. Olga and her friends ran after and the lead group ignoring cries of \\"Stehen bleiben!\\" (\\"Stop!\\"), and with bullets whistling over their heads, they disappeared in the darkness. The three women spent the night in a barn and then in the house of sympathetic Poles. When the last Germans came through the village, ahead of the Red Army, they took a large number of women from the village as hostages and Olga was one of the captives. Olga was bound to a cart by her hands and compelled to go on another forced march. Olga gnawed at the ropes tying her hands, and on the third night finally freed herself. The following night Russian troops liberated the area and Olga was saved.  Analysis  Originally published in 1946 in French, Five Chimneys is one of the most detailed personal accounts of Auschwitz-Birkenau. Olga was an inmate in the women's barracks at Birkenau for seven months in 1944-1945 and her narrative highlights issues of special importance to women. In this sense, Five Chimneys may be viewed as complementary to Primo Levi's If This is a Man ‚Äì Survival in Auschwitz or Elie Wiesel's Night. (Personal account of the Holocaust) It is telling that the Germans used deception to disguise the existence of the extermination camps. Thus, Olga was told that her husband was being deported to Germany (not Auschwitz) and she was not forbidden to join him. Allowing the families of arrested Jewish men to join them in transports to \\"work camps in Germany\\" (and to bring their valuables) was more effective (and lucrative) than a general roundup of Jews, which might have led to panic and resistance. The deception continued inside the camps. Thus inmates of Auschwitz-Birkenau referred to the crematoria as \\"the camp bakery\\". The use of this euphemism was driven by the overriding need for discretion. Any inmates found spreading \\"false propaganda\\" were sent to the \\"camp bakery\\" themselves. The naming of the Sonderkommando (special commando), whose job it was to burn the victims' corpses, and the designation of the cards of SchutzH√§ftlingen ‚Äì protected prisoners marked for execution with the letters SB \\"Sonderbehandlung\\" ‚Äì special treatment, was all part of the grand deception. In fact, deportees who were designated for the gas chambers upon arrival perished without a trace. They were not names, simply crematoria statistics. Many of the ordinary inmates of Birkenau were not tattooed, and when they died of malnutrition or beatings or when they were selected for the gas chambers, they too died without a trace. Those who were tattooed were never assigned numbers higher than 200,000. As the prisoners died, the numbers were simply reused. Thus, the Germans hoped to obfuscate the magnitude of the crime. Olga was not tattooed on arrival to the camp, but was tattooed later with the number 25,403 on her right arm when she obtained a position at the infirmary in Birkenau. A British military investigator mentions her tattoo in his report of May 4, 1945.Special Operations Executive, 1940‚Äì1946 Series 1, Special Operations in Western Europe Part 3: Germany, 1936‚Äì1945 HS 6/627 From a report on German 'Extermination Camps' (Vernichtungslager), May 4, 1945 http://www.ampltd.co.uk/digital_guides/special_operations_executive_series_1_parts_1_to_5/extracts- from-documents-part-3.aspx Olga speaks of her tattoo in the novel and the numbering process that she observed during her time in the camp. Olga's group had their hair shorn by inmate barbers. However, a German officer intervened in Olga's case, saying: \\"Don't clip that one's hair\\". Olga, puzzled, but innately suspicious of being singled out, stood in line anyway and had her hair shorn. She muses, \\"one could expect no mercy (from the Germans), except at an ugly price\\". Her instincts were probably right; being an attractive woman she was, without realizing it, probably selected for the camp brothel. When the German officer returned and saw her bare skull, he was outraged and slapped her. Criminals comprised a high percentage of camp functionaries, while university professors might be in the Scheisskommando (latrine cleaning detail). The Germans enjoyed these paradoxes and capricious decisions and ever-changing rules (whose infraction would be punished savagely) may well have been part of a deliberate attempt to induce apathy and lessen the likelihood of resistance. Although the survival instinct is powerful, some inmates chose to sacrifice themselves rather than be reduced to brutes or even murderers. Thus, the example of the 400 Greeks who chose to die rather than work in the Sonderkommando is inspirational. In fact, it is these acts of humanity among the carnage which reinforced Olga's will to live and, in her words: \\"It is that hope which keeps me alive.\\" Five Chimneys is similar to Thanks to My Mother by Schoschana Rabinovici, in the acute powers of observation and memory of the respective authors. However, whereas some of the events, especially those of a sexual nature, were over the head of the eleven- year-old narrator of Thanks to My Mother, Olga Lengyel describes such events with an unflinching gaze. The physical examination (oral, rectal, vaginal, urethral) given to the nude women arrivals at Auschwitz-Birkenau, while German soldiers chuckled suggestively, is just one example.

These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to copyright infringement (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon user-generated content. The move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, including Reddit and the English Wikipedia, considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Others, such as Google, Mozilla, and Flickr, soon featured protests against the acts. Some shut down completely, while others kept some or all of their content accessible. According to protest organizer Fight for the Future, more than 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest.Wortham, Jenna (2012-01-19). \\"Public outcry over antipiracy bills began as grassroots grumbling\\". New York Times. Retrieved 2012-01-21. In addition to the online protests, there were simultaneous physical demonstrations in several U.S. cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, and separately during December 2011 a mass boycott of then‚Äìsupporter GoDaddy. The protests were reported globally. The January protest, initially planned to coincide with the first SOPA hearing of the year, drew publicity and reaction. Days prior to the action, the White House issued a statement that it would \\"not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\\" On January 18 itself, more than 8 million people looked up their representative on Wikipedia, 3 million people emailed Congress to express opposition to the bills, more than 1 million messages were sent to Congress through the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a petition at Google recorded over 4.5 million signatures, Twitter recorded at least 2.4 million SOPA-related tweets, and lawmakers collected \\"more than 14 million names‚Äîmore than 10 million of them voters‚Äîwho contacted them to protest\\" the bills. During and after the January protest, a number of politicians who had previously supported the bills expressed concerns with the proposals in their existing form, while others withdrew their support entirely. Internationally, \\"scathing\\" criticism of the bills was voiced from World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, as well as the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda. Some observers were critical of the tactics used; the Boston Herald described the service withdrawals as evidence of \\"how very powerful these cyber-bullies can be.\\" Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Chris Dodd stated that the coordinated shutdown was \\"an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today.\\" Others such as The New York Times saw the protests as \\"a political coming of age for the tech industry.\\" By January 20, 2012, the political environment regarding both bills had shifted significantly. The bills were removed from further voting, ostensibly to be revised to take into consideration the issues raised, but according to The New York Times probably \\"shelved\\" following a \\"flight away from the bill\\". Opposers noted the bills had been \\"indefinitely postponed\\" but cautioned they were \\"not dead\\" and \\"would return.\\" Background Background to bills The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) are bills that were introduced into the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in the last quarter of 2011. Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against illegal content or activities on U.S.-based sites, action is more difficult against overseas websites. SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S.-based funding (particularly advertising), payment processors, appearances on search engines, and visibility on web browsers, instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S.-based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the DNS system, a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world. Supporters included, but were not limited to, media companies and industry associations such as the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Entertainment Software Association. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States. Those opposed included a mixture of technology and Internet firms and associations, content creators such as the Wikipedia community, free software authors, free speech organizations, lawmakers, and other websites and organizations, as well as members of the public using their services. They generally identified two main areas of severe side-effects: (1) effects on Internet websites, communities and user-generated content, and (2) effects on critically fundamental internet architecture and security: * Effects on websites, web communities and user- generated content - The scope, language, definitions, procedures, remedies, and provision for immunity following wrongful allegations was seen as insufficiently narrow and well-defined. Legal analysts suggested that draconian court orders could be obtained without undue difficulty to \\"take down\\" an entire site, without dialog or notification, due process, or liability for compensation if incorrect, even if the site were legitimate. Perceived consequences included serious undermining of free speech on the Internet, devastation of the Internet's communities, and widespread closure and chilling of websites, particularly those including user-created content or organizations such as libraries providing reference information. Observers also noted the laws could be used strategically against legitimate competitors or during elections. * Effects on critical Internet architecture - Technical experts testified that the proposed DNS measures conflicted with the fundamental basis of the Internet and would \\"break\\" ongoing attempts to make the net more secure against malicious use. Google's policy director, Bob Boorstin, stated that a site like YouTube supporting user-generated content \\"would just go dark immediately\\" to comply with the legislation. Tumblr, one of the first websites active in grassroots activism against the bills, added a feature that \\"censored\\" its website on November 16, 2011, and the social media aggregator Reddit also became deeply involved.  Legislative and protest timeline  On November 16, 2011, a first hearing by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee was marked by online protests involving blackened website banners, popularly described as \\"American Censorship Day\\". On December 15, 2011, the first House Judiciary Committee mark-up hearing took place for SOPA, prior to its eventual move to the House floor. During the markup session, several proposed amendments to address technological and other concerns were defeated. The mark-up process was put on hold to be resumed after the new year. Around this time, numerous websites began displaying banners and messages promoting their readerships to contact Congress to stop the progress of the bill, and some websites began to discuss or endorse a possible \\"Internet blackout\\" before any vote on SOPA in the House, as a means of further protest. Reddit was the first major site to announce an \\"Internet blackout\\" for January 18, 2012, and several other sites shortly followed, coordinating actions for that day. A notable political response to the November 2011 protests was the outlining in early December of a bipartisan third, alternative, bill with the support of technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which unusually had been posted on the Internet to allow public comment and suggestions in light of the widespread protests related to the SOPA and PIPA bills. It was formally introduced as the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN) in the Senate on December 17 by Senator Ron Wyden and in the House on January 18 by Representative Darrell Issa. It proposed placing enforcement in the hands of the United States International Trade Commission, keeping provisions that targeted payments and advertising for infringing websites, and tightly targeted wording to avoid many other key areas of concern with SOPA and PIPA. Online discussions of a blackout and concerns over the bills continued unabated after the markup hearing and increased in prominence. On January 11, Senator Patrick Leahy, the main sponsor for PIPA, said of the DNS filtering provision, \\"I will therefore propose that the positive and negative effects of this provision be studied before implemented\\",Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Internet Service Providers And The PROTECT IP Act ; Senator Patrick Leahy - Press Release; January 12, 2012 reported by some papers as removal of those provisions. Opposers deemed this a tactical withdrawal allowing reintroduction at a later stage and ignoring other concerns as well as provisions in PIPA, and evidence that the bill had not been understood or checked by its own creators and that proposals for a blackout were gaining impact. Momentum for the protests continued unchanged since the bills had merely been postponed, and due to their other contentious provisions. Mozilla's SOPA protest, displayed here in Firefox, used censor bars as an ironic graphic device Protests of November 16, 2011 (\\"American Censorship Day\\") On November 16, 2011, SOPA was discussed by the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary. Tumblr, Mozilla, Techdirt, and the Center for Democracy and Technology were among many Internet companies who protested by participating in 'American Censorship Day', by displaying black banners over their site logos with the words \\"STOP CENSORSHIP.\\"  December 2011 boycott of GoDaddy  On December 22, 2011, users at Reddit proposed a boycott and a public day for switching away from then‚ÄìSOPA supporter GoDaddy, the largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world, known as Move Your Domain Day. The date was later set as December 29, 2011. Popular websites that moved domains included imgur,, the Wikimedia Foundation,, and Cheezburger ‚Äî which stated it would remove over 1,000 domains from GoDaddy if they continued their support of SOPA.. On December 23, GoDaddy withdrew its support for SOPA, releasing a statement saying \\"GoDaddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.\\" CEO Warren Adelman stated when asked, that he couldn't commit to changing GoDaddy's position on the record in Congress, but said \\"I'll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that's an important step\\"; when pressed, he said \\"We're going to step back and let others take leadership roles.\\" Further outrage was due to the fact that many Internet sites would be subject to shutdowns under SOPA, but GoDaddy is in a narrow class of exempted businesses that would have immunity, whereas many other domain operators would not. On December 26, 2011, a Google bomb was started against GoDaddy to remove them from the #1 place on Google for the term \\"Domain Registration\\" in retaliation for supporting SOPA.Kohr, Robert \\"A better way to fight SOPA\\" This was then disseminated through Hacker News. Reddit users noted that by December 22, 2011, SOPA supporters were discovering the backlash that could arise from ignoring social media users. Reports up to December 29 described GoDaddy as \\"hemorrhaging\\" customers. On December 25, 2011 (Christmas Day), GoDaddy lost a net 16,191 domains as a result of the boycott. However, on December 29 itself, GoDaddy gained a net of 20,748 domains, twice as many as it lost that day, attributed by Techdirt to a number of causes, in particular customers having moved early, and an appeased customer response to their change of position over SOPA. Protests of January 18, 2012 Protestors Wikimedia community A screenshot of the English Wikipedia landing page, symbolically its only page during the blackout on January 18, 2012 Main pages of the Japanese Wikipedia and the Dutch Wikipedia on January 18, expressing support for the English Wikipedia protest The staff at the Wikimedia Foundation the moment the blackout happened On December 10, 2011, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales drew attention to concerns over SOPA, which he described as a \\"much worse law\\" than the DDL intercettazioni (Wiretapping Bill) in Italy some months earlier, and which was being fast-tracked through the United States Congress under a \\"misleading title\\". He stated he was attending high-level meetings on this, and wanted to gauge the sense of the English Wikipedia community on the issue, and specifically on the question of a blackout similar to that held successfully in October 2011 by Italian Wikipedia editors over the proposed media censorship law in that country: Following initial informal discussions which resulted in a positive response, a formal consultation titled \\"SOPA Initiative\\" was opened by the community to consider specific proposals and preferred options. These included matters such as location (United States only or worldwide), and whether content should be disabled completely or still accessible after a click-through page. Eventually, the discussion led to a decision strongly in favor of a 24-hour global blackout of the site on January 18, disabling normal reading and editing functions, affirmed in a vote of approximately 1,800 editors. The blocking action was purposely not complete; users could access Wikipedia content from the mobile interface or mirror sites, or if they disabled JavaScript or other web browser functions. Within hours of the start of the blackout, many websites posted instructions for disabling the banner, by altering URLs, using browser add-ons such as Adblock Plus or Greasemonkey, or interrupting the page from loading completely. The vote formally affected the English Wikipedia only; other language editions and Wikimedia projects were left free to decide whether to hold their own protests given the potential worldwide impact of the legislation, with technical support on offer from the Foundation. On January 17, 2012, Jimmy Wales affirmed the results of the community's decision and that the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts the English Wikipedia website, would support the community's decision. He called for a \\"public uprising\\" against the proposed legislation, which critics fear would threaten free speech. He added that factors such as funding or donations had not been part of the community's considerations, but the matter had arisen as \\"a principled stand\\" from the community, and that in his view \\"our best long-term prospect for Wikipedia in terms of our survival ... depends on us being principled\\". He commented on editors' reasons for the decision: Wikimedia Executive Director Sue Gardner posted an announcement of the Foundation's support for the blackout proposal on Wikimedia's blog. The post received over 7000 responses from the general public within the first 24 hours of its posting.Wikipedia's community calls for anti-SOPA blackout January 18 Wikimedia Foundation Accessed: 2012-01-17 The blackout was to run for 24 hours starting at 05:00 UTC (midnight Eastern Standard Time) on January 18. Despite the support of those polled for the action, a small number of Wikipedia editors blacked out their own user profile pages or resigned their administrative positions in protest of the blackout; one editor stated his \\"main concern is that it puts the organization in the role of advocacy, and that's a slippery slope\\". Approximately 90% out of the 2097 editors who took part in the votes supported joining the blackout action. It is estimated that only less than half the voters were from the United States, which suggests that Wikipedia acted as a platform for an international community to express its opinion. The most common rationale expressed by about a fifth of the editors was the sentiment that \\"SOPA was perceived as a worldwide threat\\". A majority of editors who opposed the participation were concerned with the perceived dissonance between Wikipedia's encyclopedic ethos, neutrality and active participation in a political issue (sentiment endorsed by about 4% of the vote participants); only 0.3% of participating editors suggested they support a tougher copyright regime. Other websites According to protest organizer Fight for the Future, more than 115,000 websites participated in the protest, including Google and Wikipedia. Websites that participated in the blackout included Cheezburger, Craigslist, Boing Boing, A Softer World, Cake Wrecks, Cyanide & Happiness, Demand Progress, Destructoid, Entertainment Consumers Association. Free Press, Failblog, Newgrounds, Good.is, GOG.com, Gamesradar, Internet Archive, Marxists Internet Archive, Jay is Games, Mojang, MoveOn.org, Mozilla, MS Paint Adventures, Rate Your Music, Reddit, Roblox, Oh No They Didn't, Tucows, blip.tv, Tumblr, TwitPic, Twitter, The Oatmeal, VGMusic, Wikia, WordPress, the webcomic xkcd as well as the corporate site of the Linux distribution openSUSE and the congressional websites of Silicon Valley representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren. Google announced their intention to join the blackout by altering their logo for US visitors for the day, almost entirely obscuring it with an interactive black redaction swath. Clicking through the specially designed logo took readers to an informational page about the bills, and the opportunity to sign a petition to be sent to Congress stating their concerns.A wayback version of google on Jan 18, 2012https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130357/https://www.google.com/ The Mozilla Foundation altered the default start page of their Firefox web browser, blacking it out and providing links with more information on the SOPA/PIPA bills and the opposition to them, and to allow users to email their Congressional representatives. TV Tropes posted black bars atop the web page with the message \\"STOP SOPA\\". Mojang's bestselling game Minecraft made a splash text that said \\"SOPA means LOSER in Swedish!\\" A site called The Spoony Experiment, known for a cute robot mascot called Burton, changed the homepage into a more nightmarish version, involving a nightmarish version of Burton and the words \\"The Spoony Experiment\\" replaced by red text proclaiming \\"The Experiment is Over\\", signifying the proposed death of several websites. Wired magazine's online site used Javascript to place black bars on most of the text on their page, as if the text was redacted, outside of their key article regarding SOPA/PIPA; readers could remove the bars with a mouse click. The photo-sharing website Flickr created the ability for a registered user to \\"censor\\" an unlimited number (up from an initial limit of ten) of photos as demonstration of how SOPA/PIPA regulation would affect the site; the user- selected photographs were greyed out, and included informational text. 4chan ran a banner and \\"censored\\" posts by users on all image boards, which could be viewed by hovering over them. StumbleUpon added numerous links to anti- SOPA/PIPA websites. A video was circulated by the League for Gamers (founded by Mark Kern and supported by ScrewAttack, Extra Credits, and LoadingReadyRun) protesting the Entertainment Software Association's support of SOPA by gathering support to boycott the ESA's popular E3 convention.Stand Together: The Gaming Community vs SOPA and PIPA on ScrewAttack.com Physical demonstrations alt= SOPA-PIPA protest, January 18, 2012, in front of Senators Chuck Schumer's and Kirsten Gillibrand's offices, New York City.

In addition to the online blackouts, protests in cities such as New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle were held on January 18 to raise awareness of the two bills. A series of pickets against the bills were held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Two picketers were arrested.  Reaction  Pre-protest The announcement of the blackout was reported worldwide. Media that covered the story included ABC Australia, CBC, BBC, der Spiegel, Le Figaro, Le Monde, Lib√©ration, Fox News, The Guardian, Menafn, News Limited, Sky News, The Age, The Hindu, The New York Times, Taipei Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The Times of India. Several media organizations including The Washington Post, The Guardian, and NPR encouraged a \\"crowdsourcing solution for those left searching for answers\\" during the Wikipedia blackout by inviting users to ask questions on Twitter using the hashtag #altwiki.David Beard (2012-01-17), Wikipedia Blackout: An #altwiki Band-Aid The Washington Post An executive of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) dubbed the blackout plan an example of the \\"gimmicks and distortion\\" that inflamed passions while failing to solve the problem of copyright infringement by \\"draw[ing] people away from trying to resolve what is a real problem, which is that foreigners continue to steal the hard work of Americans\\".James Rainey, (2012-01-16) Wikipedia to go offline to protest anti-piracy legislation The Los Angeles Times Former U.S. Senator and MPAA Director Chris Dodd stated that the coordinated shutdown was \\"also an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today.\\"MPAA's Chris Dodd takes aim at SOPA strike The Los Angeles Times 2012-01-17 Dick Costolo, CEO of social networking site Twitter, rejected calls for Twitter to join the protest, tweeting that \\"[c]losing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish.\\" Originally, some thought Costolo referred to all of the blackout movements on January 18, but afterwards clarified that he was referring to a hypothetical blackout of Twitter, and that he was supportive of the Wikipedia blackout itself. The sponsor of the bill, Representative Lamar S. Smith, called the blackout a \\"publicity stunt,\\" and stated with reference to Wikipedia that \\"it is ironic a website dedicated to providing information is spreading misinformation about the Stop Online Piracy Act.\\" On January 17, 2012, in response to growing concerns over PIPA and SOPA, the White House stated that it \\"will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\\" January 18 The Wikimedia Foundation reported that there were over 162 million visits to the blacked-out version of Wikipedia during the 24-hour period, with at least 8 million uses of the site's front page to look up contact information for their U.S. Congressional representatives. The usage of Wikipedia's front page increased enormously during the blackout with 17,535,733 page views recorded, compared with 4,873,388 on the previous day. A petition created and linked to by Google recorded over 4.5 million signatures, while the Electronic Frontier Foundation reported that more than 1 million email messages were sent to congressmen through their site during the blackout. MSNBC reported that over 2.4 million Twitter messages about SOPA, PIPA, and the blackouts were made during a 16-hour period on January 18; this included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who had not used the service since 2009, to encourage his followers to contact their congressmen. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a key opponent of the bills, said that \\"lawmakers had collected more than 14 million names - more than 10 million of them voters\\" to protest the legislation. Time reported that before the day had ended, \\"the political dominoes began to fall ... then trickle turned into flood\\". It named ten senators who had announced their switch to opposing the bills and stated that \\"nearly twice that many House members\\" had done so. During the blackout, libraries at several universities used the outage to remind students that the traditional paper encyclopedias were available for research. Students who grew up turning to the internet to look up information were encouraged to visit the library as an alternative source of information. On Twitter, a joke hashtag #factswithoutWikipedia trended with users posting humorous fake \\"facts.\\" \\"Startled\\" Internet users frustrated or angry at their loss of Wikipedia for the day used Twitter as an outlet; politicians likewise turned to Twitter when overwhelmed by the public communications flood in support of the blackout. CTV news in Canada published a \\"survival guide\\" for \\"getting around the blackout\\" on their national website, citing Wikipedia as the answer to \\"burning questions such as \\"Are chinchillas rodents?\\" and \\"What does 'rickrolling' mean?\\" The guide provided detailed instructions on how to circumvent the ban and access the English Wikipedia during the protest. CTV referred to the protest as \\"a date that will live in ignorance.\\" Creative America, a coalition representing movie studios, entertainment unions, and television networks, used the blackout to prompt those affected by it to enjoy other forms of entertainment in place of their normal Internet activities; such ads appeared at Times Square in New York City and on various websites. Post-protest Erik M√∂ller of the Wikimedia Foundation talking about the Blackout at the opening of the San Francisco Wikipedia Hackathon (two days after the blackout) The impact of the coordinated action was generally considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was \\"a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more,\\" further adding \\"You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial.\\" California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had \\"a lot to learn,\\" noting that they don't have grassroots support: \\"There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA.\\" The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy,Weisman, Jonathan (2012-01-18). \\"In fight against piracy bills, new economy rises against old\\". New York Times. Retrieved 2012-01-21. headlined the activism as a \\"political coming of age for the tech industry.\\" James Grimmelmann, an associate professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that \\"Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for. That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.\\" Newspaper editorials had mixed views. The Boston Herald called the protest a \\"hissy fit\\" by \\"Internet powerhouses\\" saying, \\"within hours of the online protest, political supporters of the bill... began dropping like flies, thus proving how very powerful these cyber-bullies can be.\\"\\"A halt to online theft\\" Boston Herald 2012-01-19 The New York Times described the protest as \\"Noted, but as a Brief Inconvenience\\" and, as well, offered an opinion about the protest and possible accomplishments. BBC News technology writer Rory Cellan-Jones was of the opinion that the blackout achieved its objectives but possibly at some cost to Wikipedia's reputation.Rory Cellan-Jones (2012-01-19), \\"Wikipedia - after the blackout\\" BBC News Bill Keller was of the view that \\"Jimmy Wales... assumed a higher profile as a combatant for the tech industry [and] supplied an aura of credibility to a libertarian alliance that ranged from the money-farming Megatrons of Google to the hacker anarchists of Anonymous.\\"Bill Keller (5 February 2012), \\"Steal This Column\\" The New York Times Wikipedia editing levels before, during, and after the blackout Media columnist David Carr wrote in the New York Times that there were two lessons, one being that \\"People who don't understand the Web should not try to re-engineer it\\", and the other that while businesses generally prize their relations with their customers, in the struggle between media and technology companies, the latter have \\"a much more chronic [i.e. ongoing], intimate relationship with consumers\\" and would more likely prevail. Motion Picture Association of America chairman Chris Dodd admitted that the content industry had lost the public relations battle with the Internet industry, adding that \\"[y]ou've got an opponent who has the capacity to reach millions of people with a click of a mouse and there's no fact-checker. They can say whatever they want.\\"Richard Verrier (2012-01-21), \\"Hollywood regroups after losing battle over anti-piracy bills\\" The Los Angeles Times Dodd called for Hollywood and Silicon Valley to work out a compromise on the legislation, but was also criticized for a statement on Fox News to the effect that politicians would risk having campaign funding cut off if they did not support media industry proposals. The legal director of public interest group Public Knowledge was quoted on that organization's website as writing: > Threats like that are no way to conduct the serious, sober discussions > needed to figure out exactly what ails the movie industry and to come up > with solutions. It was Hollywood's arrogance in pushing bills through > Congress without proper vetting that caused them to be withdrawn; these > threats also are not helpful to figuring out what ails the industry and how > to solve their issues. Among other media industry reactions, Creative America was of the view that \\"[t]hey've misidentified this issue as an issue about your Internet, your Internet is being jeopardized. In fact their business model is being asked to be subjected to regulation. They're misleading their huge base.\\"Alan Fram (2012-01-21), \\"INFLUENCE GAME: Online companies win piracy fight\\" Associated Press Recording Industry Association of America President Cary Sherman noted that the major television networks supported the legislation but, unlike Wikipedia and Google, did not use their platforms to try to shape public opinion: \\"when Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations.\\"Cary H. Sherman (7 February 2012), \\"What Wikipedia Won't Tell You\\" The New York Times Rep. Lamar Smith, who sponsored SOPA, flatly stated in a commentary on Fox News that \\"This bill does not threaten the Internet. But it does threaten the profits generated by foreign criminals who target the U.S. market and willfully steal intellectual property by trafficking in counterfeit or pirated goods.\\" While speaking on the Senate floor on January 23 Senator Leahy reiterated his objections to the protests, saying: > Websites like Wikipedia and YouTube... would not be subject to the > provisions of the bill.

Speaking at an industry event in Florida he praised the protests by major sites for the attention they had drawn, and described the bills as a \\"grave threat to the openness of the Internet\\" that \\"had to be stopped\\": Two days later, Vice- President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes described the bills as \\"bad legislation\\" that would \\"threaten the basic foundation of the success of the web\\". She also said there \\"should be safeguarding benefits of open net.\\" \\"Speeding is illegal too but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway,\\" she said.  Related protests  SOPA and PIPA protests were overlapped and followed by protests against ACTA which has a similar sense. The ACTA treaty was signed by 22 Member States in Europe and was expected to be signed before March 2012 by the other states left, Cyprus, Estonia, Netherlands and Slovakia, and thus would have gained legal force for the whole European Union. On February 11, more than 200 European cities took part in a widespread protest against ACTA.ACTA ignites concerns about threat to Internet freedom, USA Today, February 11, 2012Activists rally to give ACTA the cold shoulder, euronews Although protests were held in Europe, the signing of ACTA was led by USA, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore, which were first to sign the treaty at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo. However, the concerns of ACTA are much related and raised after the protests against SOPA and PIPA which directed the public attention to bills and acts that may threaten Internet and civic liberties.  Legislative impact and aftermath  During the day of January 18, six of PIPA's sponsors in the Senate, including Marco Rubio, PIPA's co-sponsor, Orrin Hatch, Kelly Ayotte, Roy Blunt, John Boozman, and Mark Kirk, stated that they would withdraw their support for the bills. Several other congressmen issued statements critical of the current versions of both bills. By the following day, eighteen of the 100 senators, including eleven of the original sponsors of the PIPA bill, had announced that they no longer supported PIPA. By one account, the shift in stated positions on SOPA/PIPA by members of Congress had gone overnight from 80 for and 31 against to 65 for and 101 against. An initial floor vote was scheduled for January 24, prior to the Internet blackout, but following these responses, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that the vote will be postponed, urging the bill's main sponsor, Senator Patrick Leahy, to work out compromise in the bill \\"to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the Internet.\\" Similarly, the House Judiciary Subcommittee chairman, Representative Lamar S. Smith, announced that further voting on SOPA would be placed on hold \\"until there is wider agreement on a solution.\\" Later, an updated The New York Times news story reported that the two bills were \\"indefinitely shelved.\\" House Committee on Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa commented that \\"This unprecedented effort has turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren't used to being told 'no'\\", describing the events as a \\"responsible and transparent exercise of freedom of speech\\". Opposers cautioned that although \\"postponed,\\" the bills were \\"not dead\\" and \\"would return.\\" Months after the protests, in July 2012, The New York Times summarized events as follows: > Wikipedia went black to protest SOPA and more than seven million people > signed online petitions, many of which said the bills would \\"break the > Internet.\\" Congress, overwhelmed by the popular opposition, quickly > backpedaled, leaving the legislation to die. The development of the electronic grassroots campaign has been the subject of academic analysis. Other proposed laws According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), \\"SOPA and PIPA are really only the tip of the iceberg. The same forces behind these domestic U.S. laws have continued to both push for other states to pass similar domestic laws, as well as to secretly negotiate international trade agreements that would force signatory nations to conform to the same legal standards.\\" Examples cited by EFF include: * The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a pending international treaty signed by the United States in October 2011, is similar to SOPA. On 4 July 2012, the European Parliament declined its consent, effectively rejecting it, 478 votes to 39, and 165 abstentions. * The Trans- Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPP) - IP terms controversy * Special 301 Reports - a United States law mandating annual global copyright and IP law reports, explicitly to protect and act in favour of US intellectual property owners against any other country's domestic or foreign policies or actions not conforming to United States' positions. Threat of action under Special 301 has been used to insert U.S. lobbyist-written legislation into other countries' laws. Examples considered \\"similar to SOPA/PIPA\\" by other analyses: * Ireland's proposed law \\"S.I. No. 337/2011 ‚Äî European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users' Rights) Regulations 2011\\" has been described by news media as \\"Ireland's SOPA.\\" As a statutory instrument, no parliamentary vote is required to pass this into law. * Russia's proposed law Duma Bill 89417-6, titled \\"On protection of children from information harmful to their health and development\\" has also been described as \\"Russia's SOPA\\": poorly defined (overly broad and unclear definitions of which sites are liable under its censorship provisions), and using a flawed blocking mechanism (the blocking of IP addresses, which can be shared by many sites). * USA's CISPA bill (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act), which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies, has been described as \\"worse than SOPA and PIPA\\".

He currently serves as the Head of Advisors to the Presidency of the Republic in the second administration of Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. Larroulet graduated from high school at Colegio Sagrados Corazones de Manquehue and he obtained his Business Administration degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and a master's degree in economics from the University of Chicago, United States of America. Larroulet was a professor at the Universidad Cat√≥lica, Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, and at the School of Economics of the Universidad de Chile. He was a visiting researcher at the Institute of The Americas, the University of California, San Diego, United States of America. He was Dean of the Economics and Business Faculty at the Universidad del Desarrollo. He is currently a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and of the Social Science Academy, Politics and Moral, of the Chile Institute. Larroulet has experience in the design and implementation of political policies. He was Chief of Staff of the Treasury under former Minister Hern√°n B√ºchi, and was the Executive Director of the Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo. From that position, he advised the National Congress on a wide range of policy subjects and he is a member of several commissions, such as the one that led to the General Education Law as well as the new Corporate Governance agreement for Codelco. Larroulet‚Äôs contributions have been recognized with distinctions on several occasions, such as Economist of the Year in 2009 by the newspaper El Mercurio. In May 2010 he was distinguished with the Professional Achievement Award 2010 by the University of Chicago, being the only Latin-American which has received this recognition, granted since 1967.

Criticism  Since assuming as Head of Advisors to the Presidency of the Republic during the second administration of Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, Cristi√°n Larroulet's performance received public criticism. Most critics described him as exerting an excessive and uncontested influence in key government decisions, pointed to his alleged efforts in defending the neoliberal paradigm within the Pi√±era government after the Chilean Protests from October 2019, and to his refusal to make \\"ideological concessions\\" to provide state aid in the frame of the Coronavirus Pandemic in Chile. While commenting the performance of Pi√±era's administration during the Chilean Protests, the education expert Mario Waissbluth described both Pi√±era's and Larroulet's management of the crisis as \\"ideological and suicidal governmental stinginess\\". Criticism of Larroulet has also come from Pi√±era's own government coalition. Referring to him, Mayor Germ√°n Codina from political party Renovaci√≥n Nacional, pointed in December 2019 that \\"some people advise the president badly\\" and that \\"politics is not just numbers.\\" In April 2020, after President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era questioned the realization of Chile's 2020 National Plebiscite during a television interview, the deputy of his coalition, Ximena Ossand√≥n, accused that in Chile \\"there is an extreme right-wing sector that never wanted the plebiscite\\", and added \\"I believe there are traces of the Head of Advisors Cristi√°n Larroulet again (...)

New Zealand is an island nation that is geographically isolated from any significant landmass. For this reason the species that are present evolved in the absence of organisms from elsewhere and display a high degree of endemism. Notable is the lack of land based mammals, except for two species of bat. Indigenous species are at risk from population decline or extinction if any invasive species are introduced. The Biosecurity Act 1993, which was a world first for biosecurity control, was passed to \\"restate and reform the law relating to the exclusion, eradication, and effective management of pests and unwanted organisms\\". The Ministry for Primary Industries is the government department in charge of overseeing New Zealand's biosecurity. The National Animal Identification and Tracing system for tracing livestock was introduced in 2012, but in 2017 the Mycoplasma bovis outbreak investigation indicated that it was not being fully complied with. Border controls As well as biosecurity border controls where there is international passenger and freight movement, government officials have also carried out biosecurity controls within the country. Visitors to New Zealand are most commonly fined for bringing fishing gear, seeds, fruits, bamboo and wooden products at the border. At sea and airports cargo, passengers and passenger baggage is checked for unwanted organisms. Any that is found is incinerated. Passengers must sign a declaration form stating that they do not have anything that constitutes a biosecurity risk to New Zealand. At border control locations such as airports beagles are used for detecting material that constitutes a biosecurity risk because they are relatively small and less intimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards. If there is a threat of the spread of unwanted organisms within New Zealand containment measures are carried out. Didymo, an invasive algae that was discovered in New Zealand in 2004, has been the subject of a nationwide campaign to prevent its spread. To prevent the spread of the spores of kauri dieback disease it is recommended that pathways in the forests are used and equipment should be cleaned before leaving an area where there are kauri trees.  Combating the Queensland Fruit Fly  The Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tyroni) has caused over $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian fruit crops. Thus, this species poses a risk to biosecurity in New Zealand. A fruit fly exclusion zone (FFEZ) limits the movement of fruit between Australian states and New Zealand. 2017 Mycoplasma bovis outbreak On 21 July 2017 the Ministry for Primary Industries was informed that some cattle near Oamaru in the South Island were Mycoplasma bovis positive. Up until then, New Zealand and Norway were the only OECD countries free of the disease. (The disease is not hazardous to humans.) Initially it was thought that the disease had been contained within South Canterbury. However, subsequently, some 26,000 cattle were culled and in May 2018 the minister, Damien O'Connor, announced that the government had decided (after consultation with farmers) that elimination of the disease was proposed. This would require the culling of some 146,000 cattle over about two years, and would cost $886 million, compared with the cost of $1.2 billion to control the disease. Eradication would also be a \\"world first\\". It appeared that perhaps 70% of farmers were not fully complying with the requirements since 2012 to track movements of cattle, particularly calves sold \\"for cash\\". Another possibility is the illegal importing of drugs by veterinary companies. The latest estimate of the number to be culled was 152,000 in June 2018; 126,000 plus the 26,000 already culled. In August 2018, a Southland farmer was charged under the Biosecurity Act regarding importation of some farm machinery. Other notable incursions There have been a number of biosecurity breaches in New Zealand, and on occasion widespread eradications of pest organisms have been carried out. *The Painted apple moth was discovered in Auckland in 1999. A biocontainment area was set up and a controversial spray programme carried out to eradicate the moth. Claims that it caused cancer were not upheld. *A single male Gypsy Moth was caught in a surveillance trap in 2003 within the limits of Hamilton city. An aerial insecticide application programme was initiated to prevent the establishment of any potential population. *The Varroa mite was thought to have become established in New Zealand due to a queen bee being smuggled into the country. *The Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) was discovered in Auckland in 2012 and 2015, resulting in a temporary ban on the movement of plant products in parts of Auckland. *The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (PSA), which affects kiwifruit, is thought to have arrived in New Zealand 18 months prior to observed symptoms of the disease. In 2018 growers (but not other operators) won a court case against the government, which found that the government breached its \\"duty of care\\" to growers, and the 2010 outbreak was on the \\"balance of probabilities\\" due to the importing of kiwifruit pollen by a Te Puke company from 2007 to 2010. *Myrtle rust (Puccinia psidii ), first found in a Kerikeri nursery in May 2017. The rust has now been confirmed at more than 100 locations across Taranaki, Te Puke, Waikato, Northland, Auckland and Wellington. In May 2005 a hoax claim was made that foot and mouth disease had been released on Waiheke Island and would be released elsewhere unless money was paid and tax reforms made. A full agricultural exotic disease response was initiated. No livestock were allowed to enter or leave the island and stock on the island was tested every 48 hours for symptoms of the virus, which would devastate New Zealand's agricultural exports. After three weeks of testing, no infected animals were detected and the response staff were stood down.

He has received numerous international awards in recognition of his work, including the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, and is often referred to as the \\"Sakharov of Vietnam\\". Background and first arrest Doan Viet Hoat was born on 24 December 1942 in H√† T√¢y, roughly ten miles from Hanoi. He left H√† T√¢y in 1954 to pursue his education. Doan received a PhD in education and college administration from Florida State University in 1971. Returning to Vietnam that same year, he became a professor and later vice president of Van Hanh Buddhist University, the only private Buddhist university in Saigon. He also acted as editor of the university magazine, Tu Tuong (\\"Thought\\"). In April 1975, the southern Army of the Republic of Vietnam lost control of Saigon in the Vietnam War, and the city fell to the Vietnam People's Army. Van Hanh University was confiscated by the new communist government, and its buildings turned into dorms. Doan was detained the following year in a mass round-up of intellectuals with United States ties, on the grounds that though he might not be a CIA agent at the moment, he could \\"become one at any time.\\" On 29 August 1976, he was sent to a re-education camp, where he would be imprisoned without trial for twelve years in a cell shared with 40 other people. Release to second arrest In February 1989, Doan was released, following an agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam that Vietnam would close all re-education camps as a step toward normalizing ties. He was then advised by friends to join his brother and two eldest sons in the US, the latter of whom had left Vietnam as boat children. Following a trip through the country with his wife and youngest son, however, on which Doan Viet Hoat saw the poverty of his home village as well as a woman who spent her days tied to a pole for criticizing her village's communist officials, he opted to stay and continue to protest through his writing. Within months of his release, he began editing the underground newsletter Dien Dan Tu Do (\\"Freedom Forum\\"). The newsletter focused on presenting pro- democratic viewpoints as well as articles from Vietnamese people living abroad. In the newsletter's opening issue, Doan wrote: \\"A new struggle has started ... It is the war against poverty, backwardness and arbitrariness. It is the aspiration toward a rich, strong, progressive, free and democratic Vietnam. And in this new struggle, there can be only one winner, the nation and people of Vietnam; and only one loser, the forces of dogmatism, arbitrariness and backwardness.\\" Over the next year, Dien Dan Tu Do published three more issues, which were circulated clandestinely throughout Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. Doan also sent articles of his own abroad for publication. On 17 November 1990, security forces arrested Doan at his home for his involvement with the newsletter; seven other contributors were also arrested without charge. Doan was then held incommunicado for the next six months. In 1992, he was denounced by the government-controlled newspaper S√†i G√≤n Gi·∫£i Ph√≥ng as the leader of a \\"reactionary group\\" and accused of plotting rebellion. In March 1993, all eight journalists were brought to trial with government-selected legal counsel, and after a trial lasting less than two days, found guilty of \\"founding a reactionary organization\\" and \\"conspiring to overthrow the government\\". Doan was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment; his colleagues were given sentences ranging from eight months to 16 years. On 19 July 1993, Doan's sentence was reduced by an appeals court to 15 years' imprisonment. Second imprisonment and international response Doan's sentence was protested by a number of human rights organizations, including the United Nations, whose Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that Doan's sentence was arbitrary detention and therefore a violation of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam was a state party. Amnesty International protested the conditions of his trial, named him a prisoner of conscience, and called for his immediate release, as did The Committee to Protect Journalists and the World Association of Newspapers. Human Rights Watch also protested the sentence and called on the US government to pressure Vietnam for Doan's release. Doan continued to write in the months following his sentence, smuggling out several essays from prison. In retaliation, prison authorities continued to transfer him to prisons with harsher and harsher conditions. Despite his assignment to a hard labor gang, he went on hunger strike to protest the conditions of his imprisonment in 1994. Finally Doan was placed in solitary confinement in the comparatively remote Thanh Cam prison in the country's north; in 1997, Amnesty International reported him to be under severe psychological stress as a result of his isolation. He also suffered from high blood pressure, kidney stones, and worsening eyesight throughout his jail term, worsened by a lack of medical attention and the conditions of his imprisonment. Following concerted international publicity pressure, Doan was released from prison and expelled from the country on 28 August 1998. The United States agreed to grant him citizenship, and seven days later, he rejoined his family at the Los Angeles International Airport, where he was greeted by a crowd of more than one hundred well-wishers. Awards Doan Viet Hoat has received numerous international awards for his activism, both during and following his imprisonment. In 1993, he won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The following year, the PEN American Center gave Doan the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award, which honors \\"writers who have fought courageously in the face of adversity for the right to freedom of expression\\". In 1995, Doan was awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, which he shared with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi. The World Association of Newspapers awarded him its Golden Pen of Freedom in 1998 for \\"outstanding contributions to the cause of press freedom\\", drawing criticism from the Vietnamese government, which called it \\"a mistake which would not be supported by public opinion in Vietnam.\\". In 2000, the International Press Institute named him one of its 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the 20th century. He currently holds the post of scholar-in- residence at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and continues to speak and write in favor of democratic reform in Vietnam.

Biography His father, K√°roly Klette, was a court painter and drawing instructor for Archduke Joseph.Biography and appreciation @ M≈±v√©szet. In 1861, when a Hungarian title of nobility was granted, the family name was changed to Kelety. Rather than follow his father's profession, Guszt√°v originally trained in Vienna to be a lawyer, although he also took lessons from Carl Rahl. Upon the recommendation of his professor, Tivadar Pauler, he became a tutor to Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s, the son of Baron J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s. That family's influence would later prove significant to his career. Soon, his law studies became secondary to his art studies and he spent some time at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, where he studied with Johann Fischbach, Friedrich Voltz and Eduard Schleich.Artportal: Brief biography. In 1871, Baron E√∂tv√∂s, who was then the Minister of Education, sent Kelety on a study tour to investigate how art instruction was conducted in other countries. He travelled to France, Belgium and Germany and produced a report titled The Function of Art Education in Our Country and Abroad, which recommended that a uniform system be established; including a \\"pre-art\\" school. The proposal was accepted and the \\"Hungarian Royal National School of Arts and Crafts\\" (now the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design) was launched in 1880. Kelety became the first Director. From the mid-1860s, he wrote art reviews of a mostly conservative nature, although he was among the first to notice the talents of many painters who later became well-known, such as Istv√°n Nagy, Tivadar Kosztka Csontv√°ry, Mih√°ly Munk√°csy and P√°l Szinyei Merse. In his later years, he became ill with tuberculosis and attempted suicide shortly before dying of the disease in 1902.

It was started in 1972 by Selma James who first put forward the demand for wages for housework at the third National Women‚Äôs Liberation Conference in Manchester, England. The IWFHC state that they begin with those with least power internationally ‚Äì unwaged workers in the home (mothers, housewives, domestic workers denied pay), and unwaged subsistence farmers and workers on the land and in the community. They consider the demand for wages for unwaged caring work to be also a perspective and a way of organizing from the bottom up, of autonomous sectors working together to end the power relations among them.  History  Wages for housework was one of the six demands in Women, the Unions and Work or What Is Not to Be Done, which James presented as a paper to the third National Women's Liberation Conference. The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community, which James co-authored with Mariarosa Dalla Costa, which opened the ‚Äúdomestic labour debate‚Äù and became a women‚Äôs movement classic, was published soon after Women, the Unions and Work. The first edition of Power of Women did not come out for wages for housework; its third edition, in 1975, did. After the Manchester conference, James with three or four other women formed the Power of Women Collective in London and Bristol to campaign for wages for housework. It was reconstituted as the Wages for Housework Campaign in 1975, based in London, Bristol, Cambridge and later Manchester. In 1974, the Wages for Housework Campaign started in Italy. A number of groups calling themselves Salario al Lavoro Domestico (Wages for Housework) formed in various Italian cities. To celebrate, one of the founding members Mariarosa Dalla Costa gave a speech entitled \\"A General Strike\\" in Mestre, Italy. In this speech she talks about how no strike before has ever been a general strike before, but instead, only a strike for male workers. In Padua, Italy, a group called Lotta Feminista, formed by Mariarosa Dalla Costa, and Silvia Federici, adopted Wages for Housework as their organising strategy.\\"More Smiles, More Money\\", N+1 Magazine, August 2013. Between 1974 and 76, three autonomous organizations formed within the Wages for Housework Campaign in the UK, US and Canada: Wages Due Lesbians (now Queer Strike), the English Collective of Prostitutes and Black Women for Wages for Housework, co-founded by Margaret Prescod (now Women of Colour in the Global Women‚Äôs Strike). Black Women for Wages for Housework focused on specific issues of Black and third world women, including calling for reparations for \\"slavery, imperialism and neo-colonialism,\\". Wages Due Lesbians called for wages for housework along with extra wages for lesbians for \\"the additional physical and emotional housework of surviving in a hostile and prejudiced society, recognized as work and paid for so all women have the economic power to afford sexual choices,\\". Wages Due Lesbians also worked alongside The Lesbian Mothers' National Defense Fund, founded in 1974 and based in Seattle, which aimed to help lesbian mothers who had to fight custody cases after coming out. In 1984 WinVisible (women with visible and invisible disabilities) was founded in the UK as an autonomous organisation within the IWFHC. In 1975 Silvia Federici started the New York group called the \\"Wages for Housework Committee\\" and opened an office in Brooklyn, New York at 288 B. 8th St. Flyers handed out in support of the New York Wages for Housework Committee called for all women to join regardless of marital status, nationality, sexual orientation, number of children, or employment. In 1975 Federici published Wages Against Housework. Men who agree with the WFH perspective formed their own organisation in the mid-70s. It is called Payday men's network and works closely with IWFHC and the Global Women's Strike in London and Philadelphia especially and is active with conscientious objectors and refuseniks in a number of countries. In 1977, two years after Black Women for Wages for Housework was formed in New York there was a split. The WFH group in New York which Silvia Federici had formed and which had been all white, refused to work with the Black women's group and dissolved. The Italian Padua group led by Dalla Costa, who was close to Federici, left the IWFHC and dissolved not long after. Dalla Costa has blamed the political repression in Italy in the late 70s for the dissolution of the Italian WFH groups. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the Italian WFH Campaign stopped being active towards the end of the 70s. Black Women for Wages for Housework carried on in New York and in London (a group had also started in Bristol in 1976, and later brances formed in Los Angeles and San Francisco). It had a major success at the first congressionally mandated women's conference in Houston, Texas, in 1977. Working with Beulah Sanders and Johnnie Tillmon, the Black women who led the National Welfare Rights Organization, they got the conference to agree that \\"welfare payments\\" should be called a \\"wage\\". They believe that this helped to delay welfare cuts by 20 years. IWFHC had an anti-war and anti- militarist perspective from the start, and called for the funds to pay for unwaged caring work to come from military budgets. In England the organization was part of the women's movement against nuclear weapons at Greenham Common and against the building of a new nuclear power reactor at Hinkley (publication Refusing Nuclear Housework). The U.S. PROStitutes Collective (US PROS) first started in New York in 1982 and later moved to San Francisco and Los Angeles. It campaigns for decriminalization of sex work and for resources so women, children and men are not forced into prostitution. Ruth Todasco, who started the Wages for Housework Campaign in Tulsa, later founded the No Bad Women, Just Bad Laws Coalition which focused on the decriminalization of sex work. Recent history Throughout the 80s and 90s, the IWFHC representing a number of countries of the Global South and Global North, lobbied the United Nations Conferences on Women on unwaged work. They succeeded in getting the UN to pass path-breaking resolutions that recognized the unwaged caring work that women do in the home, on the land and in the community. They also highlighted the environmental racism that fell on communities of colour and low-income communities generally, bringing together women from the Global South and the Global North who were leading movements against pollution and destruction caused by the military and multinationals. In 1999 the IWFHC called a global women‚Äôs strike after Irish women asked for support for a national strike in Ireland to mark the first International Women's Day of the new millennium. Since 8 March 2000, the IWFHC has become more widely known as the Global Women's Strike (GWS), which it co-ordinates from the Crossroads Women's Centre in London, England. There are GWS co-ordinations in India, Ireland, Peru, Thailand, Trinidad & Tobago, and close collaboration with Haiti and other countries. Silvia Federici and several others from the early campaign have continued to publish books and articles related to the demands of Wages for Housework. The Wages for Housework Campaign called for a Global Women‚Äôs Strike (GWS) on March 8, 2000, demanding among other things, \\"Payment for all caring work ‚Äì in wages, pensions, land and other resources.\\" Women from more than 60 countries around the world participated in the protest. Since 2000 the GWS network has continued the call for a living wage for women and other caregivers, and they have led or joined campaigns focused on pay equity, violence against women, and the rights of sex workers, among other issues. In 2019 the Global Women‚Äôs Strike (GWS) network and Wages for Housework Campaign joined a coalition of organizations calling for a Green New Deal for Europe (GNDE). Wages for Housework Campaign co-founder, Selma James (with other GWS members), contributed to the GNDE platform report which includes a policy recommendation to \\"fund a care income to compensate unpaid activities like care for people, the urban environment, and the natural world.\\" The idea of a \\"care income\\" expands the original demand for wages for housework to include all indispensable yet unpaid (or underpaid) work that involves caring for people and the planet, or caring for life. On 9 April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and the climate emergency, the Global Women‚Äôs Strike and Women of Colour GWS networks released an open letter to governments amplifying their call for a ‚Äúcare income.‚Äù IWFHC, and now the Global Women's Strike, present themselves as the collective endeavour of the autonomous organizations formed since 1974 and their campaigns. These campaigns include: ending poverty, welfare cuts, detention, deportation; a living wage/care income for mothers and other carers; domestic workers' rights'; pay equity; justice for survivors of rape and domestic violence; challenging racism, disability racism, queer discrimination, transphobia; decriminalizing sex work; stopping the state taking children from their mothers; opposing apartheid, war, genocide, military occupation, corporate land grabs; supporting human rights defenders and refuseniks; ending the death penalty and solitary confinement . . . . All are fighting for climate justice and survival. They describe anti-racism, anti-discrimination, and the justice work women do collectively for themselves and others as being at the heart of all their campaigning.  Controversies  Critics have argued that providing wages for housework could further reinforce or institutionalize specific gendered roles vis-√†-vis housework, and care work more broadly. Rather than providing wages for housework, they argue, the goal should be liberation from it and the demeaning and subordinating role of \\"housewife\\". Instead feminists should focus on increasing women‚Äôs opportunities in the paid workforce with pay equity, while promoting a more equal distribution of unpaid work in the household. Proponents of Wages for Housework also support equal opportunity and pay equity, however, they argue that entering the workforce does not sufficiently challenge the social role of women in the household nor result in a more equitable distribution of unpaid care work. In fact, more often than not, women who have entered the paid workforce often face a \\"double shift\\" of work, the first paid work in the labor market and the second unpaid housework. According to one global estimate, women spend 4.5 hours of unpaid work per day, twice as many hours as men do on average. Other criticisms include the concern that providing wages for housework would commodify intimate human relationships of love and care and would subsume them into capitalist relations. However, proponents of wages for housework contest this \\"reductive view\\" of their proposal. For instance, according to Silvia Federici the demand for wages for housework is not just about remuneration for unpaid work or women‚Äôs financial empowerment and independence. Rather, it is also a political perspective and a revolutionary strategy to make invisible work more visible, to demystify and disrupt the structural reliance of capitalism on the unpaid work of (mostly) women, and to subvert the supposed natural social role of \\"housewife\\" that capital has invented for women. What‚Äôs more, the payment of wages for housework would mean that capital would have to pay for the immense amount of unpaid care work (undertaken largely by women) that currently reproduces the labor force. According to a report by Oxfam and the Institute for Women‚Äôs Policy Research, the monetary value of unpaid care work is estimated at nearly $11 trillion a year. This amounts to an enormous subsidy to the capitalist economy, and paying for it would likely render the current system uneconomic, subverting the social relations in the process. Monetary estimates of this kind are used to demonstrate the scale of unpaid work in relation to more visible waged work. However, proponents of wages for housework do not advocate for the marketization and commodification of unpaid care work. Instead they have promoted public funding for these schemes as part of a larger project of recognizing and revaluing the indispensable role of unpaid care work for society and the economy. Some feminist scholars have also called for the creation of new commons-based systems of care and basic provisioning that operate outside of the market and state, and for the defense of existing commons, especially in communities of the Global South. Early influences A number of early feminists focused women's economic independence along with the role of housewife in relation to women's oppression. In 1898 Charlotte Perkins Gilman published Women and Economics. This book argued for paid housework 74 years before the International Wages for Housework Campaign was founded as well as arguing to expand the definition of women in the home. She asserts that \\"wives, as earners through domestic service, are entitled to the wages of cooks, housemaids, nursemaids, seamstresses, or housekeepers\\" and that providing women economic independence is key to their liberation. Alva Myrdal, a Swedish feminist, focused on state sponsored child care and housing, in order to ease the burden of parenting off mothers. In Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, in which de Beauvoir asserts that women cannot find transcendence through unpaid house work. This idea is echoed in The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan when she discusses how women are unable to feel fulfilled in the home. The Feminine Mystique defined many second-wave feminist goals, and the connection between the Wages for Housework Campaign and this work cannot be overlooked. In 1965 Alison Ravetz published \\"Modern Technology and an Ancient Occupation: Housework in Present-Day Society\\" which critiques housework being a womanly duty post-industrial revolution. The idea here is that since housework has become less labor intensive since then, it is even less fulfilling than ever before. This echos a similar argument made by Alva Myrdal. Perhaps the most important early influence for the modern Wages for Housework Campaign is the work of Eleanor Rathbone, the Independent feminist MP who campaigned for decades for mothers to have an independent income in recognition of their work bringing up children. She saw this as essential to end mothers' and children's poverty and their dependency on a male wage. She laid out her case in her 1924 publication, The Disinherited Family (republished by Falling Wall Press in 1986). Her 25-year-campaign in and out of Parliament won Family Allowance for all mothers in the UK, and was the first measure of the 1945 Welfare State.

It began serialization on January 30, 2012 as Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha (officially stylized as Weekly SHONEN JUMP Œ±lpha or Weekly SHONEN JUMP Alpha), with two free preview issues published in the buildup to its launch. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine of the same name, Weekly Shonen Jump was an attempt to provide English-speaking readers with easily accessible, affordable, and officially licensed editions of the latest installments of popular Sh≈çnen Jump manga soon after their publication in Japan, as an alternative to popular bootleg scanlation services. The anthology launched with a lineup of six titles, with new issues published online two weeks after the equivalent Japanese release. At the time of its cancellation, the magazine featured twelve titles, including installments of monthly series from the Japanese magazine's sister publications, Weekly Young Jump, Jump SQ, V Jump, and Young Jump Web Comics. At New York Comic-Con 2012 it was announced that the magazine would transition to simultaneous publication with Japan beginning with the January 21, 2013 issue, with more new series to be added to the lineup. The magazine was renamed Weekly Shonen Jump starting on January 21, 2013. Viz Media published its final digital issue of Weekly Shonen Jump and launched the Shonen Jump digital vault on December 10, 2018, providing access to a limited number of free digital chapters and a subscription service to access their back catalogue of Shonen Jump titles. A global version of Shonen Jump+ was also launched on January 28, 2019 called MANGA Plus by Shueisha. History In October 2011, Viz confirmed that Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha, a weekly digital version of the magazine, would be released on January 30, 2012. Viz also confirmed that it would release its final Shonen Jump print publication in March of that year after Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha is released. On January 11, 2012, two free preview issues were published, made available until February 29, 2012. The first, Issue Origins, included the first chapter of each of the six manga to be serialized, while Issue 0 included chapters recently released in Japan, to help readers catch-up. In Summer 2012, Bakuman became the first title of the original Alpha lineup to finish serialization, and the magazine began featuring installments of ongoing monthly titles from Jump SQ and V Jump, as well as a number of new series fresh from their debut in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, including Barrage, Cross Manage, and Takama-Ga-Hara. In October 2012, Viz released the first \\"Starter Pack,\\" a free, 300+ page preview containing recent chapters of all the titles currently serialized in the magazine. On January 21, 2013, the magazine was renamed Weekly Shonen Jump and began simultaneous publication with Japanese editions of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. The layout and graphic design of the magazine was changed, and a new website was launched at shonenjump.com. The transition also brought with it the announcement of several new series, including a full-color reprinting of Dragon Ball, the superhero webmanga One-Punch Man, and the debut of a new Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump sci-fi series, World Trigger. On July 4, 2013, the magazine went international, becoming available for purchase in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In January, 2014, Weekly Shonen Jump returned to print via the Jump Pack, a quarterly print sampler that includes a three-month subscription to the digital magazine and a promotional Yu-Gi-Oh! card. In August, 2014, a new \\"Jump Start\\" feature was announced, whereby all new series debuting in the Japanese edition of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump will have at their first three chapters published in the English Weekly Shonen Jump. A variety of factors including continued Japanese serialization and English audience reception will then help to determine if the series is picked up for full serialization in the English magazine. On June 29, 2016, the magazine expands its availability, becoming available for purchase in India, the Philippines and Singapore. On December 10, 2018, Viz Media published its final digital issue of Weekly Shonen Jump in favor of new chapters being released for free and a subscription service to access their back catalogue. Features Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha's first issue, published January 30, 2012 Issues of Weekly Shonen Jump ranged from 100 to 393 pages, depending on the titles and special features appearing in any given week, and were available to read online or on web-enabled devices via Viz's official website or through the official app. Readers could sign up for an annual subscription or purchase individual issues. The format of the magazine generally mirrored that of the equivalent issue of the Japanese magazine, typically featuring the same cover illustrations, as well as color interior pages and the ordering of series on the table of contents by popularity, as determined by weekly reader polls in Japan. Issues frequently contained additional features such as exclusive creator interviews and manga specials (including one-shots, crossovers, and full-color chapters). Likewise, the official website offered articles, wallpapers, chapter previews, sketch videos, and a variety of other special features. Annual subscribers who registered their mailing address would also periodically receive free promotional Yu-Gi-Oh! cards through the mail, as well as a free \\"yearbook\\" each December, which included exclusive one-shot manga specials, posters, interviews, and other features. Series Running in the magazine at the time of its cancellation Completed series Jump Start series Beginning in September 2014, the \\"Jump Start initiative\\" was started with the goal of previewing the first three issues of all new manga debuting in the Japanese magazine, with the potential for full serialization in the English magazine if various criteria are met.

The Biosecurity Act 2015 and related legislation is administered by the two departments. The Act aims to manage biosecurity risks to human health, agriculture, native flora and fauna and the environment. It also covers Australia's international rights and obligations, and lists specific diseases which are contagious and capable of causing severe harm to human health. Each state and territory has additional legislation and protocols to cover biosecurity in their jurisdiction, and must liaise with the federal government in times of national emergency. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity (IGAB) created a framework for governments to coordinate and identify priority areas of reform and action to build a stronger and more effective national biosecurity system, and establishesd the National Biosecurity Committee (NBC) in 2012. , the Department of Health has a page devoted to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is updated daily. Background The term ‚Äúbiosecurity‚Äù has in the past been used purely to describe preventive and quarantine measures put in place to minimise the risk of invasive pests or diseases arriving at a specific location that could damage crops and livestock as well as the wider environment. However, the term has evolved to encompass much more. It includes managing biological threats to people, industries or environment. These may be from foreign or endemic organisms, but they can also extend to pandemic diseases and the threat of bioterrorism. Biosecurity is also a process ‚Äì a set of linked science-based protocols and procedures designed to stop these unwanted pests and diseases from arriving in Australia, and detecting and rapidly eradicating them if they do arrive or trying to minimise their impact by using long-term management strategies, if they become established. Being an island, Australia is to some degree protected from exotic pests and diseases, but along with this it also has an enormous border (the coastline) to protect, with the sixth longest coastline in the world, at . With the increase in international trade up until the second decade of the 21st century, ships, planes and people have been moving in increasing numbers across international and state borders. History of governance Legislation In 2015, the Biosecurity Act 2015 replaced most of the Quarantine Act 1908, which was wholly repealed on 16 June 2016 by the Biosecurity (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2015. The new Act was a major reform of the Quarantine Act, in particular in its strengthening and modernising the existing framework of regulations governing biosecurity in Australia. New requirements included how the then Department of Agriculture and Water Resources would manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, people and vessels entering Australia. The Biosecurity Bill 2014 passed through parliament on 14 May 2015 with bipartisan support, as possibly \\"one of the most substantial and significant pieces of legislation to pass through Parliament during the term of the [Abbott] Government\\". The Act did not radically change operational functions, but were more clearly described, with the aim of being easier to use and reducing the complexity of administering it. The main change relate was the compliance and enforcement of powers. As recommended by the Beale Review (One Biosecurity: A Working Partnership, Roger Beale et al., 2008 Full text here) and the earlier Nairn Report, the Act effected a risk-based approach, but includes several measures to manage unacceptable levels of biosecurity risk. Administration From August 2007 until September 2009, Biosecurity Australia, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, provided science-based quarantine assessments and policy advice to protect plant and animal health in Australia, in order to protect the Australian agricultural economy and to enhance Australia's access to international animal- and plant-related markets. Import risk assessments (IRAs) by Biosecurity Australia included a variety of flora and fauna. In September 2009, a division of DAFF known as Biosecurity Services Group took over its functions. DAFF became the Department of Agriculture in September 2013, followed by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in September 2015, and then the Department of Agriculture (Australia, 2019‚Äì20), each of which was responsible for biosecurity. Current federal governance , biosecurity in Australia is governed and administered by two federal departments, the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. They administer and enforce the various pieces of legislation in the Biosecurity Act 2015 and related ordinances, determinations and instruments. The federal government has to coordinate with state governments in case of a nationwide biosecurity emergency, such as that brought by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Health The department of Health defines biosecurity as \\"all the measures taken to minimise the risk of infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria or other micro-organisms entering, emerging, establishing or spreading in Australia, potentially harming the Australian population, our food security and economy\\". These risks may enter Australia after people enter the countries from other places (whether on holiday or any other reason), having developed infections through food, water, insect bites, or contact with animals or other people. Often the infection is unknown because it is not obvious, and the infected person is not aware of it themselves, until they become unwell some time later. Some of these diseases may be serious, and biosecurity measures are necessary to ensure that the infection does not spread throughout the population. The Act lists specific diseases (Listed Human Diseases, or LHDs) which are contagious and can cause significant harm to human health; , these LHDs include: *human influenza with pandemic potential *plague *severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) *Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) *smallpox *viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHDs) *yellow fever *human coronavirus with pandemic potential Biosecurity Officers from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment must be informed by any aircraft captain or ship's master, should any of their passengers show signs of an infectious disease. Human biosecurity in Australia covers protective measures enforced at the border, travel information and warnings, the import and export of human remains, national public health emergency response planning at the borders and Australia's international obligations, in particular the International Health Regulations (IHR). A Joint External Evaluation (JEE) e following the 2013‚Äì2016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic showed that Australia has very high level of capacity of response. Australia‚Äôs National Action Plan for Health Security 2019-2023 was developed to help to implement the recommendations from the JEE. National Action Plan for Health Security 2019-2023, December 2018 Management of ill travellers is one aspect of human biosecurity management; prevention of potential disease vectors (such as exotic mosquitoes) is another. Agriculture Animals Animal biosecurity involves protecting Australian livestock industries, native wildlife, human health and the environment from exotic or emerging animal pests and diseases. Australia is free of many highly infectious animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza (bird flu), African swine fever and many others. An outbreak of any of these diseases could significantly impact the productivity of livestock industries, and make it very difficult to trade agricultural products overseas, as well as resulting in significant social and economic costs. The 2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak showed just how disruptive such disease outbreaks can be. Avian influenza was detected on poultry farms in New South Wales, followed by widespread culling, causing widespread disruption to the industry. Strict farm level biosecurity is becoming increasingly the norm. Emerging infectious diseases in livestock often originate in wild, native species, and these diseases may also affect human health ‚Äì so-called zoonotic diseases comprised about 70% of all emerging diseases affecting human populations in 2013. These included bird flu, avian influenza, SARS and Hendra virus. The impacts of these diseases can be extremely severe, hence the need to manage livestock and human health risks in a unified way. Plants Plant pests and diseases can damage plant industries, by reducing yields, lowering the quality of food, increasing production costs, and reducing the viability of sales to international markets. They have enormous potential for damage in the huge expanses of the wheat industry, as well as in the more intensive high-value production of horticulture, wine, cotton and sugar industries. Fewer pest and disease problems mean lower production costs. Plant pests and diseases can also cause significant damage to the natural environment. Australia is free of many damaging pests prevalent elsewhere, such as citrus greening, varroa mite (which has devastated honeybee productivity in every continent except Australia). Food safety The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is also responsible for food safety in Australia. It works with industry and other government agencies, in particular the Department of Health, and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), to develop policy and food standards, and the regulatory system involves the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the Australian states and territories. The Department administers relevant legislation at the Australian border, and imported food must meet Australia's biosecurity requirements under the Biosecurity Act 2015, as well as food safety requirements of the Imported Food Control Act 1992. Agricultural and environmental biosecurity coordination Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity (IGAB) The Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity (IGAB) was created in January 2012. It was an agreement between the federal, state and territory governments, with the exception of Tasmania, intended to \\"improve the national biosecurity system by identifying the roles and responsibilities of governments and outline the priority areas for collaboration to minimise the impact of pests and disease on Australia‚Äôs economy, environment and the community\\". It was focussed on controlling animal and plant pests rather than human biosecurity, as it was considered that this aspect was already covered by existing agreements, and set out to improve collaboration and understanding of shared responsibilities among all parties, including industry stakeholders. The 2012 IGAB created a framework for governments to coordinate and identify priority areas of reform and action to build a stronger and more effective national biosecurity system. The agreement comprised two parts: the first part established the goal, objectives and principles of the system, as well as the purpose and scope of the agreement; the second part, the schedules, outlined the priority work areas for governments and their key decision-making committee, the NBC (National Biosecurity Committee). The work based on IGAB led to the development of significant and sound national policy principles and frameworks, including the National Environmental Biosecurity Response Agreement (NEBRA). 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. 2017 review An independent review of Australia's biosecurity system and the underpinning IGAB undertaken in 2017, resulting in the Priorities for Australia‚Äôs biosecurity system report, noted that the \\"application of shared responsibility for biosecurity is difficult and challenging,... primarily because the roles and responsibilities of participants across the national biosecurity system are not clearly understood, accepted, or consistently recognised across the system by all involved\\". The review examined many aspects of the existing system. Excluded from the review were: * biosecurity arrangements specific to human health; * biosecurity Import Risk Analyses (BIRAs); * comprehensive reviews of emergency responses deeds; * response plans, such as the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN); *matters to do with specific biosecurity legislation; and * matters to do with Australia‚Äôs international obligations relating to biosecurity. It explicitly states that its recommendations were not intended to change or impact on human health arrangements in the health department or between the departments of agriculture and health. The report, under a section titled \\"Market Access is key\\", said that Australia‚Äôs world class biosecurity system is a trade and economic asset, but that there was scope for improvement. The report named a number of challenges and topics needing future focus, such as environmental biosecurity (which includes both natural ecosystems and social amenities), which has been viewed as subordinate to agricultural biosecurity in the national biosecurity system, and thus received less funding. Among its recommendations was the appointment of a new position of Chief Community and Environmental Biosecurity Officer (CCEBO) within the environment department, to perform a national policy leadership role similar to the Chief Veterinary Officer and Chief Plant Protection Officer in the national biosecurity system. The report stated that Australia has a mixture of biosecurity strategies and policies that have been tailor-made for each jurisdiction, taxon and/or agency, and that an agreed national approach for prioritising exotic pest and disease risks is desirable, to guide governments‚Äô investments. In the area of research, it concluded that the system \\"no longer [had] the required structure, focus or capacity to address existing and emerging national biosecurity challenges\\" with \\"many players but no captain\\". It recommended several steps for improved governance, including that the NBC should improve its transparency and accountability, including making more information publicly available\\". In all, it published 41 recommendations to improve Australia's biosecurity system. Managing biosecurity risk has become more challenging due to increasing risks, the changing nature of risks, and increases in associated management costs. Factors such as globalisation, international and interstate migration, climate change, tourism, and the increasing movement of goods are all contributing to increases in biosecurity risks. While the IGAB and NBC had been pivotal in fostering improved government collaboration, there was room for the NBC to improve its transparency and accountability, making more information publicly available. The IGAB had provided a strong mandate for advancing national biosecurity capacity and capability, which critically impacts whole-of economy and whole- of-government arrangements, affecting trade and market access, tourism, agricultural productivity, human health, environmental quality, biodiversity and social amenity. The report considered future challenges, funding measures, governance and performance measurement, listed 42 recommendations, and outlined an implementation pathway for its recommendations, and the potential features of a future system. In June 2018, the role of Chief Environmental Biosecurity Officer (CEBO) was created to oversee environmental biosecurity, with Ian Thompson appointed to the role. IGAB2 A second agreement was effected in January 2019, known as IGAB2, with all states and governments as signatories, following the review. National Biosecurity Committee (NBC) The National Biosecurity Committee (NBC) was established under the IGAB in 2012. The NBC is \\"responsible for managing a national, strategic approach to biosecurity threats relating to plant and animal pests and diseases, marine pests and aquatics, and the impact of these on agricultural production, the environment, community well-being and social amenity\\", with one of its core objectives being to cooperation, coordination and consistency among the various government agencies involved. The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (Andrew Metcalfe ) chairs the NBC and up to two senior officials from the federal, state and territory primary industry and/or environment agencies and jurisdictions. It provides advice on national biosecurity matters, and provides updates on progress towards implementing the recommendations of the 2017 Review to the Agriculture Senior Officials Committee. State-based agencies and legislation Summary of state-based legislation , the NSW, WA, Queensland and Tasmanian Governments have developed and passed consolidated Biosecurity Acts. The Australian Capital Territory Government has developed a framework for a new Act, which will closely align with the New South Wales legislation. The Government of South Australia is in the process of developing a new Act. ACT The Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate of the Australian Capital Territory is responsible for biosecurity. , two Acts provide the mechanisms \\"to protect the health and welfare of people and animals and to protect markets relating to animals and plants and associated products\\": the Animal Diseases Act 2005 and the Plant Diseases Act 2002, while the Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005 protects land and aquatic resources from threats posed by from animal and plant pests in the ACT. Between 2017 and 2019, consultation took place on proposals for a new ACT Biosecurity Act, to manage biosecurity as a shared responsibility consistent with approaches taken by the other states and the Commonwealth. New South Wales *The NSW Department of Primary Industries is the primary agency responsible for biosecurity in the state, executing its functions under the Biosecurity Act 2015 No 24 (NSW), which came into effect on 1 June 2017. In addition, the Public Health Act 2010 was amended in September 2017 to expand the scope of public health orders relating to relate to a few very serious notifiable (Category 4 and 5) conditions, such as MERS or Ebola, to enable people to be detained as a public health risk, where they do not cooperate with voluntary quarantine. The changes were made to bring the Public Health Act into line with the federal Biosecurity Act 2015. **During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, a serious breach of biosecurity occurred when the cruise ship Ruby Princess was allowed to dock and its 2,777 passengers to disembark, despite some passengers having been diagnosed with COVID-19, with serious consequences. Australian Border Force is responsible for passport control and customs, while the federal Department of Agriculture is responsible for biosecurity; however, it is up to each state's health department to prevent illness in the community. Responsibility for the breakdown in communications will be determined by a later enquiry. Queensland *Biosecurity Queensland, which is part of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, is responsible for biosecurity in the state. The state's Biosecurity Act 2014 and the Queensland Biosecurity Strategy 2018-2023 govern and guide the Department's responsibilities with regard to biosecurity in Queensland. *Queensland Health liaises with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in biosecurity matters which relate to public health (whether by human or animal transmission, for example diphtheria), issues health alerts to the public and provides advice regarding travel and other restrictions on residents' activities relating to biosecurity risk. Northern Territory *The Department of Primary Industry and Resources and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources are responsible for biosecurity in the Northern Territory of Australia. Banana freckle disease, Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, browsing ant (Lepisiota frauenfeldi) and Asian honey bee have been recent threats to agriculture and the environment. The Northern Territory Biosecurity Strategy 2016-2026 was developed in order to address increasing biosecurity risks. PDF South Australia *Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA) manages manages the risks related to animal and plant pests and diseases, food-borne illnesses, and misuse of rural chemicals in South Australia. , PIRSA is managing a review of current biosecurity legislation in South Australia, which has been covered by multiple pieces of legislation, with the aim of creating a new single and cohesive Biosecurity Act for the state>> based on the current policy developed by PIRSA.> The discussion paper was published in 2019.New legislation for South Australia‚Äôs Biosecurity: Directions Paper‚ÄìFor consultation *SA Health, \\"the brand name for the health portfolio of services and agencies responsible to...the Minister for Health and Wellbeing\\", says that Biosecurity SA, under PIRSA, is responsible for managing the \\"risks and potential harm to the South Australian community, environment, and economy from pests and diseases\\". It cites a partnership known as \\"One Health\\", supported by the Zoonoses Working Group, which supports collaboration and coordination among stakeholders with regard to human, animal and environmental health. Tasmania *The island state of Tasmania has extremely stringent biosecurity requirements. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) is the parent department of the Biosecurity Tasmania agency. Tasmania's Biosecurity Act 2019 (assented to 26 August 2019) replaced seven separate Acts, whose regulations are still being applied until full implementation of the Act, expected around 2023. One of the key products of the Act was the creation of the Biosecurity Advisory Committee. Victoria *Agriculture Victoria, an agency of Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions (DJPR) is responsible for managing biosecurity in Victoria. The Executive Director, Biosecurity Services is in charge of biosecurity. Organisational chart, DJPR, 20 January 2020 The Victorian Chief Plant Health Officer Unit (CPHO), who exercises powers provided by the Plant Biosecurity Act 2010 and Plant Biosecurity Regulations 2016, is the technical lead on plant health management in Victoria. *Victoria's Chief Health Officer is also Chief Human Biosecurity Officer for Victoria. Western Australia *The Biosecurity Council of Western Australia was established on 27 February 2008 as a specialist advisory group to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Director-General of the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, under the Biosecurity and Agriculture Management Act 2007 (BAM Act). The Biosecurity and Agriculture Management Regulations 2013 support the Act. The BAM Act replaced 16 older Acts and 27 sets of regulations with one Act and nine sets of regulations. *Within the Department of Health, the State Health Coordinator and State Human Epidemic Controller form part of the Hazard Management Structure created by the State Emergency Management Committee (SEMC), which was established by the Emergency Management Act 2005 (EM Act). The State Hazard Plan was created in 2019. CSIRO The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the government agency responsible for scientific research, collaborates with the relevant government departments, as well as industry, universities and other international agencies, to help protect Australian people, livestock, plants and the environment. In 2014, CSIRO produced an 87-page document titled Australia's Biosecurity Future: Preparing for Future Biological Challenges. Past and present threats 2020: Coronavirus On 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, after the National Security Committee met the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that \\"a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale\\". This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Act only allows for three months, but may be extended for a further three if the Governor-General is satisfied that it is required. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day, forbids international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020. On 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which \\"forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger\\". On 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements‚ÄîPublic Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is \\"to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe\\", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19. , the (federal) Department of Health has a page devoted to the pandemic, which is updated daily. The state and territory governments used existing legislation relating to public health emergencies in order to bring in various measures in March. *In South Australia, a public health emergency was declared on 15 March 2020, under Section 87 of the Public Health Act 2011 (SA). SA Health is responsible for the provision, maintenance and coordination of health services under the Emergency Management Act 2004 the State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP). A dedicated web page to provide information for the community and health professionals was created, with linked pages to key information updated daily. On 27 March 2020, using the Emergency Management Act 2004, the State Coordinator, Commissioner of South Australia Police Grant Stevens, made a direction to prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people, and with a limit of one person per 4 square metres. *In Victoria, a state of emergency was declared on 16 March under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic), allowing health officials to \\"detain people, search premises without a warrant, and force people or areas into lockdown if it is considered necessary to protect public health\\". The state of emergency was for four weeks to 13 April, and on 12 April was extended by four weeks to 11 May. *On 18 March 2020, New South Wales used Section 7 of their Public Health Act 2010 to require the immediate cancellation of major events with more than 500 people outdoors, and more than 100 people indoors. NSW Health has a page dedicated to COVID-19.

The Trust offers guidance and advice relating to planning, heritage, regeneration and development, architecture and design which concern theatres. The Trust's remit covers a wide range of buildings which include theatres, old and new, in current use, in other uses, or disused.

The Trust is governed by fifteen trustees who are appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.\\"Official notification regarding the appointment of new Theatres Trust members\\". Department of Culture, Media & Sport These Trustees are appointed due to their expertise in a wide range of differing areas including theatre management, planning law and the performing arts (who include Penelope Keith and Dara √ì Briain). The Chairman of the Trust is currently Tim Eyles. Paragraph 1A of the Schedule to the Theatres Trust Act 1976 requires that \\"one of the trustees shall be a person who appears to the Secretary of State to have special knowledge of Scotland\\".

Funding The Theatres Trust owns the freeholds of The Garrick, Lyceum and Lyric Theatres in London and this is the principal source of its income base. These freeholds were transferred to the Trust by the London Residuary Body, following the abolition of the Greater London Council, to protect and ensure the continued operation of the theatres.\\"Transcript of parliamentary debate discussing the transference of the Garrick, Lyric & Lyceum Theatres to the Theatres Trust\\".

The wilderness area was created on March 30, 2009, when the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 was signed into law. This area is home to the largest old growth red fir forest in the region. Topography The Owens River Headwaters Wilderness is bounded on the west by the San Joaquin Ridge and the north by the June Mountain Ski Area. This area receives more moisture than average for the east side of the Sierra Nevada due to the relatively low elevation of the mountain ridge to the west. These conditions have allowed for the growth of heavily forested ridges and wet alpine meadows that are more typically seen on the west side of the Sierra Nevada. Notable features within the wilderness area include over 100 natural springs and seeps, and Glass Creek Meadow, the largest subalpine meadows in the central eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Wildlife The Owens River Headwaters are an important point on the migration route of many animals, including mule deer, pine marten and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. Glass Creek Meadow is home to a population of the endangered Yosemite toad and a large diversity of butterflies. The Owens River is home to several species of trout. Archeology Glass Creek, a tributary of the Owens River, was a source of obsidian for Native American tribes. Evidence of Native American habitation in this area dates back approximately 10,000 years. Recreation The Owens River Headwaters Wilderness is a popular destination for birdwatching and hiking. The area was popular for off road vehicle use, but after the area's designation as a protected wilderness, such activities have been severally curtailed. The Upper Owens River area is a popular location for fly fishing and hosts a large population of brown trout and rainbow trout. The Owens River Headwaters Wilderness is also a popular destination for nudists, who use the location for volleyball and cookouts.

The campaign of \\"Vote for Jenelle\\" went international after AfterEllen.com published an article about Hutcherson in September 2011.  Biography  Hutcherson is of Native-American, Mexican, Spanish, and Tennessean descent. She grew up in Wasco, CA where her father and mother owned their own business (Golden Empire Fire Protection). She attended grade school in the public school system and at middle school transitioned over to a private school of Christian organization. At 10 years old her father died of AIDS. He did not contract the disease the way most assumed at that time out of ignorance, but rather from the dentist office. Shortly after his death, her mother moved both her and her brother to Bakersfield, CA. There she raised sheep and horses with her family in the local 4-H Club. In middle school, Jenelle was bullied for having gained quite a bit of weight and could not afford name brand clothing classmates wore. Her mother, being the sole provider of the family, did what she could to continue to have a balanced family life at home for both her and her brother. In high school, at age 16 she came out, she knew that she was gay and had known since she was 5 years old. In high school, she was treated hastily for letting her sexuality and who she was be known, as well as for standing up for herself. Her mother questioned things of why she felt this way and even suggested counseling (although she would be a great source of support for Jenelle). Her grandmother was a hairstylist and inspired her to go to school to earn a cosmetology license. She then assisted a well-known artist in the area at Afif Hair International for four years. In beauty school, she was faced with more adversity, as she was scrutinized by the owner for being openly gay and even was told that she would never make it as a hairstylist by one of the instructors. Through all of the time of being treated unfairly, Jenelle admits she grew angry and hateful towards everyone and herself. She admits to having allowed herself to become exactly what these people were to her when she was younger, a bully. This attitude led to dependency on hurting others, and loss of self-respect, which led to drugs and alcohol. Jenelle has stated, \\"There comes a point in all of our lives that we must take responsibility for who we are and the energy we put out in the world.\\" This was her turning point, to quit living her life as an adult bully and use her energy God gave her for good; to help, not to hurt and spread hate. A saying her mother would always tell her resonated with her at this time: \\"You have the choice to use your power for good or not good.\\" She relocated to Long Beach in 2008 to work in downtown for The Den Salon. She was successful in building a large clientele within her first year and helped to build the business from the ground up alongside the salon owners, Andrew and Allison Kripp. The Den Salon took her in under their wing and helped her to grow as an artist and as an individual. Now working as the Den Salon's Lead Artist, the salon and staff have become like family. Together, as a tight-knit team of amazing artists and as a strong business in downtown, they tackle the challenge to do their part to help build a network of \\"fresh face\\" local businesses within the Downtown Long Beach area led by the Downtown Long Beach Association (DLBA). In October 2010, while working at The Den Salon, just 2 weeks before the 2011 title would be given to Monique Villa, Justin Rudd, the director of Miss Long Beach and Southern California Cities Pageant, and Jenelle had an epic conversation that would forever change the way the world looks at pageants, women, the LGBT community and Long Beach. Rudd asked Hutcherson if she would be interested in entering the Miss Long Beach pageant. She said that there was only one way she would be a part of such an event and that was as herself. Justin and Jenelle discussed wardrobe, (tuxedo and swimwear), and as a result it was decided that she could not do this until the next year (November 2011 for 2012 title) being that it would be different from what many originally signed up for and that it would change the pageant world in Long Beach and soon California. As a mentor for the Mentoring Youth Through Empowerment (MYTE) program for ages 13‚Äì18 at the Center of Downtown Long Beach, and standing for all of the bullying and the under-lying negative attitude toward the gay community, Jenelle was ready to take a stand in the pageant world. Being very sure of who she was,J enelle hoped to set an example and make people more aware of who they are. Especially those opposed and uneducated about LGBT youth and the community. Her work and vision has since inspired many, and her story of entering the pageant world with a real purpose has reached around the world. After pioneering and seeing the response, Jenelle just had to enter the Miss California USA 2012 pageant in order to reach more people. \\"To open at least one adult's mind or give one child hope. To teach more about Love and less about Hate. To overall inspire and create.\\" These were words that would echo throughout the community. Now as a mentor at the LGBTQ Center of downtown Long Beach MYTE Program, a well-known hair artist specializing in Three-Dimensional haircut/color, a designer for her own tuxedo line and swimwear line, a Scholarship for Tuxedos program in her name, and a pioneer as being the first openly gay pageant participant in local and state history (Miss Long Beach Nov.2011/Miss California USA Jan. 2012) she has succeeded in overcoming the obstacles she has faced, as well as becoming a good example to youth.

He is currently under contract with the Norfolk Admirals of the ECHL. Playing career Prior to turning professional, Selleck attended the State University of New York at Oswego where he played two seasons of NCAA Division III college hockey. On April 21, 2010, the Florida Panthers signed Selleck as a free agent to a two-way, two-year entry level contract. During the midpoint of the lockout shortened 2012‚Äì13 season, Selleck received his first NHL recall from the Panthers on March 19, 2013. He would be ejected from the game in the third period for instigating a fight with Hurricanes forward Kevin Westgarth. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, on March 2, 2014, Selleck was traded to the St. Louis Blues in return for Mark Mancari. As a free agent and unable to attain a NHL contract, Selleck signed a one-year AHL contract with the Portland Pirates, an affiliate of the Arizona Coyotes, on August 19, 2014. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Selleck enjoyed his best season as a professional, recording a career high 23 points in 74 games with the Pirates. On July 3, 2015, Selleck remained within the Coyotes organization, signing as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with Arizona. At the completion of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Selleck was again out of contract with the Coyotes. On August 5, 2016, Selleck signed a one-year AHL contract with the Coyotes new affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Selleck dropped his production offensively, falling to 5 goals and 9 points in 46 games. As a free agent from the Roadrunners in the following off-season, Selleck continued in the AHL by agreeing to a one-year deal with the Hartford Wolf Pack on July 28, 2017. In the 2017‚Äì18 season, Selleck in a depth role struggled to find his scoring touch with the Wolf Pack, registering 3 goals in 32 games. On February 22, 2018, Selleck was traded by the Wolf Pack to the Belleville Senators for future considerations. Following two seasons abroad in Slovakia with HC '05 Bansk√° Bystrica of the Tipsport Extraliga (Slovak) and lower tiered club, Bratislava Capitals, Selleck opted to return to North America agreeing to extend his professional career in the ECHL with the Norfolk Admirals on September 15, 2020.

The company's origins date to 1939 when a factory was established in Liezen for war materials production. Post WWII the company \\"H√ºtte Liezen\\" entered state control and became a subsidiary to V√ñEST in the 1950s. During the 1980s the company was involved in the 'Noricom' arms scandal due to its production of heavy artillery which were illegally exported. After independence from VOEST in the 1980s and bankruptcy in the 1990s the company was restarted as Maschinenfabrik Liezen und Gie√üerei Ges.m.b.H. in 1994. As of 2012 the company has extensive mechanical engineering facilities and foundry, and manufactures industrial milling and sawing machines. Several associate companies acquired after 1994 manufacture mineral processing equipment. History Background ‚Äì H√ºtte Liezen Iron ore deposits close to Liezen had been known to exist since the 1200s; mining and smelting took place in the Liezen area till the end of the 19th century. In 1939, the family of industrialists Schmid-Schmidsfelden created a works in Liezen; this was for the war effort and was not intended to be a post-war commercial business. By 1944, 1100 people were working at the plant. In May 1945, the American Allied army had reached Liezen and the plant was closed.Sources: * , alternative HTML link, from \\"Die H√ºtte Liezen\\" by Rolf Schretthauser * In 1945 the facilities included a steelworks and foundry building of over and another building of over with metal treatment (cleaning, annealing etc.) and mechanical engineering facilities, as well as various outbuildings, offices and power generation facilities. The plant was nationalised in 1946, becoming H√ºtte Liezen GesmbH, with a workforce reduced to 350. By the 1950s, employment had risen to nearly 1000 workers; in 1953 due to a difficult economic environment the plant was transferred under lease to the care of V√ñEST of Linz for 15 years - the plant's name became V√ñEST-Liezen - production synergies between the two plants were optimised - with the Liezen works receiving steel from V√ñEST's Linz plant. In 1963, the workforce was approximately 1300. When V√ñEST became V√ñEST-Alpine in 1973, the factory became V√ñEST-Alpine AG-Werk Liezen. Around that time, the plant's equipment was modernised at a cost of approximately Schilling 350 million. ;Noricum Maschinenbau und Handel (1987-9) In 1986 the company was renamed Noricum Maschinenbau und Handels-GmbH; , from Festschrift \\"70 Jahre Werk Liezen 1939 - 2009\\" by Karl H√∂dl During this period it became the centre of arms-export scandal - the Noricum Scandal; the plant had manufactured the GC-45 howitzer, which was then exported to Iraq and Iran via proxies (at the time of the Iran- Iraq war) - this was in violation of Austria's own arms treaties, and arms export treaties. It ultimately led to the trial and convictions of government officials and politicians for violations of Austria's neutrality act, in addition to others convicted of arms dealing. Maschinenfabrik Liezen In October 1989 the company became an independent entity as Maschinenfabrik Liezen AG, and was sold for the token sum of 1 Schilling to industrialist Emmerich Assmann. The Assmann group became bankrupt in 1993 and after a brief interim ownership by 1994 the Maschinenfabrik Liezen was itself insolvent and was eventually sold to the Haider Group. Maschinenfabrik Liezen und Gie√üerei After insolvency proceedings the company was restarted as Maschinenfabrik Liezen und Gie√üerei Ges.m.b.H. on 5 December 1994. In 1996 the mineral processing company (grinding mills and components) Christian Pfeifer Maschinenfabrik was taken over. In 2004 the company MFL Faserzementanlagen Ges.m.b.H. (Fibre cement manufacturing equipment manufacturer) was formed from the assets of VOITH-FCM; Maschinenfabrik Liezen and ICS - Automation of Switzerland are backers of the company. In August 2011 the mineral processing (crushing/sorting etc.) company SBM Mineral Processing GmbH of Laakirchen was taken over by MFL's owner 'Group Haider' (Heinrich Obernhuber / Kr√ºnes Consulting GmbH.) becoming an associate company of the MFL group. A rail milling and grinding joint venture Vossloh MFL Rail Milling GmbH, was formed in association with Vossloh AG in 2012. Products and services The company manufactures machines for mineral processing including crushing and sorting equipment (in addition to products by associates 'Christian Pfeifer Maschinenfabrik' and 'SBM Mineral Processing'), industrial saws and milling machines, and cable stranding machines (through MFL group associate MALI GesmbH). . The foundry also produces iron and alloy castings.

The Ashram and feeding center started by him in Gariadhar, is still doing their service to humanity. Hundreds of people, from various places, visit ashram & samadhi to pay their respects to the departed saint. Recently, in January, 2012, more than 150 years old four antique metal idols of Sri Krishna of religious significance, were stolen from Ashram. The idols were stolen by breaking the locks of the gate of temple inside the ashram. As per information given by presiding Mahant of Ashram, there is a folk-tale that two of the idols were said to have been presented to Valamramji by Lord Krishna, when he gave darshan to him. These idols were installed in temple inside ashram by the saint Valamramji himself. Other two idols were installed by Mahantas, who succeeded the ashram's gadi, after demise of saint Shri Valamram Bapu. Gujarat Samachar Online - 8 Jan 2012 However, after one day the idols were found lying inside a bag, left at the gate of Ashram. The two metal idols were found broken and two intact. There was a sense of relief and rejoice in the city after news of recovery of idols were announced by police. A procession was taken out, thereafter, by followers of Valamram Bapa & citizens to celebrate recovery of idols.

Design and development At the end of World War II, Ingalls Shipbuilding, based in Pascagoula, Mississippi, developed plans for a line of diesel-electric locomotives to serve the expected post-war market.

The lack of orders combined with issues with the supply of components for the locomotive resulted in Ingalls electing to abandon its plans for locomotive construction; the sole 4-S would be the only locomotive ever to be built by the company. It was sold to the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad for US$140,000, where it received the road number 1900. The 4-S served with the GM&O;, operating primarily from Mobile, Alabama, earning a reputation for toughness; it once derailed, landing inverted, but was repaired and returned to service in short order. In 1966, the locomotive was traded in to EMD by the railroad as partial payment for new locomotives; the engine was offered to the Illinois Railway Museum for US$3,000, but the museum was unable to raise the necessary funds. When no other buyers materialized, the locomotive was sold to Pielet Brothers in 1967, where it was scrapped.

Sketch by his student Christian Wilhelm Allers Ferdinand Keller, or von Keller (5 August 1842 ‚Äì 8 July 1922) was a German genre and history painter.  Life  He was born in Karlsruhe to the family of a civil engineer. In 1857, when he was fifteen, his father was awarded a contract to design bridges, roads and dams in Brazil. Ferdinand and his brother Franz were able to accompany him. Over the course of a four-year stay, he was able to teach himself drawing by sketching the tropical landscape. Shortly after their return, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, where he studied with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, the former Director of the Academy.Stadtwiki Karlsruhe: Biography After Schirmer's death, he studied with Ludwig des Coudres. He was unsatisfied with the Academy, however, and took private lessons in the studio of Hans Canon. This was followed, in 1866 and 1867, by study trips to Switzerland and France. He achieved his first recognition with his painting \\"The Death of Philip II\\" at the International Exposition. From 1867 to 1869, he lived in Rome, where he made the acquaintance of Anselm Feuerbach and maintained a joint studio with him. In 1870, he became a teacher of portrait and history painting at the Karlsruhe Academy and was appointed a Professor in 1873. From 1880 to 1913, he served as Director. In addition to his regular paintings, he provided decorations and curtains for the new Karlsruhe Court Theater and the Dresden Semperoper. His decorations for the King Carl Hall at the Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg pleased the King so much that he awarded Keller a title of nobility. Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, commissioned him to paint the \\"History of Baden\\", now on display at the . On a smaller scale, his etchings have been used to illustrate numerous books. He died in 1922 in Baden-Baden.

This season features Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove), Sam Puckett (Jennette McCurdy), Freddie Benson (Nathan Kress) and Gibby Gibson (Noah Munck) as their web show, iCarly, is becoming more popular worldwide, with Sam and Freddie now as a confirmed couple, until the episode, \\"iLove You\\". Jerry Trainor co-stars as Carly's older brother Spencer, and Noah Munck co-stars as Gibby. This season had the specials \\"iLost My Mind\\", \\"iDate Sam & Freddie\\", \\"iBloop 2: Electric Bloopaloo\\", \\"iStill Psycho, and \\"iMeet the First Lady\\". Season synopsis Following the events of \\"iOMG\\", where Sam kisses Freddie, she disappears for three days. Carly's knowledge of Sam's cell-phone password and the use of cell-phone-tracking software reveal that Sam has checked herself into a mental hospital. Freddie visits her to find out that she cannot handle her mixed feelings of love and hate for him. Freddie, on an iCarly webcast live from the mental institution, reveals that even though Sam likes him and is in denial about it, his feelings are important, too. He walks up to her and kisses her, symbolizing the start of a new relationship. In the next few episodes (\\"iLost My Mind\\", \\"iDate Sam & Freddie\\", \\"iCan't Take It\\", and \\"iLove You\\"), the Sam and Freddie relationship is growing. Sam and Freddie are a couple but they keep fighting and after solving one problem, Carly ends up being their involuntary 'couple's counselor'. This starts driving Carly mad when Sam and Freddie end up going to Carly at 3:00AM for a stupid fight. Carly then ends up being dragged into a dinner date with Sam and Freddie but gets really upset when she has to sit at a table by herself. After a second fight between the two, Carly loses it and tells off the couple for being unable to work out their own problems and goes home, leaving Sam and Freddie confused. In the next episode, Spencer is forced to lie to Mrs. Benson about Freddie's whereabouts because she does not know about his and Sam's relationship. Because Sam is in a relationship with Freddie, her previous torture monkey, her new torture monkey is Gibby. Gibby hates like how Sam treats him so he decides to consult with Mrs. Benson about Sam and Freddie's relationship. She does not approve, so she and Gibby devise a plan to break them up. The plan backfires when Carly accidentally reveals to Sam and Freddie that Gibby told Mrs. Benson about them, causing her to attack Gibby in retaliation. Because of this, he and Mrs. Benson force Carly to reveal to them that Sam sabotaged Freddie's application to a prestigious camp; which they use to make him angry at her. However, Carly stops the fight and helps Sam and Freddie make up, with the help of Gibby, who sends Mrs. Benson away having had a change of heart. In the next episode, Carly suggests that Sam and Freddie try each other's hobbies, but when Sam visits Freddie's model train club she blows up the trains, Freddie gets kicked out. Then Sam takes Freddie to visit her Uncle Carmine and Cousin Chaz in prison, but she also makes him put ham in his pants which eventually gets him caught by security, angering Carmine and Chaz. Sam and Freddie end up deciding to break up at the end because of something Carly said that they overheard about their relationship being forced by a connection they have but their personalities are too different. The relationship ends on a relatively friendly note, with hints of rekindling should one of them work on their personality. Almost immediately after breaking up, Freddie admits to Sam for the very first time that he loves her, and she says she loves him, too; causing them to prolong their break-up for one more night together. After the first few episodes of this season, T-Bo moves into Freddie and Mrs. Benson's apartment in \\"Bushwell Plaza\\", after being evicted from \\"The Groovy Smoothie\\", making him Carly and Spencer's neighbor as well. Sam and Freddie help him do this by disguising him as a respectful gentleman, which initially works. However, Mrs. Benson finds out his true personality later and decides to kick him out. But after he assists her with rescuing the gang from a psycho-obsessed fan and her family, she decides to let him stay.

Their stated goal is to provide entrepreneurship education to students in middle and high school, inspiring ‚Äústudents to overcome barriers and seize opportunities for the betterment of themselves and others.‚Äù Origin In 1991, Liz and Charles Koch founded Youth Entrepreneurs, originally an eight-week course at a Wichita high school. By 2019, the organization had grown to a presence in over 126 schools throughout the United States. Goals and operations Youth Entrepreneurs states that their major objective is to provide high school students, particularly at-risk students, with business and entrepreneurial education and experiences that will help them prosper and become contributing members of society, by focusing primarily on three important objectives: # Providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to start their own businesses # Teaching students how to apply those entrepreneurial skills to become better employees, and # Encouraging students to continue onto higher education YE cites the following ‚ÄúFoundational Values‚Äù as the key to student success: Responsibility, Be Principled, Knowledge, Freedom, Passion, Opportunity, Sound Judgment and Win-Win Focus.‚Äù To work towards their goals, the organization now offers year-round high school classes in which students earn high school credits for learning and applying critical thinking skills and principles of free markets and economics that can help students excel in their careers in the business world, and in their endeavors in higher education. In addition to earning high school credits, by 2010 YE students could begin earning college credits through YE's partnership with institutions of higher learning like Butler Community College, offering students a chance to \\"get a head start on their college career\\". As well as getting ahead in a physical sense by earning college credits, students get a head start in thinking about businesses and entrepreneurial thinking through hands-on training, and helps students more confidently dive into the business world. Classes that run through the school year are supplemented by summer camps, like the one at Dodge City High School in Dodge City, Kansas provide students with an interactive and exciting way to practice business principles, while competing for cash prizes and receiving feedback for presented business ideas. In 2011, YE awarded $100,000 in scholarship money to YE alumni to pursue 4-year degrees. YE also supports alumni through mentorship programs, ensuring that they have a support structure including continuing education and networking to aid them in breaking into the business world. Controversy The YE program has been criticized for being a platform to disseminate the Koch philosophy and to sell Charles Koch's book. Charles and his brother David Koch were longtime supporters of the Libertarian Party before becoming Republican kingpins. In 1980 and at the beginning of the Reagan era, the Libertarian platform proposed a drastic revision of the American education system: \\"We advocate the complete separation of education and state. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.\\" YE High School posters target predominantly poor students with the premise of receiving generous financial incentives including startup capital and scholarships after graduation. YE classes are disguised as typical high school business courses, taught in public schools by a certified teacher. But they are actually guided by Youth Entrepreneurs, with lesson plans and class materials promoting the Koch Industries radical free-market Libertarian ideology. Course information includes: The minimum wage hurts workers and slows economic growth. Low taxes and less regulation allow people to prosper. Public assistance harms the poor. Government, in short, is the enemy of liberty. Importance Analysts recognize entrepreneurship as an essential part of economic development, and is especially necessary in areas like the Midwestern United States that have been hit hardest by recent economic recession. Education analyst Dr. Steve Wyckoff said of YEK's role in the rehabilitation of the economy of the Midwest, > One of the major issues we have in rural America is the shortage of jobs and > businesses. If we can find those students across rural America who have a > passion that can be applied in a local business, we can grow our own jobs. > We're never going to get businesses to move to rural Kansas in sufficient > numbers to solve the problem. It's imperative for the survival of rural > America that we begin to grow our own jobs. YEK works in partnership with the Network For Teaching Entrepreneurship, another international nonprofit organization dedicated to providing entrepreneurship programs to young people from low-income communities.

It has rough, compacted bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth bark above, narrow elliptic to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical fruit.flower budsfruitbark Description Eucalyptus cadens is a spreading tree that grows to a height of with a characteristic leaning habit, and forms a lignotuber. The bark on the lower of the trunk is rough, compacted and greyish brown to black. The higher parts of the trunk and branches have some greyish green bark, often with a few ribbons of shed bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptic to oblong leaves, long, wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are narrow elliptic to lance-shaped or curved, the same colour on both sides, long and wide with a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel . Mature buds are oval, spindle-shaped or diamond-shaped with a conical or slightly beaked operculum long. Flowering occurs between March and June and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide that is either sessile or on a pedicel up to long. The valves protrude beyond the rim of the capsule.A Field Guide to Eucalypts - Brooker & Kleinig volume 1, page 280 Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cadens was first formally described in 1989 by Barbara Briggs and Michael Crisp from a specimen at \\"the eastern foot of the Warby Range, between Wangaratta and Glenrowan\\". The specific epithet (cadens) is the present participle of the Latin word cado meaning \\"to fall\\", hence \\"falling\\", referring to the leaning habit of this species. Distribution and habitat Tumble-down swamp gum grows in woodlands, often in or around springs, soaks and waterbodies in the south- eastern foothills of the Pilot Range near Beechworth and Wooragee and in the eastern foothills of the Warby Range. Conservation Eucalyptus cadens is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species include grazing by domestic stock, weed invasion and changes in hydrology.

Studying the Upper Cambrian alum shales in Sweden, Kaufmann found that the trilobite genus Olenus occurred in an unbroken sequence of sediments covering a considerable period of geological time. He was thereby in a position to track the phylogenetic evolution of Olenus, that is, the rise and fall of species within the genus and the changes in their morphology. He coined the idea of Artabwandlung, which is the tendency of clade elements in the same environment to show the same morphological trends. Genetics, Paleontology and Macroevolution - Jeffrey S. Levinton With the 1930s onset of the Nazi regime in Germany, Kaufmann, who had Jewish roots, but had been baptised an evangelical Christian, was dismissed from his position at Greifswald University. He had studied at K√∂nigsberg and at Greifswald University under Serge von Bubnoff (1888‚Äì1957). His 1933 dissertation dealt with speciation and punctuated equilibrium in Cambrian trilobites in Sk√•ne. He left Germany for Copenhagen in 1933. Here he was denied employment as a geologist, and worked as a photographer and gave instruction in athletics. He found himself ill at ease in Denmark, and after a spell in Italy, returned to Germany where in October 1935 he started teaching at a Jewish school in Coburg, and was arrested on a charge of 'miscegenation' (he was being treated for a sexually transmitted disease acquired from a prostitute) and in 1936 sentenced to 3 years of hard labour. On his release in 1939 Kaufmann fled to Lithuania, where he was allowed to settle and resume geological work. When Lithuania became part of the U.S.S.R. in 1940 he joined the staff of the Geological Survey at Kaunas, immersing himself in the problems of Pleistocene drift, and marrying a fellow refugee. After the German occupation of Lithuania in 1941, and now an undesirable Jew, he was identified while cycling on a country road and executed by two German soldiers. Earlier, in his search for work, he had moved to Italy and found work in a photographic shop in Bologna. There, in the summer of 1935 he met Ingeborg Magnusson, a 28-year-old Swedish woman on holiday. This relationship was to last five years, during which period they spent 13 days together - he visited her once in Stockholm, and she saw him once in Germany. These details came to light in 1991 when a German stamp collector bought a package of 30 letters, written by Kaufmann to Ingeborg, at a Frankfurt stamp auction. http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59051-181-7http://www.trilobita.de/english/heroes.htmhttp://2dgf.dk/xpdf/bull-1946-11-1-142-144.pdf Meddelelser fra Dansk Geologisk Foreninghttp://www.jewishexponent.com/article/11965/Love_Letters/ Some Publications * Die Klufttektonik des Kambrosilurs von Gotland, Oeland und dem Kalmargebiet.

In December 2011, protesters demonstrated in Seoul and other areas after the government announced it had picked sites for two new nuclear plants. Among the most active South Korean organizations in the anti-nuclear movement is the Korea's largest environmental NGO, the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM). KFEM leads campaigns for a denuclearization, both in terms of weapons reduction and power generation solutions.  History of the Movement  The \\"East Coast Solidarity for Anti-Nuke Group\\" was formed in South Korea in January 2012. It was created by the Justice and Peace committees of the four Catholic dioceses of Andong, Busan, Daegu and Wonju. The group is against nuclear power or nuclear weapons and in favour of peace. The group will ask the government to cancel its plans for new nuclear power plants in Samcheok and Yeongdeok. They will also demand the closure of existing nuclear reactors in Wolseong and Gori, and release of information about them. In January 2012, 22 South Korean women's groups appealed for a nuclear free future, saying they believe nuclear weapons and power reactors \\"threaten our lives, the lives of our families and all living creatures\\". The women said they feel an enormous sense of crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, which demonstrated the destructive power of radiation in the disruption of human lives, environmental pollution, and food contamination. Unfortunately the claims made by the South Korean women's can not be back-up with any scientific data supporting this \\"destructive power of radiation\\". More than sixteen thousand lives were lost due to the earth quake and resulting tsunami but not a single life was lost due to the direct effects of radiation. The World Health Organization projects using the \\"Linear No Threshold Model\\" that there may be a slight increase in cancer over natural rate in the population. The eventual number of cancer deaths, according to the linear no-threshold theory of radiation safety, that will be caused by the accident is expected to be around 130‚Äì640 people in the years and decades ahead. Although the loss life due to any cause is of concern these projections are a small relative number compared to other risks. Choi Yul, president of Korea Green Foundation, has said \\"The March 11 disaster has proven that nuclear power plants are not safe\\". Choi said antinuclear sentiment is growing in South Korea amid the Fukushima crisis, and there is a chance to reverse the country's nuclear policy in 2012 because South Korea is facing a presidential election. He added that the anti-nuclear movement needs to spread internationally and Choi and other experts plan to create the Network for Nuclear Free East Asia. The group is scheduled to officially debut on March 11 with 311 members, from Japan, South Korea, China and other economies. In March 2012, on the first Fukushima nuclear disaster anniversary, South Korean environmental groups held a rally in Seoul to oppose nuclear power. Over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the largest in recent memory for an anti-nuclear rally. The demonstration demanded that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy of promoting nuclear power.  Moon Administration Promise for a Nuclear-Free South Korea  In June 2017, South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a press conference in front of the KORI-1 nuclear facility, during which he announced the plant's decommissioning, as well as a complete phase-out of nuclear power in the country, remarking that South Korea will \\"abolish our nuclear-centered energy policy, and move towards a nuclear-free era.\\" Known for his human rights pursuits, President Moon noted that the environment, life, and well being are more important than any other consideration. President Moon's defiant sentiment towards nuclear power marks a strong departure from the previous administration.

The vaccine is developed by Dr. Chil-Yong Kang and his research team at Western University‚Äôs Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in Canada. The result of the US FDA Phase I clinical trial completed in August 2013 showed no serious adverse effects in 33 participants. Vaccine Design Various approaches for HIV vaccine development The SAV001-H vaccine is considered as the first genetically modified version of the killed whole HIV-1 vaccine. According to Dr. Kang, HIV-1 strain is genetically engineered such that first, ‚Äúthe gene responsible for pathogenicity, known as nef‚Äù is removed to make it non-pathogenic and then the signal peptide gene is replaced with a honey bee toxin (melittin) signal peptide to make the virus production much higher and faster.Killed whole-HIV vaccine; employing a well established strategy for antiviral vaccines In the signal peptide exchange process, another gene called vpu is lost due to an overlapping.Video Conference: DR. CHIL-YONG KANG, Concordia University Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS Finally, this genetically modified version of HIV-1, (i.e., HIV-1 virus with nef negative, vpu negative and signal peptide gene replaced with honey bee‚Äôs) grown in human T-lymphocytes (A3.01 cell line) are collected and purified before inactivating them by AT-2 (aldrithiol-2 or 2,2'-Dipyridyldisulfide) chemical treatment and gamma irradiation. AT-2 chemical treatment is used because it does not affect the viral structure and immunogens.Inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity with preservation of conformational and functional integrity of virion surface proteins. This killed virus vaccine approach has successfully prevented polio, influenza, cholera, mumps, rabies, typhoid fever and hepatitis A for decades. At the moment, there are 16 animal vaccine based on this killed virus method including the feline immunodeficiency virus (which is closely related to HIV) vaccine for cats. Clinical Trials Phase I clinical trial (NCT01546818)Safety and Immune Response Assessment Study of Killed-whole HIV-1 Vaccine (SAV001-H) in Chronic HIV-1 Infected Patients. Funded by Sumagen Canada, the government of Canada and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,New HIV Vaccine Proves Successful In Phase 1 Human Trial it started in March 2012 to assess its safety, tolerability, and immune responses. This trial was a randomized, double blinded (both subject and investigator), placebo-controlled study, following intramuscular administration to 33 chronic HIV-1 infected individuals under the treatment with HAART. The study was completed in August 2013 and reported no serious adverse effects while boosting antibodies in the volunteers injected with SAV001-H vaccines. According to the researchers, the antibody against gp120 surface antigen and P24 capsid antigen increased up to 6-fold and 64-fold, respectively, and the increased level of antibody was continued throughout the 52-week study period.Canadian HIV Vaccine Pushes Through Trials Moreover, broadly neutralizing antibodies were found in some blood samples of the participants. Phase II clinical trial The Phase II clinical trial is expected to begin in 2018 Promising vaccine against HIV in development in Ontario in the United States to measure immune responses. The researchers plan to recruit about 600 HIV-negative volunteers who are in the high risk category for HIV infections such as commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users, and people who have unsafe sex with multiple partners. Therapeutic HIV Vaccine Status Dr. Kang has also developed a therapeutic HIV vaccine employing recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses carrying of HIV-1gag, pol and/or env genes. Researchers reported that the therapeutic vaccine induced robust cellular immune responses in animal tests recently conducted.Creation of highly efficient recombinant viral vectors for development of prime-boost vaccines. History of Killed HIV Vaccine Despite the fact that this killed whole virus strategy is widely exercised to prevent diseases like polio, influenza, cholera, mumps, rabies, typhoid fever and hepatitis A in the past, it failed to receive any serious attention in the effort to develop vaccines against HIV for various scientific, economical and technical reasons. First, there are risks associated with inadequately inactivated or not killed HIV remaining in vaccines. Second, a massive production of HIV is not economically feasible, if not impossible. Third, many researchers tend to believe that when HIV is killed or inactivated by chemical treatment, it loses its antigenicity and thus fails to induce both neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte or CD8+ T cells (CTL). Fourth, the early studies with the monkeys using the killed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine showed some optimism but it turned out that the protection was attributable to responses to both the cellular proteins on the SIV vaccine and on the challenge virus grown not in monkey cells but in human cells. Fifth, the fact that ‚Äúlab-adapted HIV-1 appeared to lose envelop glycoprotein, gp120, during preparation‚Äù was considered a crucial barrier to this method. Nevertheless, to date many scientists and researchers insist on a belief that the killed whole virus strategy is a feasible option for an HIV vaccine. Indeed, Jonas Salk developed a therapeutic HIV vaccine in 1987, called Remune now being developed by Immune Response BioPharma, Inc.,Immune Response BioPharma, Inc is based on the killed whole virus approach. Remune vaccine has completed over 25 clinical studies to date and showed a robust mechanism of action restoring white blood cell counts in CD4 & CD8 T cells by reducing viral load and increasing immunity. Also, a group of researchers and professionals in the field of HIV strongly advocates that the killed HIV approach must be taken to fight back the global HIV and AIDS epidemic.A Killed-Virus Vaccine for HIV/AIDS DID SCIENCE MISS ITS BEST SHOT AT AN AIDS VACCINE? The International AIDS Vaccine Research (IAVA) issued a report on ‚ÄúWhole Killed AIDS Vaccines‚Äù in 1999 reviewing a diverse aspect of the killed virus approach.IAVI Report on Whole Killed AIDS Vaccines Developer & Organizers  The developer of SAV001-H, Dr. Chil-yong Kang, is a professor of Virology in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at the University of Western Ontario since 1992. In addition to HIV preventive and therapeutic vaccine Dr. Kang is developing a second generation vaccine against hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus.

It obtains guidance and advice on specific matters relating to biosecurity from various other government agencies. Biosecurity is set of measures aimed at preventing the introduction and/or spread of harmful organisms, in order to minimise the risk of transmission of infectious diseases to people, animals and plants caused by viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms. As well as protecting the agricultural economy and other industries of countries, it protects human health against biorisks caused by natural occurrences, accident, or deliberate acts of bioterrorism. The term also extends to dealing with epidemic and pandemic diseases, with the World Health Organization (WHO) playing an important role in the management of the latter. WHO has described biosecurity as a strategic and integrated approach to analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and plant life and health and associated risks for the environment. Biosecurity protocols are also used in laboratories and research facilities to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties, particularly where dual-use research is being undertaken, for both peaceful and military applications. Terminology The term \\"biosecurity\\" has multiple meanings and is defined differently according to various disciplines. The term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities. Starting from the late 1990s in response to the threat of biological terrorism, biosecurity encompasses the prevention of the theft of biological materials from research laboratories. Full text These preventative measures are a combination of systems and practices put into its place at bioscience laboratories to prevent the use of dangerous pathogens and toxins for malicious use, as well as by customs agents and agricultural and natural resource managers to prevent the spread of these biological agents. WHO has described biosecurity as a strategic and integrated approach to analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and plant life and health and associated risks for the environment. The term has in the past been used purely to describe preventive and quarantine measures put in place to minimise the risk of invasive pests or diseases arriving at a specific location that could damage crops and livestock as well as the wider environment. However, the term has evolved to encompass much more. It includes managing biological threats to people, industries or environment. These may be from foreign or endemic organisms, but they can also extend to pandemic diseases and the threat of bioterrorism. US definitions In 2001, the US National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) defined biosecurity as \\"the sum of risk management practices in defense against biological threats\\", and its main goal as \\"protect[ing] against the risk posed by disease and organisms\\". The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) defines biosecurity as \\"everything that‚Äôs done to keep diseases and the pathogens that carry them ‚Äì viruses, bacteria, funguses, parasites and other microorganisms ‚Äì away from birds, property, and people\\". The National Academy of Sciences defines biosecurity as \\"security against the inadvertent, inappropriate, or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or biotechnology, including the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease\\". It is thus one aspect of health security. Governance and legislation In the US, biosecurity is governed by the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, which is within the Department of State. The Bureau promotes global health security as part of its role in the biodefense network, \\"because infectious disease threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental, have the potential to spread globally and affect American people and interests\\". The Department of State works with other US government agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also international organizations like the Pan American Health Organization and partner countries in order to protect US citizens. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is a panel of experts that reports to the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. It is tasked with recommending policies on such questions as how to prevent published research in biotechnology from aiding terrorism, without slowing scientific progress. It provides \\"advice, guidance, and leadership regarding biosecurity oversight of dual-use research to all Federal departments and agencies with an interest in life sciences research\\". The Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) regulates the use of biological select agents and toxins that could pose a severe threat directly to human, animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products that may be consumed. FSAP is jointly managed by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) at the CDC, which is part of the HHS, and the Agriculture Select Agent Services (AgSAS) at APHIS, which is part of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). DSAT is concerned with human health, while AgSAS is concerned with animals and plants. Securing our Agriculture and Food Act 2017 A bipartisan bill described as an \\"agro-terrorism bill\\" was signed by the President and passed in both houses 2017, the result of concerns raised after the 2015 outbreak of avian influenza that had a devastating effect on poultry in Iowa. The response to that emergency had revealed cracks in the federal government‚Äôs ability to react quickly to this type of large-scale animal disease outbreak, and raised concerns about the nation's ability to respond to agro-terrorism. The new legislation, called Securing our Agriculture and Food Act (H.R. 1238), amended the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs, to lead the federal government‚Äôs efforts to ensure the security of food, agriculture and veterinary systems against terrorism and other high-risk events, thus making this person responsible for coordinating the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security. Agriculture and aquaculture Naturally occurring pathogens are a constant battle for the U.S. agriculture and aquaculture industries. Aquaculture Biosecurity measures in aquaculture may include: * Isolation ‚Äî Minimizing human-fish contact, and keeping fish safe from predators. * Disinfection ‚Äî Avoiding cross-contamination through disinfection and cleaning protocols. * Monitoring ‚Äî Collecting culture samples for routine surveillance. * Destruction ‚Äî Eradicating harmful organisms. Medical countermeasures Medical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack, or in the case of public health emergencies. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats. The FDA runs a program called the \\"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\\" (MCMi). It helps support \\"partner\\" agencies and organizations prepare for public health emergencies that could require MCMs. Its partners include government agencies at all levels of government, NGOs, universities, research centers, and FDA medical product centers. The federal government provides funding for MCM- related programs. In June 2016, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill that would continue funding four specific medical countermeasure programs: * $512 million for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) * $510 million for BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF) * $575 million for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) * $72 million for pandemic influenza Challenges The destruction of the World Trade Center in Manhattan on September 11, 2001 by terrorists and a subsequent wave of anthrax attacks on US media and government outlets (both real and hoax) led to increased attention on the risk of bioterrorism attacks in the United States. This led to increased funding to prepare for and respond to threats of bioterrorism. The US spent about $60 billion between October 2001 and September 2011. In the October 2011 Bio-Response Report Card, the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (established in 1994 as the Center for Counterproliferation Research, as an outgrowth of the Defense Counterproliferation Initiative) stated that the major challenges to biosecurity were: * attribution * communication * detection and diagnosis * environmental cleanup * medical countermeasure availability * medical countermeasure development and approval process * medical countermeasure dispensing * medical management See also * Biorisk * Biosafety * Bioterrorism * Global Health Security Initiative * Good Agricultural Practices * International Health Regulations * Invasive species * Public health * Quarantine * World Health Organization References Further reading * Includes major statutes, regulations, case law, research publications and other reports, resources (government and civil) and publications * External links  * ","title":"Biosecurity in the United States"},{"id":"34406104","text":"Pandripani is a village in Malkangiri district of Odisha state of India.

Eddie likes watching old films on video with his mother. Michael likes video games and the street. They are total opposites that argue like an old married couple. Leaving behind the grim, oppressive reality of Liverpool (in the 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were amongst the highest in the UK), they stumble into the bizarre fantasy world of a gay transvestite nightclub called The Fruit Machine, run by \\"Annabelle\\". There, they witness a brutal gangland murder by Echo that transforms their thirst for adventure into a run for their lives. Alone and afraid, yet hopeful, they wind up in Brighton with Vincent and Eve at Wonderland, where their path is strewn with manipulation, deceit and murder.

Casting The younger brother of actor Craig Charles, Emile Charles plays the role of Eddie. Filming The film was shot on location in Liverpool, Brighton and London. Included were interior and main entrance scenes at the Britannia Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool. Flamingo Land in Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire was used for the fun park known as Wonderland. Music The soundtrack was written by then newcomer Hans Zimmer. A soundtrack has never officially been released; however a 20-minute piece entitled The Fruit Machine Suite appears on the album HANS ZIMMER: The British Years, a sampling of the composer's earlier film work. The disco dance sequence used music from both Divine, a drag queen who had released several singles in the UK charts in the 1980s, and Man 2 Man, using their hit \\"Male Stripper\\". The film's title song was produced by Stock, Aitken & Waterman and sung by Paul Lekakis. Home media The film has had two DVD releases. In the UK on 16 July 2007 and on 9 April 2009, the German-based Pro- Fun Media released a region free digitally remastered edition in Anamorphic widescreen (1.66:1), including booklet and trailer. A North American Region 1 DVD version never materialised, only the original VHS titled Wonderland. Reception A reviewer for London's Time Out magazine stated that 'Saville films Frank Clarke's script in a mishmash of styles, and the pace sometimes flags' but nonetheless that 'it's as camp as Christmas, and if it rarely hits the jackpot, playing along with it is wildly enjoyable'. Another reviewer stated that the film is 'a hotch-potch of ideas woven together - making a mountainous and chronically unbelievable mess'. David Hall stated that the film 'is a bit of a mix' but that 'the parts that shine however are quite beautiful, as too is the lush score by noted composer Hans Zimmer'.

Although it is the largest sea cucumber known in the western Atlantic Ocean, it is so well camouflaged that it was 1980 before it was first described. It is placed in the subgenus Thymiosycia making its full name Holothuria (Thymiosycia) thomasi. Description Holothuria thomasi receives its vernacular name from its resemblance to a tiger's tail. It takes the form of an elongated cylinder with rounded ends and can reach long. It is mottled with patches and streaks of dark brown, golden brown and white, sometimes with irregular rings of colour. On the upper side there are papillae, thorn-like projections, which are dark brown tipped with white. The underside is paler and has several longitudinal rows of tube feet. The animal has no eyes and the mouth is at the anterior end surrounded by a fringe of about 20 shield-shaped tentacles. When it is feeding, this end is enlarged. When small, individuals move about freely, but larger ones conceal themselves in crevices or under projections and are seldom seen.Holothuria thomasi Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

Its favoured habitat is the escarpments of the outer reef, between the outer ridge and the steep reef slopes. Biology Holothuria thomasi is a scavenger. Keeping its posterior end firmly anchored in a crack or underneath a rock, it sweeps the surrounding sand and algae-covered rocks with the front third of its body. The tentacles grab the detritus, sand, gravel and algae that it encounters and pushes them into its mouth. It then processes this material in its gut and expels the inedible fragments through its anus.

Two Catholic girls, Paula Strong (6) and Clare Hughes (4), both dressed as witches, were approached by a white-haired man carrying a suitcase. He asked for directions to Benny's Bar. After one of the girls gave him the directions, he gave her two pence and walked along Garmoyle Street to its junction with Ship Street, where the pub was located.The Troubles: a chronology of the Northern Ireland conflict magazine #18.

The explosion The girls were in the vicinity of the Catholic-owned pub, which was full of patrons, when a maroon-coloured mini containing a bomb exploded outside the building's Ship Street wall where it had been parked. No warning had been given. Part of the building collapsed onto the customers inside, injuring 12 people. Flying glass and masonry was hurled out into the street, instantly killing Paula Strong and fatally injuring Clare Hughes.

The girls were buried in Milltown Cemetery. The bombing had been carried out by a unit of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), which was the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland and which was legal at the time.Note: The UDA would not be banned by the British Government until 1992 Benny's Bar was targeted by the UDA as it was believed to have been an Irish republican drinking den.Arthur, Max (1988).

It emerged during the trial that one of the bombers had worked with Paula Strong's father at the docks. The UDA continued attacking pubs owned or frequented by members of the Irish Catholic and nationalist community. Less than two months after the bombing, on 20 December, the UDA launched a gun attack on another Catholic-owned pub in Derry. That attack killed five Catholic civilians.McKittrick, p.309 Benny's pub and the houses in Ship Street have since been torn down, leaving a small section of the street near the Garmoyle Street intersection extant.

She was the daughter of Daniel Thwaites, M.P. for Blackburn, and was married to Robert Yerburgh, M.P. for Chester. In the town of Blackburn she was known for her generosity to the company's workers and as a public benefactor, who helped fund the construction of the War Memorial wing to Blackburn Royal Infirmary and helped found the town's Empire Theatre, now named after her. Her name was also commemorated in \\"Elma's Pound\\", a beer specially brewed by Thwaites Brewery for Christmas 2007 to celebrate their 200th anniversary. Family She was born at Addison Lodge in Addison Road, near Holland Park, London, the daughter of Daniel Thwaites (1817‚Äì1888) and his wife, Eliza Amelia (n√©e Gregory) (1824‚Äì1907). An older brother, Edward, was born on 20 March 1861, but died in the August of the same year. Daniel Thwaites had taken control of the family brewery business in 1858 following the death of his father and the retirement of his brothers. In London on 8 August 1888 she married Robert Yerburgh (1853‚Äì1916), who had been elected as Member of Parliament for Chester in the 1886 general election. The couple had first met earlier that year at Winfield House, the home of Sir Harry Hornby, M.P. for Blackburn. The wedding had been postponed for several weeks because of the ill health of her father. Shortly after the marriage, the couple joined her parents at the family estate at Barwhillanty, near Parton, Kirkcudbrightshire, where her father died on 21 September 1888. There were two sons of the marriage: *Robert Daniel Thwaites Yerburgh (10 December 1889 ‚Äì 27 November 1955), who became M.P. for South Dorset and was created the first Baron Alvingham, of Woodfold in the County Palatine of Lancaster on 10 July 1929. *Richard \\"Guy\\" Cecil Yerburgh (5 November 1892 ‚Äì 13 March 1926), who became a Major in the Irish Guards and was decorated with the Croix de Guerre and the Croce di Guerra and was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.). Thwaites Brewery On the death of her father, Elma and her new husband inherited the family brewery business. Her father's will had made provision for the brewery to be sold, with the proceeds, together with the family estates, to be held in trust for Elma. Despite this, Elma decided to retain the brewery and continue the family business under the management of William Ward, who was executor of her father's will and Elma's cousin, being the son of Daniel's eldest sister, Betsey. During the early years after her marriage, Mrs. Yerburgh left the management of the brewery to William Ward, while she was occupied with family matters, including the birth of her two children. The couple spent most of their time living at Princes Gate in South Kensington and at Billinge Scar, near Blackburn, interspersed with visits to the other family estates before settling at Woodfold Hall. Prior to the death of Daniel Thwaites, plans had been drawn up to incorporate the business into a limited company. These had been postponed as a result of his death, but were finally put in place in March 1897, after William Ward had left the business. Mrs. Yerburgh transferred the business into the new company, Daniel Thwaites & Co. Limited, for the total of ¬£850,000 (of which ¬£250,000 was placed in the Daniel Thwaites Settlement) in a mixture of ordinary shares, preference shares, debenture stock and cash, with the general public subscribing for ¬£134,000 in new preference shares. Following incorporation, the brewery business continued to expand with a programme of modernisation, extension to the brewery buildings and the purchase of licensed premises. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Elma's husband, Robert, was suffering from heart trouble and the couple were in the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Germany. The couple were not allowed to leave immediately and were initially placed under curfew before being detained as prisoners of war under the orders of the military governor of Frankfurt. Nine weeks later, they were allowed to leave and were sent to Switzerland where they were required to stay for three weeks before returning to England. Robert's health continued to deteriorate and he died in December 1916, aged 63. In the inter-war period, Thwaites embarked on a programme of expansion by the acquisition of competitors and to fund this the directors decided to increase the share capital to ¬£1million in 1922. The first major purchase came in August 1923, when the company acquired Henry Shaw & Co., which owned the New Brewery in Salford (in the centre of Blackburn) and had a strong presence in Darwen. Following the merger, Shaw's chairman, Sir John Rutherford, former M.P for Darwen became a director and substantial shareholder in Thwaites, becoming vice-chairman in 1924. At the same time, Thwaites bought the James Pickup Wines & Spirits Company, thus enabling them to expand their sales of wines and spirits. In May 1927, Thwaites acquired the Fountain Free Brewery, based in Rishton, together with its 11 tied houses. Personality Yerburgh was known for her \\"careful attention to detail\\", her \\"conscientiousness in fulfilling her duties\\" and her \\"decisiveness in business matters\\". She was \\"an honourable, upright, just and unselfish woman (who) remained singularly modest and retiring all her life\\". She sometimes appeared \\"brusque and too forthright\\" but this disguised an inherent reticent, shy nature. Despite being a generous benefactor and employer, she avoided courting publicity. Generosity as an employer As an employer, she always took a close interest in the welfare of her staff and would often provide treats funded out of her own pocket. A sick workman, or one with an ill family member, would receive extra money and food. When she was told that someone had taken advantage of her generosity, she replied: \\"As long as I do not miss helping someone in real need, I can stand being bitten.\\" In December 1897, Mrs. Yerburgh began the tradition of giving a Christmas gift of 10 lbs of prime English beef to each workman and a turkey or goose to office staff. In 1926, despite her managers trying to scrap the Christmas box, she insisted that it be continued, but replaced the beef with ¬£1 for each workman. This gesture became known as \\"Elma's Pound\\" and still continues. During the First World War, many of the brewery's employees served in the armed forces. While employees were away on military service, Mrs. Yerburgh continued to pay their wages and ensured that their families were looked after and that their jobs were kept open until after the end of the war. On their return to work, the men received their backdated wages; the brewery also organised an outing to Blackpool for all ex-servicemen and their families, where they received an envelope containing ¬£25 for each year of military service. Homes Mrs. Yerburgh owned several properties across the United Kingdom; at her death these were Woodfold Park near Blackburn, Caythorpe Court in Lincolnshire, and Barwhillanty, in Scotland. During her lifetime, she also had homes in London on Addison Road, Princess Gate and Kensington Gore; at Freeby in Leicestershire and at Bryn Eithin and Cae Eithin in Colwyn Bay in North Wales. Yerburgh Avenue in Colwyn Bay is named after her. Billinge Scar Elma and her husband originally lived at Billinge Scar, to the west of Blackburn (at ), which had been acquired by her father in 1876. It had twelve bedrooms and a schoolroom where Elma was educated and was decorated with an ornate \\"Elizabethan fa√ßade complete with battlements\\". The property was later purchased by industrialist, William Birtwistle, but was demolished in the 1940s, with only the coach-house remaining. Woodfold Hall The couple later moved into the nearby family home at Woodfold Hall, near Mellor, north- west of Blackburn (at ). The hall was originally built for Henry Sudell, a cotton merchant, in 1799, before being acquired by John Fowden Hindle, who was High Sheriff of Lancashire In the late 1850s, the property was initially rented by Daniel Thwaites, Sr. before being purchased by his son in 1865. At its height, the property comprised over 20 ground floor rooms, built surrounding a courtyard; the house stood in a 400-acre estate, with a dairy and small brew house. During World War II, Mrs. Yerburgh moved away from the property to live in Scotland, and Woodfold Hall became a home for elderly women evacuated from Merseyside. On her death in 1946, the estate was inherited by her son, now Lord Alvingham, but he soon abandoned the property. In May 1949, the house contents were sold by auction and the house roof was removed (to avoid property taxes), allowing the house to decay. After an initial proposal to redevelop the estate as a golf course in 2000, the hall was refurbished and converted into \\"luxury apartments\\". The orangery on the estate is a Grade II listed building. Caythorpe Court In September 1907, she acquired the house and estate at Caythorpe Court in Lincolnshire, following the death of its first owner, Edgar Lubbock, a brewer and banker. Caythorpe Court was the smallest of the properties owned by Mrs. Yerburgh, being referred to by her as \\"The Cottage\\". During Mrs. Yerburgh's ownership, the gardens were re-designed by Percy Cane. During World War I, the property was used as an Auxiliary Military Hospital, with accommodation for 20 officers, at the wishes of Robert Yerburgh; in the next war, it became the headquarters for the 1st Airborne Division Signals. On Mrs. Yerburgh's death in December 1946 her will requested that the estate should be sold to become an Agricultural Education establishment. She also requested that the main buildings should be maintained as near as possible in their original condition. The property was acquired by Lincolnshire County Council, who operated it as the Kesteven Farm Institute; this later became the Kesteven Agricultural College before becoming part of the Leicester-based De Montfort University. It is now operated by PGL as a centre for adventure based holidays for both adults and children. The Empire Theatre In February 1910, Mrs. Yerburgh granted a lease (at an annual rent of ¬£12 2s and 6d) on 970 square yards of land she owned at the corner of Aqueduct Road and Bolton Road, Blackburn (at ) to Ferdinand Caton and Christopher Hope who founded the Empire Electric Theatre. Over the years, the theatre changed its identity several times until it was closed in the 1970s. A charitable trust was then formed to acquire the theatre and it eventually re-opened as the Thwaites Empire Theatre in October 2002. Blackburn Royal Infirmary The Blackburn and East Lancashire Royal Infirmary had originally opened in 1864 on a site in the Hollin Bank area (at ). On the death of Daniel Thwaites in 1888, Mrs. Yerburgh presented ¬£10,000 to the infirmary in his memory. Robert Yerburgh had been President of the Board of Management of the infirmary, and on his death in 1916, his widow donated a further ¬£3,500 to the hospital. Following the First World War, the Blackburn Memorial Committee decided to erect a memorial to local men lost in the war by the construction of a new wing, the War Memorial Wing, for which the Mayor, Lawrence Cotton, issued a public appeal to raise ¬£100,000. According to local legend, when the committee approached Thwaites Brewery for a contribution, Mrs. Yerburgh, on being informed that ¬£38,000 was still required, wrote out a cheque for ¬£36,000 saying \\"I have no doubt the good people of Blackburn and district will donate the rest.\\" By 1923, sufficient funds had been raised to enable construction to commence and on 24 May 1924, after a procession through the streets of Blackburn and amongst much pomp and ceremony, Mrs. Yerburgh laid the foundation stone with the words: \\"In the faith of Jesus Christ we place this Foundation Stone, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\\" On 16 June 1928, construction was complete and Mrs. Yerburgh was invited to formally open the new wing which she did with the words \\"I hereby declare this War Memorial Wing of the Blackburn and East Lancashire Royal Infirmary to be now open.\\" A bronze plaque was later placed in the entrance hall to the new wing, bearing the inscription: > Blackburn and East Lancashire Royal Infirmary. > WAR MEMORIAL WING > These buildings were erected as a memorial to the men from Blackburn > And East Lancashire who fell in the Great War 1914‚Äî1918 > The foundation stone was laid by Mrs. R.A. Yerburgh on May 24th 1924 > and the opening ceremony performed by her on June 16th, 1928. Nine years later, a ward in the new wing was named after Mrs. Yerburgh. In 2006, the new Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital was opened and the Royal Infirmary was closed. The property was sold to Barratt Homes and most of the old infirmary was demolished. The memorial wing has been retained for integration into the re-development of the site and is planned to be converted into 53 apartments. By retaining the War Memorial Wing, it was hoped that \\"the memory of those men and women of East Lancashire who have laid down their lives for their country will live on and hopefully never be forgotten\\". In March 2011, the old War Memorial wing was still standing although in a derelict condition with no work going on. By 2018 the War Memorial Wing had been demolished and built over. Commemorative stained glass windows from the structure have been incorporated into corridor design in the new Royal Blackburn Hospital. Death For the duration of the Second World War, Mrs. Yerburgh spent most of her time at her Scottish home, \\"Barwhillanty\\". Now in her eighties and suffering from lack of mobility, she left the day-to-day management of the brewery in the hands of her co-directors. In order to provide for the succession of the family business, she decided to leave her properties to her son Robert (Baron Alvingham), with her shares in the company being passed to her grandsons, John and Oscar (the children of Guy). Mrs. Yerburgh fell seriously ill in November 1946 and died at Barwhillanty on 6 December, aged 82; she was buried at Parton kirkyard. Her gravestone bears the inscription: \\"In loving memory of Elma Amy Yerburgh, born 30th July 1864, died 6th December 1946. 'And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it'.\\" In her will, she made legacies to several charities, continuing the benevolence she had demonstrated all her life. Following her death, she was dubbed Blackburn's \\"Lady Bountiful\\". Tributes and memorials On 5 September 1935, Mrs. Yerburgh was made an Honorary Freeman of the County Borough of Blackburn; she was the first, and only, woman to be so honoured. In the ceremony awarding the honour, Alderman Taylor said: > Today, we meet to honour a lady who has rendered eminent services for, and > done untold good in, her native town. In honouring her, we honour Blackburn. > The freedom of the borough is the highest dignity we can confer, and Mrs. > Yerburgh richly deserves it. She had ever shown practical sympathy with > those less fortunate than herself. In 1960, a new public house, named the \\"Elma Yerburgh\\", was built in King Street, Blackburn (at ), to replace the old Commercial Hotel which had been demolished during the construction of a new housing development at Montague Street. The pub is now the site of a tool hire depot. In 2007, to commemorate their 200th anniversary, Thwaites Brewery launched a special range of beers including its Christmas beer, Elma's Pound, in recognition of Elma Yerburgh's generosity. The beer (4.9 per cent ABV), was described as a \\"full-bodied, auburn coloured beer (which) boasts bittersweet flavours with a spicy aromatic finish\\". In the history of Thwaites Brewery written by Jehanne Wake, published in 2007 to mark the 200th anniversary of its foundation, John Yerburgh dedicates the book to his grandmother: > She guided the brewery through years of difficulty and two world wars as > well as ones of steady expansion and post-war reconstruction. She was a > brilliant businesswoman and it is through her skill and foresight that > Daniel Thwaites still exists as a family company. As she recognised, the > strength of any firm lies in its people. The calibre of the employees today > will ensure that the high standards she set for quality and innovation at > Thwaites will continue for another 200 years.

She was notably a senior soloist for The Australian Ballet, and variously performed for the Queensland Ballet, Basel Ballet, Ballet Victoria and Royal New Zealand Ballet. Early life Roma Jean Egan was born in Camberwell East, Victoria. Her primary education was at Hawthorn East State School and Croydon North State School (where she was Dux), and her secondary education was at Box Hill Grammar School and the Methodist Ladies' College (MLC), Melbourne. When Egan was 6 yrs, she first began ballet cases run by Edith Lynton; a widow whose husband was killed in Borneo in 1945. Lynton had a varied career as a champion Highland dancer, a theatre actress, an announcer, a ballet mistress for the J. C. Williamson Company, and had travelled to England receiving degrees and honours from the British Association of Teachers of Dancing. Lynton was also a judge in the major Eisteddfods in Australia.The Advocate, 20 August 1954, p. 12. Egan carried out her Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) grade exams under Edith Lynton, up to Grade 5 obtaining honours for all of them. Under Lynton's tutelage, Egan also participated in many Victorian Eisteddfods successfully. Training Egan signed up with the Bambi Smith Modelling College, and was commissioned for photo modelling in knitting magazines and modelled clothes on catwalks around the ages of 8‚Äì10 yrs. The modelling college taught Roma all aspects of modelling from how to walk, deportment, etiquette, and elocution. Bambi Smith (n√©e Patricia Tuckwell) was married to Athol Shmith who had a famous photography studio in Collins Street. Athol & Bambi divorced in 1957 and Bambi then went onto marry Lord Harewood, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. After Egan finished her Grade 5 RAD exams, at the age of 11 she then studied under Paul Hammond at the Elementary, Intermediate, Advanced, and Solo Seal levels. Paul Hammond had professionally danced for the Glyndebourne Ballet in the UK and for Edouard Borovansky (founder of the Borovansky Ballet) in Melbourne. While Egan was studying at the elementary level with Paul Hammond, she also took up acting and appeared on ABC television's Terrific Adventures of the Terrible Ten (Pacific Films)\\"Terrible Ten sequel for ABV-2 showing\\", The Age, 16 February 1961, p. 23 whose studios were behind GTV9 (now called Channel Nine) in Bendigo Street, Richmond. The filming occurred on weekends and the show was directed by Roger Mirams. During the week, on the Tarax Show Egan was part of GTV9 junior ballet, called The Royal Dancers, performing two times a week with a different routine for each show. The Royal Dancers notably also included Denise Drysdale and was directed by Valmai Ennor, a former dancer with the Sadler's Wells Ballet.The Australian Women's Weekly, 28 November 1962, p. 58. The junior ballet also screened on In Melbourne Tonight (IMT), starring Bert Newton and Graham Kennedy, also on GTV9. Egan is related on her paternal side to Bert Newton's wife, Patti McGrath. Pacific Films encouraged Egan to become an actress, however, her heart was more with classical ballet. So she pulled out of GTV9 to focus on ballet. At the age of 15, Egan's father died and these were difficult times. After completing her Intermediate and Leaving Certificates at high school, Egan studied full-time for six months under Paul Hammond, completing her Intermediate (honours) and Advanced RAD (highly commended) examinations. The Australian Ballet School (ABS) had just begun in 1964, and in 1965 Egan was one of 20 successful applicants nationwide to undertake a 2-yr diploma in dance, under Dame Margaret Scott. The ABS was founded in 1964 to create a homogenous style and exclusively feed new talent into the Australian Ballet (formed 1962). In December 1965, during the ABS holidays, Roma auditioned at the St. Martin's Theatre, South Yarra, Melbourne, to earn money to help support herself. The theatre accepted her and she played a prominent role in Peter O'Shaughnessy's Mumba Jumba and the Bunyip starring Barry Humphries. Much later in life, in 1998, Egan graduated with a Master of Fine Arts, majoring in dance psychology, at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Performance career In October 1966, Russell Kerr came to the ABS to audition students for the New Zealand Ballet, and Egan obtained a contract with him. She worked in various productions including Petrushka, and also the ABC filming of Petrushka starring Jonty Trimmer. Charles Lisner, founder and director of the Queensland Ballet, had for the first time obtained a government grant to engage six full- time dancers. Egan arrived in Brisbane in January 1969 and performed in the opening of Oedipus Rex and Swan Lake at the SGIO Theatre. In the following season Egan performed in Garth Welch's production of Giselle and Welch's ballet called Counterfeit. In June 1969, Egan auditioned for the Australian Ballet under the directorship of Dame Peggy van Praagh and was admitted in August that year. In the intervening time Egan moved to Adelaide and trained with Joanna Priest in her Childer's Street studio for two months. Egan was promoted to soloist in late 1971. Graeme Murphy made his first choreographic work, Ecco le Diavole, to music by Nino Rota, presented at Melbourne's Princess Theatre in July 1971, featuring Roslyn Anderson, Roma Egan, Janet Vernon, and Wendy Walker. In 1972, Egan took leave of absence, for a break, visited the Kiryat Shmona kibbutz, near the Golan Heights, in Israel. In late 1972, Egan went to the London Dance Centre to secure a contract with an international ballet company. She was accepted by the newly formed Basel Ballet, Switzerland, directed by Heinz Spoerli. However, the contract did not start until August 1973, so she danced for Ballet VictoriaBorder Morning Mail, 7 July 1973, p. 1. in the intervening months under the directorship of Laurel Martyn.The Age, 11 June 1973, p. 2. In January 1974, Egan rejoined the Australian Ballet, with Dame Peggy van Praagh still at the helm. During this time, Egan was promoted to senior soloist. In 1976, she was awarded a teaching scholarship from the National Theatre, Prague, Czechoslovakia. Roma left for Czechoslovakia to study Russian teaching techniques for seven months; after which she returned to Australia. She rejoined the Australian Ballet, in early 1977, under the directorship of Anne Woolliams. Artistic direction and teaching On 8 August 1981, Egan retired from the Australian Ballet, to take up the position as assistant artistic director at the Queensland Ballet. Egan was with the Queensland Ballet for two years, teaching daily classes, rehearsing, coaching, and reproducing ballets from videos. In 1984‚Äì1985, Egan was invited to take guest classes for the Sydney Dance Company under the directorship of Graeme Murphy and with the Australian Ballet under the directorship of Maina Gielgud. In 1986, Egan formed the National Ballet Centre in Wooloowin, Brisbane, located in the Heritage Hall. The Centre offered ballet from the ages of three (Kinderballet) to about 20-yrs (Advanced Classical); in some cases with students training the whole 17-years from the pre-school through to their university years. This included choreographing for each end of year performance and developing a Vaganova-based syllabus. The choreographer Fiona Bryant was trained by Egan.

For playback, the speakers may be positioned in a circle around the listeners or in any other configuration. Typical speaker configurations are eight spaced on a circle by 45¬∞ (oriented with first speaker 0¬∞ or at 22.5¬∞), or the vertices of a cube to create a double quadraphonic set-up with elevation . In reference to his own work, Karlheinz Stockhausen made a distinction between these two forms, reserving the term \\"octophonic\\" for a cube configuration, as found in his Oktophonie and the electronic music for scene 2 and the Farewell of Mittwoch aus Licht, and using the expression \\"eight-channel sound\\" for the circular arrangement, as used in Sirius, Unsichtbare Ch√∂re, or Hours 13 to 21 of the Klang cycle (; ). While quadraphonic sound uses four speakers positioned in a square at the four corners of the listening space (either on the ground or raised above the listeners), this cubical kind of octophonic spatialization offers both horizontal and vertical sound spatialization, meaning listeners get a sense of height. In order for such movement in space to be heard, it is necessary that rhythms be slow, and pitches change mainly in small steps or in glissandos . Some notable composers who have worked with octophonic spatialisation include Karlheinz Stockhausen, Jonathan Harvey, G√©rard Pape, and Larry Austin. The first known octophonic (that is, eight-channel) electronic music was John Cage's Williams Mix (1951‚Äì53) for eight separate simultaneously played back quarter-inch magnetic tapes (; ). Austin later made a surround-sound octophonic mix of Williams Mix, Williams (re)Mix[ed] (1997‚Äì2000), using the score and different sound sources . This version is intended to be played back on eight speakers surrounding the audience in a 360¬∞ circle, using (unlike Cage's original version) stereo source recordings heard in adjacent speaker pairs . Octophonic sound (in the general sense of eight-channel playback) was stimulated primarily by \\"the equal coverage it provides to all listening angles\\" and also by the precedence of eight-channel (initially tape) sound and subsequent ease of playback .

He is best known as mentor to and collaborator with comedian Barry Humphries in his early career. O'Shaughnessy was a major exponent of Samuel Beckett, both in Australia and in Ireland. He produced the first Waiting for Godot in Australia in 1957. He played Krapp in the Australian premier of Krapp's Last Tape at the Arts Theatre in Melbourne in 1959. He also toured a second production of Godot in Sydney and Canberra in 1969, and later directed the Irish premi√®res of Not I (1978), Footfalls (1978), and Rockaby (1984), and the unofficial world premiers of Theatre I and Theatre II (later published in modified form as Rough for Theatre I and II) in Cambridge in 1977.Russell Smith and Chris Akerley,\\"Samuel Beckett's Reception in Australia and New Zealand\\", The International Reception of Samuel Beckett, London, Continuum 2009, pp 108‚Äì128 (Martin Feldman and Mark Dixon eds). O'Shaughnessy was also noted for his one- act performances of Diary of a Madman, adapted from Gogol. In 1968 he co- created an illustrated anthology, The Restless Years, based on his award- winning television program of the same name (not to be confused with the 1977‚Äì81 soap opera The Restless Years). After making significant inroads to bring Shakespeare to Australian audiences in the 1960s, his Australian career was cut short after a libelous review published in The Australian by Katharine Brisbane. After a trial and an unsuccessful appeal, the case was ultimately determined in the High Court of Australia, where he was vindicated.\\"O'Shaughnessy v. Mirror Newspaper Ltd\\" (1970) 125 CLR 166, austlii.edu.au; at pages 172-77. However, he could no longer work in Australia. In 1970 he left for London and continued to act in and direct Shakespeare in the UK and Ireland. For The British Council he has lectured on the plays of Shakespeare to universities in many countries of Europe, and in West Africa and South America. As a historian, his two books on General Joseph Holt and his book on John Mitchel are significant contributions to Australian/Irish history. Collaboration with Barry Humphries One of O'Shaughnessy's lasting legacies was his mentoring of the young Barry Humphries who has acknowledged that, \\"without O'Shaughnessy's nurturing and promotion, the character of Edna Everage would have been nipped in the bud after 1956 and never come to flower, while the character of Sandy Stone would never have taken shape as a presence on the stage\\".Barry Humphries. More Please (1992) Viking, pp 176‚Äì77 With O'Shaughnessy's encouragement, the character (Everage) ... developed considerably.Richard Stone,\\"Bunyippy Traits\\", National Library of Australia News 2003, Vol XIII, No 4, p. 12. In September 1957, he staged the first Australian production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot at the Arrow Theatre in Melbourne with himself as Vladimir and Humphries as Estragon. It proved a hit with both audiences and critics. The critic of the Melbourne Sun wrote \\"so engrossing and well-done is this extraordinary adventure by Samuel Beckett regimented by Peter O'Shaughnessy's tender care that for me the evening passed by on wings\\". Later in the same year, O'Shaughnessy planned a production of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion for December, in tandem with a children's play to be performed at matinees. Part of the idea for a bush story involving a bunyip came from Frank Dalby Davison's book Children of the Dark People in which Old Man Bunyip is a wise guardian of the bush. After rejecting various scripts, O'Shaughnessy, Humphries and two radio scriptwriters, Jeff Underhill and Don Whitelock, produced their own script, which became The Bunyip and the Satellite.\\"Bunyippy Traits\\", pandora.nla.gov.au; accessed 16 April 2015. The children's show was a hit, and Humphries' performance as the Bunyip widely praised. O'Shaughnessy himself wrote that \\"Barry's performance as The Bunyip was the finest and most touching he had ever given in the theatre, and the character very close to his secret heart.\\" Humphries described his creation as a \\"prancing bird-like clown with a falsetto that inevitably got huskier after twelve performances a week\\". In an interview in the Australian magazine Theatre in 1960, Humphries went further by linking the bush creature with another of his recent creations, the suburban denizen Edna Everage: 'I notice Mrs Everage sometimes behaves in a slightly Bunyippy way ... she gives a spasmodic leap, which I subsequently recognise as a rather bunyippy trait. High Court Case O'Shaughnessy received a scathing review for the 1967 Sydney production of Othello, which he directed and starred as Othello, from theatre critic for The Australian, Katharine Brisbane. She said, in part: \\"Stupidity and lack of talent are forgivable; brave failures are deserving of praise ‚Äì these are every day human failings. But the waste and dishonesty of this production ... made me very angry indeed.\\" O'Shaughnessy launched action for defamation. The case for O'Shaughnessy was argued before the High Court by 27-year-old junior counsel Mary Gaudron (later a High Court judge) in her first High Court case after O'Shaughnessy sacked Clive Evatt. According to O'Shaughnessy, \\"she cut a valiant figure, this 'slip of a girl', who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise. And perhaps, when all is said and done, by her sheer cheek in taking on the case.\\" He won a unanimous judgment, successfully arguing that Brisbane had imputed that he had promoted his performance at the expense of his fellow actors, and that it was open to the jury to find that the use of the word 'dishonest' imputed such a dishonourable motive and therefore could be viewed as a statement of fact which had to be justified by evidence of which there was none to that effect. In a joint judgment, Barwick, McTiernan, Menzies and Owen wrote: \\"This is one of those cases where the critic, in making her evaluation that the production was a disaster ... did not plainly confine herself to commenting upon facts truly stated; she wrote what could, we think, have been regarded as amounting to a defamatory statement of fact, viz. that the producer dishonestly suppressed the roles of other players to highlight his own role.\\" In a separate judgment, Windeyer went further: \\"the matter published by the respondent in its newspaper was a vigorous, and in parts abusive criticism of a public performance of 'Othello'\\". The court held this was not fair comment on the performance as such, and ordered a retrial. However, the case did not go back to court. The newspaper settled with O'Shaughnessy. However, it had a lasting impact on O'Shaughnessy's career, for he left for London shortly afterwards effectively ending his career on the Australian stage. As for Brisbane, she saw it the making of her career: \\"So they settled ... which was a bit sad. But after that my columns were read.\\"Rosalie Higson, \\"The journey from stage to page\\", theaustralian.com.au, 26 July 2011. Legacy Phillip Adams wrote in The Australian, under the banner \\"Gonged but not forgotten\\", an article pointing out a number of Australians who had made a significant contribution to their respective fields who had not received the public recognition of an Order of Australia' ... here's a partial list of the worthies who didn't make the cut ...

On 5 June 2015, it was announced that Roberts had re-signed with the Titans on a three-year contract, however it was later discovered that his manager had forged his signature onto the contract, ruling it null and void. This subsequently lead to Roberts requesting a release from the club. Roberts finished off the 2015 NRL season as the Titans leading try-scorer with 16 tries in 24 matches.

An ambulance was called but Roberts regained consciousness and allegedly went to another pub to continue drinking for the rest of the night. Roberts received a $20,000 fine from the NRL but escaped suspension, instead being ordered to undergo a wellbeing plan which included community service on his days off for his public nuisance charge. In the Week 1 Elimination Finals match against the Gold Coast Titans, Roberts was placed on report for kicking Ryan Simpkins when he got up from a tackle. Roberts was later found guilty of the contrary conduct charge and was suspended for the do-or-die Week 2 Semi Finals match against the North Queensland Cowboys which the Broncos lost 26-20 in golden point extra time, ending their season. Roberts finished the year with 9 tries in 25 matches. On 30 September, it was reported that Roberts was visiting Thailand with a close family friend and had checked himself into a rehabilitation facility in order to help him overcome multifaceted personal issues, including a battle with alcohol. His manager and uncle stated 'I'm grateful for the support the Broncos have given James, and that everyone at the club cares about him as a person'. 2017 In January 2017, Roberts allegedly pulled a woman's hair at a Gold Coast Night club and was issued with a drunk diversion notice by police. However, the case was later dismissed. In February, Roberts was selected in the Broncos 2017 NRL Auckland Nines squad. In Round 7, Roberts scored a hat trick of tries for Brisbane in their 24 - 22 win against his former club, the Titans, at Suncorp Stadium. On 27 July 2017, Roberts extended his contract with the Broncos to the end of the 2021 season. In Round 26 against the North Queensland Cowboys, Roberts played his 100th NRL career match, scoring a try in the 20-10 victory at 1300SMILES Stadium. Roberts finished the 2017 NRL season as the Broncos highest tryscorer with 18 tries in 26 matches. 2018 During the off-season, Roberts reportedly spent time in a Thailand rehabilitation facility to deal with alcohol and substance abuse. Apparently, he was at the same facility in 2016. After showing good form in the early rounds, Roberts was selected in the New South Wales team for the 2018 State of Origin series. On 6 June 2018, Roberts made his State of Origin debut in Game 1, in which NSW defeated Queensland 22-12 at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Roberts played in all three matches at centre in the Blues 2-1 shield winning series. Roberts finished the 2018 NRL season having played 22 matches and scoring 9 tries for the Broncos. 2019 On 15 February 2019, Roberts represented the Indigenous All Stars as a centre in their 34 - 14 win against the New Zealand Maori All Stars team at AAMI Park. On 29 May 2019, the Brisbane Broncos announced that Roberts had been granted an immediate release on compassionate grounds. Roberts then signed a contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs until the end of the 2021 season. This brought him back under the coaching instruction of Wayne Bennett. Bennett had been head coach of the Broncos throughout Roberts‚Äô three full seasons at that club prior to switching to South Sydney in 2019. On 7 June 2019, Roberts played for South Sydney against the Newcastle Knights in round 13 at ANZ Stadium. South Sydney lost 20-12, however Roberts scored a try in the 8th minute. In round 23, Souths defeated Brisbane Broncos by 22 - 20. In the 13th minute, Roberts was put on report and sinbinned for elbowing the head of former teammate Corey Oates. He was suspended for two games, then returned to play in the qualifying final against arch rival the Sydney Roosters. On 27 September 2019, Roberts missed out on playing in Souths' elimination final loss against Canberra Raiders due to a dislocated thumb suffered the weekend previous when Souths defeated Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. 2020 In round 10 of the 2020 NRL season, Roberts suffered a right pectoral injury in South Sydney's defeat against Newcastle. He was later ruled out for twelve weeks with the injury.

His colleagues in political activity included Henry Hetherington, William Lovett, Thomas Wakley, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, and Thomas Cooper. Early life He was born at Malton, North Yorkshire, on 21 September 1799. His father died when he was only a year old. His mother, who was a Sunday school teacher, taught him to read and write. Around the year of 1811, she returned to domestic service in the household of a clergyman, who had paid for James's schooling and tuitions for a brief period. He had worked there as under-gardener, in the stables and as house- servant, and he read widely. From about 1817 Watson was with his mother in Leeds, where he became a warehouseman. In London Watson was converted to freethought and radicalism by public readings from William Cobbett and Richard Carlile. He spread literature and helped with a subscription on behalf of Carlile. Carlile was sentenced in 1821 to three years' imprisonment for blasphemy, and Watson went up to London in September 1822 to serve as a volunteer assistant in his Water Lane bookshop. In January 1823 Carlile's wife, having completed her own term of imprisonment, took a new shop at 201 Strand, and Watson moved there as a salesman; salesman after salesman was arrested. In February 1823 Watson was charged with selling a copy of Elihu Palmer's Principles of Nature to a police agent, spoke in his own defence, and was sent to Coldbath Fields Prison for a year. In prison he read David Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Johann Lorenz von Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, and developed his anti-Christian and republican opinions. In 1825 he trained as a compositor, and was employed in printing Carlile's The Republican; and went into business on his own. He was in poverty at times, and in 1826 caught cholera. Recovering, he became an Owenite, and in 1828 he was storekeeper of the \\"First Co-operative Trading Association\\" in London, in Red Lion Square. Publisher In 1831 Watson set up as a printer and publisher. He became a champion of the right to free expression of opinion. Julian Hibbert, an admirer, died in January 1834 and left him a legacy, with which Watson enlarged his printing plant. He started by printing the life and works of Tom Paine, and these volumes were followed by Mirabaud's System of Nature and Volney's Ruins. Later he printed Lord Byron's Cain and The Vision of Judgment, Percy Bysshe Shelley's Queen Mab and The Masque of Anarchy, and Clark on the Miracles of Christ. These book were printed, corrected, folded, and sewed by Watson himself, and issued at one shilling or less per volume. He cared for the appearance of his books, on which he lost money. In 1832 Watson was arrested, but escaped imprisonment, for organising a procession and a feast on the day the government had ordained a \\"general fast\\" on account of the cholera epidemic. In February 1833 he was summoned at Bow Street for selling Henry Hetherington's Poor Man's Guardian, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Clerkenwell. His shop was near Bunhill Fields; he then moved first to City Road, and in 1843 to 5 Paul's Alley. He married Eleanor Byerley, on 3 June 1834, and two months later was arrested and imprisoned for six months for having circulated Hetherington's unstamped paper, ironically entitled The Conservative. He had come under the observation of the government as a leader of the meeting of trade unions in April of that, in favour of the action of the Dorchester labourers. This was his last imprisonment, though he continued to issue books banned by the government. Chartist In June 1837 Watson was on the committee appointed to draw up the bills embodying the Chartist demands. He was opposed to the violence of some of the agitators, and, on the other hand, to the overtures made to Whig partisans, whom he denounced. He was averse to \\"peddling away the people's birthright for any mess of cornlaw pottage\\". Watson corresponded with Giuseppe Mazzini, and in 1847 joined his Peoples' International League. In 1848 he was one of the conveners of the first public meeting to congratulate the French Revolution of 1848. Later life An untaxed and absolutely free press became his main object in later years. He died at Burns College, Hamilton Road, Lower Norwood, on 29 November 1874, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. A grey granite obelisk erected by friends commemorated his \\"brave efforts to secure the rights of free speech\\". A photographic portrait was in the Memoir by William James Linton.

Design and development At the request of the French government, Henri Coanda designed a single-seat armoured biplane. The forward fuselage was built as a monocoque shell built up from sheet steel, colloquially known as 'The Bath', at the Filton works. The armoured shell enclosed the engine, fuel tank, oil tank and cockpit, with the pilot's seat being formed from the shaped rear bulkhead. The Clerget 7Z was fully cowled with sheet steel and drove a two-bladed propeller which had a large sheet steel spinner, perforated to allow cooling air to the rotary engine, and an internal sheet steel cone preventing bullet entry through the cooling holes. Staggered biplane main-planes were mounted as far forward as possible to ensure that the centre of pressure maintained the correct position relative to the centre of gravity. The lower main-planes were attached to a framework, leaving a gap between wing root and fuselage. The undercarriage consists of two wheels mounted on struts, with long skids which extended rearwards removing the need for a tail-skid. A feature of the undercarriage requested by the French customer was castering main-wheels allowing cross-wind landings. Attached to the rear end of the armoured tub was a slender rear fuselage which ended with a large balanced rudder, tailplane and elevator. Operational history The sole prototype, given the serial 'No.219', was first flown at Larkhill on 8 May 1914 with a temporary aluminium spinner due to vibration with the steel assembly. The S.S.A. Also flew at Farnborough but was damaged in a heavy landing. After repairs the S.S.A. Was flown again on 25 June 1914 at Filton, by Harry Busteed, but broke an undercarriage bracing wire on landing. Despite the damage and without being repaired, the S.S.A. was delivered to the French customer at the La Brayelle, Douai, works of Breguet for repair on 3 July 1914. When the Douai factory was forced to be evacuated to Villacoublay by the German invasion of France at the start of the First World War, the S.S.A. was not taken along, and no further records of the S.S.A. exists.Bruce 1979, p. 97.

The history of Pakistan Statistical Society traces back to 1947, when Pakistan was created, and was encouraged by the prominent and influential Indian statistician Dr. Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. The foundation of the society in 1947 was encouraged and spearheaded by Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis and Dr. Raziuddin Siddiqui, a mathematical physicist. Dr. Siddiqui served its first president whilst Mahalanobis became its life member. Both Siddiqui and Mahalanobis remained influential members, however after the death of Mahalanobis, Siddiqui's interest dwindled and the society struggled to gain its former prominence and importance. In 1976, the society was disintegrated and had gone inactive and defunct prior. The association was revived in 1995, after about twenty years, through productive and effective efforts led by the country's notable statisticians and with the help of Federal Bureau of Statistics.

Warner said that the date of Simms's enlistment was in doubt and does not mention service with the 42nd Georgia Infantry so he seems not to have had the information the Eichers show on his previous service. Simms commanded his regiment at the Battle of FredericksburgAccording to Warner, 1959, p. 777 and Stanchak, 1986, p. 690, but Sifakis, 1988, p. 596 says the record is unclear on this. and the Battle of Salem Church, where they captured the flag of the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

The regiment went with Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps to the Western Theater and fought in the Chattanooga Campaign and Knoxville Campaign. On November 29, 1863, Simms was wounded at the Battle of Fort Sanders (former Confederate Fort Loudon) at Knoxville, Tennessee. Although the Eichers show Simms as next serving between September 30, 1864 and April 6, 1865 as commander of a brigade in Kershaw's division of the I Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, Warner and Sifakis say he commanded his regiment during the Overland Campaign and Sifakis says he commanded Brigadier General Goode Bryan's old brigade from June 2, 1864, because Goode Bryan relinquished command due to ill health on that date, until April 1865 except for a short period of time in early 1865. In the fall of 1864, Simms was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley in Major General Joseph Brevard Kershaw's division. In command of Goode Bryan's old brigade after Bryan's resignation on September 20, 1864,Eicher, 2001, p. 169 Simms commanded the brigade in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Cedar Creek. During this period, on December 8, 1864, Simms was promoted to brigadier general. Returning from the Shenandoah Valley, Simms served during the Siege of Petersburg that winter. After the Confederates evacuated Richmond, Virginia and Petersburg, Virginia, Simms was captured at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865. Simms was paroled from the Union prisoner of war facility at Fort Warren (Massachusetts) on July 24, 1865. Aftermath Simms returned to Covington, Georgia after the war. He resumed his law practice and served in the Georgia legislature in 1865-1866 and for the term starting in 1877.

What type of thing is baseball?  * Exercise - bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health or wellness. * Game - structured activity, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more concerned with the expression of ideas. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional sports). ** Ball game - game played with a ball. *** Bat-and-ball game - field game played by two teams which alternate between \\"batting\\" and \\"fielding\\" roles. The fielding team defends, so only the batting team may score, but they have equal chances in both roles. * Sport - form of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical fitness and provide entertainment to participants. ** Competitive sport - sport in which one or more participants or teams compete against one another. The one that is the most successful in achieving the objective of the game or sport event is the winner. ** Team sport ‚Äì sport that involves players working together towards a shared objective. ** Recreational sport ‚Äì sport engaged in as a leisure time activity. ** Spectator sport ‚Äì sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches.

The party advocates in favour of establishing a constitution to govern the province of British Columbia. The party registered with Elections BC in September 2010. A leadership election was held in 2011 between Wilf Hanni and Mischa Popoff, in which Hanni was re-confirmed as leader. Following internal party disputes, several members left to join the Individual Rights Party of British Columbia, including Mischa Popoff who became that party's leader. Hanni stepped down in 2013 due to family health issues and Rod Taylor became the interim leader. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson was elected as the party's leader on September 15, 2020. Thompson previously ran as a candidate for the People's Party of Canada in the 2019 Burnaby South federal by- election.  Policies  The party was founded as the British Columbia Heritage Party with the stated objective \\"to restore and preserve our Great Canadian heritage, granted by our Creator, which is the foundation of our democratic system of government, in order to bring effective and accountable government to British Columbia\\". Party leader Wilf Hanni stated that the first priority in a government controlled by the BC Heritage Party would be to implement a six-point plan for democratic reforms, including preferential voting to replace the existing first-past-the-post voting, free votes, holding more referendums, making it easier to recall elected officials and implement citizens initiatives. Their second priority would be to review the tax structure and replace the taxation system so that the government is funded solely through a single rate income tax or a single rate consumption tax (decided in a referendum). The party plans to introduce \\"made-in-BC\\" constitution, with the framework drafted by the party but revised by a citizens' assembly. The BC Heritage Party published, in September 2010, a document of policy positions, including lowering political donation amounts from corporations, unions, individuals to a maximum of $10,000 per year, halt government attempts to combat global warming, implement zero-based budgeting, encourage industrial development of in the Interior, place an export duty on raw logs, seek to build a bridge from the Lower Mainland to Vancouver Island, prohibit unauthorized access to private property for the purposes of mineral exploration, among other policy points. In September 2011, members of the BC Heritage Party voted in favour of seeking to become a provincial wing of the Christian Heritage Party of Canada. The federal Christian Heritage Party agreed and in March 2012 the BC Heritage Party became the Christian Heritage Party of British Columbia. It nominated five candidates in the 2017 provincial election, none of whom was elected.

Early life  Sheridan was born at Castlebar, County Mayo Ireland, the son of Henry S. Sheridan and his wife Margaret, n√©e Martin. He arrived in New South Wales in 1842 and was initially employed near Twofold Bay, where he had the experience of being, on his own account, 'one of the first white men ever seen among the wild tribes'. Subsequently, he was until 1844 employed as a property manager for Captain William Oldrey of Broulee. He married on 18 November 1845, in Sydney, to Adele Eulalie Masse, a native of Mauritius.  Public servant  Sheridan subsequently joined the Customs Department in Sydney in February 1846 but his illness made him be eventually transferred to Moreton Bay (Brisbane) in February 1853, where on 31 May, he became a member of the Steam Navigation Board. He later moved north to take up a position as a sub-collector of customs at Maryborough on 10 December 1859 and subsequently as a Water Police Magistrate and Immigration Agent. He thus held several key positions in the Wide Bay and Maryborough area in the period from 1859 to his retirement in about 1890.  Volunteer roles  In 1873, Sheridan was appointed a foundation trustee and chairman of the Maryborough Botanic Gardens. Sheridan was an honorary lieutenant colonel in the volunteer Queensland Defence Force.  Politics  In the 1883 Queensland elections on 17 August 1883 Sheridan was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Maryborough, where he was an ally of Samuel Griffith. He was a Minister without portfolio from 13 November 1883 to 3 January 1885, after which he became briefly Postmaster-General of Queensland from 3 January 1885 to 17 February 1885. He held the seat until 5 May 1888.  Later life  Sheridan retired to Brisbane but moved to Sydney in 1897, where he died at Manly on 8 June and was buried in Waverley Cemetery in accordance with his Catholic faith.Obituary, Brisbane Courier 9 Jun 1897, page 7f; Queenslander 3 Sep 1904, page 9b; Sheridan was respected for his integrity and deep sense of fairness and humanity, and as such, he remained throughout his life a true pioneer of compassion in regard to the rights of Aboriginal people and always keenly alert to the shady sides of the infamous Melanesian labour trade. He thus protested in public against the Native Police system he would later raise his voice in defence of the rights of Melanesian labourers. In November 1873, he strongly criticised Maryborough hospital for refusing the treatment to a dying Aboriginal.Evidence to the Select Committee into the Native Police Force May 1861; Maryborough Chronicle 5 Feb 1874, page 3a; Maryborough Chronicle 9 Dec & 16 Dec 1876, Extract from the evidence taken by the select committee on Polynesian labour I&II; Q 22 Jul 1876, page 6d; Gympie Times 6 Sep 1876, Editorial; Gympie Times on 7 & 17 Sep, and 7 Oct 1876, Articles on Sheridan and the Kanaka trade.

She married John Leslie, who was the 7th Earl of Rothes and 1st Duke of Rothes, and had two daughters: *Margaret Leslie, 8th Countess of Rothes (d. 20 August 1700), married Charles Hamilton, 5th Earl of Haddington (c. 1650 - 1685), and had issue. *Lady Christian Leslie, married firstly James Graham, 3rd Marquess of Montrose (1657‚Äì1684), and had issue, and secondly Sir John Bruce (before 1671 - 19 March 1710). Anne was a devout Presbyterian, and was well known in her day to have had allegiances with the Covenanters. She would regularly attend field preaching meetings, known as conventicles, and on many occasions would invite Covenanters to Leslie House in Leslie as her guests. Her husband, however, believed strongly in restoring the episcopacy. Serving faithfully under Charles II's government, he was naturally opposed to the Covenanters, but for the sake of his wife he generally tolerated them. If he would see any of them at Leslie House, he would remark to Anne, \\"My lady, I would advise you to keep your chickens in about, else I may pick up some of them.\\" On one occasion, a warrant moved Rothes to conduct a search for any preachers hiding on his estate, and he remarked to his wife, \\"My hawks will be out tonight, my lady, so you had better take care of your blackbirds!\\" As a warning, Anne would signal the Covenanters hiding on their estate by placing a white sheet on one of the trees on a hill just behind Leslie House, which could be seen at quite a distance. The Covenanters would also seek the duchess to exert her influence over her husband and the Privy Council, interceding on their behalf in order to lessen the severity of the punishments that would have been carried out by the officials of the day (one of the most notable repressers being Archbishop Sharp, who was a distant kinsman of the duke of Rothes and on occasion was a guest at Leslie House).

The company operated 234 miles in Maine. Its primary route formed the Canadian Pacific east‚Äìwest main line between Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick. From 1889-1974 part of the through route consisted of trackage rights over the Maine Central Railroad between Mattawamkeag, Maine and Vanceboro, Maine. History The Canadian Pacific Lines in Maine were a conglomeration of routes purchased or built by the Canadian Pacific prior to 1900. Its through route included trackage rights over a segment of line owned by the Maine Central Railroad, which was later purchased outright by the CP. Two major components of the route were: The European and North American Railway, which formed the easternmost connection from Vanceboro, Maine, with Saint John, New Brunswick, in the 1860s. The Canadian portion of this line was absorbed by the New Brunswick Railway, which itself was purchased by the Canadian Pacific in 1890. The American portion of the line was purchased by the Maine Central Railroad (MEC) and operated by that company. The CP exercised trackage rights over the MEC portion of the route, and purchased the line outright from the MEC in 1974. The assets of the New Brunswick Railway was sold, minus the operating rail lines, to businessman K.C. Irving in 1941, who later turned it over to his forest operations subsidiary J.D. Irving Limited. In 1988, citing declining traffic, the CP set up a subsidiary to control its lines east of Montreal, the Canadian Atlantic Railway. Between 1988 and 1993, many CAR lines were abandoned. In December 1994 all remaining CAR assets were sold. Some portions of the original New Brunswick Railway's rail lines were purchased by J.D. Irving Limited, which continues to operate them as the New Brunswick Southern Railway. Some former NBR trackage in Grand Falls is now owned and operated by the Canadian National Railway. As a surprise to some, in November 2019 Canadian Pacific announced the purchase of the Central Maine and Quebec Railway, the current owner of the former Canadian Pacific Lines in Maine from outside Montreal to Brownville Junction, ME. This move thus returns ownership of approximately half of the CP lines in Maine, as well as a portion of Bangor & Aroostook lines spanning from Millinocket, ME to Searsport, ME. The reasoning for CP's return according to their press release was to (re)establish a port connection at Saint John, NB, Canada via commercial rights over the NBR lines as well as a new connect to the port of Searsport, ME The International Railway of Maine was designed to connect the CP's lines in Canada with the European and North American Railway at Mattawamkeag. Planning for the line started in 1871 and the route was purchased by CP subsidiary Atlantic and Northwest in 1886. The CP finished various uncompleted portions of the Montreal-Saint John through route under Chief Engineer James Ross in the late 1880s, opening the line in June 1889. In addition to the Montreal-Saint John through route, the Canadian Pacific's lines in Maine also included a branch in the Aroostook River valley from Fort Fairfield, Maine to Presque Isle, Maine (27 miles) where they connected with CP subsidiary Aroostook Valley Railroad and competitor Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, as well as a branch that connected Debec, New Brunswick with Houlton, Maine (8 miles).RAILROADING IN MAINE.

He was several times imprisoned for provocative agitation against the government. Early life He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1783, and was then described as born on 16 October 1769. By profession he was a surgeon and apothecary, having been trained by William North, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons practising at Chelsea. It is questionable whether he was fully qualified as a physician; and Charles Roach Smith wrote that his political advocacy ruined his professional prospects. Activist Jones was a member of the London Corresponding Society. He spoke effectively at the British and Westminster forums, and publicly supported the progress of the French Revolution. In James Gillray's caricature of the public meeting held at Copenhagen Fields on 12 November 1795, Jones is shown on the hustings to the left; and at the other meetings of that body he was one of the chief declaimers. James Gillray's cartoon, Jones speaking (left side) at Copenhagen Fields on 12 November 1795. On 11 March 1796 in that year he, and John Binns delivered lectures, as delegates from the London Corresponding Society, in Birmingham; but the meeting was broken up. Next year (9 April 1797) Jones was tried at Warwick before Justice Nash Grose, and, although defended by Samuel Romilly and Felix Vaughan, was convicted on one count, the seditious expression \\"that he was sent to know whether the people of Birmingham would submit to the Treason and Sedition Bills\\". Early in 1810 Charles Philip Yorke insisted on the exclusion of strangers from the House of Commons during the debates on the Walcheren expedition. After a debate on this proceeding in the British forum, the result condemning Yorke was announced outside the building in a placard drawn up by Jones. Yorke brought the matter before the House of Commons as a breach of privilege (19 February 1810), and Jones was ordered to attend the house. He acknowledged the authorship, was voted guilty, and committed to Newgate Prison, where he remained until 21 June, when the House of Commons rose. He declined to recognise the legality of his restraint or to petition for his release, and was, it is said, only got out at last by a stratagem. During his imprisonment, Francis Burdett, Romilly, and Sir James Hall made motions for his release, but they were all unsuccessful, although in Romilly's case the majority was only 160 to 112. A letter which Burdett wrote on Jones's treatment led to his committal to Newgate. In this same year, 26 November 1810, Jones was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, and ordered to provide sureties to keep the peace for three years, for a libel on Lord Castlereagh. The rumour that he was ill-treated in this prison was found, on the investigation of Coleridge and Daniel Stuart, to be groundless. Later life At the Westminster elections of 1818 and 1820 he exerted himself, but he took little further part in politics. He died at Somers Town on 4 April 1838. His portrait was engraved and published by P. Brown, of 4 Crown Street, Soho, on 14 March 1798. Works About 1798 he published Observations on the Tussis Convulsiva, or Hoopping-cough, as read at the Lyceum Medicum Londinense. In 1796 he published Sketch of a Political Tour through Rochester, Chatham, Maidstone, and Gravesend.

The show follows a group of political campaign staffers working to elect a dark horse candidate to the U.S. Senate in the battleground state of Wisconsin. Walsh serves as executive producer alongside Hagai Shaham and Marc Webb. The show marks Hulu's first foray into original scripted programming. It premiered online on February 14, 2012. In December 2017, it was announced that the series was being revived as a podcast by UK 3's The World At Large series. The first three episodes of season two were made available on iTunes on December 3, 2017. Overview The series chronicles the inner workings of a Democratic Party candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin. Led by campaign manager Chris \\"Tak\\" Davis, the team battles against corrupt politicians and staff infighting while campaigning for a distant third-place candidate. Main Cast and characters *Jay Hayden as Chris \\"Tak\\" Davis, Campaign Manager *Teri Reeves as Kara \\"KJ\\" Jamison, Communications Director *Jack DeSena as Cole Graner, Speechwriter *Ben Samuel as Ben Werner, campaign intern *Lindsey Payne as Lindsey Cutter, campaign volunteer *Jordan T. Maxwell as Jordan T. Mosley, the candidate's step-son *Alison Haislip as Ali Laurents, Social Media Director *Meighan Gerachis as Deirdre Samuels, the candidate Production In October 2010, Fox gave a script commitment to the series, which was being written by J. D. Walsh and executive-produced by Walsh and Marc Webb. Fox later passed on making the show. Walsh shot a 20-minute pilot funded by family members. He said no television network was willing to air the series due to its politics-related theme. Hulu later stepped in to produce the series. Battleground is set in Wisconsin, the childhood home of long-time friends Walsh and Webb. Walsh has also worked for Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in a previous political campaign. In a press release, he said: \\"People hate politics but they love elections. Campaigns are about good versus evil, our team versus yours, relationships, temptations, power, unimaginable triumphs and heartbreaking defeats. I‚Äôm interested in the people behind the people.\\" The first season was filmed in Walsh's hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, with sets ranging from local homes to a local elementary school. Walsh said he chose to film in Madison instead of Los Angeles because he had a better feel for the people, places and politics and there was a \\"sense of excitement\\" among the locals to be a part of the project. As many as 90 local actors were cast. Local WKOW anchors Greg Jeschke and Sabrina Hall appeared in a fake broadcast. To stage large crowds, real-life scenes of fans heading to a University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison football game were used. Walsh calls the show \\"a love letter to Madison\\". Episodes Television: Season 1 (2012) The first season consists of 13 episodes. The series premiere was made available online on February 14, 2012. New episodes were made available each subsequent week on Hulu. Podcast: Season 2 (2017-18) Broadcast In its first ever appearance at the Television Critics Association (TCA) press tour on January 15, 2012, Internet streaming site Hulu announced that it will be airing the series online. Hulu's senior vice president of content Andy Forssell said the site picked up the series because it \\"saw a spark\\" and \\"[w]e see what J.D. [Walsh] sees in it and we know the audience is there.\\" Battleground is Hulu's first original scripted series. The series, along with Hulu's other original documentary series, is available for free rather than on the subscription-based Hulu Plus to enable the site to build its user base and reputation for original programming. The show premiered on February 14, 2012, with a new episode made available online each subsequent week. Reception Battlegrounds first episode received mixed to positive reviews, with critics noting its relatively low production value but strong writing. The Associated Press's Jake Coyle described the show as a \\"light, watered-down knockoff of The Office\\" that comes off like a \\"student fantasy of playful politics.\\" David Hinckley of the Daily News said the show \\"parlays [a solid professional cast] into some good jokes, political and otherwise\\" but viewers \\"should not expect that ... the look of the show will match what they see on broadcast or cable.\\" Dean Robbins of local newspaper Isthmus called the first episode worthy of comparison to sophisticated modern sitcoms, saying it \\"distinguishes itself with strong writing and acting, not to mention a distinctive setting.\\" References External links *Battleground at Hulu * Category:2010s American comedy-drama television series Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:Hulu original programming Category:Television shows set in Wisconsin Category:2010s American political television series Category:American mockumentary television series Category:Political web series Category:American comedy web series Category:Political mockumentaries Category:American satirical websites ","title":"Battleground (TV series)"},{"id":"34407197","text":"EosXi in flight EosXi The Nimbus EosXi is an Italian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for civilian use, developed and manufactured by NIMBUS Srl.Il drone ultraleggero, Panorama, January 13, 2012Tre UAV nello spazio aereo civile, un record europeo , FINMECCANICA, September 30, 2011 EOS XI is a hybrid airship having a large, gas-filled delta wing which provides both aerostatic and aerodynamic lift, referred to by the manufacturer as a \\"metaplane\\". The cabin, tail assembly and propulsion system are suspended below the wing. Description Although classified as an aerodyne (an aircraft heavier than air), the additional aerostatic lift allows extremely short take-off and landing (STOL) distances. Unlike conventional aircraft, which use adjustable control surfaces known as ailerons to maneuver in flight, the EosXi wing is a stiff structure with no moving parts. The craft uses only the suspended tail assembly's moveable planes for course and attitude control, relying on the wing's aerostatic lift to enhance stability. The large wing has a low wing loading that contributes to the vehicle's STOL characteristics. The wing envelope has a multi-layer construction to obtain the required lightness, strength and aerodynamic characteristics.E.Cafaro, L.Stantero, R.Taurino, A.Capuani, A. Mercalli, S.

Online piracy is the practice of downloading and distributing copyrighted content digitally without permission, such as music or software. The principle behind piracy has predated the creation of the Internet, but its online popularity arose alongside the internet. Despite its explicit illegality in many developed countries, online piracy is still widely done by many users due to many ethical reasons and its ease of use has only gotten better as technology advances. History The act of copying content without authorization goes back to when Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited the Sistine Chapel at the age of 14 and heard Allegri's Miserere being performed. The piece's sheet-music was only authorized to be owned by three people: Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, John V of Portugal, and Giovanni Battista Martini. After having heard it once Mozart went back to his hotel and transcribed the entire piece from memory, coming back again two days later to proofread the transcription against the performance. In the months following his transcription's publication, Mozart's fame for the act had gotten so high that Pope Clement XIV summoned him to Rome in order to grant him papal knighthood. LimeWire's paid version of their app was frequently acquired by users using the free version Nathan Fisk traces the origins of modern online piracy back to similar problems posed by the advent of the printing press. Quoting from legal standards in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., he notes that there have historically been a number of technologies which have had a \\"dual effect\\" of facilitating legitimate sharing of information, but which also facilitate the ease with which copyright can be violated. He likens online piracy to issues faced in the early 20th century by stationers in England, who tried and failed to prevent the large scale printing and distribution of illicit sheet music. The release of Napster in 1999 caused a rapid upsurge in online piracy of music, films and television, though it always maintained a focus on music in the .MP3 format. It allowed user to share content via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and was one of the first mainstream uses of this distribution methods as it made it easy for regular users to get free music. Napster's popular use would only be short lived as on July 27, 2000, it was ordered to be shut down by a federal judge; it was officially shut down July 11, 2001 in order to comply with the order and the case was officially settled on September 24, 2001. Although it was short- lived, Napster's reign allowed its users to dive into the grey-area of content piracy. Following its shutdown, many other popular P2P file sharing programs arose: the creation and usage of Limewire quickly followed suit. Learning from the mistakes of Napster, Limewire decentralized their servers by implmenting the BitTorrent protocol on the Gnutella network. The success of the BitTorrent communication protocol led to the rise of many other popular programs that are still widely used today including ŒºTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, QBittorrent, and Tixati. Digital piracy as a continuing problem significantly impacts various stakeholders, including consumers, enterprises, and countries. This global problem can impact media and content-oriented industries. Kos Koklic, M., Kukar-Kinney, M. & Vida, I. Three-Level Mechanism of Consumer Digital Piracy: Development and Cross-Cultural Validation. J Bus Ethics 134, 15‚Äì27 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-014-2075-1 Scope The economic loss caused by digital piracy before the year 2000 is estimated to be worth $265B and in 2004 it was found that 4% of box office receipts were lost. Both piracy and economic losses due to piracy are both trending upwards. Digital piracy has taken the spotlight. Lost revenues due to digital piracy could reach $5 billion by the end of 2005.

Belleflamme, Paul and Peitz, Martin, Digital Piracy: Theory (October 27, 2010). CESifo Working Paper Series No. 3222. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1698618 In a 2014 research study, the economic and technological factors were examined within 12 indicators, resulting in that on average, most research respondents agreed that the reason why they keep participating in the unethical doing of digital piracy is it widely spread influence by economic and technological factors.Wulandari, Hesty (2014) Economy and technology as influential factors for digital piracy sustainability: An Indonesian case. In: International Conference on Accounting Studies (ICAS) 2014, 18 - 19 August 2014, Putra World Trade Centre, Kuala Lumpur. The groups and individuals who operate piracy websites potentially earn millions of dollars from their efforts. This revenue can come from a number of sources, such as advertising, subscriptions, and the sale of content. Piracy behavior demonstrated that economic theory explains a notable part of the individual variation in a survey study. Individuals with a low net valuation of an original when a copy is available are more prone to engage in piracy than individuals with a higher valuation. Individuals with a low cost of obtaining and handling copies are also more engaged in piracy. The country-wise variation can also be explained by economic variables; GNI/capita and judicial efficiency explain a substantial part of this variation. Holm, H. J. (2003). Can economic theory explain piracy behavior?, The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, 3(1). doi: https://doi.org/10.2202/1538-0653.1082 While these sites are occasionally shut down, they are often quickly replaced, and may move through successive national legal jurisdictions to avoid law enforcement. These efforts at detection and enforcement are further complicated by the often prohibitive amount of time, resources and personnel required. Some jurisdictions, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have no legislation in place to address online piracy, and others, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, have oversight regimes in place that have proven largely ineffective.  Benefits  Online piracy has led to improvements into file sharing technology that has bettered information distribution as a whole. Additionally, pirating communities tend to model market trends well, as members of those communities tend to be early adopters. Piracy can also lead to businesses developing new models that better account for the current market. It has been argued that online piracy may help in preventing businesses from investing in unnecessary marketing campaigns. In addition to helping screen businesses, research proposes that some organizations may be better off servicing only their most valued and legitimate customers, or those who buy legitimate copies of their products. Because pirated copies of software are expected to attract customers who are sensitive to price, it may not be to businesses‚Äô best interest to engage in extraneous price wars with their competitors or invest heavily in anti-piracy campaigns to win target customers.Haruvy, E. , Mahajan, V. and Prasad, A. (2004), ‚ÄúThe effect of piracy on the market penetration of subscription software‚Äù, Journal of Business, Vol. 77 No. 2, pp. 81-107. Despite the discourse on the digital threat of piracy, it has been shown that innovation and the creation of new works is flourishing more than ever on the internet despite the digital threat discourse.Frosio, G. F. (2016). Digital piracy debunked: a short note on digital threats and intermediary liability. Internet Policy Review, 5(1). DOI: 10.14763/2016.1.400 Piracy has also benefitted users in countries where content is either unavailable or delayed. In the case of ABC's Lost, the fear of its last episode being pirated in European and Middle-Eastern countries pushed the network to accelerate the episode's distribution to those countries, resulting in the episode being available in those countries 24/48 hours after the original American broadcast.  Ethics  The laws on copyright protection are clear and the penalties are heavy. The prevalence of piracy in face of these potential penalties is due to the fact that individuals do not see piracy as inappropriate let alone illegal, instead viewing it as ethically acceptable due to the core execution of piracy being that it creates a copy of the file, thus nothing tangible is being taken away from the original owner.M. Limayem, M. Khalifa and W. W. Chin, \\"Factors motivating software piracy: a longitudinal study,\\" in IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, vol. 51, no. 4, pp. 414-425, Nov. 2004. doi: 10.1109/TEM.2004.835087 Additionally, despite the massive realm of copying and sharing digital content, consumers who pirate are more willing to pay for legal content when the content is consumer friendly.P. D. M. Fetscherin and P. D. C. Lattemann, \\"Motives and Willingness to Pay for Digital Music,\\" Third International Conference on Automated Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-Channel Distribution (AXMEDIS'07), Barcelona, 2007, pp. 189-196. doi: 10.1109/AXMEDIS.2007.41 A person's ethical and moral predispositions and the judgments that they use to make decisions may indicate consistency across various ethical dilemmas and also indicate their likelihood to pirate software.Wagner, S.C., Sanders, G.L. Considerations in Ethical Decision-Making and Software Piracy. Journal of Business Ethics 29, 161‚Äì167 (2001). https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1006415514200 Conversely, those same individuals cited that the prevalence of piracy is due to the industry's inability to cater to the consumer. Many cite unsatisfactory industry practices such as obtrusive DRM in paid software, overpriced media, and split markets as their reason for pirating. Digital piracy has posed a significant threat to the development of the software industry and the growth of the digital media industry, it has, for the last decade, held considerable interest for researchers and practitioners. Yoon, C. Theory of Planned Behavior and Ethics Theory in Digital Piracy: An Integrated Model. J Bus Ethics 100, 405‚Äì417 (2011). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-010-0687-7 In the context of Indonesia, moral equity has affected digital piracy behavior negatively. Therefore, efforts to reduce piracy have been focused on highlighting the importance of fairness and justice. Arli, D., Tjiptono, F. and Porto, R. (2015), \\"The impact of moral equity, relativism and attitude on individuals‚Äô digital piracy behaviour in a developing country\\", Marketing Intelligence & Planning, Vol. 33 No. 3, pp. 348-365. https://doi.org/10.1108/MIP-09-2013-0149 Studying the causes and effects of digital piracy is one way of evaluating the ethics of how our society consumes and spreads media to one another. Ample research in the study of digital piracy can help better understand the psychology and ethics of digital ethics. One of the research approaches that has provided a theoretical framework for studying software piracy has been to place the illegal copying of software within the domain of ethical decision making assumes that a user must be able to recognize software piracy as a moral issue. A person who cannot recognize a moral issue will fail to use moral decision-making schemata. There is evidence that many individuals do not perceive software piracy to be an ethical problem.Glass, R.S., Wood, W.A. Situational determinants of software piracy: An equity theory perspective. J Bus Ethics 15, 1189‚Äì1198 (1996). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00412817 Research findings suggested that personal morals decrease digital piracy mainly in the first phase, whereas neutralization is used by individuals to support their behavior throughout other phases.Mathupayas Thongmak, \\"Ethics, neutralization, and digital piracy\\", International Journal of Electronic Commerce Studies, Vol.8, No.1, pp.1-24, 2017. As more content is fractured into different services, consumers gravitate more towards piracy due to the inconvenience of managing multiple service subscriptions due to differing content being owned by different entities that provide their own content service such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, and the recently released Disney+.

This was further broken down to Main line 558.87 miles and 194.87 miles of yard track and sidings. The Southern Pacific Company gained Interstate Commerce Commission approval to control the Cotton Belt system on April 14, 1932 but continued to operate it as a separate company until 1992, when the SP consolidated the Cotton Belt's operations into the parent company. During its years of operation, the revenues from operations in Texas generated more than $1 million per year, qualifying the line as a Class I railroad by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas was leased to its corporate parent on March 1, 1954. See also *St. Louis Southwestern Railway References *Lewis, Robert G. Handbook of American Railroads.

The company operated of railway in Vermont. History The CP's lines in Vermont were composed of the former Newport and Richford Railroad, leased to the Canadian Pacific in 1881, along with of former Boston and Maine trackage from Newport to Wells River. A portion of the route between Newport and Richford enters the Canadian province of Quebec. The Newport-Wells River, in conjunction with the Boston and Maine, served as a through route between Montreal, Quebec, and Boston, Massachusetts. The CP, together with the B&M;, operated a day passenger train, the Alouette, and a night passenger train, the Red Wing, over this route. The Vermont lines did not connect with another CP subsidiary in the United States, the Canadian Pacific Lines in Maine. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the company reported financial losses for a few years, in contrast to other Canadian-owned lines in the U.S. In 1950, the freight revenue from this line was $1.9 million, with an additional $162,000 in passenger receipts, qualifying it as a Class I railroad in the United States. Service came to a temporary halt on Friday August 27, 1966, when sixteen trade unions in Canada stopped work in a nationwide strike action to demand higher pay rates. Parliament put forth a back-to-work bill the following Monday, and union leaders opted to honor the Parliament's request, officially ending the strike on September 2 (although some scattered railroad workers still refused to return to work, and many local union chapters enacted a work slowdown action). Vermont filed an opposition to the B&M; sale to Guilford Transportation in 1981 citing the potential for predatory competition to CP and the Lamoille Valley Railroad.

They were launched in 2012. At 2015 the NIAs covered 47,000 acres of England in total, achieved at a total cost of ¬£7.5 million. At spring 2015 the NIAs had also added a further 13,500 acres beyond the initial 2012 areas, as well as a total of 335 miles of new footpaths for public access. History The NIAs form part of the UK Government's response to Sir John Lawton's 2010 report \\"Making Space for Nature\\". They were then implemented via the Natural Environment White Paper, the first natural environment government White Paper in 20 years. In October 2011 a competition was launched by DEFRA to select twelve pilot sites for NIAs, and in response seventy-six entries were made. On 27 February 2012 the final list of 12 Nature Improvement Areas was announced. The NIAs were launched in 2012 they run with the aid of Local Nature Partnerships and around 11,000 local volunteers. List of Nature Improvement Areas The first twelve Nature Improvement Areas in England are: ; Birmingham and Black Country Living Landscapes : Includes urban, wetland, river and heath habitats. It will create heathland on brownfield sites and 40 hectares of new native woodland; ; Dark Peak : Includes moorland and woodland in the north of the Peak District National Park. It will restore habitats such as upland heathland and create 210 hectares of native woodland, such as that at Burbage Brook; ; Dearne Valley Green Heart : Mostly on farmland and former mining settlements with woodland and wetland. It will restore the River Don floodplain and create new wetlands and woodlands ; Greater Thames Marshes : Includes agricultural marsh and urban habitats. It will create and enhance grazing marsh, salt marsh and mudflat habitats; ; Humberhead Levels : Straddling Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, it is mainly wetland, lowland and peat habitats. It will create or restore at least 1,427 hectares of wetland habitat; ; Marlborough Downs : This is predominantly a farmer-led partnership looking to restore chalk and grassland habitats and increase the numbers of farmland birds as well as creating a network of traditional clay- lined dewponds to act as wildlife havens; ; Meres and Mosses of the Marches : Incorporates wetlands, peat bogs and ponds in Cheshire. It will aim to reduce diffuse pollution by working with farmers, improve peatlands and restore wildlife areas around the River Perry; ; Morecambe Bay Limestones and Wetlands : The most northerly NIA, this consists of limestone, wetland and grassland habitats. It will restore coast and freshwater wetlands and create 200 hectares of woodland, planting 10,000 native trees and develop habitat for six species; ; Nene Valley : Within the River Nene regional park, this project will work with farmers to restore habitats and restore tributaries and reaches of the River Nene; ; Northern Devon : This incorporates river, woodland and grassland. The project will recreate and restore 1,000 hectares of priority habitat and restore the much wider catchment area of the River Torridge so that it can support the critically endangered freshwater pearl mussel; ; South Downs Way Ahead : Encompasses key chalk sites of the South Downs National Park. The NIA will restore 1,000 hectares of chalk grassland and encourage the return of the Duke of Burgundy butterfly and several species of farmland birds; and ; Wild Purbeck : Purbeck a variety of river, wetland, heath and woodland habitat as well as the largest onshore oil field in Western Europe. This NIA will introduce livestock to manage heathland, restore wetland and create or restore 15 ponds as well as creating 120 hectares of new woodland and a new seven hectare saline lagoon.

He has received numerous international awards for his reporting. In 2000, the International Press Institute named him one of its World Press Freedom Heroes. Background M'membe was born in Mongu, Barotseland on 11 March 1959. He went to St John's Secondary School, where he did his junior secondary, and later went to St Francis in Malole where he completed his senior secondary. He studied accounting at the Copperbelt University. He worked for a time as an accountant before moving into journalism in November 1990. He is also a qualified member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and has a Master in Economic Policy and Planning from the University of Zambia. He also holds a law degree from the University of Zambia and is an advocate of the High Court and Supreme Court of Zambia. He met Mike Hall, a Malawi-born journalist who covered Southern Africa for the BBC and UK and US newspapers. At the time, Zambia had only two newspapers, both of them controlled by the government of Kenneth Kaunda, and the pair felt that an independent news source was long overdue. With Hall's help, M'membe went on to found Post Newspapers Limited in 1991, as well as a printing company, Independent Printers Limited, which would be responsible for printing The Zambia Post, Post Newspapers' flagship publication. The pair modelled the paper's design on South Africa's liberal Weekly Mail and Lisbon, Portugal's daily P√∫blico. Despite a modest circulation of 40,000 and Zambia's \\"anemic\\" economy, the paper quickly proved a financial success. Chiluba era As the only independent newspaper in Zambia, The Post has frequently come into conflict with the government. In the first ten years of its existence alone, it was the target of more than fifty criminal and civil suits. Though the paper supported Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in the 1991 election that ousted Kenneth Kaunda and won Chiluba the presidency, M'membe soon became critical of what he perceived as Chiluba's failure to live up to his campaign promises. Ahead of the 1996 general election, Chiluba's government increased its efforts to restrict independent media. On 5 February 1996, The Post reported the MMD's plans to hold a referendum on constitutional changes. Chiluba's government banned the edition and charged M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape, and special projects editor Masautso Phiri with possession of a banned publication and state secrets, causing the three to go into hiding for several weeks to avoid arrest. M'membe and Mwape surrendered to authorities in March and were sentenced to 24 days in a maximum security prison on charges of contempt of Parliament. The charges were protested by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which launched a letter-writing campaign to secure the pair's release. In 1999, M'membe and ten members of his staff were charged with espionage following a Post article that stated that Zambia was unprepared to withstand a possible military attack from Angola. The newspaper's offices were also surrounded by police to prevent further publishing. M'membe's co- defendants were acquitted by the Lusaka High Court on 18 August 2000, though the judge ruled that M'membe himself still had to answer the case. He was acquitted in December of the same year. In August 2001, M'membe was arrested again following an article in which he accused Chiluba of embezzlement. The article began, \\"It's very difficult to avoid calling President Frederick Chiluba a thief, because he is a thief. How else can one describe a person who steals?\\" M'membe was charged with defaming the president, charges The New York Times described as \\"efforts to muzzle the press\\" ahead of impending elections. Post-Chiluba controversies Though Chiluba was barred by the Constitution of Zambia from seeking a third term, he was succeeded by his former vice- president and fellow MMD member Levy Mwanawasa. M'membe soon found himself in conflict with Mwanawasa as he had been with Chiluba, and was arrested on 12 February 2002 on defamation charges following publication of an article in which he quoted opposition lawmaker Dipak Patel as calling Mwanawasa a \\"cabbage,\\" an apparent reference to Mwanawasa's condition following a serious traffic accident that left him with slurred speech. M'membe stated that he believed the charges to be \\"politically motivated\\", and that Patel (who was also issued a summons) was their primary target. During a June 2009 hospital strike, Post News Editor Chansa Kabwela forwarded to Vice-President George Kunda pictures that had been given to the newspaper of a woman giving birth in the street, which she felt were important to share but too graphic to publish. The following month, she was arrested on a charge of \\"distributing obscene materials in order to corrupt the morals of society\\". The charges against her were dismissed by a judge in November 2009, but after M'membe published an op- ed piece from a Zambian lawyer living abroad in Kabwela's support, he was charged with contempt of court. He was convicted in June 2010 and sentenced to four months' hard labour. In July 2011, M'membe again faced a charge of contempt of court for defying a ban not to print \\"libelous\\" articles about presidential candidate (later president) Rupiah Banda. On 1 November 2016, the Post newspaper was placed under provisional liquidation after five former employees applied to court to have the company placed on liquidation in order to recover their terminal benefits. According to documents filed in Court, the five former employees did not give the Post the statutory 21 day notice before a Petition for liquidation can be filed. Documents filed in Court also show that an offer was made by M'membe to pay the monies demanded by the former employees into court which offer has not been accepted. The newspaper was instrumental in covering the pre and post 2016 election irregularities and this is cited as one of the reasons why the newspaper was shut down. The Zambia Revenue Authority in June 2016 illegally closed the Post in contravention of an Order of the Tax Appeals Tribunal in move clearly intended to shut down the critical voice. On 14 February 2017, saint Valentine's Day, the Magistrate's Court of Zambia issued an arrest warrant to the Zambia Police Service to arrest Mr. Fred M'membe and his lawyer Nchima Nchito for alleged 'personation' for fighting to save the Post. Nchima's arrest warrant was quashed by the Court on 28 February 2017. As police reached Mr. M'membe's residence, he was absent and only his wife (daughter of the late opposition UPND leader Anderson Mazoka) was present. Mrs M'membe was arrested in what is seen as a frustrated attempt to save face by the Police and is currently facing criminal charges. Mrs. M'membe is the proprietor of Mast Newspaper which after the closure of the Post has remained one of the few critical and independent voices providing checks and balances to what is seen as a growing intolerant political environment. Recognition M'membe was the third recipient of the Media Institute of Southern Africa's Press Freedom Award in 1995. MISA described him as \\"the most persecuted journalist in his country and the rest of the region.\\" Previous awardees include Onesimo Makani Kabweza and Basildon Peta. In 1995, M'membe won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In 2000, he was selected by the International Press Institute as one of 50 \\"World Press Freedom Heroes\\" of the organisation's fifty years of existence.

While these natives had little more than \\"digging sticks\\" called mattocks instead of ploughs at their disposal, Siberian agriculture would develop through the centuries until millions of Russian farmers were settled there, reaping significant bounties off this huge expanse of land stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.  The effect of climate and geography on agriculture  Agriculture is inevitably tied up with climate, as Siberia's is not the most forgiving or lenient. Siberia does not get warmth from the Atlantic Ocean because of the barriers of Europe and the Ural Mountains, or from the warmer climes of Central Asia because of the mountains to its south and the mountains of the Russian Far East. Therefore, the only side of Siberia which is not blocked off by a geographical barrier is the north, opening up the area to the bitter cold of the Arctic Ocean. To add to these agricultural disadvantages, most of Siberia's soil is acidic podsol, which is not a good match for agriculture. However, there are rich, fertile black earth belts in the southwest (known as chernozem), as well as scattered pockets of rich land in other parts of southern Siberia. Despite the many drawbacks for cultivating Siberia lands, there exists a multitude of rivers and lakes that can be put to use for irrigation. In terms of geographical location, there are two main agricultural centers in the fertile areas of Western Siberia, one being near the Urals in the Tobolsky District and the other located on the upper Ob River around the city of Tomsk. Despite the much more favorable conditions that prevail in these western parts, there do exist, however, pockets of suitable farming lands to the east. All of these combined areas were fertile enough, in fact, to necessitate the \\"Siberian tariff\\" of 1897, which was an increased rate on transport of butter and grain by rail to European Russia. This measure, which lasted until 1913, was enacted in order to protect European Russian farmers from the very cheap Siberian agricultural goods flooding in from the newly built Trans-Siberian Railway (which had decreased the price of shipping from Siberia by 5-6 times). Therefore, while the climate and geography posed difficulties for the Siberian farmer, there was still agricultural success to be had in the region.  Pre-modern beginnings  The Neolithic period (8,000-7,000 BCE) is often taken to signify the start of land cultivation. However, the native peoples living in Siberia at that moment in history did not join in this global movement because of the difficulties associated with its severe climate. Agricultural stirrings did reach Siberia by the second half of the 3rd millennium, when the peoples of the Afanasevo culture of southern Siberia (located, more specifically, in the southern reaches of the Ob River), started to practice agronomy. It was a slow start, however, as these peoples had very rudimentary cultivation skills. They used digging sticks (the previously mentioned mattocks) as their main farming tool, and they were not able to subsist solely on this practice and turned as well toward hunting, gathering, and the domestication of sheep, cows, and horses. Siberian steppe in Tatarsky, Novosibirskaya Oblast Only during the Bronze Age, with the advent of bronze scythes, were Siberians able to reach the same agricultural level as had already been achieved in many other areas of the world. This occurred with the rise of the Andronovo culture that inhabited the area between the Tobol River and the Minusinsk Basin. These peoples were sedentary wheat farmers who engaged in barter with the Chinese people to the southeast of their lands, along the periphery of what was to later become Siberia. Siberian agriculture made even more headway during the Tagar culture of the 7th to 2nd centuries BCE, whose peoples lived in the Minusinsk Basin in the upper part of the Yenisei River and introduced the practice of irrigation to the region, signifying a major step forward in terms of increased output from agricultural pursuits. The plough was finally adopted during the first independent Siberian state, the Kirghiz Khanate. This state arose during the 8th century AD, also along the Yenisei River, but adopted a larger range than the Tagar culture, stretching from Krasnoyarsk in the north to the Sayan Mountains in the south. While the economy of the peoples living in this area was based on nomadic cattle breeding, they also engaged in arable farming. The chief crops cultivated during this time included millet, barley, wheat, and hemp.  Early Russian settlers in Siberia  The first step to opening up Siberia for Russian settlement and colonization came as early as 1558, when the wealthy landowner Grigory Dmitriyevich Stroganov received a charter from tsar Ivan the Terrible that gave him the right to colonize the \\"empty lands\\" beyond the Urals (that were already inhabited by the native tribes of Siberia). He was given the right to bring in settlers to these areas and plough their lands. This colonization through land expropriation happened largely in gradual west-to-east steps, aided by the many rivers and river valleys that flow through Siberia. Russian settlers started in the westernmost valleys of the Tura, Tobol, Irtysh, and Ob rivers, and marched onwards to the Ket, Yenisei, Angara, Ilim, Lena, Shilka, Argun, and Amur rivers. Beginning in the 1620s, the area around Yeniseysk in Central Siberia was introduced to cultivation, as were the lands adjacent to Krasnoyarsk in the 1630s. The soil of the latter area was more attractive to settlers because of it was made of rich, black-earth (chernozem), much more conducive to farming than the other poor Siberian soil types. A few decades later, the Upper Lena and Upper Angara River Basins became the site for agriculture, mainly rye, oats, and barley. These areas were more remote and did not have the fertile earth that Krasnoyarsk laid claim to, but food production was crucially needed as more and more settlers started to flow into Siberia. By the late 1600s, Russian settlers started making the long trek to Siberia in greater numbers in order to find new opportunities and lands to claim, away from the densely populated tracts of European Russia. In fact, some peasants chose to move away from their western homes because of poor soil conditions in their native regions, hoping to settle down on some of the chernozem soil that Siberia had to offer. Families also had the chance to improve their standing in society and escape poverty by taking advantage of the more lenient taxing system the Tsar offered in Siberia; for each acre of land that a family tilled for the tsar, they were given permission to plough five acres of government land for their own benefit. In addition to this, early settlers enjoyed a 10-year tax exemption, an incentive for families to migrate eastward. These settlers brought many of their traditional Russian crops with them. The most important of these crops was rye, but they also brought other grains such as barley, wheat, buckwheat, and millet along with vegetables like peas, cabbage, turnips, carrots, onions, and garlic. Like the natives of the Kirghiz Khanate before them, all this Russian crop cultivation was done by plough. The climate of Siberia is not conducive for agriculture, but Siberia during this time was in fact slowly becoming self-reliant. The Siberian Office was therefore gradually able to reduce the amount of food imported to Siberia from European Russia. This was great news for the Russian Imperial government, seeing as the price of shipping such staples as grain those enormous distances was both exorbitantly expensive and slow. As the wave of Russian settlement crept ever eastward, agricultural success became less and less guaranteed. By the 1730s, this east- west journey had finally reached the Kamchatka Peninsula. The aim was to pursue agriculture just as previous settlers had done in the west, but the climate of this peninsula is extremely inhospitable and these pursuits were unsuccessful. However, there were scattered pockets which could produce grain in the eastern regions of Siberia, like Irkutsk, which grew to be one of the most influential cities east of the Urals. In contrast with other east Siberian cities, Irkutsk residents never experienced periods of hunger and did not have to rely on shipments of grain from the west to survive.  Fur vs. agriculture  During this agricultural progression from east to west, settlers did not encounter the empty lands that Tsar Ivan the Terrible and Grigori Stroganov had been expecting. There were already Russian tracks on the land, marks of the indefatigable fur trade of the 1600s. Sable, Marten, and Fox pelts were harvested by the thousands, while squirrel pelt numbers reached even more tremendous numbers. Fur, in some ways, paved the way for Russia's modernization: furs (or \\"soft gold,\\" as it was also called) were used as gifts for foreign ambassadors, paid for the expenses of the Tsar's court, and kept his government running smoothly. Furs helped finance the militarization of the Russian Empire, helping to win back lands from the Poles and the Swedes and funding the monstrous engine of expansion and modernization that was Peter the Great's main mission during his rule. Because profits from the fur trade so fed the Russian machine during this time, it is perhaps no wonder that the Tsar wanted to preserve some lands for hunting purposes rather than for agricultural pursuits. In fact, in 1683, the Siberian Office sent to Yakutsks governors a proclamation that stated there was to be: \\"a firm prohibition on pain of death that henceforth in sable hunting grounds no forest whatever [was] to be cut or burned, in order that the animals be not exterminated nor flee to distant parts\\". As the animals were quickly hunted out of their traditional territory and the fur frontier was pushed evermore to the east, however, the fur trade dwindled and the scale tipped in favor of agriculture. The most resounding win for Siberian agriculture came in 1822, with the reforms of Mikhail Speransky. Whereas before, the native nomads of Siberia had been considered as such, they were now relegated to an artificial \\"settled\\" category and put on the same level as Russian settlers. This had two main implications for the region: Siberian natives were kept in conditions of destitution because of the increase in tax burden they were forced to face and large sections of land were freed up for cultivation. With the influx of Russian peasants into areas that had traditionally been used as pastureland and hunting grounds, many natives decided to abandon their old ways of subsistence and fit themselves into the categories that the government had decreed for them. However, Russian settlers started the habit of seizing native lands if they were especially fertile or lay in advantageous locations. The method for claiming lands was as simple as taking them by force from the Siberian natives, which was a practice that came to be legalized by an official decree in 1879. This could take many forms, one of which being that Russian settlers sometimes simply ploughed up the land around a native family's yurt, forcing them to move. Through similar processes occurring all throughout Siberia, the fur business slowly transitioned to agriculture.  Pre-1917 agricultural growth  During this Russian settlement, as peasants tried to establish themselves in the midst of harsh conditions and all the while battling the fur trade, the population and agricultural output were steadily rising. In the beginning of the 18th century, the entire population hovered around 500,000, while 150 years later, in the middle of the 19th century, it was nearing three million. Hand in hand with population growth came increased agricultural output. For example, in the period from 1850 to 1900, grain production went from 1.4 million tons to over 7 million tons. Indeed, this amounted to 16% of Russia's total grain production. By 1910, when roughly 80 million acres of farmland were in use producing foodstuffs in Siberia, a million-ton annual surplus of wheat was established. In fact, compared with other areas of the country, around the turn of the century, Siberia's agriculture was quite technologically advanced. In 1911, when their European Russian equivalents were still threshing their grain by hand, Siberian Russians had an impressive collection of 37,000 mowing machines and 39,000 horse-drawn rakes. Siberians were using a full 25% of the Agricultural machinery in the country, which was part of the reason that grain production exploded in this period. Their animal helpers were also in better supply than in European Russia: Siberian Russians had twice as many oxen, three times as many horses, five times as many sheep, and nineteen times as many goats. The particular Siberian twist when it came to livestock, however, was the number of domesticated reindeer in the area, as many as 250,000 in the mid-19th century. By 1917, the year of the Bolshevik Revolution, Siberian industry was still in a fledgling state: its total output amounted to a mere 3.5% of the Russian total. However, and perhaps surprising considering Siberia's stereotypes (but not surprising considering all of the information and data presented above), agriculture played a much more central role in the life of the region.  Siberian butter industry  One facet of Siberian agriculture that may not be common knowledge is its thriving butter industry. By 1912, the Altai Region, which exists in the southernmost reaches of Siberia, close to the convergence of China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan, was among the most densely populated area of Siberia. By the time of the First World War, the majority of the tillable land of the area was in use. There was also significant Cattle- breeding in this area, both by Russians and by natives. Taking advantage of these circumstances, a group of Danes had previously come to the region and introduced Siberia to the butter industry, though mainly starting their production plants in the cities of Tomsk and Tiumen. A butter romance, or as W. Bruce Lincoln described, a \\"butter fever,\\" thus sprung up on the grasslands of what many may think is the world's coldest, most inhospitable terrain. A quote that serves to capture its importance comes from P.A. Stolypin, the Russian Prime Minister himself: \\"The whole of our butter export to foreign markets is entirely based on the growth of Siberian butter production. Siberian butter-making brings us more than twice as much gold as the whole Siberian gold industry\\". This Siberian industry was so extensive, in fact, that by 1917, half of all butter-producing plants in Russia were to be found in Siberia, and a staggering 90% of butter exportation came originally from this area. In 1907, butter production had reached an astonishing 63,000 tons, almost a tenfold increase over the amounts produced just thirteen years prior, in 1894. By 1914, Siberia had surpassed Australia and the Netherlands (major world suppliers of butter) in butter production and churning out just slightly less than Denmark, the country to which the Siberian butter trade owed its roots. Butter made more revenue than any other good apart from gold, wheat, and furs in that same year. Butter production carried such weight that, coupled with the Siberian grain industry, Lincoln credits it as playing one of the key roles in enticing foreign investment to enter the region around the turn of the century. These plants were hit hard after this, however, with the internal strife of both the Bolshevik Revolution and the Russian Civil War, so much so that butter output dropped to a mere 6,000 tons in 1922, dipping below the 1894 levels. A revival came by 1927, however, when the 37,000-ton mark was reached and butter again became an important Russian export. However, the heydays of the Russian butter behemoth were over. Bolshevik Revolution Siberian agriculture underwent a tremendous shift as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution. The Bolshevik coup d'etat began in 1917 when Vladimir Lenin and his followers deposed Alexander Kerensky's Russian Provisional Government and established a Communist regime. In the time leading to the Bolshevik Revolution, there was a substantial amount of distress amongst Soviet peasants‚Äîso much so that many analysts \\"have focused upon the Russian rural economy for the light that such an investigation might shed upon political and economic forces leading to the Revolution of 1917.\\" It is a bit ambitious to assume that the Revolution of 1917 completely sparked out of agrarian peasant problems, but it is not too outlandish to propose that it most likely was one a few key contributing factors the Bolshevik Revolution. The Agrarian Crisis of 1905 most certainly contributed to the future revolution of 1917. The 1905 crisis was unquestionably related to peasant agrarian problems in three ways. The first was that there was a decline in the amount of agricultural production in comparison with the amount that had been generally accepted and produced in the past. The second was that peasant living standards began to diminish mostly due to a reduction in grain for consumption either because taxes increased, there was lessened production or because of \\"the government's policy of forcing grain exports.\\" The third reason encompassed the conventional concerns one would have in regards to an economy that's mostly dependent on agriculture such as lack of fertility, exploitation of the land and the implementation of unhelpful government policies. Specific indications that led to up the Agrarian Crisis were \\"rising land prices, growing arrears in peasant redemption payments, the famine of the early 1890s, declining per capita land holdings of the peasants and the reports of peasant impoverishment in grain deficit provinces.\\" From the previously reported symptoms leading up to the Crisis, it is logical to deduce that the Agrarian Crisis of 1905 was directly related to peasant unrest in relation to land unrest. Dekulakization and collectivization Between the years of 1929 to 1932, the Soviet Communist Party under Joseph Stalin organized dekulakization and collectivization. Dekulakization involved the killing and deportation of millions of peasants and their families. Collectivization signified the \\"effective abolition of private property in land, and the concentration of the remaining peasantry in 'collective' farming under Party control.\\" Although collectivization is discussed in relation to agriculture, it is quite evident that the Communist Party's Policy was directed not only at collectivizing land, but also at collectivizing people. The thought process and reasoning behind collectivizing agriculture was that having a few larger \\"mechanized grain or livestock farms\\" seemed as though it would be much more functional than having several independent farms. In contrast, in regards to people, \\"the principle aim of collectivization was 'to concentrate the native population as much as possible'\\" and to scrap nomadism.  Virgin Lands Campaign  By the 1950s, increases in the standard of living prompted a move by the state to increase the quantity and quality of foodstuffs for the general population. To meet this goal, the Virgin Lands Campaign was established under Nikita Khrushchev, which set aside ten million hectares of grassland for cultivation, mainly in western Siberia and on the Kazakh Steppe, and enlisted the help of over 640,000 young volunteers in the first three years alone. Many of these were recruited with help from the Young Communist League and showered with praise for going out into the countryside to help further the cause of Communism. Khrushchev had lofty goals, speaking of overtaking America's food production with the help of this initiative. Indeed, one of his goals was to turn this area into a Russian version of Iowa's vast cornfields. Though this program markedly increased food production, soil erosion became widespread by the middle of the 60's along with dissatisfaction to eating non-traditional corn and corn-based products. Agricultural revival of nineteen seventies and eighties Prior to the decades of the nineteen seventies and eighties, developing and expanding the agricultural infrastructure of the Russian countryside was given a lower priority vis-a-vis industry. Schools, hospitals, roads and other structures serving the community remained underdeveloped compared with the amount of effort and funding invested in keeping urban centers up to speed with the western world. Even though rural conditions vastly improved, the amount of attention paid to improving urban centers was undeniably in much higher favor. However, despite the existence of a so-called \\"urban-rural\\" gap, rural areas (also referred to as peri-urban areas) were able to thrive over \\"spillover effects\\" from well-developed metropolitan areas nearby. People living in these peri-urban areas took advantage of the infrastructural developments from these cities by taking the opportunity to develop reliable transportation to and from the city thus creating a link between urban and rural areas in Russia. As a result, this linkage between the city and the countryside led to a relationship in which both sides benefited and agriculture subsequently expanded. The rural demographic shift to urban areas that plagued most rural counties did not tremendously affect peri-urban areas in Russia. In fact, these areas seemed to experience population increase and at minimum a stabilization in population size. The agricultural and labor supply mirrored the activity of population growth in that it experienced stabilization or a rise in productivity. The proliferation observed in peri- urban communities during this time was not a universal trend. During the nineteen seventies and eighties, the west, conversely was thrown into disorder by the \\"disruptive influence of urbanization on agriculture.\\" During the mid-1980s, agricultural output suffered a lag in productivity that directly correlated with distance from an urban center. The so-called \\"rural periphery\\" or the land that was located outside a two-hour radius from an urban center was being cultivated inefficiently and ineffectively. The way in which the land was cultivated was done so unwisely‚Äîtoo much of the land was farmed at one time in contrast to using a structure like that of crop rotation, which uses modern irrigation techniques and a variance of crops. In other words, what was going on can be simplified as \\"the greater the amount of land under cultivation, the lower the productivity\\", which led ultimately led to a lack in fertility. Landowners began to abandon their land and failed to report the actual size of their property to the Federal Statistical Agency. As a result, the Soviet Regime was quite unaware of the magnitude of this problem and failed to address it properly. During the nineteen eighties, aerial photographs were taken that displayed that the amount of land reported to authorities was only half of what was actually being cultivated. Statistics show that \\"agricultural land contracted to 20 to 46 percent between 1959 and 1989\\", the biggest reduction occurring in the Northern European region of Russia; however, it is estimated that the actual percentage of agricultural land that was abandoned was nearly twice the size than what was recorded. This lack of honesty and communication instigated distrust and an inability of the Soviet Regime to be helpful in solving this agricultural crisis. Soil fertility and the plausibility of easily accessing a metropolitan center were deemed the two most important factors that contributed to the success of an agricultural community. In order to measure the success of certain conditions on land used for agricultural production in Russia, a particular method was used. It involved analyzing specific \\"regionally representative parcels of land in the absence of irrigation and any other sophisticated cultivation method\\" and taking into consideration aspects such as \\"soil type, temperature and moisture\\". According to these \\"so-called bioclimatic potential yields,\\" it was determined that in Siberia, the \\"far-eastern Primorsky krai and Amur oblast\\" were most prosperous in terms of agricultural potential. In the 1990s, with the onset of market reforms, agricultural output collapsed, and rural agricultural areas continued to decline in productivity, though they were not alone in this lack of output as urban centers began to suffer in terms of manufacturing, but at an even higher rate. This was not only alarming because never had such a statistic revealed itself, but also because the agricultural realm was so dependent on the consistency of the urban realm for its own survival that such a decline would prove harmful to both spheres. The dramatic crop failure of 1998 that Siberia experienced did not help the situation either. Subsidiary farming, a form of farming executed by small-town inhabitants in their private yards, began to rise during this period further proving a regression in rural production. The institution of subsidiary farming represented a serious step back in terms of modern development. A severe cut in the number of cattle head was also a major signifier of the agricultural difficulties occurring at the time. Although it was acknowledged that it was more economical to import meat to Russia as opposed to raising and feeding cattle as it had normally done in previous decades, the massive number of cattle head that had vanished was too significant to ignore. A solution to the late 20th century agricultural crisis A solution to the succession of problems that had snowballed for decades was threefold: \\"contraction of agricultural space, demographic revival and vertical integration of food producers\\". Russian farmland was of great value to the country, but on the other hand it was excessively burdensome. Only a small percentage of farms were actually profitable to the country‚Äîmaking the rest of them an abandoned and cumbersome load. \\"Because communal farming in outlying areas could not be disbanded\\" due to the underlying purpose of its establishment to act as a \\"vehicle for collective survival,\\" many failing farms could not be abandoned according to government regulations. The persistence to keep afloat unprofitable farms was perhaps one of the greater disadvantages to the development of the Russian economy. This movement dragged down on the economy and likewise prevented successful farms from having the opportunity to \\"reinvest their profits, because of the redistribution of these profits to the benefit of unprofitable farms\\". Demographic revival introduced itself as a key player in the road to restoring Russia's agricultural sphere. Although the Russian countryside will never be as populated as it once was, great efforts are being made to bring its population size back to where it was. In 1992, rural communities enjoyed a two-year movement in which more people moved from metropolitan areas to the countryside than vice versa. The value of population increase in rural areas is directly related to maintenance of farmland‚Äîthe more people that live in the countryside, literally the more hands there are to work the land and maintain the abundance of farmland. Thus, an increase in rural population would consequently lead to an improvement in Siberian agriculture. Two components that are considered when discussing population are \\"migration and natural increase;\\" the first is more important initially because able adults are necessary to motivate a developing community. However, the second term becomes equally important with time when the people who moved to the countryside begin to reproduce and settle permanently in rural districts. Alexsandr Chaianov is credited for hypothesizing the theory of \\"agricultural cooperation in which he distinguished between vertical and horizontal forms of cooperative arrangements\\". The horizontal cooperation was described as a much more dysfunctional model in which small farms were identified as units that formed links with each other. The vertical cooperation was described as a much more practical model in that it involved linking \\"farms with food processors and retailers\\" in a hierarchical and feasible trend.

Similarly, the regimes have democratic institutions that allow for nominal amounts of competition. Such regimes are particularly susceptible to outbreaks of armed conflict and unexpected or adverse changes in leadership. The operational definition of anocracy is extensively used by scholars Monty G. Marshall and Benjamin R. Cole at the Center for Systemic Peace and gains most of its dissemination through the polity data series. The data set aims to measure democracy in different states and retains anocracy as one of its classification methods for regime type. Consequently, anocracy frequently appears in democratization literature that utilizes the polity-data set. In a closed anocracy, competitors are drawn from the elite. In an open anocracy, others also compete. The number of anocratic regimes has steadily increased over time, with the most notable jump occurring after the end of the Cold War. From 1989 to 2013, the number of anocracies increased from 30 to 53.  Terminology  Use of the word \\"anocracy\\" in English dates back to at least 1950, when R. F. C. Hull's reprinted translation of Martin Buber's 1946 work Pfade in Utopia [Paths in Utopia] distinguished \\"anocracy\\" (neoclassical compound: ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ± akratia) from \\"anarchy\\" - \\"not absence of government but absence of domination\\".  Characteristics   Human rights  The instability of anocratic regimes causes human rights violations to be significantly higher within anocracies than democratic regimes. According to Maplecroft's 2014 Human Rights Risk Atlas, eight of the top ten worst human rights violating countries are anocracies. In addition, the report categorized every current anocracy as \\"at risk\\" or at \\"extreme risk\\" of human rights offenses. The high correlation between anocratic regimes and human rights abuses denotes the nonlinear progression in a country's transition from an autocracy to a democracy. Generally, human rights violations substantially decrease when a certain threshold of full democracy is reached. However, human rights abuses tend to remain the same or even to increase as countries move from an autocratic to an anocratic regime. During the revolutions of the Arab Spring, Libya, Egypt, and Yemen, all of the countries made relative progress towards more democratic regimes. With many of the authoritarian practices of their governments remaining, those states currently fall under the category of anocracies. They are also listed as some of the most extreme human rights violating countries in the world. The violations include torture, police brutality, slavery, discrimination, unfair trials, and restricted freedom of expression. Research has shown that political protests, such as those that occurred during the Arab Spring, generally lead to an increase in human right violations, as the existing government tries to retain power and influence over governmental opposition. Therefore, transitioning governments tend to have high levels of human rights abuses. In its annual Freedom in the World report, Freedom House scored states‚Äô violations of civil liberties on a seven- point scale, with a score of seven representing the highest percentage of violations. Freedom House defined civil liberty violations as the infringement of freedom of expression, associational and organizational rights, rule of law, and individual rights. Most consolidated democracies received scores of one, but almost all anocracies were scored between four and six because of the high percentage of civil liberties violations in most anocratic regimes.  Violence  Statistics show that anocracies are ten times more likely to experience intrastate conflict than democracies and twice as likely as autocracies. One explanation for the increase in violence and conflict within anocracies is a theory known as More Murder in the Middle (MMM). The theory argues that the unstable characteristics of anocratic regimes, which include the presence of divided elites, inequality, and violent challengers who threaten the legitimacy of the current social order, cause governing elites to resort to much more political repression or state terror than do democratic or authoritarian regimes. That leads to high levels of what are termed \\"life- integrity violations,\\" which include state-sponsored genocide, extrajudicial executions, and torture. State life-integrity violations can be categorized as acts of state terror.Gibney, Mark. Wood, Reed M.

However, without the stability of a clear authoritarian rule or a consolidated democracy, anocracies are more open and susceptible to terrorist attacks. He notes that in Iraq and previously Spain and Russia, transitions from an authoritarian regime to a democracy were accompanied by temporary increases in terrorism. According to the political terror scale (PTS), a data set that ranks state sponsored violence on a five-point scale, almost every anocracy is ranked as having a score between three and five.Gibney, M., Cornett, L., Wood, R., & Haschke, P., (2012) Political Terror Scale 1976-2012. Retrieved from http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/ On the scale, a score of three indicates that in a state, \\"there is extensive political imprisonment, or a recent history of such imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without a trial, for political views is accepted.\\" States are ranked as a four when \\"civil and political rights violations have expanded to large numbers of the population. Murders, disappearances and torture are a common part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects those who interest themselves in politics or ideas.\\" Scores of five are given to states if \\"terror has expanded to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.\\" Although only eleven states were given scores of five in the 2012 Political Terror Scale report, four of those states, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Somalia, and Sudan, were classified by the polity data series as anocracies. Civil war There are differing views on whether or not anocracy leads to civil war. It is debated whether or not transitions between government regimes or political violence lead to civil war. Civil war in unstable countries are usually the outcome of a country's inability to meet the population's demands. The inability for the state to provide the needs of the population leads to factionalism within the country. When factions are not able to get what they want, they take up arms against the state. Former democracies that transition to anocracy have a greater risk of being embroiled in civil conflict. The population's awareness of what rights they had as a democratic society may compel them to fight to regain their rights and liberties. On the other hand, autocracies that transition into anocracies are less likely to break out in civil war. Not all anocracies are unstable. There are many countries that are stable but are classified as anocracies, such as Russia. It is the transitional qualities associated with some anocracies that are predicative of civil conflict. The magnitude of the transition also affects the probability of a civil conflict. The higher magnitude of the transition, the higher likelihood of civil war. However, some international relations experts use the polity data series in the formulation of their hypothesis and study, which presents a problem because the Polity IV system uses violence and civil war as factors in ts computation of a country's polity score. Two components, \\"the degree of institutionalization, or regulation, of political competition,\\" and \\"the extent of government restriction on political competition,\\" are problematic to use in any study involving Polity IV and civil war in anocratic governments. In the numeric rating system of one of these parts of Polity IV, unregulated, \\"may or may be characterized by violent conflict among partisan groups.\\" The other component states that \\"there are relatively stable and enduring political groups - but competition among them is intense, hostile, and frequently violent.\\" The only thing that can be deduced concretely is that political violence tends to lead to civil war. There is no solid evidence to support that political institutions in an anocracy leads to civil war.  Broadness and complexity While the first three characteristics capture the instability of anocracies, another feature of anocratic regimes is their broad descriptiveness. Anocracy describes a regime type with a mix of institutional characteristics that either constrains or promotes the democratic process, \\"encapsulating a complex category encompassing many institutional arrangements.\\" Although anocracies demonstrate some capacity for civil society and political participation, their autocratic and democratic counterparts show considerably more or less capabilities. Thus, while scholars are easily able to identify democratic and autocratic regimes based on their respective characteristics, anocracies become a wider, \\"catchall\\" category for all other regimes. However, despite its broadness and complexity, the convention is still used because of its relevance to civil instability as well as its usage in the polity data series. Examples Asia Cambodia Cambodia is an example of anocracy because its government displays democratic and authoritarian aspects. Under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Cambodia implemented an electoral system based on proportional representation, held legitimate elections, and it instituted a parliamentary system of government. The constitution, created on 21 September 1993 indicated that Cambodia was a parliamentary government with a constitutional monarchy. Cambodia exhibited signs of a democratic state, especially with the presence of elections and a proportionally-representative government. After the coup in 1997, the Cambodian government has taken more authoritarian measures to keep peace in the country. Protests have been suppressed violently by pro-government forces and many human rights activists and protester have been arrested by the Cambodian government. Cambodia shows signs of being an unstable government with abrupt changes in leadership, making it an anocratic. The initial elections led to FUNCINPEC's victory, under the leadership of Prince Ranariddh. FUNCINPEC and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party won 68 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly. The Cambodian People's Party, led by Hun Sen, refused to accept the outcome. Although a coalitional government was created with Prince Ranariddh as the First Prime Minister and Sen as the Second Prime Minister, the deal failed as Sen led a coup d'√©tat on July 5, 1997. Sen and the CPP have been in power ever since, and the CPP recently won a general election against the Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy. Thailand Thailand's history of leadership changes make it an anocratic state. Thailand has been in a constant state of political upheaval since 1993. Coups d'√©tat and widespread political corruption are the main causes of political instability. Thailand experienced a period of political liberalization under General Prem Tinsulanonda, an unelected prime minister from 1980 to 1988. A series of coups ensued soon afterward. General Suchinda Kraprayoon led a coup against Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan on February 23, 1991. After the Black May incident, Suchinda was forced to resign, and Anand Panyarachun was assigned the position of temporary prime minister. Thaksin Shinawatra won the 2001 elections and became prime minister; he won again in 2005 but was deposed in the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat. After a new constitution was adopted, Samak Sundaravej and his People's Power Party (Thailand) won the 2007 election, and Sundaravej became prime minister. However, a conflict of interest caused Sundaravej to be ousted, and Somchai Wongsawat was elected as the new prime minister. Shortly after his election, Prime Minister Wongsawat and the PPP was found guilty of electoral fraud, and Wongsawat lost his position. Abhisit Vejjajiva's election as the next prime minister was met with opposition by \\"Red Shirts.\\" On July 3, 2011, Yingluck Shinawatra, belonging to the Pheu Thai Party, was elected as prime minister. After mass protests in 2013, Shinawatra was deposed by a military coup led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, who is the current prime minister. Burma Burma, or the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, is classified as an anocracy because of adverse armed conflict, changes in leadership, and the partly-democratic, partly-authoritarian nature of its government. Burma had a representative democracy after it gained independence from Britain. Soon after independence was achieved, there was an outbreak of various insurgencies and rebellions. Many of the insurgencies were caused by divides along ethnic lines. One of the most prominent civil wars in Burma, the Kachin conflict, restarted in 2011, and Burma is still embroiled in a civil war. Burma has had a history of changes in government, usually by military coups. In 1962, General Ne Win enacted a military coup and created the Burma Socialist Programme Party, which held power for 26 years. On September 18, 1988, General Saw Maung led another military coup to return the government to the people and created the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which was renamed State Peace and Development Council. After holding free and legitimate elections in May 1990, the National League for Democracy (NLD) won with Aung San Suu Kyi at its head. However, the military junta refused to give up power to the NLD. The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), backed by the military, won the 2010 elections and the military government was dissolved soon afterwad. The Burmese government shows signs of having democratic as well as authoritarian features. Burma is a pseudodemocratic state because of the elections that were held in 1990 and 2010. However, both elections were problematic because the military did not transfer power to the winning party in 1990, and the 2010 elections were seen as illegitimate. Violent repression is the biggest signifier of the authoritarian nature of the Burmese government. The Win regime was marked by extreme oppression and human rights abuses and as a result, Burmese civilians and students protested against the government. The Burmese government responded violently to the protests and the Tatmadaw, or Myanmar Armed Forces, killed many of the protestors. After the coup in 1988 by General Maung, the protests were violently suppressed again, as Maung's government proceeded to implement martial law to bring peace and order. Africa At the end of World War II, European control over its colonial territories in Africa diminished. During the period of decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s, many African states gained independence. Although these newly independent African states could become either democratic or autocratic regimes, manageability issues made way for autocratic regimes to come into power. Most underdeveloped African states that did become democracies in this time period failed within 10 years and transitioned to autocracies. For about 30 years after 1960, the number of autocratic regimes in Africa rose from 17 to 41 as the number of democratic regimes stayed around five. After the collapse of communism in Europe and the rise of democratization at the end of the Cold War, Africa experienced a major political transformation. In the 1990s, the number of autocracies decreased to nine, and the number of democracies increased to nine since many African countries remained an anocratic. By 2012, Africa had three autocracies, 17 democracies, and 30 anocracies. By 2013, most African countries had remained either open or closed anocracies. As African states transition from autocracy to anocracy and from anocracy to democracy, electoral conflicts and violence remain prevalent. Nigeria With a polity score of four in 2014, Nigeria is categorized as an open anocracy, transitioning closer to democracy than autocracy. In recent years, Nigeria has displayed characteristics of anocratic regimes including political corruption and electoral riggings. Following years of military rule after gaining independence in 1960 to 1999 except for 1979 to 1983, the 2007 general elections marked the first time in Nigerian history that political leadership was passed from one civilian to another by an election. However, in late 2006, just months before the April 2007 general election, ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo used state institutions to try to defeat political opponents as he attempted to win a third presidential term. Using the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), an institution created by his administration, the former president had some of his political enemies and their family members arrested or detained. Despite the electoral conflicts, some Nigerians view their country as running on democratic principles because military power has been controlled by political elites for 15 years. However, those electoral conflicts, combined with state governors using legislative and judiciary power, to win elections repeatedly suggests that Nigeria remains an anocracy. Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan was accused of abusing his power in an attempt to remain in office after 2015, despite claiming his presidency advocated democratic principles. President Muhammadu Buhari had also during his tenure intimidated, attacked and killed hundreds of peaceful protesters in various parts of the country who were frustrated with his bad government. Zimbabwe When Robert Mugabe gained presidency in 1980, Zimbabwe was listed as an open anocracy with a polity score of four. By 1987, the country had almost fully transitioned to an authoritarian regime, with a polity score of negative six, which made it a closed anocracy. After remaining on the border between an authoritarian regime and closed anocracy for over a decade, Zimbabwe's polity score increased in the early 2000s. Currently, Zimbabwe has a polity score of 4, making it an open anocracy. In recent years, Zimbabwe has moved toward becoming a more democratic regime, but electoral conflicts and human rights violations still exist leaving Zimbabwe as an anocratic regime. When Zimbabwe was a closed anocracy in the late 1990s, the country experienced major human rights violations. Labor strikes were common, as employers did not listen to the demands of their employers, and real wages fell by 60 percent from 1992 to 1997. The labor strikes that occurred in the late 1990s were declared illegal by the government of Zimbabwe, and blame was put on poor working-class citizens. As labor laws continued hurting workers, health services declined, and housing projects stagnated. Since becoming president in 1980, Mugabe used a variety of tactics to remain in power that led to major electoral conflicts over the years. In the March 2008 presidential election, the electoral body reported that Morgan Tsvangirai, the presidential candidate of the opposing party, had received more votes than Mugabe. However, because Tsvangirai received 48% of the vote and not an absolute majority, it was announced that a runoff would take place. Using intimidation tactics, including murder threats, Mugabe and his party forced Tsvangirai to withdraw from the runoff, and Mugabe remained in power. A US-led United Nations security council to impose sanctions on Mugabe failed, and talks about powersharing between Mugabe and Tsvangirai ended soon after the runoff. After an opposing party candidate, Lovemore Moyo, won Speaker of the Legislature, a powersharing coalition was finally set up in September 2008 in which Tsvangirai was named prime minister. The polity score of Zimbabwe had increased from one to four by 2010. However, in 2013, Mugabe won his seventh straight presidential term, and the election was criticized for being rigged to allow Mugabe to win. Uganda In the 1990s, Uganda transitioned from an autocracy to a closed anocracy. Although Uganda saw a jump in its polity score in the mid-2000s, it has retained a polity score of negative two for the last decade. Uganda is populated by many ethnic groups with the Buganda group, the largest of these groups, making up 17% of the population. Since Uganda gained independence in 1962, incessant conflict has ensued between approximately 17 ethnic groups, which has led to political instability. The dictator Idi Amin was responsible for around 300,000 deaths under his rule from 1971 to 1979, and guerrilla warfare from 1980 to 1985 under Milton Obote killed 100,000 people. Human rights abuses under both rulers led to even more deaths from 1971 to 1985. In the early 1990s, Uganda experienced large-scale violent dissent as the country experienced more rebellions and guerrilla warfare. As a result of the wars, the government called for nonparty presidential and legislative elections in the mid-1990s. A period of relative peace followed, as a common law legal system was instituted in 1995. Uganda transitioned from an authoritarian regime to a closed anocracy. The political situation of Uganda has seen little improvement under the rule of Yoweri Museveni, who has maintained power since 1986 because other political organizations in Uganda cannot sponsor candidates. Only Museveni and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) can operate without any limitations leading to electoral conflicts and violence. Somalia Somalia was labeled as an autocracy from 1969 to 2012, with a polity score of negative seven throughout the entire period. From 1969 to 1991, Siad Barre was the military dictator of the Somali Democratic Republic. After Barre was overthrown in 1991, two decades of chaos ensued, as civil war broke out and rival warlords fought to gain power. The consistent fighting of tribal leaders and warlords made the country unable to deal with natural disasters, droughts, and famines, which caused a combined 500,000 deaths in famines in 1992 and 2010 to 2012. After years of being split into fiefdoms, the main Somali warlords established an agreement to appoint a new president in 2004. However, the plan failed when Islamist insurgents, including the radical youth militia al-Shabaab, which has links to Al-Qaeda, gained control over much of southern Somalia from 2006 to 2008. With the assistance of international peace keeping offensives and the Kenyan army, the Islamist insurgents were forced to withdraw in 2012. In the same year, the first formal parliament in over 20 years was appointed in Somalia. The newly formed parliament chose Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in September 2012. With international assistance, the Somali government has been able to rebuild itself and the country has recently been relatively more stable. Since 2013, Somalia has retained a polity score of five and is listed as an open anocracy. Europe Russia Russia, as of 2016, is classified as an open anocracy on the Polity IV scale, which means that it is between one and five in its score. Open anocracies hold democratic elections, but they are not very free, and the country does not grant some rights of the population. Russia allegedly has all of the characteristics.Compare:  Ukraine  In late 2013, the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, conducted talks with the European Union about establishing closer ties. Instead, Yanukovych backed out of the prospective agreement and turned to Russia for some multibillion-dollar loans. Civil unrest broke out in the streets of Kiev, with the citizens showing their anger over the president spurning the European Union. Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014 as the protests got out of hand. An interim government took office in early 2014, with new elections scheduled for later in 2014. A referendum that was held to determine if Crimea would become part of Russia came under criticism. Questionable plebiscites are characteristic of anocracy[citation needed]. In February 2014, the death toll in Kiev rose to almost 100 because of escalating clashes between demonstrators and security forces. However, the duration of the period in which the term ('Anocracy') might be considered relevant to Ukraine did not last long. Rather, a number of outbreaks fitted mostly into the Maidan period (from 30 November 2013 to 20 February 2014) and notably concentrated around certain events that marked the intensification of the hostilities. Elements of Ukraine have consistently indulged in violence before and after the Maidan to silence journalists and other opposition members. Some of the individuals have even been organized into frontline paramilitaries. Theoretically, the secession of territories (Crimea to the South and Donbass to the East) might be other tokens to justify the classification of Ukraine as an anocracy. However, in both cases, Russia has been found to have been supporting the separatist groups. The contested 2014 Crimean status referendum led to international condemnation, and public opinion might have been skewed by propaganda in Russian media, which dominated the peninsula's media landscape, as well as temporary vacuum of the central power after Yanukovych had fled the country. Although the same has been attempted in the rest of Southeastern Ukraine (such as in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, and Dnipro), but it succeeded only in the extreme southeast, in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and would have been inevitably ended without both open and implicit Russian intervention and military aid. Yugoslavia Yugoslavia was a large country in Europe until the 1990s that was held together in the latter half of the 20th century mostly by the dictator Josip Broz Tito, who ruled by force of personality. Tensions rose between the different ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, including the Croats, Serbs, Albanians, Bosnian Muslims, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Slovenians. New separate states formed: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. The destructive Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s cost many lives. The fragmentation of power in Yugoslavia, the disputed elections, and the discontent of the differentiated ethnic political groups are the main factors resulting in Yugoslavia and its successor states being considered anocracies. The political stagnation, and the non-civilian control of the military during the civil wars played a large part as well. Successful transitions to democracy Anocratic regimes are often implicitly mentioned in democratic transition literature. There are numerous examples of regimes that have successfully transitioned to democracy from anocracy. Mexico Mexico's transition from an anocratic to democratic regime occurred on the 1980s and the 1990s on the electoral stage. The period was characterized by the rise of multiple parties, the decline of power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and the decentralization of power from the national level into municipalities. The democratization process produced competitive elections with less voting fraud, culminating with the 1994 presidential election. There was also a documented increase in the role of media and journalism during this period, which led to the creation of various special interest groups, such as those representing the environment, indigenous rights, and women's rights. However, violence continues to remain a characteristic of Mexico's local elections. Taiwan In the aftermath of World War II, Japan surrendered Taiwan to the Republic of China. The constitution was used by the Republic of China to govern Taiwan guaranteed civil rights and elections, but it was ignored in favor of rule under martial law. Taiwan's pro-democracy movement gained momentum in the early 1980s and coalesced into the formation of the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986. Over the next decade, Taiwan attempted to restore the civil rights promised in its constitution, culminating with the Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996. Taiwan continues to move towards a consolidated democracy. Ghana In 1991, Ghana was listed as an autocratic regime with a polity score of negative seven. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ghana was an open anocracy. In 2005, Ghana successfully transitioned from an open anocracy to a democracy as it has retained a polity score of eight since 2006. A major part of Ghana's success can be attributed to its management of the electoral process to decrease electoral conflict. Since Ghana began having elections in 1992, the strengthening of government institutions such as a strong, independent electoral commission has decreased electoral conflict. The existence of civil society organizations and a media aimed at ensuring democratic principles have also helped manage electoral conflicts in Ghana. For example, Ghana's 2008 elections ended peacefully, as political institutions were able to respond to electoral challenges and advance democratic principles and processes. However, some electoral conflicts remain on a small scale in Ghana such as ethnic vote blocking, vote buying, intimidation, and hate speeches. Yet, even with those minor conflicts, Ghana has been able to transform from an anocracy to a democracy by decreasing electoral conflicts.

The song was written by Kaliopi and Romeo Grill and produced by Grill. It is best known as Macedonia's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 held in Baku, Azerbaijan. The song qualified Macedonia to the final evening of the competition after a preceding four-year period of non- qualifying entries. The song placed 13th in the competition with a total of 71 points, receiving top marks from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Background On 19 November 2011, MRT invited Kaliopi to represent Macedonia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. After this announcement, Kaliopi and MRT held a press conference where Kaliopi revealed that she was unsure about what type of song she would take to the competition, but that she would consider her own compositions as well as those of her colleagues and international submissions. The instrumental composition for Crno i belo was sent to Kaliopi by former band member and ex-husband Romeo Grill, with whom she had extensively collaborated with previously on solo material, as well as decades prior when the band \\"Kaliopi\\" was still active. Kaliopi wrote lyrics for the composition and proceeded with recording the song in early 2012 with Grill at the MRT studio in Skopje. Eurovision Song Contest On 29 February, in an hour and a half long program aired by MRT, Kaliopi was joined by musical guests from the region where she performed songs from her repertoire, as well as unveiling Crno i belo for the first time. In the same evening Kaliopi also performed the English version of the song, Black and White. Macedonia was drawn to compete 2nd at the second semi-finals on 24 May. The song eventually advanced into the finals and was drawn to perform 22nd in the line-up. At the grand final, held on 26 May, the song eventually placed 13th, with 71 points. It scored the same as 12th placed Romania's Mandinga, but the latter earned points from more countries, causing Kaliopi to place 13th instead. Music video The music video for \\"Crno i belo\\", directed by Aleksandar Ristovski - Princ, was filmed in Bitola. The video premiered on 17 March 2012. It is set in an empty theatre and abandoned building. Kaliopi performs the song with a piano on stage while supporting musicians are filmed at other locations.

Quoted in Gaelsc√©al, \\"Cuimhn√≠ Cinn √≥n Oireachtas\\", n.d. web reference link now dead In the following year, N√≠ Chr√≥in√≠n started singing lessons, and was particularly influenced by local singers such as M√°ire N√≠ Ch√©illeachair and Eoin√≠ Maidhc√≠ √ì Suilleabh√°in, from whom she was able to learn her songs.As a teenager, she won prestigious sean- n√≥s singing prizes, in particular winning in her age category at the Fleadh Cheoil na h√âireann in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, N√≠ Chr√≥in√≠n won a medal at the Oireachtas na Gaeilge competition, second place amongst the female singers under 35 years of age (the ‚ÄòCorn Ph√°draig Mhic an R√≠‚Äô, or ‚ÄòCorn na mBan‚Äô), and she returned in 2010 to win first place in the same category. Having now won the young women's category, she qualified to compete for the primary event of the Oireachtas, the ‚ÄòCorn U√≠ Riada‚Äô in the following year. She took part as one of eighteen contestants in 2011, singing ‚ÄòCath Ch√©im an Fhia‚Äô and ‚ÄòAn Cail√≠n Aerach‚Äô, although Jimmy √ì Ceannabh√°in ultimately won the coveted top prize.

Gram Vikas works towards enabling rural communities to lead a dignified life. This is done by building capabilities of village communities, strengthening community institutions and mobilising resources. Gram Vikas works on six focus areas which are water, livelihoods, sanitation & hygiene, habitat & technologies, village institutions and education. \\"Gram Vikas\\" translates to \\"village development\\", both in Hindi and in Odia, the official language of Odisha. History Origins Led by Joe Madiath, 400 volunteers from the Young Students Movement for Development, Chennai came to Odisha after the 1971 cyclone to undertake relief and rehabilitation work in the affected areas. They worked in villages in the then Cuttack district developing lift irrigation projects. This helped increase agricultural productivity for the farmers, but had little impact on the poor, who were mostly landless. Looking to do more work with the poor, they accepted an invitation from the Ganjam district administration to work with Adivasi communities in the district. The original plan was to develop a dairy cooperative. The team soon realized that working on dairy development will not benefit the tribal communities. Mobilization for rights & development: 1979 onwards The Kondh tribe of the Kerandimal hills in Ganjam district were suffering at the hands of liquor merchants and from land alienation. The Kerandimal Gana Sangathan was mobilized as a movement of the Adivasi community to obtain their rights to address the development needs of the villages. The Adivasi Bhumi Adhikar Sangha, a peoples‚Äô movement in Thuamul Rampur block of Kalahandi, successfully resisted the move to convert tribal agricultural lands into tea plantations and were able to retain control over their land. The organisation then expanded its work to cover areas in Gajapati and Kalahandi districts working with Saura and Kondh tribes. The Integrated Tribal Development Programme supported village communities in community health, non- formal education, small savings and forest protection. Village Water & Sanitation Committees have been supported, to anchor, own and, manage community access to safe sanitation and water. VWSCs have been the key community institution interface for Gram Vikas since 1998. Education: 1982 onwards In remote tribal villages, government schools either did not exist or were not functioning. Education levels were very poor and the exploitation of people because illiteracy was high. Gram Vikas started balwadis, non-formal education centres and adult literacy programme in the Villages. Soon it became clear that NFE would never give tribal children the opportunity to join the mainstream education system and fully reach their potential. To meet this need, Kerandimal Middle Education School, a residential school for tribal children was established at Konkia, Ganjam district in 1982. The four residential schools, managed now by independent trusts, cater to more than 1200 boys and girls from remote tribal villages. Mahendratanaya Ashram School was established at Koinpur, Gajapati district in 1992. In 1995, the KME school was upgraded as the Gram Vikas Residential School. Gram Vikas Shikhya Niketan was established at Kumudabahal in Kalahandi district in 1998. Gram Vikas Vidya Vihar was started in Rudhapadar, Ganjam district in 1992. Renewable Energy: 1982 onwards Dwindling tree cover increased drudgery of women in collecting fuel for cooking. Biogas was identified as an appropriate technology alternative to address this. Between 1983 and 1993, Gram Vikas built 54,000 biogas plants across villages of Odisha. Gram Vikas has continued to adapt, demystify and disseminate renewable energy technologies for rural development. Work in solar PV, micro-hydro and biofuels for power generation and water pumping. Natural Resource Management: 1985 onwards To address challenges to livelihood security faced by the tribal communities, due to massive deforestation, Gram Vikas initiated the Social forestry Programme in 1985. About 10,000 hectares of private & community wasteland were brought under fruit, fuel & timber yielding species in Ganjam, Gajapati & Kalahandi districts. The tribals of Odisha practice shifting or slash-burn cultivation on hill slopes. Reduced access to common land due to stringent laws resulted in reduced rotation cycles in this practice and the degradation of land. Horticulture interventions and integrated land and water management measures were adopted to address this. Recurring droughts in the region also prompted focus on land and water management based on watershed principles. Water harvesting structures, soil conservation measures and drainage line treatment were taken up on a ridge-to-valley principle. Work on natural resource management also expanded to include the chronic drought-prone areas of Bolangir and Bargarh districts. Habitat Development: 1995 onwards Enabling rural communities to lead a dignified life meant supporting improvements in the physical living environment. Regular natural hazards like cyclone affect lives in coastal Odisha, causing damage to homes and property. Gram Vikas supports rural communities to build cost-effective, disaster-proof houses; community buildings and facilities such as schools, grain banks, roads, drainage etc. Water & Sanitation: 1994 onwards The high levels of morbidity caused by pollution of drinking water sources through improper disposal of human waste need to be addressed through a community-managed, all- inclusive mechanism. The Rural Health & Environment Programme was developed by Gram Vikas in 1995 through wide consultations with village communities in different parts of Odisha. Activities Since its inception, Gram Vikas has worked on a variety of development issues, including biogas promotion, community forestry, rural habitat development, and education. Since 2019, Gram Vikas has been working on six focus areas which are water, livelihoods, sanitation & hygiene, habitat & technologies, village institutions and education. Water Gram Vikas mobilises and supports village communities to build and manage their own piped water supply systems and ensure continuous availability of clean water for drinking and domestic uses. Water integrated with sanitation facilities enable households to adopt safe sanitation practices and reduce drudgery for women. Awareness, knowledge and processes to ensure sustainability of water sources lead to communities becoming water secure in the long run. Livelihoods Gram Vikas ensures the sustainability of land and forest resources, skills people and creates diversified and secure income sources. Tribal communities access their rights over forests. They gain new knowledge in using natural resources thereby improving the land quality and making it more productive. Sanitation and Hygiene The organisation motivates communities to adopt safe sanitation and hygiene behaviour and helps them with building household infrastructure. This integrated water and sanitation model reduces incidences of water-borne diseases and lowers malnutrition rates thereby keeping children and families healthy. Access to private, safe toilets and bathrooms with water affords women dignity and reduces the daily drudgery of fetching and carrying water. Habitat and Technologies The organisation has been promoting the use of renewable and appropriate technologies in energy and housing. Together with communities, they build disaster-resistant houses making lives secure during natural disasters. Sustainable energy solutions bring water to and light up households in remote off-grid tribal villages. Village Institutions Gram Vikas has been building village-level capabilities, structures and processes to enable stronger self-governance by the communities. The design of these structures and the principles of the processes ensure that women participate and lead. Community institutions take the leadership to influence local government decisions and stake claims to their rightful share in the resources deployed locally. Education The organisation supports Gram Vikas residential schools to provide high-quality and technology up-to-date education for children from Adivasi communities. Children go back to their communities as role models and inspire other families to educate their children. The special focus on girls results in equal or more number of girls, from communities that have historically had few educated girls, completing school. Outreach Gram Vikas‚Äô work has reached 1700 villages, supporting 600,000 people. The organisation‚Äôs work has ensured the 2,11,907 women have access to safe, private bathrooms with running water and 54,000 families have renewable energy sources for cooking. Work with village communities has resulted in 10,000 hectares of wasteland being regenerated for natural resources-based livelihoods.

The National Court of Justice ruled, in May 2008, that there had been 4,882 votes illegally cast for Potape in his election and that as a consequence, the election for the Komo Magarima Open Seat was void and that Potape was not elected. Potape was subsequently re-elected as the Member for Komo-Margarima, for the United Resources Party, in a December 2008 by-election. 2011 Fraud Allegations Potape was arrested and charged by the government appointed Investigation Task Force Sweep, on one count of conspiracy to defraud the State and another count of misappropriation in November 2011. The charges relate to payments of PGK60,000 personally paid to Potape by the Komo Magarima District while he was chairman of the Joint District Planning and Budget Priority Committee. The sitting allowance payments were found to be in excess of those approved by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.

The sculpture was finished in 2015 and is a part of the dialogue project The children of Abraham, also by Galschiot.  Overview  Model of sculpture Each one of the 14 letters are made up of stabbed bronze books, stacked 2.5 meters high and forming a closed circle 9 meters wide. The books are put on a plinth, which is 1 meter tall. The books are stacked on each other to form individual letters, but separately so that one character is built of Korans, another of Bibles, and another of the Torah. Each book is a model of an original religious book, made in wax by hand. The books, of all sizes and forms, are stacked irregularly, so the sculpture appears with a slightly shaky expression. As there are only 14 letters and 3 religions, one religion will have only 4 letters but they will be bigger than the others. Some of the letters exhibited in Jens Galschiot's gallery. On the outside of the circle directly on the individual books are posted small signs. On each of these are engraved quotations from the book of which each letter is constructed. Some of the texts are in the original language, while others are in English. These quotes are the 'good' ones, that express a humane approach to issues such as reconciliation, forgiveness, women's rights, care for the weak, equality, wisdom, beauty, compassion, faith, hope, charity, etc. On the inside of the circle is engraved the corresponding negation of a humane attitude which is found in the same book. There are quotes concerning persecution and intolerance with regard to religion, gender and race, i.e. \\"A woman must obey her husband\\", \\"must be silent at public gatherings\\", \\"must wear veils\\", etc. The whole letter structure is placed on a dark ring which is attached to a sort of newspaper text, where the religious quotes are continuously displayed. It has the advantage that visitors can get quotes in their own languages, and can also see and read quotes without having to go all the way towards the sculpture to read the engraved bronze patches. There is only one entrance through to of the letters (the F and the U) above with a sign says \\"Welcome\\". But when you come from the inside of the circle, one can only get out of the same opening, where there is a sign saying \\"NO EXIT\\".  Exhibitions  The sculpture was exhibited at Silkeborg Bad in January 2015, where 13.000 guests visited the centre to see the exhibition. The sculpture was scheduled to be exhibited at the City Hall Square in Copenhagen in March 2016.  Symbolism  Model of Fundamentalism sculpture According to Jens Galschi√∏t, the idea of the statue is to provoke the following realizations. * The crucial point in religion is not the literal wording of the religious books, but rather how they are interpreted and by whom. * All religions contain contradictory texts, and could be used to justify both the most brutal and the noblest deeds. * Many people get caught by the beautiful quotes, but end up suffering the bad ones. * You must break the rule (the plate \\"NO EXIT\\") to get out of the circle, which symbolizes that when you have only entered into a fundamentalist interpretation of religion, it is hard to get out because the exit would be an offense against \\"God's rules\\". Jens Galschi√∏t also states \\"the symbolism can of course be interpreted differently\\".

The book, an eight-week New York Times bestseller, was adapted for the screen by writer and director Nick Tucker. As the book's title indicates, several outspoken left- wing politicians and other public figures are profiled, and evidence is presented for the alleged hypocrisy seen in the disparity between what the individuals do and what they advocate publicly. Film content The intent of the film is to expose the hypocrisy of left-wing public figures like Hillary Clinton, Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, Ted Kennedy and Al Gore, by catching them in the act of doing things that they oppose. Al Gore, for example, who \\"insists\\" that Americans drastically reduce their carbon footprint, is shown to use nearly twenty times the amount of electricity as an average American household. Michael Moore, staunch anti-capitalist is shown to have significant investments in the stock market, including stock in companies like Halliburton, Pfizer, Merck, and \\"other companies he vilifies in his films\\". When Tucker brings a cake to Moore's residence to discuss the matter with him in person, Moore calls the police instead. While \\"declaring war\\" on mortgage lending abuses, Hillary Clinton is accused to have engaged in predatory lending scheme with her husband President Bill Clinton known as the Whitewater controversy, in which more than half the people bought land from the Clintons in the Whitewater development project never received a property deed. Screenings and reception The film was an official selection of several film festivals upon its release in 2008, including the Sacramento Film and Music Festival, the Newport Beach Film Festival, and the Southern California Business Film Festival at USC, and received largely positive reviews from critics and viewers, being described as a \\"hard-hitting documentary\\" that still retains its humor, making it \\"fun and fast-paced\\". In an interview with journalist and film critic Christian Toto, Tucker how influential Michael Moore's films were in his own development as a filmmaker, and comments on how the film uses Michael Moore-like guerrilla filmmaking to Michael Moore's disadvantage. Tucker calls the Michael Moore segment \\"an homage\\" to the master.

These stirrups (shitanaga abumi) were designed to enable the rider to stand and shoot easily from the saddle.

The system originated in several predecessor roads beginning c. 1890, incorporated in 1904, and ran under its own name to 1929. It merged into the Great Northern Railway and later, the Burlington Northern Railroad, which operated some roads into the 1980s. History Spokane streetcar crossing Latah Creek, 1890 One of the earliest components of Spokane's early interurban system was the Spokane and Montrose Street Railway, a narrow-gauge system with the distinction of being the first motorized street railway in Spokane. Its owner, in 1893, was Francis H. Cook (1851‚Äì1920). Cook, financially embarrassed by the Panic of 1893, sold the line to a group of Spokane businessmen headed by Jay P. Graves (1859‚Äì1948) in 1902. (Prior to this Graves and his partners had bought Cook's foreclosed land holdings in the Spokane area.) Graves and partners from Portland, Oregon, reorganized the Spokane and Montrose as the Spokane Traction Company on February 1, 1903, incorporated it as the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad Company in 1904, and rebuilt it as a standard gauge line. The routes were extended through various areas of Spokane, including Corbin Park, Hillyard and Lincoln Heights. Initially, power for the line was purchased from the Washington Water Power Company. However, in 1909, Graves built a hydroelectric dam at Nine Mile Falls, Washington. This went on to power not only Spokane Traction and the Spokane and Inland Empire, but also sold surplus power locally. During this same period, Idaho Lumberman Frederick A. Blackwell (1852‚Äì1922) organized the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene and Spokane Railway. Operating in conjunction with the Graves' lines in 1903 it formed a route between Spokane and Lake Coeur d'Alene in northern Idaho. Together, Graves and Blackwell developed properties along this line. \\"To increase summer and holiday ridership,\\" historian Laura Arksey notes, \\"Graves and Blackwell opened beaches and amusement parks on Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, Hayden, and Liberty lakes.\\" Blackwell and Graves, together with James J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway, pushed the interurban lines to the south into the Palouse Country, eventually reaching Colfax, Washington, and Moscow, Idaho. This extension was operated under the name Spokane and Inland Empire. In 1908, Spokane Traction was sold to the Spokane and Inland Empire, but operated as a separate division. Hill purchased the Spokane and Inland Empire in 1909, retaining Graves as local president. Spokane and Inland Empire gradually reduced electric-powered passenger operations. According to the Spokane Spokesman-Review, the Spokane and Inland Empire was folded into the Great Northern Railway in 1929. Spokane Traction and its competing passenger lines operated by Washington Water Power were merged in 1922, forming Spokane United Railways. This company began a slow conversion to bus service, ending electric rail operations in 1936. The last electric line run to Moscow was recorded in April, 1939, and the last electric line run to Coeur d'Alene came in July, 1940. In his history of the Spokane and Inland Empire, author Clive Carter asserts that although the interurban lines were financially unstable and expensive to operate, the outright purchase was warranted due to the large traffic the lines fed into the Great Northern system. This thinking led Hill to his purchase of the lines in 1909. However, following the Burlington Northern Railroad merger of 1970, the old interurban system was unprofitable and/or redundant (much of it was paralleled by routes of the former Northern Pacific Railway) and the Spokane and Inland Empire system was scrapped almost in its entirety between 1970 and 1985.

He makes monumental sculptures and installations of found objects. Biography Zwarjes lives and Works in Leiden. He studied at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague where he graduated in 2008. At his final graduation exhibition, Zwartjes impressed the audience with his installation The Laboratory Of Life about a post-apocalyptic world in which science, religion, and art come together. With the work Zwartjes gained a good reputation. Since 2008 his work has been on show in several exhibitions, including a solo in the Cobra Museum in Amstelveen. Publication by the Cobra Museum voor Moderne Kunst in Amstelveen in occasion of the exhibition Exodus Work Zwartjes creates environments, demarcated spaces in which a variety of mythological narratives take place. The installations are made of damaged, half decayed materials and objects that Zwartjes collects during his journeys through the city. Zwartjes sees these carefully assembled attributes, such as a shopping cart, a wooden barrel, old blankets and a gas mask, as the leftover products of a modern society in which people often feel lost. Together with a number of life-size figures, these materials make up the decor for a mythological journey of discovery. In continuation of The laboratory of Life, Zwartjes made Exodus (2009). The installation depicts an apocalyptic tale of a degenerated tribe of cloned beings, which wanders through a desolate landscape in search of deliverance and rebirth. They are routed and driven away by higher power in the form of an all-powerful computer, which has been given them the order to build a tabernacle according to meticulous guidelines: a sacred domain through which the people can be in touch with a higher power. The task of building a sanctuary is a reference to the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament. In the chapters 25-31, 35-40 of the book, God orders the building of a tabernacle in the desert in order to inhabit it and be in the midst of his chosen community. With the exact materials, their measurements and their order of succession, God has dictated the creation of his sanctuary down to the minutest detail. Zwartjes sets about his work in exactly the same way. Zwartjes selects the specific building blocks for his environments with great care. During his meanderings through the city, the artist seeks suitable waste materials. For every find, Zwartjes weighs whether or not this object meets the criteria he has already formulated for himself. Exodus is a depiction of a reality in which everyday life, fantasy and current events are all interwoven. On the one hand the installation is a physical place, the manifestations of a mythological journey generated in the mind of Izaak Zwartjes. On the other hand, this collection of objects and materials offers a space in which to reflect on our individual and collective identities, on the state in which humanity finds itself and the role that we fulfill in this society. In October 2011 Izaak Zwartjes made a pilgrimage from Leiden to Venray on a self-made car with a small engine. In Venray he stayed for a month in the Odapark to build a cathedral with the objects and materials he found on his journey. The result was shown in the exhibition Basic Construction in the Odapark.

Dialogue Kenya The toll of the 2007 Post-election violence included approximately 1,500 deaths, 3,000 rapes, and 300,000 people left internally displaced. The most severe episode of this conflict unfolded over 59 days between Election Day, 27 December 2007 and 28 February 2008. A political compromise was reached that saw the two conflicting parties sign a National Accord, following the mediation efforts by the African Union Panel of Eminent African Personalities chaired by Mr. Kofi Annan.Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Monitoring Project. south.co.ke Background Despite the reputation of the Rift valley as the cradle of humanity and positive co- existence, the peoples living there suffered through mass human rights violations in the later part of the 20th century. The mass violence in Kenya occurred throughout a period of over 40 years making it difficult to define concretely as post-election violence. To understand the events following the 1992 and 2007 elections in Kenya, one must first understand the complicated ethnic makeup of the Kenyan state. The two tribes primarily involved in the political violence are the Kikuyu people (22 percent of the 2008 Kenyan population) and the Kalenjin people (12 percent of the 2008 Kenyan population), however many other smaller tribes also inhabit Kenya. These ethnic tensions originate in events occurring before independence when British colonists forced the Kalenjin pastoral tribe off their land to develop the Rift Valley agriculturally. With the colonists came Kikuyu farmers to work as sharecroppers in the British fields. Continued competition for economic wealth and power also drove the two tribes apart. Later when selecting government officials after independence in 1963, the tension between these two tribes increased as, Jomo Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, became president and Daniel Moi, a Kalenjin, became vice-president. After Kenyatta's death, Moi took power and tightened his hold on Kenya through censoring and human rights violations. In 1991 a constitutional reform passed allowing for multipartyism in Kenya. Shortly after in 1992 the first multi-party election since independence took place. Moi won the elections but many doubted the legitimacy of his victory. Violence ensued as Kalenjin supporters of Moi raped, killed, and displaced Kikuyu opposition supporters. Despite Kalenjin attacks on Kikuyu making up the majority of the ethnic violence in Kenya, ethnic conflicts between tribes remained much more complicated. This violence persisted long after the 1992 election with postelection violence reports in 1998, 2002, and 2007. Similar to the 1992 election, in December 2007 incumbent president Mwai Kibaki won an election called ‚Äúdeeply flawed‚Äù by observers.Jeffrey Gettleman (31 January 2008) \\"Official Sees kenyan Ethnic Cleansing\\". The New York Times The Kalenjin, who supported the opposition leader Raila Odinga, burned down the houses and hacked to death Kikuyus who supported Mr. Kibaki. Weeks after the election, Kikuyus violently took revenge forcing other ethnic groups out of Kikuyu dominated areas. This post election violence took the lives of over 800 people and displaced at least 300,000.T. Craig Murphy, \\"A Comparative Analysis of Violence in Kenya\\", University of Denver Portfolio.\\"Kenya: Ethnic fighting between Kikuyu and Kalenjin in the Rift Valley (1998‚Äì1999),\\" The UN Refugee Agency, 3 August 1999. 1992 Post-election violence President Daniel Arap Moi in 1979 The 1992 multiparty General Elections were riddled with irregularities with some opposition candidates even being physically prevented from presenting their nomination papers. The incumbent, then President Daniel Arap Moi, campaign freely all over the country while other party leaders could not. Where the opposition could not campaign freely, President Moi traversed the country using government resources. Moreover, he enjoyed a monopoly of media coverage from the official broadcaster, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). In addition, the Electoral Commission was made up of presidential appointees whose loyalty to the incumbent was never in doubt. The most notorious instance of interference with the electoral process was the 1988 General Elections where many losing candidates were declared winners. The then sole ruling party, KANU, had already secured the monopoly for political power through a constitutional amendment in 1982 that made it the sole political party. In the 1991 clashes, non-Kalenjin and non-Maasai ethnic groups were ‚Äúattacked, their houses set on fire, their properties looted and in certain instances, some of them were killed or severely injured with traditional weapons like bows and arrows, spears, pangas, swords and clubs.‚Äù In its investigations, witnesses told the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, (KNCHR), that violent clashes between the Kalenjin, on the one hand, and the Kikuyu and Kisii on the other, began in 1992. These clashes pitted these groups along ethnic lines as well as on political lines. In 1992, the Kalenjin were overwhelmingly members of the then ruling party, the Kenya African National Union, (KANU). President Daniel Arap Moi, a member of the Kalenjin community, was the President of KANU and the country. He was opposed to the introduction of multi-party politics in the country and the existence of opposition political parties particularly in the Rift Valley. Many non- Kalenjin and non-Maasai communities in the Rift Valley supported the then budding opposition parties. The Akiwumi report on the 1992 clashes reported that the provincial administration was partisan in its support of the then KANU government and against those considered to be opposed to KANU in the Rift Valley. In 1992 the provincial administration also showed open partisanship in favour of KANU.doc.pdf \\"On the Brink of the Precipice: A Human Rights Account of Kenya's Post-2007 Election Violence\\". Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, 15 August 2008. 1997 Post-election violence Kenyan Coat of Arms In December 1997, Kenyans went to the polls to elect members of parliament and the country's president. The elections were conducted in the glare of international publicity, not least because the international community was seriously concerned about whether the elections would be free and fair. Despite evidence of electoral irregularities, political violence and a legal framework which favoured the incumbent government, observers of the elections endorsed the resulting victory of President Moi and the Kenya African National Union (KANU) as being an expression of the will of the people. In the wake of the elections, there rapidly followed a waning of international interest in political developments in Kenya. This was despite the fact that within a month of the elections, politically motivated ethnic 'clashes' erupted in Rift Valley Province. The violence left hundreds of people dead or injured, and thousands of others displaced from their homes and living in makeshift shelters. It was clear that this violence was following a pattern similar to that encountered during previous outbreaks of conflict in Kenya between 1991 and 1994 ‚Äì prior to and after the country's first multi-party elections in 1992‚Äî in which predominantly Kalenjin supporters of KANU attacked members of ostensibly ‚Äòpro-opposition‚Äô ethnic groups. The important difference between then and now was that for the first time, members of a ‚Äòpro-opposition‚Äô ethnic group, the Kikuyus, were organising and actively fighting back. Although the 1997 elections passed off with less violence than had been the case in 1992, events in January 1998 put paid to any hopes that political violence might be a thing of the past in Kenya. On the night of 11 January 1998, some members of the Pokot and Samburu ethnic groups raided the home of a Kikuyu widow at a place called Mirgwit in the Laikipia District of the Rift Valley Province. The raiders raped the woman and stole some livestock from the household. A group of Kikuyu men followed the raiders but, having failed to catch up with them, entered a Samburu compound where, in retaliation, they mutilated livestock that they found there. Mutilation of livestock is highly taboo for pastoralists such as the Samburu and Pokot. Accordingly, it was almost inevitable that there would be some kind of response by the owners of the livestock. On the night of 13 January 1998, some Pokot and Samburu men attacked Kikuyu communities in the Magande, Survey, Motala, Milimani and Mirgwit areas of Ol Moran in Laikipia. It appears that the attackers were armed not only with spears, bows and arrows, but also with guns. It was claimed that some of the attackers were dressed in military-type clothing. It has been estimated that over 50 Kikuyus were killed during these attacks and over 1000 others fled the area and sought refuge at the Roman Catholic Church at Kinamba, from where they were later relocated to temporary shelters at Sipili and Ol Moran. On 21 January, about 70 unidentified people invaded three farms in Njoro including one belonging to the newly elected DP Member of Parliament for Molo Constituency, Kihika Kimani. Three days later, groups of what local residents described as Kalenjins attacked Kikuyus in parts of Njoro in the same constituency. There were varying explanations given for these attacks. One version of events blamed them on the refusal of local Kikuyu traders to supply goods and services to Kalenjins in response to the events in Laikipia. Another suggested that this was simply an unprovoked attack on Kikuyus by local Kalenjin youths. The attack on Kikuyus on 24 January provoked a counter-attack by a group of apparently wellorganised Kikuyus, who on 25 January attacked Kalenjin residents of Naishi/Lare in Njoro. According to police reports, 34 Kikuyus and 48 Kalenjins were killed during these initial attacks and over 200 houses were burnt down. Hundreds of people from both communities were displaced by the fighting, and many of them fled to temporary 'camps' at Kigonor, Sururu, Larmudiac mission and Mauche. During its visit to Kenya the joint mission witnessed the very poor conditions in which displaced people in these camps were living. Sporadic fighting continued during February and March 1998. By 11 March, police reports were estimating that at least 127 people had been killed since the 'clashes' had begun in January.Daily Nation, 11 March 1998.Edge Kanyongolo (December 1998) \\"Kenya: Post-election political violence\\". Article 19. 2007 Post-election violence Whereas between 1992 and 2002 most election related violence occurred during the pre-election phase at the time of voter registration, party campaigns and nominations, the 2007 elections were characterised by excessive violence, and crimes against humanity, especially after the declaration of Mwai Kibaki of the Party of National Unity (PNU) as president in the contested results. The 2007‚Äì08 post- election violence shook the nation because of its spread, speed and ruthlessness. The closely contested presidential election was characterised by unrealistic promises, fragmentation, balkanisation, media hype and strong expressions of ethnic nationalism. Inspired and propelled by the rejection of the 2005 Referendum on a government sponsored constitution, the main opposition party went full throttle to wrest power form the incumbent in the general elections.Kimani Kjogu, Healing the Wound: Personal Narrative About the 2007 Post-Election Violence (Nairobi: Twaweza Communications, 2009). The 2007‚Äì2008 Kenyan crisis refers to a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis that erupted in Kenya after incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner of the presidential election held on 27 December 2007. Supporters of Kibaki's opponent, Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement, alleged electoral manipulation. This was widely confirmed by international observers, perpetrated by both parties in the election.\\"Kenya rivals agree to share power\\". BBC News. 28 February 2008. Archived from the original on 29 February 2008. Retrieved 1 March 2008Wangui Kanina (18 September 2008) \\"Kenya's election seen as badly flawed\\". Reuters. In part due to the ethnic and geographic diversity of the ODM coalition, no one narrative can explain the reaction of opposition supporters to the announcement of Kibaki's swearing-in. In addition to staging several nonviolent protests, opposition supporters went on a violent rampage in several parts of the country, most noticeably in Odinga's homeland of Nyanza Province and the slums of Nairobi, part of his Langata constituency. Police shot a number of demonstrators, including a few in front of TV news cameras, causing more violence directed toward the police.\\"Police kill unarmed civilian\\". KTN. 16 January 2008. Retrieved 2008-07-11. (AFP) ‚Äì 26 January 2008 (26 January 2008). \\"AFP: Politician's portrait marks border in Kenyan slum\\". Afp.google.com. Retrieved 2010-05-01. Targeted ethnic violence (as opposed to violent protests) escalated and at first was directed mainly against Kikuyu people ‚Äì the community of which Kibaki is a member ‚Äì living outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the Rift Valley Province. This violence peaked with the killing of over 30 unarmed civilians in a church near Eldoret on New Years Day. Tensions in the Rift Valley have caused violence in several previous Kenyan elections, most notably in the 1992 Kenyan Elections. Some of the Kikuyu also engaged in retaliatory violence against groups supportive of Odinga, primarily Luos and Kalenjin, especially in the areas surrounding Nakuru and Naivasha. In Mombasa, Muslim Kenyans took to the streets to protest the electoral manipulations and air their own grievances, though ethnic tensions played much less of a role in these protests. Looters also struck a number of stores in Mombasa. The slums of Nairobi saw some of the worst violence, some of this ethnically motivated attacks, some simple outrage at extreme poverty, and some the actions of criminal gangs. The violence continued sporadically for several months, particularly in the Rift Valley. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in the country nearly a month after the election, and successfully brought the two sides to the negotiating table. On 28 February 2008, Kibaki and Odinga signed a power-sharing agreement called the National Accord and Reconciliation Act, which establishes the office of prime minister and creates a coalition government.[1] The power- sharing Cabinet, headed by Odinga as Prime Minister, was eventually named on 13 April, after lengthy negotiations over its composition;\\"Kenya unveils 40-seat cabinet\\", Al Jazeera, 13 April 2008. it was sworn in on 17 April.\\"Odinga sworn in as Kenya PM\\", Al Jazeera, 17 April 2008. The National Accord The two parties agreed to tackle four main agenda items to end the political crisis and address its underlying causes. * Agenda Item 1: Immediate Action to Stop Violence and Restore Fundamental Rights. * Agenda Item 2: Addressing the Humanitarian Crisis, and Promoting Healing and Reconciliation. * Agenda Item 3: How to Overcome the Political Crisis (power sharing). * Agenda Item 4: Tackling Long-term Issues.  The TJRC  The TJRC (Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya) is part of the accountability component of Agenda Four of the National Accord signed in 2008. By addressing the cause and effects of historical injustices and gross violations of human rights the TJRC will contribute towards national unity, reconciliation, and healing. The Commission is established by an Act of Parliament (Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission Act no. 6 of 2008) to investigate the gross human rights violations and other historical injustices in Kenya between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008. Agenda Four of the National Dialogue and Reconciliation process of 2008 that relates to long term issues and reforms provides the framework for transitional justice, with the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission driving the transitional justice agenda. Kenya's civil society have called for a truth, justice, and reconciliation process since 2002 when the NARC Government came into power after the twenty four-year rule of President Moi. In 2003, a Government appointed Task Force recommended establishment of a Truth Justice and reconciliation Commission. Had this recommendation been acted on then, perhaps the country might have avoided the post December 2007 election violence witnessed.  Mandate of the TJRC  The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya has the ability to investigate, analyse, and report on what happened between 1963 and 2008 in regards to gross violations of human rights, economic crimes, illegal acquisition of public land, marginalisation of communities, ethnic violence, the context in which the crimes occurred, and educate the public about its work. The TJRC does not, however, have the power to prosecute. They can recommend prosecutions, reparations for victims, institutional changes, and amnesty in exchange for truth for perpetrators who did not commit gross human rights violations. The TJRC investigates, analyses, and reports on human rights abuses, economic crimes, illegal acquisition of land, marginalisation of communities, and ethnic violence. In terms of justice, lack of retributive justice has been a source of concern for many Kenyans. Though the commission can recommend prosecutions, there has been a long-standing culture of impunity in the country, which threatens to keep political leaders safe from prosecution. However, the commission has focused on justice in terms of recognition and distribution. The commission has sought to give victims and perpetrators equal voice in hearings, and have included hearings where children may share their stories, with guidance from counselors. Recommendations for redistribution of power and resources has been a focus of the mandate, as major conflicts have arisen due to imbalances in power, land, and resources between ethnic groups. Additionally, the commission has focused on educating the country about the history of violence, and emphasises promoting reconciliation through revealing of truth. The public is invited and encouraged to participate to fulfill the goal of educating the public. Members of the public may attend the public hearings, and can volunteer to assist the TJRC in fulfilling its mandate. They may also make submissions to the commission regarding the TJRC mandate. Victims may apply for reparations if they qualify.  Objectives  In its work the Commission will pursue the following goals and objectives: * Truth: by establishing an accurate, complete and historical record of human rights violations and historical injustices, and educating the public * Justice: Criminal justice, restorative justice, social justice through recommendations for prosecution, amnesty, reparations * Peace and National Unity * Healing and Reconciliation (national and individual) * Restoration of the human dignity of victims and perpetrators. Specific objectives for investigating human rights abuses: * To establish an accurate, complete and historical record of violations and abuses of human rights, committed between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008, such as: * Abductions, disappearances, detentions, torture, murder, massacres, extrajudicial killings, crimes of sexual nature against female victims and expropriation of property suffered by any person. * To investigate the gross violations of international human rights law and determine those responsible for their commission. * To investigate and provide redress of crimes of sexual nature against female victims. * To investigate the context, causes and circumstances under which the gross violations of human rights occurred. * To identify actors who purported to have acted on behalf of any public body responsible for the gross violations of human rights, and persons who should be prosecuted for being responsible. * To identify and specify the victims of the gross violations of human rights and their where abouts. * To facilitate the granting of conditional amnesty to persons who make full disclosure of all the relevant facts, relating to the gross violations of human rights and economic crimes, and who comply with the requirements of the TJRC Act. Specific Objectives for Investigating Economic/Public Land Crimes * To investigate economic crimes including grand corruption and the exploitation of natural resources and the action taken, if any. * To inquire into the irregular and illegal allocation of public land, in terms of repossession or determination of cases. * To inquire into and establish the reality or otherwise of perceived economic marginalisation of communities. * To inquire into misuse of public institutions for political objectives. * To educate and engage the public and give sufficient publicity to the work of the Commission. Specific objectives for the recommendation process Make Recommendations in Response to Human Rights Abuses in Terms of: * Reparation and rehabilitation policy or measures aimed at granting reparations and restoring the civil and human dignity of the victims. * Prevention of violations and abuses of human rights through institutional, administrative and legislative measures. * Granting of conditional amnesty to persons who make full disclosure. * Prosecution of perpetrators or persons involved. * Promotion of healing, reconciliation and coexistence among ethnic communities. Make recommendations as to: * The reforms and other measures needed to achieve the object of the Commission, and address any specific concern and actions to be taken. * A mechanism or framework and an institutional arrangement in that connection, for the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. * The implementation of the reports of the relevant commissions of inquiry. * Repossession or determination of cases relating to public land acquired through irregular and illegal allocation. * Addressing the real or perceived economic marginalisation of communities. For information visit TJRC Kenya website.http://www.tjrckenya.org Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya The Commissioners The commissioners of the TJRC are both local and international, and there has been controversy regarding the legitimacy of the commission due to its commissioners. Some of the commissioners and people involved with the commission were involved with the previous government, and, consequently, people question the impartiality of the commission. Nevertheless, the commissioners offer different types of expertise that they can apply to Kenya's TJRC. * Bethuel Kiplagat was the chairman of the commission. Originally, President Mwai Kibaki picked him to head the commission. However, Kiplagat later stepped down in November 2010 after being pressured to resign by fellow commissioners, civil society groups, human rights activists and the general public since he was part of a meeting of the Kenyan Intelligence Committee held less than forty eight hours prior to the security operation that resulted in the Wagalla massacre, which according to the UN was the worst massacre in Kenya's history. The TJRC investigated the massacre and made a finding that Kiplagat should be barred from further public offices and investigated for possible complicity in the massacre. It is the first time a truth commission has made a negative finding concerning its own Chairman. In addition to the Wagalla Massacre, the Commission investigated two additional violations to which Kiplagat was linked: the murder of Kenya's Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko (politician); Kiplagat was also accused of land grabbing while he acted as Permanent Secretary during former President Moi's regime. In April 2012, Kiplagat was reinstated as TJRC chairman after the Justice Minister Eugene Wamalwa brokered a truce between him and the other commissioners.Lordrick Mayabi (11 April 2012) Kiplagat, TJRC foes call a truce. capitalfm.co.ke Previously, Kiplagat worked with the National Christian Council of Kenya, served as an Ambassador to France, the High Commissioner to UK, and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kiplagat was also the chair of the board of the African Medical and Research Foundation and worked with Kenya's Special Envoy to the Somalia peace process.Bethuel Kiplagat. africa-confidential.com * Tecla Namachanja Wanjala acted as the chairperson in Kiplagat's absence, and she has been involved in peacemaking in Kenya during the 1991‚Äì92 and 1997 violence. She has participated in several different countries' conflict resolution processes, including Sudan, Rwanda and Ethiopia, and she headed the Regional Party for Peace in East and Central Africa Program, which seeks to increase African leadership in conflict management in the Horn of Africa. She trained 500 workers for the Nairobi Peace Initiative, consulted for Japan International Cooperation Agency, and journeyed with internally displaced persons in Kenya during the ethnic clashes of 1993‚Äì1995. She organised aid for over 40,000 survivors of the violence. She is from Kenya. * Ahmed Sheikh Farah, a commissioner from Kenya, has worked internationally for the Kenya Armed Forces. He has experience in conflict prevention, management, and resolutions at both the regional and international levels. * Berhanu Dinka, a commissioner from Ethiopia, has 27 years of experience working in the Ethiopian Foreign Service and in the United Nations. He also acted as an Ethiopian ambassador and headed the Department of Africa and Middle East Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After attaining the rank of Under Secretary-General in the UN, Commissioner Dinka represented the Secretary General during negotiations to resolve the conflict in DR Congo. * Gertrude Chawatama, a commissioner from Zambia, has over 19 years of professional judicial experience. She is a judge with the High Court of Zambia, a board member of the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute based in Canada, a council member of the Commonwealth Magistrates and Judges Association for the East, Central and Southern African region, and chairperson of the Juvenile Justice Forum in Zambia. * Margaret Shava, a commissioner from Kenya, has worked in law, management, and peace-building for over 17 years. She is an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and has practised law with a leading law firm in Nairobi. Commissioner Shava has experience in the economic sectors, modern corporate and human resources management, and the UN. She also worked with national and international NGOs that specialise in human rights, governance, and international refugee law. * Ronald Slye, a commissioner from the United States, is a professor of law at the Seattle University School of Law. He consults, writes, and teaches on public international law and international human rights law, and is a specialist in international criminal law and transitional justice. Commissioner Slye is the author of articles on international law, human rights, and environmental and poverty law, and he is the co-author of two books on international criminal law. He is writing a book on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and its amnesty process, based on his time as one of the commission's legal consultants. He has published a book about his experience with the Kenyan Truth Commission: \\"The Kenyan TJRC: An Outsider's View from the Inside,\\" published by Cambridge University Press. A companion website established at his University makes available the Commission's Final Report, the dissent filed by the international Commissioners, and transcripts of many of the public hearings held by the Commission. The website is: https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/tjrc/. * Tom Ojienda, a commissioner from Kenya, is a former President of the East African Law Society, former Chair of the Law Society of Kenya, and Financial Secretary and Vice-President of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU). He was a consultant for the Njonjo and Ndungu Land Commissions, World Bank, USAID, ACCORD and EAC, and served as a member of the Legal and Technical Working Group in the National Land Policy formulation process. Commissioner Ojienda has written two books on land law and edited two books on democracy and constitutional change.The Commissioners. tjrckenya.org Departments The work of the TJRC is being accomplished through the work of seven different departments. * The department of Finance & Administration provides support to the commission by organising the logistical and administrative aspects of the commission's budget and finances.Finance and Administration Unit. tjrckenya.org * The department of Communications acts as the link between the commission and the public. It provides information to the media and ensures that the Kenyan population has access to the commission's proceedings.

The statement taking process provides victims with the opportunity to tell the truth about their experiences and those of close friends and relatives.  Hearings  The TJRC will conduct public and private hearings at which victims, perpetrators, experts will give testimony relating to gross violations of human rights. Individual hearings Individual hearings will focus on individual cases, and the experience of individuals with respect to violations within the mandate of the Commission. Thematic and event hearings Thematic hearings will focus on types of violations and other broad themes within the mandate of the Commission. Institutional Hearings Institutional hearings will focus on the role played by an institution or institutions with respect to violations within the mandate of the Commission  Community dialogues  The TJRC will hold discussion forums bringing together different groups across the country (ethnic; religious; chiefs; women; youth) to chart ways of establishing reconciliation, harmonious co- existence and national unity. This aspect of the TJRC‚Äôs work presents avenues for collaboration with the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), and other Agenda Four Commissions.  The final report  This is the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission‚Äôs main product. It will document the Commission‚Äôs work relating to the following aspects: * Consist of historical record of gross human rights violations * Outline the Commission‚Äôs findings and detail recommendations on: how to address past violations and injustices through reparations and prosecutions; How to prevent future violations in various ways including specific legal and institutional reforms and memorialisation. Timeline: The Commission began in August 2009 with an operational period of two years. This period includes three months prior to beginning operations for set up, and three months following as a \\"winding down\\" period. The Commission requested a 6-month extension, thus the current timeline is as follows: * Start of set up period: 3 August 2009 * Start of operational period: 3 November 2009 * End of operational period and issuing of report: 3 November 2011 * End of winding down period: 3 February 2012 A full copy of the Final Report, including the dissent submitted by the international Commissioners, can be found at https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/tjrc/. The TJRC and the International Criminal Court The International Criminal Court (ICC) became involved in Kenya when Kenya ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on 15 March 2005, which gave the ICC jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed in Kenya after the statute came into force, or July 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction only when the country in question fails to act on crimes against humanity that were perpetrated on its land. The Kenyan government created the Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (CIPEV), otherwise known as the Waki Commission, in February 2008, which was an international commission of inquiry with the aim of investigating the post-election violence that occurred in Kenya. One of the many suggestions in the official report that the Waki Commission made was that the Kenyan government establish a tribunal of both international and national judges to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the gross human rights violations. The commission gave the government a limited amount of time to agree to create a special tribunal, and made it clear that the commission would give its findings to the ICC if the government failed to establish the tribunal within the given timeframe.‚ÄúThe Waki Commission Report‚Äù. AfricaFiles, 15 October 2008. In February 2009, after the Kenyan Parliament voted against founding the tribunal and no further action was taken by the government, the Waki Commission handed over its information, including a list of those believed to be responsible for the violence, to the ICC. On 26 November 2009, the Prosecutor requested permission from the court to investigate the crimes against humanity during the post- election violence in Kenya, and was granted permission to do so by the majority of the court. After carrying out investigations against six prominent individuals believed to be responsible for the crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya decided to send four of them to trial. The government has protested the findings. It asked the UN to postpone the ICC's Kenya case, and has put up substantial resistance to the ICC.Kevin J. Kelley (19 March 2011) ‚ÄúWhy Kenya failed to defer ICC cases at Security Council‚Äù. Daily Nation. In addition, confidence in Kenya's judiciary has declined, and, as part of the National Accord made after the 2008 violence, the government has responded by launching an investigation into the judiciary. Four senior judges, Justice Samuel Bosire, Justice Joseph Gregory Nyamu, Justice Samuel Cornelius Riaga Omolo, and Justice Emmanuel Okelo O'Kubasu, were declared unfit for office by the investigation in April 2012. The two senior Court of Appeals judges, Justice Bosire and Justice Nyamu, were removed from office because of their involvement with the Goldenberg scandal trials. It is expected that more judges will be removed from office as the investigation continues. This ruling marks the beginning of the second phase of the vetting process, and the investigation may end the corruption in Kenya's own legal system. Wahome Thuku and Isaiah Lucheli (26 April 2012) ‚ÄúScandals and past rulings end careers of four senior judges‚Äù. The Standard Criticism and media coverage The relative immaturity of Kenya‚Äôs TJRC makes it difficult to evaluate the commission‚Äôs success. This immaturity however also secures a great wealth of recent discussion on the TJRC and many opinions regarding its success. For example, the vice-president of the International Center for Transitional Justice recently spoke of the International Criminal Court‚Äôs involvement in the efforts to reconcile Kenya. He commented that, ‚ÄúThis week's decision in The Hague [confirming four Kenyans must answer to charges of crimes against humanity] was welcomed peacefully across the country. It is telling that most Kenyans support the ICC and have little faith in their own judiciary, which is widely perceived as corrupt.‚Äù He called the Kenyan government to fulfill their responsibility to pursue justice at home to avoid violence after the anticipated 2012 election. Similar criticism came from the United States before Hillary Clinton‚Äôs visit in August 2009. Specifically the US criticised the use of local courts to try suspects accused of perpetrating violence. These courts, the US argued, had a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases and a reputation for corruption. Critics also question the credibility of the commissioners because of their connection to Moi's regime and its gross human rights violations. Deputy chair of the commission, lawyer Betty Murungi, resigned saying that she found it difficult to fulfill her duties when the commission leader, Bethwell Kiplagat, faced accusations. Additionally, the inability of the commission to meet its 11 November 2011 report deadline only enhanced public scepticism. The task of reconciling the people of Kenya after the series of gross human rights violations that have occurred of the past half-century requires a stable commission and a government that the people of Kenya can believe in.Paul Seils (2012) \\"ICC's Kenya decision is no cause for celebration\\".

Early life He was born in Edinburgh on 16 November 1766, into the traditionally Jacobite Stuarts of Loch Rannoch. In 1778 he was sent to London to join his elder brothers, Charles and Peter, who were in the printing business. The eldest brother Charles Stuart took play-writing. Peter Stuart (fl. 1788‚Äì1805) started the Tory paper The Oracle before 1788, and in 1788 set up The Star, which was the first London evening paper to appear regularly. Daniel and Peter lived with their sister Catherine, who in February 1789 secretly married James Mackintosh. She died in April 1796. Daniel Stuart assisted Mackintosh as secretary to the Society of the Friends of the People, for parliamentary reform. In 1794 he published a pamphlet, Peace and Reform, against War and Corruption, in answer to Arthur Young's The Example of France a Warning to Great Britain. Morning Post In 1788, Peter and Daniel Stuart undertook the printing of the Morning Post, a moderate Whig newspaper, which was then owned by Richard Tattersall, and was at a low ebb. In 1795 Tattersall disposed of it to the Stuarts; Daniel Stuart took on the management, and within two years Stuart raised the circulation of the paper from 350 a day to a thousand. Gradually he converted it into an organ of the moderate Tories. By buying in The Gazetteer and The Telegraph, good management and hiring talented writers, he made the Post a rival to the Morning Chronicle, then the top London daily. Mackintosh, who wrote regularly for it in its earlier days, introduced Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Stuart in 1797. Coleridge became a frequent contributor, and when, in the autumn of 1798, he went to Germany, Robert Southey supplied contributions in his place. On Coleridge's return it was arranged that he should give his whole time to the Morning Post and receive Stuart's largest salary. Stuart took rooms for him in King Street, Covent Garden, and Coleridge told William Wordsworth that he dedicated his nights and days to Stuart (Wordsworth, Life of Wordsworth, i. 160). Coleridge introduced Charles Lamb to Stuart; but Stuart was never impressed, though Lamb wrote of himself as having been connected with the Post from 1800 to 1803. Wordsworth, unpaid, contributed some political sonnets. In August 1803 Stuart disposed of the Morning Post for ¬£25,000, when the daily circulation was at the then unprecedented rate of 4,500. The Courier Stuart had meanwhile supervised the foreign new in The Oracle, the Tory paper still owned by his brother Peter, and in 1796 he had purchased an evening paper, The Courier. He increased the daily sale of the Courier from 1,500 to 7,000. The price was 7d., and second and third editions were published daily for the first time. It circulated widely among the clergy. From 1809 to 1811 Coleridge was an intermittent contributor to Courier. An article which Stuart wrote, with Coleridge's assistance, in 1811 on the conduct of the princes in the regency question provoked a speech from the Duke of Sussex in the House of Lords. Mackintosh contributed to the Courier from 1808 to 1814, and Wordsworth wrote articles on the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Southey also sent extracts from his pamphlet on the Convention of Cintra before its publication. For his support of Henry Addington's government Stuart declined any reward. From 1811 he left the management of the Courier almost entirely in the hands of his partner, Peter Street, under whom it became a ministerial organ. In 1817 Stuart obtained a verdict against Daniel Lovell, editor of The Statesman, who had accused him of dishonestly taking money belonging to the Society of the Friends of the People. In 1822 Stuart sold his interest in the Courier. Coleridge wrote to Stuart in 1816, praising his journalism for the Courier: > It is far, very far, from hyperbole to affirm, that you did more against the > French scheme of Continental domination, than the Duke of Wellington has > done; or rather Wellington could neither have been supplied by the > Ministers, nor the Ministers supported by the Nation, but for the tone first > given, and then constantly kept up, by the plain, unministerial, anti- > opposition, anti-jacobin, anti-gallican, anti-Napoleonic spirit of your > writings, aided by the colloquial good style, and evident good sense, in > which as acting on an immense mass of knowledge of existing men and existing > circumstances, you are superior to any man I ever met with in my life > time.E. H. Coleridge (ed.), Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Volume II > (1895), p. 660. Later life Stuart gave Coleridge money at later periods. In a correspondence with Henry Coleridge, he contested statements made in print by James Gilmann and Coleridge himself, to the effect that Coleridge and his friends had been exploited by his papers and were inadequately rewarded. Stuart purchased Wykeham Park, Oxfordshire. He died on 25 August 1846 at his house in Upper Harley Street in London. He had married in 1813.

He was formerly the President of the Asian Development Bank from 1 February 2005 to 18 March 2013.  Early life  Kuroda attended University of Tokyo from 1963 to 1967, where he studied law and passed the bar examination before graduation. He joined the Ministry of Finance following graduation, and studied economics at Oxford University on a Japanese government scholarship from 1969 to 1971. He went on to hold various posts at the Ministry of Finance, culminating in the post of Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs (1999-2003). He resigned from the ministry in January 2003 and was appointed Special Advisor to the Cabinet in March 2003. From 2005 to 2013, he served as president of the Asian Development Bank.A summary of his role as president of the Asian Development Bank is in Peter McCawley, 2017, Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank, Manila: Asian Development Bank, pp. 272-273.  Bank of Japan governorship  Kuroda has been an advocate of looser monetary policy in Japan. His February 2013 nomination by the incoming government of the Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe had been expected. Also nominated at the same time were Kikuo Iwata ‚Äì \\"a harsh critic of past BOJ policies\\" ‚Äì and Hiroshi Nakaso, a senior BOJ official in charge of international affairs, as Kuroda's two deputies. The former governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, left in March 2013. 2013 \\"There is plenty of room for monetary easing\\" in Japan, Kuroda said in a February 2013 interview, adding that the BOJ could go beyond purchasing government bonds to include corporate bonds \\"or even stocks\\". The yen, which \\"has fallen 10% against the dollar since Abe began his campaign in November\\", also fell on the news of Kuroda's nomination. However, the new governor was \\"expected to use his experience as Japan‚Äôs top currency official until 2003 to rebut overseas criticism that Tokyo is using easy monetary policy to drive the yen lower, triggering a war of competitive currency devaluation\\".. Bloomberg quoted Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, as saying about Kuroda's goals: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a strong pledge from a well-intended man, but I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs going to work.\\" When Kuroda was asked the same question in his assumption of office's press conference on March 21, Kuroda said the BOJ's role is to stabilize prices, and stabilizing exchange rates is the role of the Ministry of Finance.Bank of Japan Act, Article 2; Currency and monetary control by the Bank of Japan shall be aimed at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy.Ë≤°ÂãôÁúÅË®≠ÁΩÆÊ≥ï Á¨¨‰∏âÊù° Ë≤°ÂãôÁúÅ„ÅØ„ÄÅÂÅ•ÂÖ®„Å™Ë≤°Êîø„ÅÆÁ¢∫‰øù„ÄÅÈÅ©Ê≠£„Åã„Å§ÂÖ¨Âπ≥„Å™Ë™≤Á®é„ÅÆÂÆüÁèæ„ÄÅÁ®éÈñ¢Ê•≠Âãô„ÅÆÈÅ©Ê≠£„Å™ÈÅãÂñ∂„ÄÅÂõΩÂ∫´„ÅÆÈÅ©Ê≠£„Å™ÁÆ°ÁêÜ„ÄÅÈÄöË≤®„Å´ÂØæ„Åô„Çã‰ø°È†º„ÅÆÁ∂≠ÊåÅÂèä„Å≥Â§ñÂõΩÁÇ∫Êõø„ÅÆÂÆâÂÆö„ÅÆÁ¢∫‰øù„ÇíÂõ≥„Çã„Åì„Å®„Çí‰ªªÂãô„Å®„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ He also said that BOJ's \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing\\" policy was not intend to devalue the yen, aiming to grow out of deflation by targeting inflation. Although there was opposition from developing countries, the policy was accepted by the other developed countries in the G20 summit. However, G20 members emphasized to Japanese policymakers that Japanese policy should be directed at domestic goals while highlighting the importance of a Japanese effort to reduce government debt. 2016 In early 2016 after a stretch of global market weakness, Kuroda led Japan's move into negative interest rates. The BOJ had already pushed its balance sheet from 35% to 70+% of GDP since 2013 and was continuing to buy ¬•80 trillion (over $600 billion) of securities each month. ‚ÄúRisks were growing that the slowdown in the Chinese, emerging and resource-producing countries, which has caused volatility and instability in financial markets since the beginning of the year, may hurt confidence among domestic [Japanese] companies,‚Äù Kuroda was quoted as saying at the time of the interest-rate cut.Nakamichi, Takashi, Megumi Fujikawa and Eleanor Warnock, \\"Bank of Japan Introduces Negative Interest Rates\\" (possibly subscription-only), Wall Street Journal, January 29, 2016.

Biography The son of Gaius Silius, Silius was described by the ancient sources as an intelligent, noble and attractive man.Smith, pg. 823 He had married the aristocratic Junia Lepida Silana, and had been inducted into the Senate sometime shortly before 47. During this year he demanded in the Senate the enforcement of the Lex Cincia, forbidding the acceptance of money or gifts in exchange for legal services, in an attempt to bring down his enemy, Publius Suillius Rufus, who was prosecuting many of Silius' clients.Tacitus, Annals, XI:5-6 The Senate agreed with this proposal, but before a formal motion could be put before the people, those intended to be prosecuted under this law, including Suillius Rufus, had successfully appealed to Claudius to amend the law by establishing a maximum fee that could be charged.Tacitus, Annals, XI:7 Silius was then made a consul-designate in 48 (presumably for the following year). Through the infatuation of the Empress Valeria Messalina, they had become lovers. Messalina forced him to divorce his wife to marry her, committing bigamy and marrying before witnesses, while Claudius was at Ostia. Tacitus, Annals, XI:26 Silius was childless and wanted to adopt Britannicus.Anthony A. Barrett, Agrippina: Mother of Nero, (2002), pg. 104 Tacitus, Annals, XI:26 Narcissus exposed their mock marriage and the plot to kill Claudius.Smith, pg. 824 The Emperor ordered their executions in 48. His former wife, whom he divorced in 47, Junia Silana, was a friend of Agrippina the Younger and the two later became bitter rivals. Likely due to the machinations of Agrippina, she was exiled and later died at Tarentum in 59.

Electrification of the service took place rapidly with the first converted service opening from Roker to Christ Church on 15 August 1900. The remaining services were upgraded by 1904. During the First World War Sunderland, like many other local authorities, employed women on the tramcars as conductresses.

She was allegedly the inspiration for The Beauty Song, composed by her brother Li Yannian. Biography Lady Li's brother Li Yannian was a musician for Princess Pingyang. After he performed The Beauty Song () for Emperor Wu, the Emperor asked Li Yannian if he knew of such a woman, to which Princess Pingyang responded that the song was about Li's sister. The Emperor thus requested to meet with Lady Li, and she became one of his concubines. She had one son named Bo (È´Ü). Death Lady Li as depicted in the album Gathering Gems of Beauty (Áï´È∫óÁè†ËêÉÁßÄ) It is recorded that when Lady Li became gravely ill, Emperor Wu came to visit her personally. However, she refused to allow him to see her face, citing the loss of her beauty. Upon Wudi's urging, Li went further and refused to even speak. As such, Wudi left unhappily. The lady's sisters then admonished her for not allowing the emperor to see her face. Li's reply was \\"The reason why I refused to meet the emperor was for my brothers' sake. I earned the emperor's goodwill by virtue of my good looks. Those who serve others using their looks, will lose their popularity once their looks have faded. The reason why the Emperor remembers me fondly was because of my good looks in the past. If he sees that my looks have been ravaged, he will definitely treat me with disgust, let alone remember me fondly or treat my brothers well!\\" The date of Lady Li's death is unrecorded, but is calculated to be between 104 and 101 BC, as her brother Li Guangli was sent to attack Dayuan twice during this period, and it was recorded that Lady Li had passed away before Li Guangli returned from his second expedition. Emperor Wu's profound sadness was recorded in the Han Shu. Likewise, a famous poem has been recorded as being written by the grief-stricken Emperor.M. Loewe, 53. However, although composed in the persona of Han Wudi, there is doubt as to the actual authorship of this and similar poems.Rexroth, 133 Wudi's personal grief at the loss of his beloved Lady Li is recorded in a well-known poem: Influence Due to her popularity with the Emperor, her male relatives enjoyed favor with the Emperor, but in the civil unrest between the Li family and Empress Wei Zifu's family, several of her relatives were killed or executed. Li Guangli later surrendered to the Xiongnu circa 90-89 BC. With the suicide of Emperor Wu's crown prince Liu Ju in 91 BC, her son Liu Bo was among the candidates for the title of crown prince; the title ultimately went to young Liu Fuling, who succeeded Emperor Wu as Emperor Zhao of Han. (In any case, Liu Bo predeceased his father.) Her grandson, Liu Bo's son, Prince He of Changyi, was notoriously enthroned as emperor as Emperor Zhao's successor, but was removed from his position after 27 days by Huo Guang, impeached on 1127 charges of misconduct committed after being named emperor. Afterwards, Li's grandson was not included on the official historical list of Han emperors.

Richard James has won both the British Fashion Council's Menswear Designer of the Year and Bespoke Designer of the Year awards. History The first of the \\"new establishment\\" or \\"new bespoke movement\\" of Savile Row - the new, more fashion orientated wave of tailors who moved onto the street in the nineties - Richard James is widely credited as having done much to revitalise the reputation and fortunes of what is acknowledged to be the world centre of quality tailoring.

One early supporter of Richard James, however, was established British couturier Hardy Amies who had opened his business on Savile Row in 1946. \\"Sir Hardy Amies was marvellous,\\" recalled James. \\"I well recall his chauffeur-driven car pulling up outside Richard James and Sir Hardy emerging like Lady Bracknell. He'd cast a lugubrious eye over the bright pink and acid green jackets in our window before shaking his head at us in mock disbelief. And then he smiled.\\" Richard James now has two shops on Savile Row, one of which is devoted to bespoke tailoring, and a flagship store in New York. Bespoke suits start at ¬£4,500 inclusive of VAT. The company's ready-to- wear collections are also sold worldwide through stockists such as Harrods, Selfridges, Bloomingdales, Barneys New York and Lane Crawford. House Style Richard James's tailoring has always centred on what has become known in the style press as its 'modern classic' style: one or two-button single-breasted suits with slightly longer, more waisted jackets, incorporating deep side vents and a slightly higher armhole to give a slim, definitive silhouette. The overall design philosophy is to produce classic clothing, but to push the barriers through experimenting with fabrics and making bold use of pattern and, particularly, colour. The British fashion writer and academic Colin McDowell has described James as being 'the best colourist working in menswear in London today'. Collaborations Throughout its history, Richard James has collaborated on a number of high-profile projects with a diverse number of companies and individuals, including SpongeBob SquarePants,Elton John,Spencer Tunick (picture, right), Condor Cycles, Umbro and Tretorn. Timeline 1992 The first Richard James shop opens at 37a Savile Row. Richard James's arrival is noticed by Nick Sullivan in British Esquire magazine: \\"There is an odd atmosphere these days in Savile Row. Nothing tangible, you understand. But from time to time, people stop to peer with uncertainty, with incomprehension, even with vague horror through the plate glass window of No. 37a. There's a new boy on The Row and he's causing quite a stir.\\" 1995 The Sunday Telegraph reveals that Queen Elizabeth II's cousin David Linley is measured for his Richard James suits astride his motorcycle.

It is now in the Louvre in Paris. History Bought by the Louvre in 1951 from the Schloss Fuschl Collection for 5,000,000 francs,For this collection see also refs at \\"Stefan Sch√∂rghuber\\" this work of the Flemish artist belongs to a groups of paintings in which the Italian influence is clearly visible: see for instance, the Entombment, the Nativity, the Death of the Virgin, and the Portrait of a Man. Petrus Christus, working at Bruges, continued to paint in the style of Jan van Eyck at a time when most Flemish artists had abandoned this manner in favour of Rogier van der Weyden's more dramatic and Gothic character. He seems to have visited Italy some time between 1454 and 1462, and various factors suggest that he may have travelled as far as the south of Italy: Antonello da Messina's influence on him, for example, together with the presence of paintings from his hand in Sicily as early as the 16th century, and certain affinities between his work and that of the School of Naples.G. Faggin, Petrus Christus, Fabbri Group (1966), pp. 9‚Äì12. He may possibly have contributed to the introduction of the Flemish technique of painting into Italy. The artist's early manner was dry and awkward, with a tendency towards archaism, but under the beneficial influence of Antonello his work gained in suppleness, revealing a new sense of harmony and rhythm in the compositions, a monumental conception of the figures, and a certain proud dignity of facial expression. The Louvre painting has all these characteristics: the landscape is painted in broad planes, and the diagonal arrangement of the heads and the delicate arabesque on Christ's body contribute to the subtlety of the composition. The Virgin's head is a perfect oval, in the manner of Antonello da Messina; St. John's square-cut face, with his determined jaw, recalls that artist's portraits, and the woman's head seen in profile (very rare in the work of Flemish artists) is also reminiscent of certain heads by Italian painters.J.

The film was the sixth highest grossing release at the Italian box office in the 1968/69 season.

Storia, fasti, declino e nuove prospettive, Latina, Tunu√®, 2011. Plot The Roman businessman Fausto Di Salvio can no longer stand his work and his sloppy and emotionless way of life. The chance to escape from this \\"prison\\" occurs when the news of the death of his brother- in-law, Oreste Sabbatini, known as \\"Titino\\", arrives from Africa. Fausto, with his employee Ubaldo, his firm's accountant, leaves immediately to Angola in search of Titino, a journey that will take many months of travel and will involve them in many adventures. They follow in Titino's tracks, but it seems that he cannot be found. From what they learn by speaking to people who have met him, Titino appears to be a man of many resources who has left behind him many people crazy of him, but even someone who was cheated by him and who would be glad to lay hands on him. As they lose hope that they will ever find Titino, Fausto and Ubaldo are captured by a tribe of natives who turn out to be governed by the shaman Oreste, the brother-in-law of Fausto. They propose to Titino to come back with them to Italy. After some hesitation, Titino makes up his mind to follow them to Italy, but when they are on board the vessel leaving the site where he has lived with the natives, he cannot bear separation from the tribe, who welcomed and loved him for so long. So he jumps off the ship leaving for Europe and swims to his beloved people.

There are 2 open reading frames (ORF) present in the genome. ORF1 encodes the non-structural protein (NS1) and ORF2 encodes the viral capsid proteins (VP1/VP2). Inverted terminal repeats are present at the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the genome. Within this family there is a third ORF lying within VP1. The NS1 protein possesses both helicase and ATPase domains. It has ~652 amino acids residues and a molecular weight of 70‚Äì75 kiloDaltons (kDa). The VP1 protein contains 900‚Äì950 amino acid residues and is ~100 kDa in molecular weight. VP1 has a conserved phospholipase A2 domain which is used by the virion to escape from the endosome. The third ORF encodes a small protein with a single transmembrane helix spanning 20 amino acid residues in the centre. Its molecular weight is ~10 kDa. The function of this protein is not known. Virology These viruses have been isolated from blood, liver, spleen, lymph node and bone marrow. Clinical These viruses have not been associated with disease in any of their known hosts to date.

Background The establishment of Charlestown Female Seminary was part of a movement to facilitate the education of young women that took root in the United States in the 1820s and 1830s. The movement started in 1814 with the establishment by Catherine Fiske, in Keene, New Hampshire, of the \\"Young Ladies Seminary.\\"Emma Hart Willard opened the Middlebury Female Seminary in her home in Middlebury, Vermont the same year. Another important early school was Emma Willard Troy Female Seminary, opened in 1821 in Troy, New York. Charlestown became the site of a pair of what amateur historian Charles Zellner, of the Charlestown Historical Society, called the \\"earliest boarding schools\\" for young women. The first of these was the Mount Benedict Academy, a combined Roman Catholic convent and finishing school for young ladies, established in 1828 by Benedict Fenwick, Roman Catholic bishop of Boston. That academy was staffed by Ursuline nuns. Mount Benedict acquired a superior reputation, leading both Catholic and Protestant families to enroll their daughters there. Despite that acceptance, in 1834 the Academy was burned by an anti-Catholic mob. History The Charlestown Female Seminary, located at 30 Union Street, was established by two First Baptist Church pastors, Dr. William Collier and Dr. Henry Jackson. They opened the school in 1830, but in 1831 it was taken over by Martha Whiting, \\"one of the pioneers of female education in America,\\" on the suggestion of her pastor, Rev. Jackson. Eventually, Seminary Street was named after the school. Distinguished alumnae Sophia B. Packard, American educator, co-founder in Atlanta, Georgia of the predecessor to Spelman College, a school for African American women, graduated from this school in 1850. Author Mary Hayden Pike matriculated in 1843. Louise Amelia Knapp Smith Clappe (July 28, 1819 ‚Äì February 9, 1906) was an early California settler, having sailed there in 1849 with her husband, Dr. Fayette Clapp. She taught for 24 years in the San Francisco Public Schools, from 1854 and retired in 1878. In 1838, Louise Clapp attended the female seminary in Charleston. She was a United States traveler and author and a scientific writer on mining. Painter Ellen Harrington created paintings including a Portfolio of Exercises and Drawings Done while a student at the academy. They are in the possession of the Shelburne Museum, Shelburne, Vermont 05482. The Parke-Bernet auction catalog states the works are \\"paintings and drawings [by her] ... as a pupil prior to August 1848; comprising her diploma, two sketchbooks, and six paintings, the latter appearing on the front and back cover of three composition books.

First released in 2011, it became the world's largest standalone mobile app in 2018,It's time for messaging apps to quit the bullshit numbers and tell us how many users are active . techinasia.com. 23 January 2014. Steven Millward. with over 1 billion monthly active users. WeChat has been described as China's \\"app for everything\\" and a \\"super app\\" because of its wide range of functions. WeChat provides text messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast (one-to-many) messaging, video conferencing, video games, sharing of photographs and videos, and location sharing. User activity on WeChat is analyzed, tracked and shared with Chinese authorities upon request as part of the mass surveillance network in China. WeChat censors politically sensitive topics in China. Data transmitted by accounts registered outside of China is surveilled, analyzed and used to build up censorship algorithms in China. In response to a border dispute between India and China, WeChat was banned in India in June 2020 along with all apps made in China. U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ban U.S. \\"transactions\\" with WeChat through an executive order but was blocked by a preliminary injunction issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in September 2020. History WeChat began as a project at Tencent Guangzhou Research and Project center in October 2010. The original version of the app was created by Allen Zhang and named \\"Weixin\\" () by Ma Huateng, CEO of Tencent and launched in 2011. The government has actively supported the development of the e-commerce market in China‚Äîfor example in the 12th five-year plan (2011‚Äì2015). By 2012, when the number of users reached 100 million, Weixin was re-branded \\"WeChat\\" for the international market. WeChat had over 889 million monthly active users in 2016. As of 2019, WeChat's monthly active users have increased to an estimate of one billion. After the launch of WeChat payment in 2013, its users reached 400 million the next year, 90 percent of whom were in China. By comparison, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp had about one billion monthly active users in 2016 but did not offer most of the other services available on WeChat. For example, in Q2 2017, WeChat's revenues from social media advertising were about US$0.9 billion (RMB6 billion) compared to Facebook's total revenues of US$9.3 billion, 98% of which were from social media advertising. WeChat's revenues from its value-added services were US$5.5 billion. According to SimilarWeb, WeChat was the most popular messaging app in China and Bhutan in 2016. Features Messaging WeChat provides text messaging, hold-to- talk voice messaging, broadcast (one-to-many) messaging, video calls and conferencing, video games, photograph and video sharing, as well as location sharing. Published on 9 August 2016 WeChat also allows users to exchange contacts with people nearby via Bluetooth, as well as providing various features for contacting people at random if desired (if people are open to it). It can also integrate with other social networking services such as Facebook and Tencent QQ. Photographs may also be embellished with filters and captions, and automatic translation service is available. WeChat supports different instant messaging methods, including text message, voice message, walkie talkie, and stickers. Users can send previously saved or live pictures and videos, profiles of other users, coupons, lucky money packages, or current GPS locations with friends either individually or in a group chat. WeChat's character stickers, such as Tuzki, resemble and compete with those of LINE, a Japanese-South Korean messaging application. Public accounts WeChat users can register as a public account (), which enables them to push feeds to subscribers, interact with subscribers and provide them with services. Users can also create an official account, which fall under service, subscription, or enterprise accounts. Once users as individuals or organizations set up a type of account, they cannot change it to another type. By the end of 2014, the number of WeChat official accounts had reached 8 million. Official accounts of organizations can apply to be verified (cost 300 RMB or about US$45). Official accounts can be used as a platform for services such as hospital pre-registrations, visa renewal or credit card service. To create an official account, the applicant must register with Chinese authorities, which discourages \\"foreign companies\\". Moments \\"Moments\\" () is WeChat's brand name for its social feed of friends' updates. \\"Moments\\" is an interactive platform that allows users to post images, text, and short videos taken by users. It also allows users to share articles and music (associated with QQ Music or other web-based music services). Friends in the contact list can give thumbs up to the content and leave comments. Moments can be linked to Facebook and Twitter accounts, and can automatically post Moments content directly on these two platforms. In 2017 WeChat had a policy of a maximum of two advertisements per day per Moments user. Privacy in WeChat works by groups of friends: only the friends from the user's contact are able to view their Moments' contents and comments. The friends of the user will only be able to see the likes and comments from other users only if they are in a mutual friend group. For example, friends from high school are not able to see the comments and likes from friends from a university. When users post their moments, they can separate their friends into a few groups, and they can decide whether this Moment can be seen by particular groups of people. Contents posted can be set to \\"Private\\", and then only the user can view it. WeChat Pay digital payment services WeChat Pay Users who have provided bank account information may use the app to pay bills, order goods and services, transfer money to other users, and pay in stores if the stores have a WeChat payment option. Vetted third parties, known as \\"official accounts\\", offer these services by developing lightweight \\"apps within the app\\". Users can link their Chinese bank accounts, as well as Visa, MasterCard and JCB. WeChat Pay () is a digital wallet service incorporated into WeChat, which allows users to perform mobile payments and send money between contacts. Although users receive immediate notification of the transaction, the WeChat Pay system is not an instant payment instrument, because the funds transfer between counterparts is not immediate. The settlement time depends on the payment method chosen by the customer. All WeChat users have their own WeChat Payment accounts. Users can acquire a balance by linking their WeChat account to their debit cards, or by receiving money from other users. For non-Chinese users of WeChat Pay, an additional identity verification process of providing a photo of a valid ID as well as oneself is required before certain functions of WeChat Pay become available. Users who link their credit card can only make payments to vendors, and cannot use this to top up WeChat balances. WeChat Pay can be used for digital payments, as well as payments from participating vendors. As of March 2016, WeChat Pay had over 300 million users. In 2014, for Chinese New Year, WeChat introduced a feature for distributing virtual red envelopes, modelled after the Chinese tradition of exchanging packets of money among friends and family members during holidays. The feature allows users to send money to contacts and groups as gifts. When sent to groups, the money is distributed equally, or in random shares (\\"Lucky Money\\"). The feature was launched through a promotion during China Central Television (CCTV)'s heavily watched New Year's Gala, where viewers were instructed to shake their phones during the broadcast for a chance to win sponsored cash prizes from red envelopes. The red envelope feature significantly increased the adoption of WeChat Pay. According to the Wall Street Journal, 16 million red envelopes were sent in the first 24 hours of this new feature's launch. A month after its launch, WeChat Pay's user base expanded from 30 million to 100 million users, and 20 million red envelopes were distributed during the New Year holiday. In 2016, 3.2 billion red envelopes were sent over the holiday period, and 409,000 alone were sent at midnight on Chinese New Year. In 2016, WeChat started a service charge if users transferred cash from their WeChat wallet to their debit cards. On 1 March, WeChat payment stopped collecting fees for the transfer function. Starting from the same day, fees will be charged for withdrawals. Each user had a 1,000 Yuan (about US$150) free withdrawal limit. Further withdrawals of more than 1,000 Yuan were charged a 0.1 percent fee with a minimum of 0.1 Yuan per withdrawal. Other payment functions including red envelopes and transfers were still free. WeChat Pay's main competitor in China and the market leader in online payments is Alibaba Group's Alipay. Alibaba company founder Jack Ma considered the red envelope feature to be a \\"Pearl Harbor moment\\", as it began to erode Alipay's historic dominance in the online payments industry in China, especially in peer-to-peer money transfer. The success prompted Alibaba to launch its own version of virtual red envelopes in its competing Laiwang service. Other competitors, Baidu Wallet and Sina Weibo, also launched similar features. In 2019 it was reported that WeChat had overtaken Alibaba with 800 million active WeChat mobile payment users versus 520 million for Alibaba's Alipay. However Alibaba had a 54 per cent share of the Chinese mobile online payments market in 2017 compared to WeChat's 37 per cent share. In the same year, Tencent introduced \\"WeChat Pay HK\\", a payment service for users in Hong Kong. Transactions are carried out with the Hong Kong dollar. In 2019 it was reported that Chinese users can use WeChat Pay in 25 countries outside of China, including, Italy, South Africa and the UK. In the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Charlie Munger identified WeChat as one of the few potential competitors to Visa, Mastercard and American Express. Enterprise WeChat For work purposes, companies and business communication, a special version of WeChat called Enterprise WeChat (or Qiye Weixin) was launched in 2016. The app was meant to help employees separate work from private life. In addition to the usual chat features, the program let companies and their employees keep track of annual leave days and expenses that need to be reimbursed, employees could ask for time off or clock in to show they were at work. WeChat Mini Program In 2017, WeChat launched a feature called \\"Mini Programs\\" (). A mini program is an app within an app. Business owners can create mini apps in the WeChat system, implemented using JavaScript plus a proprietary API. Users may install these inside the WeChat app. In January 2018, WeChat announced a record of 580,000 mini programs. With one Mini Program, consumers could scan the Quick Response code using their mobile phone at a supermarket counter and pay the bill through the user's WeChat mobile wallet. WeChat Games have received huge popularity, with its \\"Jump Jump\\" game attracting 400 million players in less than 3 days and attaining 100 million daily active users in just two weeks after its launch, as of January 2018. Mini Programs also allow businesses to sell products and services on WeChat directly to consumers, using WeChat Pay as the payment gateway. Other WeChat is colloquially called as \\"wx\\" or \\"vx\\", the initials of \\"Weixin\\". In 2015, WeChat offered a heat map feature that showed crowd density. Quartz columnist Josh Horwitz alleged the feature is being used by the Chinese government to track irregular assemblies of people to determine unlawful assembly. In January 2016, Tencent launched WeChat Out, a VOIP service allowing users to call mobile phones and landlines around the world. The feature allowed purchasing credit within the app using a credit card. WeChat Out was originally only available in the United States, India, and Hong Kong, but later coverage was expanded to Thailand, Macau, Laos, and Italy. In March 2017, Tencent released WeChat Index. By inserting a search term in the WeChat Index page, users could check the popularity of this term in the past 7, 30, or 90 days. The data was mined from data in official WeChat accounts and metrics such as social sharing, likes and reads were used in the evaluation. In May 2017, Tencent started news feed and search functions for its WeChat app. The Financial Times reported this was a \\"direct challenge to Chinese search engine Baidu\\". WeChat allowed people to add friends by a variety of methods, including searching by username or phone number, adding from phone or email contacts, playing a \\"message in a bottle\\" game, or viewing nearby people who are also using the same service. In 2015 WeChat added a \\"friend radar\\" function. In 2017, WeChat was reported to be developing an augmented reality (AR) platform as part of its service offering. Its artificial intelligence team was working on a 3D rendering engine to create a realistic appearance of detailed objects in smartphone- based AR apps. They were also developing a simultaneous localization and mapping technology, which would help calculate the position of virtual objects relative to their environment, enabling AR interactions without the need for markers, such as Quick Response codes or special images. In late 2019, WeChat released dark theme for Android users. It was released later in early 2020 for iOS amidst rumors that WeChat would be removed from the Apple store if they do not release dark theme. In spring 2020, WeChat users are now able to change their WeChat ID more than once, being allowed to change their username only once per year. Prior to this, a WeChat ID could not be changed more than once. On 17 June 2020, WeChat released a new add-on called \\"WeChat Nudge\\". The feature was first introduced in MSN Messenger 7.0, in 2005. The feature was called Buzz in Yahoo! Messenger and the feature had interoperability with MSN Messenger's Nudge. Similar to Messenger and Yahoo, users can access WeChat Nudge by double-clicking on other users' profiles in the chat. This virtually shakes user's profile photo and sends a vibration notification. Both users must have the latest wechat update(7.0.13). If a user does not have the latest update they can't nudge another user but can still receive nudges.A user can only nudge another user if they have previous conversations. Newly added friends without previous messages cannot nudge each other. WeChat Business WeChat Business () is one of the latest mobile social network business model after e-commerce, which utilizes business relationships and friendships to maintain a customer relationship. Comparing with the traditional E-business like JD.com and Alibaba, WeChat Business has a large range of influence and profits with less input and lower threshold, which attracts loads of people to join in WeChat business. Marketing modes B2C Mode This is the main profit mode of WeChat Business. The first one is to launch advertisements and provide service through WeChat Official Account, which is a B2C mode. This mode has been used by many hospitals, banks, fashion brands, internet companies and personal blogs because the Official Account can access to online payment, location sharing, voice messages, mini-games and so on. It is like a 'mini app', so the company has to hire specific staff to manage the account. By 2015, there are more than 100 million WeChat Official Accounts in this platform. B2B Mode WeChat salesperson in this mode is to agent and promote products by individual, which belongs to C2C mode. In this mode, individual sellers always post relevant photos and messages of their agent products on the WeChat Moments or WeChat groups and sell products to their WeChat friends. Besides, they develop a friendship with their customers by sending messages in festivals or write comments under their updates on WeChat moments to increase their trust. Also, continuing to communicate with the regular customers raises the 'WOF' (word-of-mouth) communications, which influences decision-making. Some of the WeChat businessman already have an online shop in Taobao, but use WeChat to maintain existing customers. Existing problems As more and more people have joined WeChat Business, it has brought many problems. For example, some sellers have begun to sell fake luxury goods such as bags, clothes and watches. Some of them have special channels to obtain high-quality fake luxury products and sell them at a low price. Moreover, some sellers have even disguised themselves as international flight attendants or overseas students to post fake stylish photos on WeChat Moments. They then claim that they can provide overseas purchasing services but sell fake luxury goods at the same price as the true one. Another hot product selling on WeChat is facial masks. Its marketing mode is like that of Amway but most goods are unbranded products which came from illegal factories making excess hormones which could have serious effects on a customer's health. However, it is difficult for customers to defend their rights because a large number of sellers' identities are uncertified. Additionally, the lack of any supervision mechanism in WeChat business also provides chances for criminals to continue this illegal behavior. Marketing Campaigns In a 2016 campaign, users could upload a paid photo on \\"Moments\\" and other users who could pay to see the photo and comment on it. The photos were taken down each night. Collaborations In 2014, Burberry partnered with WeChat to create its own WeChat apps around its fall 2014 runway show, giving users live streams from the shows. Another brand, Michael Kors used WeChat to give live updates from their runway show, and later to run a photo contest \\"Chic Together WeChat campaign\\". In 2016, L'Or√©al China cooperated with Papi Jiang to promote their products. Over one million people watched her first video promoting L'Oreal's beauty brand MG. In 2016, WeChat partnered with 60 Italian companies (WeChat had an office in Milan) who were able to sell their products and services on the Chinese market without having to get a license to operate a business in China. In 2017, Andrea Ghizzoni, European director of Tencent, said that 95 percent of global luxury brands used WeChat. Platforms Currently, WeChat's mobile phone app is available only for Android and iOS. BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Symbian phones were supported before. However, as of 22 September 2017, WeChat is no longer working on Windows Phones. The company ceased the development of the app for Windows Phones before the end of 2017. Although Web-based OS X and Windows clients exist, this requires the user to have the app installed on a supported mobile phone for authentication, and neither message roaming nor 'Moments' are provided. Thus, without the app on a supported phone, it is not possible to use the web-based WeChat clients on the computer. The company also provides WeChat for Web, a web-based client with messaging and file transfer capabilities. Other functions cannot be used on it, such as the detection of nearby people, or interacting with Moments or Official Accounts. To use the Web-based client, it is necessary to first scan a QR code using the phone app. This means it is not possible to access the WeChat network if a user does not possess a suitable smartphone with the app installed. WeChat could be accessed on Windows using BlueStacks until December 2014. Beginning then, WeChat blocks Android emulators and accounts that have signed in from emulators may be frozen. There have been some reported issues with the Web client. Specifically when using English, some users have experienced autocorrect, autocomplete, auto-capitalization, and auto-delete behavior as they type messages and even after the message was sent. For example, \\"gonna\\" was autocorrected to \\"go\\", the E's were auto-deleted in \\"need\\", \\"wechat\\" was auto-capitalized to \\"Wechat\\" but not \\"WeChat\\", and after the message was sent, \\"don't\\" got auto-corrected to \\"do not\\". However, the auto-corrected word(s) after the message was sent appeared on the phone app as the user had originally typed it (\\"don't\\" was seen on the phone app whereas \\"do not\\" was seen on the Web client). Users could translate a foreign language during a conversation and the words were posted on Moments. WeChat opens up video calls for multiple people not only to one person call. Controversies State surveillance and intelligence gathering WeChat operates from China under Chinese law, which includes strong censorship provisions and interception protocols. WeChat can access and expose the text messages, contact books, and location histories of its users. Due to WeChat's popularity, the Chinese government uses WeChat as a data source to conduct mass surveillance in China. States/Regions such as India, Australia the United States, and Taiwan fear that the app poses a threat to national or regional security for various reasons. In June 2013, the Indian Intelligence Bureau flagged WeChat for security concerns. India has debated whether or not they should ban WeChat for its possibility in collecting too much personal information and data from its users. In Taiwan, legislators were concerned that the potential exposure of private communications was a threat to regional security. In 2016, Tencent was awarded a score of zero out of 100 in an Amnesty International report ranking technology companies on the way they implement encryption to protect the human rights of their users. The report placed Tencent last out of a total of 11 companies, including Facebook, Apple, and Google, for the lack of privacy protections built into WeChat and QQ. The report found that Tencent did not make use of end-to-end encryption, which is a system that allows only the communicating users to read the messages. It also found that Tencent did not recognize online threats to human rights, did not disclose government requests for data, and did not publish specific data about its use of encryption. A September 2017 update to the platform's privacy policy detailed that log data collected by WeChat included search terms, profiles visited, and content that had been viewed within the app. Additionally, metadata related to the communications between WeChat users‚Äîincluding call times, duration, and location information‚Äîwas also collected. This information, which was used by Tencent for targeted advertising and marketing purposes, might be disclosed to representatives of the Chinese government: # To comply with an applicable law or regulations. # To comply with a court order, subpoena, or other legal process. # In response to a request by a government authority, law enforcement agency, or similar body. In May 2020, Citizen Lab published a study that claimed that WeChat monitors foreign chats to hone its censorship algorithms. On August 14, 2020, Radio Free Asia reported that in 2019, Gao Zhigang, a citizen of Taiyuan city, Shanxi Province, China, used WeChat to forward a video to Geng Guanjun, who is Gao's friend in the United States, and then Gao was convicted on the charge of the crime ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking troubles‚Äù, and sentenced to a ten- months' imprisonment. The Court documents show that China's network management and propaganda departments directly monitor WeChat users, and the Chinese police use big data facial technology to identify Geng Guanjun as an overseas democracy activist. In September 2020, Chevron Corporation mandated that its employees delete WeChat from company-issued phones. Privacy issues Users inside and outside of China also have expressed concern for the privacy issues of the app. Human rights activist Hu Jia was jailed for three years for sedition. He speculated that the officials of the Internal Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security listened to his voicemail messages that were directed to his friends, repeating the words displayed within the voice mail messages to Hu Jia. Chinese authorities have further accused the WeChat app of threatening individual safety. China Central Television (CCTV), a state-run broadcaster, featured a piece in which WeChat was described as an app that helped criminals due to its location-reporting features. CCTV gave an example of such accusations through reporting the murder of a single woman who, after he attempted to rob her, was murdered by a man she met on WeChat. The location-reporting feature, according to reports, was the reason for the man knowing the victim's whereabouts. Authorities within China have linked WeChat to numerous crimes. The city of Hangzhou, for example, reported over twenty crimes related to WeChat in the span of three months. XcodeGhost malware In 2015, Apple published a list of the top 25 most popular apps infected with the XcodeGhost malware, confirming earlier reports that version 6.2.5 of WeChat for iOS was infected with it. The malware originated in a counterfeit version of Xcode (dubbed \\"XcodeGhost\\"), Apple's software development tools, and made its way into the compiled app through a modified framework. Despite Apple's review process, WeChat and other infected apps were approved and distributed through the App Store. Even though some sources claimed that the malware was capable of prompting the user for their account credentials, opening URLs and reading the device's clipboard, Apple responded that the malware was not capable of doing \\"anything malicious\\" or transmitting any personally identifiable information beyond \\"apps and general system information\\" and that it had no information that suggested that this had happened. Some commentators considered this to be the largest security breach in the App Store's history. Current ban in India In June 2020, the Government of India banned WeChat along with 58 other Chinese apps citing data and privacy issues, in response to a border clash between India and China earlier in the year. The banned Chinese apps were \\"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users‚Äô data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India,\\" and was \\"hostile to national security and defense of India\\", claimed India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Previous ban in Russia On 6 May 2017, Russia has blocked access to WeChat for failing to give its contact details to the Russian communications watchdog. The ban was swiftly lifted on 11 May 2017 after Tencent provided \\"relevant information\\" for registration to the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor). Ban and injunction against ban in the United States On August 6, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, seeking to ban WeChat in the U.S. in 45 days, due to its connections with the Chinese- owned Tencent. This was signed alongside a similar executive order targeting TikTok and its Chinese-owned ByteDance. The Department of Commerce issued orders on September 18, 2020 to enact the ban on WeChat and TikTok by the end of September 20, 2020, citing national security and data privacy concerns. The measures will ban the transferring of funds or processing through WeChat in the U.S. and bar any company from offering hosting, content delivery networks or internet transit to WeChat. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Department of Commerce order on both TikTok and WeChat on September 20, 2020 based on respective lawsuits filed by Tiktok and US WeChat Users Alliance, citing the merits of the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. The Justice Department had previously asked Beeler to not block the order to ban the apps saying it would undermine the presidents ability to deal with threats to national security. In her ruling, Beeler said that while the government had established that China‚Äôs activities raised significant national security concerns, it showed little evidence that the WeChat ban would address those nat-sec concerns. Censorship Global censorship Starting in 2013, reports arose that Chinese-language searches even outside China were being keyword filtered and then blocked. This occurred on incoming traffic to China from foreign countries but also exclusively between foreign parties (the service had already censored its communications within China). In the international example of blocking, a message was displayed on users' screens: \\"The message \\"\\" your message contains restricted words. Please check it again.\\" These are the Chinese characters for a Guangzhou-based paper called Southern Weekly (or, alternatively, Southern Weekend). The next day Tencent released a statement addressing the issue saying \\"A small number of WeChat international users were not able to send certain messages due to a technical glitch this Thursday. Immediate actions have been taken to rectify it. We apologize for any inconvenience it has caused to our users. We will continue to improve the product features and technological support to provide a better user experience.\\" WeChat planned to build two different platforms to avoid this problem in the future; one for the Chinese mainland and one for the rest of the world. The problem existed because WeChat's servers were all located in China and thus subjected to its censorship rules. Following the overwhelming victory of pro-democracy candidates in the 2019 Hong Kong local elections WeChat censored messages related to the election and disabled the accounts of posters in other countries such as U.S. and Canada. Many of those targeted were of Chinese ancestry. In 2020, WeChat started censoring messages concerning the coronavirus. Two censorship systems In 2016, the Citizen Lab published a report saying that WeChat was using different censorship policies in mainland China and other areas. They found that: # Keyword filtering was only enabled for users who registered via phone numbers from mainland China; # Users did not get notices anymore when messages are blocked; # Filtering was more strict on group chat; # Keywords were not static. Some newfound censored keywords were in response to current news events; # The Internal browser in WeChat blocked Chinese accounts from accessing some websites such as gambling, Falun Gong and critical reports on China. International users were not blocked except for accessing some gambling and pornography websites. Restricting sharing websites in \\"Moments\\" In 2014, WeChat announced that according to \\"related regulations\\", domains of the web pages that want to get shared in WeChat Moments need to get an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license by 31 December 2014 to avoid being restricted by WeChat. Censorship in Iran In September 2013, WeChat was blocked in Iran. The Iranian authorities cited WeChat Nearby (Friend Radar) and the spread of pornographic content as the reason of censorship. The Committee for Determining Instances of Criminal Content (a working group under the supervision of the attorney general) website FAQ says: > Because WeChat collects phone data and monitors member activity and because > app developers are outside of the country and not cooperating, this software > has been blocked, so you can use domestic applications for cheap voice > calls, video calls and messaging. On 4 January 2018, WeChat was unblocked in Iran.

He was a notable horologist who succeeded David Ramsay. Edward East, trained as a goldsmith, was a founding member of the London Clockmakers Company in 1631.  Biography  East was apprenticed in 1618 to Richard Rogers in the Goldsmiths' Company. He was one of the ten original assistants named in the charter of incorporation of the Clockmakers' Company, and at once took a leading part in its proceedings, and after serving in the subordinate capacities was elected master in 1645, a post he again occupied in 1652. He was the only treasurer ever appointed, and the creation of the office came about in a curious way. In 1647, the renter warden, Mr. Helden, refused to give the usual security for the stock of the company, and in this dilemma the office of treasurer was created, Mr. East and Mr. Hackett being nominated thereto, and the former chosen. On the death of Mr. East the office was allowed to lapse. He at one time resided in Pall Mall, near the tennis court, and attended the king when tennis and other games were being played in the Mall, his Majesty often providing one of East's watches as a prize. Edward East seems to have removed to Fleet Street, for it is related that at a later period the king's attendant, Mr. Herbert, failing in the punctual discharge of his duties in the morning, his Majesty provided him with a gold alarum watch, which was fetched from the king's watchmaker, Mr. East, in Fleet Street. He was in Fleet Street in 1635, for a correspondent of Notes and Queries had in 1900 a MS. Return of Strangers within the ward of Farringdon Without wherein East is referred to as of Fleet Street, in the parish of St. Dunstan's in the West, and as the employer of one Elias Dupree, a Dutchman. The locality of a presumably still later residence is indicated by a reference to \\" Mr. East at the Sun, outside Temple Bar,\\" in the London Gazette, 22‚Äì26 January 1690. Edward East lived to a good age. There is no record of his death but his will was proved (its validity established) in February 1697.  Clocks and watches  Winged lantern clock made by Edward East in the late 17th century just after the invention of the pendulum clock in 1657 A large silver alarum clock- watch by Edward East, which was kept at the bedside of Charles I, was presented by the king on his way to execution at Whitehall, on 30 January 1649, to Sir Thomas Herbert. Among the collections of Alfred Morrison was a warrant, dated 23 June 1649, from the Committee of Public Revenue to Thomas Fauconbridge, Esq., Receiver-General, authorizing him to pay \\"vnto Mr. Edward East, Watchmaker, the some of fortie pounds for a Watch and a Larum of gould by him made for the late King Charles by directions of the Earle of Pembrooke, by order of the Committee, and deliuered for the late King's use the xviith of January last.\\" In the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford is a watch by East with gold case in the form of a melon, studded all over with turquoises, the pendant being enamelled blue to match. Two other undoubted specimens of this master's work are in the Clockmakers' Museum. In the British Museum is a watch by East with a tortoiseshell case, dating from about 1640. The Victoria & Albert Museum also possesses a specimen of his work. Mr. George Carr Glyn exhibited at the Guelph Exhibition a clock-watch by him in silver pierced cases. Among the Wetherfield collection were four long-case clocks and one bracket clock by East.

It is one of the most famous symbols of Vukovar and the suffering of the city and the country in the Battle of Vukovar and the Croatian War of Independence, when the water tower and the city itself were largely destroyed by the Serbian forces. History The water tower was designed by the company Plan and built by Hidrotehna Zagreb, in the late 1960s. It was built in a city park, popularly known as Najpar-ba≈°ƒáa, in the district of Mitnica. Until the war, the top of the tower was home to a restaurant with a view over Vukovar, Dunav and surrounding vineyards. During the Battle of Vukovar, the water tower was one of the most frequent targets of artillery. It was hit more than 600 times during the siege. Today, it converted into a museum with a restaurant while the traces of the war will remain. Future After the reintegration of Vukovar into the Republic of Croatia, reconstruction of the water tower was initiated by Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman, but that has since changed.

In DAS, the optical fiber cable becomes the sensing element and measurements are made, and in part processed, using an attached optoelectronic device. Such a system allows acoustic frequency strain signals to be detected over large distances and in harsh environments. Fundamentals of Rayleigh scatter based fiber optic sensing In Rayleigh scatter based distributed fiber optic sensing, a coherent laser pulse is sent along an optic fiber, and scattering sites within the fiber cause the fiber to act as a distributed interferometer with a gauge length approximately equal to the pulse length. The intensity of the reflected light is measured as a function of time after transmission of the laser pulse. This is known as Coherent Rayleigh Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (COTDR). When the pulse has had time to travel the full length of the fiber and back, the next laser pulse can be sent along the fiber. Changes in the reflected intensity of successive pulses from the same region of fiber are caused by changes in the optical path length of that section of fiber. This type of system is very sensitive to both strain and temperature variations of the fiber and measurements can be made almost simultaneously at all sections of the fiber. Capabilities of Rayleigh-based systems Maximum range The optical pulse is attenuated as it propagates along the fiber. For a single mode fiber operating at 1550 nm, a typical attenuation is 0.2 dB/km. Since the light must make a double pass along each section of fiber, this means each 1 km causes a total loss of 0.4 dB. The maximum range of the system occurs when the amplitude of the reflected pulse becomes so low it is impossible to obtain a clear signal from it. It is not possible to counteract this effect by increasing the input power because above a certain level this will induce nonlinear optical effects which will disrupt the operation of the system. Typically the maximum range that can be measured is around 40‚Äì50 km. Strain resolution The maximum value of strain that can be measured depends on the carrier to noise ratio of the returning optical signal. The carrier level is largely determined by the amplitude of the optical signal while the noise is a combination of that from a variety of sources including laser noise, electronic noise and detector noise. Spatial resolution and spatial sampling period The spatial resolution is mainly determined by the duration of the transmitted pulse, with a 100 ns pulse giving 10 m resolution being a typical value. The amount of reflected light is proportional to the pulse length so there is a trade-off between spatial resolution and maximum range. To improve the maximum range, it would be desirable to use a longer pulse length to increase the reflected light level but this leads to a larger spatial resolution. In order for two signals to be independent, they must be obtained from two points on the fiber that are separated by at least the spatial resolution. It is possible to obtain samples at separations less than the spatial resolution and although this produces signals that are not independent of each other, such an approach does offer advantages in some applications. The separation between the sampling points is sometimes referred to as the spatial sampling period. Acquisition rate Before the next laser pulse can be transmitted the previous one must have had time to travel to the far end of the fiber and for the reflections from there to return, otherwise reflections would be returning from different sections of the fiber at the same time and the system would not operate properly. For a fiber 50 km long the maximum pulse rate is just over 2 kHz. Therefore, strains can be measured which vary at frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency of 1 kHz. Shorter fibers clearly enable higher acquisition rates. Temperature measurements Although the system is sensitive to both temperature and strain variations these can often be separated as those due to temperature tend to occur at a lower frequency range than strain. Unlike other distributed fiber techniques such as those based on Brillouin or Raman scatter, distributed acoustic sensing is only able to detect changes in temperature rather than its absolute value. Comparison with other fiber optic distributed sensing techniques Distributed acoustic sensing relies on light which is Rayleigh backscattered from small variations in the refractive index of the fiber. The backscattered light has the same frequency as the transmitted light. There are a number of other distributed fiber sensing techniques that rely on different scattering mechanisms and can be used to measure other parameters. Brillouin scatter occurs due to the interaction between the light and acoustic phonons travelling in the fiber. As the light is scattered by a moving phonon, its frequency is shifted by the Doppler effect by around 10 GHz. Light is generated at both above (anti-Stokes shift) and below (Stokes shift) the original optical frequency. The intensity and frequency shifts of the two components are dependent on both temperature and strain and by measuring the shifts, absolute values of the two parameters can be calculated using a distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system. Brillouin scatter is much weaker than Rayleigh scatter and so the reflections from a number of pulses must be summed together to enable the measurements to be made. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which changes can be measured using Brillouin scatter is typically a few tens of Hz. Raman scatter occurs when light is scattered in interaction with molecular vibrations in the fiber. As with Brillouin scattering, both Stokes and anti- Stokes components are produced and these are shifted from the wavelength of the incident light by several tens of nanometers. By measuring the ratio in intensity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, an absolute value of temperature can be measured by a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system. The larger wavelength shifts compared to Brillouin scatter mean that it is easier to separate the scattered Raman light from the un-shifted Rayleigh scattered component. However the intensity of the Raman scatter is even lower than the Brillouin scatter and so it is normally necessary to average for many seconds or even minutes in order to get reasonable results. Therefore, Raman- based systems are only suitable for measuring slowly varying temperatures. Phase-sensitive coherent optical time-domain reflectometry Phase- sensitive coherent optical time-domain reflectometry (œï-OTDR) is a technique that can provide sufficient sensitivity and resolution for these distributed acoustic sensing systems. Standard optical time-domain reflectometry techniques use light sources with coherence lengths, which are shorter than pulse lengths. This can yield a sum of backscattered intensities from each scattering center, which allows monitoring splices and breaks in fiber optic cables. On the contrary, in œï-OTDR-based sensors, the coherence length of lasers is longer than their pulse length. An event near the fiber generates an acoustic wave that affects the optical fiber by changing the phases of the backscattering centers. An analysis of such signals can reveal their impact on the sensor and monitor located near fiber objects. Applications The sensitivity and speed of Rayleigh-based sensing allows distributed monitoring of acoustic signals over distances of up to 50 km from each laser source. Typical applications include continuous monitoring of pipelines for unwanted interference and for leaks or flow irregularities; monitoring roads, borders, and other sensitive perimeters for unusual activity; and even oil well monitoring applications where the technology allows the state of the well all along its length to be determined in real-time. The ability of the optic fiber to operate in harsh environments makes the technology especially well suited for scenarios in which typical sensing systems are unusable or impractical due to environmental conditions.Mestayer et al, Field trials of distributed acoustic sensing for geophysical monitoring, SEG Expanded Abstracts 30, 4253 (2011). The long range of the technology also allows its use in seismic sensing. One cable can provide a continuous line of regional seismic activity monitoring, and also detect earthquakes thousands of kilometers away.

Early life He was the son of John Philips (1734‚Äì1824), who founded the cotton spinning firm Philips & Lee. The family had significant community and legal connections; in addition to his cotton business John Philips held public office as Deputy Lieutenant for Cheshire, Justice of the Peace for Lancashire and Cheshire, and Chairman of Magistrates at Stockport. They were also related to the founders of textile manufacturers J. & N. Philips, who operated businesses in the Manchester area‚ÄîJohn Philips (1724‚Äì1803), Nathaniel Philips (1726‚Äì1808) and Thomas Philips (1728‚Äì1811). John Leigh Philips himself became involved in the textile industry. For a time he was in business with his brother Francis, who outlived him, dying in 1850. As a young man Philips frequented the Roscoe Circle in Liverpool‚Äîthe intellectual group around William Roscoe‚Äîmeeting there William Paulet Carey, James Currie and Daniel Daulby. Military service In late 1803 Philips was granted command of the First Regiment of the Manchester and Salford Corps, a volunteer militia which served as part of Britain's Home Guard during the French Revolutionary Wars. His brother Francis was appointed to a subordinate role in the same Corps alongside three of his cousins. The Philips' family's elevated social status encouraged John Leigh Philips to consider himself the natural leader of Manchester's military establishment. He was therefore offended when another militia commander, Joseph Hanson of the Salford and Stockport Independent Rifles, declared himself \\"Lieutenant Colonel Commandant\\" with authority over all local volunteer corps. Hanson's claim rested on his corps being older and larger than others in the district, and formed after letters of encouragement from the Earl of Derby acting as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, and from Britain's Secretary of State Lord Hawkesbury. Philips rejected these arguments and publicly questioned Hanson's loyalty to the Crown. When Hanson refused to concede, a furious Philips challenged him to a duel and the two men met on Kersal Moor on 28 July 1804. At the moment they were about to shoot the duel as broken up by constables from Manchester. Philips and Hanson were arrested, but released after a caution to keep the peace. Undeterred, Philips began a lengthy correspondence with both the Earl of Derby and Lord Hawkesbury, seeking adjudication of the dispute in his favour. Derby replied first, supporting Hanson's claim but refusing to get further involved. After some delay Hawkesbury also replied, and in blunter terms. Hanson's right to the title of Lieutenant Colonel Commandant was upheld and Philips was rebuked for \\"disputing the authority under which the [militia] regulations were made.\\" Philips immediately resigned from the militia, as did all 53 officers of his Regiment. Leaderless, the Regiment itself collapsed and its men were subsumed into other companies. Later life An early adopter of gas lighting, he introduced it in the family business in 1805. Philips was also a good friend of Joseph Wright of Derby. Legacy Philips purchased natural history illustrations produced by John Abbot and other illustrators.. He collected over a number of different areas. After Philips died, his book and art collections were sold. Also for sale was his \\"cabinet of insects\\", in three showcases, which was bought by Thomas Henry Robinson with the natural history collection, for over ¬£5,000. It was acquire by a group who in 1821 set up the Manchester Natural History Society (properly the \\"\\"Manchester Society for the Promotion of Natural History\\"). A meeting was called for 30 June 1821, for the specific purpose of preserving the entomological and ornithological collections of Philips: as well as Robinson, Edward Holme and other members of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society attended. Thirty members joined. A new building for the collection was opened in 1835. That museum later became the Manchester Museum. Family Philips married Caroline Renny, and they had five children. The youngest was Nathaniel George Philips.

The Soviet vision was often not compatible with tribal life, and many changes were enacted upon the native framework. This process is often called \\"Sovietization.\\" It is a type of acculturation using political influence. In the success of such a process, the result is neither total assimilation nor total acculturation. National groups have a political identity and operate inside of the Moscow political structure yet maintain aspects of their culture. In practice however, reactions to such policies garnered a wide spectrum of reactions, with some groups in support and others in opposition. The new Soviet lifestyle made it \\"illegal for individuals to own means of production, exchange and communication.\\" Ending exploitation Several attempts were made to stop foreign exploitation of native industries, in particular the fur trade. In 1917, the fur tax was abolished, and efforts were made to stop price exploitation by private fur traders. Traditionally discriminatory practices, such as forced marriages and the bride price were also eliminated during Soviet re-structuring. Anti-shamanism Russian officials strongly opposed the practice of shamanism and the concept of shamans as religious leaders. Shamans were religious conservatives and responsible for general resistance against Soviet reform (doctors, schools, collectivization). They were also responsible for assisting White supporters who fled after the Russian Civil War, which sparked Soviet anger. The shamans felt a strong need to protect the native way of life: shamanism had long provided a sense of communal solidarity. Such solidarity was now used to unite the community against the Soviets for trying to force change. Indeed, the Soviets were afraid of the shamans, because of the communal influence they wielded. Shamans were able to incite violent resistance, for example the Kazym rebellion. However, anti- religious policies eventually gained some traction, without complete success. In the case of the Khanty people, Marjorie Balzer writes that, \\"The scientific materialism of Soviet officialdom has gained limited acceptance without successfully supplanting Khanty spirituality.\\" Rituals are still performed for religion's sake, though Soviet officials claim that such rituals are completely secular. Soviet replacements of shamanistic practices were not successful, because they were not presented as an acceptable alternative. Secular rituals were not rooted in native traditions: they carried Russian roots and Russian aims, which were often perceived as insincere. Thus, these policies produced an outward accommodation rather than actual change. On the other hand, shamanism in the modern day has experienced a severe decline, as the community has begun to perceive of shamanism as \\"bad.\\" This perception reveals the effect that past policies have finally effected: a fear of the political power of shamans and the turmoil they were able to create. Collectivization Collectivization was the policy to reduce nomadic lifestyles and force development of sedentary occupations. National groups were clustered into collectives, which were composed of a cluster of villages centered around a main outpost. The collective center was built usually on a river inlet to facilitate ease of access. The goal was that the outlying villages would no longer become necessary: native groups would ideally be attracted to the consumer goods of the center and the lifestyle it presented. The 1930s brought the introduction of the culture base, a type of collective center. It was supposed to be a model of the new Soviet life and the comforts one could enjoy as part of that lifestyle. The base had an air strip, state stores, a hospital, party headquarters and even a community center. Russian- style houses served as model for native peoples to emulate. Tribal lands were forcibly \\"donated\\" for the advancement of the Soviet cause. This land was divided into hunting/herding areas, fishing sections and specific slaughtering points, often for reindeer. After being placed in the collective, indigenous peoples were redistributed to manage these areas, with an emphasis on food production to support the increase in urban population. The collective divided members into two types of workers: sovkhoz and kolkhoz. The sovkhoz were members that earned wages, for example reindeer breeders. The kolkhoz were members that shared in the profits, for example fishermen, whose profits oscillated depending on the season. Families were forced to rely on subsistence activities applied in a sedentary format: limited hunting, fishing, occasionally planting gardens. Some families were allowed to own individual stocks of cattle, reindeer and horses. This individual stock ownership allowed for the creation of a secondary economy under the radar of the Soviet system. For example, fishing brigades would make a small profit selling caviar to visitors. Reindeer breeding was allowed, being of substantial use to the Soviets, though it operated under the assumption that it would eventually be phased out. Reindeer breeders were perceived as primitive and uneducated, undesirable for the Soviet structure. Despite mistreatment of the reindeer herds and attempts to phase out the practice, it underwent a revival in the 1970s, as improved veterinary practices and the use of helicopters for transportation facilitated better herd management. The collectives also instituted a policy of mandatory education as an exchange for the continuation of traditional life. Reindeer breeders were allowed to return to a semi-nomadic state in exchange for school-age children to attend 8 years of boarding school in the collective center. Officials hoped that better education might encourage a rejection of traditional values and occupations in favor the more-developed Soviet style. The schools were often very crowded and not in the best condition. In the 1950s and 1960s, a resettlement program forced outlying families to move closer to the collective center, in order to make it easier for school attendance and reduce the burden on the boarding system. However, this move meant that land was no longer available for traditional occupations, forcing indigenous groups to participate in \\"modern\\" jobs. The education system was used to enforce the progression of the Russian language as dominant. Schools would often begin instruction in the language of the local indigenous group and rapidly switch over to Russian. Native languages were sometimes taught as secondary subjects. The 1979 census showed a dramatic increase in the number of people who used Russian as a second language. This was likely the result of the forced education policy but potentially a sign that indigenous groups had decided to work with the system instead of against it. Russian leadership of the collective was usually resented, and a knowledge of the Russian language facilitated involvement in the collective command structure. Industrial development The discovery of oil and gas in Siberia placed the region in an unusual spotlight. Renewed interest in the development of the region did not do much to improve the quality of native life. Oil and gas operations meant the further displacement of native peoples. They lacked the technical skills to participate in the industry: officials had not consistently encouraged it. Instead, trained technicians were imported to Siberia, removing the possibility for native involvement and creating further urban population growth. Oil and gas producers took advantage of Native groups' lack of desire to become involved, to perpetuate more exploitation. Border division Outside the collective structure, the Soviets attempted to institute a larger system of ethnic organization. In the 1920s, the oblast/okrug system was used to divide the Soviet Union into smaller provinces. Inside the larger oblasts were often autonomous okrugs: regions where native groups could freely exist. This however did not adequately solved the widespread division of nomadic peoples, and on July 30, 1930, the oblast system was dissolved. The Soviets rejected the idea of a single national majority with internal minorities, which was seen as a capitalist model. In the next development phase, they tried to create an overarching federal structure with a large number of national territories. This strategy was called ethno-territorial proliferation. A breakdown of the National Soviet System National-territorial units were expanded into smaller and smaller units called national soviets. The structure resembled a pyramid, with the number of units growing until reaching the bottom layer, the individual, with a fixed national identity. Tens of thousands of national borders were drawn and re-drawn, forcing everyone to choose a national identity and a set territory corresponding to that identity. This caused a large amount of ethnic conflict. Minorities wanted national soviets, yet even after this division, often remained the minority in a national soviet belonging to another group. The majority of such a soviet did not look kindly on its minority and often actively tried to expel them, by any means possible. Inside these national soviets, efforts were made to unite the national group and Russians living in the territory. Though active resistance against the Russians was small, both Russians and native groups self- segregated, living in ethnic neighborhoods in the collective center. Russians attempted to isolate themselves just as much the natives, through intermarriage and ethnically-homogenous villages.

It was begun by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM) in 1859 and it remained in operation until it merged with St. Ambrose Academy in 1958 to form Assumption High School. The academy building remains in use as an academic building on the campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic. History Foundation In 1844 the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourges, pastor of St. Anthony's Church in Davenport petitioned Bishop Mathias Loras of Dubuque for Sisters to teach in the parish school and to open a girls' school in the town. Five BVM Sisters arrived the same year and established St. Philomena's Academy in a three-story brick house that was still under construction. Unfortunately, most of the parishioners at St. Anthony's, then Davenport's only parish, were mostly poor Irish immigrants. At the same time membership in the congregation had dropped by half as many settlers stopped in Davenport for only a short time as they headed west to their permanent home. Because of low attendance and little money, the Sisters were forced to close the school in 1847. Father Pelamourges continued to petition the bishop to send Sisters and Brothers to Davenport to open schools. After Pelamourges returned to France to visit his ailing father in 1852, Antoine LeClaire, who was the principle founder of the city of Davenport, and Judge G.C.R. Mitchell petitioned Bishop Loras to send religious to Davenport to staff a school for Catholic children. In 1855 the BVM Sisters returned to Davenport to staff St. Anthony's School. Judge Mitchell and his wife offered the Sisters ten acres of land northwest of Davenport to operate an academy for girls. The following year the offer was accepted and Sister Mary Agnes Hurley, BVM, was given the responsibility for building the new school. A two-story brick building with a one-story chapel wing was built and the Academy of the Immaculate Conception was opened in 1859. The location proved to be its downfall. There were no roads that led to the academy and the Financial Panic of 1857 created financial difficulties. In the first two years only seven students were enrolled in the school. Growth Main Street side of the building The Panic of 1857 provided an opportunity, however, as it created bankruptcies in town and property became available. Father Pelamourges was able to purchase the academy site and the Rev. Terrance Donaghoe, who was the director of the BVM Sisters, was able to purchase the home of banker George Sargent on Brady Street in 1861. After five years it too became too small and Father Donaghoe bought the home of Richard Hill at Eighth and Main Streets. The property would be the academy's home for the rest of its existence. The former property outside of town would in time become the site for Mercy Hospital. The BVM Sister's Davenport community numbered 14 Sisters and Sister Mary Margaret Mann, BVM, one of the original members of the BVM community, was its Superior. The Sisters, who lived at the academy, taught at ICA, St. Anthony's and St. Marguerite's schools. Eventually St. Marguerite's and St. Anthony's provided their own convents. A frame building was added to the Richard Hill residence to house music studios and an auditorium. By the early 1880s, a larger building was needed. Davenport architect Victor Huot was chosen to design the new building, which was situated to the north of the former Hill residence. Previously he had designed St. Joseph's and St. Mary's churches in Davenport. He also designed Ambrose Hall the first building that housed St. Ambrose University. Both Ambrose Hall and the ICA building were designed in the Second Empire style, and they were designed so they could be built in stages over a period of time. The first section of the ICA building was opened in 1884. The first addition was added to the building in 1906 and replaced the frame building. A second addition, which fronts Eighth Street, was added three years later. Merger At first, ICA included primary and secondary education, and it included both boarding and day students. Eventually the primary grades were dropped in favor of the secondary grades. In 1940 there were 256 girls enrolled in the school. In 1955 it was determined that Davenport should have a central Catholic high school and that Immaculate Conception and St. Ambrose academies would merge. When it closed ICA enrolled over 400 students. In the 99 years of its existence over 4,000 girls graduated from the school. The academy building was acquired by Palmer College of Chiropractic whose campus is adjacent to the ICA property. The BVM Sisters continued their tradition of teaching at Assumption. The new high school was co-institutional and the Sisters were responsible for the Girls' Division. Sister Ann Esther, BVM, was the principal of the Division until 1962 when she became an assistant principal. Assumption became co-educational in 1969 and the tradition of educating boys and girls separately ended.

Heavy metals left over in the soil from the mining operations have allowed mosses and lichens to flourish, and today the site is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), noted for its biological characteristics. History The mine was first worked in 1836 as Cornwall Great United Mines, having previously been mined separately as Clanacombe, Stowes and Wheal Prosper mines. The mine was subsequently bought by James Seccombe in 1842 who renamed it Phoenix Mine/Wheal Phoenix in 1844, finally being called Phoenix United Mine when West Phoenix Mine was incorporated. The mine originally extracted copper, the 1850s being the mine's peak production of the metal, with a work force of 130. By the 1860s the copper reserves were diminishing but consultant mining engineer, William West, bought a controlling share in the company and equipped the mine to extract tin in 1864 after samples showed evidence of tin deposits. By 1865 the work force had expanded to 460, continuing to 600 by the 1870s. It used the Liskeard and Caradon Railway to transport the ore away and supply the mine with coal. With the price of tin and copper slumping, the West Phoenix Mine ceased operation in 1898. The final shaft, the Prince of Wales Shaft, was closed in 1914. Geography The SSSI, notified in 1996, is located within the civil parish of Linkinhorne, on the south-eastern edge of Bodmin Moor, north of the town of Liskeard.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston The SSSI also forms part of Phoenix United Mine and Crow's Nest Special Area of Conservation. Wildlife and ecology The habitat of the site is dominated by presence of heavy metals from the mining operations within the soil. This has restricted the growth of vascular plants and has allowed bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) and lichens to flourish. Phoenix United Mine is important for its rare bryophytes. On the site, on the banks of a metal-rich stream, can be found three nationally rare liverwort species that are listed in the Red Data Book of rare and endangered plant species; these being Cephaloziella integerrima, Cephaloziella massalongi and Cephaloziella nicholsonii. The nationally scarce liverwort, Cephaloziella stellulifera is also present within the mine. Two nationally scarce species of moss, Gymnostomum viridulum and Gymnostomum calcareum, are supported on the site. The mine is one of only two sites in the world where Cornish path moss (Ditrichum cornubicum) grows, the other being Crow's Nest. This moss is a pioneer species of bare or sparsely vegetated, mine-waste laden soils. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) use disused mine adits as a winter roosting site, and other bat species feed on the site.

It was originally established as Shreveville in 1831 by Jonathan and Samuel Shreve as a textile village on the Rancocas Creek. It was purchased by Hezekiah Bradley Smith in 1865 and renamed to Smithville. The Smithville post office was established in 1866. The H. B. Smith Machine Company, which produced the American Star Bicycle beginning in 1880, was located there. In 1962, the Smithville Post Office was closed. In 1975, Burlington County purchased the property and created the first park in the county. It is listed on the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places as the Smithville Historic District. Bicycle railroad The Mount Holly and Smithville Bicycle Railway - 1892-1898 In 1892, Arthur Hotchkiss received a patent for a bicycle railroad and contracted with the Smith Machine Company to manufacture it. The initial track ran from Smithville, in a nearly straight line, crossing the Rancocas Creek ten times, and arrived at Pine Street, Mount Holly. It was completed in time for the Mount Holly Fair in September 1892, and the purpose of the railway was supposed to have been enabling employees to commute quickly from Mount Holly to the factory at Smithville. Monthly commuter tickets cost $2.00. The record speed on the railway was 4.5 minutes, and the average trip took 6‚Äì7 minutes. The railway was exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. It only had one track so that it was impossible to pass another rider, and if riders traveling in opposite directions met, one had to pull off onto a siding. By 1897 ridership had declined, and the railway fell into disrepair. Notable people People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Smithville include: * Charles R.

The Hotel Gaillard is a Parisian mansion built between 1878 and 1882 by architect Jules F√©vrier on request of banker Emile Gaillard. It is located Place du G√©n√©ral Catroux, in the 17th district of Paris. The hotel hosted in late 2014 the Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie. Portrait of Emile Gaillard, 1870 The builder Emile Gaillard was the Parisian representative of a provincial family bank, founded in Grenoble by his grandfather Th√©odore Fran√ßois Gaillard in the 18th century. His father, Th√©odore Eug√®ne Gaillard, was the mayor of Grenoble from 1858 to 1865. During his banker career, Emile Gaillard participated in the financing of railway networks, managed the Count of Chambord‚Äôs wealth, and was also Victor Hugo‚Äôs banker. His artistic sensitivity made him one of Chopin‚Äôs best students, who dedicated one of his mazurkas to him. Emile Gaillard was a collector, amateur of Middle Ages and Renaissance art. Pieces of furniture, decorative art objects, tapestries and works of art constituted his collection. This collection becoming impossible to hold in his accommodation of rue Daru, Emile Gaillard decided to have a mansion built on the Plaine Monceau, in the 17th district of Paris. He asked Jules F√©vrier to build this neo-gothic castle for him in 1878. Emile Gaillard died in 1902. After his death, the family bank was sold to Credit Lyonnais. The building The mansion is a pastiche of French Renaissance constructions built in the Loire Valley, which aimed at emphasizing Emile Gaillard‚Äôs art collection.

Emile Gaillard welcomed his guests dressed in a Henri II of France attire.Journal des Batignolles, 1885, quoted by Lucien Maillard in Scope Mag, May 2011, p. 16.

The purchase by Banque de France The building remained empty, until the mansion was sold to the Banque de France in 1919 to become one of its branches.

He was also a member of the Socialist Party (SPS) due to his cultural-political work and position, but in January 1993, he was sent together with many other journalists to a so called compulsory vacation, an euphemistic expression of Milo≈°eviƒá regime, with which they were effectively removed from public life, and their oppositional influence on the society should be prevented by this measure.

In consequence, a faction under the leadership of Mirkoviƒá split off from the SPS with the aim of establishing a Social Democratic Party, seeking to present a reformist political agenda. However, in November 1993, this new party only received 0.2 percent approval in an opinion poll for the parliamentary election and had no chance actually.

The man quickly fled after his shovel struck a shoe with partial remains of a human foot still inside. The following October, Dr. George Stovin, after hearing of the discovery set out with his team to finish the excavation. Dr. Stovin concluded that the woman's body was bent so her head and feet were close to touching. Stovin described the skin of corpse to be strong. With the body, a pair of shoes were found, one of which was damaged by the shovel of its discoverer. The sandals were said to have tawny colour and to be pliable.

CFLZ's studios are located on Ontario Avenue in Niagara Falls, Ontario, while its transmitter is located near Fort Erie. It is also the highest rated Canadian station in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls region, according to Nielsen Audio. History Early years The station was launched on Canada Day (July 1) 1986, at 5:30 p.m. as AM 530 CJFT, playing a Top 40 format. Afternoon drive personality Alan Chonka signed CJFT on the air. It moved to FM in 1991, adopted the CKEY- FM call letters, and flipped to adult standards. (from 1945 to 1991, CKEY was the callsign of an AM radio station in Toronto, which now airs Chinese programming as Fairchild Radio affiliate CHKT.) On August 26, 1994, at noon, the station switched to alternative rock as \\"FM 101 The Planet.\\" By 1996, the station shifted to dance music (similar to CING-FM in nearby Hamilton) while retaining the \\"Planet\\" moniker. It was an affiliate of \\"Pirate Radio\\" with Chris Sheppard. On August 21, 1996, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved CJRN 710 Inc.'s application to increase CKEY-FM transmitter from 8,670 watts to 19,700 watts. The Commission also approved the application to amend the broadcasting licence for CKEY-FM by authorizing the licensee to add a transmitter at St. Catharines, operating on frequency 101.1 MHz (channel 266A) with an effective radiated power of 150 watts with a callsign CKEY-FM-1. The Commission notes that this transmitter has been operating on an experimental basis for some time and is a co-channel, synchronous repeater of CKEY-FM Fort Erie.Decision CRTC 96-440, Increase power for CKEY-FM and addition of a transmitter, CRTC, August 21, 1996 On November 14, 1997, the dance format was dropped in favour of a modern AC format (which later shifted to Hot AC), branded as \\"The River\\". In 2001, a change of ownership of CJRN, CKEY-FM and CFLZ-FM to the Niagara Broadcasting Corporation was approved. The company would now be owned by several members of the Dancy family. On September 6, 2002, at 6 AM, the hot AC format moved to sister station CFLZ-FM, and CKEY adopted a rhythmic top 40 format branded as \\"WiLD 101\\". The station entered into a local marketing agreement with Citadel, who operated the station as part of its Buffalo, New York cluster. That LMA was discontinued when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission threatened to revoke the station's licence. By 2005, the station moved to its current top 40 format, and later on, the station changed its branding to Z101 on April 1, 2007. It was the only \\"Wild\\"-branded station in Canada. On December 19, 2005, the CRTC approved the transfer of ownership and control of CJRN 710 Inc. (CJRN Niagara Falls, CKEY-FM Fort Erie and CKEY-FM-1 St. Catharines) from Niagara Broadcasting Corp. (controlled by David Dancy) to Northguard Capital Corp. (owned and controlled by Andrew Ferri). This approval also covered the transfer to Northguard of 788813 Ontario Inc. (CFLZ-FM Niagara Falls), once it became a wholly owned subsidiary of CJRN 710 Inc. Northguard would then amalgamate both entities to continue the operation of the undertakings under the name, CJRN 710 Inc. 2005-1146-1 (December 19, 2005) The CRTC has continued to express concern with CKEY-FM's programming, calling attention in particular to the station's seeming failure to comply with its licence condition requiring a minimum three hours per week of locally oriented news programming. In its 2007 licence renewal, the station was only granted a two-year licence period. Z-101 CFLZ-FM-era Z101.1 logo CKEY-FM was a reporter to the American rhythmic top 40 panel on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS (and also reported on the Canadian top 40 panel on Nielsen BDS), but in 2005, CKEY-FM moved to the American top 40 panel on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS. The station has continued to lean rhythmic even after shifting to mainstream top 40. Another station, CKBT-FM in Kitchener, Ontario (which debuted as rhythmic top 40 in 2004, only to go top 40 in 2005), retains the rhythmic lean. Just like similar stations CIDC-FM-Toronto and CKHZ-FM-Halifax, the station pronounces it \\"Zee\\" instead of \\"Zed\\". In the case of CFLZ, the station is most likely using the American pronunciation due to the station primarily serving Buffalo at this time (but would later shift its focus to the Niagara Region). In 2010, the Haliburton Broadcasting Group applied to buy CKEY-FM and sister station CFLZ-FM.New radio station owner thrilled with Niagara market Niagara Falls Review, 2010Two Niagara Falls radio stations sold , Niagara Falls Review, 2010CRTC Notice of Consultation 2011-188-3 CRTC, April 13, 2011 The transaction received approval on June 8, 2011. On August 24, 2011, the station dropped the rhythmic lean entirely and adopted a more mainstream playlist. The station also unveiled a new logo, and will continue to report as contemporary hit radio per Mediabase and Nielsen BDS. As of November 2011, CKEY-FM was moved to the Mediabase Canadian contemporary hit radio panel from the U.S. contemporary hit radio panel as it still reports as a Buffalo station, but it must register as a St. Catharines station. In late 2011, the station adopted the CFLZ-FM callsign which had been used by its sister station, now known as CJED-FM. As the station's signal has always targeted the Buffalo market and does not fully cover the Niagara Region, the station applied to the CRTC and received approval to deploy a co-channel repeater (CFLZ-FM-1) that is located in south St. Catharines. On April 23, 2012, Vista Broadcast Group, which owns a number of radio stations in western Canada, announced an agreement to acquire the station and CJED-FM from Haliburton Broadcasting, in cooperation with Westerkirk Capital.\\"Westerkirk Capital Acquires Vista and Haliburton Broadcast Groups\\" . Broadcaster, April 26, 2012. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on October 19, 2012. As a result of ongoing issues with the St. Catharines repeater causing interference, Vista had filed an application with the CRTC to take it off the air and remove it from the licence. 2Day FM Logo as 2Day FM, 2013-2016 On September 20, 2013, at noon, after playing \\"This Is What It Feels Like\\" by Armin van Buuren, CFLZ shifted its brand to the \\"2Day FM\\" brand, simulcasting with sister station CJED-FM. The first song on \\"2Day FM\\" was \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke. In May 2014, the licence for CFLZ-FM's repeater (CFLZ-FM-1 101.1 MHz) in St. Catharines was revoked. Vista says the transmitter was shut down last September.Logo while branded as \\"Juice FM\\" On April 30, 2014, Vista filed an application with the CRTC to amend the station's broadcasting licence. On December 8, 2014, the CRTC denied the application and cited Vista for being in non-compliance with various conditions of the licence including converting the station to a full-time rebroadcasting transmitter for CJED-FM without prior approval by the commission. New conditions were placed upon the licensee. CFLZ-FM was taken off the air shortly thereafter. It was returned to air on December 19, 2014, apparently continuing to simulcast to CJED-FM.

Biography Frank Burty Haviland (or simply Frank Burty or Frank Haviland) was the grandson of Philippe Burty (1830-1890), art collector and critic who coined the term \\"japonisme\\". Philippe's daughter Madeline Burty married Charles Haviland, owner of the porcelain company \\"Haviland and Company\\". His older brother Paul Haviland was a photographer and writer. Frank Burty Haviland was born in Limoges in 1886 (some sources give 1879 as his date of birth, less than eight months before the birth of his brother Paul). He studied music with Ricardo Vi√±es, when he met D√©odat de S√©verac, who introduced him to Manolo Hugu√©. The three became friends, and through Manolo Burty got into close contact with the Cubist painters in Paris. In 1909, Burty bought Picasso's Factory at Horta de Ebro. In 1910, Frank Burty Haviland went to the South of France with Manolo and De S√©verac, and he bought a monastery in C√©ret, in the French Pyrenees, which became the center of the so-called School of C√©ret until 1914. It included some of the most important painters of the time, with Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Georges Braque, Max Jacob and Auguste Herbin. Burty Haviland married Jos√©phine Laporta, a girl from C√©ret, in 1914. Frank Burty was portrayed by Amedeo Modigliani in 1914, and is probably also the subject of the 1913 The Smoker by Juan Gris. Chaim Soutine's Le Rouquin from 1917-1919 is also supposed to be a portrait of Burty Haviland. His bust was made by his friend Manolo Hugu√©. In April 1914, he had a solo exhibition at the 291 gallery of Alfred Stieglitz. In 1915, his work was included in the first exhibition in Marius de Zayas' \\"Modern Gallery\\" in New York City, together with works by Picasso, Braque, de Zayas, Francis Picabia, and others. His work was also included in exhibitions in that gallery over the next few years. In November 1917, Burty had a solo exhibition at the Galerias Dalmau in Barcelona, and in 1921, he had a solo exhibition in the Brummer Gallery in New York. His later style was more classical, moving away from the Cubism of his early career. Burty Haviland lived most of his life in C√©ret and was one of the driving factors behind the creation the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de C√©ret in 1950, helping it to acquire 14 works by Henri Matisse and over 50 works by Picasso. He was the conservator of the museum from 1957 until 1961. When the museum acquired the Burty archive, including 83 paintings and over 700 drawings, in 2008, they held a retrospective exhibition about him from 5 December 2009 until 30 May 2010.

With the huge success of It Happened One Night, the 1934 American romantic comedy film directed by Frank Capra and starring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, every studio in Hollywood attempted to cash in with a similar storyline. In addition to this film, there was also Love on the Run (1936) from MGM, The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941) by Warner Bros.; even Columbia Pictures, which had made It Happened One Night, produced the musical remake Eve Knew Her Apples (1945). Plot High-profile heiress Diane North (Wendy Barrie) stows away in the trailer of a bacteriologist Dr. Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Smith (Gene Raymond) to escape from her own wedding. Larry has to drive cross country to San Francisco to catch a ship to China, where he will work with an eminent expert on a cure for a serious disease. When he discovers his stowaway, Diane tells him she is poverty-stricken Maggie \\"Jonesy\\" Jones, making her way to a slightly less poor uncle. Larry tries to get rid of his passenger at every opportunity, but she falls in love and uses every wile to stay with him. Meanwhile, her wealthy, ditsy mother (Hedda Hopper) offers a reward for her safe return, fearing she has been kidnapped, but her fiance Walter Corbett remains remarkably blase about the whole thing. At a lunch counter, two grifters recognize Diane, and sneak aboard the trailer, but not before conning Orestes (Billy Gilbert), the diner's cook, into giving them two $10 bills for $5. Orestes finally figures out he has been conned and telephones for the police. All four are taken to the Omaha police station. Police Captain G. G. Burke finally sorts things out and lets Larry and Diane go. They get married. Then, at one stop, Diane secretly calls her mother and asks her to do something to stop Larry from going to China (which he insists on doing alone). Larry hears on the radio that the famous doctor has found a cure, so he no longer has a reason to go. He also discovers Diane's true identity, and promptly dumps her. On his way back through Omaha, he is arrested. Captain Burke is sure he kidnapped and possibly murdered Diane, and is frustrated when the alleged victim shows up looking for her husband. Diane confesses to Larry that the news story was faked by her mother. He leaves once more for San Francisco, by air as time is running short. On board the ship, Larry is delighted to be invited to dine with the captain, until he discovers that the guest of honor is one of the owners of the shipping line: Diane. He storms out, but she persuades him to take her back.

During that period, regional administration in Zeta was often bestowed to various members of the ruling dynasty, who administered the region as a crown land. Name \\"Zeta\\", at the time of Mihailo I, was a ≈æupa within Duklja (known as Lu≈°ka ≈æupa). From the end of the 11th century the name was also used to refer to all of Duklja, first used in Kekaumenos' military manual written in the 1080s. The term Zeta gradually replaced Duklja over the decades to denote the region. History Serbian Prince Desa Uro≈°eviƒá conquered Duklja and Travunia in 1148, combining the title as \\"Prince of Primorje\\" (the Maritime) and co-ruled Serbia with his brother Uro≈° II Prvoslav from 1149 to 1153, and alone until 1162. In 1190, Grand ≈Ωupan of Rascia and Stefan Nemanja's son, Vukan II, asserted his right over Zeta. In 1219, ƒêorƒëe Nemanjiƒá succeeded Vukan. He was succeeded by his second oldest son, Uro≈° I, who built the 'Uspenje Bogorodice' monastery in Moraƒça. Between 1276 and 1309, Zeta was ruled by Queen Jelena, widow of Serbia's King Uro≈° I. She restored around 50 monasteries in the region, most notably Saint Srƒë and Vakh on the Bojana River. From 1309 to 1321, Zeta was co-ruled by the oldest son of King Milutin, Young King Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski. Similarly, from 1321 to 1331, Stefan's young son Stefan Du≈°an Uro≈° IV Nemanjiƒá, the future Serbian King and Emperor, co-ruled Zeta with his father. Reign of Stefan Du≈°an Du≈°an the Mighty was crowned Emperor in 1331, and ruled until his death in 1355. ≈Ωarko held the Lower Zeta region: he is mentioned in records from 1356, when he raided some traders from Dubrovnik, not far from Sveti Srƒë at Lake Skadar. Zeta itself was held by the widow of Du≈°an, Jelena, who at the time was in Serres where she had her court. The next year, in June, ≈Ωarko becomes a citizen of the Republic of Venice, where he was known as \\"baron lord of the Serbian King, with holdings in the Zeta region and Bojana of the maritime\\". ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá was \\"Head\\" (Kefalija, from Greek Kephale) of Upper Zeta until his murder in 1362. ƒêura≈° had been killed by the sons of a Bal≈°a, a nobleman that held one village during the reign of Du≈°an.Zeljko Fajfriƒá: Sveta loza Stefana Nemanje \\"Posle toga krenuo je sa svojim ljudima na osvajanje Gornje Zete, koju je dr≈æao ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá i njegovi roƒëaci. ƒêura≈°a ubi≈°e Bal≈°ini sinovi, neke njegove roƒëake zarobi≈°e, a ostali napusti≈°e zemlju.

The role was played by actress Fiona Hutchison, who debuted in the role February 20, 1987. Hutchison briefly reprised the role for the series finale January 6 and 9, 2012. Storyline Gabrielle first appears when former boyfriend Max Holden (James DePaiva) visits her native Argentina with his new girlfriend, Tina Lord (Andrea Evans), in 1987. Gabrielle's drug lord father, Dante Medina (Henry Darrow), is killed and Tina is presumed dead after plummeting over the Iguazu Falls. She turns up alive as Gabrielle secretly gives birth to Max's son; Gabrielle is soon duped by Tina into letting Tina pass the child off as her own. Gabrielle believes that Tina is raising the child with Max, but Tina actually pretends the child is hers with estranged husband Cord Roberts (John Loprieno), hoping to reconcile with him. Gabrielle moves to Llanview in July 1987, and the truth is eventually revealed, leading her to reunite with her son, Al. Max and Gabrielle fight their passionate attraction to one another after she marries his brother, Steve Holden, in 1988. After Gabrielle and Steve divorce, she orchestrates a baby switch involving Steve's baby with fiancee Brenda McGillis (Brenda Brock) to prevent her friend Michael Grande (Dennis Parlato) from learning that his newborn son actually died; Gabrielle and Michael get engaged, but once the switch is exposed, the relationship ends. Gabrielle goes on trial but is given a slap on the wrist; she and Max reunite and marry in 1990. In 1991, mob boss Carlo Hesser (Thom Christopher) blackmails Gabrielle to aid him in his plot to poison newspaper publisher Viki Lord Buchanan (Erika Slezak). Gabrielle eventually backs out and testifies against Carlo in trial for Viki's attempted murder. She ends up accepting the blame and goes to jail for seven years to protect her young son Al from Carlo's wrath in 1991. After her stint in Statesville Prison, Gabrielle returns to Llanview in 2001 and marries billionaire Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) as part of her scheme to destroy Max, with whom she is angry for being a dead-beat father to Al. Gabrielle and Asa plot to fake Asa's death and frame Max for the \\"murder,\\" but Gabrielle ends up falling in love with Max again. Asa catches wind of this and, suspecting Gabrielle and Max are plotting to kill him for real, decides to fake his own death without her help and frame both Gabrielle and Max for his \\"death.\\" The truth is uncovered when Asa's son, Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods), finds him hiding out on St. Blaze's Island. Upon his return to Llanview, Asa divorces Gabrielle, throwing her out of the mansion and leaving her with no clothes, no money, and no home. Angry with his father, Bo invites Gabrielle to live with him in his garret but demands that she find herself a job. Gabrielle overhears information with which she can blackmail Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) to give her a job as Style Editor of his newspaper, The Sun. Bo suspects foul play and demands the truth from Gabrielle. When she finally admits to her crimes, she expects that Bo will throw her out of his home, but he surprises her by asking her to stay. Gabrielle and Bo grow very close while living together, and they eventually fall in love and begin dating seriously, which allows her to become a less vindictive person. When Bo's ex-wife, Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith), becomes the Assistant District Attorney, Gabrielle becomes jealous and insecure with her relationship with Bo, but he assures her that he and Nora are over. When Gabrielle learns that Matthewis really Bo's son, she keeps the truth from them both but eventually confesses to Bo. Nora is furious, but Bo forgives Gabrielle and assures her that he doesn't want to break up because of it and that he still wants Gabrielle in his life. After Gabrielle and Bo have a fight one night, she gets drunk and is taken advantage of by Troy MacIver (Ty Treadway). Despite her insistence that it was a mistake, Troy pursues Gabrielle to the point of near stalking her. Their clandestine meetings are caught on video by Jen Rappaport (Jessica Morris), and the footage soon becomes evidence in a possible homicide. Gabrielle destroys the evidence in a panic but promises to make up for it by going undercover to expose Troy's crimes. The plan goes wrong and Troy kidnaps Gabrielle and locks her in a morgue to die. Bo comes to her rescue just in time. Gabrielle's son, Al, soon becomes sick and in need of a liver transplant. Gabrielle offers to give part of her liver to save his life, but Al dies when the procedure fails. Grief- stricken, Gabrielle breaks off her engagement to Bo and moves out of the apartment. Bo convinces her not to give up on life, and the two resume their engagement after she moves back in. On New Year's Eve of 2003, Gabrielle is murdered by serial killer Dr. Stephen Haver (Matthew Ashford). When Bo is shot by Troy at the series finale in 2012, Gabrielle appears to Bo from Heaven, encouraging him to stay with her in the afterlife and \\"pick up where they left off\\".

Among those partners: * The Ministry of National Education (France) supports the project and has delegated several teachers to help on the content of the Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie. * The museums of other Central Banks which already exist, like those of the European Union or the Interactive Museum of Economics (MIDE), in Mexico. * Universcience, and especially the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie : Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France, and Claudie Haigner√©, head of Universcience, have signed a cooperation agreement on the museography of the future Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie. * The Institut pour l'Education Financi√®re du Public, with whom a partnership has been concluded in late 2010. * The Biblioth√®que nationale de France: Governor Christian Noyer and President of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Bruno Racine have signed a cooperation agreement on January 3, 2012, regarding the presentation of coin and banknote collections in the future Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie. * The Rencontres des SES : initiative developed by the Acad√©mie de Paris, where 11th grade students studying Economics and Social Sciences are invited to meet economists, in order to discuss themes linked to current issues. * The Little Conferences of the Nouveau Th√©√¢tre de Montreuil : a partnership with the Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie was announced on February 11, 2012, during Jean-Claude Trichet (former Banque de France Governor and former President of the European Central Bank)'s conference on the history of money. The partnership is developed around their shared objective of increasing young people's access to knowledge. The building The Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie will be hosted in the Hotel Gaillard, located at 1, Place du G√©n√©ral Catroux, in the 17th district in Paris. This neo-gothic mansion has been realized by architect Jules F√©vrier at request of Emile Gaillard, banker from the city of Grenoble and amateur and collector of Middle Ages and Renaissance art. The Hotel Gaillard was sold to the Banque de France in 1919. From 1919 to 1921, architectural works have been directed by architect Alphonse Defrasse for the Banque de France, especially the building of a steel structure which housed the cashier's desks and other services to the visitors. He also imagined the impressive strong room which could be accessed by a lift bridge, over two-meters-deep moats.Historical study on the Hotel Gaillard, led by the Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Litt√©rature (GRAHAL), on request of the Banque de France. Listed as a historic monument in 1999, this branch closed in 2006, as a consequence of the plan to close half of the Banque de France's branches on the French territory. The architectural contest The project of the Cit√© de l'√©conomie et de la monnaie was the object of an architectural contest. Over 100 teams of architects and museographers have participated in this contest which aimed at transforming this former branch of the Banque de France in an educational Cit√©, while respecting the architecture of the building which is listed as historic monument.

When the opportunity to avenge Stevie's death presents itself, Starkey cannot refuse. Movie A movie adaptation of the novel was planned in 2001, with Steve Bendelack attached as director. Reception The novel received little but positive coverage in the media. Reviewing for the Irish Post, Martin Doyle stated he found Bateman's novels to be \\"pitch-black comic thrillers\\" and called the novel \\"a helter-skelter of high jinks and low humour\\"; stating that while the novel is not \\"a demanding read\\" he found it to be \\"a rewarding one\\".

She was also the mother of Javanese hero- king Airlangga.Hanna, p.24 Her other younger sons are Marakata (later become king of Bali after the death of Udayana) and Anak Wung√ßu (ascend to Balinese throne after the death of Marakata). Early life Gunapriyadharmapatni was born in 961 and growing up in Watugaluh palace, East Java. She was a Javanese princess of East Javanese Isyana Dynasty, the daughter of king Sri Makutawangsawarddhana of late Medang Kingdom period. She was the sister of King Dharmawangsa of Medang. She was later betrothed to Balinese king Udayana, and moved to the island as a queen consort and assumed the name Mahendradatta. Marriage and reign Her powerful position as the princess of ruling Medang Kingdom has led the historian to suggests that actually Mahendradatta was the queen regnant in Bali. Her marriage to Medang's vassal, the Balinese Warmadewa family was a political arrangement to seal Bali as part of East Javanese Medang realm. Her position as powerful foreign queen has led the Balinese court to carefully respect, revered or even fear her. She conceived her first son, Airlangga, in her 30s, quite late of age for women in ancient Java and Bali. However, there is a speculation suggesting that Mahendradatta was probably already married prior to Udayana. Thus Airlangga was not the biological son of king Udayana, he was conceived from her previous union to an unknown man, that after her separation (either because of death or divorce) she was later betrothed to the Balinese king, and she took the baby Airlangga to Bali. Historical sources seems to be silenced on Mahendradatta's suspected earlier marriage, that it might be a scandal or not even took place. This suspicion was because although Airlangga was the eldest son of Mahendradatta, curiously he was not chosen as the crown prince of Bali, his younger brother Marakata and later Anak Wung√ßu rose to Balinese throne instead. Moreover, Mahendradatta sent Airlangga back to Java during his teenage. Mahendradatta was known to be promoting the cult of Durga in Bali, and curiously later associated with Balinese legend of evil witch Rangda, which translates to \\"widow\\". The Balinese folklore more or less mentioning the life story of Mahendradatta that linked with Balinese mythology of Rangda. The story goes that the queen was condemned and exiled by the king for allegedly practicing witchcraft and black magic. After she became a widow, hurt and humiliated, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband's court and the whole of his kingdom. She summoned all the evil spirits in the jungle, the and the demons that caused plague and death in the kingdom. She proceeded to take her revenge by killing off half the kingdom with plague before being overcome by a holy man. Her seemingly bad image in Balinese folklore was probably reflected her actual life that her marriage run bad, or motivated by Balinese court politics to discredit the ruling foreign Javanese queen. Her marriage probably was not a smooth one, that the queen was up against the court of Balinese Warmadewa and her own husband.  Religious adherent  Mahendradatta is known for her devotion to Durga. She was believed to bring the cult of Durga to Bali from Java. Although Durga is known as consort of Shiva, in ancient Javanese and Balinese traditions, Durga is depicted of having fierce nature, in contrast to another shakti; the benevolent Vishnu's consort Lakshmi. The cult of Durga is traditionally linked with sacrifice, black magic and witchcraft. This led to the unpopular depiction of her, that later associated with Rangda, the evil witch in Balinese mythology. After her death in 1011 CE, she was deified and depicted as Durga Mahisashuramardini (Durga as the slayer of Bull-demon), entombed in the temple within Pura Bukit Dharma Kutri, located in Buruan village, Blahbatu, Gianyar Regency, Bali. Within this Balinese temple compound, exist several Hindu-Buddhist statues dated from around 10th to 13th century. Those include, but not limited to the depictions of Amoghapasa, Ganesha, Bhatara, Durga Mahisasuramardhini, and Buddha. Notes References * Willard A. Hanna (2004). Bali Chronicles.

The state included parts of modern Montenegro and parts of modern Albania. Background In 1421, before his death and under the influence of his mother Jelena, Bal≈°a III passed the rule of Zeta to Serbian Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. Despot Stefan fought the Republic of Venice and regained Bar in mid-1423, and in 1424 his nephew ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá regained Drivast and Ulcinium (Ulcinj). With the death of Despot Stefan in 1427, his nephew ƒêuraƒë inherited the rule of Serbia. History Ascent to power The most important roles in establishing this family's rule in Zeta were played by Stefan I Crnojeviƒá (1451‚Äì1465) and his son Ivan (1465‚Äì1490). Ivan's son ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá (1490‚Äì1496) was the last ruler from this dynasty. Stefan I Stefan I Crnojeviƒá consolidated his power in Zeta and ruled for 14 years, from 1451 until 1465. During his rule, he saw the Despotate completely subdued by the Ottomans soon after the death of Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Under Stefan Crnojeviƒá, Zeta comprised the Lovƒáen area around Cetinje, 51 municipalities which included the Crnojeviƒá River, the Zeta Valley, and the clans of Bjelopavliƒái, Pje≈°ivci, Malonsiƒái, Piperi, Hoti, Klimenti and others. The population of the territories controlled by Stefan was ca. 30,000, while the total population of the Zeta region (including territories under foreign rule) was ca. 80,000. Capitalising on the weak position of Despot ƒêuraƒë, the Venetians and Herzog Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça of St. Sava (the region of Herzegovina is named after him) conquered parts of his territory. Stefan I Crnojeviƒá, who had already established himself as the head of the Crnojeviƒá (around 1451) in Upper Zeta was forced to make territorial concessions. In addition, Kosaƒça took Stefan's son Ivan as a political hostage, hoping it would force Stefan to side with him whenever needed. Stefan married Mara, a daughter of a prominent Albanian Gjon Kastrioti, whose son was the Albanian national hero, Skanderbeg. In 1455, Stefan entered into an agreement with his ally Venice, stipulating that Zeta would recognize the nominal supremacy of Venice while maintaining its factual independence in virtually every respect. The agreement also stipulated that Zeta would assist Venice militarily on specific occasions in exchange for an annual provision. But in all other respects, Stefan's rule in Zeta was undisputed. Ivan Ivan Crnojeviƒá became ruler of Zeta in 1465. His rule lasted until 1490. Immediately after taking the throne, Ivan attacked Venice, breaking the alliance his father had forged. He fought Venice in an attempt to capture Kotor. He had some success, gaining increasing support from the coastal Slavic tribes of Grbalj and Pa≈°troviƒái in his quest to assert control over the Bay of Kotor. But when the Ottoman campaign in northern Albania and Bosnia convinced him that the main source of danger to his country was to the East, he sought a compromise with Venice. Ivan fought numerous battles against the Turks. Zeta and Venice fought against the Ottoman Empire. The war ended with the successful defense of Shkodra, where Venetian, Shkodran, and Zetan defenders fought off forces of against Turkish Sultan Mehmed II and eventually won the war in 1474. However, the Ottomans besieged Shkodra again in 1478, with Mehmed II coming personally to lead that siege. After the Ottomans failed to take Shkodra by direct force, they assaulted ≈Ωabljak and took it without resistance.Babinger, Franz. Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time. New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1978. p. 365 Venice ceded Shkodra to the sultan in 1479 in Treaty of Constantinople. Ivan had aspirations to organise an anti-Turkish alliance consisting of Napolitan, Venetian, Hungarian, and Zetan forces. However, his dream could not be fulfilled since the Venetians did not dare to help Ivan after their peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Left on his own, Ivan managed to preserve Zeta from frequent Ottoman offensives. Knowing that the Ottomans would try to punish him for fighting on the Venetian side, and in order to preserve his independence, in 1482 he moved his capital from ≈Ωabljak on Lake Skadar to the mountainous area of Dolac, under Mount Lovƒáen. There he built the Orthodox Cetinje Monastery, around which the capital, Cetinje, would emerge. ƒêuraƒë IV Oktoih from Cetinje ƒêuraƒë IV Crnojeviƒá became ruler of Zeta in 1490. His rule lasted until 1496. ƒêuraƒë, Ivan's oldest son, was an educated ruler. He is most famous for one historical act: he used the printing press brought to Cetinje by his father to print the first books in southeastern Europe, in 1493. The Crnojeviƒá printing press marked the beginning of the printed word among South Slavs. The press operated from 1493 through 1496, turning out religious books, five of which have been preserved: Oktoih prvoglasnik, Oktoih petoglasnik, Psaltir, Molitvenik, and ƒåetvorojevanƒëelje. ƒêuraƒë managed the printing of the books, wrote prefaces and afterwords, and developed sophisticated tables of Psalms with the lunar calendar. The books from the Crnojeviƒá press were printed in two colors, red and black, and were richly ornamented. They served as models for many books printed in Cyrillic. After the rule of Zeta was handed to ƒêuraƒë, his youngest brother, Stani≈°a, with no chance to succeed his father, Ivan, went to Constantinople and converted to Islam, receiving the name of Skender. As a loyal servant of the Sultan, Stani≈°a became the Sanjak-bey of Shkodra. His brothers, ƒêuraƒë and Stefan II, continued the struggle against Ottomans. The historical facts are unclear and disputed, but it seems that the Venetians, frustrated by their own inability to subdue the House of Crnojeviƒá to their own interests, managed to kill Stefan II and deceitfully sent ƒêuraƒë to Constantinople. Principally, ƒêuraƒë visited Venice to work on the wide anti- Ottoman campaign, but was kept in captivity for some time while Stefan II was defending Zeta against the Ottomans. It is likely that upon his return to Zeta, ƒêuraƒë was kidnapped by the Venetian agents and sent to Constantinople under the accusation that he had been organizing a Holy War against Islam. There are some unreliable claims that ƒêuraƒë was given Anatolia to rule, but in any case the reports about ƒêuraƒë's whereabouts ceased after 1503. Aftermath After the death of ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá, Zeta was ruled by his brother Stefan II, an Ottoman vassal. This marked the beginning of the end of the Crnojeviƒá family as rulers of Zeta. Zeta was administratively part of the Sanjak of Scutari from 1499 to 1514. During this period, while Brda and North- West of Montenegro were nominally independent, the part of Zeta under Mount Lovƒáen remained entirely independent. By the end of the 15th century, Upper Zeta comprised the nahije of Katun, Rijeka, Crmnica, and Lje≈°. In 1514, the Sanjak of Montenegro was established by order of Sultan Bayezid II; it was a separate sanjak with parts that were previously in the Sanjak of Scutari. Ivan Crnojeviƒá's son Stani≈°a converted to Islam and became \\"Skenderbeg\\" and was chosen as the first sanjakbey and governed the sanjak until 1528. Despite Skenderbeg's emphasized cruelty, Ottomans did not have real power in Zeta. The real power was in the hands of tribal heads. From 1534 onwards, there is no more mention of the Crnojeviƒás in Zeta. They reappeared in history as ƒåarnojeviƒás; the most prominent member was Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá (1633‚Äì1706). Zeta was turned into a theocratic state by the Metropolitans of Zeta when they seized the power in 1516. In Zeta, the position of the Metropolitan (vladika, or prince-bishop) substituted leadership of Zeta, and brought stability. The link between church and state elevated it in the eyes of the peasantry, gave it an institutionalized form of succession that prevented its becoming a matter of contest between minor chieftains, and excluded the possibility of compromising alliances with the Ottomans. Upper Zeta later became known as \\"Montenegro\\" (meaning black mountain) because the mountain realm, though isolated, was visible to Venetian speaking merchants and seamen operating out of the ports of Cattaro (Kotor) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) on the Dalmatian coast. Indeed, access to the region was only possible by way of the perilous Steps of Cattaro that twist their way steeply into the dark, forbidding mountains above the town. The Ottomans had controlled a part of Zeta since 1498, that was known as the Sanjak of Montenegro, the Republic of Venice controlled Cattaro and the Vladikas of Montenegro controlled the rest.Kada je Zeta postala Crna Gora References Sources *Dr ≈Ωeljko Fajfriƒá ‚Äì Sveta loza Stefana Nemanje, 1998 *J.

In 2006 he founded and currently leads an Information Technology consulting firm, formed by Ponder and several of his former business associates. The group specializes in managing large-scale business and government technology program implementations, information technology group transformations and providing leadership on troubled projects. Early life Ponder was born in El Dorado, Arkansas. Shortly after his birth, his father died and his mother, a telephone operator, returned with him to the family farm. Ponder was raised by his mother and grandparents who owned a sizeable farm, general store, feed business and service station. Starting at a very young age, and continuing through his college years, he worked closely with his grandfather in the family business.Wagnon, Bill (June 1997), \\"Ron Ponder Leads AT&T; into the Information Future\\", Mississippi Alumnus: Summary 1997. Mississippi State University College of Business and Industry. When Ponder was in high school, his mother remarried and the family moved to Magnolia, Arkansas, where he completed high school and college. After completing his undergraduate work in Industrial Management and Engineering, scholarships eventually led him to both Louisiana Tech University for an MBA and Mississippi State University, where he completed his Doctorate in Business Administration. He majored in Operations Research and Computer Science, the latter a fairly new and embryonic field of study. Education  Upon completing his work for his Doctoral Degree, Ponder stayed and taught in the College of Business and Industry at Mississippi State University for the next year. From there, he went to Georgia State University in Atlanta as a University Professor in the College of Business and Quantitative Methods. He left Georgia State to join the College of Business and Industry at the University of Memphis, where he taught quantitative management, statistical decision theory and applied programming languages. He was a Professor at the University of Memphis for five years. During this time, at the University of Memphis, he was consulting part-time with companies in the area when he met his new neighbor, a young pilot for a fledgling new cargo airline named Federal Express. After some discussion, the pilot suggested that Ponder should meet Charles Brandon and Frederick W. Smith, the Founder and CEO. Their association led Ponder to two years of consulting for Brandon and Smith at Federal Express in the early 70's, performing Operations Research for the company. As the funds ran out, Ponder and one of his graduate student assistants completed their last project pro bono. Employment In 1975 Ponder and accepted a full-time position with Helena Chemical Company, a multi-billion dollar agricultural chemical distributor headquartered in Memphis. As Director of Data Processing for the company, Ponder began to build experience in information technology. In July of his second year at Helena Chemical, two former colleagues from Federal Express were finally able to fund a position for Ponder as Director of Operations Research. Ponder eventually assembled a team of 22 Operations Research staff. Throughout his career at Federal Express, Ponder was responsible for system strategies, systems simulation and network planning that went with it. In 1979, Ponder was promoted to the position of Vice President, Operations Planning. In addition to his staff responsibilities in this role, he also had the opportunity to work closely with Smith and COO, James L. Barksdale.VanSimpson, Charleen.

Following that effort, for the last 4 years, The Ponder Group has provided senior level consulting services to the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census. This work has primarily focused on large scale IT program management for the planning and implementation of the information required for the 2010 Census. This has been an ongoing project through 2011.

During his tenure at AT&T;, he supported the work that led to AT&T; receiving two Baldridge Awards. The Deming Quality Award was also awarded to the Global Network Group under his leadership at AT&T; during the same time period.

Plot A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun ‚Äî specifically, a .38 special revolver ‚Äî as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition. The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized. His wife is uncomfortable with the weapon in the house and convinces him to get rid of it. He gives it away to a security guard at his company, who pawns the gun. A young professional asks for a gun at the pawn shop. He is displeased when told there is a five-day waiting period required by law. When the pawnbroker turns to get the blank paperwork, he loads the gun with his own bullets and departs at gunpoint after paying for the pistol. At his place of employment, he is given the news that because he has the least seniority, he is being laid off. He considers shooting his supervisor before walking outside to the building's plaza during lunchtime, making mock shooting motions at random bystanders with the gun. They are alarmed and call the police. When the police arrive, he throws the gun through the open window of a parked car before he is arrested. Two women get in the car, driving it to a car wash where an employee, Ignacio, discovers the gun under the front seat while vacuuming the interior. He takes it to his home in the barrio, where his brother and his pregnant wife both object to its presence. One day, the gun and his elderly father both go missing. They search and finally realize that after the recent death of his best friend, the father is depressed and considering suicide at the grave of his late wife. After stopping him, Ignacio throws the gun and bullets into a dumpster. A nearby worker sees the action, retrieves the gun and sells it to an illicit gun dealer. The gun dealer sells the gun to a man who supplies criminals. The duo the pistol is intended for is planning to rob a porn theater's box office receipts, but their third member had second thoughts and backed out. After much wheedling, he agrees to be their lookout and getaway driver, keeping the pistol in his lap. At the theater, the owner recognizes the younger man in the duo as a former employee despite a ski mask. He pulls his own gun and threatens the robbers, as well as activating the silent alarm. They finally attempt to flee, but are immediately arrested outside. Much later, the pistol is taken with a cache of other weapons for disposal at a scrapyard. It somehow survives intact after passing through the metal shredder and is picked up by the driver of a dump truck hired to haul the scrap to a steel mill. He takes it home, where his wife is concerned that their young son will find it. He promises to lock it up. One day, he is delayed by a breakdown of his truck. The bored boy looks through his parents' bedroom, finds the loaded gun on a closet shelf and starts to play with it, finally pointing the barrel towards his face. The camera pans away ‚Äî and as the scene shows a shock-cut to black, the sound of the gun firing can be heard. It is implied (but never actually shown) that the boy has accidentally shot himself to his own death with the only bullet the gun ever fired. Availability The Gun has never been released on home video in any format or medium.

The site in the Coronado National Forest is used with special permission from the United States Forest Service by the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona. History The Catalina Station site was selected by Gerard P. Kuiper of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at the University of Arizona in 1960. He believed that a slightly higher location than an alternate site at Kitt Peak National Observatory would be better for LPL's purposes, and Mt. Bigelow was both higher and easily accessible from the University of Arizona via the Catalina Highway. Construction began in late 1962 and the first telescope, a 21-inch reflector, began operating in early 1963. At this time the site was known as Catalina Observatory. The first telescope was at CS Site I, and later in 1963 a 28-inch telescope opened at CS Site II, about to the southeast. In 1965 a 61-inch telescope was opened at Site I, followed by two similar 60-inch telescopes at Site II shortly thereafter. In 1969 a 40-inch reflector was erected near Site II, adjacent to a FAA transmitter. As a condition for occupying the Mount Lemmon Observatory (MLO) site, the USFS required LPL to vacate Site II, which was completed in 1972. The 40-inch telescope remained until 1975, when it too was moved to Mount Lemmon Observatory. In 1972, a 28-inch Schmidt camera replaced the 21-inch reflector. The 61-inch Kuiper and the Schmidt camera continue to be used today, though they have been upgraded several times. In 1978, the site was transferred from the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory to the Steward Observatory. In 1989, it was first referred to as the Catalina Site, and is currently known as the Catalina Station. Telescopes * The Kuiper Telescope, previously known as the NASA Telescope, was built in 1965.

Founded in 1889, it is located at 188 Lowther Avenue at Walmer Road, in The Annex neighbourhood. History Early in 1889 Elmore Harris, then pastor Bloor Street Baptist Church (later to become Yorkminster Park Baptist Church), became convinced that there was need for a new ministry in the area in north-western part of Toronto that had been recently annexed to the city. After consulting with his congregation it was decided that Walmer Road was the most suitable spot for the church. Elmore Harris' father, Alanson Harris of Brantford (founder of A. Harris, Son & Co. Ltd.) purchased the lot on Walmer Road at the corner of what was soon to become Lowther Avenue, at a cost of $7,600. In April 1889, Elmore Harris resigned as pastor of Bloor Street Church, effective October 15, 1889. The first building (which can now be identified by the short tower some distance west along Lowther Avenue) was completed and opened on October 20, 1889. Sixty-two people transferred from the Bloor Street Church and became the Charter members. By 1891 the membership was already about 350 and in December it was decided that more space was necessary. Mr. Alanson Harris and Mrs. John Harris, immediately agreed to provide the funds. And what is now the main sanctuary of the church was erected at a cost of $70,000. Upon completion it was the largest Baptist building in Canada. The dedication of the new sanctuary took place on November 6, 1892. Throughout its more than 125 years, Walmer Road Baptist Church has been a community of believers with a commitment to outreach and service in the Annex and a strong reputation for creative leadership by skilled pastors and involved lay people. A detailed history of the church can be found in two documents: A Century for the City published in 1989 and Walmer at 125 published in 2014. Architecture Walmer Road Baptist Church was designed and built in 1889 and 1892 in the Gothic Revival style by the architectural firm of Henry Langley and Edmund Burke. The interior of the church was built to accommodate 1540 people on the floor and in the galleries. The church entered its next and last building program in 1912. A new structure was erected in the space between the two older buildings, and was dedicated as the Ruth Shenstone Harris Memorial Church School on January 18, 1914. A comprehensive renovation of this Education Wing was undertaken in 2000. Outreach Outreach and church planting was a key activity of the church from the very beginning. Christie Street Mission was founded in 1898 by the congregation from Walmer Road. In 1907 it became Christie Street Baptist Church under pastor H. R. Nobles. Spadina Road Mission was born in 1907 to serve the area at Spadina and St. Clair Ave. In 1914 the Mission merged with Wychwood Road Baptist Church just to the west, when a new bridge across the ravine brought that church within easy reach. Hewitt Avenue Mission was begun in 1909 in the Brockton Village neighbourhood (now Roncesvalles, Toronto) on Hewitt Avenue. It eventually became High Park Baptist Church. Memorial Institute became a ministry of Walmer in October 1911, when they agreed to take over the work of Memorial Baptist Church, on Tecumseth Street south west of Queen and Bathurst in downtown Toronto. A significant ministry to poor people living in downtown Toronto continued in this location until 1942 when it ceased operation. Training the laity In 1894, Elmore Harris and Dr. William Stewart, a Walmer supporter, suggested that the church provide space for a lay training institute to be known as the Toronto Bible Training School. Stewart became the first Principal. Courses were held at Walmer Road church for the first four years and then they relocated to new facilities at 110 College Street in 1898. The vision of the founders was to train laypeople as Sunday School teachers, pastors' assistants, and as city, home and foreign missionaries. Initially the training program was two years. In 1912 it became the Toronto Bible College and is now the Tyndale University College and Seminary. During Howard Bentall's time as pastor in the 1950s, a vision for a lay training institute was once again revived and beginning in September 1955 the Baptist Training Institute (BTI) was formed. It was designed as a one-year lay training program and at first, classes were conducted at the church. In 1959, BTI was relocated to Brantford, Ontario. Pastors Elmore Harris served from October 1889 to November 27, 1895 when he resigned as pastor on account of failing health. Harris continued to serve in an advisory capacity until his death in 1911. Rev. W. W. Weeks, from First Baptist Church, Moncton, New Brunswick, began at Walmer Road Church in December 1895. The membership at that date was 480. By 1900 it was 700. Mr. Weeks was considered \\"an earnest preacher and a most indefatigable worker\\". He served until 1904. Weeks was followed in 1905 by Oliver Horsman from New Jersey, but he was soon involved in a doctrinal controversy and resigned in January, 1906. John MacNeill arrived in 1906 from First Baptist Church in Winnipeg. At 32 years old he already had a growing reputation as a preacher and evangelist. He had studied at McMaster University and knew Toronto well. He proved to be the pastor Walmer needed at a difficult time. During his 23 years at Walmer, the church grew to a membership of over 2,000. MacNeill resigned in 1930 to become the Principal of the Theological Faculty of McMaster University. At the same time McMaster was relocated to Hamilton Ontario. The man chosen in 1930 to fill the enormous shoes of John MacNeill was Dr. Herbert H. Bingham. Coming from First Baptist Calgary, Bingham faced a difficult task. Although a strong preacher and evangelist, and much-loved by the congregation, he faced the twin challenges of succeeding a beloved and famous pastor, and leading the church through a time of great economic hardship. It is said of him, however, that he never became discouraged, even in the darkest days of the depression. In 10 1/2 years, he added 766 members, over 350 by baptism. In June 1940, Dr. Bingham resigned to become the first full-time general secretary of the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec, and in these early days of World War II, the church turned to Adiel Jarrett Moncrief, who began his ministry October 26, 1941. Like Bingham, Moncrief came from a large church (First Baptist Church in Tampa, Florida), was the author of numerous books and had an excellent reputation as a leader. Walmer represented a significant challenge. Moncrief's main task was to pastor a church in wartime; the atmosphere in the congregation was a sense of a painful task that must be done. He served effectively through the war years but on December 28, 1945, Adiel Moncrief submitted his resignation. In 1947 Walmer Road called Howard Bentall, a young Western Canadian, the pastor of First Baptist, Regina. He possessed a gift they valued highly: preaching. Bentall arrived November 3, 1946, and the results of his ministry were soon evident. The next decade saw growth in many areas including work with young people and ESL programs as well as a renewed commitment to mission. In 1959, Howard Bentall resigned, after almost 13 years of very fruitful ministry‚Äîa period of service second only in length to John MacNeill's. During those years, about 800 members were added, 215 by baptism. When Bentall left for First Baptist Church, Calgary, he was replaced by a Maritimer, Harvey L. Denton, who commenced his ministry on September 20, 1959. Denton came from Murray Street Baptist in Peterborough. Much of Denton's relatively brief time at Walmer‚Äîhe retired in 1963‚Äîwould be spent assessing the implications a report on ministry. In 1963 Harvey Denton resigned. He was followed by Reginald S. Dunn, also from the Atlantic provinces. Reg Dunn was a leader and enabler. Dunn came to Walmer on February 6, 1964 after 11 years at First Baptist Church in Montreal and would facilitate one of the most exciting phases of ministry in Walmer's history. Reg Dunn had a very simple philosophy: work hard in one area; that area was community outreach. However he maintained a traditional program within the church allowing the familiarity of the worship, and the educational and social programs within Walmer to provide the stability needed to support the outreach. He served as President of the Canadian Council of Churches from 1966‚Äì1969. In 1971, Reg Dunn resigned, moving to Amherst, Nova Scotia. To lead Walmer through the 1970s, the congregation turned to Bruce W. Neal, an Ontario native, from James Street Baptist Church in Hamilton. He arrived at Walmer in 1973 with a reputation as an excellent preacher and worship leader. He was also noted for being in touch with the real world. Neal's 12 years at Walmer saw a growing young adult ministry and a renewed look at worship. Bruce Neal resigned in the spring of 1984. The length of his tenure as senior pastor was exceeded only by those of MacNeill and Bentall. In October 1984, Dr. Daniel Dryer arrived bringing a love for the city and a renewed concern for the Annex community. Under his leadership a number of innovative moves were made in the lead up to the celebration of Walmer's centennial in 1989 including the establishment of house groups as a formal part of the church's discipleship program. During this time the BCOQ's BUILD program was partially housed at the church. At the end of 1993 Dan Dryer retired. In July 1995, Michael Blair was called to be the new senior pastor. Blair brought an effective preaching ministry as well as administrative skills. He helped the church work toward a new structure for leadership and guided the church to create the concept of the Walmer Centre in preparation for the major renovation of the education wing of the church that was undertaken in 2000. In 2001 Michael Blair resigned. After a lengthy search, in February 2004, Steve Cox was called as Lead Pastor bringing to the community his deep commitment to evangelism and his considerable skills in guiding worship. Steve's wife, Buff (Elizabeth)‚Äîalso an ordained minister‚Äîjoined the pastoral staff as Director of Administration in 2008. Among many other activities, under her guidance a major project \\"Under the Roof \\" allowed the replacement of the slate on the north side of the sanctuary roof. However, following a valiant two-year battle with cancer, Buff died in 2012 and in early 2014, Steve Cox resigned after ten years of ministry at Walmer. In December 2015 Rev. Elaine Poproski from First Baptist Church, Simcoe Ontario, accepted a call to Walmer. She began her ministry here on Palm Sunday 2016.

Governance IRI governance resides in its membership. Each member organization is responsible for choosing a voting representative to vote on its behalf in IRI elections. A simple majority is required for any action to be taken. The membership is led by an elected sixteen-member Board of Directors, with each member serving three years. The board also appoints a president who serves as Chief Staff Administrator and deciding voter should a tie occur.IRI Constitution and Bylaws, accessed Feb. 13, 2012. Membership To qualify for membership, an organization should have as its primary purpose the creation, production, and marketing of physical or intellectual products or services based on technological innovation. Federal laboratories involved in technological innovation, research, design, or technical support of products and services may also join as Associate Members. The Board of Directors retains the right to offer limited membership to others at its discretion.IRI Constitution and Bylaws, accessed Feb. 13, 2012. Membership includes free attendance passes to IRI events and a subscription to IRI's official journal, Research-Technology Management (RTM). Publications The Institute maintains a bimonthly journal, Research-Technology Management (RTM), originally titled Research Management. It publishes peer-reviewed articles covering the full spectrum of technological innovation, from R&D; through product development to commercialization. Oversight of the journal is provided by an appointed Board of Editors; the Editor-in-Chief and the Managing Editor provide day-to-day management. The Institute also issues monthly newsletters, press releases on important events, and occasional white papers on a variety of topics.

USDA Forest Service: Purshia glandulosa. In: Fire Effects Information System [Online], Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It is found in the Great Basin region, Mojave Desert, and chaparral-sagebrush scrub ecotone in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi Mountains, Eastern Transverse Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges. Calflora: Purshia tridentata Other habitats include pinyon-juniper woodland, conifer forest, and Joshua tree woodland. This species arose via hybridization between Purshia stansburiana (Stansbury cliffrose) and Purshia tridentata (antelope bitterbrush) . It is sometimes considered a variety of the latter species. It can hybridize with both of its parent species. This plant can grow on many types of soils, mainly those that are well-drained. It can grow on sites that have little soil, such as rock outcrops, and it is a pioneer species of eroded rock habitat. It does not tolerate large amounts of water, especially in the summer, and it favors areas that have an annual precipitation around 10 inches. It is tolerant of fire, layering and resprouting easily after its aboveground parts burn. The varieties grow from . Description Purshia glandulosa is an evergreen shrub growing up to tall, but often remaining smaller depending on environmental conditions. It has a deep taproot which may extend nearly deep in the soil, an adaptation to drought. At times, the plant produces root nodules where it can fix nitrogen. The flowers are white. The bloom period can range from February through June, depending on the variety. It reproduces by seed, by layering, and by resprouting from its root crown. It can also regenerate from root bits that are severed several feet below ground. Regeneration from seed is relatively uncommon, because its seeds have low rates of germination and they do not easily yield seedlings that will survive. The seeds have a very hard coat and germinate better if they are stratified. Also, the plant does not produce seed until it is approximately 10 years old.

It is not deciduous, so its foliage is available to animals in the winter.
