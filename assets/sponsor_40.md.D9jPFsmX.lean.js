Discovery Size of Xiaotingia Xiaotingia is known from the holotype STM 27-2, an articulated and almost complete skeleton including the skull. It was probably collected in the Linglongta area, Jianchang, from the Tiaojishan Formation. Etymology Xiaotingia was first named by Xu Xing, You Hailu, Du Kai and Han Fenglu in 2011 and the type species is Xiaotingia zhengi. The generic name and specific name together honour Zheng Xiaoting.  Description  Xiaotingia lived around 155 million years ago which preceded Archaeopteryx that lived around 144 million years ago. Xiaotingia was morphologically similar to Archaeopteryx and was the size of a hen. It was about 60 cm long and weighed an estimated 0.82 kg. It looked like a small feathered dinosaur that lived in an arboreal environment. Like Archaeopteryx it had long forelimbs. Its femur was longer than its humerus, 84 mm as against 71 mm, which might indicate that it stood on its hind limbs and could use its forelimbs for flapping. Xiaotingia had feathers on its head, body, forelimbs and hind limbs. The feathers on the femur were quite long, measuring 55 mm. It also had long pennaceous feathers on its tibia and metatarsus. If Xiaotingia could fly short distances it might also have used its hind limbs as wings. Xiaotingia had a dentary tooth count probably less than 10 and teeth similar in morphology to those of basal avians. Classification The initial analysis by Xu et al. showed that Xiaotingia formed a clade with Archaeopteryx, Dromaeosauridae and Troodontidae to the exclusion of other groups traditionally seen as birds. Xu et al. therefore (re)defined the concepts of Deinonychosauria and Avialae to the extent that Archaeopteryx and Xiaotingia belonged to the Deinonychosauria in the clade Archaeopterygidae. This led to popular reports that \\"Archaeopteryx is no longer a bird\\", although Xu et al. noted that there are several competing definitions of the clade Aves currently in use, pointing out that their definitions are compatible with a traditional Aves with Archaeopteryx as a specifier. This was challenged by an analysis using different methods published several months later however, in which Archaeopteryx was again recovered as an avialan, while Xiaotingia remained closely allied to Anchiornis within the Troodontidae. In 2012, an expanded and revised version of the initial analysis also found Archaeopteryx to be avialan and Anchiornis to be troodontid, but recovered Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae rather than a close relative of Anchiornis within Troodontidae.

She graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in French and journalism, being fluent also in Greek and Spanish.Andrea Tantaros '01 As she was finishing her degree, Andrea worked as an intern for CNN's Crossfire program, when she helped cover the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Her journal notes during the experience depict her advising herself to \\"Make yourself invaluable. Ask questions...

After moving to New York City in 2005, she started Andrea Tantaros Media, which provided crisis management and media strategy consulting to Fortune 500 companies and political campaigns. Tantaros joined Fox News Channel in April 2010 as a political contributor. In 2011, she was named a co- host of The Five.

Within United Cities and Local Governments, the Interregional Mediterranean Commission is at the junction of three regional sections: Europe, Africa, and the Middle East/West Asia. The Mediterranean occupies a special place in UCLG due to the large amount of direct members in the three regions North, South, and East of the Mediterranean and because of the many cooperation initiatives that connect local authorities and the common policies for regional development. Following the Med Urbs program, a ‚Äúnetwork culture‚Äù of trans-Mediterranean local authorities was created in the Mediterranean, reinforced by the Euro- Mediterranean partnership: Medcities, the network of Euromed cities (previously the Euromed group of Eurocities), the Standing Committee for the Euro Mediterranean Partnership of Local and Regional Authorities (COPPEM), the Europe-MENA Urban Network, Latin Arch, the Inter-Mediterranean Commission of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR), and the European network of local authorities for peace in the Middle East (COEPPO) are some of the networks that intersect with a variety of networks of civil society, universities and initiatives of the private sector. It appeared that the three regional sections of UCLG together could reinforce exchanges and encourage taking into consideration the specific interests of local Mediterranean authorities, whether on matters related to Euro-Mediterranean relations or on strategic issues like decentralization, urban development, or the environment, particularly access to and water management.Presentation of the Mediterranean Commission Within the ‚ÄúMediterranean‚Äù context, the Mediterranean Commission brings added value as vital support to a dynamic process that will make possible: \\\\- Providing visibility and legibility to the numerous initiatives of local authorities in the Mediterranean. \\\\- Creating the necessary conditions for the actors of these initiatives to meet in order to share know- how and experiences, to avoid scattered and compartmentalized actions, and by doing so, to optimize their impact in the field; encouraging particularly North-South and South-South dialogue and knowledge exchanges. \\\\- Gaining recognition of the importance of the local institutional sphere as designers, managers, and leaders of development policies that are the closest to the citizens, in a region where governance indicators show it is urgent to bring centers of power closer to the population. \\\\- Bridging the gap between elected representatives and local decision-makers in the Mediterranean who due to longstanding conflicts, economic difficulties and cultural stereotypes stifle the feeling of sharing a common Mediterranean or Euro-Mediterranean destiny. \\\\- Promoting adequate consideration of political Mediterranean issues from the perspective of local authorities: peace in the Middle East, conflict prevention (‚ÄúPeace Keeping‚Äù), intercultural dialogue (North-North, North- South, and South-South) regional integration processes (Union of the Arab Maghreb), etc. History The creation of a Mediterranean Commission within UCLG is not a new idea. It was suggested in 2001 during the joint meeting in Tunis of the World Federation of United Cities and the International Union of Local Authorities (FMCU/IULA), before the unification congress of Paris in May 2004. During the congress in Paris, the President of the French Provence- Alpes-C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur (PACA) region, the mayors of Marseille, Rome, and Tunis and the founding and honorary presidents of UCLG relaunched the idea of a Commission suggesting it could have its headquarters in Marseille. The principle of a Mediterranean Commission was adopted by the Executive Council in S√£o Paulo and the creation of the Commission was ratified during the World Council of Beijing in June 2005. On May 18, 2005 a meeting was held in Marseille. Major local authorities of the Mediterranean and their national or international networks were invited to participate or to contribute in writing to the meeting during which a first definition of a ‚ÄúMediterranean Commission‚Äù of UCLG was prepared, including its members, objectives, and a tentative agenda. Milestones of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG: May 2006: A technical secretariat is set up in Marseille, financed by the City of Marseille and the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur Region, with the support of Cit√©s Unies France and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. November 2006: Constitution of the political organs representing the three shores of the Mediterranean with a three-year mandate. Omar EL JAZOULI, Mayor of Marrakech, becomes the first President of the Mediterranean Commission October 2007: The mandate of the Mediterranean Commission is renewed during the Second World Congress of UCLG in Jeju. February 2008: Mercedes Bresso, President of the Piedmont Region, becomes the second President of the Mediterranean Commission. 22 & 23 June 2008: Forum of Local and Regional Authorities of the Mediterranean. June 2009: Abdel Moumen ARISS, Mayor of Beirut, becomes the third President of the Mediterranean Commission. 17 to 20 November 2010: The third UCLG Congress, held in Mexico, sees the renewal of the mandate of the Mediterranean Commission for three years.The Mandate of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG renewed in Mexico Objectives The political scope of the Mediterranean Commission establishes UCLG as the largest framework for direct political exchanges between local elected representatives in the Mediterranean respecting a North-South balance that undertakes to: \\\\- Promote local and regional autonomy and the institutional reinforcement of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean, as well as their national networks or associations. To this end, the Commission favors structuring local authorities through its support to national associations of elected officials and local authorities of the South or by fostering their creation. \\\\- Assure direct exchanges between the many different actors on common issues at Mediterranean scale, for example, the organization of the Permanent Forum of Local and Regional Authorities of the Mediterranean, an opportunity for dialogue and a special occasion to amplify the voice of Mediterranean local authorities and to allow exchanges between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean politicians and actors. \\\\- Develop decentralized cooperation and initiatives advocating common values that respect Mediterranean specificities. \\\\- Engage in dialogue with donors of State and multilateral funds (French Development Agency, Bretton Woods Institutions, United Nations agencies, investment bank funds), and to promote closer relations with the institutions of the European Union (EU Parliament, EU Commission, Committee of the Regions) based on the expertise and the results obtained by the networks or by encouraging new types of collaboration. \\\\- Defend the role and participation of local authorities in the Barcelona Process-Union for the Mediterranean, the new Neighborhood Policy and overall within the Mediterranean partnership. \\\\- Seek to identify and promote concrete initiatives in favor of peace in the Middle East, conflict prevention (‚ÄúPeace Keeping‚Äù), intercultural dialogue, regional integration processes and development throughout the entire region, leading to long-term exchanges and partnerships between territories (North-South, South-South). \\\\- Engage in dialogue and take into consideration the work and proposals of civil society, in particular, economic actors, academics, and community associations. \\\\- Construct a more stable and prosperous Mediterranean space.Local Authorities want to contribute to the construction of a more stable and prosperous Mediterranean space Organisation Technical Committee: The technical committee consists of the heads of the principal European networks working in the Mediterranean, trans-Mediterranean networks, national associations of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean, and representatives of national, European, or international institutions working in the Mediterranean. Mediterranean Council: It is made up of elected local officials in positions of responsibility in European networks active in the Mediterranean, in trans-Mediterranean networks or national associations of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean. It includes representatives of local authorities from countries where there are no structured networks and may be open to actors of the civil society during its meetings. Bureau: The first bureau of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG was established in the Commission‚Äôs meeting during the World Council of UCLG held in Marrakech on Monday October 30, 2006. On the basis of a rotating tripartite presidency it was composed of elected members representing the three shores of the Mediterranean: for Europe: Mercedes Bresso, President of the Piedmont Region (Italy), for the Maghreb: Omar El Jazouli, Mayor of Marrakech (Morocco) and for the Middle East: Abdel Mounim Ariss, Mayor of Beirut (Lebanon). Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, Mayor of Marseille and Mr Michel Vauzelle, President of the Provence Alpes C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur Region, were the vice-presidents. Following the renewal of the mandate of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG at the World Congress of Mexico in November 2010, a new bureau will be constituted soon. The Commission‚Äôs Headquarters and the Technical Secretariat are located in Marseilles. Members The Mediterranean Commission is open to members of UCLG and to thematic or general networks of Mediterranean local and regional authorities. Territorial authorities that are not members of UCLG and that wish to join the Commission may do so by sending a written request to the president of the Commission. Activities In its technical dimension, the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG does not seek to be an additional network nor an additional operator. By becoming a center of resources, on a Mediterranean scale, for projects, procedures, and mechanisms concerning territorial authorities, the Mediterranean Commission offers an overview of strategies and opportunities in the region. It brings closer the supply and the needs in the cooperation process by: \\\\- Capitalizing on and disseminating knowledge and expertise in local and territorial management, urban development and decentralized cooperation‚Äîin a multilateral framework‚Äîby relaying calls for proposals, projects, or ideas for the implementation of innovative forms of cooperation. \\\\- Providing technical assistance to Mediterranean project leaders (local authorities and their networks and associations): assistance with legal, administrative, and financial aspects of the implementation of projects of local authorities and their networks. \\\\- Carrying on the technical assistance over the long term through the implementation of tools that will contribute to the visibility and evaluation of activities of local authorities: website, database, technical data, newsletter. \\\\- Carrying out action research on Mediterranean issues and publication of work aimed at practical applications, particularly the creation of groups of experts who may work on specific problems and/or geographical areas. \\\\- Organizing technical workshops and training on topics chosen by local authorities and their networks.Presentation of the objectives and the plan of action of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG Meetings MEETINGS ‚Ä¢ November 20, 2008 : Debate on the involvement of local and regional authorities in Euro-Mediterranean policies, Marseille (France).The involvement of local and regional authorities in EuroMediterranean policies, within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean ‚Ä¢ May 25 & 26, 2009 : Regional seminar for local authorities - Balkans : ‚ÄúMethods and tools for the development of territories‚Äù, in Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina).Conclusions of the Sarajevo regional seminar ‚Ä¢ October 9, 2009: Conference on territorial attractiveness in the Mediterranean, within the Mediterranean Economic Week, Marseille (France).Attractiveness of Mediterranean Territories ‚Ä¢ November 23 & 24, 2009 : International conference on the Contribution of local and regional authorities to the Water Strategy of the Union for the Mediterranean, Lyon (France).Contribution of local and regional authorities to the Water Strategy of the Union for the Mediterranean ‚Ä¢ 29 November - 4 December 2010 : Mediterranean Economic Week, Marseille (France) References External links * Official website of the Mediterranean Commission * UCLG Official Website * Mediterranean Commission's prospects for 2011-2013 (FR) * Presentation booklet on the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG (FR) * First Global Report on Decentralisation and Local Democracy Category:International political organizations Category:Mediterranean ","title":"Mediterranean Interregional Commission"},{"id":"32553142","title":"Freaky Styley Tour"},{"id":"32553155","text":"Ernest Kilbourne. Ernest Albert Kilbourne (March 13, 1865 - April 13, 1928) was a missionary evangelist to Japan. He is best known for being a cofounder of the Oriental Missionary Society (now One Mission Society; formerly OMS International). Early life Ernest A. Kilbourne was born on March 13, 1865, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Two years after his birth, his family moved to the villages of Conestogo and Winterbourne in Ontario. His father established a general store, which contained a district telegraph and post office. The Kilbourne family attended a Methodist church. By the age of 14, Kilbourne was employed in a telegraphy job, and while still in his teens, he left Ontario to work with the Western Union in the United States. At the age of 21, Kilbourne was determined to become a writer and to see the world. He set out from New York on a trip around the world. He went to Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. Once back in the U.S., he began working as a telegraph operator in Virginia City, Nevada, where he met and fell in love with Julia Pittinger. A Roman Catholic girl, Pittinger had been born in Virginia City and was one of 17 children. They were married by the Reverend Laurence Ridgely of St. Paul‚Äôs Episcopal Church on June 30, 1888. After marrying, Kilbourne requested a transfer to the thriving city of Chicago, where he had hope of becoming a successful telegrapher. He was transferred and, in a short time, became divisional chief along with a man named Charles Cowman. Conversion One day, Cowman, who had recently become a passionate Christian, approached Kilbourne at work and evangelized to him for half of an hour. Kilbourne remained silent through Cowman‚Äôs message, and his lack of response led Cowman to believe he had failed in one of his first endeavors to share the Gospel. However, much to Charles‚Äô surprise, Ernest entered the workplace the following day and announced, \\"I went home last night after our conversation and did just what you told me. It is all settled and I gave myself to Christ,\\" (Page 20).Wood, Robert. \\"In These Mortal Hands: The Story of the Oriental Missionary Society. The First 50 Years.\\" OMS. 1983 Kilbourne joined the Grace Methodist Church and also began night classes at the Moody Bible Institute. He began to witness to friends and coworkers, and he and Cowman would even place tracts in mailboxes on their walks home from work. A pivotal moment for Kilbourne and Cowman occurred when the two men attended a missionary convention where they heard founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, A. B. Simpson, speak. Simpson‚Äôs message about missions gave the men the opportunity to have their minds and hearts opened to missionary work. Oriental Missionary Society In 1901, Charles and Lettie Cowman left for Japan to begin their work in overseas missions. Kilbourne was left in charge of the Telegraphers Mission Band, a group of Christian telegraphers that met together weekly to pray and study the Bible. They also gave a monthly offering to missions and sent Gospel tracts to other telegraphers around the world. Although Kilbourne wanted to join the Cowmans on their venture to Japan, he had unfinished business in the States. During and after working for a previous employer, Kilbourne had misused a free pass that had been given to him. After becoming a Christian, Kilbourne had vowed to pay the company back the money he had cheated them out of. Therefore, he remained in the U.S. in order to fulfill his promise. A year later, his debt had been repaid, and Kilbourne set out for Japan with his family, which now included Esther Lois, Ila and Edwin (Bud) Lawson. They arrived at the port of Yokohama in August 1902. Kilbourne had always been passionate for journalism, so after he arrived in Japan, he began a newsletter, Electric Messages, in November 1902 with the purpose of sharing reports of the work in Japan with telegraphers, friends and supporters back home. The magazine contained inspirational stories of God‚Äôs power and was filled with jargon that the telegraphers would be familiar with. In 1914, it was renamed The Oriental Missionary Society, after Jeremiah 50:2, which reads, \\"Declare ye among the nations and publish and set ye up a standard.\\" Charles and Lettie Cowman had arrived in Japan on February 22, 1901. There, they worked with Japanese preacher Juji Nakada and his wife, ministering to the Japanese. After converting to Christianity, Nakada wrote to Dwight L. Moody and asked if he could help him learn more about Christianity. Following Moody‚Äôs advice, Nakada traveled to the U.S. in 1897 and eventually met Cowman. Together Charles, Lettie and Juji worked together to begin ministering in Japan. On March 23, 1901, the first student appeared at the door of their newly founded Bible institute, and on April 2, they opened Central Gospel Mission. Students quickly filled the new school. So many students, in fact, that they outgrew the facility, and on October 31, 1904, they moved into a more spacious building. In less than six years, Cowman and Kilbourne reported having 12 branch missions and 22 Japanese pastors, wives and \\"Bible women.\\" Students spent two years at the Bible institute, a year in an interior station, and then came back to the institute for a sort of post-graduate work. Students were constantly out in the communities, evangelizing, preaching and handing out tracts. Within 30 years, more than 2,000 students had graduated from the Bible school, (Page 56). The Great Village Campaign Kilbourne, Cowman and Nakada, along with their wives, were reaching many Japanese with the message of Christ, and many of them had become Christians. However, the missionaries desired that all would hear. Although such a feat sounded unattainable, they began The Great Village Campaign of 1912‚Äì18. The goal of the campaign was to place Gospel literature into every one of the 10.3 million Japanese homes. Within the seven years of the campaign, their goal was reached. Kilbourne said, of handing out the Christian literature, \\"It is not an unusual thing for us to pass out 50,000 or more tracts in one afternoon‚Äôs work among the dense crowds gathered at some temple on a festival day in Tokyo, where hundreds of thousands of people are participating,\\" (Page 55).Erny, Edward and Ester. \\"No Guarantee But God: The Story of the Founders of OMS International.\\" OMS. 1969 Personality Although Kilbourne was a quiet man, he was passionate in his writing. Friend, Paul E. Haines recalled that Ernest‚Äôs \\"pen frequently seared deeply into the soul consciousness of many a faulty reaper, causing them [sic] to rise, shake the dust of indifference from their sluggish feet and hasten to the battlefront, an aroused soldier of the cross,\\" (Page 22). His words were powerful and effective, leading evangelist and educator, H.C. Morrison to say, \\"The writings of Ernest Kilbourne have stirred my soul more than any writings next to the Bible itself,\\" (Page 55). Korea Two Korean pastors came to the Tokyo Bible school and were so impressed with the school that more followed. Soon, Cowman and Kilbourne decided to begin evangelizing in Korea. They teamed up with Rev. John Thomas to start the venture. They established a training center in downtown Seoul. Launching a venture similar to the Great Village Campaign in Japan, they began an Every Creature Crusade in Korea, which resulted in three-fourths of the 30 million Koreans hearing the Gospel. The church in Korea has faced massive oppression, but has grown phenomenally, and is known today as \\"The miracle church.\\" In 1931, the church of Japan was supported entirely by its own people, and the OMS headquarters moved to Korea. China In 1907, Kilbourne and Cowman visited Shanghai, China, in order to attend a conference. Kilbourne recalled the importance of that conference, \\"That day in 1907, in a hotel in Shanghai, Brother Cowman and I were definitely called to that field. Although years of inaction passed, that vision ever held and never dimmed; contrariwise, it brightened,\\" (Page 58). Kilbourne finally brought their vision to fruition 18 years later, one year after Cowman died. Kilbourne and a team of missionaries arrived in China in 1925, which appeared to be a very inopportune time. The country was in the midst of a civil uprising and missionaries were fleeing the country. In No Guarantee but God, Edward and Esther Erny show the way in which Kilbourne and his team were regarded by the fleeing missionaries. \\"A veteran missionary, speaking to some 20 Christian workers who were housed temporarily in a YMCA washroom, expressed what many were thinking. ‚ÄòThe Oriental Missionary Society starting a work in China at a time like this?‚Äô he exclaimed. ‚ÄòYou must be fools.‚Äô Ironically, it was this same missionary whose home was rented by the OMS, making it the first headquarters for the work in China,\\" (Page 59). The tumultuous atmosphere in China left many eager to hear the Gospel. While in China, Kilbourne met Andrew Gih, whom he taught about a victorious life in the spirit. He also witnessed his conversion to Christ. Gih went on to become one of the most effective evangelists to ever come from Asia. Death Kilbourne continued to do the work of God, until he died on April 13, 1928, at the age of 63, of a cerebral hemorrhage. More than 2,000 people attended a memorial service in Japan upon hearing the news of his death. Kilbourne‚Äôs legacy lives on in the work of OMS today. Kilbourne lived his life by these words, \\"Every soul it is my joy to lead to Christ, I see as a potential Christian worker. I pray and labor for them until I see God‚Äôs full will accomplished in their lives,\\" (Page 53).

A Scottish army observed the landing on 3 May 1544 but did not engage with the English force. The Provost of Edinburgh was compelled to allow the English to sack Leith and Edinburgh, and the city was burnt on 7 May. However, the Scottish artillery within Edinburgh Castle harassed the English forces, who had neither the time nor the resources to besiege the Castle. The English fleet sailed away loaded with captured goods, and with two ships that had belonged to James V of Scotland. The plan Henry VIII Henry VIII of England wished to unite the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England, or at least bring the kingdom under his hegemony. He had contracted with the Regent Arran that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry his son, Prince Edward. But Arran allowed the Parliament of Scotland to revoke this agreement prompting Henry to declare war in December 1543, and now the Regent was making ground against his rebels who still supported the English marriage, such as the Earl of Lennox, Earl of Glencairn, the Earl of Cassillis, and the Earl of Angus. These nobles were in touch with Henry VIII via Lennox's secretary Thomas Bishop and Angus's chaplain, Master John Penven. Their letters to Henry VIII requested intervention, and in March he replied that a 'main army' was in preparation.HMC, Marquis of Salisbury, Hatfield House, vol. 1 (London, 1883), nos. 101, 133, 134, 135: Haynes (1740), pp. 19, 20: Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (1903), preface, identifies Penven as Angus's chaplain. Henry's Privy Council issued his instructions for the invasion force on 10 April 1544, and they were to: > Put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh, so razed and defaced when you > have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a > perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon [them] for their > falsehood and disloyalty.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, > 2000), 144: Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 326 Letters & > Papers, vol. 19 part 1, no. 314. Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, at this time called Lord Hertford was the King's Lieutenant of this Army Royal. He had considered establishing an English garrison at Leith, within walls made of timber topped with turf, and fortifying Inchkeith but the Privy Council vetoed this plan.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 330‚Äì1, 338‚Äì341 Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy St Andrews, but Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome. Hertford Hertford discussed with Privy Council the possibility of Scottish allies capturing Cardinal Beaton during his invasion. Henry believed that Beaton, a favourer of the Auld Alliance with France, was particularly responsible for the rejection of the marriage plan. Beaton's would-be kidnappers included James Kirkcaldy of Grange, Norman Leslie Master of Rothes, and John Charteris who offered to attempt to capture the Cardinal as he travelled in Fife. Their second scheme was to attack Arbroath while attention was focused on Edinburgh. This offer was made by Alexander Crichton of Brunstane who sent a messenger called Wishart to Hertford.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV cont., (London, 1836), 377. Time was too short to offer military support for these plans, but if those concerned would join in the destruction of Church property they would be offered asylum in England and ¬£1000 to fund their action.HMC Salisbury, Hatfield, vol. 1 (London, 1883), p. 36 no. 36: Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, vol. 1 (London, 1740), p. 32: the Scottish agent conducting this negotiation in London was called 'Wishart'. Any schemes more elaborate than a punitive raid on Edinburgh were shelved as Henry committed resources to the siege of Boulogne in France already planned for the summer. Supplies The army assembled at Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. In April 1544, Sir Christopher Morris reported to Lord Hertford that he had organised munitions for the invasion at Berwick-upon-Tweed. These included: * 2 batard culverins * 3 sakers * 8 falcons * a falconette * 4 carriages with two 'bases' on each * 3000 bows, 1000 ready strung in 60 chests * 4000 sheaves of arrows in 80 chests * 4 barrels of bow strings; described further as 40 gross of 12 dozen, i.e., 5,760 strings * 480 Moorish pikes * 3000 bills Anthony Neville of South Leverton was appointed Surveyor General of Victuals for the army.Bindoff, Stanley T., et al ed., The House of Commons: 1509‚Äì1558, part 1, Appendices, constituencies, members A‚ÄìC, vol. 4 (1982), p. 6 Edward Shelley (who was one of the first English soldiers to be killed at the battle of Pinkie) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to ask permission to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock.HMC: Report on the Manuscripts of the Most Honourable the Marquess of Bath, at Longleat, Seymour Papers, vol. 4 (1967), pp. 60‚Äì63. 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on Haddington. Their commander Ralph Eure wrote from Alnwick on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money.HMC, Seymour Papers, vol. 4 (1967),pp. 64‚Äì5 He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that they could come to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (1903), nos. 464, 467. Orders for the fleet The carrack Pauncy from the Anthony Roll Orders for the fleet at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships were to be ready to weigh anchor at a favourable wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the Rose Lion with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (1892), pp. 354‚Äì356. The ships were, for the vanguard or forward; the Pauncy, Minion, Swallow, Gabian of Ipswich, John Evangelist, Galley Subtle, with the barque of Calais. For the battle; the Sweepstake, Swan of Hamburgh, Mary Grace, and the Elizabeth of Lynn. For the rear-ward; the Great Galley, Gillian of Dartmouth, Peter of Foy, Anthony Fulford, and the Barque Riveley.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 354 Defence On 23 April 1544, all Scottish east coast towns were warned to entrench their bounds to resist the English navy. Men from neighbouring counties were summoned to muster in Edinburgh on 5 May. Extra gunners were hired for Edinburgh Castle, and Regent Arran's goods and the royal tapestries were carried up the Royal Mile from Holyroodhouse to the Castle and watched by his wardrobe servant Malcolm Gourlay. In the previous month an Edinburgh merchant James Johnston of Coates was paid ¬£22 for going to \\"find out the Englishmen's purpose.\\"Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.8, HM General Register House (1908) lv‚Äìlix, pp. 276, 289‚Äì291.

A later account by Mary's secretary Claude Nau records the fleet burning St Mynettes on the north side of the Forth and taking fishing boats for landing-craft.Stevenson, Joseph ed., The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau, Edinburgh, (1883), 318, 338‚Äì9 John Knox gave an account of the landing from another Scottish viewpoint. The English fleet was sighted before noon on Saturday 3 May. Knox said that Cardinal Beaton dismissed the threat and sat calmly at dinner. At 6 pm there were 200 ships and an English pilot sounded the depths between Granton and Leith. Though experts could see this meant the English minded to land still there was no Scottish response. At daybreak on Sunday some of the smaller boats nosed onto land at Granton Crags and the troops landed using these as piers for the larger boats. According to Knox, when around 10,000 men were landed unchallenged the Cardinal and Regent Arran left Edinburgh.David Laing, History of the Reformation, Works of John Knox, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 119‚Äì120: Claude Nau wrote \\"Wendy\\" meaning \\"Wardie\\" east of Granton. St Ninian's Chapel at the Bridgend was burnt in May 1544. The attached manse still stands. The English account is similar, but mentions the presence of five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan).Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (1908), no. 481, Lisle to Paget. The Earls of Huntly and Moray also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half-hour fight, \\"right sharply handled on both parts\\", with Peter Mewtas's hagbuters giving good service.Letters & Papers, vol.19 part 1 (1908), no.472. The Admiral reported that Beaton stayed until he was in range of the handguns. He was wearing a frock of yellow velvet, cut and pulled out with white tinselled sarcenet.Calendar of State Papers, Spain, vol. 7, (1899), no .86, Admiral to Paget, 8 May 1544: the description of the Cardinal's costume was translated into French; \\"Le cardinal y estoit en ung beau chamar de velour iausne tout coupp√© et deschiquett√© bien soigneusement comme √† ung tel prelat appartient.\\", no. 88 & note. Another stand before Leith itself gave some resistance, but folded after three expert Scottish gunners were killed by arrows. Hertford summoned Eure and the border horsemen with a brief note mentioning the lack of resistance, signed from the field on the west of Leith.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.464. The English then entered Leith unopposed, where they found two ships that had belonged to James V, the Salamander of Leith and the Unicorn. Some buildings in Leith were burnt, including St Ninian's chapel at the Bridge-end.'Calendar of Charters & other writs', PSAS (1907), p.327 no.39. Their overnight security was increased by recently constructed defensive entrenchments. Next day, Monday 5 May, the larger English ships were able to unload the heavier artillery on the quayside of the Shore of Leith. These guns were to be used against Edinburgh's gates and the castle.Tudor Tracts, (1903),40‚Äì41. Cardinal Beaton left the area on Monday, the date recorded in his accounts for hiring a guide between Corstorphine and Stirling, (a journey then more usually made by boat).Rentale Sancti Andree, SHS (1913), p. 180 According to Eustace Chapuys, on the same day the Cardinal's enemy Alexander Crichton of Brunstane tried to meet Hertford at Leith, but an English guard shot him with an arrow in the leg. However, Hertford wrote that Brunstane was in the field with Arran and retreated with him to Linlithgow.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.7 (1899), no.95. The Earl of Angus, George Douglas of Pittendreich and Lord Maxwell were in prison at Blackness Castle and Edinburgh Castle because they supported the English alliance. Arran, Guise, and the Cardinal now ordered their release so their supporters would help their cause. Maxwell later wrote that they were offered cash inducements, with incomes from church lands and pensions from the King of France.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 (1836), pp. 428‚Äì229, the Confession of Lord Maxwell. Edinburgh Detail of Richard Lee's sketch showing the Palace of Holyroodhouse, English troops entering the Canongate and an English position on Calton Hill William Stourton (later commander of the Newhaven fort at Ambleteuse) was left in charge of Leith on 6 May with 1,500 men while the main force approached Edinburgh itself. They were met by the Provost Adam Otterburn and two heralds. Otterburn offered to give up the keys of the town on conditions. Hertford refused to accept as he had no authority to bargain. Another English herald went to the Castle, and returned with the news that the Earl of Huntly and Lord Home had brought 2000 horsemen to defend the town. Sir Christopher Morris was then ordered to bring his artillery up the Canongate to assault Edinburgh's Netherbow Gate. During this operation some of the English gunners were killed. The infantry attacked the gate and, according to the English narrative, pulled one of the Scottish artillery pieces through its gunloop. The Scots could not retaliate due to heavy small arms fire and archery, during which Morris placed a cannon close to the gate. After three or four rounds, the gate was breached and the English army stormed through killing 300 or 400 defenders. The Scottish exchequer accounts record that their heavy guns were withdrawn from the High Street into the Castle.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1908), p. 291. At this point, according to a report sent to Charles V, the English troops who were unused to urban warfare fought amongst each other, and William Howard, brother of the Duke of Norfolk, was hurt in the cheek by an English arrow.Calendar of State Papers, Spain, vol. 7 (London, 1899), no. 89, French copy of Imperial newsletter. On the Royal Mile, the central main street of Edinburgh, the English were exposed to the artillery of the Castle. They attempted to place their cannon above the Butter-Tron, between Lawnmarket and Castlehill. A shot from the Castle dismounted one English cannon, and Hertford ordered it to be deliberately burst. At the end of that day, the English retired from the town to their camp at Leith after starting a number of fires. On 7 May, the fire-raising and looting continued, in the town and at Holyrood, and the English force was joined by Ralph Eure's 4000 border horsemen. Lord Hertford and his companions wrote that they watched Edinburgh burn from a hill beside the town and could hear \\"women and poor miserable creatures\\" crying out and blaming the Cardinal.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 369. Nicholas Poyntz was sent to burn Kinghorn and villages on the north of the river Forth. The fortress on the island of Inchgarvie was captured and destroyed by Richard Brooke in the Galley Subtile on 6 May. Hertford had mentioned in his dispatch that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it.'Late Expedition in Scotland, 1544', in Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), 44: Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (London, 1908), no. 472. Christopher Morris shipped the larger artillery, the ships sailed, and on 14 May the harbour and piers of Leith were demolished. Hertford, as the King's Lieutenant, knighted fifty-eight of his captains and his servant Thomas Fisher distributed three pounds and fifteen shillings amongst the men.HMC Marquis of Bath, Longleat, Seymour Papers, vol. 4 (1967), p. 73.

The Clerk of the King's Works, Richard Lee, who was Captain of the Pioneers on this expedition and the Surveyor of Calais, William Burgate, declared the castle impregnable.History of the King's Works, vol. 3, HMSO (1975), 357: Letters & Papers, vol.19, 327, 468, 483‚Äì4: Hamilton Papers, vol.2 (1892), p. 356 One of the Castle gunners was Andrew Mansioun, a French carver who had made fittings for the Unicorn, the yacht of James V and furniture for the royal palaces.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture vol. XXXII (2018), pp. 127‚Äì136. His hand was injured when a cannon backfired, and in June 1544 he was given 44 shillings to pay for treatment.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (1908), 127, 143, 299. Repairs were made in July 1544, when two of the gunners, Tibault Roqueneau and Piers Schouffene (French or Flemish, originally employed at Dunbar Castle) were working to improve the gun emplacements with gabions. The fore-wall of the castle was strengthened and repaired from July. This work was completed between July and August 1546 by three masons and four workmen (called barrowmen in the accounts).Accounts of the Lord High treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (1908), pp. 304, 305, 474. Looting Hertford estimated the value of goods in Leith at ¬£10,000. This included a large stock of three grades of linen cloth from Brittany. The ships were loaded with property seized in Edinburgh and Leith. He also took the Salamander and Unicorn, loading them with 80,000 cannon balls for ballast from the King's Wark arsenal.Tudor Tracts, (1903), 44: Hamilton Papers, vol.2 (1892), p.378 no.238, \\"canvas, polldavies (Pouldavid linen), olromes, other linen cloths,\\" perhaps sail- cloth. One surviving captured item is the Dunkeld Lectern, removed from Holyrood Abbey before the English soldiers fired the church. The lectern may have come into the possession of Sir Richard Lee who made plans of Edinburgh and Leith and assessed the strength of Edinburgh Castle. Lee certainly took a brass font from Holyrood which he gave to St Albans Abbey. He had it engraved with an inscription claiming that it was used for the baptism of the Kings of Scotland. As a relic of the monarchy it was destroyed during the English civil war. Longleat House has a manuscript copy of a translation of Hector Boece's Chronicle of Scotland, taken by John Thynne, Hertford's steward, from Holyroodhouse on Wednesday 7 May 1544.Chambers & Seton, 'Bellenden's translation of Boece' in SHR, vol. 9, no.75 (April 1922), p.198: Longleat's Libraries Christie's Some of Hertford's muster lists survive at Longleat. These include the name of Sir William Norris of Liverpool.HMC, Manuscripts of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat, Seymour Papers, vol.4, HMSO (1967), 70. It has traditionally been asserted that carved panelling at his house of Speke Hall came from the Palace of Holyroodhouse though this has been challenged on stylistic grounds.Whatton, William Robert, 'An Inquiry into the probability of a Tradition connected with the Library and Furniture of James IV of Scotland, and of their having been carried off after the Battle of Flodden, and set up at Speke Hall, in the county of Lancaster', Archaeologia Scotia, vol.4, (1857), pp. 1‚Äì14 (no knowledge of the Longleat muster) At Speke there were legal books including Bartolus sup. primi degestis veteris, Venice (1499) and Panormitanus on the Decretals, Lyon (1501), with Robert Estienne's Bible (1532). William Norris wrote in each volume that they were won at Edinburgh on 8 May 1544. The books passed to the library of the Liverpool Athenaeum in the 19th century.Pidgeon, H.

Although Edinburgh was not again threatened by the war, rebuilding was a slow process. New buildings were built on the exact site of their predecessors. Tenure of the Edinburgh lands was complex with numbers of owners claiming incomes from sub-divided buildings, with some portions 'mortified' to the chaplains of altars. At the end of the war, in September 1551 and February 1552 Parliament laid down guidelines for sharing the burden of costs for re-building the burnt lands and tenements \\"brint be the auld inimies of Ingland.\\"Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 3 (1814), pp. 489‚Äì491.

The case concerned an intellectual property dispute over the production of Lucasfilm's Stormtrooper costumes by model maker Andrew Ainsworth. Mr Ainsworth argued that the helmets, which he continues to manufacture and sell, were functional props covered only by design right legislation, as opposed to Lucasfilm's assertion that they were sculptures or art which fall under copyright law. Design right protection is retained for 15 or 10 years, copyright protection can last considerably longer.  Case background  The Stormtrooper character first appeared in the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The character was conceived by George Lucas, designed by artist Ralph McQuarrie, sculpted by from Liz Moore and Brian Muir, and finally molded from the existing designs by Andrew Ainsworth. Before the case came to court, Ainsworth had sold replica Stormtrooper outfits online for many years causing Lucasfilm to sue for infringement of copyright. Ainsworth did not defend the 2006 case in the US courts and defaulted. Accordingly, the United States District Court for the Central District of California gave summary judgement in favour of Lucasfilm, awarding a USD $20 million compensation. In the English courts, Lucasfilm was represented by Michael Bloch QC and Jonathan Sumption QC.  Court ruling  The Supreme Court ruled that the Stormtrooper helmets could not be considered a sculpture for the purposes of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. On the issue of the justiciability of a foreign copyright claim, the court ruled that providing that there is in personam jurisdiction over a defendant, an English court does have jurisdiction in this area. On this point, the case was distinguished from British South Africa v Companhia de Mocambique,British South Africa Co v Companhia de Mo√ßambique [1893] 602, House of Lords, (England and Wales). that expressed the general principle that English courts have no jurisdiction to entertain an action to determine title, where claims applied to foreign intellectual property rights.

National and international approaches include the Beyond GDP programme developed by the European Union, the Better Lives Compendium of Indicators developed by the OECD, as well as many alternative metrics of wellbeing or happiness. One of the earliest attempts to develop such an index at national level was Bhutan's Gross National Happiness Index and there are a now a number of similar projects ongoing around the world, including a project to develop for the UK an assessment of national well- being, commissioned by the Prime Minister David Cameron and led by the Office for National Statistics.  GNH  The GNH phrase was initially used as an off-hand remark by the King of Bhutan to indicate his lack of interest in western materialistic style of economic development. The implementation of the GNH philosophy was meant to prohibit TV and Jeans from becoming part of the culture of the Bhutanese population. Despite modernization of the GNH concept by Karma Ura, Up to date the GNH is seen by some to hide some values that are in contradiction to western lifestyle. In 2005, a US based think tank, the International Institute of Management, published a working paper followed by a policy white paper in 2006 calling for the implementation of GNH philosophy in the United States. The papers called for a secular and more scientific implementation of a public policy framework and econometric measurement tool also known as Gross National Well-being or GNW and launched the first secular global gross national happiness index survey. Despite, the differences in the visions, both papers credited the King of Bhutan for the inspiration. The American GNH framework and GNH Index Survey was referenced by various researchers and policy makers as an answer to the failures of unchecked capitalism and hyper-focus on GDP. Among the prominent proposals was a report to US congress, UK Prime Minister Office, and Government of Goa. Later happiness and well-being development frameworks were similar to the proposal. For example the Bhutan GNH Index published in 2012 after 2 years of research was not dissimilar from the first secular GNH framework and Index of 2005. The main difference was the addition of spiritual elements such as Karma and prayers indicators to fit the local Bhutanese culture. The Bhutan GNH philosophy was initially dismissed due to its generality and was considered as touchy-feely concept, but later taken seriously after it published an econometric framework.  Beyond GDP In 2007, the European Commission, the European Parliament, Club of Rome, OECD and WWF hosted a conference titled \\"Beyond GDP\\". The consensus was to widen measures of economic growth and come up with measures that can inform policy making. The conference was attended by over 650 policy makers, experts and social activists. Spurred by its success the European Union released a communication titled GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens: * Complementing GDP with highly aggregated environmental and social indicators * Near real-time information for decision-making * More accurate reporting on distribution and inequalities * Developing a European sustainable development scoreboard * Extending national accounts to environmental and social issues. Following this communication and its adoption by the European Parliament in June 2008, many European governments and policy makers have started work on developing new measures of economic development. In August 2013, the European Commission published the Staff Working Document on \\"Progress on 'GDP and beyond' actions\\" , in which reviews what had been achieved on the five steps identified in the communication GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world. Some of the most significant actions taken include: * The European Statistical System adopted the first set of indicators on 'quality of life and well-being' and it also decided for the EU- SILC (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) to be the core instrument for building up such indicators. * The time taken to publish key environmental indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions has been shortened by as much as eight months by using advanced statistical methods to arrive at so-called 'early estimates', which have proven to be sufficiently accurate to inform policy decisions. Since 2012, Eurostat has produced 'early estimates'‚Äîwithin four months‚Äîfor CO2 emissions from energy use. * A consensus has not been reached on the EU Sustainable Development Scoreboard. However, a preliminary scoreboard of resource efficiency indicators (REI) is currently being tested and discussed. * The EU actively supported the finalisation and adoption by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) of the System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) as the international statistical standard. * Since 2010, European statistics have been published on 'annual adjusted disposable income in purchasing power standards' and the quarterly 'real disposable income of households'. * Summary indices on poverty and human development have been calculated for all 277 European regions. In addition, the European Commission provides a list of different indicators that can be categorised into five categories : * GDP and other macro-economic indicators - provided by the System of National Accounts (SNA). * Enlarged GDP measures - include costs such as expense of environmental degradation, resource depletion or higher income inequality. They provide a more accurate indication of a country's actual economic, environmental and social performance. * Social indicators ‚Äì combine several aspects of social progress. * Environmental indicators ‚Äì relate to the environmental development and linked issues such as human health. * Well-being ‚Äì include both subjective and objective measures to report on quality of life and life satisfaction. Measuring national well- being in the UK In 2010 the Measuring National Well-being programme was launched in the UK. It is led by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and its aim is to develop accepted and trusted measures of the well-being of the nation. Following a national debate in 2011 asking ‚Äúwhat matters‚Äù to the general public, the programme has published a series of releases on experimental methodology such as the value of the non-market production of households collected in the Household Satellite Accounts and ad-hoc analysis like the Commuting and Personal Well-being release. It has also established a series of periodic publications. For example, the Human Capital estimates and the Life in the UK report are published annually. The Life in the UK report was first published in November 2012 and included the National Well-being Wheel of measures, which is being updated twice a year, with the May 2014 update being the latest. The wheel includes headline indicators in areas such as health, relationships, job satisfaction, economic security, education, environmental conditions and measures of 'personal well-being' (individuals' assessment of their own well-being). A Summary of National Well-being Measures from March 2014 National Well-being Wheel of measures The programme will continue developing and improving the measurement of the well-being of the citizens in the United Kingdom in order to report on the findings to inform both public debate and policy-making. World Bank The World Bank suggests the usage of Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gross National Happiness Index (NHI). The HDI is a composite index of # life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity, # knowledge and education as measured by the adult literacy rate and functions of school enrollment rate and # standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of GDP, adjusted to purchasing power parity. The NHI focuses on the spiritual and material development of human beings by focussing on the four pillars of sustainable development, preservation of cultural values, conservation of natural resources and establishment of good governance. The bank also notes suggestions made by President Nicholas Sarkozy for the modification of the definition of GDP that stops the social and cultural damage that the current definitions are leading to. The Bank also suggests Adjusted Net Savings as an alternative to GDP.  Suggested measures  Some other measures that have been suggested as a replacement of GDP are Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare ( ISEW) as suggested by Friends of the Earth, Environmentally Sustainable National Income ( eSNI) by Dr. Hueting, See also * Bhutan GNH Index * Disability-adjusted life year * Economics * Green national product * Gender Development Index * Genuine progress indicator * Green gross domestic product * Gross National Happiness * Gross National Well-being * Happiness economics * Happy Planet Index * Human Development Index * Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare * Progress (history) * Progressive utilization theory * Legatum Prosperity Index * Leisure satisfaction * Money-rich, time- poor * OECD Better Life Index * Post-materialism * Psychometrics * Subjective life satisfaction * Where-to-be-born Index * Wikiprogress * World Happiness Report * World Values Survey  References   External links  ;Institutions *European Union. *OECD. *Office for National Statistics (UK) ;Academic *London School of Economics. *Open University. *Oxford University (Health Economics) Category:Economic growth ","title":"Broad measures of economic progress"},{"id":"32553235","text":"Peter Knobler (born 1946) is an American writer living in New York City.

The \\"show\\" is filmed by robotic flying cameras that accompany the Agents of the Supreme Military Agency of Super Humans (S.M.A.S.H.) everywhere they go, resulting in humorous vignettes and visual gags throughout each episode. Hulk, She-Hulk, Red Hulk, A-Bomb, and Skaar come together as the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. to tackle threats that no other superheroes can face. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. have their base near the town of Vista Verde (where Bruce Banner first became Hulk) and often face various threats with a recurring one being from Hulk's archenemy Leader (who holds the key to Skaar's origin). In Season Two, upon their return to Earth following their fights with the Kree and the Skrull, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. are hunted by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the military (which now have Hulkbuster technology) following the incident caused by the Leader's Agents of C.R.A.S.H. After proving their innocence, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. will later have to deal the Leader traveling back in time to alter history, followed by an invasion led by the Supreme Intelligence and the Kree Armada in the wake of the incarceration of Ronan the Accuser.

Romick and two of his colleagues employed by Goodyear Aerospace, a subsidiary of the American Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Darrell Romick originally estimated that the craft would cost about the same as an intercontinental B-52 bomber. Concept The concept was introduced in 1954, before the dawn of human spaceflight, to be displayed at the annual conference of the American Rocket Society. The design called for a winged spacecraft piloted by a crew of three. The craft was to contain three stages, of which only the uppermost, containing the crew, would ultimately be propelled to orbit around Earth. Each of these three stages was to contain landing gear and a crew of its own, allowing the stages to be piloted to a landing to be reused in a future launch. For reentry and landing, the nose of each stage had a mechanism that would allow the nose to close into a point. The craft would have been long, and would weigh 500 tons. The craft itself would have been impractically massive for the time period; however, the design ignited public interest in that it was an early concept for a reusable vehicle to transport crew and cargo to space and back, and was the subject of an article in the December 1957 issue of Popular Science magazine. The original concept envisioned the craft launching from the White Sands Missile Range. At a downrange distance of and an altitude of , the first stage would separate from the craft. At downrange, the second stage would separate at an altitude of . After launch was completed, the third stage/crew compartment would orbit the Earth at an altitude of at a velocity of , where it would stay for approximately two months before returning to Earth.

After the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority ordered the demolition of the Category II heritage building registered by Heritage New Zealand, it was the first court challenge of CERA's post-earthquake powers. In July 2011, the High Court decided in the authority's favour and the building was demolished the following day. History Matthew Frank Barnett (1859‚Äì1935) was a successful bookmaker from Christchurch. He ran his betting business with his friend Peter Grant. Wharetiki House in May 2011 In July 1901, Barnett bought two adjoining parcels of land (Lot 3 & 4, Deposited Plan 1147) from Henry Layton Bowker. The overall property was roughly square and fronted onto Colombo and Salisbury Streets, a location in the north of the Christchurch Central City. According to records held by the valuation department, construction of the house started in 1902. The house was built on Lot 3 of the property (the northern section), and Lot 4, facing Salisbury Street, had a garage and a bowling green. Construction was completed in 1904. The house was connected to the city drains in April 1904, but it was not until 1923 that electricity was supplied to the building. Water came initially from an artesian well on the property. It is not known with certainty who the architect was, but evidence points towards Robert England (1863‚Äì1908). At the time, architectural pattern books were common, but the Wharetiki design has not been found. England, on the other hand, has designed houses of similar style, most importantly for Barnett's friend and business partner Grant, who in about 1906 had Westhaven Eventide Home built at 901 Colombo Street, i.e. in the immediate neighbourhood. Closer to Art Nouveau in style than the Arts and Craft style of Wharetiki, it nevertheless had the same style turret incorporated into the design. The Barnett family ‚Äì standing from left: Tui, Olly, Ethel ‚Äì sitting from left: Alice May (Topsy), Ivy, Mary (n√©e Whelan), Matthew, Kate Wharetiki was a large and representative dwelling, displaying the wealth of its owner. Barnett was married to Mary (n√©e Whelan) and they had six children, born between 1889 and 1903. The house had several servants and Mary Barnett's unmarried younger sister Maria (known as Polly) was in charge of them. The house had a total floor area of , which made for comfortable living. Mary Barnett's father died in 1908 and her mother Margaret, together with her second youngest son Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki, too. Margaret Whelan lived there for the rest of her life and she died at Wharetiki in 1926. Mary Barnett fell ill in 1930 and was confined to a wheel chair. The back stairs of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, so that she could move around the house. Mary Barnett died on 1 March 1931 at Wharetiki, aged 66. Matthew Barnett died on 28 January 1935, aged 75, also at Wharetiki. He was buried next to his wife the following day. Other owners After Barnett's death, the house was inherited by three family members: his brother Arthur, his oldest son Olly Barnett, and his wife's sister Maria (Polly) Whelan. They immediately employed auctioneer H. G. Livinstone & Co to sell the property and all furnishings, with the date for auction set as 14 May 1935. It was sold to the widow Margaret Isabella Marshall, who appears not to have lived in the building herself. She onsold the house in 1942 to Ernest Archbold, who in turn sold the building to Robert Heaton Livingstone in the following year. Probably under Archbold's ownership, the house was used by the Glenfell sisters (Jean, Reynolda and Ellen) as a boarding house for pupils from Christchurch Girls' High School, who at the time used a building later known as the Cranmer Centre as their school. The connection with the girls school lasted for four years. The building became known as Glenfell House during that time. The ownership of the property kept changing. From Livinstone, the property passed to the Public Trustee in 1957, who onsold to the Staffordshire Finance Company in 1964. It is likely that at that point, the Glenfell connection with the house finished. The house change owners again in 1973, when Peter John Diver and David Stephen Diver took over. They sold the property to Sunset Properties. The owner of that company (Mr Merrett) was a son of the owner of the Staffordshire Finance Company. There was a brief period in the 1980s when the house was operated as Grenville Guesthouse, but for the remaining time, it was a boarding house. In 1995, the property was purchased by Chesterfield Preschools Ltd, who operated a pre- school on the ground floor. The owner of that company is David Hampton, who is still the current owner of the property. Wharetiki house in 2006 2010 and 2011 earthquakes Wharetiki after demolition, with only the turret sitting in the garden The building suffered some damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, and severe damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. According to the owner, it was not further damaged in the June 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) assessed the building several times and eventually ordered its demolition, with the building included on the demolition list in early April. The demolition order was challenged by the owner, who took the case to the High Court. It was the first time that CERA's power to order the demolition of a building had been challenged in the courts. Justice Whata dismissed the challenge on 20 June 2011, and the building was demolished the following day.

Biography John Alfred Valentine Butler (known to his friends and colleagues as J. A. V.) was born into a Cotswolds farming family in Winchcombe on 14 February 1899; he was the eldest of three children of Alfred and Mary Ann (n√©e Powell). After attending the local primary school he won a scholarship which covered the travelling expenses and fees for Cheltenham Grammar School. Coming from a non-academic family he had no encouragement to go to university, and so took a short apprenticeship with a local pharmacist. This led to his being drafted into the RAMC towards the end of World War I: after training, he was posted to a field hospital near Ypres. Here, he had the chance for self study, with the help of books on loan from Lewis's Lending Library in London, and the University Correspondence College, Cambridge. Butler was demobilised in October 1919 and enrolled at University of Birmingham, from where he graduated ‚ÄúBSc with 1st Class Honours in 1921 (1st in the year).‚Äù In 1922 he was appointed Assistant Lecturer in the University College of Swansea. His work here resulted in the later publication of his first two books (see Works). Butler‚Äôs next appointment was in 1926 as Lecturer in Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh, under Sir James Walker, where he studied the behaviour of electrolytes in mixed solvents, on which he published a series of papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (A) with five different collaborators from 1929-1933. A wide range of other papers appeared during this productive phase. Productive but not financially rewarding: he found it difficult to support his family on his Lecturer‚Äôs stipend. In 1939 he was appointed to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, Princeton and so at the end of August the family sailed on the Queen Mary to New York. Butler worked in J H Northrop‚Äôs group on the homogeneity of crystallised enzymes. After the outbreak of WWII, Butler offered his services and was appointed Executive Officer at the British Central Scientific Office in Washington, DC, which had a staff of 17 officers, under the direction of Sir Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin. He continued in that role until 1944, when Edinburgh asked him to return to teaching there. But he did not find the conditions ‚Äúat all congenial‚Äù, and so he secured an appointment in 1946 at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry under Professor (later Sir) Charles Dodds, where he worked on the proteolytic degradation of insulin. This work was not altogether successful, in part because of the great strides made by Sanger. So, in 1949, Butler moved to the Chester Beatty Research Institute in Chelsea, directed by Alexander Haddow. There were two main themes to his work at the Chester Beatty, one of which ‚Äì on the proteins associated with DNA in the structure of chromosomes, the histones ‚Äì is especially associated with Butler. Family In 1929 Butler married Margaret Lois Hope, a botanist and Cambridge graduate, at Haddington, East Lothian. They had three children, all successful in their respective fields of biological and medical sciences. From 1949 to 1977 the Butler‚Äôs lived in Rickmansworth in a house then known as Nightingale Corner, which had previously belonged to Hubert J. Foss, first Musical Editor (1923‚Äì1941) for Oxford University Press. Like the Fosses, the Butlers often entertained guests there. J. A.

Medical career  Following the national banking Panic of 1873, Mr. Keck's foundry business collapsed and the couple began to collect herbs and brew her remedies together, which Rebecca Keck started to sell door to door.Dr. James Frederic Clarke M.D. ibid page 29 Seeking a wider market, in November, 1873, she took out her first advertisement for \\"Keck's Catarrhochesis\\" in Dubuque.Dubuque Herald November 23 to 29, 1873 Success came very quickly; within three years she was advertising her \\"Catarrh Cure\\" heavily in a number of newspapers including the Dubuque Herald, the Davenport Gazette and the Chicago Times and Chicago Tribune. Besides selling her remedies by mail order, she practiced as an \\"itinerant physician,\\" a common business model for the frontier, because sick people were scattered across long distances and lacked regular access to medical care. She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week. The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894. Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to Davenport, Iowa, on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.Finger's Davenport Business Directory for 1876 As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr & Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order. Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical libraryRebecca J. Keck's last will and testament p. 4 and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The Eclectic School of medicine, which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with homeopathy and allopathic (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases. There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician. Fame grows  With the exception of Lydia Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling patent medicine in 19th century America.Sarah Stage, Female Complaints: Lydia Pinkham and the Business of Women's Medicine W.W. Norton & Co. 1979. Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations. It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,Davenport Gazette June 2, 1879, p.2 and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.The Insurance Press May 17, 1905 While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced. Some newspapers ran her illustrated, full-column ads on the front page under the heading, \\"Mrs. Dr. Keck's Column.\\" The Decatur ReviewAbout Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois) declared on November 15, 1883, \\"We have a marked example among us of success in medicine, in the person of Mrs. Dr. Keck, well-known in the West,\\" while the Bloomington Pantagraph declared on August 30, 1883 that Mrs. Dr. Keck \\"absorbs considerable public attention and is a subject for congratulation among the women of America‚Ä¶a forcible illustration of the ability of women to succeed\\" in \\"avenues of professional or public life.\\" The Quincy Whig said she was \\"one of our longest established and best known physicians,\\"The Quincy Whig July 21, 1881 page 5 while the Evening Peorian referred to her \\"celebrity as a physician and good name as a citizen.\\"Bloomington Daily Leader September 24, 1881 page 2 The Peoria National Democrat declared, \\"her success is unprecedented‚Ä¶she is capable of doing the work of five ordinary women.\\" The regular medical establishment disagreed. The secretary of the Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John Rauch was quoted in the Chicago Tribune as saying that Mrs. Dr. Keck was \\"foul and damnable in every way,\\"Chicago Daily Tribune February 7, 1880, p. 15 and mostly male members of county medical associations were hardly less kind; Dr. James Clarke M.D. of Fairfield averred that the sale of her catarrh cures \\"made the doctor wealthy, even if it did not cure her patients.\\" Regular doctors universally dismissed her as a quack, and her name was excluded from the physicians and surgeons listing in the Davenport business directories every year after 1878, although she continued to describe herself as a specialist and physician in the regular alphabetical listings and bought the entire back cover of the 1882 edition to advertise her infirmary.  Legal reform  The state of Illinois passed its Medical Practices Act in 1877 in an effort to exert some control of the wholly unregulated medical profession in the state.Clinton Sandvick, Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877-1890 Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine June 2009; 82(2): 67‚Äì74 This Illinois law was a landmark in health law in the United States, leading the way towards improved standards for the dismal state of medical licensing and medical education in the country at that time.The New England Journal of Medicine, known in 1890 as The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal 122(11): page 257 The act defined requirements for a physician's license that were extremely loose by modern standards, but which were sufficient to expel thousands of untrained and unqualified physicians and quacks from the state during the first year after it was passed.Illinois State Board of Health, First Annual Report of the Illinois State Board of Health, 1878 Springfield: Weber, Magie and Co. State Printer, 1879 Popular opposition to this measure was strong, and outraged citizens complained that a law requiring doctors to obtain a license to practice medicine was \\"an opening wedge for socialized medicine\\" in the state.William K. Beatty, M.D. (1991) \\"John H. Rauch‚ÄîPublic Health, Parks and Politics\\" in The Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago Volume 44 page 107 Mrs. Dr. Keck refused to stop treating her patients in Illinois and quickly emerged as one of the most formidable opponents to the state's legal reform effort. As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John H. Rauch M.D., that lasted for at least a decade. When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the Bloomington Daily Leader called hers the first test case of the new legislation, \\"the beginning of a long and tedious litigation\\" between the \\"regulars\\" and the \\"irregulars.\\"Bloomington Daily Leader February 12, 1878 page 4 The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today. Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for practicing medicine without a license between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W. S. McCoyThe People of Illinois vs. Rebecca Keck Case No. 1686, Circuit Court of Champaign County, Ill. March 1886 etc. and persisted in business in McLean, Logan, Champaign, Peoria and Adams counties in Illinois for twenty years.Decatur Review February 6, 1884, and hundreds of advertisements in newspapers from those cities Iowa's medical legislation had even less effect on her business, and she opened Mrs. Dr. Keck's Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases in Davenport in 1879, practicing with uninterrupted financial success there and in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and rural communities in Iowa until she retired in 1900.Davenport Daily Republican July 11, 1900, page 5  Accusations of quackery  Over the years, Mrs. Dr. Keck grew more and more boastful of her ability to cure many types of chronic diseases, including tuberculosis, an obviously impossible task in an era before the bacillus that caused the disease had even been identified. Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,Davenport Daily Gazette Nov. 10, 1881.Dr. Mrs.Keck's Medical Infirmary a four-page advertising flyer published by Rebecca J. Keck circa 1894, and thousands of advertisements published in newspapers, business directories and gazettes across upper Illinois and eastern Iowa between 1873 and 1900--see Newspaperarchive.com Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.James Harvey Young, The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation, Princeton, NJ: The Princeton University Press, 1961. Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck. However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured. Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved \\"heroic\\" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.Paul Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine Basic Books, 1982. Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases. It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.See for example: W.R.Alexander vs. Edward Emerson Case No. 1724, District Court of the State of Iowa for Scott County. November 6, 1890 etc. The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.  Bibliography  * Beatty, William K. M.D. (1991) \\"John H.

Motor bus services in Portsmouth began in 1919, and were expanded in the 1930s following the closure of the Portsmouth Corporation Transport tram network. Trolleybuses were also operated between 1934 and 1963. Until 1988 the majority of services were provided by Portsmouth Corporation Transport, a municipal bus company owned by Portsmouth City Council. Other services into the city were operated by Southdown Motor Services, latterly as a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. Prior to bus deregulation and the privatisation of National Bus Company in 1986, the Gosport & Fareham Omnibus Company was merged with the western part of Hants & Dorset in April 1983 to form the Provincial Bus Company which was sold to its employees in 1987 and renamed People's Provincial which then expanded into Portsmouth in the early 1990s. Southdown was sold to its management at privatisation. The municipal operation was sold to a consortium consisting of its employees and Southampton Citybus in 1988, and was rebranded as Portsmouth Citybus. In 1989 both Southdown and Portsmouth Citybus were sold to the Stagecoach Group, but the group was forced to divest most of the Portsmouth services and they were sold to Transit Holdings in 1991. The expanding FirstGroup acquired People's Provincial in 1995 and the Transit Holdings operation, by now trading as Red Admiral and Blue Admiral in 1996. The group's later acquisition of Southampton Citybus and Southern National saw the companies combined to form First Hampshire & Dorset, which provides the majority of services in the city today. Stagecoach in the South Downs, the name under which Southdown now trades, operates longer-distance services. Coach services into Portsmouth are operated by National Express, which runs several routes to the city, and Stagecoach's Megabus coach division, which operates services to London in competition with National Express. Greyhound UK, a division of FirstGroup, served the city between 2009 and 2012. A coach service to Southampton operated by Solent Blue Line was withdrawn in 2009. Urban services Beginnings (pre-1919) The first horse-drawn bus service in Portsmouth began in 1840, and by the late 1850s such services had expanded to cover several different route. Horse-drawn trams were introduced in 1865, and progressively expanded over the following three decades. By the 1890s most of the horse trams and many of the horse bus routes were operated by the Portsmouth Street Tramways Company which was a subsidiary of The Provincial Tramways Company. In 1904, the last horse bus service was withdrawn. The tram system was purchased by Portsmouth Town Council and converted to electric operation in 1901, by which time it was operated as Portsmouth Corporation Transport (PCT). Early attempts to introduce motorised buses to the city, including in 1906 by the Isle of Wight Motor Bus Company, proved unsuccessful. In 1906 and again in 1911, the council turned down proposals to supplement the tram network with buses. However, in 1919 ten vehicles were introduced on a single route, beginning an operation that would last for almost 70 years. Council operations (1919‚Äì1986) AEC trolleybus new to Portsmouth Corporation Transport in 1934 A 1973 view of a Leyland Atlantean bus in service with PCT Alexander bodywork in service in 1975 PCT soon faced competition from two private operators, Portsmouth & District Motor Services Ltd and the Southsea Tourist Company, who ran bus services over routes covered by the tram network. Twelve vehicles were added to the fleet in 1924 and two new routes introduced. One of the new routes, which originally terminated at Cosham, was extended to Drayton in 1925 in competition with a route provided by Southdown Motor Services, which retaliated by running more journeys into Portsmouth. A change in legislation in 1927 saw the routes return to their original form. The corporation's livery, previously scarlet and ochre, was changed to red and white in 1931 in response to Portsmouth gaining city status four years earlier. The tram system began to decline in the 1930s. Trolleybus services replaced trams on one route in 1934, and by November 1936, all tram services in Portsmouth had been withdrawn. Bus and trolleybus services were reduced during World War II, when the city's dockyards were a target for bombing and its population depleted by evacuation and military service. Unusually, at this time there were two numbers (or letters for trolleybuses) for each route, depending on the direction. In 1946 an agreement was reached between PCT and Southdown to operate jointly on some routes. Leigh Park, which expanded rapidly after the war, was served for the first time in 1949; although this was intended to be a short-term measure prior to the introduction of trolleybus services, the route was never served by trolleybuses. A number of new vehicles were added to the bus fleet in the late 1940s and 1950s, and in 1958 one-person operation was introduced. Trolleybus operation in Portsmouth ended in July 1963. From 1963 until the late 1970s PCT standardised on the double-deck Leyland Atlantean for new purchases, retaining much older vehicles for open-top services. In 1971 the company took the unusual step of purchasing twelve Atlanteans with single-deck bodywork. Passenger numbers declined in the following decades, and services were reduced. PCT began private hire operation in 1980, and purchased its first coach in 1986. In October 1986, to coincide with bus deregulation and the privatisation of National Bus Company (NBC), Portsmouth Corporation Transport was reformed as Portsmouth City Transport, a limited company wholly owned by the city council. Deregulation and changes of operator (1986‚Äì1991) In 1987, a new operator began competing with Portsmouth City Transport. Trading as Red Admiral, it was jointly owned by newly privatised Southampton Citybus and the rapidly expanding Badgerline group. Badgerline sold its share in the venture to Southampton Citybus after less than a year. In June 1988, Portsmouth City Transport was privatised. It was sold to a joint venture consisting of its employees and Southampton Citybus. The company was rebranded as Portsmouth Citybus and Red Admiral became a subsidiary of the company, operating largely with minibuses. While the main operation continued to use a variant of the red and ivory livery introduced in 1986, Red Admiral vehicles were painted into a red and black colour scheme. However, Citybus still faced strong competition from Southdown and People's Provincial, two former NBC subsidiaries which were now independent, and its finances were never entirely secure during its year of operation in this form. In October 1989, the Stagecoach Group bought Portsmouth Citybus. The group already owned Southdown, which it had bought earlier in the same year, and merged the Portsmouth-area operations of that company with its new acquisition to form Southdown Portsmouth, operating from the former council depot in Eastney. Southdown's depot in Hilsea was closed and its operations transferred to Eastney. As part of the purchase, Stagecoach agreed that two routes operated by its Hampshire Bus subsidiary in Southampton would be given up to Southampton Citybus. Vehicles began to be repainted into Stagecoach's corporate livery of white with red, blue and orange stripes. An inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) into Stagecoach's acquisition of Portsmouth Citybus concluded in July 1990 that the takeover was against the public interest but had not caused any adverse effects, and that Stagecoach should not be made to sell the operation. Both Portsmouth City Council and Hampshire County Council, together with a number of bus user groups in the area and the employees' trade unions, had supported the takeover, as it was felt that Citybus could not have continued to trade in the long term. However, the decision by the MMC was over-ruled by Nicholas Ridley, then the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and credited as the architect of bus deregulation.Jenkinson (1991) pp.64‚Äì65 Transit Holdings and FirstGroup (1991‚Äìpresent) A Mercedes-Benz minibus of First Hampshire & Dorset in Portsmouth. Older Mercedes-Benz minibuses were operated by Transit Holdings in Portsmouth. A First double-deck Volvo Olympian in service in the city A Dennis Dart SLF bus in Hovertravel livery on the Hoverbus service at the Southsea Hoverport On 20 January 1991, Stagecoach's operations in Portsmouth were sold to Transit Holdings, a group formed from the privatisation of Devon General. The company's lease on the depot in Eastney expired in May, so the former Southdown depot at Hilsea West was reopened and used by Transit Holdings. Stagecoach retained a small number of services into the city which had been operated by Southdown prior to 1989, but others, including the route to Fareham, transferred to the new operation.Jenkinson (1991) p.74 Under Transit Holdings ownership, bus operation in Portsmouth was completely remodelled. The Red Admiral name was revived as a trading name for services running to areas outside the city boundary, while Blue Admiral was introduced for routes entirely within the city. The entire fleet was replaced with minibuses, initially Ford Transits and later Iveco Daily vehicles for Blue Admiral and Mercedes-Benz 811D vehicles for Red Admiral services. Service frequencies rose to retain capacity, and Transit Holdings claimed that ridership had risen dramatically. However, some groups criticised the use of minibuses as having poor accessibility and giving uncomfortable ride quality. Transit Holdings began to contract in the mid-1990s, and in April 1996 the Portsmouth operation was sold to FirstGroup. A month later it was merged with People's Provincial, which First also owned, and a new livery of red and cream was introduced to the enlarged company. Larger vehicles were restored to replace minibuses on most routes. In 2003 Provincial was further merged with Southampton Citybus and the eastern part of Southern National, both earlier acquired by First, to form First Hampshire & Dorset, officially based at the former Southampton Citybus depot in Portswood. In December 2006 First Hampshire & Dorset was fined by the Traffic Commissioner for poor punctuality on its services in Portsmouth. The company stated that it had rerouted some services through the city to improve their performance. The provision of evening services in the city has been criticised by some local groups. In May 2011, some contracted journeys were cut after the city council was forced to implement spending cuts. One route entirely within the city is provided by Stagecoach in the South Downs. Branded as Hoverbus, it is operated in conjunction with Hovertravel and connects the Southsea Hoverport with Portsmouth Harbour and the railway station at . This was previously run by Tellings-Golden Miller as their only bus service in the city, however on the loss of their National Express contracts to Lucketts Travel their Portsmouth depot was closed in January 2009 and the bus and operation of the route transferred to Stagecoach. An inter-site bus service is operated by the University of Portsmouth to transport staff and students between different parts of the university. In summer 2012, Xelabus introduced an open-top service between The Hard and Eastney, restoring a form of service which had previously been common in the city but had ceased in 2002; however, the service was withdrawn in August 2012. Long-distance services Early years and nationalisation (1920‚Äì1987) Services originating outside the city were established in the 1920s by Southdown Motor Services and Hants & Dorset. The first was a joint route between Portsmouth and Southampton, introduced in 1922; this was followed a year later by a route linking the city to Winchester. In 1924 the routes were split at Fareham, with only Southdown continuing to serve Portsmouth. Two smaller operators in the area, Yellow Motor Service and Enterprise, were taken over by Hants & Dorset in 1924, returning their vehicles to Portsmouth. Some Southdown routes did not initially reach Portsmouth city centre, but stopped short in nearby suburbs, an early example being a route between Cosham and Drayton. In 1925, PCT extended one of its routes to cover this section. In response, Southdown extended its route to serve Portsmouth city centre. The routes reverted to their original form in 1927. During the 1930s, Southdown maintained a bus station in Portsmouth. In 1946 the company arranged an agreement with PCT to enable joint running on routes in Portsmouth. A preserved Leyland National used by People's Provincial in the 1980s Both Southdown and Hants & Dorset became part of the newly formed National Bus Company in 1968. A new route along the coast from Portsmouth to Brighton was introduced by Southdown in 1975. In 1983 Hants & Dorset was split to form four new companies. The eastern end of its former operating area, which included its few services into Portsmouth, were merged with the former Gosport & Fareham Omnibus Company to form the Provincial Bus Co.Townsin (1992) p.84 When NBC was privatised in the mid-1980s, Provincial was the only company to be sold under an Employee Share Ownership Plan, becoming independent in May 1987. Southdown was sold to its management in October 1987, and both companies quickly made changes.

It was taken over by the Stagecoach Group in August 1989. Two months later the same group acquired Portsmouth Citybus and merged the latter with the majority of Southdown's operations in the city to form Southdown Portsmouth. Southdown's depot at Hilsea was closed and operations moved to the former Portsmouth Citybus depot at Eastney. Stagecoach was forced to sell its Portsmouth operations, which passed to Transit Holdings in January 1991, together with the Hilsea site, which was reopened. Southdown retained a small number of services in the city, but its presence was reduced from that prior to 1989. Southdown's legal name was changed to South Coast Buses in April 1992, and its western operations were rebranded to Coastline Buses. Provincial, meanwhile, rebranded itself as People's Provincial, using a dark green and cream livery. It substantially expanded its operations in Portsmouth after Transit Holdings acquired Portsmouth Citybus, believing that its use of minibuses had left a gap in demand for services using larger vehicles. Former NBC vehicles such as the double-deck Bristol VR and single-deck Leyland National were used on most routes. The company was taken over by FirstGroup in October 1995. First acquired Portsmouth Citybus from Transit in April 1996 and merged the two under the Provincial name, giving the company complete dominance over routes within Portsmouth. Like PCT, it is now part of First Hampshire & Dorset. Coastline Buses continued to be used as a trading name by Stagecoach until 2003, when its depot in Eastbourne was closed and the surviving operations rebranded to Stagecoach in the South Downs. The name Stagecoach in Portsmouth was adopted for its services around the city. Stagecoach introduced 21 new buses to route 700, the Brighton-Portsmouth service introduced in 1975, after its passenger numbers doubled in five years up to 2010. The route is branded as \\"Coastliner\\", and has its own website. Countryliner, an independent operator, also served Portsmouth during the early 21st century. One journey per week in each direction ran on route X92, a Saturday-only service originating in Midhurst operated under contract to West Sussex County Council. The route was withdrawn in October 2011 following cuts to council funding. Coaches A Greyhound UK coach in Portsmouth shortly after the start of operations Portsmouth is served by National Express, which operates a number of routes to the city and currently provides twelve journeys per day between London and Portsmouth, offering journey times of around two hours. A competing service between the two cities was introduced by Megabus, a division of the Stagecoach Group, in February 2004. Further competition on the corridor appeared in September 2009, when Portsmouth and Southampton became the first destinations to be served by Greyhound UK, owned by FirstGroup; this service ceased in November 2012. Solent Blue Line operated a service linking Portsmouth to Southampton for four years from 2005. Prior to Blue Line's involvement, the route had been funded by both cities' council, but this did not continue. Latterly branded as the Solent Shuttle, the route was reduced in frequency in 2007 and finally withdrawn as loss-making in February 2009. Park and ride Portsmouth is served by a park and ride service from a site at Tipner, close to the M275 motorway. The site opened in April 2014 at a cost of ¬£28 million, providing 650 car parking spaces and including a new junction on the motorway and bus priority measures.Portsmouth park-and-ride service begins BBC News, 7 April 2014 The service was reported to have attracted over 7,000 passengers in the first week of operation.Portsmouth park and ride attracts 7,000 vehicles in first week The News (Portsmouth), 15 April 2014 A park and ride site at Tipner had earlier been proposed in 2007 as part of Portsmouth F.C.'s proposal to construct a new stadium. The site had previously been earmarked by the city council for a 2,000-space car park with a bus link to the city. The stadium project was later postponed. Another park and ride bus service is operated in Portsmouth on Saturdays and some bank holidays. It runs from a site in North Harbour to the city centre and Portsmouth Harbour. Infrastructure A view of The Hard Interchange in November 2009 The Hard Interchange is the main bus station in Portsmouth. Portsmouth City Council stated its intention to improve the site in August 2008. Work commenced in autumn 2015, with some revision to roads in the vicinity together with temporary bus stop provision on The Hard itself. The work was completed in June 2017. The city has several bus lanes, and two routes are the subject of quality bus partnership schemes between operators, the city council and Hampshire County Council. First Hampshire & Dorset's route 41, which used to run between Clanfield and Portsmouth and was marketed as Zip, was the subject of a quality bus partnership between First and three councils which utilises several features including bus priority measures. It has now been replaced by The Star service, running today as route 7. In 2004 the city became one of the first in the world to introduce real-time information to all of its bus stops and buses. The system was designed and developed by the city council and USA- based firm MeshNetworks.

It requires writing the names of the Seven Sleepers onto seven wafers, then singing an alliterative verse three times. The verse is written in half lines and was used for its assumed curative properties, although what the charm is supposed to be curing is still a matter of debate. Possible meanings Some scholars believe that the charm was supposed to help victims sleep more easily if they were suffering from a disease that caused convulsions. Another theory is that the dwarf, a being from Anglo-Saxon mythology, might originally have been a night demon of some kind. The night demon, according to this theory, could possibly have been the personification of the illness. Most theories that speculate that the dwarf represents some kind of disease usually think that the disease is related to sleeping because of the inclusion of the Seven Sleepers in the charm. According to one source, \\"The names of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus occur in various charms of the Middle Ages. They are usually, to secure sleep, but in some cases are to be employed against fever\\". Matthew Lewis also believes that the charm is related to helping someone who is having trouble sleeping, and he believes that knowing the origin of the word nightmare is key to understanding the charm. Although the etymology of nightmare is somewhat disputed, the word can possibly be translated as meaning \\"night monster.\\" According to Lewis, the dwarf in this charm is a manifestation of a night monster, as dwarfs were linked to the idea of evil spirits and thought to be capable of causing physical harm.

Ara production is unregulated in both method and quality, and its sale is prohibited in Bhutan. Previously, private individuals sold ara through shopkeepers despite the prohibition and faced a harsh government crackdown.

The Bhutanese government, meanwhile, is intent on discouraging excessive alcohol consumption, abuse, and associated diseases through taxation and regulation. Ara is also produced for religious purposes, especially in eastern Bhutan, where it serves as a Lhasoel offering on certain auspicious days. Ara is also believed to chemically ward off snakes, and is sometimes carried by children for protection. Through government efforts to reduce ara production and consumption in Lhuntse District, eastern Bhutan, locals conceded something should be done to curb the distinctly eastern Bhutanese tradition of heavy drinking.

Early life Armand du Paty de Clam's father and grandfather were both lawyers, the latter having been President of the Court of Bordeaux. Du Paty himself turned to a military career graduating from the military academy of Saint-Cyr in 1870. He served as an infantry officer, being promoted to lieutenant in 1874 and captain in 1877. He was assigned to the 1st Bureau of the General Staff in 1879 and then to the 3rd Bureau in 1887. In 1890 he became chef de bataillon (major), a promotion which would normally have meant returning to regimental duties. Du Paty de Clam however remained with the General Staff. Dreyfus affair In late September 1894, French military intelligence became aware of a spy within the army through a handwritten note (the bordereau) obtained by their agent within German embassy in Paris. Du Paty de Clam, then a major attached to the General Staff, was heavily involved in the investigation to find the spy, due principally to his expertise in graphology (handwriting analysis). A brief investigation (about 3 weeks) identified approximately half a dozen suspects; du Paty de Clam and his superior officers decided upon Captain Alfred Dreyfus, the only Jew on the General Staff, as the prime suspect. Du Paty de Clam was ordered to obtain a sample of Dreyfus's handwriting which could be used as irrefutable proof of his guilt. In mid-October 1894 an unsuspecting Dreyfus was summoned to a meeting with Major du Paty de Clam, two (civilian) police detectives and a man from French military intelligence. Feigning an injury to his writing hand, du Paty de Clam asked Dreyfus to take dictation; Paty de Clam proceeded to read out the exact words of the bordereau. Satisfied Dreyfus's writing matched that of the suspect, du Paty de Clam arrested Dreyfus immediately, transferring custody to the deputy head of French military intelligence Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, who'd been waiting in the next room.\\"Chronology of the Dreyfus Affair\\" Du Paty de Clam was charged with compiling the case against Dreyfus, but failed to uncover any further evidence against him. Some highly intimidating interrogation techniques failed to extract a confession or other incriminating statements from Dreyfus himself. Extensive searches of Dreyfus's house and those belonging to his relatives also produced no meaningful evidence. Nevertheless, Du Paty de Clam subsequently testified to Dreyfus's guilt at a court-martial in late December, 1894, mainly concerning the handwriting. He also handed over the infamous \\"secret dossier\\" to the judges in the case, although du Paty de Clam was unaware of its contents at the time. Du Paty de Clam was later promoted to lieutenant-colonel for his role in convicting Dreyfus.\\"1906, Dreyfus rehabilitated\\" When the conspiracy against Dreyfus began to be exposed, du Paty de Clam was involved in attempts to suppress the truth. In October 1897, as the name of the real spy (Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy) began to leak, du Paty de Clam (at the direction of his superiors) met with Esterhazy, warned of the allegations against him and promised to protect him. Around the same time, du Paty de Clam was intimately involved in telegrams sent to the prime whistle-blower in the affair, Colonel Georges Picquart, designed to intimidate and threaten Picquart. In November 1897 du Paty de Clam was also involved in further threatening letters sent by Esterhazy to Picquart and the Dreyfusards' chief ally within the government, Senator Auguste Scheurer-Kestner. Du Paty de Clam's position became precarious following the publication of Emile Zola's J'Accuse‚Ä¶! in January 1898, in which Zola declared \\"At the root of it all is one evil man, Lt. Colonel du Paty de Clam, who was at the time a mere Major. He is the entire Dreyfus case...\\". Following the arrest and suicide of his co-conspirator Major Henry and Esterhazy fleeing to England (both in August, 1898), the army made du Paty de Clam 'inactive' in September 1898. In March 1899 the Supreme Court of Appeals reviewed the Dreyfus case and ordered du Paty de Clam's arrest in June 1899, just prior to Dreyfus's re- trial (i.e. re-court-martial). Dreyfus reluctantly accepted a pardon in late 1899, accompanied by amnesty for all those involved in the case. Subsequent career and death Stigmatized by his role in the affair (\\"a criminal craftsman of detestable work\\") du Paty de Clam resigned from the army in early 1901. He successfully applied to be re-admitted to the military in 1913 as a lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army (reserve forces). He was wounded at the First Battle of Marne in September 1914, receiving the Legion of Honour. Du Paty de Clam died from his wounds at Versailles in 1916. His son, Charles du Paty de Clam, was appointed Commissioner-General for Jewish Affairs under the Vichy government between February and May 1944, mainly because his father had been Alfred Dreyfus's accuser. Personality Du Paty is described by a contemporary as having a pretentious manner, being abrupt in speech and given to mechanical gestures. He was fluent in German and a cultivated lover of German music. He was a social acquaintance of the German military attach√© Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen who referred to him as \\"having a touch of the blundering and erratic\\" which made him unsuited to the role required of him as a senior officer of the General Staff. A polyglot and devout Catholic, he also privately enjoyed transvestism, among other hobbies.

In his retirement, he became well known in lawn bowls. He donated the statue of James Cook in Victoria Square to the city. His family dwelling, Wharetiki House, was a prominent landmark on Colombo Street in the Christchurch Central City until its demolition in July 2011, following a demolition order by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. Early life ;Matthew Barnett Barnett was born in Avoca, Victoria, Australia, in 1859. He came from a large family and had ten siblings. His parents were William Barnett, a merchant, and Rachel Barnett (n√©e Mitchell). The family moved to Dunedin, New Zealand when Matthew was six as his father was attracted by the goldfields. He left school aged 13 or 14 and had a very brief employment as a photographer's apprentice, but did not like that profession. Instead, he was apprenticed to newspapers, first the Otago Guardian and later the Otago Daily Times. He worked in that profession for about five years. For the next four years, he worked in farming in Otago and South Canterbury. When he came to Oamaru, he became the proprietor of the 'Star and Garter Billiard Rooms', where he had his first exposure to betting on horse races. He returned to Dunedin for some time. From there, Barnett's family returned to Melbourne for another two years. He worked as a swagman in Australia and then had employment as a tram driver in Melbourne for several months. In Melbourne, he married Mary Bridget Barnett (n√©e Whelan) on 18 July 1888. ;Mary Barnett (n√©e Whelan) Mary's father James Whelan (1836‚Äì1908) immigrated to Castlemaine, Victoria from Ireland as a teenager. He married in 1858, but his wife died only ten months later. In 1862/63, James Whelan spent nine months on Otago goldfields during the Central Otago Gold Rush. He returned to Castlemaine and married Margaret Roughan in June 1863. They knew each other from Kilkishen, County Clare, Ireland and met in Melbourne by chance. Soon after, James returned to Otago, with Margaret following him later that year. Their first child, Mary, was born in Gabriel's Gully in ca 1864. The family moved to nearby Wetherstons and when the goldfields were exhausted (when Mary was twelve years old), the family moved to Dunedin. Mary travelled to Melbourne to visit relatives of her parents. In that city, she married Matthew Frank Barnett. ;Children The Barnett family ‚Äì standing from left: Tui, Olly, Ethel ‚Äì sitting from left: Alice May (Topsy), Ivy, Mary (n√©e Whelan), Matthew, Kate The Barnetts had six children; five girls and one boy: * Ethel Barnett (19 Apr 1889 ‚Äì 4 Apr 1945) * Matthew Oliver Barnett (Olly) (23 Mar 1890 ‚Äì 14 July 1977) * Ivy Kathleen Barnett (15 Oct 1891 ‚Äì 1965) * Alice May Barnett (Topsy) (15 May 1893 ‚Äì 1979) * Kate Elizabeth Barnett (19 Jan 1900 ‚Äì 26 September 1972) * Tui Frances Barnett (21 Dec 1903 ‚Äì 12 Dec 1962) Professional life Some time after their wedding, the couple moved to Otago to farm. Barnett's brother Thomas (Tom) had a business relationship with Peter Grant and they were placing racing bets together. Matthew Barnett joined them and for half a year, they worked together. After a substantial win, they dissolved their relationship and went on their own ways. ;Bookmaking Betting and bookmaking in the 1890s need to be seen in the then climate of moral and social change in New Zealand. Women's suffrage, temperance and anti-betting were strong movements, and gaming houses were banned, which included betting shops. Bookmakers responded to the situation by giving themselves titles like 'commission agents' and 'turf accountants'. Parliament was strongly lobbied by the pro-betting faction and consequently left decisions to the local level. Beginning with the Canterbury Trotting Club in 1897, racecourses responded by banning bookmakers from their properties. Those not adhering to the ban were being arrested and fined. Christchurch City Council passed a by-law in 1899 and banned bookmaking in public. Legislation was finally passed in 1908, banning gaming in public places and making it illegal for racing clubs to accept bets by telephone. An amendment to the Gaming Act in 1910 banned bookmaking altogether. It was in this climate that Matthew Barnett formed a partnership 'Barnett and Grant'. It came about because Peter Grant had been banned from a racecourse for refusing to leave. Barnett, who had earlier been banned from the same course for life, but who had managed to get that decision overturned, offered to Grant to bet on a joint account. A win of ¬£100 resulted and although the two never formalised their partnership, their further wins in this first year ran into the thousands. Luck left them, and after the second year they had lost all their earnings again. Luck was with them again, and some time after Grant's wedding in February 1896, they had sufficient capital to add a branch in Christchurch to their existing betting shop in Dunedin. Initially, the Dunedin business had to financially support the Christchurch branch, but under Barnett's business leadership in Christchurch, the situation changed and Christchurch supported the Dunedin branch. The Christchurch premises were in the central city at 174 Hereford Street, and from 1905 on the opposite side of the road at 163 Hereford Street. Barnett and Grant were banned from racecourses, e.g. in Palmerston in 1892 and in Dunedin in 1894. They had frequent encounters with law enforcement, and they were arrested numerous times. Their Dunedin branch was searched by Police and Barnett, Grant and two employees arrested in September 1897. Between 1901 and 1904, they were arrested three times, including in January 1902, their Christchurch office was raided by Police, with the case going to court the following month. The case went to a jury trial, but all the witnesses refused to give evidence, as they would have incriminated themselves by doing so, as it was illegal to visit a gaming house. Without any witness statements, the jury delivered a not guilty verdict. For a 1906 raid of the Christchurch office, the Police had previously sent an undercover agent to the office to place a bet in order to have some evidence for a court case. In 1909, Barnett was convicted of having published horse betting details in his publication Daylight that violated the Gaming Act 1908. He appealed the conviction and it was overturned by Justice Sim as being erroneous in point of law. With the passing of the 1910 amendment to the Gaming Act, Barnett decided to officially retire as a bookmaker, but it is likely that he continued to work underground. Barnett's weekly sport magazine Daylight was taken over by The Press. ;Arthur Barnett's Barnett's younger brother had been apprenticed as a draper. In 1903, he established a drapery store Arthur Barnett in Dunedin. Matthew Barnett guaranteed a ¬£900 loan to get the business going. It developed into the leading drapery store in Otago. Matthew Barnett retained a business interest and became chair of the board. At his death, his son Olly took that role, and he in turn passed the chairmanship to his son Gary. The Arthur Barnett department store developed into a national chain. At its peak in the 1980s, it had 19 stores and 1,200 employees. Wharetiki House Wharetiki in the early 2000s In 1901, Barnett bought a large section in the Christchurch central city, fronting onto Salisbury and Colombo Streets. A large family home, which he named Wharetiki, was built by 1904. The address was 854 Colombo Street, and his friend and business partner Peter Grant had a house built nearby at 901 Colombo Street two years later. Wharetiki was a large and representative dwelling, displaying the wealth of its owner. It had several servants and Mary Barnett's unmarried younger sister Maria (known as Polly) was in charge of them. Mary's father suffered a brain injury in 1888 and spent the remaining 20 years of his life at Seacliff Mental Hospital. When he died in 1908, his wife Margaret and the children who were still at home moved to a different house in Dunedin, but later on she and her second youngest child, Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki. Margaret Whelan made many spontaneous trips back to Dunedin when she got nostalgic and would stay there for a few weeks at a time, but she would otherwise live at Wharetiki for the rest of her life. Mary Barnett fell ill in 1930 and was confined to a wheel chair. The back stairs of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, so that she could move around the house. After Matthew Barnett's death, the remaining family members put the house up for auction in May 1935. It existed until 2011, when it was demolished after suffering significant damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Wharetiki House was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building. Philanthropy Statue of Captain Cook in Victoria Square, Christchurch On journeys from Christchurch to Dunedin, Barnett would throw half-crowns to the swagmen working on the roads, as he would remember the hard times that he had when he worked on the roads in Victoria. ;Cook Statue In 1928, Barnett funded an architectural competition for a statue commemorating the three journeys of James Cook to New Zealand. William Trethewey (1892‚Äì1956) won this competition and was chosen as the sculptor; this was his biggest commission in his career so far. A 12-ton block of Carrara marble was imported for this work. Barnett also funded the sculpture itself, which was unveiled on 10 August 1932 in Victoria Square by the Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe. This commission brought Trethewey much publicity, including coverage on Movietone News. The Cook Statue is registered as a Category II heritage item by Heritage New Zealand. ;Barnett Tiki In his retirement, Barnett had started to play lawn bowls, and he became well known both as a player and administrator. In bowling circles, he was known as Mat Barnett. The Canterbury Bowling Club was only 100 m down the road on Salisbury Street. Since the early 1900s, Canterbury and Wellington had an annual competition. In 1924, Barnett commissioned a tiki as a trophy for this tournament and he personally supervised the carving. The mahogany carving was presented at the Canterbury Bowling Club in February 1925. The first annual competition with the Barnett Tiki was held a few days later in Wellington and was won by Christchurch. Whilst it was decided that the winning team should hold the Tiki until the next competition, the trophy was left in Wellington after the first competition in 1925. Death Margaret Whelan died on 24 February 1926 at Wharetiki, aged 89. She was buried at Bromley Cemetery in block number 27. Mary Barnett died on 1 March 1931 at Wharetiki, aged 66. She was buried at Bromley Cemetery in block number 24 in plot 1 two days later. Matthew Barnett died on 28 January 1935, aged 75, also at Wharetiki. He was buried next to his wife the following day. There are white marble chippings scattered on their grave, which are remnants from the production of the Cook Statue. Through his will, Matthew Barnett left ¬£35,000 to his brother Arthur as a guarantee for his business.

High school In his senior year, Carter helped lead the San Ramon Valley Wolves to an 11‚Äì2 record and their first North Coast Section championship. In the 46‚Äì20 victory in the championship game, he caught eight passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns, rushed five times for 88 yards and a touchdown, caught two 2-point conversions, and intercepted a pass. He was voted most valuable player of the game. For the season, he was named the North Coast Section Offensive Player of the Year after catching 63 passes totaling 1,515 yards (24.0 avg.) for 19 TDs. He was also selected to the All-Metro and All-San Francisco Chronicle first teams. College career Carter started out his collegiate career at UC Davis as the Great West Rookie of the Year in 2006 after catching 54 passes for 703 yards and five touchdowns, earning him second-team All-Great West Conference honors. After starting the first two games of the season, he lost the remainder of his sophomore year after tearing the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in his left knee. In 2008, he recovered and was named All-Great West Conference First Team after a team-best 69 receptions with 768 and 5 touchdowns. In his senior year, Carter set the school record for most receptions in a game (18) against Montana in September. However, Carter discovered four games into the season that he had torn cartilage in his left knee attributed to his body compensating for his 2007 PCL injury. Although unable to practice most of the year, he continued to play with the injury. Carter had nine catches for 96 yards and two touchdowns to help UC Davis win the Great West title in a 28-20 victory against North Dakota. For the season, Carter recorded 85 receptions‚Äîthe second highest total in school history‚Äîfor 889 yards and four touchdowns. He was named the 2009 Great West Offensive Player of the Year.

Professional career Due to his injury, Carter was unable to participate in the NFL Scouting Combine or any other workouts. He was on crutches for two months, and required six months for his knee to recover. Carter went undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft after being considered a probable late-round pick. He was signed by the Seattle Seahawks to a futures contract in January 2011 after drawing their attention during a tryout. However, the NFL lockout cost him the opportunity to establish himself during mini-camps and organized team workouts. He was waived on August 29, re-signed on August 31 but released again on September 3 during the Seahawks' final roster cuts before the 2011 regular season.

D. W. Griffith is stated in some sources as co-director or perhaps had limited input as the production was filmed at his Mamaroneck, New York production facilities. Lillian Gish wrote the story and scenario incognito as Dorothy Elizabeth Carter with Algonquin Round Table writer Dorothy Parker supplying the intertitles. Thus the movie was nearly an all-woman produced movie with the exception of the cameraman. The film, currently classified as lost, stars Lillian's sister Dorothy Gish and Dorothy's husband at the time James Rennie.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1911-1920 by The American Film Institute (1988) George W. Hill, who is the cinematographer, later directed classic films at MGM like Tell It to the Marines (1926) and The Big House (1930). Plot As described in film publications, Janie (Gish) gets married with the goal of reforming her husband Jack (Rennie), but he still has the eyes for other women. He promises to reform, but says he is ashamed because she lacks the style of a flapper. All goes well until he meets a pretty woman with a heavy suitcase. He helps her into a taxi cab and takes her home. Janie sees him as she rides by on a bus. That affair gets him into wrong, but he manages to square it with his wife. Then a good looking manicure girl comes into his life, and again Jack falls. Once again Janie is on the job at the psychological moment. This time she leaves him in haste and goes home to her mother. Janie tries to forget Jack by taking a job in her father's office. Jack, who loves her sincerely, is filled with remorse and despair. He calls upon her to beg her forgiveness and, since she still loves him, she yields. But when he attempts to lay down the law to her, she presses a button on her desk and he finds himself being escorted from the office. He threatens suicide, and this is too much for Janie. She comes back to him and they live together happily.

Much is made of the latter in a title leader, which sets forth that this day is one where woman is asserting herself in all the arts, and therefore it is time she undertook the direction of pictures. :But Lillian does not qualify as a particularly strong directress in this production. The story may have had something to do with that. It is not a world beater but with the action that Dorothy supplies it gets by with laughs. :James Rennie, who plays opposite the star, is the only member of the supporting cast who seems to have more than a ‚Äòbit‚Äô to do. The others while acceptable fail to show often enough to get a line on them. It is a picture that is Dorothy Gish, hook, line and sinker, and it would sink if it weren‚Äôt for her.

His recent work on global warming has been questioned by environmentalists. His 2009 book Chill: a reassessment of global warming theory argued that most of the recent documented warming is caused by peaking natural cycles, that there is also a potential for global cooling and that adaptation not mitigation should be a priority. His views received widespread coverage in the media ‚Äì with front page on the Daily Express, and articles in the online versions of The Mail, The Times and an Al Jazeera video. Education Born in January 1948, Taylor was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in Glamorgan, Wales from where he won an Open Scholarship to St Catherine's College, Oxford University. He graduated with honours in Natural Sciences from the School of Zoology in 1970. As a student he led a successful inter-university biological expedition to East Africa; After six years of what he describes in his autobiography Shiva's Rainbow as an adventurer and explorer, including a solo vehicle-crossing of the Sahara and climbing the Eiger, he returned to Oxford to study Social Anthropology under the linguistic anthropologist Edwin Ardener. Taylor has been a member of the Institute of Biology and is a Certified Biologist, a former member of the International Union of Radioecologists, the International Society for Radiation Protection and the British Ecological Society. He is currently a member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Political Ecology Research Group Taylor left his academic studies in anthropology order to develop the Political Ecology Research Group (PERG) which he founded in 1976. Eschewing the academic elements of political ecology and the need for theory in favour of political involvement, the group pioneered scientific and legal support for environmental policy initiatives and worked closely with Greenpeace International, Trade Unions and at times government agencies. The group held copyright on all its work and published over 20 research reports between 1978 and 1992. Taylor published an account of the anti-nuclear movement in The Ecologist - a text used by the Open University for its Control of Technology Course, an on assessments of nuclear risk in the science journal Nature. Taylor became a public figure following the 1977 Windscale Inquiry into nuclear fuel reprocessing during which he exposed the risks of nuclear waste storage and mounted a successful campaign against radioactive discharges to the marine environment ‚Äì his work was widely reported in the national press, New Scientist, The Ecologist and the New Internationalist. Between 1980 and 1992 he became an advisor to a wide spectrum of organisations, ranging from government agencies to environmental NGOs, appearing on TV and radio on issues of nuclear risk and pollution. His work uncovered the health impact of the Windscale Fire in 1957 - in the PERG report RR-7, and in association with Yorkshire TV, the excess of childhood cancers around Sellafield. He served on the government commission into nuclear waste dumping at sea (chaired by Sir Fred Holliday) which recommended the practice be banned. He also sat on a research advisory group on nuclear waste management set up by the Department of Environment ‚Äì resigning when he felt government were not allowing time for detailed comparative assessment of the options. The work of PERG played a role in limiting the development of nuclear fuel reprocessing and the 'plutonium economy', particularly in Germany, cleaning up discharges to the Irish Sea, altering perceptions of the risks of ionising radiation and the consequences of reactor meltdowns. The group also produced the first study in renewable energy strategies in a report for the European Parliament in 1980; the first comparative study of organic and conventional agriculture, and the first UK study of forestry as carbon sequestration. Taylor involved both of his brothers during the 1980s campaigns, with Ron infiltrating the US Nevada weapons test site and leading the Greenpeace climb of Big Ben and Robert heading the Greenpeace international strategy on chemical wastes. In 1992, PERG evolved into an international network of independent experts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems ‚Äì Terramar√®s ‚Äì to carry out critical science policy analysis. This group worked collectively and individually behind the scenes in several important developments ‚Äì with Professor Jackson Davis helping to lay the foundation for the Framework Climate Convention, and in Clean Production Strategies and the Precautionary Principle with Tim Jackson (now Professor of Sustainable Development at the University of Surrey); and further work on energy strategies with Gordon Thompson who now leads the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts (ref IRSS). Taylor's work on ocean pollution culminated in 1993 with a critique of the UN's ocean protection system in the peer-reviewed journal Bulletin of Marine Pollution. Beyond Conservation He then moved from Oxford to North Wales to follow up his long-standing interests in wildlife conservation and shamanism. As a member of the British Association of Nature Conservationists he organised the conference 'Wilderness Britain' in 1995 and organised a National Trust seminar on wilderness and wildland values at its Centennial Conference. He was a keynote speaker at the BANC/National Trust 1999 'Nature in Transition' conference in July 1999 and co-authored the National Trust's document 'Call for the Wild'. His articles in BANC's journal ECOS contributed to the new wave of consciousness in conservation known as 'rewilding' culminating in 2005 with the publication of Beyond Conservation and the founding of the Wildland Network. In this work Taylor argues that conservation is too preservation oriented and needs to be more creative and focussed upon wilder and larger scale land management. Chris Baines, a British conservationist, described Taylor's book as important and brilliantly capturing the changing mood of conservation and Peter Marren gave it a one page spread in the Independent. Alan Watson Featherstone, of Trees For Life endorsed the cover with 'this book offers a beacon of hope to all those who draw spiritual sustenance from wild Nature' and Bill Adams, at Cambridge University, also endorsing the cover said 'Peter Taylor builds bridges between ecology, countryside policy and spirituality'. In networking ecological practitioners and land managers, Taylor worked to construct a political strategy for rewilding conservation through regional seminars, national conferences and in 2008, his colleague in the network Steve Carver founded the Wildland Research Institute at Leeds University. Energy and climate change In the lead up to his work on climate change, Taylor had been engaged at government level to develop strategies for the integration of renewable energy into countryside policy on community and biodiversity. Between 2000 and 2003, he was appointed to the UK National Advisory Group of the Community Renewables Initiative ‚Äì a joint Countryside Agency and Department of Trade and Industry task-force on community scale renewable energy. To aid this work he set up the design consultancy Ethos, which combined science expertise from Terramar√®s with graphic design and the use of computer virtual reality for visualising change and integrating development in the countryside. His controversial reassessment of global warming theory in 2009 outlined his concern that the remedies for climate change might prove more damaging to the environment than the ailment itself. Taylor argued that his work with the CRI had given him a deeper insight into the impacts associated with powering a modern economy from renewable sources. Despite an endorsement by the drafting author of the Kyoto Protocol ‚Äì Professor Jackson Davis, with whom he worked at the UN and who had played a role in setting up the Framework Climate Convention, the book received little publicity at first ‚Äì but in the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, his views were widely publicized. However, Taylor is critical of how the environmental movement and left-liberal press have ignored the book - it was not reviewed in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, nor in New Scientist, all of which had previously covered his work. He has become a target of attacks focussed either on whether he is adequately qualified to review climate science or on his embrace of mystical philosophy and shamanism. His detractors have focussed upon his statements in Shiva's Rainbow of how science in public policy is mostly theatre and how he was more of an actor than a scientist. Taylor admits freely that most of his work was as a lawyer - 'the ultimate actor', but argues that his record as a skilled and experienced policy analyst has been glossed over by those who are averse to his message on climate change. Yoga and healing work In his autobiography, Taylor gives an account of studying with the yogic master Babaji, training with the founder of rebirthing Leonard Orr, and practising as a breathing therapist and teacher of meditation ‚Äì in which he now has an international reputation, whilst at the same time being heavily involved in environmental activism. In recent years he has also trained with western shamanic practitioners and brings this perspective into his ecological conservation work and is often invited to speak at 'alternative' conventions where he has outlined his understanding of the connections between science and consciousness. Taylor featured in Karen Sawyer's The Dangerous Man as someone who challenges the fixed paradigms of science and social control. He warns in his recent presentations and in his autobiography, that humanity faces a crisis of consciousness and that much of the enthusiasm and caring for the Earth especially among young people, is being channelled into collusion with undemocratic corporate power structures in the banking world. In this vein, he argues in Chill that mitigation of climate change is a delusion and that resources need to be channelled into adaptation and the creation of resilient human communities and a robust biodiversity.

Currently in the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building Alexander Brook (July 14, 1898 ‚Äì February 26, 1980) was an American artist, teacher, and art critic, known for his paintings. He was active from 1910 until 1966.  Biography  Brook was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 14, 1898 to a Russian family. At the age of twelve he was bed-ridden with polio. It was during this time that he received his first lessons in painting. In 1914 he entered the Art Students League of New York, where he studied for four years with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Christen Johansen, Frank DuMond, George Bridgman, and Dimitri Romanovski. There he met the painter Peggy Bacon, whom he married in 1920. Brook also studied at the Pratt Institute. During his twenties, Brooks painted still lifes and posed figures with vigor and sensuality. He later began to emulate the style of Jules Pascin. From 1924-1927 he was the assistant director of the Whitney Studio Club. He also worked as a reviewer for The Arts magazine. His realist painting was exhibited widely and he won multiple awards. Children's Lunch won the Frank G Logan prize at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1929 and Georgia Jungle won the Carnegie Prize at the Carnegie International art exhibition in 1939. He also received the Temple gold medal at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1931 and a gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition in 1937. Unfortunately for Brook, the realist style fell out of favor late in the 1940s. Brook taught at the Art Students League of New York from 1933 until 1936 and again from 1942 until 1943. About 1940, he was divorced from Peggy Bacon. After a second marriage to Libby Bergere and spells living in Savannah, Georgia, in 1945 he married his third wife, the painter Gina Knee. In 1948 they moved to Sag Harbor on eastern Long Island, where he retired from painting around 1965. His work can be found at a variety of museum collections, such as the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Albright-Knox Gallery.

Through Vic Agather they had an agreement that should one be found that was owned by the government but not in use, it would be turned over to the CAF.Warbird Digest 2006, p. 52. In 1971, a CAF pilot in the National Guard reported sighting a number of what might be B-29s on the California desert near China Lake. The CAF learned the aircraft were indeed Superfortresses that had been parked at a US Navy weapons center for 17 years.Peltzer 2002, pp. 21‚Äì23. The aircraft had been used for gunnery targets and abused by heat, sand and vandals. After much negotiation (the US Air Force owned the aircraft; the Navy had to agree to release one), much paperwork and a painstaking search for the best survivor, the CAF became the owner of s/n 44-62070, officially acquired title on 23 March 1971, registering it as N4249. FIFI from the DC Flyover, 5/8/2015.A CAF maintenance team arrived at China Lake on 31 March 1971 and in only nine weeks, with the help of more CAF volunteers, they restored all systems and replaced fuel, oil and hydraulic hoses. The restoration process involved cannibalizing parts from other B-29s at China Lake, installing instruments, having new window bubbles made and restoring controls to working order. After the CAF technicians ran the engines, tested propellers and landing gear, N4249 was made ready to fly again by 3 August 1971.O'Leary 1998, p. 39. They had a permit to make a single ferry flight out of China Lake although once it landed, the B-29 would be grounded.Warbird Digest 2006, p. 53.

Inspired by Bigtable, LevelDB is hosted on GitHub under the New BSD License and has been ported to a variety of Unix- based systems, macOS, Windows, and Android. Features LevelDB stores keys and values in arbitrary byte arrays, and data is sorted by key. It supports batching writes, forward and backward iteration, and compression of the data via Google's Snappy compression library. LevelDB is not an SQL database. Like other NoSQL and dbm stores, it does not have a relational data model and it does not support SQL queries. Also, it has no support for indexes. Applications use LevelDB as a library, as it does not provide a server or command-line interface. MariaDB 10.0 comes with a storage engine which allows users to query LevelDB tables from MariaDB.LevelDB storage engine History LevelDB is based on concepts from Google's Bigtable database system. The table implementation for the Bigtable system was developed starting in about 2004, and is based on a different Google internal code base than the LevelDB code. That code base relies on a number of Google code libraries that are not themselves open sourced, so directly open sourcing that code would have been difficult. Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat wanted to create a system resembling the Bigtable tablet stack that had minimal dependencies and would be suitable for open sourcing, and also would be suitable for use in Chrome for the IndexedDB implementation. They wrote LevelDB starting in early 2011, with the same general design as the Bigtable tablet stack, but not sharing any of the code. Usage LevelDB is used as the backend database for Google Chrome's IndexedDB and is one of the supported backends for Riak.LevelDB. Docs.basho.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-18. Additionally, Bitcoin Core and go- ethereum stores the blockchain metadata using a LevelDB database. Minecraft Bedrock Edition uses a modified version for chunk and entity data storage.https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pocket_Edition_level_format Autodesk AutoCAD 2016 also uses LevelDB. Performance Google has provided benchmarks comparing LevelDB's performance to SQLite and Kyoto Cabinet in different scenarios. LevelDB outperforms both SQLite and Kyoto Cabinet in write operations and sequential-order read operations. LevelDB also excels at batch writes, but is slower than SQLite when dealing with large values. The currently published benchmarks were updated after SQLite configuration mistakes were noted in an earlier version of the results. Updated benchmarksDatabase Microbenchmarks , Symas Corp., 2012-09.

When her father takes her with him to Paris on a business trip to ensure she works on her school thesis, Andi discovers a journal written by a girl her age, Alexandrine Paradis, two centuries earlier which has its own tragedies inside. Revolution was an Amazon Best Book of the Year (2010) and honored by Kirkus Reviews and School Library Journal; the audiobook version received a 2011 American Library Association Odyssey Honor. Plot summary Andi Alpers is doing the best she can to take care of her mother's deep depression while popping pills for her own. Her father is off living with his pregnant 25-year-old girlfriend, her grades are falling apart, and if she does not turn in her thesis outline after break, she will be kicked out of school. Her best friend Vijay does all he can to help her move on. But she does not care, because she knows it is her fault that her ten-year-old brother was killed by a crazy man named Max, who, trying to stay away from the cops grabbed her brother Truman and held a knife to his neck. Max, feeling threatened by a cop pulling out a gun, jumped into the street and was hit by a delivery van while still holding Andi's brother, killing them both, while she was ditching school with Nick Goode when she really should have been walking her brother to school. The only thing that keeps her alive is her music. But then her father swoops back into the picture after hearing about her grades. He ships her mother off into a mental hospital to recover and takes Andi to Paris with him to make sure she writes the outline for her thesis. He is there to do a DNA test on the remains of a heart believed to be that of Louis- Charles, the young son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who was locked away during the French Revolution and believed to have died in the tower at the age of ten. Despite this, rumors of the Lost Dauphin's escape were numerous, as were the people who stepped up to claim the throne at the end of the Revolution. Andi becomes more interested in this story when she discovers the diary of Alexandrine Paradis, a girl who played with and watched over the prince in her youth and later became a hunted figure nicknamed The Green Man because she continued to set off fireworks all around the city for the prince to see from the tower, so he would not lose hope. As she reads through the diary, Andi almost starts to believe that Alex wants her to finish reading it instead of working on her musical DNA project on Amad√© Malherbeau, a famous musician of around the same time who is known for his quirky style. During her library adventures in research and exploring around Paris, Andi meets Virgil, a taxi driver, and they begin an odd courtship of musical discourse over the phone after she accidentally leaves her iPod with him after making music together at a bar. All the while, the music she plays on her guitar and the talks she and Virgil have keep her hoping for a better future, despite her fights with her father and her emotional distress over memories the diary evokes of her own brother. After her frantic attempt to get up to the top of the Eiffel Tower to commit suicide, Virgil drags her with him down to a closed off part of the catacombs of Paris, where the bones of the thousands of dead were laid to rest centuries ago, to play at a party. When the police come in to break things up and everyone is running everywhere, Andi is suddenly transported to the 18th century and everyone thinks she is Alex. Her savior is the subject of her thesis, Malherbeau, and her confused babblings are attributed to the crack in the head she took while stumbling in the darkness of the catacombs, until she starts playing her guitar in public at the base of the tower for Louis-Charles to hear and is seriously heckled by those present. Andi carries out the rest of Alex's mission, knowing that the heart in the jar that her father is testing is indeed Louis-Charles, and that he will die in just a few nights. In exchange for his help, she gives Malherbeau her iPod, and he listens to Beethoven play music he has not finished composing yet, as well as music from more recent artists such as Radiohead. Andi returns to her own century wondering if all that had happened was true or some strange effect from her medication and the knock to the head. She also returns with a sense of acceptance of all that has happened. In the epilogue, Andi is living in France with her mother, who has gotten over her own depression with help. She still has a strained relationship with her father, who is with his new family, but enjoys playing music with Virgil around Paris.

With a height of 275.9 m above sea level it is, from a topographical point of view, not a particularly impressive eminence in this part of the Wiehen Hills, because, in the immediate vicinity are considerably higher summits, such as the 320 m high Heidbrink just under 1 km to the south. East of the Reinberg on the other side of a valley bottom rises the Heidkopf, west of the Meesenkopf, on the summit of which there was once a fortification. 230 metres southwest of the summit lies the Wittekind Spring, that had a certain importance for the garrison of the castle at the summit, but today is just a small pond by a rock outcrop at the edge of a track. The Reineberg, which is the local hill for the town of L√ºbbecke, owes its significance to the fact that, until 1723, the year of its demolition, Reineberg Castle ( or Reineburg) stood here.  History of Reineberg castle (Reineburg)  The origins of the country castle (Landesburg) of Reineberg are lost in legend. According to the episcopal chronicler of the town of Minden the founding of the castle goes back to Bishop Conrad I of R√ºdenberg (1209‚Äì1237). Osnabr√ºck sources report, however, that the Osnabr√ºck bishop, Adolf von Tecklenburg (1216‚Äì1224), was the co-founder (Miterbauer). Artist's impression of the castle In 1271 Reinberg Castle was first mentioned in the records. In the outgoing years of the 13th century the bishops of Osnabr√ºck and Minden were the common owners of the castle. Reineberg Castle acted as a fortified base of power for the bishops of Minden. Their intent was to hold their own against the Bishop of Osnabr√ºck, the counts of Tecklenburg and the lords (Edelherren) of Diepholz. Later their importance grew even more through the expansion of the governance of the territory. Reineberg Castle was, as mentioned, according to a treaty of 1306, initially in the common ownership of the neighbouring prince-bishops of Minden and Osnabr√ºck. In 1412 we find the knight (Ritter), Dietrich von M√ºnchhausen, as the tenant of the castle, in a dispute with his landlord, Bishop Wulbrand, and the cathedral chapter of Minden, because he had enfeoffed the Reineberg without permission to Count Nicholas II of Tecklenburg. The bishop protested and besieged the castle. Tecklenburg troops advanced to do battle, but were driven off by L√ºbbecke's townsfolk with support from the seneschal (Drost) of Limberg, Allhard von dem Busche. Attempts by Tecklenburg, to gain ownership of the castle were thus foiled. Reineberg Castle was turned into a strong fortress according to a contemporary account by the Minden cathedral canon, Tribbe, dating to the 15th century. Like almost all castles of this type the Reineburg was often enfeoffed due to its landlord's chronic shortage of money. Around 1525 we find Johann Tribbe as the seneschal of Reineburg. In 1543 the castle was enfeoffed to a widow, Clara of Hatzfeld, and her sons Meinolf and Joachim. Hardly had Bishop George come to power in 1554, when he issued the order to redeem all the enfeoffed castles in his diocese. This therefore also affected the then tenant, Hilmar von Quernheim. He wished to retain his fief however and was actually given an extension of several years until the bishop finally rescinded it in spring 1564. Because Hilmar von Quernheim did not respond, the bishop had the castle stormed on 2 May. But by 1567 Hilmar was again enfeoffed with the castle for twelve years following a treaty. During the Thirty Years' War the castle was badly damaged again and plundered three times: in 1636, 1638 and 1640. On 9 September 1636, Imperial Staff Sergeant (Oberwachtmeister) Heister, had the entire record office on the Reineberge burned. On 28 March 1673 M√ºnster troops captured L√ºbbecke and Reineberg in the course of the Franco-Dutch War, because Brandenburg was allied with the Netherlands. Then all fell quite around the old episcopal castle - the Principality of Minden being awarded to Brandenburg as part of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. In 1719, Frederick William I decreed the union of the County of Ravensberg with Minden, and this was followed, from 1723 to 1808, by the establishment of the Chamber of War and Estates (Kriegs- und Dom√§nenkammer) in Minden as a regional oversight of the administrations of the five Minden and eight Ravensberg districts or √Ñmter. The Reineburg was now enfeoffed several times together with its associated Amt and was under the command of the Prussian king, Frederick William I. In 1723 it was demolished due to its dilapidated condition. The remaining usable material was used in the construction of the government building in Minden and also for the new Amt office in the Reineberger Felde (called zum Siek), where several domestic buildings already existed. Finally the castle came under the general influence of the Bishop of Minden and became a Minden state castle or Landesburg. The fortifications in front of the castle show signs of medieval siege technology. The castle estate developed into the Minden Amt of Reineberg, which later became the Amt of H√ºllhorst. Of the rudimentary remains of this castle site only the castle moat is still visible on the summit. it is 310 metres long and between 15 and 22 metres wide.  Legend of the Reineberg  It is said of the Reineberg that the Saxon prince, Wittekind, who was suffering from leprosy, \\"came from the Limberge, reached the spring of Linderung on the western side, went from there to the Reineberg and was cleansed there. Whence the Reineberg received its name\\" (rein = pure, clean). In this spring is supposed to be an underground vault with a magic entrance in which \\"King Weking's silver cradle stands\\".  Today  Today the Reineberg falls within the borough of L√ºbbecke, but once belonged to the Amt of Reineberg, later H√ºllhorst. The old Amt of Reineberg or Amt Reineberger Feld existed from 1723 to 1807 and belonged to the Prussian Principality of Minden.Karl Heemeier: Das mindische Amt Reineberg im Spiegel von Bereisungsprotokollen des 18. Jahrhunderts. Mitteilungen des Mindener Geschichtsvereins Jahrgang 57 (1985), pp. 93-106. Even today the Reineberg is the name of a village in the collective municipality of H√ºllhorst south of the Wiehen Hills (Ahlsen-Reineberg). This municipality has a depiction of the Reineburg in its coat of arms. In 1951 an official survey of the visible remains of the castle was carried out. Local historian, Professor Langewische from B√ºnde, discovered that the Reineburg once had five outer baileys. From the southern edge of the town of L√ºbbecke, e. g. from the Waldstadion (stadium), the Reineberg may be reached on foot in 15‚Äì20 minutes. The parth around the Reinberg is about 1.1 kilometres long.  Gallery  File:Reineberg1 Falk Oberdorf.jpg|In the immediate vicinity of the summit a signpost points out the final section of the climb.

Specification The Standard for DTIs in North America is the ASTM International series of standards and the specific designation for testing and manufacturing DTIs is ASTM F959: Standard Specification for Compressible-Washer Type Direct Tension Indicators for Use with Structural Fasteners. DTIs are generally installed in accordance with the Research Council on Structural Connections Specification (RCSC) Specification for Structural Joints using High Strength Bolts. The RCSC Specification has been adopted, in its entirety, by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and appears as section 16 of that organization's Steel Construction Manual. DTIs within the RCSC Specification section 8.2.4 are described thus: \\"ASTM F959 direct tension indicators are recognized in this Specification as a bolt-tension-indicating device. Direct tension indicators are hardened washer shaped devices incorporating small arch-like protrusions on the bearing surface that are designed to deform in a controlled manner when subjected to compressive load.\\" Regarding the ASTM F959 manufacturing specification, the Abstract from the ASTM website describe DTIs as \\"capable of indicating the achievement of a specified minimum bolt tension in a structural bolt and are intended for installation under either a bolt head or a hardened washer. Steel materials used in the manufacture of direct tension indicators shall be designed, processed, heat treated, and protectively coated as specified. The direct tension indicators shall conform to required chemical composition, compression load, and dimensional values.\\" Like other fastener components, DTIs are covered by the Fastener Quality Act of 1999 in Section 3: Definitions (6) where a DTI is described as \\"a load-indicating washer, that is through- hardened‚Ä¶\\". Functioning DTIs are a function of induced tension. As a fastener assembly is tightened, the arch-like protrusions are compressed and the change in distance between the base of the protrusions of the DTI washer and the protrusion apex, correlates to a value of tensile force induced into the fastener. This distance can be verified by insertion of a tapered feeler gage between the protrusions to the bolt shank. The number of instances the bolt shank can be reached by the feeler gage is then compared to either the results of a pre-installation verification procedure or the manufacturer's instructions. A subset of the standard DTIs described above, is the \\"squirter\\" type DTI that contains a small amount of material in the cavity of each protrusion. \\"Squirter\\" type DTIs are mechanically and metallurgically identical to the standard DTIs described above, except that as the protrusions of squirter type DTIs collapse upon tightening, the cavity material is expelled to the outer diameter of the device, giving a visual indication of protrusion compression, i.e. bolt tension. While not approved by the ASTM or specifically mentioned within the RCSC specification, Squirter type DTIs are allowable because the RCSC specification requires all structural DTIs to conform the ASTM F959 standard whose reference documentation includes the ASME B18.2.6 standard. Since ASME B18.2.6 section 5.1 permits the inclusion of features to facilitate silicone emitting DTIs, squirter type DTIs are permissible and can be installed and inspected per the RCSC specification. Uses One of the more common uses of DTIs is in conjunction with EN 14399 pre-load bolt assemblies.

The first edition was published in 1937 and seven editions were eventually published by Partridge. An eighth edition was published in 1984, after Partridge's death, by editor Paul Beale; in 1990 Beale published an abridged version, Partridge's Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English.

The New York Times offered a \\"glowing\\" review\\"The Definitive Slang Dictionary\\", Ben Zimmer, The New York Times, April 1, 2011 of the 1937 first edition.\\"Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Slang\\", A. Dilworth Faber, The New York Times, May 23, 1937 Literary critic Edmund Wilson praised the dictionary, stating that the work \\"ought to be acquired by every reader who wants his library to have a sound lexicographical foundation\\". In 1985, John Gross of The New York Times called A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English \\"the nearest thing to a standard work in its field\\". In a 2002 review of the eighth edition, University College London Professor of English John Mullan argued that the \\"strength and weakness\\" of the dictionary was Partridge's \\"willingness to include his opinions [on word etymology] in what presented itself as a work of reference\\". However, Mullan also argued that by 2002 the dictionary entries were growing continually further out of date and out of touch with modern slang usages. In 1972, an abridgement (by Jacqueline Simpson) of the 1961 edition was published by Penguin Reference Books as A Dictionary of Historical Slang. Update following Partridge's death Following the seventh published edition of A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English in 1969, Eric Partridge had collected new material for another edition until his 1979 death. Prior to his death, Partridge \\"designated a successor\\", librarian\\"Would a hip, hip duck marry a gungy hunk?\\", Patrick Tivy, The Calgary Herald, June 12, 1985 and former military intelligence officer Paul Beale (who had contributed military slang to Partridge's efforts since 1974), and the lexicographical work was continued. The Eighth edition of A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English was published by Macmillan as a single-volume work in 1984. Beale also published in 1990 a condensed version of the dictionary, titled Partridge's Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English. Twenty-first century update In 2004, editors Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor published The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, a two-volume update of the dictionary. Dalzell and Victor were chosen by the publisher Routledge to update the Partridge dictionary; this edition is, however, completely new and unrelated to the previous versions. A concise edition was published in 2007. It has about 60,000 entries, and \\"contains every entry in New Partridge as well as several hundred new words that have come into the slang lexicon since 2005\\", but omits the extensive citations of the 2005 edition, thus coming bound in slightly over 700 pages of only one volume compared to over 4000 pages for the unabridged, two-volume edition.

Cassioli's design continued to inspire the obverse of the medal for many more years, though recreated each time, with the Olympic host and numeral updated. The trend ended in 2004 due to the negative publicity in reaction to the design of medal for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Wojciech Pietranik, the designer of the medal, along with the organisers of the Games were criticised by the Greek press for using the Roman Colosseum rather than the Greek Parthenon.

A development of the Grunau Baby, only two were built, flying with gliding clubs. Design and development The Cambridge first appeared as the Zander and Weyl Cambridge, making its first flight a few months before Zander and Weyl Ltd. changed its name to Dart Aircraft Ltd. Like the Slingsby Kite 1, the Cambridge was an updated version of the successful and influential Grunau Baby. It retained the Baby wing with its thick, high lift airfoil, though slightly increased in span, introduced a smoother monocoque fuselage, a tailplane of greater span and a new rudder. The wings of the Cambridge had a constant chord to about half span, outboard of which the leading edge was slightly swept and the trailing edge elliptically tapered. The ailerons were hinged on the outboard sections at a slight angle to the main spar, allowing them to be of almost constant chord. No flaps or airbrakes were fitted. The wings were mounted on a raised part of the fuselage just behind the cockpit, with single lift struts from the lower fuselage to the main spar at about one quarter span. The revised tailplane had swept leading edges and the elevators had forward-swept trailing edges, as on the Baby, but their extended span made it more pointed in plan. The fin was very narrow, with the rudder and elevator hinges at the same fuselage position. The rudder was almost semi-circular. The smooth plywood monocoque fuselage became more slender aft of the pylon carrying the wing. The cockpit was open. A combination of a single, short, fuselage-mounted skid and integral tail bumper served as an undercarriage. The Cambridge first flew on 1 December 1935. A second aircraft, known as the Cambridge 2, was a little lighter and had larger ailerons. Operational history The first Cambridge was owned by the Duke of Grafton, who was one of the founding members of the Cambridge University Gliding Club (CUGC). It was flown as a club aircraft and was entered by them into the 1939 National Soaring Contests, though without making much impression. It was registered by the club after World War II in the brief period from 1949 when UK gliders appeared on the CAA register. It was de- registered by CUGC in 1953, by which time gliders no longer required CAA registration. Its later history is uncertain; it was at RAF Dishforth for a while and may have been burnt before 1973. The Cambridge 2 was operated by the London Gliding Club who flew it into 6th place in the 1937 National Competitions, though it gained no prizes.

TIME magazine named Stott among the 100 most influential people in the world. The name 'Langham' derives from All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, where Stott was rector for 60 years. When he launched the original trust fund in 1969 from which the whole global fellowship has developed, he named it after that street ‚Äì 'The Langham Trust.' Although Stott was a Church of England clergyman, Langham Partnership is, and has been since its foundation, multi-denominational and multi-national. It operates through a wide network of Langham-related ministries, national members, and indigenous partners in more than 70 countries. These include: * seven supporting member countries (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, UK, Ireland, USA); four of which combined to constitute the Langham Partnership (international) in 2001, to support the three major ministries globally ‚Äì Langham Scholars, Langham Literature, and Langham Preaching * Langham Preaching movements established and developing in 70 countries * regional networks of leaders and trainers, established in Latin America and being developed elsewhere * the Fellowship of Langham Scholars, a total of about 350 men and women, including those currently studying for doctorates and those who have graduated and are in teaching and leadership roles throughout the world, strengthening evangelical theological education at multiple levels * major indigenous literature projects (such as regional language, multi- author, one-volume whole Bible commentaries) by teams in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eurasia. Langham Partnership has an international council (Langham Partnership International Council), a staff team (resident in several countries), along with a literature warehouse and Langham service facility in Carlisle, UK. There is no single international headquarters.  History  The roots of Langham Partnership extend to 1969 when John Stott had a strong desire to help Christian pastors in non-Western countries (where he was travelling widely) more fully understand the Bible so they could preach its messages more clearly to their own people. \\"He saw lots of Christians, but not enough teachers; lots of enthusiasm, but not enough erudition.\\" By dedicating the royalties from his (eventually more than 50) published books, Stott first established a fund he named Langham Trust (LT) to finance doctoral scholarships. In 1971, he founded the Evangelical Literature Trust (ELT) to provide books for students, pastors, and theological libraries in the Majority World. Both of these remained independent charities registered in the UK until, in 2001, Langham Partnership UK & Ireland was registered to amalgamate and replace the former LT and ELT). The objectives and work of the two original charities ‚Äì Langham Scholars and Langham Literature respectively ‚Äì continue within Langham Partnership. In 1974 Stott, with a group of friends, launched the Langham Foundation in the USA to encourage and enable people there to \\"help provide the resources needed to raise the standards of biblical preaching worldwide.\\" Around the same time, Langham networks were formed in Australia and Canada to help raise funds to support the ministries for which Stott advocated. In 1996, the name was changed in the USA to John Stott Ministries to capitalise on the public stature of its founder.) Considering the wishes expressed by Stott prior to his death in 2011, the John Stott Ministries board of directors changed the name to Langham Partnership USA in 2012. In 1999, as he approached his 80th birthday and contemplated the future of the ministries he had founded, John Stott wrote a \\"lengthy memorandum,\\" reflecting on their underlying vision. In it he articulated what is now known as the \\"Langham Logic\\"): # God wants his church to grow up in maturity (not just in numbers); # The church grows through God's Word, and # The Word of God comes to people primarily (though not exclusively) through biblical preaching. # Therefore, the logical response is to strive to raise the standards of biblical preaching so that the church may grow in maturity and fulfill its mission in the world. In 2002, after Stott had led seminars on biblical preaching in Latin America, convinced there was a need for pastors to be motivated, trained, and equipped in the skills of biblical preaching in a more direct, 'hands-on' way, Langham Preaching was inaugurated as a distinct third ministry of Langham Partnership alongside Scholars and Literature. The new ministry expanded through a growing network of indigenous leaders and regional coordinators, and by 2013, operates in 70 countries. In 2004, the first Langham Partnership Regional Consultation was held in Entebbe, Uganda, with representative advisors from around East Africa. Through a series of similar consultations around the world in the following years, regional development spread in 13 major continental regions. As local leadership and initiative was encouraged, regional coordinators were appointed in Latin America, Central America, Anglophone Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region. The Langham name, brand, vision and ministries are now 'owned' in a steadily growing number of countries. According to The Guardian newspaper, Langham Partnership is a \\"threefold initiative...to strengthen the church in the developing world by training preachers, funding doctoral scholarships for the most able theological thinkers, and providing basic, low-cost libraries for pastors.\\" Christianity Today called Langham Partnership \\"preeminent among the organizations [John Stott] launched.\\" \\"[Langham Partnership] particularly encourages biblical preaching by offering study books for pastors and libraries, by inspiring biblical preaching movements, and by offering doctoral scholarships for evangelical scholars who will commit to teaching in their home seminaries.\\" In 2006, the Africa Bible Commentary was published. Langham Literature and SIM were jointly involved in sponsoring this one volume commentary on the whole Bible written entirely by African authors for Africa. Langham has facilitated its translation into French, Portuguese, Swahili, and Malagasy. This publication in Africa has led Langham Literature to facilitate similar major projects for one-volume Bible commentaries in regional languages in Latin America, South Asia, the Middle East, and Eurasia. Another example of the work of Langham Partnership can be seen in the 2007 Langham Preaching training course on expository biblical preaching taken by 150 pastors in Nigeria. Since that initial event, the Nigerian movement has diversified to many different parts of the country, training thousands of pastors and lay preachers. In 2008, Langham Partnership merged with the Eastern Europe Literature Advisory Committee (EELAC). EELAC assisted Christian publishers in the former communist countries of Europe. Langham Literature continues that support, but has extended it in the form of publisher development in other parts of the world. As described on the International Christian College website (of Glasgow, Scotland): \\"John Stott was not only concerned with the church in the UK‚Ä¶. A number of international students coming to ICC over the years have been supported by the Langham Partnership, an initiative begun by Stott in 1969 in order to support church leaders from the Global South studying at UK universities. The ultimate aim was the building up of the church globally, with well trained, theologically literate leaders involved in the rapidly growing churches of the Global South.\\" In view of his influence through the Langham ministries, along with his many books, travels, and projects, and his acknowledged leadership of the evangelical movement worldwide, John Stott was described by church historian David Edwards as \\"apart from William Temple (who died as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1944) the most influential clergyman in the Church of England during the 20th century.\\" And with Langham Partnership and his other works, Stott \\"is credited with doing more to change the landscape of global evangelicalism in the twentieth century than any other evangelical.\\"  Activities  Langham Partnership operates three integrated international programs. Each of these has a director and a small number of dedicated staff, but much of the work is managed at national and regional levels, through teams of volunteer leaders, facilitators, trainers, writers, editors, etc. All three ministries are designed to be multiplicative by equipping those who, in turn, equip others. * Langham Preaching: Partners with national leaders to nurture indigenous biblical preaching movements for pastors and lay preachers. With the support of a team of trainers from many countries, an ongoing series of multi-level seminars provides practical training. This is followed by training local facilitators. Local preachers‚Äô groups and national and regional networks ensure continuity and ongoing development, seeking to build vigorous movements committed to Bible exposition. * Langham Literature: Provides majority world pastors, scholars and seminary libraries with evangelical [Wikipedia style is to capitalise Evangelical] books and electronic resources through grants, discounts and distribution. The ministry also fosters the creation of indigenous evangelical books for pastors in many languages, through training workshops for writers and editors, sponsored writing, translation, strengthening local evangelical publishing houses, and investment in major regional literature projects, such as one volume Bible commentaries like The Africa Bible Commentary, and fostering imprints such as Hippo Books * Langham Scholars: Provides financial support for evangelical doctoral students from the majority world so that, when they return home, they may train pastors and other Christian leaders with sound, biblical and theological teaching. The Langham Scholars ministry also works in partnership with majority world seminaries in strengthening evangelical theological education. A growing number of Langham Scholars study in high quality doctoral programs in the majority world itself. As well as teaching the next generation of pastors, graduated Langham Scholars exercise significant influence through their writing and leadership.

However, the global ministry says its emphasis is to work indigenously with Christians in Africa (20 countries), Asia (10 countries), Eurasia (3 countries), Europe (12 countries), Latin America (7 countries), the Pacific (4 countries), and the Caribbean (5 countries)), equipping leaders (indigenous pastors, scholars, writers and publishers) to effectively serve and equip others in their countries. In 2012, 21 indigenous Christian publishers produced 205,000 volumes, 39 local language titles and 60 locally authored titles.

Yepez was born in San Gabriel, Carchi, on January 17, 1940. Second son of Rodolfo Yepez and Otilia Obando, he was an outstanding student in his classrooms. Together with his two brothers he moved to Quito in 1954, where he first attended \\"Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a\\" High School, and later the Central University of Ecuador, where he gained his engineer degree in 1964. The University Council awarded him with a gold medal for his achievements and distinguished him with the title of \\"the best student of all times\\". Married with Genoveva Navarrete, he had two daughters, Vivian and Yarka. Since childhood and throughout his life, chess was his great passion. His father taught him the first lessons using an antique chess game inherited from his grandmother Amada Guerrero Paez. His passion grew bigger through the time while studying by himself the Grand Masters Games and the FIDE Informants, which eventually led him to achieve the National Chess Championship twice, on September 1968, and 1982, as well as the second place in the National Championship of November 1983. He was granted with the FIDE's title of National Master with a registered score of 2180.http://www.fide.com/.

During its existence, the Club organized some local tournaments with the best national chess players at the time, but finally it was closed due to lack of financial support. In his last days, while struggling against the hardships of his illness, he managed to play his last matches in bed, leaving a chess book on his night table marked in a certain page with a little chess horse just a few days before his death on August 2, 2010.

The novel grew out of a manuscript that Eugenides began after the publication of his sophomore Pulitizer Prize-winning novel, Middlesex. Eugenides has stated that he worked on the novel for about five or six years, and that portions are loosely based on his collegiate and post-collegiate experiences. The book is both a realist story about marriage and a postmodern, metafictional commentary on the kind of story it tells. The novel was well received by many critics, and was featured on year-end best of 2011 lists. Summary The story focuses on three college friends from Brown University ‚Äî Madeleine Hanna, Leonard Bankhead, and Mitchell Grammaticus ‚Äî beginning in their senior year, 1982, and subsequently follows them during their first year post-graduation.Eugenides, Jeffrey. The Marriage Plot. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. WorldCat  Characters  *Madeleine Hanna: An English major at Brown University and the daughter of affluent parents. During the course of the novel she is concerned with the writing of her undergraduate thesis, which revolves around the concept of \\"the marriage plot\\" in the 19th century novel. She is also ensnared in a love triangle of sorts with her classmates, Leonard Bankhead and Mitchell Grammaticus. *Leonard Bankhead: A Biology major with a side interest in Philosophy, who quickly becomes Madeleine's paramour. Following graduation Madeleine and Leonard move to Cape Cod where Leonard takes up postgraduate work at a biology lab. It is also noted that Leonard has Bi-Polar disorder and this informs many of his actions and thought processes throughout. *Mitchell Grammaticus: A Theology major who spends the majority of the novel lusting after spiritual truth and Madeleine. Following graduation, Mitchell and his classmate, Larry, embark on a lengthy tour of Europe and India. Development Eugenides began the novel after the publication of his novel Middlesex. He intended to write a ‚Äúmore tightly dramatized‚Äù novel than Middlesex, taking place over a year or several years, rather than 70. Originally, the plot concerned a debutante party, or a large family reunion, but after writing about the arrival of a daughter Madeleine to the party, he changed the plot to focus on her and her education. Certain aspects of the novel are autobiographical. Mitchell, like Eugenides, is Greek, was raised in Detroit, carried a briefcase in college, and traveled to India after his graduation. Eugenides has said that certain traits of Madeleine and Leonard are also drawn from his experience and personality. Eugenides chose to set the novel at Brown, his alma mater, after choosing not to set it at a fictional college, saying that it would have been \\"too much trouble for what it was worth\\". There is some debate as to whether the character Leonard is based on the author David Foster Wallace. Although Eugenides and Wallace were not friends, both were acquainted with Jonathan Franzen. Critics have pointed out that both Leonard and Wallace wear a bandana, chew tobacco, study philosophy, and struggled with mental illness. Furthermore, both the character and Wallace had an interest in time and the passage of time and at least some of Leonard's dialogue appears to have been directly lifted from an article about Wallace. Eugenides has denied that the character is based on Wallace and cited two inspirations for the bandana: that the practice was fairly common among his friends at Brown, and that he was basing Leonard off of \\"Guns N' Roses and heavy metal guys\\".  Literary connections  An oft-quoted work in the novel, particularly by Madeleine, is Roland's Barthes' seminal work A Lover's Discourse: Fragments. One scholar notes, \\"Barthes points out that, ‚ÄúThose who seek the proffering of the word (lyric poets, liars, wanderers) are subjects of Expenditure: they spend the word, as if it were impertinent (base) that it be recovered somewhere‚Äù (154). Moreover, ‚Äúno love is original,‚Äù being ‚Äúborn of literature, able to speak only with the help of its worn codes‚Äù. Reception Honors and awards The Guardian, Salon, NPR, and The Washington Post considered the novel to be one of the best books of 2011. It also received the 2011 Salon Book Award for FictionLaura Miller \\"The best fiction of 2011\\", \\"The best nonfiction of 2011\\" - Salon, December 8, 2011. and was featured on the Library Journal Best Books of the Year list. Critical reception As noted above, the novel was generally well received by critics. W. Deresiewicz wrote, \\"'The Marriage Plot' is a new departure...intimate in tone and scale.... It‚Äôs about what Eugenides‚Äôs books are always about, no matter how they differ: the drama of coming of age.... It possesses the texture and pain of lived experience.\\"William Deresiewicz, \\"Jeffrey Eugenides on Liberal Arts Graduates in Love,\\" The New York Times Book Review, October 16, 2011. C. Romano called it \\"the most entertaining campus novel since Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons.\\"Carlin Romano, \\"A Campus Novel about Leaving Campus Behind\\", Chronicle of Higher Education September 4, 2011. However, reviews of the novel were not without criticism; Eleanor Barkhorn, writing for The Atlantic, praised the heroine Madeleine as \\"smart\\" and in many other ways realistic, but nonetheless criticized the novel for its lack of \\"believability\\" in depicting a modern female character whose \\"relationships [with almost all other women] are characterized more by spite than affection\\".Eleanor Barkhorn, \\"What Jeffrey Eugenides Doesn't Understand About Women\\", The Atlantic October 12, 2011. Barkhorn noted that the book is not unique in this manner, making reference to The Bechdel Test and stating that The Marriage Plot was a prime example of the storytelling trend the Test criticizes: \\"[t]here are countless other Madeleines in modern-day literature and film: smart, self-assured women who have all the trappings of contemporary womanhood except a group of friends to confide in\\". Barkhorn also compared the book to the early female authors of the literary genre that Eugenides references in both the novel and its title, opining that writers such as Charlotte Bront√´ and Jane Austen, in depicting close homosocial relationships among women, were more psychologically accurate than Eugenides. She suggested that Madeleine's lack of such relationships was implausible in context (\\"If this were the way women really acted with their friends, it would be fine. [...] But real women don't treat their friends this way,\\" \\"Women who love books, as Madeleine does, are especially prone to close friendships with other women [...] [i]t seems impossible that Madeleine would have made it through four years at Brown without meeting other women who'd rather discuss literature than men\\"), and further suggested that this aspect was detrimental to the book, declaring the plot's conclusion to be an \\"infuriating, preposterous ending\\" that \\"is only possible because Madeleine lives almost entirely in her own head, with no one to give her trusted counsel\\" and further adding that \\"[t]here are many ways rewriting the traditional marriage plot might be good for women, but editing out rich, supportive friendships isn't one of them\\".

A certification process is mandatory to market products as Healthy Grown. Through this program, growers implement on-farm conservation to improve biodiversity and restore native ecosystems on unfarmed parcels of land. All implemented practices are research-based by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and are found to be economically viable and ecologically sound and are supported by various non-governmental organizations. This whole-farm approach takes into consideration practices that consider water quality and soil erosion and has led to a reduced use of nutrients and pesticides. The goals of the Healthy Grown program as set forth in the approved Memorandum of Understanding include: *Promotion of IPM practices *Reduced utilization of risky pesticides *Improvement of ecosystem biodiversity *Articulated measurement systems of IPM *Increased marketplace incentives Healthy Grown was branded in 2001 by the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association (WPVGA) after collaborations lead to the development of an eco-label for biointensive IPM (bioIPM) grown potatoes set in 2000. The eco-standard for potatoes is divided into three parts: 1) a bioIPM section, 2) a toxicity score, and 3) a natural community standard. In 2001, over 4000 acres became certified for the program, and about 5000 acres meet the certification standard and are labeled as Healthy Grown. Collaborators The Healthy Grown Program began as the Wisconsin Eco-Potato collaboration in 1996 that included a group of Wisconsin potato growers, the WPVGA, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). In 2004, The WPVGA and Defenders of Wildlife signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) listed above. Parameters for certification A third party organization, Protected Harvest, audits and certifies all Healthy Grown growers, packers, and shippers each year for sustainable agriculture standards. The audit examines documentation of pesticide records, conservation efforts, and location of growth and distribution of product. Standards include the use of an IPM strategy and use of alternative pesticides than those found the list that include chemicals with high toxicity scores and typically include organophosphate, carbamate, and other product families that have human health risk and endocrine disruption in wildlife. Resistance management strategies include a limited list of allowable pesticides, which reduces the likelihood of resistance development. In addition, accumulated toxicity levels are monitored for long and short season crops. IPM management recommendations for the production system are provided by the University of Wisconsin Research and Extension. The certification program expanded in 2006 to include a Natural Community Standard which constitute science-based approaches that help implement restoration for native wetland, oak savanna, and native prairie communities on privately owned non-agricultural lands on grower farms. Such habitats promote species such as the Karner Blue Butterfly, Sandhill cranes, prairie chickens, and other species that are at risk. Land on Healthy Grown farms are evaluated in the context of the regional ecosystem and are chosen based on the following parameters: *The site fits within the local and regional conservation objectives *The site contains remnants of native plant communities or is suitable for restoration of native plant communities *The landowner has no plans for development or other use of the site *Restoration on the site will be economically sustainable Recognition *USDA Secretary‚Äôs Honor Awards for Maintaining and Enhancing the Nation‚Äôs Natural Resources and Environment *World Wildlife Fund Gift to the Earth Award *International IPM Award of Achievement *International Crane Foundation Good Egg Award for Excellence Expansion of Program In 2010, the Healthy Grown initiative was expanded into other crops. This model considers sustainability on multi-crop farms and provides modules for each specific crop grown. In 2011, crop modules for fresh potatoes, processed green beans, and carrots entered pilot testing. In 2012, modules for sweet corn, peas, soybeans, and field corn will be tested.

The film was directed by and starred Lowell Sherman, along with Mary Astor and Anthony Bushell. The screenplay was adapted by J. Walter Ruben based on the 1928 play by Robert E. Sherwood titled The Queen's Husband. It would be one of a handful of RKO pictures which was produced in both English and French language versions. Plot Nance O'Neill and Lowell Sherman Mary Astor and Hugh Trevor Princess Anne (Mary Astor) plans to run away with Freddie Granton (Anthony Bushell), the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII (Lowell Sherman), once her domineering mother, Queen Martha (Nance O'Neil), has left for a vacation in America. Anne is therefore aghast when the Marquis of Birten (Alan Roscoe) brings news that he has negotiated her political marriage to Prince William of Grec (Hugh Trevor), a man she has never even met. Dismissing Anne's vehement protests, the Queen is delighted, a feeling not shared by Anne's loving but ineffectual father. Meanwhile, the Premier and General Northrup (Robert Warwick) warn that a revolution is brewing. He wishes to execute large numbers of political prisoners, but cannot without the King's signature. The Queen wholeheartedly approves of these stern measures. The King promises to attend to it, but after Northrup and the Queen leave, he orders his secretary to misplace the death warrants. Led by Laker (Carrol Naish), the rebels rise up after Northrup gets Parliament to grant him dictatorial powers. Anne seizes the opportunity to try to flee with Granton, with her father's approval. However, when she believes that the King is in real danger, she refuses to leave him. Doctor Fellman (Frederick Burt), a moderate rebel leader, comes to see the King to demand his abdication, but agrees to stop the fighting in favor of negotiation. Then Northrup insists he is in charge now and laughs in derision when the King claims the people are stronger than Northrup's army and navy. Next to arrive is Prince William. Despite his admission that he dislikes Anne, he is prepared to do his duty and go through with the wedding. Then Fellman and Laker show up. The King surprises Northrup by dismissing him from his service and putting Fellman in charge, ordering him to set up general elections as soon as possible. The Queen, newly returned from America with a much-needed loan, tells her husband in private that she knew the whole revolution was a bluff to force Northrup from power. The King has one last deception planned (of which she is unaware). After she leaves for the wedding, he has Granton brought to him. He speedily marries Anne and Granton and sends them on their way to \\"exile\\" in France.

Sherwood (although The Film Daily incorrectly attributed the play to No√´l Coward), and disclosed that Sherman would direct and star in the project. William LeBaron, head of production for RKO Radio Pictures, had purchased the rights to Sherwood's play during his trip to New York in early September. Later in the month, Emery's involvement in the film was announced in \\"an important role\\". In early October, Nance O'Neil's attachment in the role of the Queen was reported, with Mary Astor's involvement as the Princess announced the week later. Robert Warwick was loaned from Fox, who pulled him out of the cast of Once a Sinner prior to production, to play the role of Northrup on October 15. In mid-October, it was reported that United Artists would handle the distribution of the French version of the film, in French-speaking countries. Using an all-French cast, that version was scheduled for release on November 30. The complete cast for the French version, being shot at the RKO lot in Hollywood, was announced at the beginning of November. On October 21 the final cast was announced, as well as J. Walter Ruben as the writer in charge of the screenplay adaptation, and Arthur Roberts signed on as the editor. The film was already in production by this time at RKO's studio in Hollywood. In November 1930 it trade paper accounts announced that the name of the film was being changed from The Queen's Husband to The Royal Bed. Reception Photoplay complimented the plot, dialogue and acting, calling it a \\"fine talkie,\\" while The Modern Screen Magazine said it was \\"... an amusing story ...\\". The Film Daily lauded the directing and the acting, stating that the film was an \\"Excellent satirical comedy\\", and said \\"The subtle but sure-fire humor of Lowell Sherman and the superb acting of Nance O'Neil are the outstanding features of this fine production\\". The magazine also complimented the French version of the play. Motion Picture Magazine liked the picture, calling it \\"Clever Satire - Cleverly Done\\", and they especially enjoyed Sherman's acting. Jack Grant of Motion Picture News gave the film high praise, titling it \\"Delightful Sophistry\\". He complimented the entire cast saying that it \\"... could hardly be improved upon\\", singling out the performances of Astor, Sherman, O'Neil, Warwick, and Emery. Grant also enjoyed Sherman's direction. Overall he described the picture \\"As simon-pure entertainment for intelligent audiences this talker has few equals in this class.\\" Notes In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. See Note #60, pg. 143 The Royal Bed was also produced by LeBaron in a French-language version entitled Echec Au Roi, directed by L√©on D'Usseau and Henri de la Falaise, with a translation of Ruben's screenplay into the French language by Robert Harari. Leo Tover was the cinematographer on this film as well, which starred Fran√ßoise Rosay, Pauline Garon and Emile Chautard. At both the Los Angeles and Chicago screenings, the film was titled, Le Roi s'Ennuie. As reported in The Hollywood Reporter, a radio version of this film aired on December 30, 1935. The play on which this film is based, The Queen's Husband by Robert E. Sherwood, was performed at the Playhouse Theatre in New York City from January through May 1928. It was produced by William A. Brady and Dwight Deere Wiman and directed by John Cromwell. It starred Roland Young as King Eric, Gladys Hanson as The Queen, Katherine Alexander as Princess Anne, and Gyles Isham as Freddie Granton.

The fourth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Don formed from an area of low pressure along a tropical wave, Don developed into a tropical depression on July 27, and on that same day, was upgraded to tropical storm intensity, based on data from a reconnaissance aircraft noted the presence of tropical-storm- force winds. It tracked across the Gulf of Mexico and reached a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) before moving ashore in Texas on July 30 as a tropical depression, dissipating shortly afterwards. Initially, Don was expected to provide relief to the state, which was suffering from a major drought. However, the system dissipated rapidly just before making landfall, providing very little in the way of help to the state; rainfall totals were less than 1 in (25 mm). Meteorological history The genesis of Tropical Storm Don was from a tropical wave first identified off the west coast of Africa on July 16. It tracked westward over the open Atlantic for several days, with minimal convection confined to the monsoon trough. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the potential for gradual tropical cyclogenesis on July 21, when it was positioned about 750 mi (1200 km) to the east of the Windward Islands. As the system moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 23, it produced tropical-storm-force winds in Puerto Rico. The combination of vertical wind shear and the wave's proximity to land impeded further development. Convection increased along the northern portion of the wave on July 24, although by the following day the NHC expected no significant redevelopment. Early on July 26, the thunderstorms along the tropical wave became more concentrated to the south of Cuba, in association with a low- pressure area. The system continued to organize, and by 0600 UTC on July 27, the surface circulation became defined enough for it to be classified as a tropical depression about 60 mi (95 km) northeast of Canc√∫n, Mexico. Within twelve hours, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Operationally, the system was not known to be a tropical cyclone until 2100 UTC on July 27, after a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system confirmed the presence of a closed, albeit elongated, circulation center. At that point, the NHC classified it as Tropical Storm Don. Upon forming, the storm moved to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level ridge over the northern Gulf of Mexico. Due to generally favorable conditions, including warm waters and light to moderate wind shear, the NHC predicted steady intensification to winds of at least 65 mph (100 km/h). However, none of the tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated much strengthening. Initially, Don failed to intensify significantly due to a misalignment between the lower and mid-level circulations. The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July 28, although the winds increased slightly. Early on July 29, Don attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) as reported by the Hurricane Hunters, and the storm maintained that intensity while moving across the Gulf of Mexico. As Don approached the Texas coast early on July 30, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler water temperatures just offshore. The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230 UTC on July 30\\\\. About three and a half hours later, Don degenerated into a remnant low, and the circulation dissipated six hours after that. Preparations and impact Rainfall image of Don by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission The state civil protection agency in Quintana Roo warned that the tropical wave from which Don formed was capable of dropping of rainfall over the state, while producing sustained winds of and gusts up to . After Don was designated as a tropical storm, the Yucat√°n state government issued a green-level alert. The alert indicated that although the tropical storm was located close to the state, it was only considered to be slightly dangerous. Late on July 27, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass in Texas. Six hours later, the tropical storm watch was extended southwards to the international border. After the storm was named, officials in Texas began making preparations for Don. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don, and city officials began preparing for a possible evacuation. On July 27, oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non-essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don. The next day, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum and Apache Corporation announced the evacuations of some of the oil facilities in the area, while ExxonMobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike. Several oil companies stopped oil production as a result of Don; by midday on July 28, 6.8% of oil production and 2.8% of natural gas production in the Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm. Due to its abrupt weakening prior to landfall, Don produced minimal rainfall, with totals of less than . However, Bay City, Texas, located well northeast of where the storm made landfall, reported . In southern Texas, the rains resulted in slippery roads and some ponding. Cotton farmers benefited from what rains that did fall as they harvested their crop. Winds during Don's passage were minimal, with a peak wind gust of at Waldron Field. In addition, Don moved ashore with a storm surge that peaked at about at Bob Hall Pier. There were no reports of damage.

The extant works of Borg reveal practically nothing in terms of biographical data. What they do attest to is his philosophical prowess and his clarity of thought. Known works Only three works of Dominic Borg are known to exist. Two on rhetoric and one on logic. Others might have been lost or are currently displaced. Rhetoric Borg‚Äôs De Arte Rethorica: Brevis Notitia (A Short Note on the Art of Rhetoric), a work in Latin completed in 1668, is held in manuscript form at the National Library of Malta as MS. 718#10. It is his most relevant extant work to date. The manuscript is made up of forty folios, and is compiled as part of a miscellaneous volume of works. Basically, Borg‚Äôs manuscript is a study of rhetoric, and is composed as a series of epistles. The first epistle is an investigation into the teachings of Aristotle. Throughout all of the epistles, Borg makes liberal use of Cicero. Another extant work on rhetoric from Borg‚Äôs hand is Compendio Brevissimo delli piu inutili precetti per comporre epistola (A Very Short Collection on the Minute Rules for Writing Epistles), composed in 1668. This manuscript is also in Latin, and is held at the National Library of Malta as MS. 718#11). It contains only twelve folios, and is organised in chapters (some of which are divided into smaller parts). The work investigates the nature of epistles, and the proper manner with which epistles should be composed. The work is not particularly speculative. It is more of a short and technical exercise in rhetoric. Again, Cicero is quoted profusely. Logic Borg‚Äôs work on logic is called Brevis Introductio ad Logicam Artis (A Brief Introduction to the Art of Logic), composed in 1669. The manuscript is in Latin, and held at the National Library of Malta as MS. 718#2. This work is made up of just sixteen folios, and is actually a very simple piece of writing where Borg examines the various distinctions of logic. The composition is divided under various sub- titles.

Train service on Branch Line Saratoga Springs to North Creek discontinued until June 18, 1955\\" Regular service having entirely ended by 1957, with only freight service remaining.'Official Guide of the Railways,' December 1957, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 3'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1958, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 3 In 1998, the line was purchased by Warren County with plans to operate an excursion train to improve tourism and economic development in the area. In 1999, the Upper Hudson River Railroad began operating excursion trains south from North Creek to Riverside Station in Riparius. The Upper Hudson River Railroad lost their contract with Warren County on December 31, 2010, ending 11 years of operation. On April 8, 2011, it was announced that Iowa Pacific Holdings (IPH) would take over operation of the route effective July 1, 2011. As part of the agreement, IPH agreed to operate a minimum of 182 tourist- oriented passenger trains over the line. IPH began operating trains on July 14, 2011, as the Saratoga and North Creek Railroad. Unlike the Upper Hudson River Railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek operated over the entire between Saratoga Springs, New York and North Creek. With the creation of the Saratoga and North Creek Railway, regularly scheduled service returns to the line for the first time since the D&H; ceased freight operations on November 17, 1989. On May 14, 2012, IPH received permission from the Surface Transportation Board to restore freight service on the derelict north end of the line as far as Newcomb. Freight service began on the line in February 2013. On August 2, 2013, the rear locomotive of an SNCRR train derailed in Thurman. No injuries were reported, but the railroad was closed temporarily to allow for repairs. On April 3, 2018, plans were announced to shut down the railway line due to financial losses. The final tourist train rain on April 7. The future of the railway line itself is uncertain; the organization Protect the Adirondacks has called for the conversion of the railway line into a rail trail. Four bids for purchasing the line for passenger and freight service were placed in 2019.https://www.adirondackexplorer.org/explorer_reports/bids-requested-on- rail-line-to-north-creek  Passenger service  Regularly scheduled service ran once each day Friday through Monday from July 1 to October 31 and on Saturdays and Sundays during the fall and spring. The trip took 2 hours and 12 minutes. A separate service, the Snow Train, ran on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays during the winter. Unlike the summer trains, the Snow Train had two trains each day in both directions. Railbike tours In 2016, plans were floated for 3-hour pedal-powered railbike tours on a 10-mile section of unused railroad tracks between Moose Pond Club Road and North Creek. The tours opened in July 2017 using two and four-person pedal-powered railbikes. Starting from the North Creek rail depot, tourists are driven to North River, where they pedal north for three miles along a fairly flat route which includes crossing the Hudson River on a trestle before returning on the same route. The trip takes about two hours each way. The tours are operated by Revolution Rail, which pays the railway to use the line. The North End Local runs a shorter route between Thurman and North Creek twice a day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays in July and August. All other trains run the full length of the line between Saratoga Springs and North Creek.

It was established as the northernmost terminus for a mutually agreed upon boundary line between the Choctaw and Creek peoples during the Mississippi Territory period. This boundary line, now known as the ‚ÄúOld Indian Treaty Boundary,‚Äù starts at the Alabama River cut-off in southernmost Clarke County and follows a northward path through the county along the drainage divide between the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers to the Choctaw Corner, then turns ninety degrees to the west and follows the modern county-line between Clarke and Marengo to the Tombigbee River. History Beginning a decade prior to the eruption of the Creek War, the Choctaw Corner had its roots in white settlement of territory that the Creek saw as encroachment upon their western lands. They had already experienced white encroachment on their eastern lands in Georgia. The Choctaw claimed the lands in modern Clarke County from the Tombigbee River eastward to the watershed as theirs. Although the Creek had traditionally claimed the lands from the Alabama River westward to the watershed, as early as 1802 the Alibamu people, as the closest members of the Creek Confederacy to the new settlers, claimed that their territory reached all the way across to the Tombigbee. Historical marker detailing the history of the Choctaw Corner. After much persuasion, veiled threats, and a payment of $50,000 plus an annuity in goods of $3000, the Choctaw signed the Treaty of Mount Dexter with the United States on November 16, 1805 that ceded 4,142,720 acres (16,765.0 km2) of their territory, including the disputed land east of the Tombigbee, to the Americans. In about 1808 the two Native American peoples decided to settle their argument over control of the strip of land between the two rivers by a traditional ball game. The Choctaw won but the Creek were dissatisfied with the results. The two groups decided to let the women play, and the Choctaw women won as well, which settled the dispute. Possibly disappointed that the treaty did not include the fertile lands on the east bank of the Mississippi River, President Thomas Jefferson had delayed ratification in the Senate for over two years after the signing. The boundary line was finally surveyed in 1809, with both Creek and Choctaw assisting. Several years after the Indian Removal in the 1830s, European-American settlers founded a new town named Choctaw Corner a few miles southeast of the old boundary marker.

William H. Hand Jr., a renowned yacht designer, drew the plans for James W. Hall of New York City. The vessel's original name was the \\"Princess Pat,\\" which is a sailor's song of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Unit, currently stationed in Edmonton, Alberta. The schooner is a 79-foot (length overall) half-scale model of a 19th-century Grand Banks fishing vessel. James W. Hall promptly sold the Princess Pat to Alphonsus Reybine, according to title records. After Reybine‚Äôs death, executor Martha Reynine sold it to T. Sloan Young in 1929. Young changed the name to ‚ÄúSaispas,‚Äù from the French ‚ÄúJe ne sais pas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù The boat participated in the 1930 Newport- Bermuda Race under Young's ownership. The vessel placed last, sailing alongside such other notable schooners of her era such as the John Alden- designed \\"Malabar X\\". Roger W. Randall bought \\"Hindu\\" from Young. Nowell Ames bought her from Randall. Both sales happened in 1935. Nowell changed the boat's name to ‚ÄúAnna Lee Ames,‚Äù before selling her to William A. Parker in 1938. Parker used the boat to trade spices between India and Boston from 1938-1940, and christened her ‚ÄúHindu.‚Äù The U.S. Navy commissioned \\"Hindu\\" during World War II, where she assisted the Coastal Patrol along the Eastern Seaboard. Log books indicate the navy men painted her gray, lined her with depth charges, mounted a machine gun on her deck and engaged a German U-boat on more than one occasion. Archie A. Comstock owned the boat after the war for a short time before he sold it to Albert \\"Al\\" Avellar Jr. and partners in 1946. Capt. Al Avellar of Provincetown, MA bought \\"Hindu\\" in 1946 and began sailing her as a passenger vessel there.Albert Avellar Obituary Avellar eventually pioneered the whale watching industry in 1947 with what is purportedly the first trip on the eastern seaboard.The First Whale Watch The boat changed hands a few times in the 1980s before a man named John Bennett became the owner. Bennett died aboard the boat and the schooner fell into disrepair. Capt. Kevin \\"Foggy\\" Foley of Cape Cod and partners bought her in 2006. Then in his late 50s, Foley had sailed aboard \\"Hindu\\" as crew when he was 12 years old. Foley spent a year rebuilding the Hindu in East Boothbay with the help of friends and family. She was used in the production of two Daniel Adams films that take place on Cape Cod: The Golden Boys in 2008 and The Lightkeepers in 2009. Fairwinds Credit Union acquired \\"Hindu\\" in 2009. William Rowan bought the schooner in 2011. The vessel is docked at the Key West Bight Marina, in Old Town Key West. The schooner spends its year split between Key West, Florida in the winters and Provincetown, Massachusetts in the summers, going on regular day sails and sunset cruises.

Hallett House is located on West Francis Avenue in Aspen, Colorado, United States. It is a timber frame structure built in the late 19th century. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was originally a log cabin built by one of the miners who came to Aspen in its earliest years of settlement, during the Colorado Silver Boom. Samuel I. Hallett, who later expanded it, was an officer of the Smuggler Mine, one of Aspen's largest and most lucrative. When its owners renovated it in the mid-20th century, they discovered the remnants of the original log cabin. Since then it has been through multiple owners, and remains a private residence. Building The house is located at the northeast corner of West Francis and North Fourth streets in Aspen's residential West End. All the neighboring properties are houses, generally of a more modern construction. Many are surrounded by mature trees. The land is generally level, midway between the slopes of Aspen Mountain to the south and the Roaring Fork River to the north. A stone mounting block with the name \\"Hallett\\" on it is located at the street. The building itself occupies a narrow lot ending at the alley in the middle of the block. It has a one-and-a-half-story L-shaped front- gabled main block, sided in clapboard and topped with a shingled roof. A short cross-gabled section projects from the east side, with a longer cross-gable at the northwest corner. North of the house is a rear outbuilding, in a style similar to the main house. On the three sides of the main block is a wraparound porch. It has a shed roof supported by square wooden pillars that rise from the tiled deck. Fenestration on the first floor consists of narrow casement and one-over-oine double-hung sash windows. Fish-scale shingles side the gable apexes. History Aspen was incorporated as a city in 1879, when it was just a few tents and log cabins. By 1885 the Colorado Silver Boom was underway, and the city was growing rapidly. It is believed that a man named Thomas Anson built the original log cabin that year although some sources date the original construction to 1888, three years later. Two years later the cabin was purchased by Samuel I. Hallett and his wife. He had just arrived in Aspen from the Black Hills of South Dakota, and found his mining experience there in high demand in his new home. Soon he became superintendent of the Smuggler Mine northeast of the city, and secretary of several other major mines. In 1892 the Halletts decided to remodel the old log cabin into a house more befitting someone of his stature in town. Clapboard siding, similar to that seen on most of Aspen's larger house, went up over the logs. The city's prosperity abruptly ended the next year when Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in response to the Panic of 1893. The silver market contracted, mines closed and miners left for more promising opportunities elsewhere. Nonetheless, the house remained in the Hallett family until 1935. It is not known whether any work was done during the city's \\"quiet years\\" of the early 20th century. The next known renovation after Hallett's took place in the late 1940s, when new owners acquired the property. They removed the walls and found the original logs beneath. A cast bronze fireplace with bas- relief designs in the downstairs bedroom is the only other remnant of the original house. City records show that a bed and bath were added in 1953, and the one-story frame bathroom wing in 1960. The front porch and roof were repaired seven years later. There have been no other significant changes to the house.

He was a member of the United National Party of Sri Lanka. Early life Shirley Corea was born in Chilaw. His father was the illustrious Sri Lankan freedom fighter Charles Edgar Corea who was elected President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. He was the nephew of another famed Sri Lankan freedom fighter, Victor Corea who was a founder member of the Ceylon National Congress. Shirley Corea grew up in this political world. His father and uncle founded the Chilaw Association and campaigned for independence from the British Raj. When Mahatma Gandhi, the 'Father of India' visited Ceylon in 1927, he travelled to Chilaw and was the Chief Guest at a banquet in a Corea home called 'Sigiriya.' Shirley Corea met Mahatma Gandhi in 1927. He first won the parliamentary seat of Chilaw in 1952 and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Trade, Commerce & Fisheries by Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. In 1954 he was appointed as Minister of Trade, Commerce & Fisheries by Prime Minister John Kotelawala. In 1956 he lost it. in the House of Representatives in the Parliament of Ceylon. In both 1960 elections he didn't contest the seat. In 1965 he contested the Chilaw electorate was elected, and subsequently appointed as Deputy Speaker. Corea was elected Speaker on the death of Sir Albert Peries in 1967. Corea went on to enjoy a distinguished record as Speaker from 1967 - 1970. In 1970 election he lost. He was highly respected for being fair when it came to parliamentary debates in the chamber. During his tenure as Speaker, Shirley's Corea's official residence was the spacious 'Mumtaz Mahal' in Colombo. Education The young Shirley Corea was educated at Royal College, Colombo. Shirley Corea was educated at Royal College Colombo where he excelled in school debates and he served as Secretary of the Royal College Social Service League - he was a founder member. He joined the Ceylon Law College and passed out as a Proctor of the Supreme Court of Ceylon in 1932. He practised in Chilaw and extended his much sought legal carrier in Kuliyapitiya, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Mannar, Vavuniya and Maho; once he was retained in a case to defend the late Mr. Eddie Jayamanne husband of the famous Sri Lankan actress, Rukmani Devi and personalities from the world of Sri Lankan cinema in a Madras Court, in India. Corea was a well known trial lawyer on the island of Sri Lanka. The Coat of Arms of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Shirley Corea was Speaker from 27 September 1967 - 25 March 1970 Political career Milton Weerasinghe, writing in the 'Island' newspaper in Sri Lanka, noted that 'his distinguished law career was disturbed in 1952 when the constituents of Chilaw made a request to him to contest the Chilaw Parliamentary Seat on the U.N.P. Ticket; Mr. Corea did win it and he was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary (Junior Minister) to late R.G. Senanayake, Minister of Trade Commerce and Fisheries, on Mr. Senanayake‚Äôs resignation, Mr. Corea was appointed the Minister of Trade Commerce and Fisheries by late Sir John Kotelawala, Prime Minister of Ceylon. Mr. Corea was re-elected to Chilaw seat in the House of Representatives in 1965 and appointed the Deputy Speaker and the Chairman of Committees in the Dudley Senanayake government and was elected Speaker in 1967 after the death of Sir. Albert F Peries. ' Chilaw 'The Island' newspaper observed: 'Mr. Corea has done many development work in his electorate; he always gave priority to Society and not for the particular individual, in Chilaw electorate Yoda-Ela Scheme in Karawita, Sengal-Oya Scheme; development of Karukupone and Udappuwa fishing villages; Transport Services; Education; Health are the few priorities he had. Chilaw Bauddha Mandiraya would not have been, if not for Mr. Corea‚Äôs afforts [sic], there were a lot of obstructions from Judges, lawyers and many others as this building is just adjacent to the District Court of Chilaw, but Mr. Corea was successful and laid the foundation by the late William Gopallawa, Governor General of Ceylon; for this act Dr. A. D. V. Premaratne; Messrs. Sirisena Weerasuriya, Sirisoma and N. M. Gnanalankara gave their utmost support to him to make this venture a success; it is also unforgetable [sic] the services he rendered to the Ananda College of Chilaw. Mr. Corea was also the Patron of Chilaw District Boy Scout Local Association and in many other social service organisations. ' He was the Chairman of Chilaw Puttalam Planters‚Äô Association, Chilaw Negombo Rotary Club and many times, the President of Chilaw Sports Club, Commonwealth Association, a delegate to the World Peace Through the Rule of Law and President of Law Society of Ceylon. Mr. Corea was a very close associate of Asia Foundation representative in Sri Lanka Mr. James H. Nayes and obtained much assistance to his electorate.

Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society, Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C. Jacob, James R. Jacob, 2008, 908 pages, p.261/262, Google Books webpage: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKGgoNo4un0C&pg=PA261&lpg;=PA261 BooksG-kK]. \\"Medieval Philosophy\\" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), plato.stanford.edu, 2004, webpage: PS. The Recovery of Aristotle spanned about 100 years, from the middle 12th century into the 13th century, and copied or translated over 42 books (see: Corpus Aristotelicum), including Arabic texts from Arabic authors, where the previous Latin versions had only two books in general circulation: Categories and On Interpretation (De Interpretatione). Translations had been due to several factors, including limited techniques for copying books, lack of access to the Greek texts, and few people who could read ancient Greek, while the Arabic versions were more accessible. The recovery of Aristotle's texts is considered a major period in medieval philosophy, leading to Aristotelianism. \\"Cambridge Histories Online\\" (Later Medieval Philosophy), John F. Wippel, 1982, Overview, cambridge.org, 2011, webpage: HC22. Because some of Aristotle's newly translated views discounted the notions of a personal God, immortal soul, or creation, various leaders of the Catholic Church were inclined to censor those views for decades, such as lists of forbidden books in the Condemnations of 1210‚Äì1277 at the University of Paris. Meanwhile, Thomas Aquinas (c.1225‚Äì1274), at the end of that time period, was able to reconcile the viewpoints of Aristotelianism and Christianity, primarily in his work, Summa Theologica (1265‚Äì1274).  Background  In the Early Middle Ages, some Muslim scholars had translated Aristotle's ancient-Greek writings into the Arabic language. They had also written commentaries about those writings. The preservation of ancient Greek ideas was a major contribution of Islamic civilization. In the 4th century, the Roman grammarian Marius Victorinus translated two of Aristotle's books, about logic, into Latin: the Categories and On Interpretation (De Interpretatione). A little over a century later, most of Aristotle's logical works, except perhaps for the Posterior Analytics, had been translated by Boethius, c. 510‚Äì512 (see: Corpus Aristotelicum). However, only Boethius's translations of the Categories and On Interpretation had entered into general circulation before the 12th century. All in all, only a few major works of Aristotle were never translated into Arabic. Of these, the fate of Politics in particular remains uncertain. The rest of Aristotle's books were eventually translated into Latin, but over 600 years later, from about the middle of the 12th century. First, the rest of the logical works were finished, by using the translations of Boethius as the basis. Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy, Edward Craig, 1998, p.396, webpage: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ- GhVWTH84C&pg=PA396&lpg;=PA396 BooksG-GhV]. Then came the Physics, followed by the Metaphysics (12th century), and Averroes' Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics (13th century), so that all works were translated by the mid-13th century. A text like On the Soul, for instance, was unavailable in Latin in Christian Europe before the middle of the twelfth century.Sander Wopke de Boer, The Science of the Soul: The Commentary Tradition on Aristotle's De Anima, C. 1260‚Äì1360, Leuven : Leuven University Press, 2013, p. 15. The first Latin translation is due to James of Venice (12th century), and has always been considered as the translatio vetus (ancient translation).Sander Wopke de Boer, The Science of the Soul: The Commentary Tradition on Aristotle's De Anima, C. 1260‚Äì1360, Leuven : Leuven University Press, 2013, p. 16. The second Latin translation (translatio nova, new translation) was made from the Arabic translation of the text around 1230, and it was accompanied by Averroes's commentary; the translator is generally thought to be Michael Scot. James's translatio vetus was then revised by William of Moerbeke in 1266‚Äì7, and became known as the \\"recensio nova\\" (new recension), which was the most widely read version.Sander Wopke de Boer, The Science of the Soul: The Commentary Tradition on Aristotle's De Anima, C. 1260‚Äì1360, Leuven : Leuven University Press, 2013, pp. 15‚Äì16. On the Soul ended up becoming a component of the core curriculum of philosophical study in most medieval universities, giving birth to a very rich tradition of commentaries, especially c. 1260‚Äì1360.Cf. Sander Wopke de Boer, The Science of the Soul: The Commentary Tradition on Aristotle's De Anima, C. 1260‚Äì1360, Leuven : Leuven University Press, 2013. Although Plato had been Aristotle's teacher, most of Plato's writings were not translated into Latin until over 200 years after the Recovery of Aristotle. In the Middle Ages, the only book of Plato in general circulation was the first part of the dialogue Timaeus (to 53c), as a translation, with commentary, by Calcidius (or Chalcidius). The Timaeus describes Plato's cosmology, as his account of the origin of the universe. In the 12th century Henry Aristippus of Catania made translations of the Meno and the Phaedo, but those books were in limited circulation. Some other translations of Plato's books disappeared during the Middle Ages. Finally, about 200 years after the rediscovery of Aristotle, in the wider Renaissance Marsilio Ficino (1433‚Äì99) translated and commented on Plato's complete works.

Career Kelley obtained his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Stanford University in 1926 under George Sutton Parks (1894‚Äì1966), a noted researcher in the field of chemical thermodynamics. From 1927 to 1928, Kelley served as a National Research Council Fellow in Chemistry at the University of California. From 1928 to 1929, he was appointed an acting assistant professor at Stanford. In 1929, Kelley went to work as an associate physical chemist for the Region III Pacific Experiment Station of the Metallurgical Division of the United States Bureau of Mines in Berkeley, California. He eventually became a chemist (1937), senior chemist (1941), and finally Chief of the Minerals Thermodynamics Branch (1959). He retired from this post in 1964. From 1964 to 1969, Kelley was a lecturer in metallurgy at UC-Berkeley. Research papers Kelley is well known for a large number of technical papers (‚âà85) on the thermochemical properties (e.g. free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, vapor pressure) of many different inorganic substances (including elements, compounds, and alloys) from the 1930s to the 1960s, published primarily in the U.S. Bureau of Mines Bulletin. Some of these articles were independent research (particularly high-temperature calorimetry) and some were compilations of data from many sources (review articles), in which he assessed, tabulated, summarized, and/or correlated the results from different studies. With Ralph Hultgren, P. D. Anderson, and R. L. Orr, Kelley published the Selected Values of Thermodynamic Properties of Metals and Alloys (Wiley & Sons, New York, ) in 1963. This was a 963-page treatise that was subsequently revised by the American Society for Metals in 1973 with two companion books: Selected Values of Thermodynamic Properties of Binary Alloys and Selected Values of Thermodynamic Properties of the Elements. These two books contained new data that was either not available at the time of the original publication or that replaced less reliable data from outdated measurement techniques. Kelley's work is still often cited in theoretical metallurgy. His research was very influential in, and was expanded on later by, that of others, such as UC- Berkeley metallurgy professor Ralph Hultgren (1905‚Äì1993), as well as Lawrence B. Pankratz, Alia D. Mah, and Edward G. King of the U.S. Bureau of Mines.

Both pilots, the only two people on board, were killed. The accident marked the second loss of a 747 freighter due to cargo hold fire in less than a year, following the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6 in Dubai in September 2010. Accident Asiana Cargo Flight 991, crewed by two pilots (52-year old Captain Choi Sang-gi and 43-year-old First officer Lee Jeong-woong) with a combined experience of over 19,000 flight hours, took off from Seoul's Incheon International Airport at 03:04am on 28 July local time bound for Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The aircraft was loaded with 58 tonnes of cargo; most of the freight was standard cargo, semi-conductors, mobile phones, liquid crystal displays, and light-emitting diodes. The remainder consisted of of lithium batteries and other potentially dangerous materials, such as paint and photoresist fluid. While cruising at less than an hour into the flight, at 03:54am, the crew contacted air traffic control reporting a fire on board, requesting an immediate descent and diversion to Jeju Airport, South Korea, for an emergency landing. The aircraft was observed on radar at 04:01am descending towards and then erratically climbing and descending for the following nine minutes, reaching an altitude of almost . In the last communications to air traffic control, the crew reported heavy vibrations and loss of flight controls authority. After a steep descent to , radio contact was lost at 04:11am, when the aircraft was west of Jeju Island. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was a four-engined Boeing 747-48EF with South Korean registration HL7604, manufactured and delivered to Asiana in 2006. The aircraft, a freighter version of the popular Boeing 747 passenger jet, had flown more than 26,300 flight hours, and its maintenance history did not reveal anything significant in relation to the accident flight. Search Search and rescue operations conducted by the Republic of Korea Coast Guard recovered parts of the aircraft within a day of the crash. The search effort involved a total of ten ships from the Coast Guard, the Navy and the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration, as well as three helicopters. The South Korean government also requested the assistance of Singapore and the U.S. Navy. On 17 August, the search team identified the location of 39 parts of the aircraft lying on the sea floor at a depth of approximately 80 meters. Among them was the tail section, which was expected to contain the two flight recorders, but both boxes had broken off their mounting brackets and were never found. The bodies of the two crewmembers were recovered on 29 October. Investigation The South Korean Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) conducted the investigation, but due to the loss of both flight recorders, it could not fully determine the causes of the fire nor the exact sequence of events that lead to the impact with the sea. From the distribution of fire and heat damage on the recovered debris, it was determined that a fire started in or near one of the ULD pallets containing dangerous goods in the rear fuselage, but not enough evidence was found to determine exactly what caused the fire. The fire was not contained and quickly propagated forward to the rest of the fuselage. Fire damage and soot was found in the air conditioning ducts that run along the fuselage and on ceiling panels near the cockpit area. The cockpit smoke evacuation vent displayed traces of soot, indicating that smoke entered the cockpit. Some electronic components that were part of the cargo were found embedded in the wing's upper surface, together with traces of paint and photoresist, suggesting that at some point the flammable liquids transported in one of the pallets ignited, causing an explosion that blew out portions of the fuselage midair. It was estimated that from the moment the fire was first detected to the final impact with the sea, only 18 minutes elapsed. It was deemed unlikely that the crew would have been able to extinguish the fire or safely land the plane within that time frame. Aftermath According to Asiana, the crash of Flight 991 led to damages to the airline of about $190 million U.S. (200.4 billion won). In 2012, the International Civil Aviation Organization considered applying new safety standards to air carriage of lithium batteries as a result of this and the preceding crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6.

It consists of rice cooked in goat meat broth, goat milk, and clarified butter (most often ghee). It is popular among the Arab community in Indonesia and Betawi people in Jakarta. Nasi kebuli was influenced by Arab culture and its origin can be traced to Middle eastern cuisine, especially Yemeni Arabian influence (mandi rice or kabsa), Indian cuisine influence (biryani rice), and Afghan influence (kabuli palaw). In Betawi culture, nasi kebuli usually served during Islamic religious festivities, such as Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha or Mawlid (birthday of Muhammad). Nasi kebuli also popular in cities with significant Arab descendants, such as Jakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya, Gresik and Banyuwangi Origin Nasi kebuli gets its name and trace its origin from the kabuli palaw, which is an Afghan variety of pilaf from Kabul, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent, but with heavy influence of Hadhrami and Indian cuisine such as Mandi and Biryani in the cooking methods and seasoning. The Middle-Eastern version of kabuli rice is more similar to kabuli palaw than Indonesian nasi kebuli. The word pilaf, palau or palaw simply means a rice dish cooked with a seasoned broth. According to history, the dish was brought to the Middle-East from the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. One distinction is the presence of shredded carrots and perhaps grapes in the Middle-east or Afghan version of Kebuli. Preparation Nasi kebuli is made by cooking rice soaked in goat meat broth with milk or coconut milk instead of water. The goat meat is later cooked and mixed with sauteed spice mixture in a clarified butter (often with ghee, locally known as minyak samin). The spice mixture is made from ground garlic, shallot, ginger, black pepper, clove, coriander, caraway, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and ghee. Then the goat meat, spices and sliced tomatoes are boiled together with half cooked rice in milk until completely cooked. Nasi kebuli is usually served with asinan nanas (pineapple in spicy and sour sauce) or sometimes also topped with sambal goreng hati (cow liver in spicy sambal sauce) and sprinkled with raisins and sometimes nuts. In Indonesian Hadhrami community, sometimes it is served along with maraq soup (spice lamb/goat soup).

The other is Svangaskar√∞ in Toftir. The Faroe Islands national football team represents the Faroe Islands in association football and is controlled by the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF), the governing body of the sport in the country. It competes as a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), which encompasses the countries of Europe. Organised football has been played in the country since the 19th century; Tv√∏royrar B√≥ltfelag was its first club, founded in 1892. Initially, clubs played friendlies to determine the winner of an unofficial championship, with matches being contested home and away, depending on the weather and the state of the generally uneven grass pitches. The Faroe Islands Sports Association was formed in 1939, and three years later a national league was created. Cup competitions were introduced in 1955 before the FSF was founded on 13 January 1979. The Faroe Islands joined the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) on 2 July 1988, and played its first official match‚Äîa 1‚Äì0 defeat against Iceland‚Äîon 24 August 1988. The nation recorded its first victory in its next friendly, 1‚Äì0 against Canada. On 18 April 1990, the Faroe Islands became a member of UEFA and entered its first major international competition later that year: the qualifying rounds for the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship. The team won their first competitive match on 12 September 1990 when they defeated Austria 1‚Äì0. The Faroe Islands made its first appearance in the qualifying rounds of the FIFA World Cup during the 1994 edition, but the country has yet to reach the finals of either competition. The team's largest victory came on 25 May 1995 when they defeated San Marino by three goals to nil. Their worst loss is 8‚Äì1 against Yugoslavia in 1996. The Faroe Islands have also been defeated by seven goals to nil three times: against Yugoslavia in 1991; Romania in 1992; and Norway in 1993. Fr√≥√∞i Benjaminsen holds the appearance record for the Faroe Islands, having been capped 87 times during an international career that lasted 16 years. The goalscoring record is held by R√≥gvi Jacobsen, who scored ten times in 54 matches. As of January 2020, the Faroe Islands are ranked 110th in the FIFA World Rankings. Its highest ever ranking of 74th was achieved in July 2015.

It is named for the nearby Choctaw Corner, which marked the border between the native Choctaw and Creek peoples prior to the Indian removal. The community was one of the earliest settlements in the county. Choctaw Corner had a post office by 1850. It was a prosperous community during the antebellum period and for many years afterwards. Then, when the railroad from Mobile to Selma came through Clarke County in 1888, less than southeast of Choctaw Corner, the town began to die. A new town, Thomasville, developed on the railroad. The people in the older community saw the potential of the new town as a railroad shipping point and were among the first people to move there.

Life Sidney Elisabeth Croskery was born in Gortgranagh, Killinure, County Tyrone.Sidney Elisabeth Croskery: Whilst I Remember, The Blackstaff Press, Dundonald, 1983, Her parents were Derry-born James Croskery, an ordained Minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and Mildred Jane Croskery (n√©e Wallace), a medical doctor who had qualified in Edinburgh, though she did not practise. When she was three years old her father died suddenly and the family had to leave their country house (Mountjoy Manse) and move to Belfast. She and her elder sister Lilian were educated at Victoria College Kindergarten and Princess Gardens School in Belfast. Following their mother's example, both young women went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Sidney Elisabeth Croskery gained a Ph.D. in medicine in 1927. Croskery worked at the Coombe Women & Infants University Hospital in Dublin. From 1927 to 1939 Croskery joined her sister working as a GP in Tunbridge Wells. During this time she became a member of the Society of Friends because she was a pacifist. She said in later life that she had decided to become a medical missionary at the age of seven. In 1939 Eleanor Petrie, a doctor working in Sana'a, in the Yemen, as part of the British Medical Mission to Yemen, asked Croskery to take her place for nine months or so while she was on leave. Croskery accepted the invitation. She worked as a doctor in Bayhan and Aden, particularly on eye diseases and maternity and ante-natal treatment. She was responsible for the health of the Sultan's harem and that of their children; rickets was a particular problem. However, due to the outbreak of war, Croskery was not allowed to return home until April 1945. After the war she returned to Aden to continue her medical work, but, due to a serious attack on a colleague, felt compelled to resign her position. Over the following years, until she left Aden in 1967, she worked in different parts of Arabia, concentrating on surveying, treating and preventing blindness as a representative of the British Empire Society for the Blind (later the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind). This work was unpaid. She also worked as medical officer for Aden Port Trust Family Clinic, and served with the Church of Scotland Medical Mission in Yemen. Even after her \\"official\\" retirement Croskery spent four winters in remote parts of the Yemen, treating people with trachoma. After Croskery finally retired she returned to live in Belfast, where her married sister and family still lived, to be joined later by Lilian. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire for public service in Aden. Croskery donated a collection of antiquities from Yemen to the British Museum, and some coins to the Ulster Museum.

Premise The film profiles Diane Schuler, who caused the fatal car accident, through interviews with her family members and friends, and attempts to piece together Schuler's actions on the day of the accident, in order to determine why the accident took place. The primary interviewees are Schuler's husband, Daniel, and sister-in-law, Jay, who are convinced that the toxicology report showing Schuler's high level of alcohol and THC intoxication was inaccurate, or that Schuler did not knowingly consume the intoxicants.

In 1837 he became a member of the Society of ApothecariesFrederic Boase, ed., Modern English Biography, Supplement v. 1-3 (1906), p. 2083 and on 11 May 1838 a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. His younger brother, Edward Burley Clayton, also became a surgeon. He died in 1851 from severe injuries caused when a horse he was riding in Park Lane collided with a cab.The Gentleman's magazine, vol. 190 (1851), p. 221: \\"June 23 ‚Äî Edward Burley Clayton, esq., surgeon, second son of James Clayton, esq., of Percy-st. Bedford-sq. He was on horseback in Park-lane when a cab ran against him and caused such severe injuries that he died in great agony.\\" Their father died in 1854. Career The Prince of Wales in 1864 After completing his medical education, Clayton first practiced from his father's address, 3, Percy Street, off Bedford Square. In 1842 he was elected, like his father, a Fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London,'Fellows of the Society' in Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, 2nd series vol. 8 (1843), p. x and on 14 March 1843 read a paper to the Society concerning seventeen cases of a hacking cough which he had observed since 1841 as surgeon to the St Pancras School for Female Children, a charity school at St Pancras, London. This was published in that year's volume of Medico-Chirurgical Transactions under the title Some Account of an Hysterical Affection of the Vocal Apparatus, with several cases.Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. 26 (1843), 115-119 On 13 October 1853 Clayton was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was still at the Percy Street address in 1859,London Gazette (Supplement) dated 26 February 1859, p. 823 but most of his later years in practice were spent at Number 5, Harley Street. In his middle years he became a \\"fashionable\\" society doctor and was the personal physician of two of the sons of Queen Victoria. In 1868, he was appointed as Extra Surgeon-in-Ordinary to the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, and Surgeon-in-Ordinary to his brother, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. This caused the Medical Press and Circular to comment acidly: Despite the misgivings of the medical press, in 1872 the Prince of Wales fell sick at Scarborough with typhoid fever, and Clayton correctly diagnosed the illness. Clayton was always credited with the Prince's recovery.Frederick Townsend Martin, Things I Remember (1913), p. 138 Clayton also became Surgeon to the Metropolitan Police, the London Philanthropic Society, and the charity of St George the Martyr, Southwark. His patients included Lord Randolph Churchill, who shortly after the birth of his son Winston made repeated visits to Clayton for \\"an undisclosed ailment\\". Frank Harris later claimed that this was syphilis.Ted Morgan, Churchill: Young Man in a Hurry, 1874-1915 (1984), p. 23: \\"In January 1875, only a month after Winston's birth, Randolph made repeated visits to the family doctor, Oscar Clayton, for an undisclosed ailment. According to Frank Harris, the editor of Fortnightly Magazine, who published the revelation in his scandalous autobiography, My Life and Loves, Randolph caught syphilis...\\" In 1885, under the heading A STAR IN THE MEDICAL FIRMAMENT, the Midland Medical Miscellany reported: On one occasion, after Clayton had successfully treated Princess Louise, Sir James Reid, Queen Victoria's personal physician, was angry when he heard that Clayton had given the Queen a prescription for her rheumatism. Reid wrote to William Jenner \\"If he begins that sort of thing, there is no saying where it may end\\". Clayton hastily responded to Reid to say he had not prescribed for the Queen.Michaela Reid, Ask Sir James: Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria (1989), p. 172 Towards the end of his life, while both were staying with Sydney Stern, Clayton remarked to the American writer Frederick Townsend Martin Private life Clayton had a house in Hertfordshire at Grove Cottage, Bushey Heath. Always one who \\"loved a lord\\", he was once heard to remark \\"I've been in luck to-day, I've met no less than seven duchesses!\\" He attended the Prince of Wales's lev√©e at St James's Palace in May 1867,The Medical Times and Gazette dated 1 June 1867, vol. 1, p. 599 and at another lev√©e in March, 1869, he was presented to Queen Victoria by the Lord Chamberlain, Viscount Sidney.The Lancet dated 13 March 1869: vol. 1, p. 386 In 1874, Vanity Fair magazine made Clayton No. 87 in its 'Men of the Day' series, publishing a caricature of him by \\"Ape\\" (Carlo Pellegrini) entitled \\"Fashionable Surgery\\".\\"Fashionable Surgery\\", in Vanity Fair magazine dated 12 September 1874. Pellegrini's original watercolour is in the National Portrait Gallery, which describes Clayton in its catalogue as \\"Surgeon and socialite\\".Sir Oscar Clayton (1816-1892), Surgeon and socialite in online catalogue of National Portrait Gallery, London, at npg.org.uk, accessed 1 August 2011 In 1880, in a series of sketches called \\"Our Doctors\\", Edmund Yates's magazine Time: a Monthly Miscellany published a sketch of a society doctor entitled \\"Mr Osric Claypole\\". This piece begins \\"Gold-rimmed spectacles; hair carefully distributed by the brush... a rosy, healthy face... When Osric Claypole dines out, which he does on every night that he does not entertain at home, he shuffles off the last remnant of the doctoral coil, and is the heartiest and merriest of companions.\\" The sketch also referred to Claypole's \\"patients of the upper thousand of the upper ten\\".Time, vol. 2, pp. 540-542 A few weeks later, The Academy, reviewing the sketch in Time, commented that \\"Mr. Osric Claypole, with his Louis Seize furniture, his S√®vres, and his \\"younger Court\\", might have figured at once in the World as a social \\"Celebrity at Home\\". Why not \\"Mr. Oscar Clayton in Harley Street\\"?\\"The Academy, vol. 17 (1880), p. 120 In 1890 a portrait of Clayton was painted by Frederick Goodall and exhibited at the Royal Academy.Frederick Goodall R.A. 1822‚Äì1904 at goodallartists.ca, accessed 29 July 2011 Now in the Hunterian Gallery in Glasgow,Sir Oscar Clayton at bbc.co.uk/arts, accessed 30 August 2014 this was described in the art journal The Academy: In his diary for 30 November 1882, the day Clayton was knighted, Lewis Harcourt wrote \\"Several people went down on the same train to be knighted, among them Oscar Clayton, who is nominally doctor, but really \\"pimp\\" to the Prince of Wales\\".Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt, Loulou: selected extracts from the journals of Lewis Harcourt (1880-1895) pp. 50-51: \\"30 November 1882 I drove to Paddington at 12 this morning with the Chief, who went down to a Council at Windsor.

Honours After being appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and of that of St Michael and St George, and also a Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex, Clayton was knighted on 30 November 1882. The same year, the University of Erlangen awarded him the degree of Doctor of Medicine. He was also a Knight of the Order of Leopold of Belgium.

The film stars Geraldine Chaplin and Fernando Cebri√°n as a troubled married couple. Their marital problems are partially a consequence of Spain's rapidly modernizing consumer society. Saura explains that his film is \\"the study of the crisis in a seemingly developed society, the crisis of the modern Spaniard who, underneath the new veneer, is still a medieval man, who still has working within him the old taboos and moral repressions from his religious past.\\"Bratton, Jean.

Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes is seated third from left. The Coluna Prestes (or Coluna Miguel Costa-Prestes), also known as the Prestes Column, was a social rebel movement between 1925 and 1927 in Brazil, with links to Tenente revolts. The ideology of the movement was diffuse, but the main issues were dissatisfaction with the Rep√∫blica Velha, the institution of the secret ballot, and the defense of public education. A 25,000 km (15,534 mi) march through the Brazilian countryside, the march did not aim to defeat the enemy forces of the Federal government, but rather to ensure the insurrectionists' survival and their ability to continue threatening the federal government.  Uprising  On 5 July 1924, on the second anniversary of the \\"18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt\\" exploded in S√£o Paulo an armed uprising. The \\"Tenentes\\" under orders of general Isidoro Dias Lopes occupied large parts of the city, however, were soon besieged by increasingly numerous federal troops. After 3 weeks under heavy bombardment the rebels abandoned their positions, filling a train with man and supply they retreated into the countryside eventually reaching an occupying the city of Foz do Igua√ßu on the state of Paran√°, frontier with Argentina. There the rebels established a powerful defense line, and waited for their enemies, soon to arrive under command of General C√¢ndido Mariano Rondon. In support of the revolutionary's similar uprising's started in the states of Amazonas and Sergipe but were fastly extinguished. On the state of Rio Grande do Sul, however, events took another turn. As it happened, 3 months after the retreat of the Tenentes from the city of S√£o Paulo, numerous army units took rebellion on the cities of Alegrete, Cachoeira, Uruguaiana, S√£o Lu√≠s, Santo Ang√™lo and S√£o Borja.Neto, Lira.

Only in the region of S√£o Luiz Gonzaga they were able to resist under the leadership of captain Luis Carlos Prestes of the 1¬∫ Frontier Battalion of Santo √Çngelo. Under his order, the remaining rebel forces gathered. In December 1924 fourteen thousand man loyal to the government marched towards S√£o Luiz Gonzaga and started to fortify positions around the rebels. By then, Prestes had made contact with an envoy of the general Isidoro. It was Jo√£o Franscico, a veteran from the federalist rebellions known as \\"Hiena do Cati\\", who: informed him of his promotion to coronel by the revolutionary command, gave him full control of the rebel forces on Rio Grande do Sul and ordered him to ride his man north to gather with the paulistas on the embankments of the Paran√° river.Neto, Lira.

Tensions arise when the couple, unaware at first that Diane is in reality a centuries-old vampire, realize that they are both objects of the pale temptress' seductions.

She and her husband Charles Swartz had written a script, The Student Teachers but producer Larry Woolner wanted to make a vampire film after the success of Daughters of Darkness (1970). Rothman and Swartz came up with a present-day vampire story originally entitled Through the Looking Glass. Rothman said she was interested in making a vampire female where a female was the protagonist rather than the victim.'Exploiting Feminism: An Interview with Stephanie Rothman (Part One)' Confessions of an Aca Fan: The Official Weblog of Henry Jenkins, Oct 16,2007 The character name \\"Diane Le Fanu\\" was a reference to author Sheridan Le Fanu, writer of Carmilla. The script was written over three months. Rothman deliberately put a lot of comedy into it in order to make it different. Blues artist Johnny Shines appeared in the movie and performed his self-penned song \\"Evil-Hearted Woman.\\"Ben Windham, 'Bluesman Shines still hits the chord', The Tuscaloosa News, July 7, 1985 The movie was shot in February 1971. Yarnall had only just given birth to her daughter and remembers \\"everyone was very accommodating, just a joy to work with. Stephanie... was wonderful, open. It was my first experience having a female director and it was remarkable especially concerning the sexual scenes. Stephanie was very sensitive. She closed the set during the more explicit shots, and there was often just Michael and I and the cameraman.\\" Reception Roger Corman later claimed he was disappointed with the final product and released it on a double bill with an Italian horror movie, Scream of the Demon Lover. Box office Stephanie Rothman admitted the film's commercial reception was disappointing. She thought the problem may have been the movie: > Fell between two stools. It's not a traditional horror film nor a hard-core > exploitation movie. In some places it was booked into art theatres. In > others it had one week saturation release in drive ins and hard top > theatres. There was no consistent distribution pattern for it because people > responded differently to it and I think that may be part of the problem. > Also it was an independent producer.

He served as a member of Stanford's board of trustees and as a California superior court judge. His monetary gifts to his alma mater made possible the construction of two student residences on the Stanford campus‚Äîone named for himself, the other dedicated to the memory of his mother.  Early life  George Crothers was born on May 27, 1870 in Wapello, Iowa to John Crothers and Margaret Jane Crothers (n√©e Fair), who had emigrated to the United States from Ireland the previous year.Clausen, p. 9. The family moved to San Jose, California in 1883, and George enrolled at Stanford in 1891 as part of the new university's \\"pioneer class\\".

Together with his brother, Crothers identified and corrected numerous major legal defects in the terms of the university's founding grantClausen, pp. 41‚Äì56. and successfully lobbied for an amendment to the California state constitution granting Stanford an exemption from taxation on its educational property‚Äîa change which allowed Jane Stanford to donate her stock holdings to the university. In 1902, Crothers became the first alumnus of Stanford to serve as a member of the university's board of trustees. Crothers became involved in legal action over the estate of his maternal uncle, James Graham Fair. Nettie Craven claimed to have been married to Fair at the time of his death, but at a 1900 trial, Crothers' detailed analysis of the handwriting on the documents Craven had offered in support of her claim convinced the court that they were forgeries. From 1913 to 1921, Crothers served as a judge of the Superior Court in San Francisco, California. One case which came before him involved a physician whose license had been revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners for performing an abortion. Judge Crothers refused to overturn the board's revocation on technical grounds, and his decision was upheld on appeal. Even after Crothers' retirement from the bench and his return to private law practice, he was commonly referred to as \\"Judge\\" throughout the rest of his life. In a 1956 letter, former U.S. president (and Stanford classmate) Herbert Hoover wrote, \\"Judge George E.

He has also employed his considerable guitar talents in acclaimed \\"studio work\\" and has guested on various artists' albums/CDs including vocals and guitars for his friend Zeno Roth. Herr Engelke was born on September 24, 1961, in Hanover, Germany. He currently resides in Altenhorst, Niedersachsen, Germany. Helge started playing guitar at the age of 13 and soon became obsessed with the instrument and music in general. To quote Engelke, \\"I listened to everything that was around. From Yes to Genesis, from T Rex to Mott the Hoople, from Deep Purple to Led Zeppelin. My favorite band was - and in some concerns still is - Rainbow. I really liked the mixture of heavy rock guitars with strong vocal melodies and powerful drums.\\" The young musician was a fan of both Uli Jon Roth (then Ulrich Roth) and Michael Schenker so his early guitar preferences were the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Flying V. In 1996, Engelke was in a car accident breaking both arms. It took him approximately five months to recover and regain his playing skills, delaying the recording and mixing of Fair Warning's \\"Live and More\\". On August 11, 2012, Helge married long time girlfriend Olatz Ibarlucea in Llodio, Pais Vasco, Spain. Brief history: Fair Warning, Dreamtide Fair Warning originated in 1990, rising from the ashes of a band called Zeno. They were masterful with their first demo and were immediately signed to WEA worldwide. In the year 2000, Andy Malecek left the group (April) followed by Tommy Heart (August) effectively breaking up the band. Fair Warning reunited in the summer of 2005 and is still active. The band recently recorded a new album, \\"Sundancer\\", which was released on April 24, 2013, in Japan. The CD was released in The United States in June, 2013. Engelke formed Dreamtide in 2001 with then former FW drummer, C.C. Behrens. The band was rounded out with Olaf Senkbeil (vocals), Ole Hempelmann (bass), and Torsten Luederwaldt (keyboards). Francis Buchholz (Scorpions) replaced Hempelmann for the 3rd album. Dreamtide is still active. Other activity In 2011, Engelke was instrumental in the production of German band NITRO GODS eponymous first studio album.

A self-described \\"airport bum\\", he took his first ride in an airplane at age 13, shortly after Charles Lindbergh's landmark flight across the Atlantic Ocean.Obituaries Ann Arbor News May 22, 1998 Growing up in Columbus, Ohio, he was forced to delay college entrance due to the Great Depression.Pellegreno, Ann Holtgren, \\"Professor Lesher, Record- Setter\\", Air Trails Homebuilt Aircraft, Summer 1970 He eventually entered Ohio State University, where he earned a degree in mathematics. He remained at OSU, doing graduate studies of mathematics and physics. Transferring to the University of Michigan, he earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1940. Career After finishing graduate school, Lesher went to work at Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica, California. There, he worked as a stress analyst on the Douglas C-54 and Douglas A-20 programs. Preferring a university career, in 1941 he accepted a job at Texas A&M; College. There, he taught ground school for the Civilian Pilot Training Program and earned his pilot's license. The next year, he returned to the University of Michigan as a faculty member in the aeronautical engineering department. In 1945, he took a leave of absence and worked at Stinson Aircraft Company in Wayne, Michigan. At Stinson, he worked on the Stinson L-5 Sentinel, Stinson L-13 and the Stinson 106 Skycoach. The Skycoach was a four-place aircraft with a pusher propeller, a configuration which captured Lesher's imagination. He returned to teaching at the University of Michigan after this. In 1952 he took another leave of absence and spent 15 months working at Convair in San Diego California. Again, he returned to the University of Michigan, where he assisted in wind tunnel projects and did structural consulting in addition to his teaching responsibilities. Beginning in 1962, he began working at the Willow Run Laboratories of the University of Michigan. In August 1958, he attended one of the early Experimental Aircraft Association Fly-Ins. The homebuilt aircraft he saw there inspired him to design one himself. Remembering the Skycoach, he began the design of an all-aluminum two-place, side-by-side, pusher propeller aircraft. Construction began in February 1959. In October 1961, after 5,000 hours of construction, he first flew his aircraft, the Lesher Nomad (N1066Z) at Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti, Michigan. A novel design feature was his use of a Dodge Flexidyne Coupling in the drive train to dampen torsional vibrations. The aircraft was powered by a 100 hp Continental O-200 engine driving a 72-inch Hartzell ground-adjustable propeller.Lesher, Edgar J., \\"Nomad\\", EAA Sport Aviation, June 1963. He flew the Nomad to the 1962 EAA Fly- In in Rockford, Illinois, where the design attracted a lot of interest. In 1964, flying Nomad, he took the grand prize in the AC Spark Plug Rally. After returning home, he began looking into the existing FAI records and realized that he could design an aircraft to break the altitude, speed and distance records of Class C1a (propeller) for aircraft below 1,102 lbs gross weight. He began work on the design, and in October 1962 he started construction on what was to become the Lesher Teal (N4291C). The aircraft was configured as an all- aluminum single-place aircraft, powered by a 100 hp Continental O-200 engine driving a 64-inch Hartzell ground-adjustable propeller.Lesher, Edgar J., \\"Teal\\", EAA Sport Aviation, March 1968. By April 28, 1965, the airframe was complete. On that day, Lesher made the aircraft's first flight at Willow Run Airport. That August, he flew Teal to the 1965 EAA Fly-In in Rockford, Illinois, where he won an award from the EAA for his achievements. After two years of testing Teal, on May 22, 1967, he flew the aircraft to a new 500 km closed-course Class C1a speed record of 181.55 mph. On June 30, he set a new 1,000 km closed-course speed record of 169.20 mph and on October 20, he set a new 2,000 km closed-course speed record of 141.84 mph. On May 6, 1968, while flying Teal near Ann Arbor, he experienced a loss of power. Not being able to make it to a nearby airport, he made an emergency landing in a field. The airplane was badly damaged, but he was unhurt. After rebuilding Teal, on September 9, 1970, he set a new Class C1a closed-circuit distance record of 1554.29 miles.Lesher, Edgar J., \\"Teal Progress Report\\", EAA Sport Aviation, February 1970. Later, on September 29, 1973, he set a new Class C1a 3 km speed record of 173.101 mph and the next day he set a new 15‚Äì25 km speed record of 169.134 mph.Lesher, Edgar J., \\"Connecticut Sojourn\\", EAA Sport Aviation, June 1974. Finally, on July 2, 1975, he set a new Class C1a record for distance in a straight line by flying 1,835.459, flying from Florida to Arizona.Lesher, Edgar J., \\"Teal Trek\\", EAA Sport Aviation, February 1976. He continued to fly Teal for many more years, but never made any more record attempts. For his record-breaking flights, he won the FAI's Louis Bleriot Medal four times and was inducted in the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988.Enshrinees Retrieved 27 July 2011. In 1978, he began construction of a larger aircraft, \\"Nene\\", which he hoped to break the FAI Class C1b records. However, the aircraft was not completed. He retired from the University of Michigan in 1985. The Teal was donated to the EAA Airventure Museum in 2002.Lesher Teal ‚Äì N4291C Retrieved 27 July 2011. Other activities Lesher was involved with the Ann Arbor Civic Theater as a set designer and actor and sang in the Ann Arbor Civic Chorus.

Named for Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher, the Prussian victor of the Battle of Waterloo, the ship was laid down in August 1936 and launched in June 1937. She was completed in September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. After completing a series of sea trials and training exercises, the ship was pronounced ready for service with the fleet on 5 April 1940. She was armed with a main battery of eight guns and, although nominally under the limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, actually displaced over . Immediately upon entering service, Bl√ºcher was assigned to the task force that supported the invasion of Norway in April 1940. Bl√ºcher served as the flagship of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Oskar Kummetz, the commander of Group 5. The ship led the flotilla of warships into the Oslofjord on the night of 8 April, to seize Oslo, the capital of Norway. Two old coastal guns in the Oscarsborg Fortress engaged the ship at very close range, scoring two hits, as did several smaller guns in other batteries. Two torpedoes fired by a torpedo battery in the fortress struck the ship, causing serious damage. A major fire broke out aboard Bl√ºcher, which could not be contained. The fire spread to one of her anti-aircraft gun magazines, causing a large explosion, and then spread further to the ship's fuel bunkers. Bl√ºcher then capsized and sank with major loss of life. The wreck lies at the bottom of Oslofjord, and in 2016 was designated as a war memorial to protect it from looters. Several artifacts have been raised from the wreck, including one of her Arado 196 floatplanes, which was recovered during an operation to pump out leaking fuel oil from the ship in 1994.  Design  Recognition drawing of an Admiral Hipper-class cruiser The of heavy cruisers was ordered in the context of German naval rearmament after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and repudiated the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, Germany signed the Anglo‚ÄìGerman Naval Agreement with Great Britain, which provided a legal basis for German naval rearmament; the treaty specified that Germany would be able to build five \\"treaty cruisers\\". The Admiral Hippers were nominally within the 10,000-ton limit, though they significantly exceeded the figure. As launched, Bl√ºcher was long overall, had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of . Bl√ºcher was powered by three sets of Blohm & Voss geared steam turbines that drove three propellers. The turbines were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship's top speed was at . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men. Bl√ºchers primary armament was eight SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve L/65 guns, twelve guns, and eight guns. She had four triple torpedo launchers, all on the main deck next to the four range finders for the anti-aircraft guns. Bl√ºchers armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides. The ship was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. Blucher never had more than two seaplanes on board, and en route to Oslo one had to rest on the catapult as one of the hangars was used for storing bombs and torpedoes.  Service history  Bl√ºcher launching at Kiel, 8 June 1937 Bl√ºcher was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Her keel was laid on 15 August 1936, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 8 June 1937, and was completed slightly over two years later, on 20 September 1939, the day she was commissioned into the German fleet. The commanding admiral of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Naval Station), Admiral Conrad Albrecht, gave the christening speech. Mrs. Erdmann, widow of Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Alexander Erdmann, former commander of who had died in the ship's sinking, performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow increasing the overall length to . A raked funnel cap was also installed. Bl√ºcher spent most of November 1939 fitting out and finishing additional improvements. By the end of the month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises in the Baltic, but by the middle of the month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be ready for action, and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.  Operation Weser√ºbung  Emden On 5 April 1940, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Oskar Kummetz came aboard the ship while she was in Swinem√ºnde. An 800-strong detachment of ground troops from the 163rd Infantry Division also boarded. Three days later, on 8 April, Bl√ºcher left port, bound for Norway; she was the flagship for the force that was to seize Oslo, the Norwegian capital, Group 5 of the invasion force, She was accompanied by the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow, the light cruiser , and several smaller escorts. The British submarine spotted the convoy steaming through the Kattegat and Skagerrak, and fired a spread of torpedoes; the Germans evaded the torpedoes, however, and proceeded with the mission. Night had fallen by the time the German flotilla reached the approaches to the Oslofjord. Shortly after 23:00 (Norwegian time), the Norwegian patrol boat spotted the flotilla. The German torpedo boat attacked Pol III and set her on fire, but not before the Norwegian patrol boat raised the alarm with a radio report of being attacked by unknown warships. At 23:30 (Norwegian time) the south battery on Rau√∏y spotted the flotilla in the searchlight and fired two warning shots. Five minutes later, the guns at the Rau√∏y battery fired four rounds at the approaching Germans, but visibility was poor and no hits were scored. The guns at Bol√¶rne fired only one warning shot at 23:32. Before Bl√ºcher could be targeted again, she was out of the firing sector of these shore guns and was seen no more by them after 23:35. The German flotilla steamed on at a speed of . Shortly after midnight (Norwegian time), an order from the Commanding Admiral to extinguish all lighthouses and navigation lights was broadcast over the NRK (Norsk rikskringkasting) [Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]. The German ships had been ordered to fire only in the event they were directly fired on first. Between 00:30 and 02:00, the flotilla stopped and 150 infantrymen of the landing force were transferred to the escorts R17 and R21 (from Emden) and R18 and R19 (from Bl√ºcher). Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound One of the three guns at Oscarsborg Fortress The R-boats were ordered to engage Rau√∏y, Bol√¶rne and the naval port and city of Horten. Despite the apparent loss of surprise, the Bl√ºcher proceeded further into the fjord to continue with the timetable to reach Oslo by dawn. At 04:20, Norwegian searchlights again illuminated the ship and at 04:21 the guns of Oscarsborg Fortress opened fire on Bl√ºcher at very close range, beginning the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound with two hits on her port side. The first was high above the bridge, hitting the battle station for the commander of the anti-aircraft guns. The main range finder in the top of the battle mast was knocked out of alignment, but Bl√ºcher had four more major rangefinders. The second 28 cm shell struck near the aircraft hangar and started a major fire. As the fire spread, it detonated explosives carried for the infantry, hindering firefighting efforts. The explosion set fire to the two Arado seaplanes on board: one on the catapult and the other in one of the hangars. The explosion also probably punched a hole in the armored deck over turbine room 1. Turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only the outboard shafts from turbine room 2/3 were operational. The Germans were unable to locate the source of the gunfire. Bl√ºcher increased speed to in an attempt to get past the Norwegian guns. The guns on Dr√∏bak, some on Bl√ºchers starboard side, opened fire as well. At a distance of Bl√ºcher entered the narrows between Kop√•s and Hovedbatteriet, the main battery, at Kaholmen. The Kop√•s battery ceased firing at Bl√ºcher and engaged the next target, L√ºtzow, scoring multiple hits. First engineer Karl Thannemann wrote in his report that the hits from the guns on Dr√∏bak, which were fired on the starboard side, were all between section IV and X in a length of amidships, between B-turret and C-turret. However, all damage was on the port side. After the first salvo from the 15 cm batteries in Dr√∏bak, the steering from the bridge was disabled. Bl√ºcher had just passed Dr√∏bakgrunnen (Dr√∏bak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. At 04:34 two torpedoes from a concealed and unknown battery at the Oscarsborg fortress scored hits on the ship. Bl√ºcher on fire and sinking in Dr√∏bak Sound According to Kummetz's report, the first torpedo hit Boiler Room 2, just under the funnel, and the second hit Turbine Room 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been destroyed by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the steam pipes through Boilers 1 and 2 and Turbine Room 2/3 had been damaged and Turbine 1 had lost power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; most of the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15 cm guns in the Kop√•s battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing, and they were still within range. The battery crews asked for orders, but the commander of the fortress, Birger Eriksen, concluded: \\"The fortress has served its purpose\\". After passing the gun batteries, the crew, including the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she had taken on a list of 18 degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5 cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given. Bl√ºcher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gr√∂ner states that the number of casualties is unknown, and Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. J√ºrgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking. The loss of Bl√ºcher and the damage done to L√ºtzow caused the German force to withdraw. The ground troops were landed on the eastern side of the fjord; they proceeded inland and captured the Oscarborg Fortress by 09:00 on 10 April. They then moved on to attack the capital. Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Bl√ºchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city. Wreck One of Bl√ºchers anchors is now at Aker Brygge in Oslo Bl√ºcher remains at the bottom of the Dr√∏bak Narrows, at a depth of . The ship's screws were removed in 1953, and there have been several proposals to raise the wreck since 1963, but none have been carried out. When Bl√ºcher left Germany, she had about of oil on board. She expended some of the fuel en route to Norway, and some was lost in the sinking, but she was constantly leaking oil. In 1991 the leakage rate increased to per day, threatening the environment. The Norwegian government therefore decided to remove as much oil as possible from the wreck. In October 1994 the company Rockwater AS, together with deep sea divers, drilled holes in 133 fuel tanks and removed of oil; 47 fuel bunkers were unreachable and may still contain oil. After being run through a cleaning process, the oil was sold. The oil extraction operation provided an opportunity to recover one of Bl√ºchers two Arado 196 aircraft. The plane was raised on 9 November 1994 and is currently at the Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola aviation museum near Stavanger. The shipwreck was protected as a war memorial on 16 June 2016, but also protected by law by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage for those who actually have their burial at the bottom of the fjord. The intention was to protect the ship from looters.\\"Blucher\\" protected by law to prevent looting NRK 6/16/2016 Footnotes Notes Citations References      * Category:Admiral Hipper-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Kiel Category:1937 ships Category:World War II cruisers of Germany Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 Category:Ships sunk by coastal artillery ","title":"German cruiser Bl√ºcher"},{"id":"32556759","text":"Scott Christian Forster (born October 27, 1971) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

This is the last film theatrically released by Summit Entertainment before Lionsgate took over distribution. The film earned negative reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment. Plot Jillian \\"Jill\\" Conway (Amanda Seyfried) lives in Portland, Oregon with her sister, Molly (Emily Wickersham). 1 year earlier, Jill was kidnapped by a brutal serial killer who held her captive in a deep vertical hole containing the remains of his other victims somewhere in Portland's 5,100-acre Forest Park. Jill used one of the bones to stab her abductor when he arrived in the hole to kill her, and escaped using his rope ladder. When the Portland police were unable to find the hole and discovered that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution after her parents' death, they believed the abduction only happened in Jill's head and sent her back to a psychiatric facility. Jill now works as a waitress in a local diner on the graveyard shift. She and her friend, Sharon Ames (Jennifer Carpenter), are generously tipped by a regular customer. Returning home one day after work, Jill discovers Molly is missing and not even her sister's boyfriend, Billy (Sebastian Stan), knows her whereabouts. Knowing her sister wouldn't run off since she had an exam the next day, Jill is then convinced the serial killer who took her has now taken Molly. However, Police Lt. Ray Bozeman (Michael Par√©), Sergeant Powers (Daniel Sunjata), and Detective Erica Lonsdale (Katherine Moennig) dismiss her claims, believing that it's all in Jill's head. Only the department's newest Homicide detective, Peter Hood (Wes Bentley), believes Jill, giving her his card in case she needs any help about the case. Jill interrogates her neighbors and learns that a van with a locksmith company's name was parked in front of her house in the middle of the night. She talks to the company's owner, Henry Massey (Ted Rooney), and his son, Nick (Joel David Moore). When Nick denies any knowledge, Jill breaks into the van, where she finds a receipt from a hardware store for items the killer would use. She holds Nick at gunpoint and forces him to reveal that he allowed a stranger named \\"Digger\\" to rent the van during the night. Jill goes to the hardware store and learns \\"Digger\\"'s real name, Jim LaPointe (Socratis Otto), and address. She breaks into LaPointe's room and finds duct tape, pet food like that which she was given by her kidnapper, and matches from the diner where she works. Meanwhile, Nick reports Jill's gun-waving to the police, who begin to search for her, as Jill's time in a psychiatric institution means she cannot legally possess a firearm. Jill visits Sharon and learns that LaPointe is the generous tipper from the diner. Sharon gives her his phone number. Jill leaves and calls LaPointe, who gives her directions to a location in Forest Park. There, she locates a small campsite and finds pictures of LaPointe's prior victims. At the same time, Molly breaks out of her restraints and escapes, only to discover she has been concealed under her house all along. Powers and Lonsdale are shocked when they hear Molly's story, finally believing Jill. They also learn Jill is to meet the kidnapper, but they don't know where that is to happen. Jill finds the hole where LaPointe held her captive. LaPointe ambushes Jill and pulls her into the hole, intending to kill her with the same piece of bone that she stabbed him with in her initial escape. However, Jill shoots him and starts climbing up the rope ladder. When LaPointe grabs her and attempts to pull her back down, Jill desperately kicks LaPointe to break his hold and shoots him again. She then manages to climb out and extract the rope ladder, trapping LaPointe in the hole. After shooting LaPointe a third time in the leg so that he cannot stand, Jill demands he tell her where Molly is, on a promise of not shooting him again. LaPointe admits that Molly was under their house the whole time, and he only used her to lure Jill into the trap. Jill pours a can of kerosene into the hole. As LaPointe begs for his life, Jill simply responds, \\"I lied.\\" She then drops a lantern in the hole, burning LaPointe to death. Jill disposes of the revolver and returns home, finding Molly terrified but unharmed with Powers, Lonsdale, and Hood. As the sisters reunite, Jill whispers to Molly that LaPointe is dead. When Powers asks about the man Jill was to meet, she sarcastically tells the police, \\"It was all in my head.\\" Sometime later, Bozeman receives an anonymous package containing pictures LaPointe had taken of each of his victims bound and gagged, including Jill herself, and a map that indicates the spot in Forest Park where the police can find the hole. Realizing how wrong he was about Jill, Bozeman calls Powers into his office to investigate the new leads. Cast * Amanda Seyfried as Jill Conway * Wes Bentley as Det.

The Battle of the Gulf of Oman was a naval battle between a large Portuguese armada under Dom Fernando de Meneses and the Ottoman Indian fleet under Seydi Ali Reis. The campaign was a catastrophic failure for the Ottomans who lost all of their ships. Background Since the Siege of Diu in 1538, the Ottoman Empire was attempting to counter Portuguese influence in the Indian Ocean. In 1552, Ottoman admiral Piri Reis led a number of expeditions around the Arabian peninsula against the Portuguese with limited success. He was replaced with Murat Reis, who also led an unsuccessful campaign against the Portuguese the following year. In late 1553, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent nominated Seydi Ali as admiral (reis) of Ottoman naval forces stationed in Basra, in replacement of Murat Reis. He was ordered to link up his galleys with those in Suez to better fight the Portuguese, but such a task meant sailing through Portuguese controlled waters in the Persian Gulf. In February 1554, the Portuguese dispatched from Goa six galleons, six caravels, 25 foists, and 1200 Portuguese soldiers under the command of Dom Fernando de Meneses, son of the Viceroy, tasked to blockade the mouth of the Red Sea and collect information on any Ottoman movements. Throughout the month of March the Portuguese sighted not a single merchant ship crossing the Bab-el-Mandeb, presumably because the presence of the Portuguese fleet had discouraged any voyages that season. In April the expedition sailed to Muscat, where part of the fleet was left to spend the winter (\\"winter\\" meaning the monsoon season) while Dom Fernando took the oarships, a galleon, and several merchantships to Hormuz, to replace Dom Ant√£o de Noronha with Bernardim de Sousa as the captain of that fortress. When the westerly winds started blowing in July, the galleon was sent back and Dom Fernando sent 3 small craft (catures) of native fishermen to scout the Shatt al-Arab for any Turkish galleys. The fishermen informed the Portuguese that Moradobec (Murat Reis) had been replaced by Alecheluby (Seydi Ali), and was about to set sail to Suez with 15 galleys. The battle In the beginning of August the Turks set sail from Basra. The Portuguese forces in Muscat were immediately alerted of the Turks' movement and set sail to the Cape Musandam to meet them. The Portuguese oar ships sailed in the front, followed by the caravels and then the heavy galleons. The Ottomans were sighted crossing the cape on August 10, sailing against the wind in a column formation. The Turkish ruse Steadfast, Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali ordered his fleet to maintain formation, sailing against the wind towards the Portuguese. As they closed in, the bombards of the forward Portuguese foists and the galleon Santa Cruz began exchanging shots with the leading Turkish galleys. At the last moment, Seydi Ali Reis ordered all of his galleys to turn to starboard towards land at the same time, thus avoiding the Portuguese ships, which were then unable to give chase because of the wind. The Ottomans successfully dodged a disfavourable encounter with the Portuguese and were now on their way towards Muscat. The Portuguese maneuvre Taken by surprise, the Portuguese captains gathered aboard the flagship S√£o Mateus to discuss how to catch up with the Turkish galleys. A suggestion was taken from an experienced Portuguese pilot, who claimed that winds blew eastwards by the Persian coast, and would allow them to speedily bounce back to the Omani coast ahead of the Turks. The Portuguese fleet sailed north, then east, and after a few days arrived back in Muscat where they got the news that the Turks had not yet sailed by. In the meantime, believing to have definitely left the Portuguese behind, the Turks advanced slowly against the wind, in order to give rest to the rowers, but always followed by Portuguese light oar craft from afar. Portuguese square-rigged caravel, heavier and more suitable for naval combat. The Portuguese waited for two or three days in Muscat, before setting out to meet the Turkish fleet by the nearby Cape Suadi. On the morning of August 25, the Turks once more sighted the same armada that Seydi Ali Reis thought to have eluded several days prior. The clash The Portuguese had now a more favourable westward wind, but because the Turks sailed so close to shore with their sails down, the Portuguese only sighted them at relatively short distance. As a result, they were unable to maneuvre in time to prevent a few Ottoman galleys from sailing past them. The Portuguese flagship S√£o Mateus was then the ship closest to shore and it seemed to be the best positioned to intercept the Turkish galleys. Unable to reach the galleys, however, it dropped anchor and immediately sounded its guns at the enemy fleet. Nine galleys slipped by under Portuguese fire, but the tenth was hit by a large cannonball. Several men were killed and it veered abruptly, blocking the path of the following galleys that were then caught up and immobilized. The Portuguese caravels, the most agile ships of the fleet, promptly maneuvred at full sail to engage the galleys in a boarding battle. The caravel of Dom Jer√≥nimo de Castelo Branco was the first to vigorously ram and grapple two galleys, hurling a large number of clay fire bombs before boarding them. Thrown into disarray, many Turkish sailors and soldiers jumped to sea, where they were cut down by the shallow draught Portuguese foists. Several more caravels arrived to attack the rest of the galleys, that surrendered after a half an hour struggle. Seydi Ali Reis in the meantime, decided to head east across the Arabian Sea to Gujarat with his remaining galleys, hoping to evade the Portuguese as quickly as possible. Dom Fernando de Meneses ordered Dom Jer√≥nimo and the caravels to chase after them. Aftermath Besides the galleys themselves, the Portuguese captured 47 bronze cannon, that they took to Muscat where they were met with celebrations. Seydi Ali Reis would eventually reach Gujarat, and was forced into the harbour of Surat by the caravels of Dom Jer√≥nimo, where he was welcomed by the Gujarati governor. When the Portuguese Viceroy knew in Goa of their presence in India, he dispatched two galleons and 30 oarships on October 10 to the city, to pressure the governor to hand over the Turks. The governor did not surrender them but proposed to destroy their ships, to which the Portuguese agreed. Seydi Ali Reis would later endure a journey of over 2 years before finally making it back to Constantinople overland, having written about the lands he passed by during the voyage. According to his writings, Seydi Ali never realized that the fleet that he encountered on August 10 and 25 was the very same.

The temple is incarnated by the hymns of Thevaram and is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is considered 43rd of the Tevara Stalams in Chola Nadu located North of the river Cauvery. Legend As per Hindu legend, a king belonging to present day Kerala had illicit relation with lot of women. He also tortured and cheated many of them. At one stage, the king wanted to restore to a decent life and found a yogi who advised him to visit Thiruvisanallur. The king reached the place, had a dip in river Cauvery and worshipped Sivayoginathar to get rid of his curse. The legend leads to the belief that whoever incurs curse of women, gets curative visiting the temple. As per another legend, Nandi (the sacred bull of Shiva) got rid of Yama (Hindu god of death), who was approaching a worshipper of Shiva. This legend leads to the belief that a visit to the place is a curative to death related fears.  History  Thiruvisanallur can be traced to the time of the Medieval Cholas having 97 inscriptions dating back to Parantaka I, Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II.  The Temple  Image of the clock The Sivayoginathar Temple is believed to be built at the spot where eight Siva yogis attained salvation and merged with the lingam. The shrine is dedicated to Chatur Kala Bhairava, one of the four Bhairavas. The temple has a 5 tier rajagopuram with a large temple complex. The temple was erected during the Parantaka I reign 907-955 A.D. The sanctum is akin to Vaprabandha type with Arthapadma, a feature not mentioned in Vastu Shastra texts. The beautiful large vyalas in the prathimukha are among the most powerfully conceived of their kind. It is of modest proportions and consists of the sanctuary and its attached mandapam(hall). The two cover a total length of 15.3m, with its vimana measuring about 15.3m. The mandapam is a hall of 4 central pillars, and a vestibule provided at its back, leading to the sanctum, which is a square chamber of 3.7m. The lion motif is absent in the pillars though it reappeared in friezes where ever suited. The pillars in the interior are typical of Chola art. The usual deities are enshrined in the central niches outside the wall of the sanctum. The toranas over the south and west niches are of good workmanship, especially that on the west, which is perhaps the finest in South IndiaTemples of South India P.113. V.V.

The film is a sequel to the 2003 film Once Upon a Time in a Battlefield and stars Jung Jin-young, Lee Moon-sik and Ryu Seung-ryong. The film is set in 668 and chronicles the war between the southern Korean state of Shilla against the larger northern Korean state of Goguryeo. The film's box office returns were lower than expected in South Korea, which prompted Lee Joon-ik to announce his retirement shortly after the film's release. The film has been shown at the New York Asian Film Festival and Fantasia Festival.  Plot  In Korea, AD 668. Kim Beob-min (Hwang Jung-min) is the king of the small southern Korean state of Shilla and makes a deal with China's Tang dynasty officials to have a combined strike against the larger northern Korean state of Goguryeo. The conditions of the agreement involve Shilla being given back the Korean state of Baekje. The combined troops march to Pyongyang Castle, where Goguryeo's Yeon Gaesomun (Lee Won-jong) dies and hands over command of the army to his second son Yeon Nam-geon (Ryu Seung-ryong). This action upsets his first son, Yeon Namsaeng (Yoon Je-moon) who is not as war- hungry as Nam-geon. The Goguryeo soldiers defending the castle succeed in fighting off the Allied Army's first assault by catapulting honey and bees onto the Shilla soldiers. Meanwhile, the Shilla grand general Kim Yushin (Jung Jin-young) holds back sending his main force to join the advance Allied Army, preferring to deal directly with Yeon Gaesomun's sons than the Chinese. Yeon Namsaeng is expelled from the castle by his elder brother. The Chinese commander Yi launches a full-scale attack on the castle but is beaten back by the Goguryeo secret weapon. An allied soldier, Thingamajig (Lee Moon-sik) from Baekje, is captured. Thingamajig, who has suffered under Chinese rule, broadcasts a demoralizing message to the Allied Army. Thingamajig is rewarded by being allowed to marry the brave Goguryeo female warrior, Gap-sun (Sunwoo Sun), against her will.

The film was inspired by the political situation in Korea in 1995. Lee Joon-ik stated he wanted that both Once Upon a Time in a Battlefield and Battlefield Heroes show how influenced Korea was by the countries around it (specifically China, Japan and the United States) which caused a lot of internal conflicts within Korea. Release Battlefield Heroes was released in South Korea on January 27, 2011. The box office returns in Korea were not strong which led to Lee Joon-ik announcing his retirement from directing shortly after. Lee announced his retirement through his Twitter account, stating \\"I‚Äôm quitting directing because the audience [for Battlefield Heroes] was just 1.7 million, far fewer than the 2.5 million we had expected.\\" He returned two years later with Hope, casting top actor Sol Kyung-gu in one of the lead roles. The film was shown at film festivals, including the New York Asian Film Festival in July 2011. It had its Canadian premiere on July 31, 2011 at the Fantasia Festival. Reception The Los Angeles Times wrote a generally favorable review of Battlefield Heroes, stating that the film \\"is a handsome, sweeping period picture, a robust, earthy comedy in which the humor, though sometimes labored, results in an amiable if lengthy entertainment\\". Film Business Asia gave the film an eight out of ten rating stating that the director had grown \\"in leaps and bounds as a technically confident film-maker\\" since the film King and the Clown. The review went on to state that an international audience would benefit \\"by an introductory caption explaining the story set-up in simple terms, as well as some slight trimming throughout\\".

Roman shades are different from standard window shade in that they stack up evenly when being opened; however, when they are open they are visibly smooth, not bumpy or ribbed like typical vertical shades or blinds. Roman shades can be opened with a cord mechanism or can use a cordless mechanism. Each mechanism allows the user to adjust the height of the covered area. In typical construction, cords run vertically on the outer side of the blind running through evenly spaced horizontal stiffener rods or eyelets on the back of the shade and then attached at the bottom of the blind. In this case, the opened portion of the blinds remains smooth, while the bottom will be stacked evenly. Roman shades can also be made with top-down-bottom-up mechanisms which allow only the top of the shade to come down; allowing for privacy yet still letting in natural light from the top of the window.

In August 1958, he attended one of the early Experimental Aircraft Association Fly-Ins. The homebuilt aircraft he saw there inspired him to design one himself.

After being a guest on Steve Austin's Podcast, Iron decided to start his own podcast, Iron-On Wrestling. Early life Gregory Smith was born in 1986 in Cleveland, Ohio. Born one month prematurely and weighing one pound at birth, Smith was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which has left his right arm withered and with extremely limited range of motion. As a child he was subject to bullying, which Smith today attributes to other children not being able to understand his condition. He developed his own unique set of coping skills for dealing with bullying, centered on his being willing and able to tell his own story, and to do it in a self-effacing and sometimes humorous manner. At the same time, his family life left him with little support. While his father, Dwane, worked to support the family, Dwane's wife Gloria became addicted to drugs and would sell off family possessions, and use rent money, to purchase drugs. The couple separated, and Greg, in Gloria's custody, was left to raise his two younger brothers, until Gloria went to jail and Dwane won custody of the boys. Smith's grandmother, a fan of Hulk Hogan, introduced him to professional wrestling. \\"She meant a lot to me, and everything I do in wrestling is in her honor.\\" Professional wrestling career At first, Iron pursued professional wrestling in the weight room, inventing his own regimen since his right hand would not allow him to execute most lifts in the traditional way. In this way he added 30 pounds of muscle to his frame. In early training with J. T. Lightning, Iron took a great deal of punishment, asking for no pity, and modifying wrestling holds so they could be applied using his one good arm. Iron appeared on the very first episode of Pro Wrestling Ohio, televised on Sports Time Ohio, on November 20, 2007, defeating Johnny Gargano in what has often been called an upset. This defeat of Gargano launched Iron's first major feud, as Gargano denied that he could lose to a wrestler with Iron's condition. A brutal attack by Gargano during a PWO taping in February, 2008, left Iron unable to compete for three months. When Iron returned to action, In August, 2008, the feud was settled in a Last Man Standing match, won by Gargano. No stranger to in-ring injury, in a preshow battle royal, Iron was suplexed on his head several times, giving him a severe concussion, putting him in intensive care for three days. His coming back from such injury, combined with his overcoming cerebral palsy to compete, has recently caught the attention of several wrestling promotions, and fans appreciating his ability to wrestle a good match despite his condition. Iron allows opponents to mock his condition and his right hand, as a means to put him over as a face and his opponent as a heel. \\"That's what it is there for. You are the bad guy. A horrible person would make fun of my hand. That only gets the crowd more excited and on my side.\\" Iron is also the longtime tag team partner of Hobo Joe, in the \\"Homeless Handicapped Connection,\\" billed as mutually overcoming many obstacles to compete. They capped a feud with Sex Appeal (Bobby Beverly and Bobby Shields, accompanied by Nickie Valentino) by enlisting the help of another handicapped wrestler, Zach Gowen.Dombrowski, J. \\"PWO Personality Profile: Homeless Handicapped Connection\\", \\"WrestleView\\", February 27, 2011, accessed August 10, 2011. With Gowen's assistance, Iron and Hobo defeated Sex Appeal for the PWO Tag Team Championship, Iron's first title. The Handicapped Heroes - Iron (left) and Zach Gowan - at an independent show in April 2014 In 2012, Iron and Gowen would form a tag team calling themselves \\"The Handicapped Handguns\\". The two would defeat The Dead Wrestling Society in January 2013 to become the Prime Tag Team Champions. In March, both Gowen and Iron came to an agreement to change their tag team name to the \\"Handicapped Heroes\\" mainly due to the number of school shootings that occurred earlier in the year for they did not want to promote any form of violence. The next month, Gowen would be kicked-out of a show in the famous Agora Theatre and Ballroom by Prime Wrestling Commissioner, Vic Travagliante. This would leave Iron to defend the tag titles on his own, allowing him to be defeated by The Brotherhood of Mushtachioed Brawlers. On June 13, Iron lost against his former tag team partner, Matthew Justice at a show in Lisbon, Ohio for the Prime TV Championship. Iron is perhaps best known as a wrestler for his feud with Gargano, the tag-team defeat of Sex Appeal, and for a Chikara match with Lince Dorado in August, 2010, during the eighth Young Lions Cup - in which \\"a handicapped underdog [tried] to overcome the bully, and the crowd loved it!\\" On July 23, 2011, Iron's career jumped out of relative obscurity: after partnering in a tag match with Colt Cabana, Iron remained in the ring a few moments, and was surprised by Cabana's return to the ring with WWE Champion CM Punk.Babinsack, J. \\"Joe Babinsack look at Gregory Iron\\", \\"Figure Four Weekly\\", July 27, 2011, accessed July 27, 2011. Punk had this to say about Iron:Marvez, Alex. \\"Marvez: A dream night for Gregory Iron\\", \\"Scripps- Howard News Service\\", July 27, 2011, accessed July 27, 2011. During a live national interview on Fox and Friends, Iron talked about the challenges he's overcome, and issued a challenge of his own: either the WWE adds him to its 2012 Royal Rumble, or Vince McMahon meets Iron in the ring one-on-one. The WWE did not respond to the challenge; and Iron did not appear in the 2012 Rumble. Gregory Iron with Veda Scott In mid-2012, Iron experienced an unexpected loss of fan support, leading to a tirade at an Absolute Intense Wrestling show, after a tag match in which Iron and Cabana lost to Prohibition and Matt Cross - a match in which Iron was the only one of the four participants not supported by most of the fans. This led to a feud between Iron and Absolute Intense Wrestling, in which Iron sought the help of Veda Scott as his \\"legal advisor\\" \\\\- the assistance of Scott resulted in AIW adopting an \\"accommodation\\" for Iron's disability: to be defeated, he would have to be pinned by four-count instead of three. During a September card, Iron was pinned by Prohibition for a three-count, but while Scott reminded Prohibition of the new rule, Iron rolled him up for the win. Iron worked so well with Scott that they formed a tag-team, defeating The Batiri (Obariyon and Kodama) in November 2012 for the AIW Tag Team Championships. Iron frequently wore a T-shirt similar to the one CM Punk wore throughout the year of 2011 and in the beginning of 2012. It instead had a handicapped symbol in the center rather than the letter X on the back of a hand. On the back of the shirt it said \\"Best Disabled Wrestler In The World\\", the nickname Iron has been using for himself since November 2012. Iron was the subject of a special report by newscaster Chris Van Vliet of Cleveland's WOIO-TV Channel 19, entitled \\"An Iron Will.\\" This report won an Emmy for Best Single Sports Story in June, 2012. In 2013, he was unsuccessful in winning his bracket to continue in TNA's Gutcheck Challenge, although he did come in third place. On October 20, 2013, The Handicapped Heroes regained the Prime Tag Team Championship.

Mitchell and Levi Siebenhauer. From their place of business on 116 Front Street, the firm Meyerfeld, Mitchell and Siebenhauer engaged in the manufacturing of cigars and as wholesalers of wines and liquors.San Francisco, California Directories, 1889-91 Through this enterprise Meyerfeld would be placed in a position within a few years to assume ownership of the city's financially strapped Orpheum Theatre. Also known as the Orpheum Opera House, the 3,500 seat venue on O'Farrell Street between Stockton and Powell was built by Gustav Walter in 1887 and was for a time the most luxurious theater in the West.The Papers of Will Rogers: From Vaudeville to Broadway, September 1908 - August 1915 - by Will Rogers edited by Arthur Frank Wertheim and Barbara Bair (2001) pg. 53‚Äì55 Walter, a native of Prussia, became successful at the Orpheum putting on variety shows that appealed to wide audiences often with exotic acts from the East Coast and Europe rarely seen in the West. With his success in San Francisco Walter began to expand his organization, by then known as the Orpheum Circuit, to include leases on theaters in Los Angeles and Kansas City. In 1897 Walter turned the Orpheum into a vaudeville‚Äìonly venue and shortly thereafter became overextended and was unable to pay the Orpheum's $50,000 liquor bill owed to the firm Meyerfeld, Mitchell and Siebenhauer.Vaudeville, Old and New (2007) By Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly pg 84-85 Accounts differ on whether Walter lost total control of his organization at this point or was able to continue with Meyerfeld as a principle partner and investor.The Papers of Will Rogers: From Vaudeville to Broadway, September 1908 - August 1915 - by Will Rogers edited by Arthur Frank Wertheim and Barbara Bair (2001) pg. 455My First Love Wears Two Masks By Dora Barrett, Rose Cordeiro Miller - 1981 - pg.151 Meyerfeld did become the head of the Orpheum Circuit the following year when Gustav Walter died in Los Angeles while being prepared for an emergency appendectomy operation.The Los Angeles Times ‚Äì May 10, 1898 pg. 5 Meyerfeld had the means to purchase the outstanding shares of the Orpheum Circuit from Walter's heirs before launching an aggressive expansion of their operation west of the Mississippi River with the help of Martin Beck, his gifted general manager. By 1911 the Orpheum Circuit had grown to be the largest in the West, owning outright twelve grand theaters with leases on dozens more. Meyerfeld was credited with bringing \\"modern vaudeville\\" to the Western United States with quality entertainment performed in palatial theaters. He was, if not the first, one of the first showmen in the region to pay his talent's traveling expenses to lure vaudeville acts west.The Stage in the Twentieth Century: third volume (1912) By Robert Grau pg. 190 Meyerfeld was admired by his contemporaries as a good manager who ran a model business organization.The Overland Monthly ‚Äì Volume 8 ‚Äì 1911 pg. 352 According to his New York Times obituary, San Franciscans considered Meyerfeld \\"the Rockefeller of Vaudeville\\". In the early 1900s Meyerfeld and Beck formed an alliance with United Booking Offices, an organization that came about following a merger between the B. F. Keith and F.F.

The new company was to be called Orpheum Circuit Consolidated (later Orpheum Circuit Inc.) and would operate some fifty venues including every major vaudeville house west of the Mississippi River between Chicago and New Orleans and as far north as Western Canada In 1920 Martin Beck became president of Orpheum Circuit Inc. and Morris Meyerfeld Chairman of the Board, a largely ceremonial position that ended his day-to-day involvement in the operation. Faced with declining vaudeville audiences, Orpheum Circuit Inc. merged with the Keith-Albee Circuit in 1928 to form a national chain with some two hundred major venues coast-to-coast. Later that year Keith-Albee-Orpheum merged with David Sarnoff's Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to form Radio-Keith-Orpheum Pictures (RKO Pictures).Life Magazine - January 25, 1963 - pg. 67 The original Orpheum Theatre was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was rebuilt three years later near the same site.

Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) lies between the towns of Robe and Beachport. It includes the following lakes listed in order from north to south - Hawdon, Robe, Eliza, St Clair and George, and the area extending for a distance of inland from each in order to include habitat used by critically endangered orange-bellied parrots.

Criteria for nomination as an IBA The wetland system was identified by BirdLife International as an IBA because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stint, and often of sharp-tailed sandpipers, double-banded plovers and banded stilts. It also provides habitat for orange-bellied parrots, Australasian bitterns, rufous bristlebirds and striated fieldwrens. The adjacent beaches and offshore islets, from Cowrtie Island to Baudin Rocks, sometimes support breeding fairy terns.

Club career Torre Annunziata Born in Torre Annunziata, near Napoli, Alfredo started his playing career with his hometown club, Calcio Azzurri di Torre Annunziata. He played there until he was 14, when Calcio Catania sporting director Pietro Lo Monaco scouted the player and signed him. Catania After transferring to Catania, Donnarumma played for all levels of the club's youth setup and in 2008 joined the Primavera U-20 team of Catania, the highest youth level below the first team. He formed a great partnership with Alessandro Malafronte and most notably Francesco Nicastro during his time within Catania's youth program. He also scored 16 goals in his final youth season at the club. His senior playing career began in 2009, when the attacker earned first-team call-ups towards the end of the 2009‚Äì10 Serie A campaign, at the age of 18. Despite failing to make his Serie A debut with the club, the player graduated the club's youth set-up at the conclusion of the 2009‚Äì10 season. In July 2010, Donnarumma was loaned out to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side, A.S. Gubbio 1910 in order to earn regular playing experience. During his spell with the third division club, Donnarumma made 23 league appearances, scoring 5 league goals. In his 25 official matches for the Gubbio, Donnarumma was a part of the starting lineup 22 times. On 30 June 2011, Donnarumma returned to Catania, where he remained until 30 January 2012, when he was sent out on loan to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side, Virtus Lanciano after failing to make his Catania debut. With the Lanciano-based club, Donnarumma spent time with the senior squad as well as the youth team. With the youth side, Donnarumma scored 8 goals in just 8 appearances, while with the first team, he failed to have the same impact. During the ritorno of the 2011‚Äì12 Lega Pro campaign, he appeared just 10 times for the club, all as a substitute. After again returning to Sicily, Donnarumma was asked to go out on loan once more prior to the 2012‚Äì13 Serie A season. He transferred to Calcio Como on 11 July 2012, and had a successful season with the team. He was virtually ever-present for the third division club, appearing in 29 league matches (27 of which were starts) and scoring 14 league goals. Alfredo Donnarumma returned to Catania on 30 June 2013. Cittadella On 2 September 2013, Donnarumma was officially sold on a co-ownership basis to A.S. Cittadella for a peppercorn fee of five hundred euro.Calcio Catania S.p.A. bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian), PDF purchased from Italian C.C.I.A.A. In June 2014 Cittadella signed Donnarumma outright. Pescara & Teramo In summer 2014 Donnarumma was signed by Pescara. In the same year he was loaned to Teramo. On 17 July 2015, Donnarumma was signed by Teramo outright. However, the Serie B newcomer was expelled due to match-fixing. Salernitana On 31 August 2015, Donnarumma was sold to Salernitana. Empoli On 11 July 2017, Donnarumma was signed by Empoli from Salernitana. He helped Empoli win the Serie B title and achieve promotion to Serie A during the 2017‚Äì18 season, forming a prolific attacking partnership with Francesco Caputo; together, the pair scored 49 goals, finishing as the top two scorers in the league, with Donnarumma scoring 23 goals and Caputo 26. Brescia On 13 July 2018, Donnarumma signed with Brescia. Donnarumma won the 2018‚Äì19 Serie B title with Brescia, finishing the season as the league's top scorer with 25 goals, thus helping the club to achieve promotion to Serie A. On 25 August 2019, Donnarumma made his Serie A debut, also scoring his first goal in the Italian top flight, in a 1‚Äì0 away win over Cagliari. Style of play Although he primarily plays off of another forward as a second striker, Donnarumma is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed in the centre as a main striker, out wide as a winger, or even in a deeper, creative role as an attacking midfielder. A fast forward with good technique, dribbling skills in one on one situations, link-up play, and an ability to read the game, his biggest strengths as a player are his tenacity, bravery, tactical intelligence, and work-rate off the ball, as well as his ability to create space with his movement, and provide depth to his team by holding up the ball for his teammates with his back to goal. Although he is known for his ability to create chances and provide assists for other players, he also possesses a keen eye for goal and, despite not being particularly tall or strong from a physical standpoint, is effective in the air, and is capable of scoring with either foot, as well as his head, despite being naturally right footed.

In 2012, the Beacon Center was involved in repealing Tennessee's estate tax. Beacon has advocated reducing or eliminating Tennessee's sales taxes on groceries, cigarettes, and gasoline.

Report on Al Gore's house In 2007 TCPR issued a report asserting that Al Gore's residence in the Nashville area used more than 20 times the energy of a typical home in the United States. Reporters who followed up on the allegations found that Gore's house did use more electricity than a typical home, but they also found that it was about 12 times the average for Nashville (not 20 times, as reported by TCPR), pointed out that the building functioned both as a residence and a business office for both Al and Tipper Gore, it was much larger than a typical home, and that Gore made substantial improvements to the home during 2007 that reduced its electricity consumption.

This church was founded by Dominican priests in 1596 to serve their Chinese converts to Christianity. The original building was destroyed in 1762 by British bombardment. A new granite church was completed on the same site in 1852 however it was greatly damaged during the Second World War, with only the western fa√ßade and the octagonal belfry surviving. Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, who was born of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, trained in this church and afterwards went as a missionary to Japan, where he and his companions were martyred for refusing to renounce Christianity. Lorenzo is the Philippines' first saint, and was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1987. A large statue of the saint stands in front of the church. Masses are held in Filipino, Mandarin, Hokkien, and English. At present, the parish priest and rector is Rev. Fr. Andy O. Lim. Historical background Parish church of the barrio of Binondo in 1868 Even before the arrival of the Spanish to the Philippines there was already a community of Chinese traders living in Manila. The population of Chinese traders increased with the advent of Spanish colonization of the Philippines, due to increased trade between the islands. The upsurge in their population prompted the Catholic Missionaries to manage the conversion of the Chinese population to the Christian faith. In 1596, Dominican priests founded Binondo church to serve their Chinese converts to Christianity as well as to the native Filipinos. Architecture It was built by the Dominicans. Founded in 1596, a church had been constructed before 1614. When transferred to its present site in the 18th century, a new church was built to accommodate new churchgoers. In 1778, the roof was replaced with nipa as the wood was destroyed by termites. In 1863, the church was slightly damaged by earthquake. The original structure has sustained damages during wars and various natural disasters. Domingo Cruz y Gonzales supervised the construction of the dome in 1781. The current granite church was completed on the same site in 1852 and features an octagonal pagoda-like bell tower which suggests the Chinese culture of the parishioners. The church was burned during the British invasion of 1762. Another one was quickly built following the occupation. Improvements were made in the 18th century but the edifice was again destroyed in the 1863 earthquake. It was rebuilt in the grandeur the remains on which we see today. Before the war, it was considered as one of the most beautiful churches in the country. Its bell tower was composed of five stories, octagonal in shape. At its top was a mirador (viewing window). This roof was destroyed during the 1863 earthquake. American bombing on September 22, 1944 destroyed the structure. Everything including the archives of the parish were burned. Nothing was left behind except the stone walls of the church and the fire- tiered octagonal belltower. After the war, Binondo parishioners had to make do with a roofless church for several years until it was rebuilt in the 1950s. The roof behind the pediment and the walls at the left of the facade are additions in the past years. The original facade, with some few renovations, is similar to that of the Italian High Renaissance churches. The facade is buttressed on the sides by pilaster mass terminated by urn-like decorations. A tower is found at the apex of the pediment. At the base of the pediment, along its central axis, is a small circular window framed by smaller columns and pediment which are framed by a foliated scroll. At the right is the huge, octagonal tower characterized by cantons at its angles and pedimented window openings. The present church and convent was renovated between 1946 and 1971. Trivia *The altar of the church is loosely modeled after the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. *Binondo Church has been reconstructed many times due to natural calamities and only the Bell Tower is what remained of the original 16th century structure, it has retained the classic architecture that makes the place a wondrous sight for the most unforgettable occasion. *Andr√©s Bonifacio and Gregoria de Jes√∫s were married through a Catholic ceremony in Binondo Church in March 1893 or 1894.

It is taken by mouth twice per day on an empty stomach. Common side effects are vomiting, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dry skin, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain (pain in the body affecting bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons and nerves), fever, acneiform rash (acne), stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), headache, paronychia (infection in the skin that surrounds a toenail or fingernail) and pruritus (itching).  Mechanism of action  The gene BRAF is part of the MAPK/ERK pathway, a chain of proteins in cells that communicates input from growth factors. Activating mutations in the BRAF gene, primarily V600E (meaning that the amino acid valine in position 600 is replaced by glutamic acid), are associated with lower survival rates in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Another type of mutation that leads to undue activation of this pathway occurs in the gene KRAS and is found in NSCLC. A possibility of reducing the activity of the MAPK/ERK pathway is to block the enzyme MAPK kinase (MEK), immediately downstream of BRAF, with the drug selumetinib. More specifically, selumetinib blocks the subtypes MEK1 and MEK2 of this enzyme.  Adverse effects  Selumetinib can also cause serious side effects including heart failure (manifested as ejection fraction decrease, or when the muscle of the left ventricle of the heart is not pumping as well as normal) and eye toxicity (acute and chronic damage to the eye) including retinal vein occlusion, retinal pigment epithelial detachment and impaired vision. Cardiac and ophthalmic assessments should be performed prior to initiating selumetinib and at regular intervals during treatment. Selumetinib can also cause increased creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). CPK is an enzyme found in the heart, brain and skeletal muscles. When muscle tissue is damaged, CPK leaks into a person's blood. CPK elevation in one receiving selumetinib should prompt an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle due to direct or indirect muscle injury). Selumetinib should be withheld, dosage reduced or dosage permanently discontinued based on the severity of adverse reactions. Further, selumetinib contains vitamin E, and users are at an increased risk of bleeding if their daily intake of vitamin E exceeds the recommended or safe limits.  Pregnancy  Based on findings from animal studies, selumetinib may cause harm to a newborn baby when administered to a pregnant woman. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell females of reproductive age, and males with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment with selumetinib, and for one week after the last dose.  Possible uses  Treatment of neurofibromas in those with neurofibromatosis. In addition to thyroid cancer, BRAF-activating mutations are prevalent in melanoma (up to 59%), colorectal cancer (5‚Äì22%), serous ovarian cancer (up to 30%), and several other tumor types. Selumetinib has also been shown to inhibit growth of GNAQ mutated uveal melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest that selumetinib treatment of uveal melanoma patients can result in tumor shrinkage as the consequence of sustained inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. KRAS mutations appear in 20 to 30% of NSCLC cases and about 40% of colorectal cancer. A Phase II clinical trial about selumetinib in NSCLC was completed in September 2011; one about cancers with BRAF mutations is ongoing . In July 2015, selumetinib failed a Phase III trial testing whether the drug significantly prolonged the survival of patients in a study on melanoma originating in the eye. In the 152-patient trial, a combination of selumetinib and dacarbazine failed to improve progression-free survival compared with just the old drug alone. , there were other phase III trials registered for thyroid cancer, and KRAS Positive NSCLC. The combination of selumetinib to chemotherapy improved median progression-free survival}} in a trial of 510 patients with advanced KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) just for one month, which was statistically not significant. In November 2018, investigators working with nasal polyp tissue in vitro demonstrated a synergistic effect of down regulating expression of p-MEK1 and p-ERK1 when it was administered with erythromycin.  History  Selumetinib was discovered by Array BioPharma and was licensed to AstraZeneca. It has been investigated for the treatment of various types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. In April 2020, selumetinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Selumetinib is approved specifically for children who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which are tumors involving the nerve sheaths (coating around nerve fibers) and can grow anywhere in the body, including the face, extremities, areas around the spine and deep in the body where they may affect organs. Selumetinib is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it functions by blocking a key enzyme, which results in helping to stop the tumor cells from growing. NF1 is a rare, progressive condition caused by a mutation or flaw in a particular gene. NF1 is usually diagnosed in early childhood and appears in an estimated one out of every 3,000 infants. It is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), neurologic and skeletal impairments and risk for development of benign and malignant tumors throughout life. Between 30% and 50% of children born with NF1 develop one or more PNs. Selumetinib is the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat this debilitating, progressive and often disfiguring rare disease that typically begins early in life. The FDA approved selumetinib based on a clinical trial (NCT01362803) conducted by the National Cancer Institute of children who had NF1 and inoperable PN (defined as a PN that could not be completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity to the subject). The efficacy results were from 50 of the subjects who received the recommended dose and had routine evaluations of changes in tumor size and tumor-related morbidities during the trial. Subjects received selumetinib 25 mg/m2 orally twice a day until disease progression or until they experienced unacceptable adverse reactions. The clinical trial measured the overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of subjects with a complete response and those who experienced more than a 20% reduction in PN volume on MRI that was confirmed on a subsequent MRI within 3‚Äì6 months. The ORR was 66% and all subjects had a partial response, meaning that no subjects had complete disappearance of the tumor. Of these subjects, 82% had a response lasting 12 months or longer. The trial was conducted at four sites in the United States. Other clinical outcomes for subjects during selumetinib treatment including changes in PN-related disfigurement, symptoms and functional impairments. Although the sample sizes of subjects assessed for each PN-related morbidity (such as disfigurement, pain, strength and mobility problems, airway compression, visual impairment and bladder or bowel dysfunction) were small, there appeared to be a trend of improvement in PN- related symptoms or functional deficits during treatment. The FDA granted the application for selumetinib priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations. It was granted a rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of pediatric NF1 along with a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The FDA granted approval of Koselugo to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP.

The film is about So-yeon (Park Min-young), who works at a small pet-grooming shop called Kitty N Puppy. So-yeon has claustrophobia and starts having apparitions of a ghostly young girl with cat- like eyes (Kim Ye-ron). Plot So-yeon works as a groomer in a pet shop, but has claustrophobia due to childhood trauma. A woman comes to the pet shop to collect her Persian cat, Bidanyi. The next day, the woman is found dead in an elevator, but Bidanyi is unharmed. The police are unable to determine the cause of her death. So-yeon's friend Kim Jun-seok, one of the police officers investigating the murder, gives her Bidanyi to look after. So-yeon starts to have nightmares of a young girl with cat-like eyes and is haunted by hallucinations. Jun-seok and his fellow officers watch CCTV footage of the woman who died and it's concluded that she died of a panic attack. So-yeon's friend Bo-hee, who recently adopted a cat, is killed in her closet by the cat- eyed girl. That night, So-yeon cuts her finger while preparing food for Bidanyi. Bidanyi licks the blood and becomes aggressive. The next day, she takes Bidanyi to the dead woman's husband, but he does not want him. He explains that his wife claimed to be haunted by a strange little girl. Disturbed, So-yeon leaves Bidanyi in a park. At the animal shelter, a staff member cremates a dead cat, but is pulled inside the furnace and burns to death. Jun-seok and So-yeon go to the animal shelter, where they find dead cats and the charred remains of the staff member. They learn that some time ago, there was an infestation of stray cats in the boiler room of an apartment complex. The doors and windows were cemented shut and the cats were left to suffocate. Two weeks later, workers removed the dead cats. So-yeon remarks the similarity of the murder victims all being found dead in a small space. She is again approached by an confused old woman she had encountered before, who is looking for her granddaughter. Jun-seok discovers that the old woman reported her missing granddaughter nine months ago, but her son closed the case. So- yeon escorts the woman back to her apartment - in the same complex where the stray cats lived in the boiler room - and Jun-seok gives her a photo of the granddaughter, who looks exactly like the cat-eyed girl. So-yeon sees the old woman's son beating his mother; he is then killed by a horde of cats. So-yeon goes to the complex's boiler room and is confronted by cats. So-yeon falls into a large canister. The cat-eyed girl appears and shows her how she died; she had played with the cats in the boiler room, and upon hearing of the plans to kill them, she attempted to hide them in the canister. While climbing out, she fell and was paralysed, dying with the cats after the door and windows were cemented. Having conquered her claustrophobia, So-yeon visits her father in a mental hospital, riding in an elevator for the first time without panicking. As she leaves, she and Ju-seok find a kitten underneath their car, and she kindly beckons toward it.

The film features Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha and Juhi Chawla in lead roles and released on 13 November 2012. Salman Khan appears in a cameo role. It is a remake of the Telugu movie Maryada Ramanna (inspired by Our Hospitality a 1923 silent comedy film directed by and starring Buster Keaton) directed by S. S. Rajamouli. Although competing with the Yash Raj film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, Son of Sardaar managed to do good business at the box office worldwide. Box Office India declared it a Hit in India and an average grosser in the overseas markets. It went on to gross worldwide. Plot There is a massive rivalry between the Sandhus and the Randhawas. In a massive fight between the 2 families, Jaswinder Singh Randhawa's \\"Jassi\\" (Ajay Devgn) father dies and Balwinder Singh Sandhu's \\"Billu\\" (Sanjay Dutt) uncle dies. That happened during Billu's wedding with Pammi (Juhi Chawla). However, the wedding was incomplete. So Billu makes a vow. The vow is to not get married until he kills Randhawa's son, which is Jassi. Jassi's mother dies as well, eventually. 25 years later, Jassi is a grown up Sikh man who is a struggling immigrant in London. He is best friends with Pathan (Salman Khan). Jassi has to go to India because his father left him some land in Phagwara, Punjab. However, Jassi is informed about the rivalry but he does not worry about it as he thinks that the rivalry is now forgotten. In Phagwara, Billu still searches for Randhawa's son with the help of his two younger brothers. They are called Titu (Vindu Dara Singh) and Tony (Mukul Dev). Pammi yearns to complete her incomplete marriage. Jassi arrives at India and meets Sukhmeet Kaur Sandhu \\"Sukh\\" (Sonakshi Sinha) on a train ride from New Delhi to Phagwara. Sukh is the sister of Billu. She is coming back to Phagwara as she has completed her studies in Delhi. During the train ride, Jassi falls in love with her. At Phagwara, Tony gives Jassi a ride to a Gurdwara as the land behind the Gurdwara is Jassi's. Tony finds out that Jassi is Randhawa's son and tries to kill him. But Tony is unsuccessful. Jassi meets Billu in a temple as the villagers tell Jassi that Billu will tell him all about the land. Billu is accompanied by his family and Sukh. Sukh and Jassi meet and Billu invites Jassi to his house. Tony then tells Billu that Jassi is the person they were searching for these 25 years. Billu will kill Jassi as soon as he gets out of the Sandhu household. Jassi finds out that he is in the Sandhu household. Only Billu and his brothers know that he is Randhawa's son. There is a tradition in the Sandhu household. The tradition is that 'guests are akin to God and there will be no killing in the house'. So in order to stay in the house, Jassi acts out that he has broken his back. For treatment, he has to stay in the house and therefore he is safe. Billu becomes extremely angry. Sukh has a friend called Bobby (Arjan Bajwa). He is a doctor and finds out that Jassi has not broken his back. He doesn't tell anyone besides Sukh. One day, Jassi informs the police that Billu and his brothers will kill him. So a policeman (Puneet Issar) escorts Jassi out of the house safely. Billu follows them. The policeman takes Jassi into an old building and Jassi finds out that the Policeman was with Billu. The policeman leaves Jassi with Billu and his group who are carrying swords. By fighting them, Jassi escapes. Due to him escaping, he eventually reaches the Sandhu household again. After some days of Jassi staying in the house, it is Lohri. During the celebration, the engagement of Bobby and Sukh is announced. Bobby and Sukh go against this decision but they eventually agree. The engagement was going to happen the next day. Jassi finds out that Sukh loves him. On the next day, the engagement takes place. Pammi tells Sukh and Bobby that she planned this engagement because she wanted Jassi to escape as the engagement is taking place in the Gurdwara, nobody will be in the Sandhu household. Pammi tells Sukh that Jassi is Randhawa's son. Jassi meanwhile, decides to fight Billu's brothers so he can stop this rivalry. Sukh escapes from the engagement and goes to Jassi. She wants to elope with him but Jassi wishes to end this rivalry, no matter what. Jassi fights Billu. However, the Sandhus tell Billu that he should forget about this rivalry. So Billu forgives Jassi only on one condition. The condition is that he will take care of Sukh after marriage. Jassi agrees and now the Randhawa-Sandhu rivalry is forgotten.

S. Rajamouli starring Sunil and Saloni Aswani in lead roles. In an interview, director Ashwni Dhir replied that it was only the plot that was remade; the rest was changed. Maryada Ramanna has also been remade in Kannada as Maryade Ramanna starring Komal Kumar and Nisha Shah, and in Bengali as Faande Poriya Boga Kaande Re starring Soham Chakraborty and Srabanti Chatterjee. In fact, each and every antic in Son of Sardaar is prominently depicted in the Bengali remake. The movie was also re-made in Tamil Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham starring comedian Santhanam in a hero role with newcomer Ashna Zaveri as the heroine. The movie was also remade in Malayalam as Ivan Maryadaraman starring Malayalam actor Dileep in the hero role with Nikki Galrani as the heroine. Production was spent on making Son of Sardar. However, an all-inclusive price tag of was also announced in the media. The Punjabi Cultural Heritage Board raised disagreements due to some objection regarding certain scenes and dialogues. The producer and lead actor Ajay Devgn understood the objections and edited the scenes. \\"The creativity of the film has not been affected in any way. Every film is rectified, sometimes it's made even better,\\" said Devgn during a press conference. \\"The objectionable things were very small. The writer and director of the film is Punjabi and we took care of things. Even the guy who tied my turban was from Punjab\\", he added. Release Son of Sardaar released in 2,000 screens in India and 350 screens overseas. Son of Sardaar got 300 more screens in its second week. Two weeks before Diwali, Ajay Devgn FFilms sent an intimation notice to Yash Raj Films through their lawyer at the Competition Commission of India. The notice accused Yash Raj Films of monopolistic business practices and stated that they used \\"their dominant position in the Bollywood film market\\" to secure many high quality single- screens for their release Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Yash Raj Films responded by saying that they were shocked and questioned Devgn's motives. The studio dismissed Devgn's claim that high-quality single-screens were unavailable by pointing out that they had only booked 1,500 single-screens for Jab Tak Hai Jaan out of the 10,500 available in India. The studio added that Ajay could have changed the release of his film as Yash Chopra announced on 27 June 2011 Jab Tak Hai Jaan would come out on Diwali 2012. Ajay announced the date of Son of Sardaar on 29 May 2012 and finalised distribution deals on 4 October 2012. He had a year to avoid a simultaneous release. Lastly, Yash Raj Films stated it was unfair to say they were in a dominant position. The studio only released a handful of films in 2012 while the makers of Son of Sardaar, Viacom 18 and Eros International, released dozens the same year. After the statement made by Yash Raj Films, Ajay Devgn responded by saying he only managed to book 600 single-screens for Son of Sardaar and would take legal action if not allotted more. He denied having anything against Shahrukh Khan and said that distributors cannot be allowed to enter into an arrangement which adversely affects competition. Yash Raj Films entered into a tie-in arrangement with exhibitors that made it compulsory for them to show an untitled Yash Chopra film on Diwali and keep it in cinemas for at least two weeks thereafter. Devgn claimed that this violated provisions of the 2002 Indian Competition Act. Senior film critic Vinod Mirani said that YRF's move of blocking single screens may not help much. \\"Single screens watchers will have more affinity towards an action film such as SOS. Moreover, JTHJ's length and the fact that music has still not picked up, will not go down well with the movie goers.\\"'Jab Tak Hai Jaan' will release in 3,000 cinemas across India. http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/yrfs-jab-tak-hai-jaan-set-to- openclose-to-3000-screens-in-india/492016/ The Competition Commission dismissed the case against Yash Raj Films on 6 November 2012. Ajay Devgn has appealed to Competition Appellate Tribunal after rejection of petition against Yash Raj Films. The Competition Appellate tribunal bench headed by chairman Justice V. S. Sirpurkar refused Devgn's stay against Jab Tak Hai Jaan but stated that the case against Yash Raj Films will be reviewed again. Both films were released on 13 November 2012. Reception Critical reception Son of Sardaar received mixed to negative reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it a score of 4 out of 5 stars and said \\"Son of Sardaar is for lovers of hardcore masala movies. If you liked Wanted, Dabangg and Rowdy Rathore, chances are you will relish Son of Sardaar as well. The North Indian audiences in particular and those residing abroad will be simply delighted by this chatpata, masaledaar fare.\\" Gayatri Sankar of Zee News gave it 3 out of 5 stars while commenting \\"Certain portions are a bit of a drag, but the comic sequences will make up for the monotony. The cast has put up a good show. Overall, SOS is worth a watch, a complete family entertainer.\\" Rediff gave 2 out of 5 and stated Son of Sardaar has a lot for the masses but it lacks a good story. Filmfare gave 2 out of 5 stars and stated \\"Comedy is more than just gags and slapstick. Sadly SOS gets it wrong.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 2 out of 5 stars and stated Son of Sardaar \\"is only sporadically entertaining, and peddles the same tired stereotypes of Punjab and Sikhs. A cameo by Salman Khan, sadly, doesn't make up for the film's many flaws.\\" Hindustan Times gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as \\"exhausting, painfully loud and way too long, with too few laughs\\", while the Telegraph stated that it was \\"run-of-the-mill\\", but that it could be a \\"guilty pleasure\\" for some viewers. Like the Hindustan Times, IBNLive gave the movie 2 out of 5, with a slightly lower grade coming from Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV, who rated the film 1.5 out 5, stated that it was \\"A tangled mess that has no way of working its way around the sloppy screenplay.\\" The Hindu stated that there's nothing more torturous than watching an unfunny film that's trying so hard to be funny. Box office India Son of Sardaar had opening of around 70% on average at multiplexes, especially in North India. The single screens opening was similar. It earned around on its opening day. It shows very good growth of 70% with a collection of around net on its second day. It netted nett in its first three-day weekend. Son of Sardaar net grossed in first five days of release.

Only one song, \\"Yeh Jo Halki Halki Khumariya\\", composed by Sajid-Wajid was also included in the album. Track listing Soundtrack reception The album received mixed to positive reviews. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated that \\"Son of Sardaar lives up to its promise of a high-on- energy soundtrack with not many dull moments in its 50-odd minutes duration. \\" Koimoi gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"Overall this album is more than a decent affair where Punjabi 'tadka' makes it reasonably happening. While the tracks Son of Sardaar and Bichdann will certainly do well, Kabhi Kabhi Mere Dil Mein and Rani Tu Mein Raja also carry potential to make their presence felt.\\" IBNLive gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"The album is woven around the theme of the film and manages to justify it well, although the sound gets a bit monotonous at times.\\" Sequel In May 2015, Ajay Devgn posted on Twitter: \\"Sorry yaar, duniya bekar bina Son of Sardaar!\\" Devgn, shared a poster of the film 'Sons of Sardaar: The Battle of Saragari' in July 2016.

Construction was carried out in the Yugoslav aircraft factories Zmaj and Rogo≈æarski between 1928 and 1932. Design and development Rudolf Fizir designed a biplane reconnaissance aircraft during the first war of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (KSHS) during 1925. It was equipped with a 260 hp Maybach engine and the prototype was made in the workshop of the Novi Sad Air Aviation Regiment. The prototype was first flown in late November 1925 by test pilot Vladimir Stri≈æevski. Further development of the basic Fizir design was undertaken with the assistance of Du≈°an Stankov resulting in the construction of five additional prototypes and the delivery of 32 production machines designated Fizir F1V (commonly referred to as \\"Fizir-Maybach 260 hp\\") over the next three years. While these had been built at the Rogo≈æarski factory, Zmaj built 15 of the Fizir F1V-Wright version and 5 Jupiter-engined Fizir F1M floatplanes for Naval Aviation in 1930. Zmaj was also responsible for conversion of several Fizir-Maybach trainers to Lorraine-Dietrich engines in 1932, which extended the service life of these machines under the new name Fizir-Lorraine 400 hp. Operational history Just after the factory tests, on 8 October 1926 pilot Vladimir Stri≈æevski flew the aircraft from Novi Sad to Skopje to Mostar to Rajlovac (Sarajevo) to Zagreb and returned to Novi Sad - a distance of 1,410 km - over a period of 8 hours and 40 minutes.\\"–ó–Ω–∞—á–∞—ò–∞–Ω —É—Å–ø–µ—Ö –Ω–∞—à–µ –∞–≤–∏—ò–∞—Ç–∏–∫–µ\\" (in (Serbian)). –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ 12.10.1926.

As a result of this performance, the aircraft was entered in an international competition of the Little Entente in Poland where it was one of 14 entries. Though some of the other competitors had aircraft with twice the power, it came in first place. Thanks to this success and satisfactory test results, it was decided to put the Fizir F1V into serial production, but as an intermediate trainer rather than as a reconnaissance aircraft with the result that some changes were made, such as adding dual controls. Difficulties with supplies of the original Maybach engine resulted in a variety of other engines being fitted, from which the individual variants would derive their names. The Fizir F1V was used at the flying schools to transition pupils to reconnaissance and bomber aircraft, replacing the worn-out Hansa-Brandenburg C.I as production permitted. Twenty examples were produced by the end of the 1928 and 12 in 1929. The Fizir F1V aircraft used by the pilot schools were withdrawn from service and replaced with the new Zmaj Fizir FP-2 in 1936. Some examples of these aircraft had flown by the beginning of April and were still in use when war started in 1941 as a liaison aircraft or training. Last flight from the family of these types of aircraft Fizir F1M (Fizir first Navy) was a seaplane that was developed at \\"Zmaj\\" by Zemun on the request of the Navy Command for a reconnaissance seaplane on floats. Known as Zmaj Fizir-Jupiter or \\"Big Fizir\\" they were used in the Naval Air Force for as a reconnaissance seaplane and for towing targets for antiaircraft training. On one of these aircraft was fitted with an NACA ring in 1931 to improve the Jupiter engine's cooling and reduce drag. These aircraft flew during the war and three were captured by the Italians however it is unknown if they made any use of them.

She was the fourth child of Maruca de Avil√©s and Narciso Avil√©s and the younger sister of Salvadoran painter San Aviles (1932‚Äì1991). She admired her older brother's artwork from the time she was a young girl, anxious to follow in his footsteps; however she was unable to attend the art academy, leading her to later develop her art skills in a self-taught way. Against all odds, after raising her three boys alongside her husband (of now 50 years), she found herself artistically in her 30s where she rediscovered her love of art, developing into the renowned artist she was‚Äîhaving dedicated herself artistically to acrylic paintings on canvas for almost four decades.  Artistic periods  Her work is often compared to the Dutch Masters of the 17th century for her mastery of light and the art of chiaroscuro, the technique of contrasting light and shade in order to enhance shape, form, texture, and transparency. Oranges‚Äîher indisputable object of artistic focus‚Äîcenter in most of her current paintings due to their unmistakable multicolored tones that Ana Maria plays with, giving away her sentiment of sensuality in exploring the infinite possibilities of texture and color in her delicate traces on canvas. Ana Maria does not pretend to make a photographic copy of the natural fruit in her current paintings, rather she intends to capture their surrealistic essence through a rational composition of dots, blurs, spots, lights, and shadows‚Äîentering the world of magical hyperrealism of Ana Maria, a reality only existing in her imagination, which is given to her audience, elegantly showing also her profound knowledge and use of chiaroscuro. A similar thing happens when gazing upon her \\"grapes\\", featured three dimensionally with all their splendor...\\"and, likewise, every painting holds its secrets...\\". Primitive Period She began her career in the late 1960s in what is known in Spanish as her \\"Epoca Primitiva\\", which roughly translates to \\"Primitive Period\\" which began after she participated in a clay modeling course sponsored by the French embassy in San Salvador (1967‚Äì1968), where she made casts and polychrome pourings using many techniques including encaustics, which she would later use in paintings, combined with other contemporary techniques and materials. It was during this time that Ana Maria, inspired by Mayan and Colonial art, began the search for a style of her own where she could begin to express her message of \\"Spiritual peace and the joy of living\\". She focuses on regional landscapes and the traditions of Salvadoran folklore and its surroundings‚Äîfields of flowers and scenes with great architectonic ideas‚Äîall executed with great precision. In this period, carrying on until around 1982, she evolves very quickly, blending colors with the magic of the artist. Period of Walls In the next, albeit brief, period (1983‚Äì1984), known in Spanish as the \\"Epoca de Muros\\" (Roughly translating into \\"Period of Walls\\") Ana Maria seeks to evolve with other concepts and paints works which always contain walls‚Äîwith which she expresses the technical difficulties that she needed to overcome. Her brush lands on a stage where the focus is this architectonic element of a wall that needs to be surpassed‚Äîbecoming like a quintessential window that needs to be opened to let in the floral nature of its surroundings. She uses many animals during this time, mainly bees, which in an ironic play of events in life foreshadows a tragic event she would endure next to her husband. Romantic Period The \\"Romantic Period\\" (1986‚Äì1989), known as the \\"Epoca Romantica\\" in Spanish follows, where Ana Maria lets go of her casual primitivism and ventures inside the creation of harmonious and sophisticated shapes and forms. Her compositions are a blend of high reality elements with flowers of great splendor, exquisite fruits and erupting volcanoes. So fascinating is her artwork, that it is published to reflect the poetry of Salvadorean poet, Claudia Lars (actual name Carmen Brannon) in Tierra de Infancia. It is through this newfound technique that she creates a unique style of transparency and texture achieving the acrylic perfection she is known for today. The imaginative blend of colors and textures allows her to paint her iconic oranges, in all their brilliance, blended with the transparency of her grapes as a symbol of the artistic abundance of the great Salvadoran painter. Final Period, the Current Period This leads to her \\"Current Period\\", beginning in the early 1990s, where Ana Maria has been developing a novel technique using acrylic colors and wax, enabling her to paint images of great transparency and accomplish that unique finishing. In her paintings of modern \\"still life\\" and other compositions, Ana Maria wishes to express the abundance of this world in this point in time: the growth of people, traffic, the high production, lights, sounds and everything that affect people in their ordinary lives. By this principle, sometimes, some of her compositions almost touch the borders of opulence, although always keeping their elegance and harmony, where she wishes to expose the sense of belonging to an age of metaphysical ideas through a heavy dose of symbolism.  Recognition  Ana Maria's artwork has not only transcended geographical barriers, but her artwork has been considered within that of great Latin American Masters, most recently forming part of the permanent collection of the Nassau County Museum of Art in New York in January 2010. \\"Teatro de Naranjas (Theater of Oranges) (1991) by Salvadoran Ana Maria de Martinez lives up to its title by presenting the subject matter of still life in a highly theatrical way\\" Along her artistic career Ana Maria has received important acknowledgments of her work, such as \\"Distinguished Visitor\\" by the mayor of Miami, Florida, USA; \\"Certificate of Appreciation\\" by the city of Coral Gables, Florida, USA for her participation in the development of art and culture. Moreover, her work has been successfully auctioned at prestigious galleries worldwide, such as Sotheby's and Christie's New York, among others. *Sale of \\"Theater of Oranges\\" at Christie's New York: Thursday, May 19, 1994 [Lot 250] in LATIN AMERICAN PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, SCULPTURE AND PRINTS *Sale of \\"Mandarines\\" at Christie's New York: Wednesday, May 17, 1995 [Lot 249] in Important Latin American Pntgs, Draws & Sculpture *Sale of \\"Dead Nature with Oranges and Grapes\\" at Christie's New York: Tuesday, November 21, 1995 [Lot 257] in Important Latin American Pntgs, Draws & Sculpture Her works reside in highly prestigious museums and collections, such as the Duchess of Alba collection in Spain, the private collection of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, the permanent collection of contemporary painters of El Salvador in \\"Museo Marte\\" (the National Gallery of El Salvador) where she was featured as the \\"Artist of the Month\\" in February 2010, the exhibit \\"Latinas!\\" in Jan 2010 to Feb 28 2010, and the NCMA permanent collection, where \\"Theater of Oranges\\" has been added to the permanent collection of the Nassau County Museum of Art in New York. In 2007, Ana Maria's work was featured in the Latin Masters exhibition of the Nassau County Museum of Art in New York, alongside other world-renowned artists such as Frida Kahlo and Fernando Botero. Ana Maria's artwork has also been displayed in University exhibits such as \\"Exhibition: 'Latin American Modern Masters'\\" in the University of Pennsylvania, and some of her artwork has been reproduced by UNICEF. Her artwork has been present in various exhibitions in American (Latin America, USA, and Canada) and European cities. Additionally, the Government of Japan acquired two of her paintings, and in 1986, by invitation of the Government of Italy, Ana Maria participated in the Festival \\"Dei Due Mondi\\" that takes place every year in the city of Spoleto, Italy. Ana Maria has also been featured in newspapers, magazines, and television shows.  Death  Approaching 2013, Ana Mar√≠a dies from a disease that came charging since February 2008. The Carcinoid syndrome was her executioner on December 17, 2012. She leaves in 2010 her painting. In mid-2012, the artist falls, being fatal for her health, that drops suddenly. On the morning of the 17th, at 3:00 AM, approximately, she is declared dead in the name of the disease, she died with her loved ones.

Houtsma published the index volume to the Oriental Catalogue of the library at Leiden University, the Catalogus codicum orientalium Bibliothecae Academiae Lugduno-Batavae in 1875, and had worked closely with his senior, de Goeje, in enlarging its second edition, published in 1888. His first Oriental text was the Akhtal, Encommium Omayadarum (1878) of the Ummayad poet Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi.

The museum was founded in 1989 by the Letters and Arts Association of Kozani in commemoration of the February 1878 uprising, which took place in the region aiming to abrogate the treaty of San Stefano. The ultimate objective of the uprising was to prevent Macedonia from becoming part of Bulgaria, to throw off the Ottoman domination, and to be part of the Hellenic state. On Mt Bourinos, the ‚ÄúProvisional Government of the province of Elimeia in Macedonia‚Äù was formed, headed by Ioannis Goventaros from Kozani; its secretary was the teacher Anastasios Picheon from Ohrid, founding member of the ‚ÄúEducational Association of Kastoria‚Äù. Objects belonging to or associated with fighters are displayed in the interior exhibition area. Busts of 21 fighters, a monument to fallen heroes, as well as busts of Philip II, king of Macedonia, Alexander the Great and others are likewise on display in the open-air exhibition area. Within the museum‚Äôs boundaries there is also the restored church of Agios Nikolaos with splendid wall paintings and marble inscriptions around it, with maxims and epigrams from Greek history. Of historical significance is the fact that in this church in 1878 the guns of the revolt were blessed.

Life Born at Bovinger, Essex, on 30 October 1838, he was the eldest and only surviving son of William Macjanley Oliver, rector of Bovinger, by his wife Jane Weldon. He entered Eton College in 1853; and after passing through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he received a commission in the Royal Artillery on 1 April 1859. In the following year he went out with his battery to China, where hostilities had been renewed. The First Convention of Beijing was however signed soon after Oliver's arrival (24 October 1860), and his service was confined to garrison duty at Canton. On the establishment of a British embassy at Beijing in 1861 he accompanied General Sir John Michel on a visit to the capital, and subsequently made a tour through Japan. In the following year he was transferred to Mauritius; and from there with Major-general Johnstone on a mission to Madagascar to congratulate King Radama II on his accession. He spent some months exploring the island, and witnessed the king's coronation at Antananarivo (23 September). A second brief visit to the island followed in June 1863, when Oliver, after King Radama's assassination, was again despatched to Madagascar on board HMS Rapid. On his return to Mauritius he studied the flora and fauna of the Mascarene Islands. In 1864 the volcanic eruption on the island of R√©union gave him the opportunity of recording geological phenomena. Oliver returned to England with his battery in 1865. In 1867 he joined Captain Bedford Pim's exploring expedition to Central America. A route was cut and levelled across Nicaragua from Monkey Point to Port Realejo; and it was proposed that this route might be more practicable than that projected by Ferdinand de Lesseps for the Panama Canal. Oliver was promoted captain in 1871, and was appointed superintendent of fortifications on the Cornish coast in 1873. After serving on the staff of the intelligence branch of the quartermaster-general's department he was sent to St. Helena on garrison duty. There he made a collection of ferns, which he presented to the Royal Gardens, Kew. Later life Oliver resigned his commission in 1878. For a time he acted as correspondent of The Illustrated London News in Cyprus and Syria. In poor health from malaria, he settled to writing, at Gosport and then at Worthing. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1866, became Fellow of the Ethnological Society in 1869, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1874. He died at Worthing on 31 July 1907, and was buried at Findon. Works Oliver's sketch of the view from St Mawes Castle in 1875 At a meeting of the British Association at Dundee on 5 September 1867 Oliver read a paper on ‚ÄòTwo Routes through Nicaragua.' His diary of his journey, ‚ÄòRambles of a Gunner through Nicaragua' (privately printed, 1879), was subsequently embodied in a larger volume of reminiscences, entitled ‚ÄòOn and Off Duty' (1881). His volumes descriptive of Malagasy life became the standard English authority on the subject. In 1866 he published ‚ÄòMadagascar and the Malagasy,' a diary of his first visit to the island, which he illustrated with some spirited sketches. This was followed by an ethnological study in French, ‚ÄòLes Hovas et les autres tribus caract√©ristiques de Madagascar' (Guernsey, 1869). In ‚ÄòThe True Story of the French Dispute in Madagascar' (1885) Oliver criticised the treatment of the Malagasy by the French colonial officials. Finally his two volumes on ‚ÄòMadagascar' (1886), based on many sources, gave a detailed account of the island, its history, and its inhabitants. A drawing by Oliver of a stream of lava tumbling over a cliff was reproduced in John Wesley Judd's ‚ÄòVolcanoes, what they are and what they teach' (1881). From Guernsey, where he was appointed adjutant in 1868, he visited Brittany, and drew up a report on the prehistoric remains at Carnac and other sites (Proc. Ethnological Soc. 1871). In 1872 a tour in the Mediterranean resulted in arch√¶ological observations in Asia Minor, Greece, and Sardinia, published as ‚ÄòNuragghi Sardi, and other Non-Historic Stone Structures of the Mediterranean' (Dublin, 1875). He wrote on the history of two Cornish castles, ‚ÄòPendennis and St. Mawes' (Truro, 1875). Oliver also edited: * ‚ÄòMadagascar, or Robert Drury's Journal,' 1890. * ‚ÄòThe Voyage of Fran√ßois Leguat,' 1891 (Hakluyt Society). * ‚ÄòThe Memoirs and Travels of Mauritius Augustus Count de Benyowsky,' 1893. * ‚ÄòThe Voyages made by the Sieur Dubois,' 1897 (translation). In addition to these works he assisted in the preparation of ‚ÄòThe Life of Sir Charles MacGregor,' published by his wife in 1888, and from the notes and documents collected by Sir Charles MacGregor he compiled the abridged official account of ‚ÄòThe Second Afghan War, 1878‚Äì80' (posthumous, 1908). ‚ÄòThe Life of Philibert Commerson,' which appeared posthumously in 1909, was edited with a short memoir of Oliver by G. F. Scott Elliot. To the Dictionary of National Biography he contributed the articles on Fran√ßois Leguat and Sir Charles MacGregor.

It shares international borders with the Narowal District of Pakistani Punjab. It also shares borders with the Kathua District of Jammu and Kashmir and Chamba and Kangra districts of Himachal Pradesh. Hoshiarpur district shares a boundary with Pathankot in Eastern Punjab. The two main rivers ‚Äì Beas and Ravi, pass through the district. History In the vedic period monarchy was the form of government but from the Mahabharta period onwards we find traces of republic form of government in our country according to Mahabharta the present Himachal Pradesh was divided into a number of small tribal republics Panini (5th century B.C.)in his ashtadhayai mentioned some of the republics settled there. The Janpadas mentioned in the Mahabharta and also known to Panini are the Trigarthas, the kulutas and kulindas. In Shanti Parva and Sabha Parva of the Mahabharta (chapter 52)the name of the Audambra is found mentioned at the end of the list of republic Janpadas. It is stated that the rajas of Audumbra accompanied the rajas of kashmira, darda and trigarta to pay Nazaranas to the pandava king Yudhishtra (Mahabharta 2-52-13).the reference of the Audumbras is also find mentioned is Vishnu Puran, vayu Puran, Brihat Samihta, Satpatha Brahma and Ganpatha etc. The state of Audumbra was lying in between the two great rivers of Ancient times as Parushni or Aravati and Vipasa presently known as River Ravi & Beas comprising whole of the Nurpur Tehsil, Tehsil of Pathankot and a large tract of plains of district Gurdaspur with its capital at Pratishthan that is present Pathankot. Praishthan was probably one of the oldest sites in the Punjab ; Pratishthan (present Pathankot) was advantageously situated on the great commerce route of ancient times, which ran from Patliputra (Patna) of Magadha state to Takshashila and further to the central Asia under the foothills. During the invasion of Alexandra's in 326 B.C. the state of Audmbra was ruled by the Katha Kashatriyas, who enjoyed the highest reputation for still in the art of war. After crossing the river Ravi, Alexander entered the territory of Audumbra State and invested Sangala a strong hold of Kathas of whom Greek called Kathains or Kathoi. The Kathas fought with great dash and studborness so much so that even Pores had to come to the help of 'Alxander with his army of Elephants and 5000 soldiers and titled the scale of victory in his favour. 17,000 Kathas were killed and more than 70,000 were captured. This resolute resistance of the Kathas incensed Alexander to such an extent that Sangala was razed to ground. All this happened near the capital town of Pratisthan (the modern Pathankot). There is no trace of Sangala, HOWEVER A VILLAGE Sangram is available near Shahpur Kandi, Tehsil Pathankot. It may be the abbreviated forms of Sangala. The town Kathua on the east bank of Ravi and Kathgarh on western bank of River Beas seems to be inhabited by the Kathas to whom Greeks called Kathoi's. On reaching near Indoura (in District Kangra) - Kathgarh - Mirthal on the Beas, the army of Alexandera refused to go further on account of alarming reports of the Military strength of Magadh State. In deep disdain Alaxandra had to announce his historical retreat September 326 B.C. On the return of Alexandera, Audumbras again came into power and gained their strength. In the days of their prosperity Audumbra kings issued their coins. These early coins are thin pieces of copper either square or oblong. Their identity is marked by the symbols found on these coins such as Trident, Nandi Bull, Swastic and elephant etc. Some silver coins have also been issued by the Audumbra Kings. They were issued in the name of the community and king. These coins bear the name of the king as well as the state as Audumbrisa. Dharaghosa was probably the most famous and great king of the Audumbra republic. These coins remained in use till the fourth century A.D. Sir A. Cunnigham, first Director General of Archeological Survey of India discovered some Audumbra coins from Pathankot itself during the second half of the nineteenth century when he visited this place. In 1905 A.D. one Jhet Pal Tomar a younger brother of Anang Pal Tomar a king of Delhi travelled to this place and after giving defeat to Kazbak Khan established his own state called Paithan an abbreviated form of Pratishthan. Jhel Pal built a strong fort at Paithan (modern Pathankot) in the early 12th century which was demolished by the Britishers after the annexation of Punjab State. Another Fort at Shahpur (Kandi) was also built by a Pathania king named Bhakhat Mal in the 15th century. It seems to be a tradition that the ruling chief bears the distinctive appellation or clan named derived in almost every instance from the name of the country or from its capital over which they ruled following the old tradition the chief of the Paithan also adopted the clan name of his capital as Pathania which in later time became Paithania. The name of the city Paithan remained in use till 1759 A.D. The early Muhammadan historian, the Ain - I - Akbari, the Tuzuki - I - Jahangiri and Badshahnama, all called it Paithan. Thus it is mischievous to say that the city of Pathankot was founded by the some Pathan. Sir A. Cunnigham in his Archeological Survey report of 1872-72 clearly mentioned that it has no reference to the Pathans of Afghanisthan, but is a genuine Hindu word derived from Paithan. The district Gazetteer of Kangra 1924-25 also confirms the same. The capital of Pathania state was shifted from Pathankot to Nurpur then called Dhahmeri in the year 1595 A.D. by Raja Basu. The Pathania regime ruled the state from Pathankot for about five hundred long years and later on from Nurpur up to 1815 A.D. when the state of Nurpur was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1603 A.D. the Pargana Pathankot had been severed from Nurpur and permanently annexed by Emperor Akbar and was handed over to Mirza Rustam Qandhari which remained under Mughal control up to 1759 A.D. On the break up to Mughal empire one Ajaib Rai Puri who was posted as Kanugo at Pathankot has established himself as a king of Pathankot and Sujanpur. Mohalla Purian of Pathankot seems to have been inhabited by this clan. Ajaib Rai Kanugo was supplanted by Sardar Nand Singh Bhangi in 1761 A.D., who died in 1775 without a male child. His widow invited Tara Singh S/o Mutsada Singh of Fatehgarh Churian, Tehsil Batala of Kahnaya Misal to come & marry her daughter and succeed her husband and took the whole of Nand Singh's possession henceforth. Pathankot remained under the control of Kahnaya Misal till 1807 A.D. when Jaimal Singh had to yield his possession to Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The change of name from Paithan to Pathankot took place under the leadership of Sardar Gurbax Singh Kahnaya during the second half of the 19th century. Maharaja Rabjit Singh had 46 wife's Maharaja married a Mohamandan prostitute of Amritsar in 1802 A.D. with whom the fell in violent love. Moran enjoyed Ranjit Singh's confidence for many years and he had struck gold and silver coins in her name which were called Moran Shahi Sikkey. Suddenly in August 1811 A.D. Moran was sent to Pathankot in a Palkin which was granted to her as Jagir. It is believed that she spent last days of her life at Pathankot. After the defeat in the first Sikh- Anglo War, Pathankot along with 83 villages were attached with the newly created District of Kangra, by the British and remained as such till the formation of District Gurdaspur which commenced in 1852. In 1853 Pathankot Tehsil was formed with its headquarters at Pathankot. Pathankot got the Tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947. Whole of the Indian nations celebrated Independence on 15 August 1947, but district Gurdaspur including Pathankot remained part of Pakistan for three days under Lord Mountbetan's 3 June Plan. Tricolour of India was hoisted atop of the tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947. After Independence and the arrival of the refugees from Pakistan, new faces werte seen on the roads of Pathankot. The people have started to build their carrier a fresh in the new era. Pathankot has gone through a large number of changes and developments as well. It is called gateway of Himachal Pradesh and J & K states. Ranjit Sagar Dam the Pride of Punjab has been emerged about 30 km. north east of the town Nowadays Mamoon a suburb of Pathankot is heading towards a biggest army cantonment of Asia. Pthankot had already an Air Force Station and shall be coming on the air map of India very shortly. With the opening of civil aerodrome the hotel business of the town will be largely benefitted. Surprisingly enough, the town is totally devoid of any monumental evidence to speak of its rich past except a high ridge called Shimla Pahari where the historical fort once existed with some part of rouni around the Gulmohar Tourist Complex. A number of various buildings such as PWD Rest House. Gulmohar Tourist Complex, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Municipal Library. Lal Bahadur Shastri Park, Relay center of Doordarshan, and an office of central PWD are located at the site of the Fort. In present times, Pathankot is one of a vibrant places in Punjab with lot of hustle bustle making it one of the famous trade markets and that too a pretty busy one. From Pathankot it's pretty ease to travel up in the hills of Dalhousie and Dharmshala. Demographics Pathankot District has a population of 626,000 as of 2011. Most of the district's population is Hindu with sizeable Sikh, Christian and Muslim minorities. The district today In past, It was a Tehsil of the District Gurdaspur.

In April 2006, now lead vocalist, Aaron Watkins, replaced Kat Barnes. In August 2007, Random Hero entered the KBPI Best Band in Denver competition. KBPI is owned by Clear Channel, and is the fourth largest rock radio station in the United States. Hundreds of bands entered the contest. Random Hero finished the contest in the top three. In March 2008, drummer Rob Higdon left the band and the remaining members auditioned Josh Tarrant who joined the band. For the remainder of 2008, the band continued to play to large and growing crowds, not only headlining shows, but playing in direct support of national & International bands. In January 2009, Random Hero was approached by MTV as potential coaches for the MTV reality show \\"Made\\".

The completed Made episode aired more than fifty times in the US and an equal number over seas. For the remainder of 2009, Random Hero played a heavy schedule of shows and toured to AgapeFest, and Cornerstone in Illinois. The band also performed a spot on the Van's Warped Tour. The band following continued to grow rapidly, and they were asked to play at the Six Flags Elitch's \\"Faith Day\\" with Relient K. Random Hero's drummer Josh Tarrant is an active member of the United States Air Force. An opportunity was given to the band to write a song for the US Air Force's Guardian Challenge. Bertrand and Watkins wrote the song \\"Guardians of Freedom\\" with Josh Tarrant acting as producer. The song was chosen as the theme song for the Buckley Air Force Base entry into the Guardian Challenge.McNabb, Tech. Sgt. Scott (April 15, 2010) afspc.af.mil. Retrieved on July 28, 2011. What followed was a number of performances for thousands of US Air Force members, including some of the nations top Air Force Generals, officers, and the Assistant Undersecretary of the Air Force. In December 2009, Random Hero became one of the first bands in the United States to release an iPhone app. In 2010, Random Hero released the Black EP, and the White EP to rave reviews. The band traveled to Illinois to play an AgapeFest kickoff show. Two months later, Random Hero made their main stage debut in just their second year at AgapeFest. Random Hero was overwhelmed by fans after their performance, and immediately invited back to AgapeFest in 2011. During the remainder of the summer, Random Hero played Cornerstone. For the first time, the band performed at Hills Alive Festival in Rapid City, SD. In addition, the band was invited to perform at Colorado's largest Christian music festival Heaven Fest, and for the second time in as many years, the Elitch Gardens Theme Park's \\"Faith Day\\"‚Ä¶This time with Skillet. At the conclusion of Random Hero's set, both John Cooper and Ben Kasica of Skillet approached the band to inquire whether or not the band was signed to a label. Over the following months, Random Hero signed an exclusive production contract with Kasica. \\"It is a great honor that Ben has chosen to work with Random Hero,\\" said front man Aaron Watkins. Watkins went on to say, \\"not only is Ben highly respected for his producing talents, but all the members of Random Hero are huge fans of Skillet.\\" Pre-production on a number of songs started in September 2010. On November 1, 2010, the band began recording the new songs at Kasiaca's, Skies Fall Studios, in Kenosha, WI. In January 2011, Random Hero brought on a second guitarist, Alex Salinas in early February 2011, Salinas left the band not long after.

Program Director Willie B had this to say about the band \\"The whole EP is great, but the song Breakdown is absolutely amazing, and in my opinion is a huge hit. It could easily be playing on the radio in regular rotation right now. Bottom line, this band is fantastic, and if people would just listen to the song, they would get immediately hooked on the band.\\" In early 2012, Random Hero's drummer Josh Tarrant was accepted into the US Air Force's exclusive entertainment troupe \\"Tops in Blue\\". With Tarrant's forthcoming one-year absence, the band began to search for a new drummer. During their search, Andrew Whiteman (Red Tide Rising) filled in for live shows already scheduled. After a lengthy search, the band chose Jon Cornella as the new drummer. Jon was found playing in the worship band at a local mega church called Southeast Christian Church. Shortly after Tarrant's departure, long time bass player Derek Arosemena felt he was being called in a different direction that would render him unable to tour for any length of time. Derek was replaced within a few days by Rob \\"Los\\" McDonough. Though new to Random Hero as a musician, Los has been part of the Random Hero family from the very beginning of Aaron Watkins joining the band. He is not only the graphic design artist behind all of the band's images and logos, he is also Aaron's brother in law.

It was established in Russia in 2008. Activities of this betting company are aimed at developing betting business in Russia, supporting national sports, and creating new spheres of entertainment.  History  The history of ‚ÄúLiga Stavok‚Äù is closely connected with the name of its founder Oleg Zhuravsky, a significant Russian lobbyist of bookmaker business interests. Zhuravsky was born in 1969, served in the Western Group of Forces in the GDR from 1988-1990, and graduated from the Ugra State University in 1991. Later, in 2010, he also earned a degree from the St. Petersburg Institute of International Trade, Economics and Law. He took a great interest in the bookmaking business in Europe during the 1990s. Since 1997, Zhuravsky held leading positions in companies of the Russian gambling industry. In the mid-2000s, he founded the National Association of Russian Bookmakers and started lobbying the interests and development of this sphere. Under his leadership, the Association has united more than half of the largest actors in the Russian market. After Zhuravsky's death, the media emphasized his decisive role in the progress of the Russian betting industry. As a result of the activists‚Äô efforts, Russian bookmakers were exempted from the law ‚ÄúOn state regulations of activities on organizing and conducting gambling.‚Äù In 2008 Zhuravsky together with his friend and business partner Yuriy Krasovsky founded \\"First International bookmaker company\\" that start its activity under the \\"Liga Stavok\\" brand. From 2017 Yuriy Krasovsky is a President of Bookmaker Company \\"Liga Stavok\\" and First self-regulated bookmaker's organization of Russia.  Against match- fixing  Since 2010, the ‚ÄúLiga Stavok‚Äù began to cooperate with the Russian Premier League (RPL) to counteract football match fixing and corruption in sport. Oleg Zhuravsky was appointed adviser to the President of the Premier League on the prevention of match-fixing. His company started monitoring and controlling the pre-match betting markets on the RPL matches in order to detect collusion between participating teams. In 2013, Zhuravsky promoted the adoption of a law that increased the penalty for participation in match- fixing. Sports federations were obligated to take measures to combat match- fixing and to inform authorities about the unlawful effect of such competitions. For violation of these rules, state accreditation could be withdrawn. According to the law, bookmakers were required to accept bets only upon the presentation of identity documents, to keep records of gambling participants, as well as to inform the taxation organizations and sports federations of the payouts or payable winnings according to the results of wagers on matches which ended with the least probable outcome.  Interactive bets  Oleg Zhuravsky proposed amendments to federal law No. 244-–§–ó \\"On state regulation of activities for organizing and conducting gambling,‚Äù which came into effect in 2014. Legislative innovations obliged bookmakers and organizers of parimutuel betting to join self-regulatory organizations (SRO), and introduced the notions of \\"interactive bets\\" and \\"the –°enter for taking interactive bets\\" (Russian: ¬´–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä —É—á—ë—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º–∞ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ç–∞–≤–æ–∫¬ª, –¶–£–ü–ò–°) through which bookmakers could be legalized via the Internet. At the end of 2014, a number of large bookmakers, including the ‚ÄúLiga Stavok,‚Äù Winline, \\"1√óStavka\\" and 888.ru, united into the \\"First Self-Regulatory Organization\\" headed by Zhuravsky. Improvement of the legal framework for online bookmaking took another year, and in February 2016 the first ‚ÄúCenter‚Äù (–¶–£–ü–ò–°) was launched by the ‚ÄúFirst SRO‚Äù on the platform of the non-banking credit organization ‚ÄúMobil‚Äônaya karta‚Äù. The \\"Liga Stavok\\" was the first Russian bookmaker company, which was integrated with the ‚ÄúFirst –°enter for Taking Interactive Bets‚Äù and began to receive bets online. To make an interactive bet, customers had to go online to register at the ‚ÄúLiga Stavok‚Äù website, then on the ‚ÄúCenter‚Äôs‚Äù website, and, finally, confirm their identity by visiting the bookmaker's club or an office of its partner. In November 2016, the ‚ÄúLiga Stavok‚Äù was awarded the Runet Prize as the best online service offering sports entertainment.  Cooperation with sports associations  On April 1, 2017, the federal law \\"On Introducing Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in Formation of Mechanisms for Increasing the Income of the Subjects of Children's and Youth Sports as well as the Subjects of Professional Sports\\" was enacted. This legalization expanded the ways in which the bookmaker business might be advertised, but at the same time affirmed that bookmakers should give part of their profits to sports associations that control matches. The target deductions of bookmakers were 5% of the positive difference between the number of accepted bets and paid wins. Of these deductions, 20% were to be spent on the development of children's and youth sports, and another 80% - for professional sports. The ‚ÄúLiga Stavok,‚Äù led by Oleg Zhuravsky, was one of the main public supporters of the adoption of this law and actively participated in its elaboration. When the law was implemented, agreements were signed with the following sports associations: * Russian Biathlon Union (April 2017); * Russian Basketball Federation (April 2017); * VTB United League (April 2017); * All-Russian Volleyball Federation (April 2017); * Handball Federation of Russia (May 2017); * Russian Chess Federation (May 2017); * National Federation of Badminton Russia (June 2017); * The Union of Mixed Martial Arts of Russia (June 2017); * Russian Bandy Federation (June 2017); * Russian Tennis Federation (June 2017); * Russian Football Union (June 2017); * Russian Table Tennis Federation (July 2017); * Ice Hockey Federation of Russia (July 2017); * Kontinental Hockey League (July 2017); * Rugby Federation of Russia (September 2017); * Curling Federation of Russia (October 2017); * Boxing Federation of Russia.  Long-term partnership  Since 2010, Liga Stavok has been cooperating with the Russian Premier League in the framework of the Pan-European Early Warning System, aimed at fighting match fixing. In September 2012, together with the head of the Russian Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin, the company announced the creation of the All-Russian Football Lottery, 10% of the proceeds of which was supposed to be sent to the RFPL for the development of youth football and mass football in the Russian Federation. The projected revenue, according to the parties, should have been at least 1.6 billion rubles in five years. In 2014, Liga Stavok became the official betting company of the Russian Premier League, with which it currently works as the general partner of the Russian Premier League. In July 2017, according to the results of a closed tender, Liga Stavok became the general partner of the Russian Football Championship. This status provided the company with advertising time on television broadcasts of the Premier League matches (Match TV, Our Football, Match! Football 1, Match! Arena and others), as well as advertising on stadiums and billboards around the field. In 2017, the President of Liga Stavok, Yuri Krasovsky, and the head of the Russian Premier League, Sergey Pryadkin, announced the establishment of a new sports prize, League Fair Play. The purpose of the award is to encourage Russian teams showing respect for the rules and conditions of the game, demonstrating friendly behavior towards the opponent, referees, fans and the media. UEFA recommends a methodology for assessing the behavior of teams for professional football leagues, and the analysis of matches using the Fair Play system is carried out by the match delegate. In the same year, the Russian Hockey Federation and BC Liga Stavok agreed on a long-term partnership by signing a five-year sponsorship agreement. The signing ceremony, which took place on the eve of the First Channel Cup, was attended by FHR First Vice- President Roman Rotenberg and President of Liga Stavok Yury Krasovsky. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that we have a new partner, we have been negotiating for a long time. This will help us develop all nine national teams, the future of our hockey depends on the volume of investments \\", - commented the contract Roman Rotenberg. \\"Liga Stavok\\" is the official partner of the Russian national hockey team.

The other original members besides Westman, were Kent Sj√∂holm on drums, Anders Nordstrand on bass, and Danish-Swede Nils Lund-Larsen on guitar. Gunnar Frick who played keyboard joined later in the year. Psychotic Youth began as a garage rock band, influenced among others by Solna band The Nomads and the Malm√∂ band Wilmer X. They later on incorporated various styles such as rockabilly, surf punk, metal, psychedelia and new wave / power-pop into their music. Psychotic Youth released an initial flexi disc for J√∂rgen's fanzine Straight from the Grooveyard and two full-length CDs, Faster! Faster! and Anything For A Thrill with limited local success. The band moved to Gothenburg in 1988, as a four band piece that included J√∂rgen Westman, Gunnar Frick, Kent Sj√∂holm and new recruit guitarist Magnus \\"Rosehip\\" Nyberg. For a very short time bass player Erik Danielsson joined in before quitting. After his departure, Gunnar, originally a keyboard player, became the bassist for the band. The band released their third full-length album Some Fun in 1989 produced by Chips Kiesbye from Sator. Kiesbye also convinced Radium 226.05 record label to sign the band. The album became a breakthrough record for the band. The single \\"Julie\\" brought in further attention to the band's music. It was followed in 1991 by another single \\"It Won't Be Long Before We See The Sun Shine\\". The band also toured substantially and performed at many music festivals finding acclaim in Sweden and to some extent internationally after gigs in Denmark, Norway, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In 1992, the band released their fourth album ..Be in the Sun.. produced by P√§r Edwardsson. In 1993, Magnus \\"Rosehip\\" Nyberg left to form the hardcore band Mary Beats Jane. He was replaced by guitarist Ulf Abrahamsson. The band released their fifth album Juice! produced by Chips Kiesbye resulting in two singles \\"Elevator Girl\\" and \\"MTV\\". 1994 saw the release of the 8-song Pop EP with notably a cover of Aneka's \\"Japanese Boy\\" hitting the airwaves in Sweden. In 1994, J√∂rgen Westman, established his own label Blast Records and released the full-length album Bamboozle! with a lot of materials from both Juice and Pop. The German label Wolverine Records greatly interested in Bamboozle! offered wide distribution throughout Europe. Soon after, long-time band members Kent and Gunnar left in 1995 after the German tour and were replaced by Dennis Staaf on drums and Johannes Kagelind on bass. The band was signed to MNW Records who put up a compilation album of Psychotic Youth hits in Small Wonders 1985-1996, followed by the rerelease of Faster! Faster and Anything For A Thrill in a joint release. Johannes Kagelind soon left to the United States and was replaced by veteran bassist Crippa Elvis Odin. The band's final album before their break-up, Stereoids was produced by Rune Johansson and released in 1998. The band also had two joint projects, one with Surf Trio in Splitsville in 1996 and with the Richies in Bubblepunk in 1997. After the band disbanded in 1999, founder J√∂rgen Westman formed the rockabilly band The Buckshots. In December 2005, there was a 20th anniversary reunion concert in Gothenburg and in May 2010, a 25th anniversary reunion gig in Kramfors' Folkets Park with the original members of 1985. In 2015, Psychotic Youth reunited with partly new members by request of US artist Kurt Baker and Norwegian Morten Henriksen (The Yum Yums) to accompany them on their Scandinavian tour in April 2015. At the same time Jorgen was contacted by the Japanese label Waterslide Records who wanted to release a 30th anniversary compilation, followed by a Japan tour in February 2016. Overwhelmed by the response, the band recorded a new studio album titled The Voice of Summer which was released by the Japanese labels Waterslide/Target Earth Records in January 2017. This was followed by a number of shows and tours in Europe and added members to go alongside existing members depending on availability. The original bass player Anders Nordstrand and original drummer Kent Sj√∂holm are back in the band. Their latest studio album 21 was released on 25 January 2019 through Target Earth and Waterslide Records, respectively. On 30 October 2020, the band will release a new studio album entitled Forever and Never through the Waterslide label. A new joint EP (vinyl only) is to be released in autumn including the unreleased track \\"Silly Song\\". The story continues...

It strives to promote quality of communication research and teaching in higher education across Europe. It counts more than 2700 individuals as members. At present, ECREA's legal seat is located in Brussels, Belgium. ECREA is similar in nature with other learned societies like the International Communication Association (ICA) and the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR).  Governance  The General Assembly is the governing body of ECREA that exercises the ultimate authority over the implementation of the association's decisions. The General Assembly is composed of all active institutional and individual members. With simple majority every four years the General Assembly elects the Executive Board which, in turn, appoints from its members (at least 3 and maximum 15) the President, the Vice President, the General-Secretary, the Treasurer and (potentially) the Secretary of the Bureau. Together they form the Bureau, which decides on day-to-day management and organisational matters and acts on behalf of the associations in legal cases. In addition, the Forum of Section, Temporary Working Groups and Networks, and the Advisory Board that can be consulted by the Executive Board and the Bureau.  Conferences and Doctoral Summer School  Every other year, ECREA organizes and sponsors a large-scale international conference, dubbed the |European Communication Conference (ECC). Each conference features keynote speeches, alongside parallel sessions organised by the Sections as well as panel discussions revolving around pre- set topics. The venue of the conference is usually a big European city. These are the conference locations and dates; * first ECC: Amsterdam (24‚Äì26 November 2005), * second ECC: Barcelona (25‚Äì28 November 2008),http://www.innovations- report.de/html/berichte/veranstaltungen/ecrea_barcelona_2008_123334.html * third ECC Hamburg (12‚Äì15 October 2010) * fourth ECC: Istanbul (24‚Äì27 October 2012), * fifth ECC: Lisbon (12‚Äì15 November 2014). * sixth ECC: Prague (9‚Äì12 November 2016).http://www.ecrea2016prague.eu In the uneven years, ECREA's Sections, Temporary Working Groups and Networks each organize a smaller event. Every year, a Doctoral Summer School is organised, during which leading experts and junior scholars discuss the PhD projects of the participating junior scholars. These so-called student feedback workshops are combined with lectures, presentations, workshops and seminars. The ECREA Doctoral Summer School represents a supportive environment for up-and-coming European researchers which, it is thought, boosts their early career development. The Doctoral Summer School has a long history, even before ECREA became involved, and was organised in the following locations: * Grenoble, France (1992‚Äì1996) * Madrid, Spain (1997) * Lund, Sweden (1998) * London, UK (1999‚Äì2003) * Helsinki, Finland (2004) * Tartu, Estonia (2005‚Äì2009) * Ljubljana, Slovenia (2010‚Äì2012) * Bremen, Germany (2013‚Äì2015) * Milan, Italy (2016 ‚Äì onwards)  Book series  ECREA manages two book series. The \\"ECREA Book Series\\" was published by Intellect until 2012.The Book Series' description stresses the academic position and its openness: \\"The ECREA series makes a major contribution to the theory, research, practice and/or policy literature in the field of Communication and Media Studies. The ECREA series is European in scope and represents a diversity of paradigms, perspectives, and cultures. Each book is edited by one or more acknowledged authorities in the field and the contributors have been selected to provide a broad overview and breadth of understanding of the concerns in question. Book proposals are refereed. Although the ECREA series is clearly embedded in the ECREA membership, a degree of openness towards non- ECREA members is considered to add value to the series. \\" See http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/books/view-Series,id=7/ A new book series, the \\"Routledge Studies in European Communication Research and Education\\" was started in 2013.See http://www.routledge.com/books/series/ECREA/ Since July 2013, six edited collections have been published in this series, and three more titles will be published later in 2015. Current series editors are Claudia Alvares (Lus√≥fona University), Ilija Tomaniƒá Trivund≈æa (University of Ljubljana) and Fausto Colombo (Catholic University, Milan). All books published in both series feature original work by ECREA members.

As of 2016, there are about 16,145 Japanese residents in Vietnam, mostly around Hanoi. History Early history Ch√πa C·∫ßu, a Japanese-built covered bridge in H·ªôi An. For a brief period in the 16th to the 17th centuries, Japanese overseas activity and presence in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the region boomed. Sizeable Japanese communities, known as Nihonmachi, could be found in many of the major ports and political centers of the region, where they exerted significant political and economic influence.Wray. p8. One of which was H·ªôi An in Nguy·ªÖn, Southern Vietnam.Woodside. p162. The Japanese community there was quite small, consisting of only a few tens of households.A 1642 report to the Dutch East India Company by a Japanese inhabitant of the port describes a Chinese population of 4,000-5,000 and a Japanese population of 40-50. (Laarhoven, Ruurdje (trans.) \\"A Japanese Resident's Account: Declaration of the Situation of Quinam Kingdom by Francisco, 1642.\\" in Li and Reid (eds.) Southern Vietnam. p31.) Over the course of the 17th century, the Japanese community in H·ªôi An gradually shrank and disappeared, assimilated into the Vietnamese community. Intermarriage not only within the Nihonmachi, but between notable Japanese merchant families and the Nguy·ªÖn noble family, is indicated by contemporary records, grave markers, and various forms of anecdotal evidence. The descendants of several of these merchant families still hold today as heirlooms objects relating the families' connections to Vietnam.Chuong, Thau. \\"Bridge of Friendship.\\" in Ancient Town of Hoi An. p209. Modern era During World War II, on September 22, 1940, Japan invaded Vietnam and began constructing military bases to strike against the Allies in Southeast Asia. Japanese troops remained in Vietnam until their surrender to the Allies in 1945. Some Japanese troops from the IJA stayed in Vietnam and were recruited into the ranks of the Viet Minh as NCO's and Officers were needed to train the Viet Minh in modern tactics. Some also simply assimilated, intermarried with the Vietnamese population and adopted Vietnamese names. In recent years, many natives of Japan have migrated to Vietnam, mostly to Hanoi for all sorts of reasons. According to the Japan Foundation, Hanoi is home to under 5,000 Japanese residents.wordhcmc.com - Little Japan Chief among the professional lures are construction management, manufacturing and financial services jobs. Japan-owned Toyota, Honda, Panasonic, Yamaha and Canon have large manufacturing plants on the outskirts of Hanoi. Outside of business, Japanese foreign aid services and management are also a draw.

It is found in the sugar-binding antiviral protein cyanovirin-N (CVN) as well as proteins from filamentous ascomycetes and in the fern Ceratopteris richardii. Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is an 11-kDa protein from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum that displays virucidal activity against several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (AIDS). The virucidal activity of CV-N is mediated through specific high-affinity interactions with the viral surface envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, as well as to high- mannose oligosaccharides found on the HIV envelope. In addition, CV-N is active against rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enteric viruses. The virucidal activity of CV-N against influenza virus is directed towards viral haemagglutinin. CV-N has a complex fold composed of a duplication of a tandem repeat of two homologous motifs comprising three-stranded beta sheet and beta hairpins.

Garnaut is also a founder of the Shanghai International Literary Festival BloombergLink.com: Michelle Garnaut, the M Literary Residency, the Village People Project and has spearheaded Mentor Walks in both Beijing and Shanghai. In 2018, Michelle Garnaut was awarded an Order of Australia (AO) for her work. Career After dropping out of Monash University, Garnaut travelled around the world, spending time in Europe, including Greece and England, as well as the United States of America. She then returned to Australia to study catering at the William Angliss Institute of TAFE. The Age: Michelle Garnaut interview She then went to London, where she worked at Leiths School of Food and Wine as one of the head chefs on the Orient Express. Following this, she arrived in Hong Kong in 1984. Though she only intended a short stay in Hong Kong, she soon began cooking at Restaurant 97 in Hong Kong's Lan Kwai Fong, after which she launched her own catering business. HK: Michelle Garnaut Over a period of 20 years, she then launched three restaurants and a bar in Greater China: M at the Fringe in Hong Kong (1989‚Äì2009), M on the Bund in Shanghai (opened 1999), Glamour Bar in Shanghai (2006‚Äì2014), Glam in Shanghai (opened in 2015) and Capital M in Beijing (2009-2017). M at the Fringe Garnaut originally wanted to open a restaurant in Hong Kong with her former co-worker at the Restaurant 97 Group, fellow Australian Greg Malouf. However, Malouf fell ill and had to return to Australia. Mietta's: Greg Malouf During her time at Restaurant 97, Garnaut became acquainted with business contacts, local celebrities and bankers who became investors in her new restaurant. TIME: \\"The M in Stamina\\" In 1989, Garnaut opened her first restaurant, M at the Fringe, in The Hong Kong Fringe Club's building. Her inspiration behind M at the Fringe was to fill a niche in Hong Kong for modern international restaurants. In an interview with Time Magazine, Garnaut remarked, \\"When I first arrived in Asia, I was in Hong Kong and got into a lift to go up to a restaurant on the seventh floor, where we were greeted by 20 Chinese guys saying 'Ciao' and singing 'O Sole Mio.' I thought, 'This is crazy.' A restaurant has to have some soul. The whole make-believe world has to have some basis in reality.\\" M at the Fringe was successful in attracting a loyal and famous clientele, including guests like Pierce Brosnan and Kate Moss. At the time, Hong Kong dining was mostly based on Cantonese cuisine, but M at the Fringe was considered a pioneer in European fine dining. Luxury Insider:\\"Hong Kong's M at the Fringe Bids Farewell to The Fringe\\" Twenty years later, the building was forced to undergo extensive renovations to meet government standards forcing Garnaut to relocate M at the Fringe to a different location. That same year, it won HK Magazine's \\"Best Restaurant\\" award. Currently, M at the Fringe is still searching for a new location. M on the Bund In 1999, Garnaut expanded the M Restaurant Group to Shanghai by opening M on the Bund on the historic waterfront. Shanghai Eats: M on the Bund After testing the market as a guest chef cooking western food at the famous Peace Hotel on the Bund, Garnaut decided to establish a restaurant overlooking the Bund, the Huangpu River and Pudong. The Australian: Chinese Cracker Garnaut opened M on the Bund during a time when the Bund was not nearly the attraction that it is today. Devoid of upscale restaurants, luxury stores, cafes, and bars of the present day, Garnaut's choice of location on the Bund was surprising, and in retrospect, pioneering. As Garnaut said in a 2004 interview with The Wall Street Journal, \\"People said I was crazy. The Bund was dark and dingy. This was a real risk.\\" Ron Gluckman interview with Michelle Garnaut Though critics predicted the failure of the venture, and M on the Bund was the sole upscale independent western restaurant on the Bund for a full five years, it quickly became a landmark, and eventually other restaurants, bars and luxury venues followed. Like M at the Fringe, M on the Bund found popularity with the social elite including celebrities like Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, supermodel Tyra Banks, the Ferragamo family, the United Kingdom's Prince Edward, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, the queen of Thailand and the prince of the Netherlands. CNNGo.com: Where the Celebrities Eat in Shanghai M on the Bund also found success with a variety of awards from the Miele Guide, Zagat, and Conde Nast. Your Ultimate Guide to Beijing: M on the Bund The Glamour Bar & M Glam In 2006, Garnaut established The Glamour Bar on the floor below M on the Bund in the former Nissin Shipping Building. The bar served as a lounge as well as a venue for M Group literary events Shanghailander: Glamour Bar until its closing in 2014 In 2015, M Glam opened on the same floor as M on the Bund. Glam is a bar, restaurant and lounge and serves as the venue for the restaurant's cultural events, including the Shanghai International Literary Festival, chamber music, film screenings, and talks. Capital M Capital M was established in 2009 in Beijing, overlooking the north end of Tiananmen. CNNGo.com: Capital M opens in China's (northern) capital Garnaut spent more than seven years negotiating with officials and bidding on the Qianmen location. Garnaut pushed to have the restaurant open before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but the construction of Qianmen was delayed, pushing the restaurant opening back. Even after opening, Capital M faced another challenge as it was forced to shut down for one week during the celebration for the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Garnaut said in an interview with The Australian, \\"You have to roll with the punches in China. If you lose your temper, they just don't care. That's how it is.\\" After overcoming the obstacles, Capital M, like its predecessors, went on to win year-end awards including multiple wins in The Beijinger's Reader Restaurant Awards in 2011. The Beijinger: 8th Annual Reader Restaurant Awards Capital M closed in September 2017. Shanghai International Literary Festival In 2002, Garnaut founded the Shanghai International Literary Festival. The 2‚Äìweek-long festival takes place at Glam. The festival has continued to draw well-known authors including Gore Vidal, Amy Tan, and Thomas Keneally. Philanthropy Garnaut's primary philanthropic work currently focuses on the Village People Project, which creates community bathhouses to improve the welfare of rural Chinese women. TEDxBeijing, Theme: Double Lives In Beijing, she is an organizer of MentorWalks, a mentoring program for young women starting out in their careers. Previously, she has served as the director of Care for Children's Hong Kong branch which provides family care to orphans and children with disabilities.

She immigrated to Israel from Hungary after World War II, and founded the Gottex company. Biography Lea Lenke Roth (later Gottlieb) was born in Saj√≥szentp√©ter, Hungary. Before World War II began, she was planning to study chemistry. During Germany's occupation of Hungary in the mid-1940s, her husband Armin was shipped to a labor camp. Gottlieb‚Äîwho was Jewish‚Äîhid from the Nazis in Saj√≥szentp√©ter and Budapest, moving from one hiding place to another with her daughters Miriam and Judith. At checkpoints, she hid her head in a bouquet of flowers to avoid being recognized as a Jew. Once, after seeing a Nazi with a pistol, she concealed herself and her children in a pit behind a house. Gottlieb died at her home in Tel Aviv on November 12, 2012 at the age of 94. Fashion career Gottex swimsuits, 1961 Lea Gottlieb with models Gottlieb and her family survived the war, and after the liberation, she and her husband ran a raincoat factory in Czechoslovakia. They immigrated to Haifa, Israel in 1949. She recalled: \\"We came with nothing, without money, with nowhere to live. The first two or three years were very, very hard.\\" With money borrowed from family and friends, she and her husband opened a similar raincoat factory near Tel Aviv in 1949. But for months, they \\"saw no rain, only sunshine.\\" As a result, in 1956 they founded Gottex, a high-fashion beachwear and swimwear company that became a leading exporter, shipping to 80 countries. The company's name is a combination of \\"Gottlieb\\" and \\"textiles\\". Gottlieb, a seamstress, began by selling her wedding ring to raise money to buy fabric. She borrowed a sewing machine, and sewed swimsuits in their Jaffa apartment. She was the company's chief designer. As the company expanded, Gottlieb created beach outfits by complementing swimsuits with matching tops, pareos, caftans, tunics, loose pants, small corsets and skirts. Her collections often had dramatic and varied patterns that were inspired by and dominated by flowers, which she felt had saved her life during the Nazi occupation. In 1973, when the Yom Kippur War broke out, Gottlieb canceled a foreign tour, took over operations at Gottex, and arranged fashion shows for front-line soldiers. By 1984, Gottex had sales of $40 million ($ in current dollar terms), and was the leading exporter of fashion swimwear to the United States, and had two-thirds of the Israeli swimwear market. Among those who wore the company's bathing suits were Diana, Princess of Wales, Spain's Queen Sofia, Elizabeth Taylor, Brooke Shields and Nancy Kissinger. In 1991, almost half of the company's $60 million business was in the United States. Lev Leviev, the owner of the Africa-Israel Group, acquired Gottex in 1997. After about a year heading the design team, Gottlieb left the company. Once her non- compete agreement with Gottex expired, at the age of 85 she founded a new swimwear design company, under her own name.

These course offer slightly different pathways but all aim at providing the training and qualifications required to succeed and find a career in the watersports industry. Yachting The first yachting course taught at UKSA was Professional Crew Training developed by Noel Lister and his team. This developed into Professional Crew and Skipper training and then in 1998 into Caribbean Ocean Training. By 2001 the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) introduced new superyacht regulations so yachting career courses were moved in line with this. Superyachting & MCA Training In 2001 the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) introduced new superyacht regulations so yachting career courses were moved in line with this. By 2003 engineering courses were offered as an alternative career option. Hospitality courses also began in 2003. UKSA added MCA Deck Officer training to its spectrum of courses in 2000. This began with Class 4 training but today includes STCW Basic Training, Master 200gt through to Officer of the Watch, Chief Mate and Master 3000gt. In 2004, UKSA worked in partnership with the MCA to develop its five-phase Superyacht Cadetship which trains individuals to Deck Officer level through training at UKSA and paid work placements in the Superyacht industry. In 2008, The Corporation of Trinity House extended its Professional Yachtsman Bursary Scheme to individuals applying for the UKSA Cadetship.\\"The Professional Yachtsman Bursary Scheme\\", Royal Institute of Navigation, 2010 The scheme funds part of the Cadet's tuition fees along with a maintenance grant.

Schools and Groups Schools and youth groups from across the UK visit UKSA for day or residential trips throughout the year. UKSA offer groups to tailor make their trips to meet the needs and demands set out by the groups. Trips focus providing children and adults alike from all backgrounds with new water related experiences, with many gaining basic qualifications whilst taking part in these programs. In 2019 8000+ individuals from schools and youth groups spent time at UKSA.  Leisure Courses  UKSA offers a wide range of paid maritime leisure courses ranging from dingy sailing and powerboating to the full RYA Yachtmaster syllabus. UKSA accepted over 953 leisure course students in 2019 with an age range of 6-77. Disability UKSA works with a number of specialist schools, groups and individuals to assist them in being able to participate in watersports and sailing activities. In 2010 278 beneficiaries with disabilities spent time at UKSA on day or residential trips. Sporting performance UKSA provides the opportunity for young people to sail competitively. GBR Yacht Racing Academy (GBR YRA) The GBR YRA was created in 2006 by Bear of Britain owner Kit Hobday and Chernikeeff 2 owner Peter Harrison in association with UKSA.Cowes Online British Keelboat Academy In 2009 GBR YRA joined forces with the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) to form the British Keelboat Academy (BKA). The BKA is aimed at 18- to 24-year-old with the squad divided in ‚ÄòDevelopment‚Äô and ‚ÄòNational‚Äô. The Development squad train and race on UKSA's fleet of J80s.

Following a campaign to restore her, the boat was ready to sail again in 2005. From 2005-07, Gipsy Moth IV completed a second circumnavigation. Instead of breaking records like Sir Francis Chichester, this global voyage had disadvantaged young people on board as part of the crew.BBC Devon In November 2010, Gipsy Moth IV was bought by new owners Rob Thompson and Eileen Skinner. The boat is managed by UKSA and alongside attending events throughout the year, will be used by UKSA to promote their charitable activities.BBC News Apprenticeship Using funding from the government's Future Jobs Fund, two cohorts of 18- to 24-year- olds that had been labelled as NEET ‚Äì not in employment, education or training ‚Äì began training for watersports qualifications at UKSA in April and October 2010. The training was designed to give each young person a host of transferable skills to utilise in the future. Island Youth Partnership In partnership with the Isle of Wight Community Partnership, the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary, Vestas Technology UK and Employee Volunteering, UKSA launched a pilot project for young people on the Isle of Wight in spring and summer of 2010. The young people on the project took part in structured sailing and watersports activities alongside personal mentoring to help them develop essential skill sets and confidence to help them engage with local clubs and services. This has evolved into a range of youth development programmes which all involve on-the-water activities as the catalyst for positive change, giving young people the chance to get their lives back on track. People arrive at UKSA from all walks of life, but for NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training), young offenders, or those who are failing to engage at school, being immersed in the positive environment of UKSA can be life-changing. Generally the courses involve a team-building residential, watersports and sailing, community work, work experience and help to complete a professional CV.

After completing his education he went straight into a six-year signing with the Army, where his entrepreneurial spirit was already apparent on a troop ship to Egypt towards the end of WWII when he traded cigarettes and did a ‚Äútea round‚Äù selling tea to other soldiers too lazy to make their own in the heat. Back on home soil, he entered the world of retail by working in a furniture store. He was such a strong character the shop owner said he would either end up in prison or turn up one day in a Rolls Royce. Noel knew which path to take, left the business, and four years later, sure enough, he pulled up in his Roller. He built up his own furniture business, popularising the concept of a dining room suite by selling tables with matching chairs, and introducing bunk beds to the family home (things that hadn't been widely done before). This entrepreneurial spirit and constant re-evaluation of what works best led him to a fortune when his empire grew and he set up furniture giant MFI ‚Äî launching the concept of shed retailing and out-of-town shopping while essentially inventing the concept of flat pack self-assembly furniture (even hiring out roof racks so customers had no excuse not to buy that very day!) Noel was a bold adventurer and pretty fearless. He campaigned his racing yachts over many years during the time he ran MFI and accumulated a large amount of silverware against top national and international competition in RORC races, Fastnet etc. After an exhilarating and life-changing career as a retail genius he sold MFI for an extraordinary sum of money at the age of 58 and further indulged his passion for sailing, spending a good decade or so sailing around the world with his wife Sylvia on their beloved 103 ft boat, Whirlwind XII. He was not at all interested in Mediterranean glamour - his favourite destination was Alaska where he could enjoy being chased by grizzlies. While sailing the world he had time to reflect on his wonderful life ‚Äî and he knew he wanted to give something back. Sylvia explained: ‚ÄúHe would say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have all this money and not let children enjoy the sea as much as we do.‚Äù He knew he wanted to find a way of giving children confidence, and he felt a great way to do this would be to give them the opportunity to get out onto the water. His whole aim was to give disabled or disadvantaged children the chance to go sailing, and this idea just seemed to grow.‚Äù Mike Koppstein was Noel‚Äôs yacht captain, so he was with the businessman right at the beginning of UKSA, when the idea of establishing a sailing charity first came about. Mike explained: ‚ÄúNoel always had the idea of making sailing accessible to under-privileged children. It came through his experience of the teamwork of sailing and he felt strongly that it was something everyone should be able to experience. ‚ÄúNoel was quite a shy unassuming person, and sailing made him feel comfortable. He understood his own limitations in his shyness and saw how the sailing environment made him more sociable. It bought the gamesmanship and confidence out of him. ‚ÄúIn founding UKSA, the priority for him was to make an initial charitable donation but then for it to be run as a business. He was always very creative in making a pound go further while cleverly creating some income ‚Äì so it was not just about giving money, but about making UKSA run proficiently.‚Äù Noel had raced in Cowes for years and when the opportunity arose to buy a waterfront centre from the Sports Council in October 1987 he knew it would be perfect. He invested ¬£4 million in the Lister Charitable Trust to start the place afresh, and he applied his entrepreneurial principles to setting up the charity. In the early days there were 60 beds, and plenty of dinghies but no yachts, but it was busy with 1,500 children a year taking part in activities. The initial goal was to increase this operation by buying more kit to enable more schools to come along. With the growth in leisure holidays too, it became apparent that there were job opportunities for young people within the watersports industry, so UKSA looked into providing instructor training courses. The courses extended the operational arm of the charity, brought in income and helped young people set off on careers. It also kept the centre busy all year round, instead of closing for winter like it did in the early days. Later, the yacht training courses were established in response to a gap in the market and a need, all around the world, for experienced crew for the growing superyacht industry. Mike explained: ‚ÄúI came up with the idea of setting up crew training, because as far as we knew there was nothing else offering that. To the best of our knowledge we were very much the first. Before that, there were purely academic captains‚Äô courses, nothing blending the theory with the practical. If there were others, they were not formalised as ours was. The curriculum was wisely shaped in detail by Ben Cussons and attendance subsequently grew - and the rest is modern history.‚Äù Over the years, UKSA expanded by buying yachts, purchasing the hotel over the road (now Victory) to accommodate career students, building a swimming pool in 1993 and opening the Lister House accommodation block in 2003. Princess Royal became patron in 1992 ‚Äî the Royal seal of approval. Of great importance over recent years has been the transition from being a provider of maritime activities and training to one with a much more sophisticated focus on personal development as the context for these activities. Recognising individuals‚Äô needs, challenges and potential, and supporting them through mentoring into career paths and social worth, is what it is all about. Now, as a globally recognised youth education and maritime training charity, UKSA helps more people than ever before. Sylvia said: ‚ÄúThe whole thing makes us both very proud. I think it is brilliant as it gives children a chance in life. UKSA was Noel‚Äôs No.1 passion, definitely.‚Äù Noel was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Superyacht Awards in 2010 ‚Äì the first time a still-living yachtsman has been chosen. It was absolutely typical of Noel that, being a modest man, he couldn't see what all the fuss was about and refused to go to the ceremony. Sylvia and the family did, and collected a handsome award on his behalf. UKSA's founder Noel Lister died in 2015.

Background and early career Cao Peng was born into one of the most influential families in the once thriving trading centre of Jiangyin, related both to Cao Yuyuan, the famous court censor of the late Qing, and more distantly to the great Cao family (of which the most famous scion was Cao Xueqin) that had risen in the world from the 18th century. Though the Chinese economy flirted with depression in his early years, and no region remain unaffected by the Guomindang-CCP conflicts, and later the war against Japan, Cao was able to enjoy a happy upbringing and a solid education in his hometown. Cao Peng showed early promise as a musician, winning first place at his local high school. He is an alumnus of the Nanjing () Middle School in Jiangyin, set up by the reformer Huang Tifang in the 1880s.http://www.njschool.cn/ Cao Peng stayed in the institution until 1945, working for the final three years as an underground member of the Chinese Communist Party, into which role he was first employed by a violinist friend. It was not until June, 1945 that Cao went open about his involvement with the party, enrolling in the Cultural Work Division of the New Fourth Army. Following the Communist victory of 1949, he was enrolled at the Huazhong Construction University, before later moving to the arts faculty of Shandong University to study conducting.http://baike.baidu.com/view/292429.htm Upon graduation, Cao conducted the music for over ten early Communist films, including an adaptation into film of Lao She's Longxu Gulley. It was not until 1955, however, that what he would later describe as a turning point in his career would occur, when Cao Peng won a scholarship to study at the Gnessin State Musical College. He would study here for five and a half eventful years.http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/al0NTtxkcac/, Moscow and the Mao years During his stay in Moscow, Cao Peng attended conducting masterclasses given by Leo Ginzburg, and began conducting the resident orchestra on regular occasions. In 1960, he gave the maiden overseas performance of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto, as part of the celebrations for the 10th anniversary of the establishment of government by the Communist party. In August, 1961, Cao returned to China, where he was appointed permanent conductor in residence for the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. He has remained based in Shanghai for the past fifty years, taking on a number of new positions and professorships as the city continued to open up beyond the Mao years. The years before 1976 were not entirely inactive for Cao, however. In many respects, the classical music scene in Shanghai should remembered for its liveliness in the late Mao years, with pioneer conductors including Huang Yijun, Chen Chuanxi and Wang Yongji coming to the peaks of their respective careers. In 1962, Cao Peng collaborated with the Shanghai Opera House to give a performance of Puccini's Madama Butterfly, followed by later collaborations for performances of Manuel Da Falla's The Three-Cornered Hat and Delibes' Copp√©lia. In the shifting Shanghai of 1975, Cao was able to take his orchestra on an international tour, visiting and performing in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Professorships and charitable work, 1980s to present A number of professorships were made available to Cao during the 1980s, including an appointment as professor in residence at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. At the same time as he was beginning the turn to teaching, and passing along the invaluable experiences of Moscow and beyond to the younger generation, so was he increasingly involved in a classical music scene in transition. Cao gave a countless number of performances in the 1980s, which took him not only further abroad, but to places unvisited within China, where he was able to cultivate and promote people's awareness of classical music. In 1986, a year when he was recognised by his adopted city Shanghai for his achievements with the city award for \\"Achievements in the Culture and Arts\\", Cao also accepted an invitation to conduct over 30 performances of classical music in southern China's Fujian province. Similar success followed in the 1990s, when Cao, now in his sixties, took on responsibilities for the burgeoning orchestral music scene in Shanghai, conducting the Shanghai People's Orchestra () from 1992, later also the orchestra of the Nanyang Middle School. In 1993, at the age of 68, Cao was employed by the Hong Kong record label HNH to record a 50-CD anthology of modern Chinese classical music. Cao was also an early pioneer in the relaxing of tensions and building of cross-straits ties in the 1990s, heading the first classical music delegation to perform in Kaohsiung and other places throughout Taiwan in 1995, where he, incidentally, conducted publicly for the first time his daughter, the violinist Xia Xiaocao (). Though he no longer keeps a schedule as demanding as that he kept in the 1990s, Cao has remained involved in a number of orchestras into the new millennium. He still regularly takes delegations abroad to perform, notably in France and Japan, and has set up two other, pathbreaking orchestras under the Cao Peng Music Center, established in 2005 - the Shanghai Student Orchestra and the Sound of Angel Salon, the latter of which trains autistic children to engage with their surroundings through music.http://www.shcpmc.com.cn/profile/conductor.htm He has also continued to conduct film scores, totalling over 100 over the course of his career. Awards Cao has received many awards for his services to classical music and education inside China, including: ‚ÄúPrize for Outstanding Contribution to Musical Performance‚Äù, awarded by the State Council. ‚ÄúPrize for Pioneer Work Done in the Service of Chinese Culture‚Äù, awarded by the Central Affairs Committee. The inaugural prize for ‚ÄúArts and Literature‚Äù awarded by the Shanghai city Cultural Union. ‚ÄúPrize for Outstanding Work in the Service of Education in Shanghai‚Äù, awarded by the Shanghai Educational Bureau. An honorary prize awarded by Baogang steel. Honorary prize on various occasions for services to the high arts. Shanghai City Model Elderly Citizen Top Ten Award.

These changes are situated in both the body of the vertebrae and in the end plate of the neighboring disc. It is important to understand that Modic changes do not represent an illness, but are a simple descriptive term used by radiologists in MRI diagnostics to describe common degenerative processes quite often seen with ageing. Because Modic changes are not an illness, dedicated treatment is not required and there is currently no evidence for a specific therapy beyond common therapies against backpain. In general, theses changes resolve spontaneously and it lies at the center of the Modic classification that it contains three different stages from active inflammation over fatty bone marrow transformation to a spontaneously healed state with calcifications. Causes of back pain In 20% of the patients we can identify an anatomical reason for the pain,??? such as a lumbar disc herniation, or stenosis which is a reduction in the circumference of the spinal canal. There might be reasons for back pain that cannot be identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for example muscular pain. But other areas like knee or hip pain do a lot better when it comes to diagnosing the exact reasons for the pain. The low percentage for back diagnosis might be due to the fact that the back is a much more complex and complicated structure. Diagnosing modic changes Modic changes are characterized on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). The 3 Modic classifications were first described and defined by Dr. Michael Modic in 1988. Normal bone contains internal scaffolding, called trabeculae. Red bone marrow, which produces blood cells, is located in the hollows between the trabeculae. * In Modic type 1 there is vascular development in the vertebral body, with findings of inflammation and edema, but no trabecular damage or marrow changes. * In Modic type 2 there are changes in bone marrow, with fatty replacement of formerly red, cellular marrow normally seen there. With Modic type 2 changes the marrow is substituted by visceral fat, the same kind of fat we have on our hips and bellies. * Modic Changes type 3 are less common, with fractures of the trabecular bone, along with trabecular shortening and widening. Modic changes have been observed in dogs. Modic changes and pain Many studies have examined the relationship between Modic changes in the vertebrae in the spine and pain in the lower back. There are inconclusive correlation between having Modic changes and suffering from pain in the lower back. Studies have shown that patients with Modic changes are rather different from other patients with normal back pain. For example, 75 ‚Äì80 % of patients suffering from Modic changes have constant pain, which means they do not ever have a pain-free moment day or night. There might be fluctuations in the intensity, but no break from the pain. Treatment It is difficult to treat patients with Modic changes. Treatment that normally cures or help patients with normal back pain does not have effect on Modic changes or pain from Modic changes. The recommended treatment for long lasting pain in the lower back is exercises, normally aided by the instruction of a qualified clinician. This is often followed by muscle strengthening and fitness training. This treatment does help the vast majority of normal back pain patients. But studies have shown that patients with Modic changes showed much higher pain score than patients with normal back pain, and most importantly that their pain increased with training. Other recent studies cited state no clinical difference between load reduction and rest or doing physio in relation to management or improvement of the condition. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00454792 Since radiologists very frequently use the Modic classification in their reports and this leads to unsettledness in a lot of patients reading their reports, businessmen in Denmark and Norway founded private \\"Modic clinics\\" to exploit these unsecure patients. The entry-procedure into these private clinics begins with a payment of approx. 50 $ for a re-reading of the patients MRI. As stated above, there is currently no special therapy \\"against a radiology image- classification\\" and such a therapy is, with today's state of research, not necessary. Common physiotherapy exercises, aquajogging, warmth and, above all, the natural course of these Modic changes will, in most cases, after some time lead to pain relief. Research The following section is controversial with concerns over methodology and also potential conflicts of interest, in that some of the researchers are associated with a company which certifies clinicians to diagnose the condition for ¬£200. It is true that a study has been published, and results are interesting. However, spinal clinicians and researchers are agreed that further studies are needed, specifically fully blinded randomised controlled trials, to confirm or refute claims made in the published study. At this stage patients with low back pain should not consent to anti-biotic treatment without proper assessment and investigation under the care of a qualified spine surgeon or physician. Scientist Hanne Albert at a large back center in Europe, the Spine Centre of Southern Denmark led by Professor Claus Manniche, performed studies that have claimed that 80% of patients with Modic changes type 1 are cured or much improved after a cheap and simple antibiotic treatment. However, a more recent double blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter study from 2019 shows no evidence for the effect of antibiotics on back pain with Modic changes.

In 1996 she was the curator of the exhibition and the essay \\"Riccardo Muti alla Scala\\" (Leonardo Editore). Novels In 1999 she published her first novel L‚ÄôAmore segreto (Baldini & Castoldi) based on a secret love story revealed by an old lady to her lover's daughter 40 years later. In 2000 the novel was finalist at the literary award Bancarella and it was published in the Netherlands, Sweden, Brazil, Greece, Japan, Rumania and in 2010 it was translated into French (L‚Äôamour secret, Presses de la cit√©) and Germany (Eine geheime Liebe, Goldmann). Her second novel, L‚Äôaddio (Bompiani), set in the world of classical music, is the story of three women and their lifetime friendship. Olga, the main character, wants to be a costumes and set designer and her dreams come true when she works as an assistant for the famous edition of La Traviata directed by Luchino Visconti in 1955. Calvetti's third novel N√© con te n√© senza di te was released in 2004 and was inspired by Fran√ßois Truffaut's film The Woman Next Door: the murder-suicide of two lovers narrated by their best friend.

Box Love, St Martin's Press). The main character, Emma, is a woman with a brilliant career, a wonderful son, a kind ex-husband, some fantastic friends. She feels that something in her life must change and accepts the challenge offered by fate: she has received an inheritance from an aunt, a small stationery shop in the heart of Milan and - defying the ominous predictions of her accountant, \\"Faithful Enemy\\" - turns it into an extravagant bookshop called Dreams & Desires, which sells \\"only\\" love stories, because \\"literature is nothing but an uninterrupted stream of love\\". To Emma, books are a medicine for her clients: by fishing from the shelves classified as \\"Broken Hearts\\", \\"Missions Impossible\\" or Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, Emma serves magic potions from the love-embedded pages, for those disappointed in love and in search of a romantic trip, to rekindle dormant passions. Dreams & Desires soon become a refuge and a meeting place for a crowd of characters: Alice, the young, vivacious assistant, Mattia, Emma's teenage son, Gabriella, her lifelong- friend and men and women, young and old, who lead their lives among books old and new. Most importantly, thanks to her bookshop, Emma meets Federico, her first love. Now married, he lives in New York, where he works with the architect Renzo Piano on the brilliant renovation project of the Morgan Library, founded by the financier J.P. Morgan. Emma and Federico make a pact to bridge the gap that separates them by writing letters, sent between two intruder proof P.O. boxes. Once a year, on April the 10, the two lovers meet in Belle-Ile-en-Mer, a small island off the coast of Brittany, France, where they relive their love. The delicate balance of this contemporary love story is precarious. While Dreams & Desires expands into a popular coffee shop and an intimate hotel for writers, the Morgan Library reveals its secrets and becomes an architectural masterpiece in glass and steel, meanwhile Emma and Federico will the consequences of an unexpected and painful event, that only the hopeful heart of a young man may resolve.

As her debut novel, it was originally published in 2003 in Swedish, entitled Isprinsessan. The novel follows detective Patrik Hedstr√∂m and writer Erica Falck investigating a suspicious suicide. A sequel, The Preacher was published in 2004 and subsequently translated to English in 2009. Plot Erica Falck has returned to her family home in Fj√§llbacka after her parents died. While coping with the death of her parents, she is trying to work on a biography of Selma Lagerl√∂f, a Swedish author and the first female writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Patrik Hedstr√∂m, a detective, is assigned to investigate a case in which the victim, Erica's childhood friend Alex, is frozen in a bathtub. The investigation shows that the young woman's death occurred before she was placed in the tub, allowing the liquid to freeze around her as the temperature dropped far below freezing inside her apartment. Exactly when the furnace went out-of-order is a timely coincidence to the alleged suicide. At the prompting of Alex's parents, Erica begins to investigate the death of their daughter. Her breakthrough comes when she meets a police officer who is also investigating the mystery; together the two uncover dark secrets within the town. Erica and Patrick's fascination gives way to deep obsession as they struggle to determine the true circumstances surrounding the death. Erica visualizes a memoir about Alex, one that will answer questions about their missing friendship.

Themes The difficulty of parent-child relationships is a recurring theme in The Ice Princess. True to the genre of Scandinavian crime fiction (often called Nordic noir), a heavy emphasis is given to characterization and (especially in Lackberg's instance) the development of the small town where the crime occurs. The importance of the location is emphasized by the inclusion of a map of Fj√§llbacka, and the depictions of the landscape are both colorful and integral to the plot.

It was originally built as a grist mill, and was one of Henry Ford's \\"village industries.\\" The mill was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1967. Description Nankin Mills, c. 1918, with Henry Ford and Floyd Bassett on the porch 1945 village industries ad The Nankin Mills Nature Center is a two-and-a-half story Greek Revival mill building. It is framed and sided with clapboard. A one- story porch runs the width of the building. History Construction on the first mill on this site was begun in 1835. However, the construction was abandoned until 1842, when a new owner completed the building and installed an overshot water wheel. A small community, known as Pike's Peak, grew up around the mill. In addition to the mill, Pike's Peak boasted a blacksmith's shop, printing shop, general store, and post office. The original mill burned some time during the Civil War. The present mill was constructed in 1863 by Samuel Hardenbergh. In 1887, Hardenbergh sold the mill to Isaac Martin Lewis, who replaced the overshot water wheel with a more efficient turbine. In 1918, Henry Ford purchased the mill as part of his Village industries program. Ford developed his Village Industries in part to provide farm workers a stable source of income during the winter months. He converted the building into a small factory, and in 1920, twelve workers began producing screws for Ford. It was the second Village Industry to open, after the Ford Valve Plant in Northville. In 1927, Ford converted the site to make engravings and stencils; eventually it employed 70 people. However, the Village Industries experiment proved unprofitable, and after World War II the factory closed. In 1948, Ford donated the site to the Wayne County Road Commission. The commission remodeled the mill, and in 1956 it was opened as a nature center. In the mid-1980s, Nankin Mills became the headquarters of the Wayne County Park System. An addition was built in 1999, and in 2001 the original mill reopened as an interpretive center.

It was the largest county in Central Equatoria and one of the largest in the entire region of Equatoria. Its county seat was Juba, the state capital of Central Equatoria and the national capital of the Republic of South Sudan. Its population according to the disputed 2008 census conducted by the Republic of the Sudan, prior to South Sudanese independence, was 372,413. In 2015, the county was turned into the state of Jubek. Political geography As of 2011, the county's payams, or sub-counties, included Bungu, Dollo (or Dolo), Ganji, Gondokoro, Lirya, Lo'bonok, Lokiliri, Mangalla (or Mangala), Northern Bari, Rejaf, Rokon, Tijor, and Wonduruba, the latter of which was administrated by Central Equatoria state. Former payams that became defunct before independence included Jokala, Juba, Kator, and Muniki. In March 2011, Juba, Kator, and Muniki payams were consolidated into Juba proper under the administration of the Juba City Council. The county also included part of Bandingilo National Park in its northeast. It borders Terekaka County to its north and Lainya and Kajo Keji counties to its south, as well as Mundri East and Mundri West counties in the state of Western Equatoria to its west, and Eastern Equatoria, namely Lapon, Magwi, and Torit counties, to its east. History In August 2005, independence leader John Garang's funeral took place in Juba County. The month was also marked by ethnic violence in Juba and its environs. The villages of Katigiri and Wonduruba were inundated with refugees internally displaced by violence and looting in Juba County in February 2008. At least 750 people from Katigiri also relocated to Juba, the de facto metropolis of the county, during the looting. The United Nations, the county commissioner, and local militias responded to the situation. The county was the site of a month-and-a-half-long teachers' strike in November and December 2009 over furloughed salaries. The strike was resolved after the wages were paid. After the reorganisation of states decreed by President Salva Kiir Mayardit in 2015, Juba County became the Jubek State. In February 2016, the governor of the state decreed the creation of 7 new counties from the territory of the former county.

The 224th Field Ambulance was converted to an airborne unit in 1942, and assigned to the 3rd Parachute Brigade, part of the 6th Airborne Division. They first saw active service in 1944 during the invasion of Normandy, and remained in France until September. They were then withdrawn back to England only to return to the continent at the end of the year in response to the German surprise winter offensive in the Ardennes forest. Their final mission of the war was the airborne assault over the River Rhine in 1945. They remained in Germany until the final surrender in May that year. After the war the 224th remained with the 6th Airborne Division, and following a brief period in England were sent to Mandate Palestine on an internal security role. In 1948, the field ambulance and most of the division was disbanded. Background Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p. 21 In September 1941 the 1st Parachute Brigade began forming, comprising three parachute infantry battalions.Ferguson, p. 6 In keeping with British Army practice at the time, airborne supporting arms were created, including Royal Army Medical Corps volunteers.Cole, p. 4 Of the seven airborne field ambulances formed during the Second World War, two were glider borne the 181st and the 195th. While the other five were parachute trained the 16th, 127th, 133rd, 224th and the 225th.Cole, pp. 5‚Äì6 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance The 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance was formed in December 1942, by the conversion of the 224th Field Ambulance to parachute duties.Cole, p. 6 Once converted, they were assigned to the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the 6th Airborne Division.Ferguson, p. 16 The war establishment of a parachute field ambulance was 177 all ranks,Cole, p. 9 consisting of thirteen doctors in two surgical teams and four sections. The doctors could deal with 330 cases in a twenty-four-hour period. Each surgical team could handle 1.8 operations an hour. This rate could not be sustained and if they were required to operate the following day, the team had to be relieved after twelve hours.Cole, p. 8 The 224th Parachute Field Ambulance was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Alistair Young,Brock, p. 401 with a major as the second in command and a regimental sergeant major as the senior non-commissioned rank. Headquarters staff included two specialist surgeons and a specialist anaesthetist, a pharmacist and an Army Dental Corps dentist. To assist in the operating theatre and with post operative care, there were six operating room assistants, a sergeant nursing orderly and six nursing orderlies. Other medical staff were a sergeant sanitary assistant, a masseur, a dental orderly and five stretcher bearers, one of whom was trained as a shoemaker. The rest of the headquarters consisted of a quartermaster, clerks, cooks, storemen, an Army Physical Training Corps instructor, a barber and a joiner from the Royal Engineers.Cole, p. 222 Jeep fitted with litters for carrying wounded. There were four sub units of twenty men known as sections. Each section comprised an officer (doctor) and a staff sergeant (nursing orderly), under their command were three nursing orderlies, a clerk, a dutyman and thirteen stretcher bearers. A section was normally attached to a parachute battalion to supplement their own medical officer and medics.Cole, pp. 222‚Äì223 The last component of the Field Ambulance was the Royal Army Service Corps detachment, commanded by a captain, with a company sergeant major as second in command. They had fifty men under them, an electrician, a clerk, thirty-eight drivers, four motorcyclists and five vehicle mechanics.Cole, p. 223 It was normal to have at least two RASC drivers with two jeeps and a trailer attached to each section, the remaining men and vehicles stayed with the headquarters surgical teams.Cole, p. 86 All members of the Field Ambulance had to undergo a twelve- day parachute training course carried out at No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway. Initial parachute jumps were from a converted barrage balloon and finished with five parachute jumps from an aircraft. Anyone failing to complete this training was returned to his old unit. Those men who successfully completed the parachute course, were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings.Guard, p. 224Guard, p. 226 Operations Normandy On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division took part in Operation Tonga during the Normandy landings. The 3rd Parachute Brigade landed on their own drop zone to the north-east of Ranville. The brigade had to capture two bridges crossing the Caen canal and the River Orne and hold them until relieved by forces advancing from the British Sword beach. At the same time, they had to secure the landing zone for the divisions glider-borne forces arriving later that day.Ferguson, p. 17 The 224th commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel D.H. ThompsonCole, p. 80 was divided into groups for the landings. The commanding officer and sixty-five men who were to establish the Main Dressing Station (MDS) travelled in the same aircraft as brigade headquarters, while Nos 1, 2 and 3 Sections were attached to the 1st Canadian, 8th and 9th parachute battalions.Cole, p. 81 Arriving in Normandy from around 01:00, many of the unit landed too far to the east in the flooded marshes beside the River Dives.Saunders, p. 187 One of those men was the commanding officer who then spent three weeks trying to rejoin the unit from behind German lines before being captured. The members of the 224th who landed on the correct drop zone proceeded to set up their Main Dressing Station in a farm at Le Mesnil. By noon, around two-thirds of the 22nd were still missing, but the MDS had managed to treat fifty-five wounded and conduct ten surgical operations. The following day, the Germans counter-attacked and the MDS was surrounded on three sides with the nearest German forces only away, but they kept on operating. Over the next few days, the front line was very fluid and it was not unknown for the unit's ambulances returning to the MDS from battalion aid posts to drive through German patrols and positions.Cole, pp. 90‚Äì91 Being co-located with brigade headquarters, the MDS could not be given the protection of the Red Cross and was subjected to small arms and artillery fire. It was also twice attacked by Royal Air Force rocket firing Typhoons. On 18 June during a German artillery attack, all the unit's transport, apart from one ambulance jeep and two captured trucks, were destroyed.Cole, p. 91 After the last attack, Brigade headquarters issued orders for the MDS to move further to the rear at Ecarde. Between 6 and 19 June, the MDS had treated 800 wounded and carried out 112 surgical operations.Shilleto, p. 39 The 224th remained at Ecarde until the first week in August. During their time there, they established a divisional clinic and assisted with the casualties from the British attempts to capture Caen. On 7 August, they moved closer to the front at RiverbellaCole, p. 94 when the 6th Airborne Division was ordered to cross the River Dives and advance north along the French coast. The 224th and the division's two other field ambulances leap-frogged each other to keep up with the leading troops and have at least one MDS open for casualties. By the end of the month, the division had reached the River Seine. They were ordered to halt and by September had been withdrawn back to England.Cole, p. 95 While in Normandy, the division's three medical units had treated 6,722 casualties.Cole, p. 105 Germany Parachute Field Ambulance troops just before boarding their aircraft. The next airborne operation the 224th was involved in was Operation Varsity the crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. The divisions drop zones were on the high ground to the east of Hamminkeln.Cole, p. 158 As this was the first airborne operation in daylight without the element of surprise, the 224th were warned to expect around 600 casualties.Cole, p. 159 The 224ths airborne contingent was transported across the Rhine, in seven aircraft and three gliders.Cole, p. 160 The flight was successful apart from one glider having to land in France when its tow rope snapped. The rest of the 224th landing under fire had four men killed and a number wounded by the German machine guns. Still under the German guns, they started clearing the casualties from the drop zone.Cole, p. 161 At midday brigade headquarters ordered the 224th move to Bergenfurth, where they established the MDS in the village church.Cole, p. 162 Casualties continued to mount and the supply of stretchers was exhausted. Two of the unit's stretcher bearers were awarded the Military Medal, for returning to the landing zone which was still under fire, to retrieve stretchers from the crashed gliders.Cole, p. 163 It was around the same time that Corporal Frederick Topham was awarded the Victoria Cross. Two medics had been killed trying to assist a wounded man on the drop zone. Topham left cover to help, he was wounded in the face but succeeded in carrying the casualty to safety. By the end of the first day the 224th had seven dead, nine wounded and seven missing. They had treated 212 wounded and conducted nine surgical operations.Cole, p. 164 The ground forces caught up with the 6th Airborne division on 24 March and by 2 May the division had advanced across Germany to Wismar on the Baltic sea.Cole, p. 170 From then to the end of the war a week later the 224th remained static treating wounded soldiers, civilians and ex prisoners of war.

The film documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and the group's creative process. Guggenheim, who was commissioned by U2 to create the film to commemorate the record's 20th anniversary, spent several months in 2011 developing the documentary. The band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios in Berlin where parts of the album were recorded, and during rehearsals in Winnipeg for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film contains unreleased scenes from the group's 1988 motion picture Rattle and Hum, along with archival footage and stills from the Achtung Baby recording sessions. Development of the album's emblematic song \\"One\\" is recounted through the replaying of old recording tapes. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2011, the first time in the festival's history that a documentary was screened as the opening film. Beginning in October, a series of television broadcasts commenced, including showings on BBC Television, Showtime, and Super Channel. The film was bundled with the deluxe editions of Achtung Babys 20th anniversary reissue and was later released as standalone copies on Blu-ray and DVD on December 12, 2011. Reviews from critics were mixed; many found the insight into the band's creative process informative, while others judged that the film did not provide adequate in-depth coverage of the album. From the Sky Down was nominated for the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. Background After the commercial and critical success of their 1987 album The Joshua Tree, U2 produced a motion picture and companion album titled Rattle and Hum that was subject to a critical backlash. The band's exploration of American music for the project was variously labelled as \\"pretentious\\" and \\"misguided and bombastic\\". The group's high exposure and their reputation for being overly serious led to accusations of grandiosity and self-righteousness. In addition to the criticism they faced, U2 dealt with internal creative dissatisfaction; lead vocalist Bono believed they were musically unprepared for their success, and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, \\"We were the biggest, but we weren't the best\\".Flanagan (1996), pp. 4, 25‚Äì26 Towards the end of the Lovetown Tour in 1989, Bono announced onstage that it was \\"the end of something for U2\\", and that \\"we have to go away and ... dream it all up again\\".de la Parra (1994), pp. 138‚Äì139 Wishing to reinvent themselves and seeking inspiration from German reunification, the group de-camped to Hansa Studios in Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno to record Achtung Baby.Flanagan (1995), p. 7 The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly took their toll: the group considered breaking up, but they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song \\"One\\".Flanagan (1995), pp. 6‚Äì11 With improved morale, the group completed the album in Dublin in 1991. In November, Achtung Baby was released to critical acclaim. Musically, it incorporated influences from the alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music of the time. Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. The album and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, whereby they abandoned their earnest public image for a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.Graham (2004), p. 44 Achtung Baby has been one of the group's most commercially successful records, selling 18 million copies. Production Director Davis Guggenheim was allowed access to the band's archives for the film, and despite the group's reservations, he was given final say over the film's content. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Achtung Babys original release, U2 reissued the record in several formats in October 2011. Leading up to the anniversary, the band was unsure how much attention to pay to a past album while still actively writing and recording new material. Guitarist The Edge said, \\"How big a deal do we make of an anniversary when we're in the middle of what we're doing now? We had a hard time figuring that out. We're not a heritage act. We're still very active. But this record was so pivotal that we felt it was OK to revisit it.\\" Director Davis Guggenheim was subsequently commissioned by the band to make a film about Achtung Baby in six months. As a fan of U2 since his youth and having previously collaborated with The Edge for the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud, Guggenheim agreed to the project. His goal for the film was to explain how U2 managed to remain together for so long, in contrast to other rock groups that have been undone by internal conflict; he described the band's longevity as \\"fighting against that law of physics\\". Guggenheim also sought to tell the story of how the band transformed themselves musically over the course of Achtung Babys recording sessions. alt=A ballroom with hardwood floors, and a ceiling decorated with chandeliers and octagon-shaped tiles. The wall on the left is decorated with dark wood panels, red walls, and windows. On the right is a small stage with a piano. While U2 were on the South American leg of their U2 360¬∞ Tour in March‚ÄìApril 2011, Guggenheim requested complete access to the band's archives in Dublin. To his surprise, they complied. While researching footage, the director was impressed by an unused Rattle and Hum video that he found, describing it as \\"rare and beautiful\\". Some of the footage included scenes of Bono throwing a tantrum in a dressing room and the band performing in a blues club. Guggenheim conducted the audio interviews with the band members that comprise much of the film while they were in Santiago, Chile. After their touring obligations in South America ended, the band met Guggenheim in Berlin for two days in May \\"to go back to the scene of the crime\\". They were filmed at Hansa Studios performing songs from the album and speaking to Guggenheim in lengthy individual interviews. Additionally, the group were filmed touring Berlin and driving a Trabant, an automobile that previously appeared in the album artwork for Achtung Baby and was incorporated into the lighting system of the Zoo TV Tour. The band expected a less personal treatment for the film and were at times uncomfortable with the extent to which Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, \\"I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique.\\" Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, \\"They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand.\\" Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, \\"They were over the moon. They loved it.\\" The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed. Release From the Sky Down premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on September 8, 2011. It marked the first time in the festival's history that a documentary was shown as the opening film. Bono, The Edge, and Guggenheim attended the premiere and appeared on stage prior to the film's showing to make brief remarks. The first television broadcast of From the Sky Down was held in the UK on BBC Television on October 9, 2011, as part of the Imagine series, while the first American broadcast was on October 29, 2011, on the Showtime television network. Two days later, a 74-minute version of the film was commercially released on DVD in the \\"√úber Deluxe\\" and \\"Super Deluxe\\" editions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. Canadian distribution rights were acquired by BBC Worldwide Canada, who licensed it for broadcast on Super Channel on November 19, 2011. Standalone copies of the full, 85-minute director's cut of From the Sky Down were released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 12, 2011, with bonus footage of the band performing at Hansa Studios and a question-and-answer session with Bono, The Edge, and Guggenheim from TIFF. Reception Critics' reviews of From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an enthusiastic review, describing it as \\"one of the most transcendent close-up looks at the process of creating rock & roll I've ever seen.\\" In his opinion, the film was a \\"stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together.\\" Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an \\"intriguing\\" documentary that \\"becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't.\\" The reviewer said the film is \\"refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled\\" and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an \\"essential companion piece\\" to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that \\"the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored\\". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will \\"come out with a new appreciation of what it takes to be U2\\". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs \\"Mysterious Ways\\" and \\"One\\", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a \\"complete record\\" of Achtung Babys conception, but that it \\"offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished\\". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of \\"One\\" as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, \\"This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed.\\" Other reviewers were more critical. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said the film \\"has a few segments that get beyond platitudes\\". He enjoyed the sequences that highlighted individual songs but noted the documentary \\"doesn't have much in the way of full songs\\". Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called From the Sky Down a \\"procedural look\\" at the album's inception. Although he enjoyed Bono's humorous insights, Zeitchik said that \\"much of the movie is abstract, insider stuff about how he and others find inspiration\\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out the limited scope of the film, calling it \\"neither a comprehensive portrait nor one of those tossed-off featurettes that would be at home only as the filler for a commemorative Achtung Baby boxed set\\". Commenting on Guggenheim's filmmaking style, DeFore judged that some of his attempts to make the film more \\"movie-ish\\" failed to enhance the subject material. In the reviewer's opinion, this gave the \\"impression of a filmmaker who can tell this story competently but isn't quite up to making a lasting film about one of rock history's most successful bands\\". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, calling it \\"occasionally enlightening but mostly frustrating\\". The review lamented the lack of coverage of most of the album's songs, and in Hyden's opinion, it was ironic that the band was trying to live down the \\"ego- inflating\\" Rattle and Hum in a film that he also considered \\"ego-inflating\\". From the Sky Down was nominated for the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.

They were formed in 1993 and were active until 2002, and have been on hiatus since then. They have a 7\\" on Fat Wreck Chords, 4 full-length albums released on Honest Don's Records and a split EP with the band Divit that was released on Coldfront Records. According to Last.fm, Diesel Boy's most popular tracks are \\"Titty Twister\\", \\"Looks That Kill\\" (M√∂tley Cr√ºe cover), \\"She's My Queen\\" and \\"Stroking My Cat\\". History The band was formed in summer 1993, and soon after the world was introduced to their clever use of puns with their 7\\" release on Fat Wreck Chords, aptly titled Strap on Seven Inch, with four tracks, the first of which was \\"Titty Twister\\". Shortly afterwards in September 1996, Cock Rock would be released as their debut full length, released on Honest Don's Records, a partner label of Fat Wreck Chords, for which Diesel Boy was the flagship band. Ryan Greene produced all four albums the band would eventually release. The band toured relentlessly from 1995 to 2002. It is estimated that they played in 40 of the 50 U.S. states, every province in Canada (where it is arguable that the band enjoyed its biggest following), Europe for three times, and Australia. During this time they played with the likes of No Use for a Name, NOFX, Good Riddance, The Vandals, Strung Out, SNFU, Gob, The Goober Patrol, The Ataris, Satanic Surfers, and The Sugar Hill Gang. Strung Out took them on their first U.S./Canada tour which followed the buzz created by appearance of the band's instant classic \\"Titty Twister\\", on the Fat Records compilation Survival of the Fattest. Their second album, Venus Envy (1998), marked the departure of drummer and original member, Mike (Baump) Schaus. Geoff (Lackey) Arcuri, formerly of the Florida band Shyster, joined Diesel Boy in late 1998. A third album followed in 1999 called Sofa King Cool. Diesel Boy appears, as a band, while performing their own material from the Cock Rock album, on an episode of Freaks and Geeks called \\"Moshing and Noshing\\" that aired in 2000. Following their 2001 album Rode Hard and Put Away Wet, the band unofficially split up. Vocalist Diesel Dave said in a 2011 interview that \\"things just got wound down\\". In 2006, the band created a MySpace page and later in 2009 a Facebook page. In 2011, the band got back together and on July 18, 2011 announced on their Facebook page that they will write a new album. Several songs were composed, but due to the geographic difficulties (Diesel Dave was based in Seattle whereas the other members in California) as well as family reasons were not able to complete the album, and no musical content has been released since. The band did however play some gigs, such as at the Hits and Pits Tour in Australia in March 2013. In 2015 the band cancelled their appearance at the GROEZROCK festival in Meerhout, Belgium with no explanation. The band's vocalist, Diesel Dave, remains connected to writing by free-lancing for various publications, weekly magazines (such as the Seattle Weekly) and various blogs including a health industry publications. In 2016, Diesel Dave launched a new band called Dirty Outs along with an EP containing six songs.

COSECSA delivers a common surgical training programme with an internationally bench-marked exam and qualification. COSECSA is a non-profit making body that currently operates in 14 countries in the sub-Saharan region: Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  History  COSECSA grew out of the Association of Surgeons of East Africa (ASEA). ASEA was formally inaugurated in Nairobi, Kenya on 9 November 1950. In 1996, in response to perceived inadequacies of surgical training in the region, the ASEA steering committee decided to create the College of Surgeons of East, Central & Southern Africa (COSECSA). These inadequacies were seen to be the limited capacity of university teaching hospitals' surgical training programmes, the increasing difficulty in accessing UK surgical training programmes at that time and the variability of training programmes from country to country. The official inauguration of the College was held in Nairobi in December 1999. In December 2001, at the first annual general meeting in Lusaka, Zambia the council of the college was elected by the foundation fellows.  Training model  COSECSA has been described as a \\"college without walls.\\" Trainee surgeons undertake their clinical training in accredited hospitals under supervision of an accredited trainer. The academic component of the programme is delivered online, through an e-learning portal, and through workshops held across the region.  Academic structure  COSECSA has two programmes: (a) Membership: A certificate of competence in surgery at General Medical Officer Grade (minimum 2 years training) and (b) Fellowship: A specialist qualification in General Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Urology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery, Plastic Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology (minimum 5 years training). As of December 2016, COSECSA has graduated a cumulative total of 206 Fellows, with another 389 trainees actively training in 60 accredited training hospitals. At that time, there were 973 members and fellows of the college. A complete list of current fellows and members is available at this online reference.  Partner organisations  COSECSA is a founding association of the Pan African Association of Surgeons. The College also has a long-standing collaboration programme with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

The theory of knowledge (TOK) requirement is central to the educational philosophy of the Diploma Programme. The CAS requirement is a fundamental part of the programme and takes seriously the importance of life outside the world of scholarship, providing a refreshing counterbalance to academic studies.\\" In Bilkent Erzurum, in addition to the weekly curricular lessons 1 CAS, 1 EE and 2 TOK lessons are included on a weekly basis.

In just one of these atrocitiestaking place over September 29‚Äì30, 194133,771 Jewish men, women and children were killed in a single Einsatzgruppe operation. Background On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. The German army crossed the 1939 former Polish-Soviet border soon thereafter and arrived in Kiev on September 19, 1941. Ten days later, following an explosion at the German army headquarters, Jews were rounded up, marched out of town, made to strip naked and massacred; they were stacked up, layer upon layer, at Babi Yar (literally, a \\"grandmother's ravine.\\") For decades after World War II, Soviet authorities were unwilling to acknowledge that the mass murder of Jews at Babi Yar was part of the Holocaust. The victims were generalized as Soviet; mention of their Jewish identity was impermissible, even though their deaths were every bit as much a consequence of the Nazi's genocidal Final Solution as the death camps of occupied Poland (Ehrenburg, Pravda 1944). There was, too, a virtual ban on mentioning the participation of the local police, or the role of the auxiliary battalions sent to Kiev by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B) in rounding up, guarding and murdering their Jewish countrymen. In order to make the connection the Soviets worked so hard to suppress, Holocaust scholars have come to call events such as the massacres at Babi Yar \\"the Holocaust by bullet.\\" By November 1941, the number of Jews shot dead at Babi Yar exceeded 75,000, according to an official report written by SS commander Paul Blobel. But Babi Yar remained the site of mass executions for two more years after the murder of most of Kiev's Jewish community in the fall of 1941. Later victims included prisoners of war, Soviet partisans, Ukrainian nationalists and Gypsies. Over 100,000 more people died there. The deaths of these non-Jewish victims facilitated the Soviet Union's postwar efforts to suppress recognition of Babi Yar's place in the history of the Holocaust, especially in the aftermath of the 1952 executions of prominent Jewish intellectuals dubbed the \\"Night of the Murdered Poets.\\" Authors The atrocity was first remembered by the Jews of Kiev through a manuscript poem by Ilya Selvinsky, called I Saw It!. Even though it wasn't written specifically about Babi Yar, it was broadly received as such. Poems by Holovanivskyi, Ozerov, Ilya Ehrenburg and Pavel Antokolsky (Death Camp) soon followed, but the Jewish identity of the victims was revealed only through \\"coded\\" references. ;Lyudmila Titova Possibly the first known poem on the subject was written in Russian the same year the massacres took place, by Liudmila Titova, a young Jewish-Ukrainian poet from Kiev and an eyewitness to the events. Her poem, Babi Yar, was discovered only in the 1990s. ;Mykola Bazhan Mykola Bazhan wrote a poem called Babi Yar in 1943, explicitly depicting the massacres in the ravine. Bazhan was nominated for the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature. The Party forced him to decline the nomination.Lev Fridman, in Odessa Review, October/November 2016 ;Yevgeny Yevtushenko Yevgeny Yevtushenko's Babiyy Yar broke the long official silence about the connection between Babi Yar and the Holocaust. In 1961, Yevgeny Yevtushenko published his poem Babiy Yar in a leading Russian periodical, in part to protest the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize Babi Yar as a Holocaust site. The poem's first line is \\"Nad Babim Yarom pamyatnikov nyet\\" (\\"There are no monuments over Babi Yar.\\") The anniversary of the massacre was still observed in the context of the \\"Great Patriotic War\\" throughout the 1950s and 60s; the code of silence about what it meant for the Jews was broken only in 1961, with the publication of Yevtushenko's Babiyy Yar, in Literaturnaya GazetaLiteraturnaya Gazeta, September 19, 1961. The poet denounced both Soviet historical revisionism and still-common anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union of 1961. \\"[I]t spoke not only of the Nazi atrocities, but also of the Soviet government's own persecution of Jewish people.\\"Patterson, Donald, Renowned Poet to Visit City, Greensboro News & Record, April 8, 1999.

It was translated into English by Roman Turovsky. ;Ilya Ehrenburg Ilya Ehrenburg (born in Kiev) was 50 at the time of the massacre, living in Moscow Ehrenburg penned six poems about the Holocaust that first appeared without titles (identified only by numbers) in 1945-46. They were published in three magazines based in Moscow: Novy Mir (New World), Znamya (The Banner) and Oktyabr' (October) (). In one, he wrote of the \\"grandmother's ravine\\" through the repetitive use of words: Now, every ravine is my utterance, And every ravine is my home.Original in Russian by Ilya Ehrenburg (1944): \\"–¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –º–Ω–µ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —è—Ä –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º, –ò –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —è—Ä —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –º–Ω–µ –¥–æ–º.\\" (Maxim D. Shrayer 2010, ibidem.) The actual title of the poem, Babi Yar, was restored only in a 1959 collection of his work. Other authors In 1943, Sava Holovanivskyi wrote Avraam (Abraham) about Babi Yar, and Kievan poet Olga Anstei wrote (Kirillov Ravines, another name for Babi Yar.) She and her husband, poet Ivan Elagin, defected from the Soviet Union to the West that year. Undated poems about Babi Yar were written by Leonid Pervomayskiy, In Babi Yar, and Leonid Vysheslavsky, Cross of Olena Teliha. In 1944, Ilya Ehrenburg wrote his Babi Yar, reprinted in 1959, and in 1946 Lev Ozerov wrote and published his long poem Babi Yar. Lev Ozerov's long poem titled Babi Yar first appeared in Oktyabr' magazine's March‚ÄìApril 1946 issue.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Bowland, the archdeaconry of Craven, and the Diocese of Leeds. Its benefice is united with those of St Oswald, Horton-in-Ribblesdale and St John the Evangelist, Langcliffe. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Before this church was built, Stainforth was part of the parish of St Alkelda, Giggleswick. The church was built at the instigation of three sisters from a local gentry family, the Dawsons. It was constructed between 1839 and 1842 to a design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. The church was consecrated by Rev Charles Longley, the Bishop of Ripon on 29 September 1842. It was \\"thoroughly improved\\" in 1873. Architecture St Peter's is constructed in squared rubble stone with ashlar dressings and slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, a porch at the southeast, a lower single-bay chancel with a northeast vestry, and a west tower. The architectural style is \\"impeccably\\" Perpendicular. The tower is in three stages that are separated by string courses, and it has buttresses at the corners. The top string course is embellished with three carved heads. On the west side of the tower is a doorway, above which is a single-light window with a cinquefoil head. On each side of the top stage is a two-light bell opening with slate louvres and cinquefoil heads. The tower is surmounted by an embattled parapet with gargoyles. There are clock faces on the west and east sides. Along the wall of the nave, the bays are separated by buttresses, each of which contains a three-light window. The chancel has a four-light east window and an embattled parapet. The vestry has a chimney disguised as a turret. The stained glass in the east window and some of the other windows is by William Wailes. Above the east window is the heraldic shield of the Dawson family. The two-manual organ was made by Nicholson. There is a ring of three bells, all cast in 1842 by Thomas Mears II at Whitechapel Bell Foundry, but these are no longer ringable.

Life  He was born in Corfu in 1866. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy and graduated on 12 August 1887 as an artillery second lieutenant. Promoted to lieutenant in 1892, he fought in the Greco- Turkish War of 1897 as a battery commander. He was subsequently appointed to the Army Staff Service, and served in it until 1913, being promoted to captain (1902), major (1910) and lieutenant colonel (1912). In May 1914 he was placed as military attache to the Greek embassy to Serbia (then bound to Greece with a defensive alliance), returning in August 1915 to assume the direction of the Army Academy. Due to the mobilization ordered in September 1915, when Greek PM Eleftherios Venizelos prepared to come to Serbia's aid against the Austrian attack, the Academy was dismissed and Vlachopoulos was placed in command of the V Army Corps at Patras. During the National Schism, he sided with King Constantine I against Venizelos. He remained at Patras until May 1917, when he returned to head the Army Academy. After King Constantine's forced exile in June and the assumption of leadership by Venizelos, Vlachopoulos was suspended from active service and forcibly retired. Following the Venizelist electoral defeat in November 1920, he was recalled to active duty and placed as Chief of the Army Staff Service. Soon, however, he requested and received a transfer to an operational command in Asia Minor, where he commanded the III Army Corps (January‚ÄìMay 1921) and II Army Corps (May‚ÄìJuly 1921). He was then placed in charge of the Asia Minor Superior General Military Command, which covered the rear areas of the Army of Asia Minor, and in June 1922 he was dispatched to Eastern Thrace to assume command of the IV Army Corps. Following the defeat of the Greek army in Asia Minor by the Turks in August 1922, he was dismissed from active command and suspended from active duty in November 1923. He finally retired in March 1928 after reaching the statutory age limit. He died in 1960.

The systematic name of this enzyme is carbamate hydrolyase. In E. coli, cyanase is an inducible enzyme and is encoded for by the cynS gene. Cyanate is a toxic anion, and cyanase catalyzes the metabolism into the benign products of carbon dioxide and ammonia. Enzyme Reaction Cyanase catalyzes the metabolic conversion of toxic cyanate to carbamate (H2NCOO‚àí). The enzyme does this by first catalyzing the conversion of cyanate to carbamate, which then spontaneously decomposes to carbon dioxide and ammonia: # cyanate (OCN‚àí) + HCO3‚àí \\\\+ H+ \\\\rightleftharpoons carbamate (H2NCOO‚àí) + CO2 # carbamate (H2NCOO‚àí) + H+ \\\\rightleftharpoons NH3 \\\\+ CO2 (spontaneous) The resulting net reaction is: :cyanate (OCN‚àí) + HCO3‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\rightleftharpoons NH3 \\\\+ 2 CO2 Cyanase enzyme catalyzes the reaction of bicarbonate and cyanate forming carbamate, to be rapidly decomposed into carbon dioxide and ammonia. The two adjacent anion binding sights signified by the catalytic Arg 96 residues on different monomers allow this reaction to occur in the pocket. Created on ChemDraw. The kinetic mechanism is a rapid equilibrium where bicarbonate and cyanate both act as substrates. Bicarbonate acts a recycling substrate to cyanase in the production carbamate which then decomposes to complete the metabolism, rather than metabolism via a hydrolysis reaction as formerly believed. A positively charged active site forms a pocket with two anion binding sites, bonded via ionic interaction. Positively charged amino acids that make up the protein help form this site between subunits. This adjacent anion binding site structure accommodates a complex of cyanate and bicarbonate, allowing the carbamate producing reaction to proceed. Enzyme Structure Some bacteria can overcome the toxicity of environmental cyanate by degrading it via this enzyme. Cyanate hydratase is found in bacteria and plants. Cyanase is functionally active as a homodecamer, composed of 5 complexes of dimers. Each of these monomer subunits is 17 kDa and supports half-site binding of substrates. The cyanase monomer is composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain shows structural similarity to the DNA- binding alpha-helix bundle motif. The C-terminal domain has an 'open fold' with no structural homology to other proteins. The dimer structure reveals the C-terminal domains to be intertwined, and a decamer is formed by a pentamer of these dimers. The active site of the enzyme is located between dimers and is composed of residues from four adjacent subunits of the homodecamer. Connecting these two domains in the monomer is the single cysteine residue. The disulfide bond links 156 amino acid units. Forming the larger complexes of the pentamer and decamer requires the presence of cyanate, or a substrate analog like azide. The final native enzyme complex is a complex of 5 dimers. The crystallization of cyanase shows that cyanase crystals are triclinic with one homodecamer in the asymmetric unit. The active site of cyanase accommodates two anions, bicarbonate and cyanate. Three catalytic residues, Arg96, Glu99, and Ser122, form this pocket that stabilizes the anions with ionic interactions. The positively charged and polar amino acid residues allow the active site to bind anions. The active site sits between dimers, noted by the Arg96 in each monomer to be in close proximity. Cyanase pentamer with labeled arginine residues shown. Circles indicate active pockets where the 96th residues are arginines and provide a catalytic pocket for the enzyme mechanism to take place. Created in PyMol from http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6B6M. The structure of cyanase has been shown to be similar in its prokaryotic and eukaryotic forms. Enzyme Activity Cyanase is regulated both transcriptionally and in its enzymatic activity. Transcription of cyanase is elevated with the presence of extracellular cyanate, a toxic ion, but also down regulated by the presence of excess arginine, the catalytic amino acid. Cyanase requires the product of the reaction catalyzed by cyanate permease. Activity of cyanase is also dependent on the concentration of its substrates, cyanate and bicarbonate. Because bicarbonate is itself a recycling substrate and the kinetics of cyanase include a rapid and random equilibrium, bicarbonate can also act as an enzyme inhibitor. At low concentrations, bicarbonate shows uncompetitive inhibition, where it binds to the one of enzyme's anionic binding sites, and inhibit cyanate binding, or bicarbonate can bind once more so that the enzyme complex is bound to two bicarbonates in its double anion active site. At higher concentrations, the trend moves toward non-competitive inhibition, where the incorrect, dead-end complex must decompose to the initial separated units before the binding action can begin again. This random equilibrium of cyanate and bicarbonate complexing with the enzyme causing substrate inhibition is referred to as ping pong inhibition. Functional Relevance Cyanase is an important enzyme for plants and microbacteria as cyanate is a toxic enzyme that is prevalent in many environments. Further cyanase activity has been found to be encoded in cynH, a gene only found in marine cyanobacteria. There is a dodecapeptide, a partial region near the N-terminus of cyanate, that as a novel cationic Œ±-helical antimicrobial peptide, known by CL 14-25. Cyanase is also important as an energy metabolizer to fix Nitrogen in nitrifiers. Cyanate is an important source of reduced nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and although it is a toxic ion, it can be converted to ammonium and carbon dioxide by a cyanase enzyme, supplying energetic Nitrogen compounds to the organism. The activity of cyanase is heavily dependent on the present of bicarbonate, and to overcome this bottleneck, a combined application of cyanase and carbonic anhydrase has been used in a study.

History The union was founded in 1869 and its membership quickly rose to 4,000, but within a year had fallen back to 2,000. In December 1870, William Crawford became the union's President, and was able to rebuild its membership, the DMA soon becoming the largest miners' union in the UK.Sidney Webb, The Story of the Durham Miners The union saw rapid success, with the abolition of the unpopular Yearly Bond in 1872, while a short strike in 1874 began a process of agreeing wages across the county. A longer strike in 1879 was unsuccessful in preventing cuts to wages, but action in 1890 ensured that the district was the first in the county to adopt a standard seven-hour day. The prolonged strike of 1892 against a proposed 15% cut in wages ended with an agreement to accept a 10% cut. In these early days, the DMA was part of the Miners' National Union, and supported Lib-Lab candidates; both Crawford and John Wilson serving local constituencies. Although the union affiliated to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) in 1892, it was expelled the following year after refusing to join the national strike. It again attempted to join in 1897, but asked to be bound only on questions of wages, which was not permitted. In particular, the Durham union opposed the Eight Hours Bill, which was strongly promoted by the MFGB. The union finally joined the MFGB in 1908, following the passage of the Eight Hours Bill. In addition, by 1900, membership had risen to 80,000. While the union represented the large majority of miners in County Durham, some in specialist roles were represented by the Durham County Colliery Enginemen's Association, the Durham Colliery Mechanics' Association, and the Durham Cokemen's Association. The four unions worked together in the Durham County Mining Federation Board, the secretary of which was invariably the secretary of the DMA. The union became the Durham Area of the National Union of Mineworkers in 1945 and is now the North East Area of the NUM, although it retains its name and identity.

Loosely based on the novel Expressway written by Trevor Dudley-Smith, the film chronicles the aftermath of a 39-car smash-up in California.Review Summary of Smash-Up on Interstate 5 (1976) The New York Times. Retrieved on 2011-07-28  Plot  The film is set on Interstate 5 in California on the date of July 4, 24 hours before the summer vacation will officially commence. From the beginning, California Highway Patrol sergeant Sam Marcum (Robert Conrad) announces in a voice-over that a 39-car smash-up will be the cause of 62 injured people and fourteen deaths. A selection of the people involved are followed up to 48 hours preceding the accident. Other than Sam, who is chasing the murderer of his colleague on the highway, the film focuses on the elderly couple Al and June Pearson (Buddy Ebsen and Harriet Nelson), who are setting out to a beach resort to forget the fact that June is suffering from a terminal disease. Meanwhile, a woman named Erica (Vera Miles) is troubled by a gang of bikers including rebellious Burnsey (Sue Lyon), when she is rescued by young Dale (David Groh). In other sub-plots, Lee Bassett (Scott Jacoby) becomes a murder suspect when he is forced to pick up a young couple on the run, Penny and Pete (Bonnie Ebsen and George O'Hanlon, Jr.). Laureen (Donna Mills), a nurse with feelings for Sam, struggles with doubts of marrying him. Barbara Hutton (Sian Barbara Allen), a young mother, is panicked when she finds her husband Jimmy (Tommy Lee Jones), an officer, shot. All these stories come together when a massive car crash changes their lives for good. 43 hours before the accident, Erica meets with her colleague Trudy (Terry Moore) at a sleazy bar, where she is introduced to a free-spirited life style. She is picked up by a doctor, Danny (Herb Edelman), but leaves the bar without him, despite his attempts to flirt with her. Meanwhile, Penny and Pete rob a gas station, and a gunfight leaves Pete injured, and the gas station owner shot. Seventeen hours later, they steal a car and force the owner, Lee Bassett, to drive under gunpoint. Nearby, Sergeant Marcum holds a truck for speeding, driven by Randy (Barry Hamilton), and issues a warning to the owner, who is in the back having intercourse with a woman (Cindy Daly). Two hours later, Erica is phoned by Danny, who is warning her that he will come over. To flee the home, Erica calls her daughter Susie, asking her if she can come over in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Pete shoots Officer Hutton when he attempts to hold him and Penny and Lee over. Unbeknownst to Pete, Hutton's wife Barbara has just got into labor and requests Jimmy's presence. Laureen, who assists the birth, is bothered by Sam yet again. She tries to explain that she does not want to marry a man with a dangerous job, considering her wish to start a happy family. The discussion is interrupted by the news of Jimmy's death, leaving Barbara heartbroken. Back at the car with the fugitive couple, Lee is able to steal Pete's gun due to Pete's severe injuries, and leaves only to steal another car, afraid that the police will account him as an accessory to murder because of his past as a criminal. Penny, who does not know Pete very well, convinces Lee to take her with him. Sometime later, a group of bikers start to harass Erica on the road. Medical school drop-out and truck driver Dale witnesses the situation and starts a fight, which lasts until the bikers hear police sirens. The police, though, are more occupied with Lee's car, which they find with Pete's now lifeless body in it. At the beach house, June enjoys and appreciates her husband's presence, though secretly suffers from her disease and refuses to take her medicine. Instead, she walks into the ocean and attempts to drown herself, only to be rescued by her husband. Just over 15 hours before the accident, Erica grows accustomed to Dale and spends the night with him in a motel, even though she has some doubts about his young age. Nearby, romance also blossoms between Lee and Penny when she tells him about her troubled childhood. The following morning, only an hour before the smash-up, June tries to explain her suicide attempt, while Erica breaks up with Dale, afraid of commitment. Dale initially accepts the situation and drives off, but soon makes a U-turn to follow Erica, declaring his love to her from his car. Meanwhile, Sergeant Marcum is informed which van fugitive Lee and Penny are driving and starts a massive chase. The smash-up soon ensues, killing Lee, Penny, Al, and Burnsey's biker boyfriend Andy (Joel Parks), and badly injuring Dale. When Laureen arrives at the scene, she realizes how much she cares for Sam and they reconcile while taking care of the injured people.

Aromatic polyketides are assembled by a type II (iterative) polyketide synthase in bacteria. Iterative type II polyketide syntheses produce polyketide chains of variable but defined length from a specific starter unit and a number of extender units. They also specify the initial regiospecific folding and cyclisation pattern of nascent polyketides either through the action of a cyclase (CYC) subunit or through the combined action of site-specific ketoreductase and CYC subunits. Additional CYCs and other modifications may be necessary to produce linear aromatic polyketides. The Tetracenomycin polyketide synthesis protein, tcmI, from Streptomyces glaucescens catalyses an aromatic rearrangement in the biosynthetic pathaway of tetracenomycin C from Streptomyces coelicolor. The protein is a homodimer where each subunit forms a beta-alpha-beta fold belonging to the ferrodoxin fold superfamily. Four strands of antiparallel sheets and a layer of alpha helices create a cavity which was proposed to be the active site. This structure shows strong topological similarity to a polyketide monoxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor which functions in the actinorhodin biosynthesic pathway. It was suggested, therefore, that this fold is well suited to serve as a framework for rearrangements and chemical modification of polyaromatic substrates.

Classification The main outside influence on all of these except on Korandje is the Tamasheq language cluster. Korandje appears to be influenced more by Northern and Western Berber; in turn, the neighboring Northern Berber language Taznatit shows a few traces of Songhay influence.

It is the third sports network to be devoted to a specific collegiate athletic conference (after the Big Ten Network and the now-defunct MountainWest Sports Network) and the first to be owned by a conference outright without support from outside companies (Fox Entertainment Group owns 49% of Big Ten Network, while the defunct MountainWest Sports Network had CBS and Comcast as partners, and SEC Network and ACC Network are wholly owned by ESPN). The networks feature 24-hour coverage of Pac-12 sanctioned sporting events, including olympic sports as well as broadcasts of archived sports telecasts. The contract ensures that every football and men's basketball game is televised nationally. Sports not featured on the national Pac-12 Network are instead carried through the regional networks as well as on the Pac-12 Digital Network, which was launched the same day. On June 10, 2012, the Pac-12 Conference announced a partnership with pay-per-view service In Demand and Comcast Media Center (CMC) that would provide the networks with technical support, video on demand services, and support for TV Everywhere services. The infrastructure of the Pac-12 Networks, 12 member institutions and CMC's operations in Denver, Colorado are connected via fiber network. Master control origination services, including compression and satellite front-haul services, satellite receiver authorizations, and disaster recovery are also run through the CMC in Denver. The following month on July 22, the Pac-12 Conference announced an additional partnership with In Demand that would provide mobile production facilities and below-the-line crews for all 12 schools in the conference. Programming The Pac-12 Networks produce telecasts of roughly 850 collegiate events each year (350 events on Pac-12's national network, and 500 events carried on Pac-12 regional networks). The national network includes 35 football games, 100 men's basketball games and 40 women's basketball games on an annual basis. The Pac-12 national network also features all spring football games, coaches shows, and news conferences. The Pac-12 network has also shown rugby matches played by schools from the PAC Rugby Conference, even though college rugby is not a sport sanctioned by the NCAA.Rugby Mag, Mainstream Broadcast for Cal v UCLA, Feb. 19, 2014 Original programs broadcast by the networks include: * Pac-12 Sports Report - A weekly studio show discussing and highlighting the Pac-12 events of the week * Inside Pac-12 Football - A weekly studio show breaking down the latest football news from around the Pac-12 * The Drive - A weekly docu-series that provides a behind-the-scenes look inside Pac-12 football and men's basketball programs with exclusive content and audio from players and staff * Pac-12 Classics - A replay of classic Pac-12 games and events which includes commentary from the players and coaches involved * Pac-12 Encore - A replay of recent Pac-12 games or events * Pac-12 Playbook - A weekly football coaches show (No longer airing as of 2013) * The 12 Best - A series that counts down the top 12 conference sports moments within various categories * Varsity Days - A program featuring rare or never-before-seen footage of Pac-12 athletes and coaches, recapping historic moments and unforgettable battles * Timelines - A 12-installment series chronicling the great sports moments from the previous year for each Pac-12 school * Conference of Champions - A non-sports program that profiles current students in various features exploring how the university and educational experience fuels personal aspirations and future career endeavors. Presidents, chancellors, and professors supply additional context, providing viewers a unique and poignant look at the rich history, culture, and traditions of each Pac-12 university. Carriage The original announcement of the Pac-12 Networks' launch on July 27, 2011 included the announcement of carriage agreements with four major cable providers, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Bright House Networks to carry the Pac-12 Network and Pac-12 Digital Network at launch. The agreements did not guarantee that the Pac-12 Networks would be available in all areas within the territory of a Pac-12 university, and a minimum of 40 million homes nationally at launch date. The agreements complemented a 12-year deal that the Pac-12 Conference had struck with Fox Sports and ESPN that began in 2012. In addition, the network entered into extended negotiations with satellite providers. Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott stated in a May 8, 2012 interview with sports radio station KJR in Seattle that he is \\"quietly optimistic\\" that deals with providers would be made in time for the channel's planned fall 2012 launch. As of September 7, 2013, the Pac-12 Network has not yet signed carriage deals with DirecTV, Charter Communications and Verizon FiOS. On July 20, 2012, the Pac-12 Conference announced a long-term agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), a cooperative of 900 mostly smaller and rural cable providers, allowing any member of the NCTC access to carry one or more of the Pac-12 Network as well as providing access to the Pac-12 Digital Network through the NCTC WTVE TV Everywhere platform. In an August 10, 2012 conference, the conference announced that NCTC members Strata Networks and All West Communications in Utah, San Bruno Cable in the San Francisco Bay Area, GCI in Alaska, LocalTel Communications in Wenatchee, WA and Ashland Communications in Oregon had agreed to carry the Pac-12 Network. On July 28, 2012, Frontier Communications announced on one of its official Facebook accounts that the company would carry the channel on Frontier FiOS TV. The deal was officially announced on August 1, 2012. Several smaller providers reached carriage agreements with the network during the month of August 2012. On August 1, Oregon-based cable providers BendBroadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Network as well as the Pac-12 Digital Network on their \\"bendbroadband2go\\" TV Everywhere platform. Two days later on August 3, 2012, Arizona-based Western Broadband and Orbitel Communications announced their intent to carry the Pac-12 Arizona Network. On August 6, Astound Broadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Bay Area Network. A day later on August 7, Wave Broadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Bay Area, Oregon, and Washington Networks. On August 8, 2012, CC Communications announced its intent to carry the Pac-12 National Network and one Pac-12 regional channel (on August 30, 2012, CC Communications began carrying the Pac-12 Mountain network, in addition to the national network). Click! Network also revealed on their official Facebook page that it would carry the Pac-12 Network. On August 21, 2012, Canby Telecom announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 National Network as well as all Pac-12 regional networks. On September 8, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would carry the Pac-12 National Network starting on September 8. To date, it is the only satellite carrier to have struck a carriage agreement with the Pac-12 Networks, and was the largest pay television provider to reach a carriage deal during 2012, bringing the Pac-12 Networks' national coverage to approximately 60 million households. On February 1, 2016, however, Pac-12 restricted access to the regional channels for DISH subscribers. On October 10, 2012, the conference came to an agreement with Consolidated Communications for its SureWest Communications system in Northern California to carry the Pac-12 Networks Bay Area regional service. On September 6, 2013, Pac-12 Networks entered into a deal with AT&T; U-verse to carry the main feed on channel 759 (as well as on channel 760 in the San Francisco Bay Area, and on channel 761 in Los Angeles). As of 2015, the Pac-12 Networks were \\"available in\\" 90 million homes, but about 12 million actually subscribed to the network, according to SNL Kagan. On February 10, 2016, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on behalf of Jessop & Proulx LLP, added Pac-12 Network to its list of foreign broadcasters that are allowed to be carried by Canadian pay television providers. By the end of 2016, Pac-12 Network had carriage deals with Charter Communications in Los Angeles and Dallas, Frontier FiOS, and streaming service Sling TV, but still had not come to terms with DirecTV. In August 2017, the Pac-12 Networks were added to FuboTV. On November 28, 2018, it was reported that the Pac-12 Networks will no longer be available on AT&T; U-verse as of December 2, 2018. Approximately 19 million homes were subscribed to the network in 2018, according to SNL Kagan. In March 2019, Pac-12 Network announced partnerships with the Seven Network's 7plus streaming service in Australia, and DAZN in Canada, to carry programming from the service. As of August 2019, agreement with DirecTV still had not been reached. Pac-12 Networks president Mark Shuken stated ‚ÄúOur presidents, our athletic directors, when we talk, we talk about skating to where the puck‚Äôs going, not where it‚Äôs been\\" referring to the decline of satellite TV and the rise of streaming services.

The Slovak mafia does not have significant international presence and, even in Slovakia, their activities are limited by boundaries set by the powerful Russian mafia, Ukrainian mafia and Chechen mafia and various Balkan groups controlling much of the heroin trade. The Slovak mafia is especially active in security business, construction and ownership of restaurants and nightclubs. According to the United States Department of Defense \\"both indigenous and foreign organized crime groups are well established in Slovakia\\". Under Slovak law, the creation or support of an organized crime group constitutes a crime. In its modern form, the mafia is a young phenomenon in Slovakia, having truly emerged only after the end of communism in 1989. According to known Slovak sociologist Pavol Haulik from the MVK poll agency, \\"We can state that people imagine that the mafia has a very strong influence in Slovakia\\". In 2005 a list of mafia members, families and 'special interest groups' suspected by the Slovak police leaked to the public, complete with lists of registered weapons and vehicles followed by two leaks of updated lists in 2011.  History  In 1989, Czechoslovakia overthrew communism, and in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic separated. In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of organized crime was underrated and legislature concerning the fight against it was inadequate.is.muni.cz/th/170012/pravf_m/DIPLOMKA_TEXT.doc, page 8 Crime rates in Slovakia soared in the 1990s, and the first post-communist gangsters emerged. At the time of the 1994-1998 Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar's government, organized crime became well established in the country and it penetrated the highest political positions. An often cited example is the Slovak Secret Service under Ivan Lexa and his deputy Jaroslav Svƒõchota.  Description  The areas traditionally under mafia control in Slovakia include the biggest cities (Bratislava, Bansk√° Bystrica, Ko≈°ice) and southern Slovakia. According to former Chief investigator Jaroslav Ivor, organized crime is more prevalent in areas with good economic background. Southern Slovakia is also close to the Slovak-Hungarian border which provides a safety mechanism. Traditional ties to the community in a given region are also important. According to an anonymous investigator cited in Pravda (13.07.11, page 4), the political party which gets the Ministry of Interior for the election term gets to give out orders which mafia groups are to be let alone, and which groups will be put under pressure. According to the source it is possible to ascertain in each given time-frame which groups are avoided by the police and which groups are actively targeted by police raids and arrested. Besides the common overlap between policemen and organized crime associates, Slovak media routinely report on higher-ranking police officers having ties to the organized crime.  Mafia list leaks  There have been three distinct mafia lists leaked to the public so far. All of them were authored by the Slovak police.  First mafia list  The first mafia list appeared on the internet in 2005. Despite the name, it consists of several lists: the first contains names divided into several organized crime groups including dates of birth, addresses, gun license numbers and types of weapons. The second contains the names of \\"people of interest\\" including birth numbers (), addresses and sometimes with a photograph. The third contains \\"vehicles of interest\\" including evidence numbers and the name of the driver or owner. The fourth contains bars or restaurants either owned or frequented by the mafia. It divides the Slovak mafia into the following groups: Tak√°ƒçovci, Pi≈•ovci, Borb√©lyovci and Jak≈°√≠kovci. For a long time, the Slovak police refused to acknowledge its truthfulness and it wasn't until January 2011 that police Chief Jaroslav Spi≈°iak admitted that the mafia list was his idea to better fight against organized crime. \\"They were supposed to serve as an aid for patrolling policemen, so that they know who they are dealing with when conducting controls, to anticipate that they are dangerous\\", said Spi≈°iak at that time. It was immediately noted that numerous important figures of the Slovak mafia are missing from the list. Also, there are several mistakes present such as a member of the Tak√°ƒçovci group being listed instead under Jak≈°√≠kovci.  Second mafia list  The second mafia list, made in March 2010, was leaked to the Slovak media in September 2011. It contains 10 pages with the names of organized crime groups, names of members, birth numbers and addresses. It divides the Slovak mafia into the following groups: Pi≈•ovci, Jak≈°√≠kovci, Tak√°ƒçovci, vlamaƒçi,burglars autiƒçk√°ri,\\"car-men\\" defekt√°ri.\\"flat-tire men\\"  Third mafia list  The third mafia list is the most detailed list so far, containing over 400 names and including also the photographs of all suspected mafia members. The list consists of names, addresses, birth numbers, used weapons, registered vehicles, employment information and telephone contacts. It divides the Slovak mafia into the following groups: bytov√° mafia (apartment mafia), Pi≈•ovci, Tak√°ƒçovci, S√Ωkorovci, two distinct fractions of Jak≈°√≠kovci and group around J√°n Z. The third mafia list was leaked by a policewoman working at the Office of Combating Organized Crime (√örad boja proti organizovanej kriminalite) who downloaded it on her USB flash drive and later into the notebook of another person. She would fail a polygraph test and later confessed to the deed. On October 10, 2011, she was charged with abusing her powers. Hungaro-Slovak Mafia Arguably, the most powerful domestic type of organized crime in Slovakia are the criminal clans that emerged from the impoverished Hungarian communities in the south of the country . The local Hungarian Mafia has been active at least since the fall of communism in 1989, although their full timeline is unverified . Their main activities include trafficking and smuggling of narcotics, mainly heroin, people smuggling, extortion schemes involving kidnappings, contract killing, fraud & more. They have connections with groups tied to the Russian mafia, in Slovakia and internationally. In contrast to the more limited activities of the Slovak gangs in major cities of the country, the Hungarian criminal clans in the south of Slovakia are regarded to be exceptionally violent. The brutality of these clans reached its pinnacle in 1999, when crime lord Tibor P√°pay was gunned down along with his henchmen. This moment is regarded as the most disturbing gang massacre in the history of Slovakia.  Notable groups  * Jak≈°√≠kovci - a family named after brothers Ivan and Libor Jak≈°√≠k, who worked with the police in the 1990s and later owned a chain of bars. Ivan Jak≈°√≠k had a company (LIKO) with Ivan Pokorn√Ω and lawyer Martin Bogn√°r. Bogn√°r was previously accused of creating contracts about protection with security companies attached to the Tak√°ƒçovci family, an important part of the restaurant and bar racket. Both he and members of the Tak√°ƒçovci group were released when the prosecutor unexpectedly dismissed the charges. They had legal troubles in May 2011 when Slovak police arrested 8 members on various charges. * Pi≈•ovci - a family based in Lamaƒç, Bratislava is named after Juraj Ondrejƒç√°k aka Pi≈•o who is still boss. They make extensive use of Mercedes G vehicles. Their roster includes known Slovak businessman Mari√°n Koƒçner. * S√Ωkorovci - a family based in Bratislava, named after Miroslav S√Ωkora. On the first mafia list, the family is named Borb√©lyovci. In February 2009, the police arrested 10 members of the group, capo Martin B. narrowly escaped. * Tak√°ƒçovci - a family founded at the beginning of the 1990s by J√°n Tak√°ƒç. As of 2011 their roster includes the Greco-Roman wrestling trainer Karol L., former wrestler M√°rio R., karatist Sl√°vo B., and ice hockey player Richard M. * ƒåern√°kovci - a family founded in Bansk√° Bystrica, named after Mikul√°≈° ƒåern√°k. He was considered as the boss of all bosses after a war in Slovak underworld in 1997. * J√°n Z. group  See also  * Crime in Slovakia  References   Sources  * Pravda, 13.07.2011, No. 161, page 4, \\"Analysis: Whom helps the police\\" Category:Mafia Category:Organized crime by ethnic or national origin Category:Organized crime groups in Slovakia ","title":"Slovak mafia"},{"id":"32561046","text":"Humburi Senni, or Central Songhay, is a variety of Southern Songhai spoken in the Hombori region, straddling the Burkina‚ÄìMali border.

The series takes place inside a world in which everything is made of paper cutouts, clay, and other craft materials. It is presented by a live-action human host who lives in a yellow house inhabited by anthropomorphic everyday objects. Steve Burns hosted the series from its debut in 1996 until 2002, when the part was taken over by Donovan Patton. The program features an ensemble cast of animated characters who interact with the host. Co-creator Traci Paige Johnson voices the title character, a dog named Blue who communicates through distinctive barks. The series' composers Michael Rubin and Nick Balaban voiced Mailbox and Mr. Salt, respectively. In addition to the main characters, the show included various newly-introduced recurring characters and guest stars throughout its run. Some guests appeared as live- action companions of the host, while others voiced an animated cameo role. When a spin-off series titled Blue's Room premiered in 2004, a group of puppet characters were introduced as new friends of Blue. A reboot titled Blue's Clues & You! premiered in 2019, with Joshua Dela Cruz as the new host. Main characters Blue Blue is a playful and energetic 5-year- oldhttp://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/ femalemeet the characters on blue's clues. Nick Jr.. Last accessed 23 Feb 2012. puppy with light blue fur, wiggly toes, ticklish feet, and dark blue spots. She cannot talk but communicates with her owners, Steve, Joe, and Josh, through barks that they interpret based on her tone and expression. In each episode, she plays a game called Blue's Clues, in which she leaves three blue paw print clues for the host and viewers to find in order to answer a question. She has the ability to enter storybooks and picture frames by \\"skidooing\\" into them with a special dance routine. In the sixth season, she is granted a magic playroom called Blue's Room in which she can interact with the viewer and a cast of live-action puppet characters. In most animated appearances, she is voiced by Traci Paige Johnson, one of the series' creators. Johnson was cast as the character's voice because out of the crew, she was able to sound the most like a dog. In Blue's Room, she is voiced by Victoria Pontecorvo and puppeteered by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph. Blue is playful and she loves making brand new friends to play with and also is a loyal puppy who communicates with all of her friends. Steve Steve Burns plays a fictitious version of himself and is the host for the show's first four seasons. He is Blue's owner and caregiver. He wears a distinctive green- striped long-sleeve polo shirt with khakis and brown shoes. He loves anything that has a similar pattern. He‚Äôs intelligent, energetic, friendly, clever, helpful and sympathetic but sometimes clumsy, wild, impulsive, and forgetful. Steve and Blue are best friends. He‚Äôs always excited and prepared to play Blue's Clues, but can almost never find clues himself and relies on the viewer to help locate them. Whenever he finds a clue, he draws it in a pocket-sized pad of paper called the Handy Dandy Notebook. When he finishes a game of Blue's Clues, he sits in a giant red armchair called the Thinking Chair and comes up with possible solutions to Blue's puzzles. Within the first two seasons (some in the second), he would give out wrong and silly answers which usually upsets Blue, even in \\"Blue's Big Musical\\", \\"Blue's Big Costume Party\\", and \\"Blocks\\". His favorite time of the day is mail time when he receives a letter from Mailbox. He owns a stuffed anteater named Horace, which indicates that anteaters are also his favorite animal. At the end of the fourth season, Steve leaves for college on a hopscotch scholarship and leaves his younger brother, Joe, to take care of his house and Blue. There, he becomes the varsity captain for the hopscotch team at his college as revealed in the 100th episode special. In the reboot series Blue's Clues & You!, Steve has since graduated and now runs the Blueprints Detective Agency and appears as a recurring character. Joe Joe is the replacement host for the show's last two seasons. He is Steve's younger, taller brother who stays at the Blue's Clues house after Steve leaves for college. He wears a variety of different colored shirts with a horizontal line of squares on the front. In each of Joe's episodes, he alternates between colors (red, yellow, green, orange, purple, and blue). His favorite toy is a stuffed duck named Boris. He owns a Handy Dandy Notebook similar to Steve's, but it is larger and shaped like the Thinking Chair. In later episodes of Season 5 & 6, Joe normally does not draw clues in his notebook and instead watches magically-animated versions of the clues appear. Although sometimes silly and younger than Steve, he seems to be more mature and straight-talking as he never gave out wrong answers during thinking time thanks to Steve's advice. In the reboot series Blue's Clues & You!, Joe now runs the Present Store and appears as a recurring character. He is played by Donovan Patton. Josh Joshua Dela Cruz, like Burns, plays a fictitious version of himself and is the host of the reboot series Blue's Clues & You! and the current host of the franchise. He is Steve and Joe's younger cousin and a talented singer. Josh's double-sided Handy Dandy Notebook has a phone on the other side, which he uses to communicate with the other characters. Mailbox Mailbox is a cheerful purple mailbox who lives at the foot of the pathway in front of the Blue's Clues house. In each episode, Mailbox delivers a letter or informing an incoming e-mail after the host sings a special song called \\"Mailtime\\" and sits on the Thinking Chair. His letters contain video messages from children around the world that relate to the episode's topic. Mailbox has a thick Brooklyn accent and likes to crack jokes. He wants to be a comedian when he grows up and has a collection of postage stamps. Although he is normally stationed on a stake in the ground, he can use an \\"extendo\\" arm to move anywhere around the house or the backyard.

She usually has Steve's telephone on top of her and holds an assortment of useful items in her drawer, depending on the situation. She is a talented singer and enjoys performing on stage. However, she is shy and sometimes lets her lack of confidence prevent her from singing in front of others. She has been known to be sad whenever someone doesn't say \\"please\\", as proven in the episode \\"Blue's Sad Day\\". Sidetable likes all kinds of music.

It takes its name from the fact that it runs through the southern Solling in Lower Saxony, an area of large forests and low mountains (Mittelgebirge). It is listed as timetable (KBS) route 356 north (until 1992 it was KBS 245, and until 1970 it was KBS 200). Route Class 614 in H√∂xter-Ottbergen Section near Bad Karlshafen Solling Railway below the Hanover Cliffs Uslar station is now a cultural centre The line begins in the North Rhine-Westphalian district of H√∂xter, near Ottbergen and runs on a high embankment including a bridge over the Nethe to Amelunxen. It runs through a deep cutting to Wehrden station and then crosses the Weser river on a steel bridge and enters Lower Saxony and the district of Holzminden. The line follows the Weser upstream, passing through Lauenf√∂rde- Beverungen station and at W√ºrgassen returns to the district of H√∂xter. After W√ºrgassen it runs on a picturesque route between the Weser and the \\"Hanover cliffs\\" to the North Rhine-Westphalia‚ÄìHesse state border on the eastern outskirts of Bad Karlshafen, the northernmost city in the state, which is in the Kassel district, and on to Bad Karlshafen. Shortly after Bad Karlshafen the line runs through the Lower Saxony district of Northeim. The Wahmbeck tunnel cuts through a loop of the Weser. After Bodenfelde station the line finally leaves the Weser valley and then runs through the Schw√ºlme valley. Just after Bodenfelde station, the Solling Railway and the G√∂ttingen‚ÄìBodenfelde line separate and run parallel to Vernawahlshausen station, crossing the Hesse/Lower Saxony border three times (twice while crossing the Schw√ºlme). Until 1976 it was possible to change between the lines in Vernawahlshausen, but now only trains on the line to/from G√∂ttingen stop there. From there the line runs until the end of the line in the district of Northeim. In Gut Steimke, before Uslar, it crosses the Ahle river on a high viaduct. From Uslar-Allershausen until after Uslar-Bollensen the line again runs on a high embankment. The Solling line climbs along the southern slope of the Rehbach valley through Uslar and Volpriehausen stations to Ertingh√§usen (Bollert) tunnel, the highest point of the track (259 m above sea level), with gradients of up to 1.14%, and then runs down the Leine valley passing through Hardegsen on a gradient of up to 1.27%. In Hardegsen it passes through another deep cutting. After Berwartshausen the Solling line crosses the A 7 autobahn, running between Hanover and Kassel. Before Northeim it runs on an embankment and crosses the Leine river, the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed line and the North‚ÄìSouth railway (Hanoverian Southern Railway). In Northeim, it ends at the 63.951 km mark. Former branches  The former Holzminden‚ÄìScherfede mainline railway (which had been built by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company to connect the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway and the Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen railway) was crossed in Wehrden. Both lines ran parallel through Wehrden station, where changing trains was possible. After World War II, a 1.1 kilometre long rail link was built to the Holzminden‚ÄìScherfede line, connecting Ottbergen and Holzminden between Wildberg bei Amelunxen (a suburb of Beverungen) junction and Steinberg junction. Already during the war, the German military feared that three bridges near H√∂xter, F√ºrstenberg and Meinbrexen would be targets of air attacks, and in 1944 it began the construction of this rail link (since the F√ºrstenberg bridge made the easiest crossing of the three over the Weser to maintain), which however could not be completed. These bridges were, however, by blown up German troops on 7 April 1945 during their retreat. As it was the easiest bridge to rebuild, British engineers reopened the F√ºrstenberg Bridge on 1 September 1946 for double-track operations and in parallel also completed the rail link. Since the track is essentially a big curve, it was called the Engl√§nderkurve (English curve). It was closed on 11 December 1964 and subsequently dismantled. The Weser river bridges at H√∂xter and Wehrden were reopened on 13 December 1948. The bridge at Wehrden for the Solling railway was rebuilt with only one track and further repairs were subsequently carried out several times. At Bad Karlshafen there was a second station on the left side of the Weser on Carl's Railway (Carlbahn) to H√ºmme, who was not connected to the Solling Railway. The station at the Solling was therefore called Karlshafen r.U. (r.U. for rechtes Ufer, right bank), while the station on Carl's Railway was called Karlshafen l.U. (l.U. for linkes Ufer, left bank). The closed Uslar‚ÄìSch√∂nhagen (Han) railway (line number 1802; 1921/1927‚Äì1989/1990) branched off at Uslar. History  The Prussian state railways commenced construction of the line on 11 November 1873, the Ertinghausen tunnel, its highest point, was pierced on 6 September 1876, and its official opening took place on 15 January 1878. In 1886 the line was duplicated. This line was a very important route in the rail network of the German Empire, as it was a section of railway link between the industrial areas of Halle‚ÄìLeipzig and the Ruhr. The construction of the railway line through it and the resulting connection with the industrial centres of eastern and western Germany, stimulated economic growth. Together with the adjoining Altenbeken-Ottbergen-Kreiensen line to the west and the South Harz Railway (S√ºdharzbahn) to the east adjoining it became in the period between 1930 and 1945 one of the busiest for east-west freight traffic (during the Second World War more than 100 freight trains ran on the line). The division of Germany reduced the importance of the line, although freight traffic continued as far as Walkenried on the edge of the German Democratic Republic. Freight traffic was discontinued in 1989. After German reunification east-west traffic was concentrated on the routes through Hanover and Kassel, so this route has since only had regional importance. Beginning in early 1990 one track of the line has been dismantled. Crossings loops now only remain in Lauenf√∂rde, Bodenfelde, Uslar and Hardegsen. Since 2000, total closure of the line has been threatened several times, although in 2002 freight traffic was temporarily resumed on a small scale. Meanwhile, the railway has been connected to the electronic interlocking in G√∂ttingen to enable operation with little manpower. Current operations Interchange at H√∂xter-Ottbergen station Since 9 December 2007, there has been a service every two hours between Ottbergen and G√∂ttingen, which connects to Northeim in Bodenfelde. There are also additional services for school students. Public transport fares between Ottbergen and Bad Karlshafen are set by Nahverkehrsverbund Paderborn- H√∂xter (Regional transport association of Paderborn-H√∂xter). To the east from Lauenf√∂rde-Beverungen, fares are set by Verkehrsverbundes S√ºd-Niedersachsen (transport association of southern Lower Saxony). The connection from Ottbergen to G√∂ttingen, which runs as fas as Bodenfelde on this line, is also called the Oberweserbahn (Upper Weser Railway); it continues over the G√∂ttingen‚ÄìBodenfelde railway. The line is currently operated with class 648 diesel multiple units.

Matayoshi was the mayor of Hawaii County from 1974 to 1984. He was the third Mayor of Hawaii County, as well as its second elected Mayor overall. Matayoshi was also the longest-serving mayor of Hawaii County to date, holding the office for ten years. Biography Early life Matayoshi was born on November 21, 1928, in Hilo, on the Big Island of Hawaii. He graduated from Hilo High School in 1946. Matayoshi received in bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1950. He then pursued graduate studies at Temple University in Philadelphia, before completing his Master of Business Administration (MBA) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Matayoshi worked as a stockbroker by profession. Political career He was elected to the Hawaii County Board of Supervisors, the predecessor of what would become the Hawaii County Council, in 1962. Matayoshi was elected to the newly created Hawaii County Council in 1968, which he held until becoming Mayor in 1974. Mayor of Hawaii In May 1974, Hawaii County's first Mayor Shunichi Kimura resigned following appointment to the 3rd Circuit Court. Kimura's managing director, Bruce McCall, became Mayor following Kimura's resignation until a special election could be held. Herbert Matayoshi, a county councilman at the time, won a special election held a few months later to complete the remainder of the term. Matayoshi opposed allowing a large number of telescopes at the Mauna Kea Observatory on the summit of Mauna Kea. He also fought the construction of the Prince Kuhio Plaza during the 1970s and 1980s, arguing that the shopping mall would siphon away business from stores in downtown Hilo. Matayoshi dealt with controversy over the expansion of Hilo International Airport during his tenure. The expansion of Hilo's runways expanded the airport to the edge of a Hawaiian Homelands settlement, leading to protests from Native Hawaiian groups. He also mediated a dispute between residents and developers on the Kohala Coast, on the northeast portion if the Big Island. Residents and Native Hawaiian advocated had argued that the development to build resorts in the 1970s of Kohala threatened recreational activities enjoyed by locals. Matayoshi's managing director during portions of his tenure, Jack Keppeler, told the Honolulu Star Advertiser that Matayoshi sought policies to deliver services to island residents, such as fire and police protection, in a fiscally conservative manner. Another former Hawaii mayor, Lorraine Inouye, noted that Matayoshi's background in business obscured his commitment to environmental protection, in the eyes of some observers. Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie credited Matayoshi with implementing many of Hawaii County's major social service programs, including the Elderly Activities Division, championing small businesses and improving the island's infrastructure. Matayoshi resigned from the mayor's office in 1984, to pursue an unsuccessful candidacy for Hawaii Senate. He lost the state Senate election to Richard Matsuura. His managing director, Megumi Kon, was sworn in to succeed Matayoshi until Dante Carpenter was elected a few months after his resignation. Herbert Matayoshi died from heart failure at Straub Clinic & Hospital in Honolulu on July 11, 2011, at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife, Mary Y. Matayoshi; daughter, Kathryn; three sons ‚Äì Jerold, Ronald and Eric; his sister, Edith Harano; eleven grandchildren and one great grandchild. His daughter, Kathryn Matayoshi, is the superintendent of the Hawaii Department of Education. Another son, Ron Matayoshi, is the director of international programs at the University of Hawaii's School of Social Work. Herbert Matayoshi resided in homes in both Hilo and Kahala, a neighborhood in Honolulu. Governor Neil Abercrombie ordered all American and Hawaiian flags to be flown at half staff on August 15, 2011, in Matayoshi's honor.

The Demazure character formula, introduced by , gives the characters of Demazure modules, and is a generalization of the Weyl character formula. The dimension of a Demazure module is a polynomial in the highest weight, called a Demazure polynomial. Demazure modules Suppose that g is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, with a Borel subalgebra b containing a Cartan subalgebra h. An irreducible finite-dimensional representation V of g splits as a sum of eigenspaces of h, and the highest weight space is 1-dimensional and is an eigenspace of b. The Weyl group W acts on the weights of V, and the conjugates wŒª of the highest weight vector Œª under this action are the extremal weights, whose weight spaces are all 1-dimensional. A Demazure module is the b-submodule of V generated by the weight space of an extremal vector wŒª, so the Demazure submodules of V are parametrized by the Weyl group W. There are two extreme cases: if w is trivial the Demazure module is just 1-dimensional, and if w is the element of maximal length of W then the Demazure module is the whole of the irreducible representation V. Demazure modules can be defined in a similar way for highest weight representations of Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras, except that one now has 2 cases as one can consider the submodules generated by either the Borel subalgebra b or its opposite subalgebra. In the finite-dimensional these are exchanged by the longest element of the Weyl group, but this is no longer the case in infinite dimensions as there is no longest element. Demazure character formula History The Demazure character formula was introduced by . Victor Kac pointed out that Demazure's proof has a serious gap, as it depends on , which is false; see for Kac's counterexample. gave a proof of Demazure's character formula using the work on the geometry of Schubert varieties by and . gave a proof for sufficiently large dominant highest weight modules using Lie algebra techniques. proved a refined version of the Demazure character formula that conjectured (and proved in many cases).

The assault was carried out in a barracks, killing four soldiers while injuring another. Three were killed on the spot while the fourth died after being taken to the hospital. One of the fatalities was an officer while the rest were rank-and-file soldiers. The victims included the cousin of South Korean actor, Im Hyeok-pil. Related Parties *Perpetrator: Kim Minchan, Corporal (19) *Accomplice: Jung Joonhyeok (20) *Victims: Lee Sunghoon (25), Lee Seungryeol (20), Park Chihyeon (21), Kwon Seunghyeok (20) *Injured: Kwonhyeok (19) Issues The South Korean marine corps formed a task force to investigate the rampage. This came amid claims of sexual harassment, hazing, extortion in the hierarchies, and violence that are happening within the South Korean marine corps' barracks. The problems have been happening for years and they were blamed for the recurring shooting incidents. In June 2005, for instance, a young soldier threw a grenade and fired at his sleeping teammates in a guard post at Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province. The shooting, where eight soldiers died, was also linked to bullying behavior by senior officers. There are also claims that the tension with North Korea is taking its toll on the soldiers stationed near the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone. Like many marine stations on the country's front-line islands, Ganghwa is within striking distance of North Korea. A year before, one of such islands was attacked, leading to the death of four people, including two marines. Criticism Actor, Im Hyeok-pil criticized many of the South Korean politicians who evaded their conscription service for taking roles in resolving the shooting incident. Impact on policies The authorities of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps announced to execute a 100-day program to promote the healthy and safe military culture within the military barracks. There is also plan to discharge marines who perpetuated acts of violence and to transfer them to other bases. On January 13, 2012, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps General Military Court announced a ruling of the death penalty for Kim Minchan, and 20 years of imprisonment for Jung Joonhyeok, who had been arrested and indicted on suspicion of killing a higher officer. They appealed immediately after the ruling, and according to Article 406 of the Military Court Act, defendants cannot abandon an appeal in connection with rulings of the death penalty, and life imprisonment, however, \\"it is only that it is not possible to abandon an appeal within a fixed period of time,\\" not that an appeal is fulfilled automatically. On July 10, 2012, Ministry of National Defense High Military Court maintained the original ruling from the first hearing for Kim Minchan, the perpetrator who was arrested and indicted on suspicion of killing a higher officer, and the appeal was dismissed. However, the original ruling in connection with Jung Joonhyeok was overturned, and was decreased to 10 years of imprisonment. The second ruling was finalized by the Supreme Court on January 24, 2013.

The first record of them competing in national football was in 1996-97 Montserrat Championship, known as the Carib Football League for sponsorship reasons, under the name Ideal Boys. Only one result is recorded, a 4‚Äì3 victory over the Seventh Day Adventists Trendsetters, before the season was cancelled when the Soufri√®re Hills erupted causing widespread devastation to the island. The following season was cancelled as a result of the eruption, but Ideal Boys returned in 2000, finishing as runners up in the four team competition to winners Royal Montserrat Police Force, winning four and drawing one of their seven games (the final round apparently cancelled since no result could affect the final standings). The 2001 season was a repeat of 2000, with Ideal Boys again finishing in second place to the Royal Montserrat Police Force, this time in a five team league, winning five and drawing one of their matches. Changing their name firstly to Ideal Printers and then to Ideal SC, the club completed a hat-trick of second-place finishes, again finishing as runners up to the police team, this time on goal difference in a competition played as a single round-robin contest between the four competing clubs.

The area is important as a breeding site for waterbirds. Description The floodplains are seasonally flooded and contain several freshwater lakes which continue to hold water well after the floods have receded. Lakes Mipia and Koolivoo are inundated annually, with Mipia often retaining water until the following flood season, but Koolivoo usually dries up by early summer. Lake Machattie is flooded about once in three years. The three lakes are fresh when filled by floods but become increasingly saline as they dry out. The floodplains are characterised by anastomosing channels and waterholes lined with open coolibah woodland, surrounded by grasslands, forblands, samphire and lignum.

It also provides a consistent approach for applications running on-premises or in the cloud. Claims-based identity abstracts the individual elements of identity and access control into two parts: a notion of claims, and the concept of an issuer or an authority. Identity and claims A claim is a statement that one subject, such as a person or organization, makes about itself or another subject. For example, the statement can be about a name, group, buying preference, ethnicity, privilege, association or capability. The subject making the claim or claims is the provider. Claims are packaged into one or more tokens that are then issued by an issuer (provider), commonly known as a security token service (STS). The name \\"claims-based identity\\" can be confusing at first because it seems like a misnomer. Attaching the concept of claims to the concept of identity appears to be combining authentication (determination of identity) with authorization (what the identified subject may and may not do). However a closer examination reveals that this is not the case. Claims are not what the subject can and cannot do. They are what the subject is or is not. It is up to the application receiving the incoming claim to map the is/is not claims to the may/may not rules of the application. In traditional systems there is often confusion about the differences and similarities between what a user is/is not and what the user may/may not do. Claims-based identity makes that distinction clear. Security token service Once the distinction between what the user is/is not and what the user may/may not do is clarified, it is possible that the authentication of what the user is/is not (the claims) can be handled by a third party. This third party is called the security token service. To better understand the concept of security token service, consider the analogy of a night club with a doorman. The doorman wants to prevent under-age patrons from entry. To facilitate this he requests a patron to present a driver's license, health insurance card or other identification (the token) that has been issued by a trusted third party (the security token service) such as the provincial or state vehicle license department, health department or insurance company. The nightclub is thus alleviated of the responsibility of determining the patron's age. It only has to trust the issuing authority (and of course make its own judgment of the authenticity of the token presented). With these two steps completed the nightclub has successfully authenticated the patron with regard to the claim that he or she is of legal drinking age. Continuing the analogy, the nightclub may have a membership system, and certain members may be regular or VIP. The doorman might ask for another token, the membership card, which might make another claim; that the member is a VIP. In this case the trusted issuing authority of the token would probably be the club itself. If the membership card makes the claim that the patron is a VIP, then the club can react accordingly, translating the authenticated VIP membership claim to a permission such as the patron being permitted to sit in the exclusive lounge area and be served free drinks. Note that not all uses of the term \\"authentication\\" include claims acquisition. The only difference is that authentication is limited to the binding of the user to the information contained about the user in the target site as no attribute data (claim) is required to complete an authentication. As privacy concerns become more important, the ability of digital entities to authenticate users without access to personal attributes becomes increasingly important. Benefits Claims-based identity has the potential to simplify authentication logic for individual software applications, because those applications don't have to provide mechanisms for account creation, password creation, reset, and so on. Furthermore, claims-based identity enables applications to know certain things about the user, without having to interrogate the user to determine those facts. The facts, or claims, are transported in an \\"envelope\\" called a secure token. Claims-based identity can greatly simplify the authentication process because the user doesn't have to sign in multiple times to multiple applications. A single sign in creates the token which is then used to authenticate against multiple applications, or web sites. In addition, because certain facts (claims) are packaged with the token, the user does not have to tell each individual application those facts repeatedly, for instance by answering similar questions or completing similar forms.

Yates Federal Building, historically known as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and later the Auditor's Building Complex, is a large historic federal building located on the National Mall and built between 1878-1880 that has housed multiple federal government offices. It is an L-shaped building of red and black brick construction in the Romanesque style and was designed by the office of James G. Hill, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. () The brick was provided by the Peerless Brick Company of Philadelphia. The builder was John Fraser, Superintendent of Construction for the Treasury, and the bricklayers were Bitting & Davidson. The building was originally designed and constructed for the United States Department of the Treasury Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). The Bureau was founded in 1862 to allow the federal government to produce its own official documents; private companies having done so prior to this. The Bureau's machinery and offices were originally located in the Treasury Building, but eventually more space was required. In 1878, land was purchased from philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran and an Act of Congress on June 28 of that year authorized commencement of construction. The building was completed in 1880. Three additions were later constructed in 1891, 1895 and 1900. The Bureau moved to a larger building at 14th & C Streets in 1914. Following the Bureau's move, the building was used by a number of government agencies, but primarily housed auditors from the Departments of Navy, Treasury, and State, and became known as the \\"Auditors' Complex\\". Engravers from the BEP also later used space on the west of the building as it provided excellent natural light for their work. By the 1960s, the building had become underutilized and in need of major renovation. It was slated for demolition in 1966, but was postponed due to lack of funding. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1978 for its architectural and historical significance. The listing included three contributing buildings, named Annex #1-3, on . Following a repair and modernization campaign in 1985‚Äì1987, the USDA Forest Service moved into the building in 1990 and continues to occupy the building. In 1988, the 1891 addition known as the South Annex was demolished so that the adjacent United States Holocaust Memorial Museum could expand into the space. In 1999, it was redesignated the Sidney R. Yates Federal Building, honoring Illinois Congressman Sidney Richard Yates who helped establish the Holocaust Memorial Museum and served on its council. In 2017, a working clock was added to the tower. It had been a part of the original design, but was not installed due to excessive costs.

Sports agent Van Wagenen's began his agent career at IMG working for Casey Close and Mark McCormack. His first client was Randy Flores. At Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Van Wagenen was a Co-Head of CAA Sports' Baseball division. Van Wagenen has been noted by Forbes, and, in March 2012, Sports Business Journal named Van Wagenen to its \\"40 Under 40\\" list of \\"the best young talent in sports business.\\" For Yoenis C√©spedes, Van Wagenen negotiated a three-year, $75 million contract with the New York Mets that included an opt-out after the first season (2016). The $25 million average annual value of the deal matched the highest average annual value ever for an outfielder. Cespedes opted out of his contract after the 2016 season and in November 2016 re-signed for $110 million over four years, setting records for annual average value ($27.5 million) records for an outfielder and any Mets player in franchise history and the second-highest AAV ever for a non-pitcher. In sum, it guaranteed Cespedes $137.6 million over five years with the Mets. In December 2013, Van Wagenen negotiated a $240 million, 10-year contract for Robinson Can√≥ with the Seattle Mariners. The deal made Cano just the fifth player to sign a contract for $200 million or more with only Alex Rodriguez ever signing a contract worth more in guaranteed salary. Cano's contract more than doubled the previous record guarantee for a second baseman, was the largest contract ever for a player who had not had a 35-homer season and was just the fifth 10-year contract of the past decade. In 2016, Van Wagenen became the baseball agent for former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow as Tebow made the transition from football to baseball. Tebow signed with the Mets. He also represented the Mets' Jacob deGrom. Front office career In October 2018, Van Wagenen interviewed to replace Sandy Alderson as the New York Mets' General Manager. On October 29, the Mets announced the hiring of Van Wagenen as their general manager.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25122849/mets- throw-changeup-hire-agent-brodie-van-wagenen-gm Personal life Van Wagenen's wife, Molly (n√©e Knight; no relation to baseball journalist Molly Knight), is also a graduate and former diver at Stanford University.

It is a flammable liquid with an unpleasant, garlic-like odor. Occurrence Dimethyl disulfide is a widespread natural odoriferous compound emitted from many sources such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. It is an oxidation product of methanthiol in air. Along with dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl trisulfide it has been confirmed as volatile compounds given off by the fly-attracting plant known as dead-horse arum (Helicodiceros muscivorus). These flies are attracted to the odor of fetid meat, and thus help pollinate this plant. DMDS can be produced by the oxidation of methanethiol, e.g. with iodine: :2 CH3SH + I2 ‚Üí CH3SSCH3 \\\\+ 2 HI Chemical reactions Important reactions include chlorination giving methanesulfenyl chloride (CH3SCl), methanesulfinyl chloride (CH3S(O)Cl),Irwin B. Douglass and Richard V. Norton \\"Methanesulfinyl Chloride\\" Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.709-712 (1973). and methanesulfonyl chloride (CH3SO2Cl) as well as oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid giving the thiosulfinate methyl methanethiosulfinate (CH3S(O)SCH3). Uses DMDS is used as a food additive in onion, garlic, cheese, meats, soups, savory flavors, and fruit flavors., OSHA Industrially, DMDS is used in oil refineries as a sulfiding agent.Dimethyl Disulfide (DMDS) , Arkema, Inc. DMDS is also an effective soil fumigant in agriculture, registered in many states in the U.S. as well as globally. In this capacity, DMDS is an important alternative in replacing methyl bromide, which is being phased out, however less effective than the former. This pesticide is marketed as \\"Paladin\\" by Arkema. Food use DMDS is used to alpha substitute 2-methylfuran-acrolein to produce a food stuff used in concentrations from 0.02 ppm up to 50 ppm. Industrial use DMDS is a stable pale yellow liquid which works as an effective product for sulfiding hydroprocessing catalysts because of its high sulfur content and low decomposition temperature. Most refineries utilize DMDS instead of other sulfur spiking agents for catalyst sulfiding because it has more sulfur per pound than dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or di-tertiary-butyl polysulfide (TBPS).Dimethyl Disulfide (DMDS) Once injected to a hydrotreater or hydrocracker, DMDS decomposes to form H2S. The H2S reacts with the metal oxides on the catalyst, converting them to the active metal sulfide form. DMDS also works as an effective product for operators in the petrochemicals industry who must protect their steam-cracking coils against the formation of coke and carbon monoxide. DMDS is utilized in the preparation of 4-(methylthio)phenol which is used in the production of various pesticides. DMDS and chlorine are reacted with borontriflouride phenolate to produce 4-(methylthio)phenol. Thiophene and DMDS are blended with combustible hydrocarbon fuel gas to impart a gassy odor to the fuel gas.

He was the first person twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union during the war while alive. Early life Molodchy was born on 27 June 1920 in Luhansk to a large Ukrainian peasant family. After completing secondary school and training at the Voroshilovgrad aeroclub in 1935, he stayed at the aeroclub, where he worked at a workshop and as an instructor until entering the military as a junior lieutenant in 1937. When he was fifteen he won an aircraft modeling competition, and before becoming a member of the Communist Party in 1942 he was a member of the Komsomol. After graduating from initial training at the Voroshilovgrad Military Aviation School of Pilots in November 1938, he trained to fly the Tupolev SB until November 1939; he then became a pilot in the 51st High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment, and in 1940 he was transferred to the 100th Long- range Bomber Regiment. World War II When Germany began the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Molodchy was a deputy squadron commander in the 420th Long-Range Bomber Regiment. Before entering combat in August he became one of the first Soviet pilots to become proficient in flying the Yer-2; or flying six daylight and seven night missions on it he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 20 October 1941, which was awarded two days later. From January 1942 to June 1944 he was a deputy squadron commander in the 748th Long-Range Aviation Regiment, which received the guards designation in the August of the same year and was renamed 2nd Guards Regiment. After successfully bombing Berlin in an Il-4 on 26 August 1942 he received a congratulatory radiogram from Joseph Stalin. For most of his missions in the early years of the war he flew with Sergey Kulikov as his navigator. Molodchy was nominated for a second gold star on 2 October 1942 for flying 145 missions, both bombing and reconnaissance flights. The awarding of the title on 31 December 1942 made him the first non-posthumous double awardee during the conflict. He was nominated for a third gold star in November 1943, but it was not awarded; in 1944 he was again nominated for a third gold star, but awarded the Order of Lenin instead. In June 1944 Molodchy became a flight inspector for the 1st Guards Long-Range Aviation Division, so he did not fly any combat sorties from then until April 1945. While assigned as an inspector to the division he trained over 40 pilots. Once he was able to return to combat in April 1945, he flew four missions before the end of the war. Throughout the war he flew 311 sorties, consisting of 24 daylight and 287 night missions on the Yer-2, Il-4, and B-25 over strategically importance cities in Europe including Berlin, Stalingrad, Kursk, K√∂nigsberg, Budapest, Vitebsk, Minsk, Vilnius, Riga, Smolensk, Oryol, and Polotsk. Despite being shot down twice, he survived the war, and his flight crew shot down five Axis fighters. Postwar Molodchy remained as a flight inspector until September 1946 when he became the deputy commander of the 37th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment. He went on to attend to Higher Officer Flight and Tactical School of Long-Range Aviation in Ivanovo, which he graduated from in 1948 before returning to his post at the 37th Bomber Regiment. In March 1949 he was promoted to commander of the 121st Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment, where he remained until December 1950. He was then made the deputy commander of the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division, which he became commander of in December 1951, but was demoted to deputy commander in August 1953. In 1955 he was promoted to the rank major-general of aviation and made commander of the 106th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division. After graduating from the Military Academy of General Staff in November 1959 he was assigned to the 5th Long- Range Air Army, and in 1961 he took command of the 8th Separate Bomber Aviation Corps. In 1963 he made a flight to a polar icefield with a full load of bombs in a Myasishchev ZM. His military career began to decline after he sent a letter to Marshal Rodion Malinovsky expressing concern about the structure and organization of military long-range aviation. The letter was seen by Marshal Filipp Agaltsov, who already had a personal grudge against Molodchy; Agaltsov had become a marshal of aviation despite being a commissar and political worker, rather than a pilot. Shortly after storming out of a meeting with military officials in outrage, he was discharged into the reserve - supposedly for health reasons, even though he was only 44 years old at the time. After leaving the military in 1965, he briefly worked as a manager of a fuel trust in Lugansk, but his strong will led to him getting into squabbles with high-ranking politicians in the region. In 1968 he moved to Chernigov; his health deteriorated over time and he suffered multiple heart attacks, and he became depressed after his gold star medals were stolen. To cheer him up, a Tu-95 made low-altitude flight over his house on his 70th birthday. He died in Vinnitsa on 9 June 2002 and was buried in the Yatsevo cemetery.

It consists of a number of modules fitted to NATO standard Mk81, Mk82 or Mk83 low drag free-fall bombs to convert them into guided glide bombs. Design The modular kit consists of a number units that are attached to a standard Mk80-series bomb. A guidance system and large tail fins are the most basic form of the system, optional folding wings and a rocket motor may be added to increase the stand-off range up to or add a low-level launch capability. Range using different configurations: * Standard bomb kit - 40 km * With folding wing kit - 120 km * With wing kit and Extended Range (ER) module - 200 km Guidance The weapon's all-weather, day and night capability is due to the GPS‚ÄìINS guidance system. Increasing accuracy to a claimed 3m CEP is possible by adding an imaging infrared or a semi-active laser seeker terminal guidance system. Testing and qualification The system was first tested on the Atlas Cheetah, later an Aerosud-owned former South African Air Force (SAAF) Dassault Mirage F1 was used after the Cheetah retired. The system has been integrated on the SAAF's BAE Hawk Mk120 lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. Qualification on the SAAF's Saab JAS 39 Gripen was not considered due to the high costs associated with integration on a supersonic aircraft. The Gripens have been armed with GBU-12 Paveway II bombs instead. Sales The manufacturer has expressed optimism at the export potential of the system following qualification on the Hawk as a number of air forces worldwide operate Hawks. An unnamed country has placed an order worth ZAR1.2 billion for the weapon. Although the SAAF has funded most of the development costs of the weapon system it has not yet placed a firm order for any.

Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, who also co- starred in Kaminey in 2009, portray three couples from three different eras. In 1910 Sargodha, they are two star-crossed lovers during the British Raj; in 1960 Mumbai, a popular Bollywood actress and a struggling musician; and in 2012 London, two university students. Kohli conceived Teri Meri Kahaani from the idea of soulmates, showing the strength of love beyond generations by having the same two actors portray all three couples without using a reincarnation theme. He co-wrote the film with Robin Bhatt. Muneesh Sappel created three sets for depicting the different time periods, requiring months of research and detailed designs. Principal photography began in Mumbai in mid-2011 and later moved to London, where it was primarily shot at the Jublee Campus of the University of Nottingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. Sajid-Wajid composed the soundtrack with lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. The film was released on 22 June 2012 to mixed reviews to positive reviews from critics, receiving praise mostly for the performances of the lead pair and their chemistry, the music and the production design, especially the re-creation of 1960s Mumbai. Made on a budget of 300 million, the film grossed 540 million. Although it performed \\"averagely\\" at the domestic box office, it fared well in the overseas market. Plot In 1960, aspiring musician Govind (Shahid Kapoor) and popular Bollywood superstar Ruksar (Priyanka Chopra) meet on a train heading to Bombay, India. Ruksar had run away from her home Lucknow with her best friend to become a film star. The two bond over their careers but part ways after arriving in Bombay. Govind befriends Radhika (Prachi Desai), a confident and modern girl, who is charmed by his simplicity. Ruksar and Govind meet again and hit it off at a party, but Govind notices a photo journalist following them. He holds Radhika's hand to mislead the journalist, unaware that Radhika has fallen in love with him. Radhika is the best friend Ruksar had run away with, and the two tell each other about the man they've fallen in love with, not realising he is the same person. When Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways. In London in 2012, college students Krish and Radha meet after Krish breaks up with his girlfriend, Meera (Neha Sharma), on his birthday. After a misunderstanding between Krish and Radha is cleared, they become friends and spend time getting to know each other. When Meera learns that Krish is with Radha, she angrily uploads embarrassing photos of him to Facebook that go viral. Radha learns that Krish spent the night with her on his birthday only two hours after he broke up with Meera, but when she tries to talk to him, he is too busy retaliating against Meera. Frustrated and heartbroken, Radha leaves. The film rewinds to 1910 Sargodha during the times of the British Raj. Javed, a Punjabi Muslim womaniser with a talent for reciting poetry, meets Aradhana, a young woman in the village, while being chased by the police. They become acquainted, but Javed's flirty nature upsets Aradhana. Javed insists she is special and focuses all his attention on her. He joins Aradhana's father in a protest for freedom from the British, but when officers begin to physically abuse the protestors, Javed hides while Aradhana's father is beaten. Aradhana is disgusted with him. To appease her, Javed allows himself to be beaten and arrested in front of her. She visits him in jail and tells him their love cannot happen, but he asks her to wait. Three months later, Javed is freed, but he learns that Aradhana was married a month before. Aradhana tells Javed in tears that she only married to make her father happy. Soon after, Javed also must marry for his father's happiness. Aradhana comes to the wedding to see him one last time. During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana. To conclude, all three couples are revisited. In 1960, Govind packs up and boards a train, but is followed by Ruksar, and the two reconcile. In 2012, Krish speaks to Meera and Radha one more time, severing ties with Meera and confessing his true love to Radha. In 1910, Javed and Aradhana vow that their love will not only last this lifetime but for all lifetimes to come. Cast * Shahid Kapoor as Govind / Javed Qadri / Krish Kapoor * Priyanka Chopra as Ruksar / Aradhana / Radha Chopra * Prachi Desai as Radhika * Neha Sharma as Meera * Vrajesh Hirjee as Journalist * Shankar Sachdev as Javed's Father * Surendra Pal as Aradhana's Father * Raj Singh Arora as Rohan / Bharat * Aman Nagpal as Balwinder * Tarun Sharma as Cherag / Salim * Chand Mishra as Ruksar's Manager Production Development Director Kunal Kohli was fascinated with the idea of soulmates and conceived the film as a tale of \\"the strength of love beyond generations\\". The premise would be a love story with the same two actors in three different time period that did not involve reincarnation. He said, \\"It's the story of three different lives and proves that love is a promise forever. We have chosen one hundred years to talk about love. We didn't want it to be soppy or melodramatic.\\" Kohli co-wrote the screenplay with Robin Bhatt. He found it difficult to represent three time periods, but felt that the film could appeal to everyone if he chose to \\"keep some of it in the past and still make it youthful and modern.\\" He said, \\"I have created humour and situations which would be liked by everyone\\". For instance, he chose to display a different side to the Indian independence movement of the 1910s as opposed to the \\"unromantic and non-colourful\\" depiction. Kohli said \\"everyone takes a very serious approach to that part of the history,\\" so he instead used it to frame a love story between a Punjabi belle and a Casanova. 1960s Bollywood also fascinated Kohli, who wanted to pay tribute to Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Shammi Kapoor, and Dilip Kumar. However, rather than remaking films of the past, he \\"remade a whole era. It is much easy to remake a film, remaking an entire era is not a cakewalk; it is a very challenging task.\\" Through the final storyline of the film, set in 2012, Kohli wanted to demonstrate a modern romance, which mostly happens through SMS, instant messaging apps, and Internet chat. Kohli described it by saying, \\"Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses and you get that feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that person because that person is telling you everything that is happening in their life. You are constantly updating the other person with your thoughts and that is what keeps you connected to that person.\\" In February 2011, it was announced that Kohli would be producing the film with Eros International. Amitabh Shukla was chosen to edit the film while Sandeep Shirodkar was brought in to compose the background score. Casting In November 2010, Kohli announced that Shahid Kapoor would be starring in his untitled upcoming film and stated that he was looking to sign the leading actress in the next few days. In January 2011, Kohli confirmed Priyanka Chopra's casting on Twitter. This became the second film collaboration between the two actors after Kaminey (2009). Kohli said that he had always wanted to bring Kapoor and Chopra together for a \\"quintessential musical love story.\\" Kohli had approached Kapoor for a different film while the script of Teri Meri Kahaani was still in development. When Kapoor asked about working together on a different film, Kohli proposed the as yet unwritten love story. Kapoor was confused but interested, and after Kohli explained the concept, he agreed to the role. Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in the lead roles, making it their second film collaboration after Kaminey (2009). Kohli had been in discussions with Chopra for a different project before, which would have paired her with Saif Ali Khan. At that time, Khan and Chopra had been asked to star together in a number of films, including 2 States, Cocktail, Race 2 and Vishal Bhardwaj's Dreams. Siddharth Anand's adaptation of 2 States would film at the same time as Kohli's proposed film. Anand and Kohli met and agreed that Chopra would act in 2 States. Later, Kohli approached Chopra with a new script, and she agreed to join the cast for Teri Meri Kahaani. Prachi Desai and Neha Sharma were cast to play Kapoor's love interests in the 1960s and 2012, respectively. Kapoor said that of the three characters he plays‚ÄîJaved the poet, Govind the struggling musician and Krish the college student‚ÄîKrish is the closest to himself, but Javed was the most interesting, a type of character he had never played before. Javed uses shayari, a type of poetry, to flirt. \\"Shayaris are his pickup lines and very often he does succeed to getting the girls,\\" said Kapoor. \\"He is not a sophisticated shayar and that is part of his charm.\\" He also called Javed \\"the funniest and naughtiest character of 1910 I have ever seen.\\" Despite the role being his favourite, Kapoor faced problems with the era-appropriate costume, which required him to wear traditional mojari shoes and clip-on stud earrings; he suffered from both shoe bites and red ears during filming. Chopra faced the challenge of her triple roles by playing each one as differently as possible. She used the script to identify unique characteristics of each‚ÄîAradhana is a Punjabi girl, Ruksar speaks with the manners of a popular Bollywood actress from Lucknow, and Radha displays a contemporary confidence. Of the three, Chopra found playing a girl from 1910 to be the toughest. She said, \\"There was no reference point for it except some books,\\" and the few sketches Kohli was able to provide for costume design. Even with only written sources, she worked toward developing an accent that would have been typical for a Punjabi girl from Pakistan. In contrast, Chopra was able to consult Saira Banu, a leading Hindi film actress of the 1960s, to understand the way her character Ruksar lived. Like Kapoor, Chopra enjoyed the novelty of playing a character in 1910, \\"a certain period which normally [she] would not get to play,\\" and she related best to her contemporary character Radha. But for her Ruksar was the most interesting. \\"I got to play a superstar actress of the 1960s,\\" she said. \\"I got to wear the glamorous clothes of those days, don big hair-dos and speak the way actresses spoke then. I loved all those things.\\" Manish Malhotra and Kunal Rawal designed the costumes for Chopra and Kapoor respectively. Malhotra also consulted Asha Parekh, who gave several insights into the life of actresses in her day, to design Chopra's costumes and look to play Ruksar. Filming Muneesh Sappel handled the art direction while Sunil Patel did the cinematography. Sappel created three sets depicting the 1910, 1960s and 2012 settings for the three storylines. He did extensive research for six months, visiting each location in person to ensure that the sets looked authentic and real, and using visual effects (VFX) to complete the designs. Jubilee Campus at the University of Nottingham, where the 2012 story was shot The 1910 portion, which is set in Sargodha, Punjab, during the British Empire, was easy to recreate with \\"a temple, mosque, market, a small village, brick houses etc.\\" Initially, the crew wanted to use an actual village as the set, but were unable to find one that had not changed in the past century. Instead, they chose to construct a set that would be historically accurate. Sappel said that the set for 1960s Mumbai was much more time-consuming, with \\"trams, chawl, guest houses, old studios and old cinema houses\\" to create the intended atmosphere. Principal photography started in Mumbai in late May 2011. The first stage of shooting was completed in early July 2011. Filming resumed at the end of the month, and continued until mid-August 2011. Initially, the London scenes were to be shot in September after the release of Mausam (2011), another film starring Kapoor. However, the release date was postponed one week to 16 September, causing the pre-release promotions to conflict with the existing shooting schedule. Chopra was scheduled to film Barfi! (2012) in July, but director Anurag Basu agreed to move filming to September so that Kohli could film with both Chopra and Kapoor in July. The London portion, where Kapoor and Chopra portray two college students, was filmed at the University of Nottingham's Jubilee Campus and the Stratford-upon-Avon. Filming ended in January 2012 with a four-day long song shoot in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was composed by Sajid-Wajid, with lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi. The album consists of five original songs and two remixes. The vocals were performed by Wajid, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Mika Singh, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam, Sunidhi Chauhan and Shaan. It was released on 6 June 2012 by T-Series. The soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. Noting it as a \\"a very good success, especially so since it has melody at its base\\", Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, \\"Sajid-Wajid and Prasoon Joshi can be rest assured that their music would reach out to the masses in a big way and find very good appreciation.\\" Hindustan Times gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, praising its \\"youthful fervour\\" and adding that \\"the album manages to capture the essence of three different periods on which the film is premised.\\" The Times of India gave it 3 out of 5, also commenting on its fresh and youthful feel, and calling it \\"another hit album\\" despite the fact that \\"it falls short in some songs\\". Koimoi gave the \\"good album\\" 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"as a package it has enough ingredients in it that would ensure that the songs do catch your attention when they are played on screen.\\" BBC identified the album as \\"A crowd pleaser featuring the cream of the industry's playback singers.\\" Release Kohli, Kapoor, and Chopra at a promotional event in 2012 Several stills from the films were released to the media before the trailer, which was posted online on 5 April 2012. Media publications noted the chemistry between Kapoor and Chopra, with Hindustan Times writing, \\"After a scintillating chemistry in Kaminey, Priyanka and Shahid look picture-perfect [and] ooze wonderful screen chemistry in each of their avatars.\\" Following the release of the theatrical trailer, media started speculating that the film might be a remake of or inspired by the 2005 Taiwanese film Three Times, which has a similar theme. However, Kohli denied the speculations, saying that he had not even seen that film and any resemblance was just a coincidence. \\"Now- a-days if you want to remake a film, you just buy the rights and make the film,\\" he said. \\"So if I wanted to make 'Three Times' I would have bought the rights.\\" The first-look poster of the film was released on 9 April 2012. A second trailer was released on 5 June 2012. The film's trailers and music built anticipation for the film. During the production stage, the film underwent several name changes. Initially, the media reported that the film was titled Janam Janam Ka Saath Hamara Tumhara, shortened to Janam Janam Ka Saath, but later it became Teri Meri Kahaani. In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated only that they had not yet decided the title of the film. Such speculation was believed to be a marketing choice to increase curiosity for the film. Made on a budget of 300 million, Teri Meri Kahaani was released on 22 June 2012, clashing with Gangs of Wasseypur - Part 1. The film had a \\"below the mark\\" opening, garnering only 30% collections. It performed best in the Delhi region. Reports stated that the only good news for the film was that collections had not dropped significantly on the second day. However, collections rose by the end of the weekend, amassing a total of 160 million for the film's opening weekend in India and a further $1.42 million overseas; its worldwide opening weekend collection stood at 295 million. By the fourth day it dropped around 55%. In its first week, the film went on to collect 230 million at the domestic box office and $2 million from overseas for a worldwide total of 414 million. By the end of its second week, it had collected domestically a total of 250 million. After its theatrical run, the film grossed over 370 million in India and $3 million from overseas for a worldwide total of over 540 million. The film underperformed at the Indian box-office, but performed well in the overseas market. Distributed by Eros International, a DVD was released on 14 August 2012 in all regions in a single-disc pack in NTSC format, with no bonus content. The VCD version was released at the same time. The Indian television premiere occurred on 3 January 2014 on Zee Cinema. Critical reception Critics praised the performances of the lead pair, their chemistry, the music and the production design, particularly the re-creation of 1960s Mumbai, but were disappointed with the story's predictability. Calling the film \\"uncomplicated and charming\\", Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Not the usual romantic fare, this one presents three different stories in three different eras without getting theatrical or melodramatic. Thanks to its innovative storytelling, it comes across as the perfect date movie, holding tremendous appeal for the Facebook Gen. Teri Meri Kahaani is pleasurable and fascinating in equal measures.\\" He said that the chemistry between the lead actors was what made the film work, and noted the production design as \\"impressive\\" and the cinematography as \\"top notch\\". Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5 stars, concluding, \\"Teri Meri Kahaani holds your attention whether it's the writing, storytelling, or the technical aspect. It's a popcorn cruncher, but that's also fairly intelligent and hearty.\\" She added that the two leads \\"sparkle with earnestness and zing,\\" with Kapoor \\"sure to increase his fan-following several fold\\" and Chopra \\"easily slipping in-and-out of the layered characters with dexterity.\\" Rummana Ahmed of Yahoo! movies labelled the film a \\"breezy romantic comedy which makes for an effortless watch\\". In another review, Business of Cinema gave a rating of 3 out of 5, stating, \\"Predictable, but beautifully told, 'Teri Meri Kahaani' is for die-hard romantics.\\" It also praised the versatility of the lead pair as they \\"effortlessly slip into the shoes of each character,\\" with their \\"wonderful\\" chemistry \\"strengthened by effective dialogues\\". Calling the film \\"charming\\", Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"Teri Meri Kahaani, with its breezy running time and frothy leads, continues the tradition in a much better manner than I anticipated.\\" She explained, \\"Kohli dilutes the chance of a wholesome, affable entertainer down by his predilection for risk-free conclusions. But [...] Teri Meri Kahaani is a far better film than I came to see.\\" Vinayak Chakravorty of India Today gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5, noting that the film tells the stories which \\"you and I already knew\\" and that the lead pair \\"hardly get a reason from the screenplay to give something extra to their roles.\\" Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 2 out of 5 with a review stating, \\"The film does have its moments for sure. Overall, it remains a sweet film ‚Äì a light and frothy entertainer, but without much substance.\\" Firstpost gave it a rating of 2 out of 5, noting that the film was all about Kapoor and Chopra's \\"magnetic screen presence\\" in \\"the picturesque surroundings they fall in love in. Director Kunal Kohli's dialogues hit the right notes, but not always. The story goes a tad askew and a bit flat in parts, so as a whole, Teri Meri Kahaani is not the greatest love story ever told on celluloid.\\" Rajeev Masand also gave it 2 out of 5 for being \\"harmless but dull\\"; though he said that the opening story \\"has a nice charm to it,\\" he felt that the film \\"doesn't work despite potential in the premise.\\"  References  External links  Category:2012 films Category:Indian films Category:2012 romantic drama films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films scored by Sajid-Wajid Category:Films with screenplays by Robin Bhatt Category:Films set in 1910 Category:Films set in 1960 Category:Films set in 2012 Category:Films shot in Mumbai Category:Films shot in London Category:Films directed by Kunal Kohli ","title":"Teri Meri Kahaani (film)"},{"id":"32561526","text":"Harindra Jayantha Corea (4 March 1936 - 21 October 2005) was a Sri Lankan politician and Member of Parliament, who represented Chilaw.

Guerra B. de Queiroz (born January 11, 1958 in Recife) is an associate professor at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and holds significant works in the research fields of Mathematical logic, proof theory, foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics. He is the founder of the Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation (WoLLIC), which has been organised annually since 1994, typically in June or July. Ruy de Queiroz received his B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from Escola Politecnica de Pernambuco in 1980, his M.Sc in Informatics from Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in 1984, and his Ph.D in Computing from the Imperial College, London in 1990, for which he defended the Dissertation Proof Theory and Computer Programming. An Essay into the Logical Foundations of Computation.  Research profile  In the late 1980s, Ruy de Queiroz has offered a reformulation of Martin-L√∂f type theory based on a novel reading of Wittgenstein‚Äôs \\"meaning-is-use\\", where the explanation of the consequences of a given proposition gives the meaning to the logical constant dominating the proposition. This amounts to a non-dialogical interpretation of logical constants via the effect of elimination rules over introduction rules, which finds a parallel in Paul Lorenzen's and Jaakko Hintikka's dialogue/game- semantics. This led to a type theory called \\"Meaning as Use Type Theory\\".de Queiroz, R. \\"Meaning as grammar plus consequences\\", in Dialectica 45(1):83-86. In reference to the use of Wittgenstein's dictum, he has shown that the aspect concerning the explanation of the consequences of a proposition is present since a very early date when in a letter to Bertrand Russell, where Wittgenstein refers to the universal quantifier only having meaning when one sees what follows from it.de Queiroz, R. \\"The mathematical language and its semantics: to show the consequences of a proposition is to give its meaning\\". In Weingartner, Paul and Schurz, Gerhard, editors, Reports of the Thirteenth International Wittgenstein Symposium 1988, volume 18 of Schriftenreihe der Wittgenstein-Gesellschaft, Vienna, 304pp. H√∂lder‚ÄìPichler‚ÄìTempsky, pp. 259‚Äì266. Symposium held in Kirchberg/Wechsel, Austria, August 14‚Äì21, 1988. Since later in the 1990s, Ruy de Queiroz has been engaged, jointly with Dov Gabbay, in a program of providing a general account of the functional interpretation of classical and non-classical logics via the notion of labeled natural deduction. As a result, novel accounts of the functional interpretation of the existential quantifier, as well as the notion of propositional equality, were put forward, the latter allowing for a recasting of Richard Statman's notion of direct computation, and a novel approach to the dichotomy \\"intensional versus extensional\\" accounts of propositional equality via the Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence. Since the early 2000s, Ruy de Queiroz has been investigating, jointly with Anjolina de Oliveira, a geometric perspective of natural deduction based on a graph-based account of Kneale's symmetric natural deduction.

It is in the Eastern Uplands of Kapoeta East County, near the border with Ethiopia. Location Nanyangachor is about northeast of Narus, in the dry season about a five-hour drive. In the rainy season the drive may take much longer. It is located on a plateau surrounded by mountains, and is much cooler than in the plains to the west. Cattle play an important role in the economy. Cattle raiding with their neighbors, including the Turkana people to the south in Kenya, is endemic. Periodically the people conduct peace meetings to try to find a way to prevent further raids. Women have increasingly been involved. Education and health The Catholic Diocese of Torit runs the Nanyang'achor Primary School. The diocese also operates a primary health care center at Nanyangachor, with a catchment population of over 300,000 people from the Toposa and Nyangatom ethnic groups. In 2007 there was an outbreak of measles in Nanyangachor, with 30 cases reported and one death as of 7 October. A later report said that 821 children had died of the disease and 2,500 more had been affected. By December that year the outbreak was under control. 20,551 children had been immunized in the villages of Naita, Bilamoi, Nakudochua, Kuron, Kauto areas and Nanyangachor west, a coverage of 60%. 2010 food emergency In March 2010 it was reported that Turkana from Kenya had again been conducting regular cattle raids in the area. The supply of food from Uganda and Kenya had deteriorated in 2010 due to lack of logistic support, poor road conditions and insecurity. People were managing to collect wild fruit, and had milk supplies. They were selling some animals for food in Narus and Kapoeta, but only to a very limited degree due to the danger and difficulty of the journey to market. Some children under five years old were suffering from Marasmus, caused by malnutrition. The World Food Programme was conducting a general food distribution. School attendance had decreased due to hunger. There were serious shortages of basic drugs in Nanyangachor Hospital.

Verona, 29 August 1964) is an Italian sports agent. He was one of the youngest FIFA-regulated agents, served as secretary general of the Assoprocuratori, has been deputy vice president of the Assoagenti since 2012 and is a member of the Italian FIGC Commissione Agenti. Biography As a teenager, D'Amico played several individual and team sports such as football, water polo, basketball and water skiing. Later, while studying at university, he worked as an instructor, teaching skiing and water skiing. His career as a sports agent began in July 1990. After graduating in law from the University of Modena in 1988, D'Amico studied for a master's degree in Marketing and Business Administration. During a casual meeting at the NH Milan Congress Centre, where the transfer market was being held, he met Oscar Damiani, who introduced him to Claudio Pasqualin, thus launching his career as a sports agent. In the beginning, he managed Pasqualin's players, then little by little began to manage his own, starting with the lower leagues. Career and awards According to the Italian Autorit√† Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, as a sports agent in 2006, D'Amico ranked in fifth place for market share by volume (2.62%) and in second place for market share by value (8.6%). He was voted best agent for the 2014/2015 football season, at the Italian Sport Awards. For 17 years, he was the agent for Gennaro Gattuso, who returned to Italy from Scotland, appearing for Milan some years later, and also in 1992 for Gianluigi Lentini, who initially was on loan from Turin rather than being transferred as a player to the Rossoneri team. He represented Alessandro Del Piero, securing and negotiating contracts and image, and brought Sebastian Giovinco first to Juventus and then to Toronto FC, where he was named Most Valuable Player in the 2015 Major League Soccer (MLS) season. Together with his associates, D'Amico has worked on signings for numerous footballers, including Francesco Toldo, Dino Baggio, Salvatore Bocchetti, Domenico Criscito, Marco Donadel, Luca Rigoni, Marco Rigoni, Maxi L√≥pez, Luca Antonini, Ignazio Abate, Vincenzo Iaquinta, Alberto Aquilani and Ishak Belfodil. In addition, he was instrumental in Fabio Cannavaro's transfer to Dubai-based Al- Ahli in 2010. D'Amico has been Marco Borriello's agent since January 2016. Following the opportunity to transfer to America to play in MLS, the former Carpi player was signed to Atalanta and is under contract until June 2016. Pasqualin D'Amico Partners D'Amico and Pasqualin together founded Pasqualin D'Amico Partners in 1990. Originating from Pasqualin Management founded in 1996 by the solicitor, today the company includes Alessandro D'Amico, Andrea's brother, and Luca Pasqualin, the solicitor's son. The company manages the careers of football players and also provides all types of assistance to players, from sponsorship contracts to issues concerning taxation, as well as legal and financial advice. It also acts for them in respect of media relations. Over the years, Pasqualin D'Amico Partners has been involved with some of the most significant businesses in the world of football. In addition, it has undertaken negotiations for Italian players to transfer to foreign teams, opening up the international market in Scotland, England and Spain. For example, it was instrumental in transferring Gianluca Vialli from Juventus to Chelsea, and transferring Sergio Porrini and Lorenzo Amoroso, from Fiorentina and Juventus respectively, to Rangers. Conversely, some of the great foreign football players have passed through the D'Amico and Pasqualin agency, such as Oliver Bierhoff, Thomas Helveg, Paolo Montero, Cristi√°n Zapata, Joachim Bj√∂rklund and Nuno Gomes. According to the Italian Autorit√† Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, in 2006 Pasqualin D'Amico Partners ranked in second place for market share by volume (3.52%) and by value (9.3%), behind Alessandro Moggi's GEA World.

She was wrecked off Prince Edward Island, Canada on 12 September 1882. Design The Doterel class was designed by Nathaniel Barnaby as a development of William Henry White's 1874 . The graceful clipper bow of the Ospreys was replaced by a vertical stem and the engines were more powerful. The hull was of composite construction, with wooden planks over an iron frame. Propulsion Power was provided by three cylindrical boilers, which supplied steam at to a two-cylinder horizontal compound-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. This arrangement produced and a top speed of .Winfield (2004) p.292 Armament Ships of the class were armed with two 7-inch (90 cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns on pivoting mounts, and four 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). Four machine guns and one light gun completed the weaponry. Sail plan All the ships of the class were provided with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and fore-and-aft sails only on the mizzen mast. Crew Phoenix would have had a normal complement of 140‚Äì150 men. Construction Phoenix was ordered from Devonport Dockyard and laid down on 8 July 1878. She was launched on 16 September 1879 and commissioned on 20 April 1880. Service Sloops of her type were designed for patrolling Britain's extensive maritime empire, and were normally sent to foreign stations for extended periods. Typically the crews would serve commissions of several years before handing their ship over to a newly arrived crew and returning home in another ship. Phoenix was sent to the North America and West Indies Station. Wreck Phoenix left Gasp√©, Quebec on the morning of 12 September 1882 under the command of Commander Hubert Grenfell. In company with , she was on her way to Canso, Nova Scotia. The wind was a north-east gale and the sea was thick with rain squalls. As she approached East Point from the north-west, under short sail and in the dark, the distance to East Point Light was judged to be 4 or 5 miles. In fact, the distance was deceptive, and with the tidal stream carrying the ship towards East Point at as much as , the ship was swept onto the East Point Reef in an approximate position of . The whole of 13 September was spent trying to save the ship, but the sea was too rough for boats to travel between the ship and the land. By 14 September 4 local fishermen were able to take a boat to Phoenix, which by now was sitting upright on the reef and flooded to the deck. Grenfell ordered the boats and rafts to make for the shore, and everybody on board was landed safely. Northampton was recalled by telegram from Halifax and brought with her Rear Admiral Sir Francis Leopold McClintock, the commander- in-chief of the North America and West Indies Station. The weather remained poor, and it was not until 19 September that the ship's company of Phoenix could be embarked. With the help of two small vessels, Foam and Charger, Phoenixs guns and heavy equipment were salvaged, but it was clear that the ship could not be refloated, and the salvage rights to the wreck were sold for ¬£3,000. The board of enquiry found that insufficient efforts had been made to establish the range of the light, and that the courses steered had been hazardous. Commander Grenfell was given a severe reprimand and dismissed ship, Lieutenant John Hill, the navigating officer, forfeited a year's seniority, and the gunner was reprimanded. By December 1883 there were only a few ribs to be seen at low water, and the scattered remains of the wreck now lie in less than of water. The wreck can be dived, although strong tidal streams make the area dangerous for all but the most experienced.

With 622 valid species assigned by 1987 to the subtribe Paederina (Paederus and its close allies), and with all but 148 within Paederus itself, the genus is large. Due to toxins in the hemolymph of some species within this genus, it has given its name to paederus dermatitis, a characteristic skin irritation that occurs if one of the insects is crushed against skin. That name, Paederus dermatitis, is a poor choice because, decades earlier, the affliction had been called dermatitis linearis, a name that works in all languages, not just English, because of its Latin origin; the name Paederus dermatitis is also inappropriate because it has shown to be caused by (a) only a few species of the genus Paederus, but (b) also a few species that belong to closely related genera (that are not Paederus) within the subtribe Paederina. A scholarly paper in 2002 suggested that a Paederus species could have been responsible for some of the ten Plagues of Egypt described in the Bible's Book of Exodus. Description Paederus littoralis, Portugal Like other beetles (Coleoptera), rove beetles have hardened forewings that cover the flight wings. At one time, the rove beetle group was known as \\"Brachyptera\\" (short wings), because their flight wings are folded under short elytra. Paederus species are widely distributed around the world. They are much more brightly colored than other rove beetles, with metallic blue- or green-colored elytra and many with bright orange or red on the pronotum and the basal segments of the abdomen. These bright colors may be an example of aposematism, a warning signal to potential predators. Although most adult rove beetles avoid daylight, Paederus species are active during the day and attracted to bright lights after nightfall. Paederus eggs are laid singly, in moist habitats. Larvae go through two instars before pupation. Both larvae and adults are predatory on other insects. Because of their preference for moist soil, large numbers of Paederus beetles may be attracted to irrigated farmland, where they provide some benefit by eating herbivorous insects but can cause problems for people working in fields or grassy areas. Pederin According to Medical and Veterinary Entomology (2009) \\"At least 20 of the more than 600 species of Paederus beetles have been associated with Paederus dermatitis\\", even though Paederus beetles do not bite or sting. This skin irritation results from contact with pederin, a vesicant toxin in the hemolymph of many but not all females in the genus Paederus. The toxin is manufactured, not by the beetles themselves, but by endosymbiont bacteria, probably some species of Pseudomonas. Impact on human beings Paederus dermatitis is caused when a pederin-containing beetle is crushed, even partially, against the skin. This skin irritation is also called \\"dermatitis linearis\\" or \\"linear dermatitis\\" because one can inadvertently drag a beetle across the skin in a more-or-less straight line when trying to brush it away. The resulting inflammation will also be linear. Because Paederus species are widely dispersed around the world, this syndrome has many different local nicknames including \\"whiplash dermatitis\\", \\"spider lick\\", and \\"Nairobi fly dermatitis\\". In East Africa, conjunctivitis from getting pederin in the eye is called \\"Nairobi eye\\". Once pederin is on the skin from the initial beetle contact, it may also be spread elsewhere on the skin. \\"Kissing\\" or \\"mirror-image\\" lesions where two skin areas come in contact (for example, the elbow flexure) are often seen. Washing the hands and skin with soap and water is strongly recommended if contact with a rove beetle has occurred. Initial skin contact with pederin shows no immediate result. Within 12‚Äì36 hours, however, a reddish rash (erythema) appears, which develops into blisters. Irritation, including crusting and scaling, may last from two to three weeks. Mass infestations An article in The Lancet suggests that events like those described as the first two of the ten plagues of Egypt (anoxic die-off in the Nile, followed by many dead frogs) would have created ideal breeding conditions for P. alfierii. The authors suggest that the plague of \\"boils\\" could be the skin irritation, typically delayed by a day or more, resulting from contact with Paederus during the third or fourth plagues (lice or flies). They also note that Paederus infestations are often localized, so it would be quite possible for them to have invaded Pharaoh's palace but not the homes of the Jews. Many modern occurrences of localized but intense Paederus impact are documented in research papers with titles like \\"An outbreak of paederus dermatitis in a suburban hospital in Sri Lanka\\", \\"An outbreak of 268 cases of Paederus dermatitis in a toy-building factory in central China\\", \\"Outbreak of dermatitis linearis caused by Paederus ilsae and Paederus iliensis (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) at a military base in Iraq\\", and \\"Evacuation of an Aboriginal community in response to an outbreak of blistering dermatitis induced by a beetle (Paederus australis)\\".

He is the chairman of the management board, and the head of business unit VimpelCom Ltd. For 15 years, Ihor Lytovchenko has been developing one of the most successful business projects in Ukraine. Under his command, Kyiv local cellular company has taken a leadership position in the national telecommunications market, providing services to 27 million subscribers around Ukraine.

His mother was a doctor, and he was to follow in his mother's footsteps, but in high school he changed his mind and set more ambitious goals. In 1983, Ihor Lytovchenko entered the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Social and Political History department. After the first course at the University, Ihor Lytovchenko joined the Soviet Army and served two years as a member of frontier troops. During the military service years the army leadership made special mention of him so that he was recommended to join the party, which was quite acceptable during the Soviet period. However, in 1985 he changed the plans and expectations of many people radically. Since the beginning of \\"perestroika\\" in the Soviet Union new opportunities appeared. Seeing them in proper perspective quite opportunely, Ihor Lytovchenko and his friends started a small trade business specialized in office equipment. After graduating from the University in 1990, and until 1994, Ihor Lytovchenko was an assistant director of the production association \\"Vita\\", and then was the head of the \\"Lotos\\" Company.

The first call on the Kyivstar network occurred on December 9, 1997.  Career  His work experience in leadership positions is 19 years. Since 1994 he has been Kyivstar President. In 2010 Ihor Lytovchenko filled a position of the Head of Ukraine business unit of VimpelCom Ltd. By the 15th anniversary of Kyivstar, Ihor Lytovchenko wrote Ukraine's first business novel \\"Lighting the Star. The First-person History of \\"Kyivstar\\"\\".

In June 2014, it was reported that Ihor Lytovchenko was leaving the company.Kyivstar founder Ihor Lytovchenko to quit company  Management of the \\"Kyivstar\\" Company  For many years Ihor Lytovchenko has been recognized as the best top manager in the sphere of telecommunications according to the main Ukrainian business media's ratings (Companion, TOP-100, GVardiya), while Kyivstar heads the list of the best and the most effective companies of Ukraine. It is under the command of Ihor Lytovchenko that the company has taken the leading positions as the top cellular operator and internet provider in the national telecommunications market. In 2010 Ihor Lytovchenko headed the business unit \\"Ukraine\\" company VimpelCom Ltd., which united Ukrainian telecom operators - Kyivstar and Beeline - Ukraine (close corporation Ukrainian Radio Systems and limited company Golden Telecom). Integration of the Kyivstar company, a mobile communications operator, and the Beeline-Ukraine, a fixed telecom business and broadband access based on FTTB, made it possible to create a multi-service operator with unique capacities and experience.

Pompey had been asked to intervene in a dispute over inheritance to the throne of the Hasmonean Kingdom, which turned into a war between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. His conquest of Jerusalem, however, spelled the end of Jewish independence and the incorporation of Judea as a client kingdom of the Roman Republic.  Background  The death of Hasmonean queen Alexandra Salome plunged Judea into a civil war between her two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. After Aristobulus had ousted his elder brother from both the throne and the high priesthood in Jerusalem, Antipater the Idumean advised Hyrcanus to enlist the aid of King Aretas III of Nabataea. In return for the promise of territorial concessions, Aretas provided Hyrcanus with 50,000 soldiers, and their joint forces besieged Aristobulus in Jerusalem.Sartre 2005, pp. 40-42Malamat and Ben-Sasson 1976, pp. 222-224 Pompey had followed the successful conclusion of the Third Mithridatic War with the creation of the Province of Syria and had spent the years of 64 and 63 BC in bringing law and order to the region.Sartre 2005, pp. 39-40 Events in Judea prompted Aemilius Scaurus, Pompey's legate in Damascus, to arrive in Jerusalem. Scaurus was approached by both parties, but the issue was settled by a bribe from Aristobulus,Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:128 and Scaurus ordered Aretas to lift his siege of the city. As the Nabataean army withdrew towards Petra, Aristobulus set off in pursuit and defeated the Nabataeans at Papyron. When Pompey himself arrived in Damascus in 63 BC, both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus visited him there. Pompey put off resolving the issue and informed the opposing parties he would resolve it once he had arrived in Judea in person. Aristobulus did not wait for Pompey's decision and left Damascus to shut himself away at his fortress of Alexandrium. That angered Pompey, who marched into Judea with his forces at the sight of which Aristobulus yielded. When Aulus Gabinius led a force to take Jerusalem, however, Aristobulus's supporters refused to let the Roman troops in. Incensed, Pompey had Aristobulus arrested and prepared to besiege the city.Rocca 2008, pp. 44-46  Siege  When Pompey arrived in Jerusalem, he surveyed the city: Hyrcanus II still had supporters in the city who opened a gate, probably in the northwestern part of the city wall, and let the Romans in. That allowed Pompey to take hold of Jerusalem's upper city, including the royal palace, and Aristobulus's party held the eastern portions of the city: the Temple Mount and the City of David. The Jews consolidated their hold by breaking down the bridge over the Tyropoeon Valley that connected the upper city with the Temple Mount.Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:143 Pompey offered them the chance to surrender, but their refusal made him begin to prosecute the siege with vigour. Pompey had his forces construct a wall of circumvallation around the areas that were held by the Jews. He then pitched his camp within the wall, to the north of the Temple, where stood a saddle allowed access to the Temple and so was guarded by the citadel known as the Baris, augmented by a ditch.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 14:61 A second camp was erected southeast of the Temple. The troops then set about filling the ditch that protected the northern part of the Temple enclosure and building two ramparts, one next to the Baris and the other on the west. The defenders, from their superior position, sought to hinder Roman efforts. When the banks were complete, Pompey erected siege towers and brought up siege engines and battering rams from Tyre. Under the protection of slingers driving the defenders from the walls, they began to batter the walls surrounding the Temple.Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:145-147, mentions the towers, siege engines and slingersJosephus, Antiquities of the Jews 14:62: \\"...he brought his mechanical engines and battering-rams from Tyre\\". After three months, Pompey's troops finally managed to overthrow one of the Baris towers and were able to enter the Temple precinct, both from the citadel and from the west. First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, the son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey's army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, who each led a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews, 12,000 of whom were slaughtered. However, only a few Romans troops were killed.Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:149-151 Pompey himself entered the Temple's Holy of Holies, which only the High Priest was allowed to enter, and thus desecrated it. He did not remove anything, neither its treasures nor any funds, and the next day, he ordered the Temple cleansed and its rituals resumed.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 14:70-71Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 1:152-153 Pompey then headed back to Rome and took Aristobulus with him for his triumphal procession. Aftermath The siege and the conquest of Jerusalem were a disaster for the Hasmonean Kingdom. Pompey reinstated Hyrcanus II as the High Priest but stripped him of his royal title though Rome recognised him as an ethnarch in 47 BC.Rocca 2009, p. 7 Judea remained autonomous but was obliged to pay tribute and became dependent on the Roman administration in Syria. The kingdom was dismembered and was forced to relinquish the coastal plain, depriving it of access to the Mediterranean, as well as parts of Idumea and Samaria. Several Hellenistic cities were granted autonomy to form the Decapolis, leaving the state greatly diminished.  References  Notes Bibliography  Josephus, Flavius.
