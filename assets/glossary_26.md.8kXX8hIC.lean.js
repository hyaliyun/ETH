It provides all the information necessary to describe RESTful or practically RESTful APIs. Although designed with RESTful APIs in mind, RAML is capable of describing APIs that do not obey all constraints of REST (hence the description \\"practically RESTful\\"). It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. History RAML was first proposed in 2013. The initial RAML specification was authored by Uri Sarid, Emiliano Lesende, Santiago Vacas and Damian Martinez, and garnered support from technology leaders like MuleSoft, AngularJS, Intuit, Box, PayPal, Programmable Web and API Web Science, Kin Lane, SOA Software, and Cisco. Development is managed by the RAML Workgroup. The current workgroup signatories include technology leaders from MuleSoft (Uri Sarid, CTO), AngularJS (Misko Hevery, Project Founder), Intuit (Ivan Lazarov, Chief Enterprise Architect), Airware (Peter Rexer, Director of Product - Developer Platform), Programmable Web and API Science (John Musser, Founder), SOA Software (Tony Gullotta, Director of Development), Cisco (Jaideep Subedar, Senior Manager, Product Management - Application Integration Solutions Group), VMware (Kevin Duffey, Senior MTS Engineer), Akamai Technologies (Rob Daigneau, Director of Architecture for Akamai‚Äôs OPEN API Platform) and Restlet (Jerome Louvel, CTO and Founder). RAML is a trademark of MuleSoft. Very few existing APIs meet the precise criteria to be classified as RESTful APIs. Consequently, like most API initiatives in the 2010s, RAML has initially focussed on the basics of practically RESTful APIs including resources, methods, parameters, and response bodies that need not be hypermedia. There are plans to move towards more strictly RESTful APIs as the evolution of technology and the market permits. There are a number of reasons why RAML has broken out from being a proprietary vendor language and has proven interesting to the broader API community: * RAML has been open-sourced along with tools and parsers for common languages. The development of RAML will be overseen by a steering committee of API and UX practitioners, and there is an emerging ecosystem of third party tools being developed around RAML * MuleSoft originally started using Swagger (now OpenAPI Specification), but decided it was best suited to documenting an existing API, not for designing an API from scratch. RAML evolved out of the need to support up- front API design in a succinct, human-centric language * API descriptions are often verbose and repetitive, which can make them difficult to understand and use, and slow adoption of the APIs. RAML has introduced language features that support structured files and inheritance that address cross-cutting concerns A new organization, under the sponsorship of the Linux Foundation, called the Open API Initiative was set up in 2015 to standardize the description of RESTful APIs. A number of companies including SmartBear, Google, IBM and Microsoft were founding members. SmartBear donated the Swagger specification to the new group. RAML and API Blueprint are also under consideration by the group. Example This is an example RAML file. As with YAML, indentation shows nesting. #%RAML 0.8 title: World Music API baseUri: http://example.api.com/{version} version: v1 traits: \\\\- paged: queryParameters: pages: description: The number of pages to return type: number \\\\- secured: !include http://raml-example.com/secured.yml /songs: is: [ paged, secured ] get: queryParameters: genre: description: filter the songs by genre post: /{songId}: get: responses: 200: body: application/json: schema: { \\"$schema\\": \\"http://json-schema.org/schema\\", \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"description\\": \\"A canonical song\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"title\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\" }, \\"artist\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\" } }, \\"required\\": [ \\"title\\", \\"artist\\" ] } application/xml: delete: description: This method will *delete* an **individual song** Some highlights: * line 7, 12: defines traits, invoked in multiple places * line 12: an Include file * line 13, 14: define a \\"resource\\" data type \\"/songs\\"; uses previously defined traits * line 15, 19, 37: defines HTTP methods * line 25, 36: MIME types.

Early life and education Wilson was born in San Francisco in 1969, but spent his childhood growing up on the Navajo Nation. He attended the government boarding school in Tuba City through 8th grade and was then plucked from the reservation and sent to Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts with a scholarship from the \\"A Better Chance (ABC)\\" Foundation. He attended Oberlin College as an undergraduate with a major in studio art, and obtained a Master's of Fine Arts in photography at the University of New Mexico. He has been an artist-in-residence at the School for Advanced Research. Career Since 2012, Wilson had been involved in the creation of a project titled the Critical Indigenous Photographic Exchange (CIPX). Inviting a number of indigenous artists and other professionals, they are all involved in the production of various pieces of art of indigenous peoples that pose for them. Wilson, himself, uses a \\"old fashioned, large format camera and the historic wet plate collodion process\\" in order to create photos that are reflective of historic photographs. The resulting studio of photos from him and the other artists have been featured in a number of museums, including the Denver Museum of Art and the New Mexico Museum of Art. In 2014, Wilson's work was included in an exhibition of contemporary Native American Photography, As We See It, alongside Matika Wilbur, Tom Jones, Larry McNeil, and Shelly Niro, among others. The exhibition traveled through Russia and in 2016 and 2017 will visit the American West.

It contains the village of Ballyvaughan. Name The name \\"Drumcreehy\\" comes from the situation of the original parish church on a hillside or ridge in the territory of Crioch Maille or Droim Cr√≠che, possibly derived from Droim Cr√≠che U√≠ Maille (\\"the ridge of O'Malley's territory\\"). Location The parish is in the north of the Barony of Burren on Ballyvaughan bay, on the south shore of Galway Bay. It is northwest of Corofin. The parish is and covers . The land was once rocky and mountainous, and mostly unsuitable for farming. It rises to above sea level at Cappanavalla hill on the western boundary. History A battle was fought in 1317 beside Lough Rask which is near Ballyvaughan. In 1834 there was neither church, chapel nor school in the parish. Villages in 1845 were Ballyvaughan, Ballyconree, Ballinacraggy and Loughrask. In 1841 the population was 2,331 in 362 houses, mostly living along the coastline. Antiquities There are many stone ringforts and caves in varying condition in the parish. Attempts to date the church of Drumcreehy currently place its construction from the 11th/12th to the 13th/14th century. A church definitely existed here in the 14th century as it was mentioned in a tax list, but at the time likely consisted only of the nave (collapsed today). The chancel was probably added only in the 15th or 16trh century. As of 1897 the church was partly ruined, surrounded by a large cemetery. A few hundred meters from the church there are the remains of a religious house on the lands called \\"The Bishop‚Äôs Quarter\\", but there are no records of the establishment. The Bishop of Kilfenora drew rent from 120 acres of land here in the early 17th century. The parish contains the remains of four castles or tower houses: * Ballyvaughan Castle (Baile-Ui-Beachain) stood on the edge of the small harbor in the village. It has now almost entirely disappeared. * The two castles named Muckinish (Muck inis, Irish for pig island) were reportedly built within three years of each other in the 15th century (Nua means new, Sean means old). As of 1897, Muckinish Nua (or Muckinish Noe), on the bay of Pouldoody, was badly damaged. Shanmuckinish Castle ( or Seanmuckinish, Shan Muckinish) was repaired around 1836, and as of 1897 was habitable. The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes the latter as: \\"remains of free-standing square-plan single bay four-storey rubble stone-built tower house, c. 1450.\\" Both ruins reach almost to their original height of around 17 m and are partially collapsed, exposing a cross-sectional view of the interior floors. Due to the similarities of their names the chronology of ownership is confused. Shanmuckinish was also known for a time as Ballynacragga Castle. This may be an indication that the MacNamara family lived here, bringing the name of their family castle near Dromoland Castle from which they were expelled in 1654. Otherwise, both Muckinish castles were inhabited up to the 19th century by members of the O'Loghlen, Neylon and Blake families. *Newtown Castle has been completely restored and houses the Burren College of Art. All four castles were owned by an O'Loghlen in 1580. Townlands Townlands are Acres, Ballycahill, Ballyconry, Ballyvaughan, Bishopsquarter, Dangan, Killoghil, Knocknagroagh, Lisnanard, Loughrask, Muckinish East, Muckinish West, Newtown and Tonarussa.

Given an initial monetary grant by Ben Cohen, the group purchased and retrofit a cargo van to hold and maneuver a 12,000 lumen projector. Typically the van is used by the collective to aid existing political movements. The group has worked with large political organizations such as Green Peace but typically assists grass roots movements in and around New York City. Activity On November 17, 2012 The Illuminator projected the iconic 99% logo onto the Verizon building in Lower Manhattan as its first mission. It was meant to inspire protestors after they were evicted from Zuccoti Park and marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in clear view of the Verizon Building. The group also received notoriety for its projections on April 15, 2013 which consisted of messages of \\"solidarity\\" with the people of Boston after the Boston Marathon bombing. The projections were seen on the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 2015, after an unsanctioned statue of Edward Snowden was taken down by the NYPD, the group put up a temporary \\"holographic\\" statue in its place. Mission statement The group's website claims that the goal of the project is \\"To smash the myths of the information industry and allow people to find out for themselves what the 99% movement is fighting for.\\" On a March, 2014 WNYC segment, members voiced concerns over late capitalism including political corruption and environmental damage. Legal troubles At least three members of the project have been taken in for questioning by the NYPD on more than one occasion. On February 8, 2013, an Illuminator was arrested after projecting a ballot box stuffed with dollar bills onto Mayor Michael Bloomberg's apartment in Manhattan. Two members, Kyle Depew and Grayson Earle were also arrested and charged with Illegal Advertising on September 9, 2014 after projecting onto the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum had accepted a $60 million donation from billionaire David Koch, an avid climate change denier. During the dinner party for the event, the group projected \\"Koch = Climate Chaos\\" onto the museum. They were arrested and detained over night, though the charges were dropped soon after.

Peters was born at Morpeth, Northumberland. The highlight of his career after retirement was his co-founding, with Martin Dent of Keele University, of the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign, which went on to become the Make Poverty History movement. He studied Greats at Balliol College, Oxford, but his studies were interrupted by World War II when he saw active service with the 9th Ghurkha rifles. After the war he completed his undergraduate studies in 1948 and went on to further study at the LSE and SOAS. Peters then joined the Colonial Service with a posting to the Gold Coast in 1950 where he worked to prepare for the transition to independence. In 1977, he became British Ambassador to Uruguay. He went on to work as High Commissioner in Malawi before retiring from the Foreign Office in 1983. A few years after retirement Peters met Martin Dent of Keele University and realised that Martin shared his concern at what they considered to be unsustainable levels of third world debt. They co-founded a campaign to write off third-world debt in time for the Millennium. They called this Jubilee 2000 in reference to the Old Testament Jubilee requirement to cancel debts every seven years. It was supported by the Anglican Church, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, addressing a rally in Trafalgar Square with Bill and Martin and making Jubilee 2000 the subject of his New Year's Day Millennium address on BBC 1. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown also spoke at a rally in St Paul's Cathedral, strongly supporting the campaign and confirming the cancellation of all debts to the UK. Peters continued to play an active role in the Drop the Debt campaign in the lead up to the Millennium, seeing it grow into a series of large- scale demonstrations and twice enter The Guinness Book Of Records, once for the largest petition and once for the most international petition. The campaign launched major demonstrations at every G8 summit from 1998 in Birmingham to Cologne and Genoa with a few people even travelling to Okinawa in Japan. Peters received the Gandhi International Peace Award from the Gandhi Foundation in recognition of his efforts and of the success of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which 'made possible the provision of basic education and health-care to thousands of people.'

Abraham Davel, after studying in Lausanne, became a notary and land commissioner. In 1692, he began his military career in the service of Prince Eugene of Savoy and John Churchill. He participated alongside the Bernese in the second Villmergen War of 1712, and after the victory of the Protestant alliance received a pension and settled in Vaud where he resumed judicial office. In 1717, he was appointed by the Bernese to command the Vaud militia of the district of Lavaux. In the face of Vaudois resistance to the introduction of the Helvetic Consensus, Davel felt himself to be called by God to liberate his country from the power of Berne. On 31 March 1723 he entered Lausanne in the company of 500 to 600 unarmed men at a moment when the Bernese bailiffs were absent. There, he assembled the municipal council, and presented them with a manifesto in which a number of failures and abuses were levelled at the government in Bern. And so he made public his plan aiming for the autonomy of the land of Vaud. But the council immediately reported the incident to Bern, and Davel was arrested on 1 April. He maintained, even under torture that his undertaking was suggested directly by God and that he had no accomplices. He was condemned by the court of citizens (Lausanne) to death and was beheaded on 24 April at Vidy. Today the Vaud section of the Swiss fraternity, Zofingia, commemorates the sacrifice of Major Davel every 24 April, in a procession following his route on that day in 1723, leaving from the Ch√¢teau Saint-Maire in Lausanne and leading up to the monument at Vidy, the site of his execution. A stele was erected in Louis Bourget Park at the place where the scaffolding was placed. It bears the following inscription: \\"Here Davel gave his life for his country, 24 April 1723\\".

Early life Braden was born Robert Alan Braden on 6 February 1927 in Manchester. Together with his elder brother, Edwin Braden, he started performing on the stage as young as 5 years old and became a member of his brother Edwin's, \\"Edwin Braden and the Royal Sequence Dance Band\\" playing until Edwin was drafted into the Army at the outset of war.  Wartime  At the outbreak of war, Braden was only 13 year old but with his father a railway signalman supervisor (a reserved profession) and his brother of fighting age, he found himself and his mother mostly alone. Already a very accomplished musician he now found himself much in demand and spend many evenings playing gigs in and around Manchester. He joined the Air Training Corps (ATC) and found himself being prepared to become a navigator. He was duly drafted into the Royal Air Force and trained on Wellington bombers. The war in Europe ended before he was deployed and he was transferred to the Army Signals Corps and prepared for deployment in the Far East. Once again the war ended before deployment and he was demobbed in 1946. Whilst in the services, he was much in demand as a musician and played in the Rpyal Core of Signals band at Catterick training establishment. He recalls having met Glenn Miller, describing him as the absolute cream of the bandleaders.  Post-war career On demobilisation, he quickly returned to being a full-time musician, playing with many of the big bands of the time, including Joe Loss, Teddy Foster and Ted Heath as well as forming and leading his own band. Ultimately, the lure of television and work from Tin Pan Alley (Denmark Street publishing houses) brought him to London.  London  Braden was a much-in- demand session clarinetist and saxophonist as well as a talented arranger and composer and it was not long before he got his first big break on television with the Redifusion produced Stars and Garters, a show about a working class pub of the same name featuring Braden as the bandleader and starring Kathy Kirby, Clinton Ford and Vince Hill. Television Braden's work for television has included London Night Out, The Sooty Show, Night Out at the London Casino, The Two Ronnies, The Chipperfields Circus Specials, Get Some In!, Armchair Theatre, Up Pompeii, Give Us A Clue, The Ken Dodd Laughter Show, Mike Yarwood in Persons, Billy Dainty Esq., The Tommy Cooper Hour, Name That Tune and the 1979 version of the classic comedy short film The Plank. In the early Sooty Shows the puppet characters were seen to ‚Äòplay‚Äô various musical instruments at the end of the show with his Sooty-Braden Showband.Alan Braden at BFI Retrieved 8 April 2014 Throughout his career, Braden worked with many of the big names of the time, including Nat King Cole, The Beatles, Elton John, Petula Clarke, Tom Jones, Tom O'Connor, Lionel Blair, Cilla Black, Roy Hudd, Danny La Rue, Peggy Lee, and Louis Armstrong. Family Braden was married to Margaret Braden and had two sons, Stephen Alan Braden (born 16 May 1955) and Philip Robert Braden (born 14 May 1960).

MetPA makes use of advances originally developed for pathway analysis in microarray experiments and applies those principles and concepts to the analysis of metabolic pathways. For input, MetPA expects either a list of compound names (identified as statistically significant or significant perturbed) or a metabolite concentration table with phenotypic labels (i.e. sick vs. healthy). The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. MetPA‚Äôs output is a series of tables indicating which pathways are significantly enriched (along with accompanying statistics) as well as a variety of graphs or pathway maps illustrating where and how certain pathways were enriched. MetPA‚Äôs graphical output uses a colorful Google-Maps visualization system that allows simple, intuitive data exploration that lets users employ a computer mouse or track pad to select, drag and place images and to seamlessly zoom in and out. Users can explore MetPA‚Äôs output using three different views or levels: 1) a metabolome view; 2) a pathway view; 3) a compound view. MetPA Details As noted above MetPA performs two types of pathway analysis: 1) Pathway (or Metabolite Set) Enrichment Analysis; and 2) Pathway Topological Analysis. Pathway Enrichment Analysis (which is similar to MSEA) identifies which metabolic pathways have compounds (from the input lists) that are over-represented and have significant perturbations to their concentrations. MetPA uses a number of robust statistical measures to identify which pathways and which metabolites are over-represented. Pathway Topological Analysis measures the centrality of a metabolite in a metabolic network or a metabolic pathway. Central or highly important metabolites are ‚Äúhubs‚Äù, located in the center of a metabolic pathway or process. MetPA employs a number of topological assessment tools to measure centrality or ‚Äúhubness‚Äù in an objective manner (called Pathway Impact). Pathway impact is a combination of the centrality and pathway enrichment results. It is calculated adding up the importance measures of each of the matched metabolites and then dividing by the sum of the importance measures of all metabolites in each pathway. To begin a session on MetPA users must first have a list of significant compounds derived from a metabolomic tests or compounds and concentration data with information about the phenotype of the organisms under study. The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. Once the data is uploaded to MetPA users must choose the organism with which the pathway analysis will be done. Ideally the metabolomic data should be from one of the 15 model organisms listed in the MetPA organism menu. If the organism or interest is not listed, then users may choose a closely related organism. If none of the organisms are thought to be sufficiently close, then users may inquire with the web site developers to see if the organism may be added. Central to the operation of MetPA is its library of metabolic pathways for different model organisms. These were assembled from the KEGG database which were separated into graphical models using the KEGGgraph package. The current MetPA collection contains more than 1170 different metabolic pathways derived from 15 model organisms covering mammals (Humans, Mouse, Rat, Cow, Chicken), fish (Zebrafish), plants (Arabidopsis, Rice) insects (Drosophila) and microbes (Yeast, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida, and Thermotoga maritima.). To simplify viewing and navigation on the server, and to assist with the topological analyses, all the KEGG pathways in MetPA are presented as a network with metabolites serving as nodes and reactions as edges. MetPA provides an extensive tutorial explaining how to upload data and how interpret its output. In 2011 MetPA functions were expanded and integrated into MetaboAnalyst. This integration allows users to perform a more complete analysis and to link to other data processing and data interpretation functions available through MetaboAnalyst.

He has also written in English and Spanish. Early life Vall√©s was born 4 November 1925 in Logro√±o, Spain to an engineer. When he was ten, his father died of Vincent's angina. Six months later, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, he fled his home, along with his mother and brother, and went to live with his mother's aunt, leaving everything behind. He attended a Jesuit school there along with his brother. He became a Jesuit novitiate when he was fifteen and was sent to India in 1949 as a missionary. India years In India, Vall√©s attended Madras University and completed an MA in mathematics with first class honours in 1953. There, he learned English to complete his studies. He later started learning the Gujarati language, as he was asked to teach mathematics at the newly opened St Xavier's college in Ahmedabad, which had Gujarati students. He learned Gujarati for two years, and later practised writing it during his four-year theological studies at Pune. He was ordained to the priesthood on 24 April 1958. He started teaching mathematics in Ahmedabad in 1960. He translated many mathematical concepts into Gujarati for Gujarat University and coined terms for them. He helped to start and contributed regularly to the first mathematical review in an Indian language, Suganitam. He also contributed in Gujarati to the encyclopaedia Gnanganga on mathematical topics. He participated in World Mathematical Congress in Moscow, Exeter, and Niece. In 1960, he wrote a Gujarati book titled Sadachar, which he published with the help from his mother, since nobody agreed to publish it. It was successful and he was invited to write in the monthly Kumar by its editors. Five years later he started writing for Kumar and won its annual Kumar Prize for best writing in the monthly. Later, he started writing in Sunday supplement of Gujarat Samachar in a column titled Navi Pedhine (\\"To the new generation\\"). It was successful and his articles were later published as a book. Later, he left his staff quarters in the college and started living with people to understand their life. He would live with one family for a few days and then move to the next one. He lived this way for ten years. Later life He retired from his mathematics chair and left India. He settled in Madrid and accompanied his ninety-year-old mother until she died at the age of 101. He continued to write in Gujarati, and began translating and writing in English and Spanish focused on his experiences in India and in Latin America. Works His work includes more than seventy books in Gujarati and about hundred in English and Spanish. He wrote twelve books on mathematics. He also co-authored the series of mathematics textbooks in Gujarati.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It was enacted as Division M of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law 113‚Äì235 (128 Stat. 2130).See Proposed Regulation published in Federal Register, Vol. 81, No. 112, Friday, June 10, 2016, p. 38020. Background An expatriate (sometimes shortened to expat) is a person temporarily or permanently residing in a country other than that of the person's upbringing. The word comes from the Latin terms ex (\\"out of\\") and patria (\\"country, fatherland\\"). In common usage, the term is often used in the context of professionals or skilled workers sent abroad by their companies, rather than for all 'immigrants' or 'migrant workers'. In May 2013, the State Department estimated that there are currently 7.6 million Americans living outside the United States. Provisions of the bill The bill would exempt expatriate health care plans from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. An \\"expatriate health care plan\\" is one in which substantially all participants are \\"qualified expatriates\\"; the bill defines a \\"qualified expatriate\\" as U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or non-immigrant about whom there is a good faith expectation of being abroad, in connection with his or her employment, for at least 90 days in a 12-month period, or of traveling abroad on at least 15 occasions during such a period; or an individual who is abroad as a member of a group determined appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Procedural history The Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 7, 2014 by Rep. John Carney (D-DE). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, and the United States House Committee on House Administration. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a suspension of the rules, indicating that the House leadership expected to easily get the two-thirds majority needed for passage. The bill passed the House on April 29, 2014 with sixty Democrats and 208 Republicans voting in favor. The White House expressed reservations, stating that the bill \\"would reduce consumer protections and create even more loopholes in the tax code.\\" Debate and discussion The bill was considered \\"bipartisan.\\" It was introduced by a Democrat and co- sponsored by 11 more Democrats and 9 Republicans. If the bill became law, it would be the eighth law modifying Obamacare to become law, although over 50 attempts have been made, indicating how much bipartisan support this bill would have. Rep. John Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high- quality health care plans designed to meet their unique needs as expatriates. Carney said that \\"expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a global network of health care providers.\\" Carney indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the tax and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans. President Barack Obama's administration already temporarily addressed this issue by exempting through 2017 some expatriate healthcare providers from the requirements. On the occasion of the bill's passage by the House, Delaware Governor Jack Markell issued a statement praising his state's Congressmen for their work on the bill, saying that it would keep hundreds of Cigna jobs from being moved out of their state.

LMDC existed for six years (1970‚Äì76) ‚Äì two years in the combat zone of Vietnam, and for four years amidst disciplinary clashes inside US military forces in West Germany (with additional military cases in the Philippines and Italy). During this period high caliber civilian representation and counseling by a cohort of young attorneys were provided free of charge country-wide, in often challenging and controversial cases for hundreds of service members, including scores of trial and post-trial proceedings. Initial logistical obstacles in Vietnam were ultimately resolved satisfactorily, so that communications with clients (and prospective clients), other counsel, and the court could be accomplished pursuant to newly issued U.S. Army regulations, as were needs for access to military transport, billeting, and research facilities. In almost every instance representation by LMDC lawyers was welcomed by assigned military counsel. LMDC's operations in a war zone were unique. No undertaking of its kind has appeared in subsequent US conflicts.  Founding  In early 1970, from previous experiences at Clark Air Base in the Philippines where she observed the need for independent legal counsel for U.S. overseas military personnel, donor Anne Peretz set in motion the creation of LMDC. A board of directors of noted academic and civil rights attorneys was formed, including Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson, professor John H. Mansfield (also of Harvard), ACLU general counsel Norman Dorsen, ACLU legal director Melvin Wulf, Indiana University law professor Edward F. Sherman, and Boston civil liberties attorney William Homans. (Quaker peace activist, May Bye, subsequently joined the board with the opening of the LMDC office in West Germany.) Other supporters were former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, former U.S. Justice Department official Burke Marshall, and Dean Abraham Goldstein of the Yale Law School. The aim of the office focused on representing military clients whose cases raised issues of dissent (e.g., conscientious objection and protests against the war), racism, constitutional rights, and command influence.\\"Liberties in Vietnam: Defending the Troops,\\" Mansfield, John H., Civil Liberties: Publication of the American Civil Liberties Union, Number 284, Feb/1972. Mansfield described the rationale for LMDC in the following terms: \\"The charge has been made by a writer in the Armed Forces Journal that civilian lawyers and LMDC in particular, by making servicemen more aware of their rights and ready to press new legal theories, have contributed to the collapse of the armed forces in Vietnam. This accusation must not go unanswered for it entirely misconstrues the function of law both in the armed forces and society at large. The purpose of the military justice system is not simply to add muscle to a commander's arbitrary fiat. It exists both to assure good order in the armed forces and to protect the basic rights of all their members, to assure them of procedural fairness, to stand as a bulwark against arbitrary power, vindictiveness, and stupid mistakes. When it functions in this fashion it earns for the services the loyalty and support of their members. It gives servicemen the assurance that as individuals they will not be trampled upon and invariably sacrificed to supposed organizational interests‚Ä¶. From this perspective, an intelligently and conscientiously administered military justice system, with vigorous advocacy by both prosecution and defense, is no enemy to the armed forces. Rather, it can be one of the elements that saves them from the serious demoralization that now prevails and leads back to union with the civilian community from which ultimately they must derive their strength and reason for existence. The purpose of civilian advocacy is not to break down the armed forces as an organization capable of performing the important tasks entrusted to them, but to enable them to perform these tasks in a manner that conforms to their own highest ideals and fundamental norms of the Constitution.\\"  Funding  Funding came from charitable sources, including board member and major contributor Anne Peretz, The Rockefeller Family Fund, The Playboy Foundation, sales of lithographs and cartoons from artists Alexander Calder, Garry Trudeau, and Jules Feiffer, The Sachem Fund, several Quaker charities, Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, and direct mail appeals. Wednesday, 18 January 2017  History  = Saigon office (1970‚Äì72) = Peter Hagerty, a navy veteran from the Harvard ROTC program, traveled to Vietnam in late summer of 1970, promoting by word of mouth the availability of LMDC legal services to GIs.Hagerty describes his efforts on behalf of LMDC in, A Matter of Conscience: GI Resistance During the Vietnam War, p. 20. Oral Histories by Willa Seidenberg and William Short, Andover, MA: Phillips Academy (1991). Shortly thereafter, LMDC opened its doors at 203 Tu Do Street in the heart of Saigon. Initial staff members were director Henry Aronson, attorneys David Addlestone, Joseph Remcho, and office manager Susan Sherer. Attorney Dolores Donovan joined the office from March to November 1971. Later staff members (1971‚Äì72) were attorneys Howard De Nike and Edward Kopanski, and law student Susan Thorner. = Heidelberg office (1972‚Äì76) = A second LMDC office opened at Maerzgasse 7, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany, in August 1972, with the arrival of Howard De Nike, who had been working with LMDC in Saigon. Attorney Robert Rivkin joined the office in October 1972. Later staff members in West Germany were attorneys Mark Schreiber (1974), William Schaap (1974‚Äì75), and Christopher Coates (1974‚Äì76), along with summer interns Gale Glazer and Louis Font (1973 and 1974), and, legal assistant Ellen Ray (1974‚Äì75). Attorney David Addlestone provided stateside support in the form of federal court litigation and fundraising throughout operation of LMDC's West German office. = Vietnam (1970‚Äì72) = Year One (1970‚Äì71): Staff ‚Äì director Henry Aronson (September 1970 ‚Äì November 1971), attorneys David Addlestone (November 1970 ‚Äì November 1971, accompanied by wife Irene and infant son Benjamin), Joseph Remcho (December 1970 ‚Äì November 1971), Dolores Donovan (March‚ÄìNovember 1971), and office manager Susan Sherer (October 1970 ‚Äì December 1971).  Significant cases  In its initial year LMDC in Vietnam faced numerous logistical obstacles. Through the efforts in Vietnam of director Aronson and office manager Sherer (assisted stateside by pressure exerted by the board of directors on the Pentagon and litigated extensively in the Vietnam court-martial U.S. v. McLemore) negotiations for office lease, access to military communication systems, military transport to courts-martial sites, and use of military legal research facilities were concluded successfully. Court-martial defense and counseling services concentrated on matters of conscientious objection (e.g., Phu Cat 3 ‚Äì airmen who refused to carry weapons on guard duty and were not as required informed of conscientious objector discharge application procedures), fragging prosecutions, access by confinees at Long Binh stockade (aka \\"LBJ\\" ‚Äì \\"Long B√¨nh Jail\\") to reading materials and visitors (e.g., Reverend Hosea Williams during his 1971 Vietnam tour). LMDC defended SP4 Gussie Davis against capital charges in a racially tinged double homicide.Described in Winners and Losers (1977) an American National Book Award winner by New York Times Vietnam War correspondent Gloria Emerson. LMDC protected efforts by U.S. Air Force and naval personnel to circulate an anti-war petition in Vietnam.Resolved adversely, Carlson v. Schlesinger, 511 F. 2d 1372 (D.C. Cir. 1975).

(From May to August 1972, De Nike worked for LMDC in the Philippines, counseling and defending U.S. naval personnel at Subic Bay, and U.S. airmen at Clark Air Force Base.)  Significant cases  December 1971, De Nike defended two soldiers (SP4 Lyver and SP4 Beller) charged with disobeying orders to provide urine samples for drug testing. (The special court-martial convictions were later overturned on reviews through the UCMJ appellate system argued by LMDC attorney David Addlestone.) Other court-martial defenses in Vietnam raised issues of racism, search and seizure, and command influence (e.g., an attempt by the air force convening authority at Cam Ranh Bay to expel a Navy judge from Vietnam following a ruling adverse to the prosecution). = West Germany (1972‚Äì76) = Year One (1972‚Äì73): Staff ‚Äì Attorneys Howard De Nike (August 1972 ‚Äì August 1973), Robert Rivkin (author of GI Rights and Army Justice [1970]) (October 1972 ‚Äì June 1974); and law student interns (summer 1973) Louis Font and Gale Glazer (each supported by Law Students Civil Rights Research Council and donor Carol Bernstein Ferry).  Significant cases  In October 1973, Robert Rivkin defended soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, West Germany, who had converted to the Sikh religion, against charges of disobeying orders to shave their beards and remove their Sikh turbans. On the basis that the orders violated their religious beliefs, the defense raised objections on First Amendment and Fourth Amendment grounds.Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503 [1986], ruled that First Amendment rights do not apply to military uniforms (per Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a 5‚Äì4 decision). In 1988 through a provision in the annual National Defense Authorization Act, Congress provided a general rule that \\"a member of the armed forces may wear an item of religious apparel while wearing the uniform of the member's armed force.\\" LMDC in West Germany and Washington, D.C. filed and litigated Committee for GI Rights, et al., v.

Significant cases  Attorneys Rivkin and Schaap represented eleven black sailors aboard the U.S.S. Little Rock, flagship of the Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy, charged in an outbreak of racial assaults. As a result of a petition to the U.S. Court of Military Appeals argued by LMDC attorney David Addlestone, the convening authority, Captain Peter Cullins, was disqualified as an interested party, since he was in command of the vessel and intervened personally at the time of the fighting.Brookins v.

Significant cases  Berlin Haircut Trials‚Äì November 1974, LMDC represented a group of Berlin GIs charged with failing to have haircuts meeting military regulations. The cases resulted in widespread publicity and a brief soldiers' strike exposing Army efforts to enforce increased discipline. African-American enlisted person Babbette Peyton was defended at court-martial after she was denied the right to wear her hair in cornrows. In United States v. Hatheway, LMDC urged denial of equal protection in the prosecution of the accused for engaging in homosexual acts on the basis of selective prosecution and a narrowed constitutional test where rights of a minority are at stake.The post-court-martial challenge to Hatheway's conviction by counsel Christopher Coates is found at, Hatheway v. Secretary of the Army, 641 F.2d 1376 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, Hatheway v.

Army spying on LMDC  In the summer of 1973, Army Intelligence branch member SP4 Michael McDougal contacted LMDC with information that its Heidelberg office was the target of Army spying. This disclosure (together with others revealing extensive military surveillance of lawful activities of American civilians in Germany using wire taps, mail covers, infiltration, and dirty tricks) led to scandals described in major American and German media.Cf., e.g., http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41955446.html. The expose is described in a report of the Government Accountability Project at: http://www.avaberlin.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CaseStudyfinalGAP.pdf. As a consequence of the Army's activities, LMDC and other civilians affected filed a federal lawsuit for damages;Berlin Democratic Club v. Rumsfeld, 410 Fed.

Organised by the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches, the event was based on and named after Hands Across America which held a similar event across the continental United States. Reaction to the protest was mixed; with campaign organisers marking the event as a \\"success\\" despite large gaps in areas in England with others including political leaders labeling the event as a \\"publicity stunt\\". Background The event was organised as part of a four- month campaign by the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches to focus attention towards the effects of social, emotional, spiritual and economical effects of unemployment. Other factors included the encouragement of discussion of realistic policies for the reduction in the number of unemployed and an attempt to change the mood from hopelessness and despair to hope and determination within the United Kingdom. The campaign was also aimed to assist with the attention of employers to find talents among the unemployed. Media personality and charity fundraiser Jimmy Savile was named the president of the campaign and it was announced that it would take place on 3 May to coincide with Jobs Day. At the time of the start of official campaigning in January 1987, 11% of people were unemployed in the United Kingdom. Support was garnered from Cardinal Basil Hume, along with more than 60 celebrities which included Glenda Jackson and Sting. Support also came from the political spectrum with the General Secretary of the Union of Communication Workers Alan Tuffin and the General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress Norman Willis. Event Hands Across Britain began after an inaugural service concelebrated by the Archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock, bishop David Sheppard and Free Church of England moderator John Williamson at the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. Archbishop Worlock said that the protest was not political in nature. The chain began at 3:00pm on 3 May 1987 GMT at Hope Street in Liverpool and ended in Downing Street in London. An estimated 250,000 people are believed to have taken part in Hands Across Britain in a human chain that stretched for . This was despite initial figures which suggested around 350,000 people would participate and was mainly down to large gaps in areas such as Staffordshire, Burton-on-Trent, Milton Keynes and Derby where figures stated around 6 to 500 people had joined the human chain in those areas. It was also attributed to inclement weather conditions. Savile broadcast his BBC Radio 1 show from Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire where he highlighted the additional problems that were faced by unemployed disabled people. Reaction Despite the large gaps in areas of England, campaign organiser Molly Meachan said that the demonstration had been a \\"success\\" and was at 10 Downing Street to protest at Unemployment Levels. Unemployed Workers' Charter spokesman Marc Fisher said that Hands Across Britain would be regarded as a \\"publicity stunt\\". Sheppard asserted the issue of unemployment should be a primary concern in that year's general election.

Background  It is not known when Zhang Li was born, but it is known that he was from Fuyang (ÊªèÈôΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei). His male-line ancestors, including his grandfather Zhang Qing () and father Zhang Bao (), had been farmers for generations. (Based on subsequent events, it appeared that Zhang Li's mother was Zhang Bao's wife.) It was said that in Zhang Li's youth, he was studious and capable at writing. Even though he was but a commoner, he would often attend court proceedings whenever he saw people disputing with each other, and make decisions about how he would have ruled had he been the magistrate, as he himself as capable of being an official in the future.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 98.  During Later Tang  Early in the Tongguang era (923-926) of Later Tang's founding emperor Li Cunxu, Zhang Li passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. He was shortly after made a Zuo Shiyi (), a low-level consultant at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), and served as one of the editors of the imperial history. When Li Cunxu's chief of staff (Shumishi) Guo Chongtao was put in actual charge of Later Tang's campaign against its southwestern neighbor Former Shu in 925 (with Li Cunxu's son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei in titular command),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Guo put Zhang in charge of drafting military correspondences. When, after the Later Tang army destroyed Former Shu, Li Jiji killed Guo at the orders of his mother (Li Cunxu's wife) Empress Liu, all of Guo's close associates fled. Only Zhang went to Li Jiji's mansion to mourn Guo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Shortly after, Li Jiji began to lead his army back toward the Later Tang capital Luoyang. However, on the way, the general Li Shaochen rebelled. Li Jiji sent the civilian official Ren Huan, who, despite his civilian background, was capable in military matters, against Li Shaochen. Zhang advised Ren to first send the weakest among his soldiers against Li Shaochen, so that Li Shaochen would be enticed into attacking him, and then lay a trap for Li Shaochen. Ren followed the advice and subsequently defeated Li Shaochen, forcing Li Shaochen to flee to Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan) and try to defend it. Ren subsequently captured the city and took Li Shaochen captive. Li Cunxu then issued an edict ordering Li Shaochen's death, but the eunuch monitor of Li Jiji's army, Li Congxi (), wanted to keep Li Shaochen alive so that he could think of a way to take credit for the victory and deny Ren the credit. Ren hesitated. Zhang spoke to him, arguing that Li Shaochen's crime deserved death, that Li Shaochen would still constitute a potential threat if left alive, and that, in any case, he should not disobey an imperial edict; Zhang also stated that he would execute Li Shaochen himself if Ren did not. Ren agreed (albeit hesitantly) and put Li Shaochen to death. The unjustified executions of Guo and his ally and fellow major general Li Jilin, meanwhile, spawned many rebellions against Li Cunxu throughout the Later Tang realm. In summer 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself, and one of the rebel leaders, his adoptive brother Li Siyuan, subsequently arrived at Luoyang and took over, initially as regent and later claiming the title of emperor. Li Jiji considered battling Li Siyuan, but his soldiers began to abandon him, and he committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Early in Li Siyuan's Tiancheng era (926-930), Li Siyuan, who had previously been impressed with Zhang, commissioned him as an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). When, thereafter, both of his parents died, he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning. After the mourning period, he returned to the imperial government to again serve as imperial scholar. He also successively carried the additional titles of Yuanwailang (Âì°Â§ñÈÉé, low-level official) at both the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu) and ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu), as well as the drafter of edicts. Not long after, his father's long-time concubine died. While she was alive, he had respected her greatly because of the long-term relationship between his father and her, such that his own sons also referred to her as \\"grandmother.\\" After her death, he was unsure whether to observe a mourning period for her, and he requested his colleagues' advice. None had particular advice for him, and he decided to simply request a leave back to Fuyang, where he spent three years (the standard mourning period) not wearing mourning clothes but also not carrying out business. The popular sentiment at the time by those in the know considered his actions on this matter appropriate. During the middle of the Qingtai era (934-936) of Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke, Zhang returned to the imperial government to serve as Bibu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of rites, as well as drafter of edicts and imperial scholar. When Li Congke's brother-in-law (Li Siyuan's son-in-law) Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) rebelled against Li Congke in 936 with support from Later Tang's northern rival, Khitan Empire, one of the generals that Li Congke sent against Shi was another brother-in-law, his chief of staff Zhao Yanshou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. The imperial scholar He Ning was initially assigned to accompany Zhao to serve as his secretary. Zhang, however, was not impressed with He, and volunteered to go instead. Li Congke agreed. Subsequently, however, when both Zhao and his father Zhao Dejun were defeated by Khitan's Emperor Taizong, Zhang and the Zhaos were all captured and taken to Khitan proper. (Li Congke thereafter, finding the situation hopeless, committed suicide, ending Later Tang and allowing Shi's Later Jin to take over its former territory.)  During Liao  Emperor Taizong was impressed with Zhang Li's literary abilities, and he made Zhang an imperial scholar.History of Liao, vol. 76. Around 937, Zhang made an attempt to flee back to Chinese territory, but was captured by the Khitan border guards. Emperor Taizong rebuked him and stated, \\"Why do you abandon me?\\" Zhang responded, \\"Your subject is Chinese. My food and clothing customs are different than yours. Living is worse than dying. I wish to be executed quickly.\\" Instead of punishing Zhang, Emperor Taizong rebuked the interpreter Gao Yanying (), whom he had put in charge of making the lives of the ethnic Han Chinese officials that he had captured comfortable, and whipped Gao. After this incident, Zhang continued to serve Emperor Taizong, and was said to be faithful and honest, speaking straight off his mind without hiding anything. Emperor Taizong thus respected him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Early in Emperor Taizong's Huitong era (938‚Äì947), he was promoted to be chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi) and the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). After Shi Jingtang's death, his nephew and successor Shi Chonggui turned away from a submissive stance toward Khitan (which had, by that point, been renamed Liao), and took a confrontational stance.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. In 946, Emperor Taizong launched a major attack south, and, after defeating and forcing the surrender of the major Later Jin general Du Wei (Shi Jingtang's brother-in-law, Shi Chonggui's uncle), approached the Later Jin capital Kaifeng. Finding the situation hopeless, Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin and allowing (for the time being) Liao to take over its territory. As the Liao army neared Kaifeng, Zhang, who accompanied Emperor Taizong on this campaign south, stated to Emperor Taizong:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong, however, did not listen to this advice. However, after Emperor Taizong entered Kaifeng and claimed to be the emperor of China as well, Zhang and Zhao Yanshou recommended the Later Jin chancellor Li Song, and Emperor Taizong commissioned Li as chief of staff. Zhang himself was subsequently commissioned as You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)), Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the examination bureau), and chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi). (He Ning was also made chancellor at the same time.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. The Liao soldiers mistreated the Chinese of the Central Plains badly, however, and soon the realm was overrun with rebellions. Finding the situation troubling, Emperor Taizong decided to head back to Liao proper, leaving his brother-in-law Xiao Han (the brother of his deceased wife Empress Xiao Wen)in charge of Kaifeng as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (). (According to Xiao later, Zhang opposed Xiao's commission, but was not listened to.) As Emperor Taizong was traversing the devastated Chinese territory on his way back, he stated, \\"What we have rendered China to be is the result of the sins of the Prince of Yan [(i.e., Zhao)].\\" He then turned toward Zhang and stated, \\"You also had a part in it.\\" Emperor Taizong, however, would never reach Liao proper, as he fell ill on the journey and died near Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). His nephew Yel√º Ruan the Prince of Yongkang then claimed imperial title (as Emperor Shizong) (after preemptively arresting Zhao, who had planned to declare himself emperor of China). As Emperor Shizong saw the likelihood that his grandmother (the mother of both Emperor Taizong and his own father Yel√º Bei) would oppose his succession, he took the main Liao army and continued back toward Liao proper, leaving an army at Heng (which Emperor Taizong had designated as the middle capital) as its garrison, along with many Han officials, including Zhang. When Xiao and Emperor Taizong's cousin Yel√º Mada () subsequently withdrew from the Central Plains to Heng as well, they, still bearing grudges over Zhang's suggestion of commissioning only the Han Chinese to rule the Han Chinese, had their soldiers surround Zhang's mansion. At that time, Zhang was already ill, but he came out to meet Xiao and Yel√º Mada. Xiao rebuked him, stating: Xiao locked Zhang's arms in chains, but Zhang responded harshly, \\"These are about the important matters of the state. I did in fact say these things. Kill me if you wish. What is the point of locking me?\\" Yel√º Mada, however, believed that even officials as honored as Zhang could not be killed so frivolously, and therefore insisted on sparing Zhang. Xiao then released Zhang. Nevertheless, Zhang died in anger and distress that night. It was said that because Zhang often spoke righteously and had mercy on those who had talents, and he was willing to praise others for their good deeds and spend his wealth to help the poor, the Chinese scholars of the Central Plains, upon hearing of his death, mourned him. His family members burned his body and returned the bones to Fuyang for burial.

History  The need for a fortification, preventing access to Rome through its south-west side, derived from a conflict between two noble Roman families, the Barberini (the house of the Pontiff) and the Farnese, due to economic interests and to the policy of expansion of the former against the latter. The casus belli, cleverly arranged by Urban VIII himself, was the failure to pay to Barberinis the economic rents of the Duchy of Castro and Ronciglione (now in the Province of Viterbo), governed by Odoardo I Farnese, the Duke of Parma and Piacenza and supported by Venice, the France of Richelieu and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In the summer of 1641 the Pope himself, leading an army of 15.000 men with artilleries, marched against the Duchy, occupying its territory and the town of Castro: in effect, the economic interests concealed political matters, as well as a kind of feud between rival families, and Urban was waiting for nothing but a pretext to set off the spark. The ‚ÄúWar of Castro‚Äù, because of the involved powers, could however pose a threat also to the Holy See, the Barberini House and its properties in Rome. The town, though adequately protected, was nevertheless perilously exposed on the side of Janiculum (what's more, too close to the Vatican): on this side, the former wall erected by Emperor Aurelian was no more in condition to guarantee an effective protection. The work was commissioned to Marcantonio De Rossi, a quite unknown architect, whose appointment was probably thanks to his friendship with the powerful Olimpia Maidalchini. The surveys began in 1641, the building at the end of the following year and in 1643 the work was completed. The new wall, rising on the west side of Janiculum, had serious consequences on the former defensive structures; in particular, the whole stretch of the Aurelian walls on that side of the river was demolished, as it rose within the new perimeter. For the same reason, the bastion of the Leonine wall, built by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger close to Porta Santo Spirito, as well as the Porta itself, were by now almost useless; Porta Settimiana became useless as well, while Porta Portuensis, closed off the new wall, was demolished together with the Aurelian stretch and replaced with the new Porta Portese northward. The only structure that maintained its function was Porta San Pancrazio, where the new wall almost coincided to the ancient Aurelian structure.To be more precise, the new gate was a few meters away from the former one. Porta Portese Finally, in the new wall only a gate was built from scratch. Completed in 1644, Porta Portese shows the coat of arms of Pope Innocent X, the successor of Urban VIII, who had died in the meanwhile. From here, with a backward lengthening of the former street, starts the Via Portuensis, that until then sprouted from Porta Portuensis, just south. Despite the fears of Urban, the wall had to face no serious threat for two centuries, until in 1849 it became one of the main scenes of the fights between the French army of the General Oudinot (helping the Pope, who was about to lose the temporal power over the city) and the militias of the 2nd Roman Republic. The first tangle, on April 29, 1849, took place at the crossing between ancient and new Via Aurelia; the next day the French troops advanced towards Porta Angelica and Porta Cavalleggeri but, along the whole way up to Porta San Pancrazio, the defenders, sheltered behind the wallsm seriously impeded the Frenchmen: the bayonet fitting and then the standoff of the troops led by Garibaldi in the area of the Basilica of San Pancrazio forced the assailants to beat a retreat. The second fight, in the same area of Villa Pamphilj and Porta San Pancrazio, began during the night between 2 and 3 June. After a battle lasted the whole day, with continuous turn-arounds and a very high death toll on both sides, the Frenchmen gained the upper hand, but the walls held up and the defenders didn't cede. However, the walls of Urban had been built to resist the 17th-century artillery and, two centuries after, the firepower was quite different: indeed, after making eight breaches in the walls to the left of Porta San Pancrazio and destroying the Porta itself, during the night between 21 and 22 June the Frenchmen overlooked the walls. The desperate standoff in the whole area kept them stuck until 30 June, when the armistice was signed. On 3 July they entered Rome. The signs of the later reconstruction of the wall are still visible, especially in the stretch that flanks Viale delle Mura Gianicolensi, before the crossing with Via Fratelli Bonnet (but also beyond): Pope Pius IX, as soon as he had strengthened his own position, quickly reconstructed the stretch of wall that had been damaged, as shown by some plates. The same area on the left of Porta San Pancrazio was the scene of another fight, on September 20, 1870, between the troops of General Nino Bixio and the papal defenders; but the Bersaglieri entered Porta Pia at the same time, and the papal troops gave up before the artilleries could destroy the wall again.  The layout  Villa Sciarra: the walk along the walls The area of Porta Portese, just a few meters from the present Ponte Sublicio, is the lowest of the whole layout: the rise to the Janiculum hill begins soon beyond, partly due to the raising of the ground level. Between the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century, the whole area became the centre of various settlements relevant to river transports: just within the gate rose the Port of Ripa Grande, that was the main dock of the Tiber, in front of the ancient Emporium, while just outside, in 1714, Pope Clement XI built the new ‚ÄúPapal Arsenal‚Äù, used for the maintenance of the river commercial fleet of the Pope; the Arsenal operated until the end of the 19th century, when the building of the muraglioni (embankments) of the Tiber interrupted any activity related to the river. The only surviving memory of the Port are two ramps descending to the river. After a short stretch north-westward, the wall makes a right angle southwest and goes on in a non-linear way flanking Viale delle Mura Portuensi up to Largo Bernardino da Feltre, just where probably it crossed the ancient Aurelian layout. Three coats of arm of Urban VIII are visible along this stretch, where the wall is not particularly high due to the raising of the ground level: they were placed in 1644, when the Pope had already died. Obviously nothing is left of the bastion that rose where Viale Trastevere - opened during the kingdom of Umberto I - now runs; the wall is again visible, though quite degraded, along the rise of Viale Aurelio Saffi, on the right. In correspondence to the first curve on the left there is a tunnel dug under the wall, used as an air-raid shelter during war period. The wall goes on climbing and, in correspondence to the last, narrow curve of Viale Saffi, a blind arch is visible, probably used as a tunnel to pass on the other side. After a further, short stretch southward, the wall suddenly turns right, always flanking the street, that now changes its name into Viale delle Mura Gianicolensi. At the corner there is a quite battered plate, in memory of the works of restoration: ‚ÄúPIUS IX PONTIFEX MAXIMUS PROPUGNACULUM INNOCENTIO X P M EXTRUCTUM ANGULIS PRORUENTIS LABE[‚Ä¶] FATISCENS NOVA MOLITIONE A FUNDAMENTIS RESTITUTUS IUSSIT ANNO MDCCCLXI IOSEPHO FERRARI PREF. AER.‚Äù Next to the plate, a plaque ‚ÄúS.P.Q.R. MDCCCXLIX‚Äù remembers the events of 1849. Furthermore, the entire stretch of wall from here up to Porta San Pancrazio is a sequence of signs, more or less visible, of restorations (patchings, traces of subsidences and collapses), that evidently lasted at least until 1861, according to the just mentioned plate of Pope Pius IX. All along this first stretch, up to the crossing with Via Fratelli Bonnet, the inner side of the wall encircles the area of Villa Sciarra and is only partially visible since, in some places, it is covered by an embankment giving a modern example of the ancient agger, probably similar to the one next to the Servian Wall. About halfway, there is an open postern, serving as a secondary access to Villa Sciarra. Passing through this access gives an idea of the outstanding thickness of the base of the wall. The stretch, starting soon after the two modern arches on Via Fratelli Bonnet allowing the viability, is the one most damaged by the military events of 1848, commemorated by two plates newly restored, placed just where a sizeable breach was opened. The first plate was placed by the Pope soon after the first restorations and is combined with the three coats of arms of the Odescalchi and Mastai-Ferretti families and of the Municipality of Rome: ‚ÄúAN.

Presently the gate rises isolated in order to ease viability. The following downhill stretch shows completely different characteristics, as regards both history (it has suffered no damages from bombings and assaults) and landscape (the quite steep slope didn't allow a building growth in the close vicinity). Viale delle Mura Aurelie follows the wall in a quite winding way, according to the profile of the walls and bastions. After bypassing the first bastion, the wall shows a travertine aedicula, in a quite elevated position, containing a statue of St. Andrew. According to the plate, this is the place where the head of the Saint, held within St. Peter's Basilica since the 15th century, was discovered after being abandoned by the thief that had purloined it:In 1964 Pope Paul VI returned the relic to the town of Patras, the hometown of the Apostle, as a sign of d√©tente between Latin and greek Orthodox Churches. ‚ÄúANDREAE APOSTOLO URBIS SOSPITATORI PIUS IX PONT MAX HIC UBI CAPUT EIUS FURTO ABLATUM REPERIT MONUMENTUM REI AUSPICATISS.

All along this last stretch - not particularly interesting anyway - 12 coats of arms of Urban VIII and 3 of Pius IX are scattered; in the section corresponding to the square that houses the monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi there is a walled-in and quite recessed postern; a plate in remembrance of the restoration works carried up in 1849 in the area of Porta San Pancrazio and two further plates in remembrance of as many further restorations by Pius IX; the first one, dated 1857, is not easily readable: \\"PROVIDENTIA PII IX PONT MAX URBIS MOENIA A PORTA NOVA PANCRATII HIEROMARTYRIS AD PORTAM PETRI APOSTOLI PRINCIPIS MONTIS IMPENDENTIS ALTITUDINE AC TEMPORIS INIURIA FATISCENTIA JOSEPHUS FERRARI ANTIST.

The band are notable for their political lyrics. History Red Monkey was formed by Rachel Holborow, Pete Dale and Marc Walker in 1996, following on from Rachel and Pete‚Äôs earlier bands, the riot grrrl four-piece Pussycat Trash, and lo-fi duo Avocado Baby. Both acts had released records on the duo‚Äôs own record label Slampt, based in their adopted home town of Newcastle. Marc had previously drummed for Newcastle-based Post Hardcore/Rock bands Spinach and Kodiak. Red Monkey‚Äôs first release was the \\"Do What You Feel\\" EP on Slampt, followed by \\"The Time Is Right\\" EP on US label Troubleman Unlimited and then their debut album Make The Moment. Allmusic praised the album for its \\"melodic appeal\\" and the band‚Äôs \\"ability to make entirely political lyrics work in a personal, intelligent manner\\", while the group‚Äôs sound was compared to Gang of Four. In 1998, the band toured the US to support the stateside release of the album, and a third single followed on Kill Rock Stars records, including two tracks performed on the band‚Äôs Peel Session earlier the same year. Tours of Ireland and Europe followed before the band recorded their second album Difficult Is Easy, released in 1999. The record received more mixed reviews than the first; it was praised by the NME but Popmatters criticised the album for failing to capture the live energy of the band, albeit while making favourable comparisons to both Minutemen and Fugazi, the latter of whom Red Monkey supported on their American tours. Third and final album Gunpowder, Treason and Plot was released in 2001 on Troubleman Unlimited, after Slampt records was wound down the previous year. Joe Mask (of Leeds group Bilge Pump) joined the band on second guitar. The album was praised as a return to form and noted for the use of non-standard time signatures, as well as horns, which brought comparisons to The Ex. From 2001, the band was less active as members focused increasingly on their families and careers. A final split single with Erase Errata was released in 2003 and the band played their last shows in 2005. Dale started work as a music teacher, and later as a lecturer at Oxford Brookes University, while continuing to play in long term side project Milky Wimpshake and also, immediately following Red Monkey, in a band called Chronicity. Marc Walker and Rachel Holborow went on to play in The Guise and Do The Right Thing, respectively. Red Monkey reformed for a night to play a Slampt Records retrospective event in Newcastle in 2008, alongside a new generation of post riot-grrrl bands which they and their label helped influence. They continue to be invoked as a touchstone for bands up to the present day. In 2014, Berlin-based label Our Voltage released a Red Monkey singles and rarities compilation, calling it \\"posthumous post-punk.. by one of England‚Äôs finest Post-RiotGrrrl-Outfits\\". Reception The band have been notated for their overt left-leaning political lyrics. Allmusic acclaimed the political agenda of the group, describing it as \\"down with materialist culture, up with self-actualization\\". Chris Nelson, writing for MTV in 1998, noted the group's lyrics and \\"jagged\\" sound. He added that the three members had \\"... distinct voices moving forward as one.\\" Discography =Singles and EPs= * Do What You Feel (Feel What You Do), EP, 1997 (Slampt, UK) * The Time Is Right, EP, 1997 (Troubleman Unlimited, USA) * Mailorder Freak 7‚Äù Singles Club, EP, 1998 (Kill Rock Stars, USA) * \\"Get Uncivilised\\", single, 2000 (Troubleman Unlimited) * (Split single with Submission Hold) 7‚Äù, 2000 (Radio One, Australia) * (Split single with Erase Errata) 7‚Äù, 2003 (Gringo Records, UK) =Albums= * Make The Moment, 1997 (Slampt/Troubleman Unlimited) * Difficult Is Easy, 1999 (Slampt/Troubleman Unlimited) * Gunpowder, Treason and Plot, 2001 (Troubleman Unlimited) * How We Learned To Live Like A Bomb, 2014 (Our Voltage) =Compilation appearances= * Taking A Chance On Chances LP, 1998 (Slampt/Troubleman Unlimited) References Further reading * Punk and the Politics of Empowerment, Pete Dale (2010) * DIY Queer Feminist (Sub)cultural Resistance in the UK, Julia Downes (2009) External links * 2002 interview * 2006 retrospective * 2014 retrospective interview British post-hardcore musical groups Riot grrrl bands Music and politics Underground punk scene in the United Kingdom ","title":"Red Monkey (band)"},{"id":"42439376","text":"Eden is a 2014 French drama film directed by Mia Hansen-L√∏ve and co-written with Sven Hansen-L√∏ve.

He hopes they can romantically reconnect but she informs Paul that she once had an abortion after becoming pregnant with his child. Paul has a nervous breakdown and confesses to his mother that he is addicted to cocaine and is deeply in debt. By 2013 Paul has managed to rehabilitate his life and works for a vacuum repair company by day while attending a creative writing workshop by night. At one of the workshop sessions he talks to a young girl who asks him what he does. When he tells her he is a former DJ who specialized in garage music she admits that the only techno she listens to is Daft Punk. Later Paul goes to a club where he sees Guy-Man and Thomas again.

The film is loosely based on Mia Hansen-L√∏ve's brother Sven's life. In addition to being the inspiration behind the film he also co-wrote the script. The film took three years to be produced in part because obtaining the rights to the music was so expensive. Hansen-L√∏ve went through two different producers over the course of the pre-production process and was only able to obtain the necessary rights to license the music after Daft Punk agreed to license their music for the lowest possible fee causing other musicians to join them. Filming began in November 2013 and was completed on 31 January 2014. Reception Eden received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 84% based on 97 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus statement reads, \\"Eden uses 1990s club culture as the appropriately intoxicating backdrop for a sensitive, low-key look at aging and the price of pursuing one's dreams.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" On Guardian's \\"The 100 best films of the 21st century\\" list, Eden is ranked 90th.

Genre  Published in 2011 by Tyndale House, a Christian press based in Illinois, A Heart for Freedom is categorized under Chai Ling, Biography, and China- Politics and government. HC:.  Synopsis  Chai Ling is the oldest daughter of a military doctor from Rizhao, a fishing village in Shandong province known as the ‚ÄúCity of Sunshine.‚ÄùLing Chai, A Heart for Freedom. Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale House, 2011. , 3. She became independent and started taking care of her younger siblings at a very early age.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 15. Chai wrote that she was deeply influenced by her parents, who believed that knowledge was the key to success, as well as by her traditional grandmother,Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 5. who survived famine. Chai worked to secure one of the five permitted spots for Peking University (Beida) in her province,Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 7. and achieved the family goal of ‚Äúgoing to Beijing.‚Äù Chai's family considered admission to Peking University the key to success and a guaranteed stable life, whereas Chai herself considered college a gateway to freedom, happinessLing Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 8. and even a reform of her motherland. After entering Beida, Chai witnessed and experienced a series of troubling events, which shaped her view on the rule of the CCP as problematic, which all contributed to Chai's resolve to participate and later take a leadership role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The incidents included Chai being informed that her mother back home was accused by colleagues of stealing two expensive microscopes to exchange for her daughter's tuition,Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 73. her three abortions, which Chai attributed to her ignorance about sex and birth control,Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 79. and ‚Äúrumours‚Äù being spread in attempt to ruin her reputation after an attempted rape.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 57. Under the influence of her husband Feng Congde, Chai joined the leadership of the student movement after the former CCP party chief Hu Yaobang‚Äôs funeral was held.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 151. She became the only woman among the student leaders, and organized the hunger strike in response to the rejection of dialogue by the CCP.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 131. The hunger strike pushed the protest to a new high, with unprecedented numbers of students participating in protests ranging from fasting to marching. During the hunger strike, Chai turned to a Hong Kong based reporter named Philip Cunningham to record her experience and thoughts about the movement. She claimed that she put total trust in Cunningham without knowing who he was.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 175. Chai claims that the videotape was later released to the public without her approval in the documentary Gate of Heavenly Peace, which Chai believed was selectively edited and generated false assumptions about her intentions and actions. According to Chai, the documentary suggested she ‚Äúexposed her student followers to bloodshed and death‚Äù and ‚Äúminimized the fact that she stayed until the last hour‚Äù in the protests.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 178. Chai recalled that after the CCP announced the imposition of martial law, intense disagreement over staying or leaving the square and a shift of intentions among student leaders put her into a dilemma, but she finally decided to call for an evacuation of the square when PLA troops advanced.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 191. Chai claims that infantry, tank crewmen and machine guns were shooting randomly at the unarmed citizens in the square; thousands of innocent lives were sacrificed as the price of showing up in the square on the night of June 4, 1989.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 192. The CCP labeled her a ‚Äúcounterrevolutionary rioter‚Äù and the most-wanted female fugitive after the protest was violently crushed.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 212. In the third part of the book, Chai details her life after the Tiananmen crackdown. These milestones included her escape to the United States via Hong Kong and France, her the separation from Feng Congde due to his abusive behavior,Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 235. her adapting to a new culture, the education she received at Princeton and Harvard under a scholarship, and her marriage with Bob Maginn. She also portrays her successful establishment of her own start-up ‚Äì a turnkey intranet portal and learning management system for universities, known as Jenzabar.com.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 270. Chai describes how she became a devoted Christian and continued her pursuit of democracy in China shortly after the twentieth anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 278. She drew attention to China's one child policy and introduced the All Girls Allowed Foundation, in response to the gender-selective forced abortion and rise of sexual trafficking due to gender imbalance.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 295. Chai writes that she now believes that the Tiananmen Massacre was God's plan to reveal the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, and the transformation to a Jesus-following nation is the key to reaching democracy for China.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 326. Chai concludes by urging readers to invite Jesus into their lives.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom, 331.  Reception  One critic of the book, author Eddie Cheng, suggested that Chai was judgmental and subjective about others in the democracy movement. Cheng doubted the accuracy and trustworthiness of the memoir, describing it as selective description of the truth. Cheng also believes A Heart for Freedom ‚Äúlacks details, depth, and accuracy to be a valuable historical account.‚ÄùEddie Cheng, January 29, 2012 (6:11PM), \\"A Life In Drift: Review of Chai Ling's Autobiography,\\" Standoff At Tiananmen, http://www.standoffattiananmen.com/2012/01/life-in-drift-review-of- chai-lings.html .

In computer science, a finger search on a data structure is an extension of any search operation that structure supports, where a reference (finger) to an element in the data structure is given along with the query. While the search time for an element is most frequently expressed as a function of the number of elements in a data structure, finger search times are a function of the distance between the element and the finger. In a set of n elements, the distance d(x,y) (or simply d when unambiguous) between two elements x and y is their difference in rank. If x and y are the ith and jth largest elements in the structure, then the difference in rank is |i - j|. If a normal search in some structure would normally take O(f(n)) time, then a finger search for x with finger y should ideally take O(f(d)) time. Remark that since d ‚â§ n, it follows that in the worst case, finger search is only as bad as normal search. However, in practice these degenerate finger searches do more work than normal searches. For instance, if f(n) is log(n), and finger search does twice as many comparisons as normal search in the worst case, it follows that finger search is slower when d > . Therefore, finger search should only be used when one can reasonably expect the target to actually be close to the finger. Implementations Some popular data structures support finger search with no additional changes to the actual structure. In structures where searching for an element x is accomplished by narrowing down an interval over which x can be found, finger search from y is typically accomplished by reversing the search process from y until the search interval is large enough to contain x, at which point search proceeds as normal. =Sorted linked lists= In a linked list, one normally searches linearly for an element by walking from one end to the other. If the linked list is sorted, and we have a reference to some node containing y, then we may find x in O(d) time by starting our search from y. =Sorted arrays= In a sorted array A, one normally searches for an element x in A with a binary search. Finger search is accomplished by performing a one-sided search from A[j] = y. While binary search halves the search space after each comparison, one-sided search doubles the search space after each comparison. Specifically, on the kth iteration of one-sided search (assuming x > y), the interval under consideration is A[j, j+2k-1]. Expansion halts as soon as A[j + 2k-1] ‚â• x, at which point this interval is binary searched for x. If one-sided search takes k iterations to find an interval that contains x, then it follows that d > 2k-2. Binary searching this range will also take another k iterations. Therefore, finger search for x from y takes O(k) = O(log d) time. =Skip lists= In a skip list, one can finger search for x from a node containing the element y by simply continuing the search from this point. Note that if x < y, then search proceeds backwards, and if x > y, then search proceeds forwards. The backwards case is symmetric to normal search in a skip list, but the forward case is actually more complex. Normally, search in a skiplist is expected to be fast because the sentinel at the start of the list is as tall as the tallest node. However, our finger could be a node of height 1. Because of this, we may occasionally climb while trying to search; something which never occurs normally. However, even with this complication, we can achieve O(log d) expected search time. =Treaps= A treap is a randomized binary search tree (BST). Searching in a treap is the same as searching for an element in any other BST. Treaps however have the property that the expected path length between two elements of distance d is O(log d). Thus, to finger search from the node containing y for x, one can climb the tree from y until an ancestor of x is found, at which point normal BST search proceeds as usual. While determining if a node is the ancestor of another is non-trivial, one may augment the tree to support queries of this form to give expected O(log d) finger search time. = Ropes and trees = Implementations of the rope (data structure) typically implement a cord position iterator to traverse the string. The iterator can be seen as a finger that points at some specific character of the string. Like most balanced trees, ropes require O(log(n)) time to retrieve data in one leaf of the tree when given only the root of the tree. Reading every leaf of the tree would seem to require O(n*log(n)) time. However, by storing a little extra information, the iterator can be used to read \\"the next\\" leaf in only O(1) time, and every leaf of a tree in only O(n) time. Implementions of ropes typically cache \\"extra information\\" about the entire the path from the root to the current node position in the iterator. Other implementations of tree data structures sometimes store \\"extra information\\" in the tree itself, storing a pointer in each node to its parent or its successor (in addition to the normal pointers in each node to its children), and storing only the current node position in the iterator. \\"General design concerns for a tree iterator\\". Steven J. Zeil. \\"Traversing Trees with Iterators\\". Generalizations If one can perform finger search in an iterative manner in O(f(d)) time, where each iteration takes O(1) time, then by providing c different fingers, one can perform finger search in O(c min{d(x, y1), ..., d(x, yc)}) time. This is accomplished by starting finger search for all c fingers, and iterating them forward one step each until the first one terminates. Given any sequence A = [a1, ..., am] of m accesses, a structure is said to have the static finger property for a fixed finger f, if the time to perform A is O\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\\\log d(f,a_i)\\\\right). Splay trees have this property for any choice of f with no additional processing on sufficiently large sequences of accesses. Applications Finger search can be used to re-use work already done in previous searches. For instance, one way to iterate over the elements in a data structure is to simply finger search for them in order, where the finger for one query is the location of the result of the last. One may optimize their data structure by doing this internally if it is known that searches are frequently near the last search. A finger search tree is a type of data structure that allows fingers to be specified such that all or some of their supported operations are faster when they access or modify a location near a finger. In contrast to the finger searches described in this article, these fingers are not provided at query time, but are separately specified so that all future operations use these fingers. One benefit of this is that the user needs not manipulate or store internal references to the structure, they may simply specify an element in the structure.

At the 8th Academy Awards, the ‚ÄúStraw Hat‚Äù number, choreographed byDave Gould, won the short-lived Academy Award for Best Dance Direction, sharing the honor with ‚ÄúI've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'‚Äù from Broadway Melody of 1936. The film, based on the 1934 play The Red Cat by Rudolph Lothar and Hans Adler, is a story of mistaken identity, with Maurice Chevalier playing both a music-hall star and a business tycoon who resembles him. This was Chevalier‚Äôs last film in Hollywood for twenty years, and reprised familiar themes such as the straw hat and a rendering of the French song \\"Valentine\\".L‚Äôhomme des Folies Bergere, according to Chevalier by Gene Ringgold and DeWitt Bodeen, published in 1973 by The Citadel Press, Secaucus, New Jersey, (p 130-135). This is also the last film to be distributed by Twentieth Century Pictures before it merged with Fox Film in 1935 to form 20th Century Fox. Zanuck simultaneously produced a French- language version of the story, also directed by Roy Del Ruth, called L'homme des Folies Berg√®re. It stars Chevalier and Natalie Paley and Sim Viva. Because that film was intended for the French market, they shot scenes showing chorus girls bare breasted. When censor Joseph Breen heard of it, he insisted that the Production Code be enforced even in a film destined for another country. The American Film Institute catalog site describes Zanuck's losing battle with the censors. The Red Cat, which was produced for the Broadway stage by Zanuck, ran for only 13 performances, but the studio benefited from four film adaptations. The third and fourth were in Technicolor. On the Riviera (1951), directed by Walter Lang, stars Danny Kaye, Gene Tierney and Corinne Calvet. Irving Cummings directed the 1941 adaptation, That Night in Rio, which stars Don Ameche, Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda.

The skeleton was seized from the institute by the federal government, followed by a 10-year-long battle with the FBI, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Maurice Williams, the landowner on whose property the bones were discovered. Pete Larson also spent 18 months in prison, on unrelated charges of international money laundering and trading fossils on the black market. Reception The film received positive response from critics. Dennis Harvey, in his review for Variety, called the documentary \\"engrossing\\". Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film positive review and said that it involves a \\"story of scientific discovery and petty politics\\". Eric Kohn from Indiewire in his review said that \\"A subset of the recent scientific-documentary-as-thriller tradition epitomized by The Cove and Blackfish, Todd Douglas Miller's Dinosaur 13 is both awe-inspiring and tragic.\\" After the film aired, The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, a society of professional paleontologists that depend largely on government grants for research, issued a statement of full support for legally protecting fossils on public land and criticized Dinosaur 13 for implying that government ownership of fossil specimens impedes paleontological science.

ASSET works with think tanks, elected officials and lobbyists on Capitol Hill to bring about an option that would change the existing estate tax laws.  History  The group was founded in 2010 by Jack Fitzgerald, an entrepreneur and chairman of a chain of dealerships called Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which is based in Kensington, Maryland. Fitzgerald created ASSET after building a network of active car dealerships after the 2009 bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler. ASSET has conducted meetings and briefings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in addition to two major studies on what they claim to be the economic benefits of the ASSET proposal to change the collection method for the estate tax. ASSET advocates for a collection of state tax revenues for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Fitzgerald's original plan called for eliminating the estate tax upon death and instead enacting an annual 1.77% surcharge on the adjusted gross income of the wealthiest 1% of the population. The group claims that the IRS would achieve the same amount of annual revenue that the IRS receives from the collection of the estate tax. In 2013, the ASSET proposal was changed to an entirely voluntary system in which taxpayers would opt-in to pay a 1% surcharge on annual income while they are alive and no estate tax would be owed upon their death, but for capital gains on inherited assets. The group claims that their proposal for estate tax reform would eliminate the need for sheltering assets in unproductive trusts to avoid the tax as well as the need to over-purchase life insurance, which they say diverts resources away from investment and job creation. The proposal by ASSET has been guided by Rep. Steny Hoyer, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, and Senator Ben Cardin in Maryland. In late September 2013, ASSET hosted a discussion panel on the estate tax that was moderated by Tax Foundation President Scott Hodge, with panelists Grover Norquist from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), Chuck Marr from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, and former Senator Bob Bennett (R-UT). At the panel, Bennett stated that ASSET's plan for reforming the estate tax offered the best solution for all worlds, saying that it offered a voluntary collection method and did not force itself upon the taxpayers. Also at the panel, Norquist, who is an advocate for full repeal of the estate tax, added that he approved of ASSET's proposal, and that it should be part of the discussion on estate tax reform. In April 2014, ASSET called on the federal Ways and Means Committee to include estate tax reform as a part of a more comprehensive reform effort. On Thursday, December 11, 2014, Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) introduced the American Solution for Simplifying the Estate Tax Act, or ‚ÄòASSET Act', of 2014 (H.R. 5872).https://www.congress.gov/congressional- record/2014/12/12/extensions-of-remarks- section/article/e1807-2/?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Estate%22%5D%7D The bill was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives in the 113th Congress and has since been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5872  Structure  ASSET is a 501 (c)(4) non-profit organization, which was founded in 2010 in order to advocate for a change in the collection method for the federal estate tax. Fitzgerald remains in the role of chairman of ASSET. In 2011, ASSET hired former U.S. Representative Phil English, a Pennsylvania Republican who was a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, as a lobbyist.http://www.autonews.com/article/20110122/RETAIL07/110129954?template=printart The day-to-day functions and activities conducted by ASSET are led by its President, Rob Smith, and Jordan Silverman, a former researcher at Adventist HealthCare who joined in 2014.  The ASSET proposal  Under the ASSET proposal the value of an estate is determined by economic and market conditions. Death is not treated as an economic event as it is under current federal tax law. The ASSET proposal eliminates death as a taxable event by allowing individuals to make what the group describes as a down payment on their estate taxes during their earning years. The assets in these individuals' estates would later be taxed at the capital gains rate at the time of the actual sale, regardless of how long the individual has been deceased. This program would be completely voluntary and therefore would not involve a new tax being imposed by the United States Congress. Those taxpayers who opt in to the ASSET plan would pay surcharge on their annual income while they are alive and no estate tax would be assessed once they have died, only when an heir sells an asset. Diana Furchgott-Roth, former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, mentioned the ASSET proposal as one to be considered when discussing estate tax reform. She said that state taxes levied on family farms and businesses could necessitate the sale of those entities to pay the tax, so changing the timing of taxation would enable families to pass their business on rather than sell.http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/69st0775.pdf Since 2000, high earners in the U.S. have been able to avoid an estimated $100 billion in gift (taxes) and estate taxes through tax code loopholes. ASSET claims that their plan would eliminate loopholes in the current estate tax code, as well as the need for wealthy taxpayers to shelter their assets in trusts to avoid estate taxes upon death. By eliminating incentives for the high earners to hide assets from the IRS through unproductive tax avoidance schemes, ASSET says that such individuals will therefore have to contribute their fair share of taxes to the U.S. Treasury. The group says that its plan is revenue neutral, and described it as permanent solution to the problems of the current estate tax collection method. The group asserts that the proposal would cost the taxpayers nothing.

He belonged to a prominent landowning family in Devon, who gave their name to the manor of Bowringsleigh. His main estate was at nearby West Alvington, and he also acquired lands in Somerset and Gloucestershire. He was a member of the Middle Temple, and had the reputation of being a fine lawyer. He served as a commissioner for the peace in his native county between 1481 and 1487. In 1494 the temporary downfall of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, who for many years had been almost all-powerful in Ireland, led to the dismissal en masse of the Irish High Court judges, who were regarded by the Crown as being Kildare's puppets, and whose loyalty to the Crown was doubtful (with good reason, as several of them had been pardoned six years earlier for supporting the claim of the pretender Lambert Simnel to the English throne). They were replaced by eminent English lawyers, in whose loyalty the English Crown believed that it could place its trust. Bowring was sent to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice. Two years later he exchanged this place for the less onerous office of Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Soon afterwards, the Earl of Kildare was restored to royal favour and was once more allowed to have his \\"own men\\" appointed to judicial office. Bowring resigned from the Irish Bench and returned to Devon, where he continued to serve in various official capacities until his death in 1504. He was married twice, and by his first wife had three children: *Robert (died 1514), MP for Plymouth; *Ralph, who inherited the family estates after the death of Robert's only daughter; *Alice, who married William Pyke.

After three years, she became the first female Bus Dispatcher, and was eventually promoted to manager of Special Service charter buses.

He is also a set and costume designer for theater and film. Soto studied at Escuela Nacional de Arte National Art Schools (Cuba) and Instituto Superior de Arte, University of Havana. As an educator he has taught and lectured at various Higher Education institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Soto also founded a creative workshop, El Tesoro de Tamulte, in Tabasco, Mexico, from which professional artists emerged.https://www.worldcat.org/title/tesoro-de-tamulte-arte-desde-el- tropico/oclc/58678600 Biography Soto was born and grew up in the city of Cienfuegos, Cuba. Soto was one of the leading figures of the influential ‚ÄúVolumen Uno‚Äù, an artistic movement that changed the course of Cuban Art in the decade of the 1980s, in which he was the first artist in his generation to work with the Afro-Cuban heritage. He is also credited for being the first performance and installation artist on the island. In his performances and the visual/installation art which emerge from his performances, Soto responds to the postmodern coordinates of implosion and satire, often subverting the inceptions of culturally accepted notions of high/kitsch, traditional/pop, global/local, and profane/sacred art forms. Throughout his artistic career, he has demonstrated an interest in religion, ritual, and the mythology of indigenous people.Blanc, Giulio, \\"Review on Leandro Soto\\", Miami: Art Nexus, October 1994, pp 108-9  Selected solo exhibitions  *2018 Cr√≥nicas visuales.

Daoust obtained a bachelor of arts degree from the Universit√© de Montr√©al, a bachelor of business administration from the √âcole des hautes √©tudes commerciales de Montr√©al, and a master of business administration from Universit√© Laval. Prior to his election to the legislature, Daoust was the executive director of Investissement Qu√©bec, the province's business development agency. Daoust was appointed to cabinet as minister of the economy in April 2014. Under Daoust, the government aided Bombardier by investing $1 billion in the Quebec multinational to help it develop the CSeries aircraft, a decision that was criticized by the public. Daoust was also economy minister when Quebec hardware chain Rona was sold to American investors. Daoust occupied that position until 2016. After a cabinet shuffle by Premier Philippe Couillard, Daoust became transport minister, when incumbent Robert Po√´ti returned to the back benches. During his time in the transport portfolio, Daoust presided over the penetration of Uber into Quebec and its negative impact on the province's taxi industry. That led to Daoust resigning in August 2016. Daoust, a native of Verdun, QC, died after suffering a stroke. He was 69 years old.

It was released on 5 November 2013. Plot After the events of Prodigy, Daniel \\"Day\\" Altan Wing now lives as a free citizen in San Francisco with his younger brother, Eden Bataar. Following several months of no communication, Day is contacted by June Iparis about a \\"feast\\" held by Anden Stavropoulos, the young Elector of the Republic. In reality, Anden wants Day to hand over Eden as part of the Republic's search for a cure for their virus, wreaking havoc upon the Colonies, causing the latter to give an ultimatum for the cure, lest they and Africa will invade the Republic. Day denies the request and the Republic's cause is further eroded when traitor soldiers Thomas Bryant and Commander Jameson, both in death row for the attempted coup, escape. The next day, Day collapses due to his illness and is rushed to the hospital. The following day, Day tells June about his terminal illness, just before the city is attacked by the Colonies' airships. While the population is being evacuated to Los Angeles, Day works with the Patriot organization to hijack the Colonies' airships. During the event, Thomas sacrifices himself to save Day. Day is sent to the Los Angeles Central Hospital due to another illness flare-up and is contacted by the Chancellor of the Colonies, who blackmails him into defecting to the Colonies and convincing the masses to do so, or else he will kill June and Eden if the Colonies win. He gives him three days to decide. Day instead spreads messages through graffiti to make the Republic's population support Anden. He also reluctantly decides to let Eden become a test subject to find a cure for biological diseases spreading in the Colonies. Meanwhile, June accompanies Anden to meet with the President of Antarctica to request help for the war. The President refuses, stating that the Republic was infested with disease, and that he would aid Anden only if a cure was found along with several plots of land as payment. The Colonies has conquered Denver and are now landing their airships near the harbor. Day meets with the Chancellor to give an answer for the blackmail: no. He escapes as the Colonies attack Los Angeles. With the war ensuing in the streets, June speeds up the search for the cure when she offers her blood to be tested, as she realizes that she is the missing link required to patch up Eden. Once the testing is done, she assists the Republic. She confronts Jameson, who has shot Day, and lets her get shot by a Republic soldier. Day almost dies of blood loss. Later, June learns Day has survived, but has lost all memory of the events of the previous year and does not remember June. She lets him go, believing he will be happier without remembering the grief she caused him. In the epilogue, the Republic manages to neutralize the virus as well as opening up and establishing relations with the Colonies by building transborder cities; June continues to serve in the Republic's military, rekindles her friendship with Tess, and briefly dates Anden; while Day, now known by his given name, Daniel, leaves the Republic to accompany Eden to attend military academy in Antarctica after the latter has regained his eyesight. Ten years after the invasion, June is about to have dinner with Tess when she hears Day and Eden are coming back. As she dashes her hope to meet Day, June stumbles on him and Eden, realizing that Tess has made them reunite. Day stops June, thinking he recognizes her. He begins to recover some memories, though they are scattered. He wants to know her further and introduces himself, an action foreshadowed in Prodigy. Characters June Iparis- A sixteen-year-old prodigy, who scored a 1500 (the maximum score) on her Trial. She decides at the end of the book to not tell Day whom she is, as she thinks that his suffering and pain is caused by her. When he appears dying, she pleas for his survival. She then lets go of Day, telling herself that it is for the best. She is good at appealing to other's emotions and understanding people's backgrounds, as well as observing things around her. In the epilogue, Day and June meet again, when they are both twenty-seven, and re-introduce themselves in hopes of becoming friends again. Daniel (Day) Altan Wing- A sixteen-year-old boy, who, by time he is ten, done for with the Republic. During the ending sequence, he is shot twice. He ends up in a coma for five months, as he also needs surgery on his hippocampus. He is also a prodigy but is mostly considered the \\"Legend \\" and \\"Champion\\" of the Republic, who also scores a 1500 as well, but he didn't know this. Throughout the book, he experiences several excruciatingly painful headaches, which comes from the experiments on him that happed when he ‚Äòfailed‚Äô his trial. Eden Bataar Wing- Day's younger brother, who Day will do anything to protect. Day is adamant of not letting the Republic experiment on Eden again, but Eden agrees to do it. Eden was very sick from the plague. Captain Thomas Alexander Bryant- A very loyal soldier to the Republic; however he is too loyal and follows his commander's orders exactly, which results in placing him as a traitor in an assassination plot against the Elector. He is killed by Colonie's soldiers. Anden Stavropoulos- The young leader/elector of the Republic who is attracted to June Tess- An orphan girl whom Day took in, and is becoming attracted to Day. She joins the Patriot organization as a Medic-in-training. Commander Natasha Jameson- Important antagonist in the series who is a murderer and attempted to kill Anden and June Pascao- A member of the Patriots, and leader of the Runners.

It was also released as the B-side to his #1 single \\"You've Got a Friend\\". It has often been described as a lullaby. It was initially recorded by his sister Kate Taylor for her 1971 album Sister Kate. The song has been covered by many artists, including Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt, Maureen McGovern, Richie Havens, Sheryl Crow, Sting, Eddie Vedder with Natalie Maines, and the King's Singers. James Taylor's version Taylor wrote \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" about a year before it was recorded in early 1971. Taylor regards it as \\"a secular hymn.\\" Author Dave Thompson considers it one of the best songs Taylor had written up to that point. Allmusic critic Bill Janovitz describes \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" as \\"a beautiful lullaby\\", and Rolling Stone critic Ben Gerson similarly calls it \\"an exquisite lullaby.\\" Critic Al Rudis goes further, saying that the song \\"continues [Taylor's] hold on the world championship of lullaby composers.\\" Allmusic's William Ruhlmann describes it as a \\"moving\\" song that affirms romance. Martin Charles Strong describes it as being \\"lovely\\" and \\"more affecting\\" than \\"You've Got a Friend.\\" Musicologist James Perone finds similarities between the melody of the verses of \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" and the chorus of Taylor's earlier song \\"Carolina in My Mind.\\" Gerson compares the song's melody to that of Cat Stevens' \\"Here Comes My Baby.\\" Janovitz points out a duality in the lyrics. The lyrics attempt to comfort the singer's lover, possibly after a fight. But the lyrics also sound a possibly ominous note, in that he sings \\"But I can sing this song/And you can sing this song when I'm gone,\\" suggesting that he may be leaving her soon, although it is not specified whether \\"I'm gone\\" refers to ending the relationship or just going away for a while. Perone that the theme of a singer who can't express his feelings except through song gives \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" an \\"autobiographical-sounding feeling of authenticity.\\" Perone feels that the \\"unconventional overall structure and somewhat unpredictable phrase structure\\" produce a feeling of \\"from-the-heart spontaneity.\\" Gerson notes that the themes in the song of farewell and that this could be the singer's last song are themes that run throughout the Mud Slide Slim album, calling \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" \\"the song which repudiates songs.\\" Authors including Thompson and Sheila Weller have suggested that the song was written to Taylor's one- time girlfriend Joni Mitchell. Taylor has confirmed this theory, stating during at least one stage performance that it was written for Mitchell. The song was written while Taylor and Mitchell were staying in a hotel in Tucumcari, NM as Taylor was filming \\"Two-Lane Blacktop.\\" The only instrumentation is Taylor's acoustic guitar, although live performances confirm that the closing riff actually blends two guitars to create the baroque effect. Janovitz praises Taylor's \\"exquisite\\" guitar playing, particularly noting the \\"Renaissance-meets-country-folk riff\\" at the beginning and end of the song. He also praises Taylor's \\"vulnerable\\" \\"quiet\\" singing. Taylor has performed \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" in live concerts many times, including accompanied by other singers. He performed it with Mitchell during the early 1970s. One such performance, from October 16, 1970, is included on the 2009 album Amchitka. A performance with Carole King is included on the 2010 album Live at the Troubadour. A solo live performance leads off the 1998 video Live at the Beacon Theater and a different solo live performance closes the 2007 live album One Man Band. A live performance is included on The Essential James Taylor. A live version was also included on the Japanese release of the compilation album Greatest Hits Volume 2. The studio version was included on the compilation album The Best of James Taylor. On September 11, 2011, Taylor performed the song in New York City at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The song also was a regular set closer from 2004-07, 2009-12 & 2017-19 Cover versions Linda Ronstadt covered \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" as the closing track of her 1974 album Heart Like a Wheel. According to music journalist Dave Thompson, producer Peter Asher, who produced both Taylor's Mud Slide Slim and Ronstadt's Heart Like a Wheel, reinvented the song for Ronstadt. Thompson considers it a \\"highlight\\" of Heart Like a Wheel. James Taylor's ex-wife Carly Simon covered the song on her 2007 album Into White accompanied by her children with Taylor, Sally Taylor and Ben Taylor. Author Sheila Weller describes this version as \\"slow, spectral\\" and \\"achingly beautiful.\\" According to Allmusic critic Thom Jurek, mother and children \\"perform gorgeously\\" on this version. Taylor's sister Kate Taylor recorded the song for her 1971 album Sister Kate. Allmusic critic Joe Viglione called it one of the \\"real knockout tunes\\" on Sister Kate.

[Ààauk…ô], is a quite common West Frisian masculine given name. It seems to have been a diminutive form originally (-ke is one of the most common diminutive suffices in West Frisian), which developed from the historic form Auwe or Auwen. According to onomatologist Rienk de Haan, Auwe was a very reduced form of certain Germanic names, possibly starting with Alf- (meaning \\"elf\\", \\"supernatural\\" or \\"nature spirit\\").Rienk de Haan, Fryske Foarnammen, Leeuwarden, 2002 (Friese Pers Boekerij), , p. 35. In West Frisian, masculine given names can usually be adapted to equivalent feminine given names. In the case of Auke, this is accomplished by dropping the voiceless final syllable and adding a diminutive suffix in its place (in this case -je), resulting in Aukje. This is a very common feminine given name in Friesland.Rienk de Haan, Fryske Foarnammen, Leeuwarden, 2002 (Friese Pers Boekerij), , p. 35.

Programmes are also carried by a number of overseas radio stations including in the US and New Zealand. Distinctive ministerial emphases =The necessity of regular Gospel preaching= He has repeatedly lobbied for the necessity of distinctive and frequent evangelistic addresses, and lamented the loss of this basic duty amongst evangelical ministers. His own church has a specific evangelistic service at 6.30pm on Sundays. =Separatism= By calling other ministers to remember and consider the Downgrade Controversy, Peter Masters has advocated a duty of ministerial separation from churches which have defected from basic precepts of historical evangelical doctrine, like the necessity of regeneration, justification by faith without works, or the infallibility and sufficiency of the Bible for church rule. In this he has repeated the call of Martyn Lloyd-Jones, in his controversy with John Stott, to separate from non- evangelical churches, and followed in the tradition of E. J. Poole-Connor, the original founder of the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches. =Charismatic movement= He has opposed and challenged the teaching of the Charismatic Movement that New Testament sign gifts are still extant, arguing that the Bible contains the promise that it is both sufficient and complete, rendering new revelation both redundant and dangerous. This position has been described as cessationist. He has, upon the same grounds, critiqued claims of the gift of miraculous healing as spurious, lacking credibility and sometimes occultic. =Young Earth Creationist= He opposes Neo-Darwinian evolution, which some evangelicals have seen historically as a form of humanist propaganda, and as a doctrine viewed as wholly at variance with the first books of the Bible. He helped found the Newton Scientific Association, and has supported lectures and talks examining weaknesses of the theory.

They installed a coffee shop (Pedal a Latte‚Äô) to serve their staff and customers. They worked with bicycle traveler Willie Weir to design and market a bicycle that R + E Cycles had built for him in 1996, the Willie Weir Adventure (UTB) bicycle. In 2005 they acquired Bushnell Cycle design, hired Master Frame Builder Dennis Bushnell, and patented their bottom bracket design.

Many interested ownership groups are associated with existing men's soccer teams, often from Major League Soccer. Six current NWSL ownership groups also run men's teams: original franchise Portland Thorns FC (Portland Timbers), relocated original franchise North Carolina Courage (North Carolina FC), the first three outright expansion teams, namely the Houston Dash (Houston Dynamo), Orlando Pride (Orlando City SC), and Utah Royals FC (Real Salt Lake), and OL Reign (French Ligue 1 club Olympique Lyonnais); before being sold to , Reign FC's ownership group included the principal owner of Seattle Sounders FC. A confirmed future team in Louisville will also share ownership with a men's team (Louisville City FC). Another original franchise, FC Kansas City, was initially owned by the same group running the Missouri Comets, but was sold to new ownership in January 2017 before folding in November of that year.  Formation and original eight teams  When the NWSL was first announced on November 21, 2012, by US Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati, the number and location of the original teams was the only finalized detail (the name and logo of the league was not yet confirmed, for example). Gulati announced that the league would have teams in Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Western New York, New Jersey, Portland, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Four of the teams - the Western New York Flash, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars and Sky Blue FC (in New Jersey) - moved to the new first-division NWSL from the now-defunct Women's Professional Soccer, while the other four teams were new franchises, though technically the Washington Spirit were a rebrand of the D.C. United Women. Two of the new teams had an established tie to a men's professional soccer team; Portland Thorns FC was affiliated with and owned by the same ownership group as Portland's MLS team, the Portland Timbers and FC Kansas City was affiliated with and owned by the same group running the Missouri Comets indoor soccer team. = Original expansion prospects = The eight teams chosen for the first season came from a pool of twelve interested ownership groups. Soon after launch, the league reportedly planned to expand to ten teams for 2014. Potential candidates included groups not accepted as part of the original eight; groups from the Los Angeles area and from Hartford, Connecticut were confirmed failed bids, as was one from the Seattle Sounders Women. After the 2014 NWSL season, none of these four ownership groups were still in the expansion picture. There was speculation that the Vancouver Whitecaps Women could be logical candidates especially given the WWC 2015 in Canada; however, the Whitecaps cancelled their women's program (except for one U-18 academy team) in December 2012.  Connecticut  An ownership group, previously attempting to join Women's Professional Soccer for the 2012 season, had existed in Hartford, Connecticut for a year at the time of the announcement, and had been attempting to join the initial list of teams for the NWSL. The team was intended to be named the 'Connecticut Courage', a name still under consideration. Former General Manager of the WPS side Philadelphia Independence, Terry Foley, had accepted a position with the expected Connecticut team, whose owners have not been announced publicly.  Los Angeles  The original Los Angeles bid for an NWSL was a joint effort from the LA Strikers and Pali Blues, two of the strongest W-League teams - the LA Strikers had a working agreement with MLS side Chivas USA, and the Pali Blues were one of the winningest W-League team ever with (then) two titles and four playoff appearances in five seasons, having already included many future WPS, USWNT, and NWSL talent. While being a merger of two strong, already-semi- pro teams in the second-largest US market, the bid was declined reportedly for geographical concerns. Pali Blues won the 2013 W-League championship, then officially merged with LA Strikers and won the 2014 title as well. However, after the 2014 season, the LA Strikers' MLS partner Chivas USA folded, and the Pali Blues ownership folded the W-League team shortly after to focus on the USL Pro side instead.  FC Indiana  FC Indiana is one of the strongest WPSL sides, and had competed in WPSL Elite along with eventual NWSL sides Boston, Chicago, and Western New York. While there was no official confirmation, the team's website suggested that they were one of the twelve original NWSL bids. Team owner (and Haitian WNT coach) Shek Borkowski later suggested that the CFU could subsidize an NWSL team similar to the subsidization already supplied by the USSF, CSA, and FMF. FC Indiana moved from WPSL to United Women's Soccer in 2016, for that league's sophomore season.  Early Expansion: 2013‚Äì2016  = Houston Dash (2014) = During the inaugural season, there was confirmed interest from the WPSL side Houston Aces. However, the league announced during the 2013 NWSL playoffs in August that there would be no expansion for the league's second season. During the 2013-2014 offseason, the Houston Dynamo added their name to the list of MLS teams interested in fielding a women's side, stating that they were \\"exploring the opportunity\\" of starting an NWSL side in 2014 or 2015, and in December 2013 they announced that the Houston Dash would join the NWSL in 2014. By early December, the NWSL approved the Dynamo-run Dash for expansion in 2014 despite their earlier statement that there would be no expansion for the league's second season. = Orlando Pride (2016) = After the media boom of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, MLS side Orlando City SC entered the expansion picture. A fan blog reported the owners openly discussing their inability to comment on the issue, essentially giving an answer \\"without an answer being given\\", which OCSC followed the next day with a press release supporting women's soccer and their Elite Clubs National League (ECNL) side while stopping short of stating positively or negatively about potential NWSL expansion. On October 20, 2015, the NWSL announced that Orlando would host the 10th NWSL team, the Orlando Pride, due to start the 2016 season. At that announcement, the Pride announced that they had hired former U.S. National Women's Team coach Tom Sermanni. Days later, the Pride traded with the Portland Thorns for U.S. national team forward Alex Morgan -- Orlando City SC had previously acquired Morgan's husband, Servando Carrasco -- and Canadian national team midfielder Kaylyn Kyle, in exchange for rights to U.S. national team defender Meghan Klingenberg (via the Houston Dash and Seattle Reign FC), the first overall pick in the 2016 NWSL College Draft, an international roster spot for the 2016 and 2017 seasons, and the rights to U.S. national team midfielder Lindsey Horan. This was the most notable trade in NWSL history at the time it was made, and it was speculated widely that the acquisition of Morgan was a condition for joining the league, or at least for doing so in 2016 rather than in a future season.  Growing Pains: 2016‚Äì2018  = Western New York Flash to Cary, North Carolina (2017) = North Carolina FC, then playing in the NASL and now in the USL Championship (USLC), also expressed interest in establishing a NWSL side, with club owner Steve Malik mentioning talks between the league and the then Carolina Railhawks in May 2016. In December of that same year, the Railhawks organization prematurely released press announcements of their rebranding as well as intentions to establish expansion franchises in MLS and the NWSL. A few days later on December 6, the club officially announced its pursuit of an NWSL team, with a goal of establishing one within the next six months. Instead of creating an expansion franchise in the NWSL, North Carolina FC acquired the rights to the 2016 NWSL championship-winning Western New York Flash. While the Flash's 2016 attendance was their second-best in their NWSL history and was fifth out of the ten 2016 NWSL teams, the Flash had much lower attendances their previous two seasons and were not close to filling Rochester Rhinos Stadium. Then-owner Joe Sahlen's familial connections to the team had eroded quickly over the previous year, and the Flash also had a public debacle in 2016 when they hosted the Seattle Reign FC in a baseball stadium on a pitch much narrower than FIFA guidelines, drawing negative national media attention to the league. The league subsequently fined the Flash, with Joe Sahlen and team president Alex Sahlen apologizing for the incident's damage to the league's reputation. The Flash and North Carolina FC announced the sale and relocation on January 9, 2017, fewer than three months after the Flash won the 2016 NWSL championship, with the relocated team to be renamed the North Carolina Courage. In their official statement, the Sahlen family claimed that \\"the Western New York market is not the right fit for the NWSL and the future direction of the league\\". Malik had previously purchased the trademark for the original Carolina Courage franchise from the defunct Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), and the lioness on the WUSA team's crest is featured on the NWSL team's crest. = FC Kansas City effectively to Salt Lake City, Utah (2017) = At a press conference in September 2014, Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hansen mentioned RSL expanding the club to include professional minor league and women's teams, in addition to the pro major league and amateur women's teams they already had. RSL's interest in the NWSL was officially confirmed in November, with the NWSL team intended to share a new stadium (and likely a name) with the USL Pro side Real Monarchs SLC. While the stadium deal initially looked promising, it fell through at the original location of the Utah State Fairpark in early February 2015. The team chose a new stadium location in West Valley City by early March, with meetings between RSL and the NWSL moving forward. In 2016, the Real Salt Lake Women joined United Women's Soccer in 2016 for its inaugural season. While the organization still expressed interest in a future move up to NWSL, such a move no longer appeared to be imminent; in contrast, the USL Monarchs started play in 2015 with the team's training facility (which includes a 5,000-seat stadium) opening in August 2017, still with no overt interest from RSL or NWSL in pursuing a Utah franchise at the time. Meanwhile, the original owners of NWSL two-time champions FC Kansas City got mired in an e-mail scandal during the 2016-2017 offseason, ultimately causing the ownership group to split up and the team to be sold to Minnesota-based businessman Elam Baer. However, Baer and his management team were largely absent, causing FCKC's attendance figures to dissolve, and at times the team did not meet league minimum requirements for roster payroll or away-game traveling contingents. This led to extensive behind-the-scenes discussions of selling FCKC once again, which led to five- year head coach Vlatko Andonovski finally leaving the club in October. After previous talks with another Minnesota-based group and with Sporting KC both fell through, Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hansen rapidly changed positions from not wanting to \\"promote\\" the RSL Women from UWS to agreeing to purchase franchise rights for a new NWSL team over the course of just 15 days, heavily influenced by discussions with Timbers/Thorns owner Merrit Paulson. At the time of the announcement, there were no indications it was a direct relocation of FC Kansas City; later that week, it was officially announced that Baer had sold FCKC back to NWSL to fold the team, at which point franchise rights went to Hansen, with the league ultimately transferring all player contracts to Salt Lake City as well. Thus, while the team shuffle may appear to be a relocation, there was no direct sale of the team from Baer to Hansen. The new Salt Lake NWSL team, which did not replace the existing RSL Women, ultimately played in Rio Tinto Stadium. On December 1, the new name for the Salt Lake NWSL team was announced as Utah Royals FC. = Boston Breakers disbanded (2018) = Prior to the sudden disbanding of FC Kansas City, it was the Boston Breakers that were in discussion for Real Salt Lake to take over. The team never had a truly viable long-term home stadium and only averaged over 3,000 fans for a full season once in their recent history. The collapse of the FCKC situation was thankfully coincident with the appearance of potential investors for Boston, though the investors were uncertain to be ready in time for the 2018 season. On Jan 28, the NWSL announced the Boston Breakers would fold, and players distributed to the other franchises through a dispersal draft on Jan 30th.  Growth Phase: 2019‚Äìpresent  = Racing Louisville FC (2021) = In March 2019, discussion about Lynn Family Stadium in Louisville, Kentucky, set to open in 2020 as the new home of USLC side Louisville City FC, included discussion of a potential NWSL team, eyeing 2021 or 2022 ‚Äî notable due to the existing connection between then NWSL president Amanda Duffy and the USLC side, as she had held three top-level positions within the club during her tenure there. By August, reports began coming out that Louisville was very close to being approved as the 10th team for the 2020 NWSL season. However, this was later pushed back to 2021 because of Louisville City's concerns about its transition to the new stadium, with the 2020 expansion planned to go to Sacramento instead. The Louisville franchise was officially announced on October 22, 2019 and unveiled as Proof Louisville FC on November 12 of that year. This marked the first time an NWSL franchise was announced more than five months in advance of its first game. However, fan backlash to the name - and to the associated rebrand of parent club Lou City FC - cause the ownership group to balk, later deciding on new name Racing Louisville FC and an entirely new crest. = Los Angeles (2022) = After MLS side Chivas USA folded, the league awarded a new team to the Los Angeles area in 2014, whose ownership group included USWNT legend Mia Hamm, her husband Nomar Garciaparra, and Lakers legend and Sparks co-owner Magic Johnson. This caused some criticism of Hamm for investing in men's soccer before women's soccer, but mostly fueled speculation that the new MLS side would likely invest in an NWSL team as well, which Hamm commented \\"just makes sense\\". When asked about the status of an LAFC NWSL team following the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, Hamm stated that the LAFC ownership group was focused on getting several years of experience with MLS revenues and expenses before committing to an NWSL team. In the summer of 2020, news broke of a new NWSL Los Angeles expansion talks with some potential MLS involvement. LAFC denied being the MLS side involved with this group, suggesting instead that the Los Angeles Galaxy (who already field a team in WPSL) as the potential operating partner. However, on July 21, 2020, the NWSL confirmed that it had awarded expansion rights to an group of investors to bring a team to Los Angeles, not including the Galaxy but including Hamm and her husband, targeting entry for the 2022 season. No formal team name was announced, though the investment group coined itself \\"Angel City\\" and has premptively registered a trademark for \\"Angel City FC\\". The investment group consisted of a variety of celebrities, including Natalie Portman, Jennifer Garner, and Eva Longoria, as well as Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and his wife, tennis player Serena Williams, author Glennon Doyle, and Casey Neistat. Several former members of the United States women's national soccer team, including Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, and Abby Wambach, were also involved in the effort.  Future expansion prospects  In early 2015, six groups had expressed interest in gaining entry into NWSL, four of which were known - Real Salt Lake, the Indy Eleven, the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, and an independent group from Atlanta. The other two groups were rumored to be western MLS clubs. NWSL commissioner Jeff Plush stated that any potential expansion for 2016 would have to be announced soon after the April owners' meeting; the Atlanta group was the only publicly announced group interested in 2016 expansion, and when no announcement came from NWSL by May, it seemed 2016 expansion was dead. However, the success of the United States women's national soccer team in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup renewed expansion talks, with the number of interested groups ballooning to twelve - more than the current size of the league. The first result of this post-WWC boom was Orlando's expansion into the league for the 2016 season. Several months after the NWSL announced the Orlando Pride's addition to the league, commissioner Jeff Plush also announced that the NWSL planned to expand by an additional four teams, to a total of 14 teams by 2020. At the time, Plush suggested that the league was in varying stages of talks with a dozen different potential expansion groups, many of whom were from MLS organizations. MLS commissioner Don Garber stated in April 2016 that half of MLS teams could be running NWSL teams in the near future. In August 2019, Merritt Paulson, principal owner of Portland Thorns FC in the NWSL and the Portland Timbers in MLS and also a major player in the NWSL's expansion committee, held an open forum with supporters in which he stated there were two new teams committed to the NWSL for 2020, and a third aiming for a 2021 launch. He added that the teams in line for 2020 were in the Southeast and West Coast, and that the potential 2021 entry would be a ‚Äúreally significant, big-name addition‚Äù to the NWSL. Paulson then went further, saying \\"One of them‚Äôs an MLS team, one of them will be an MLS team, one of them‚Äôs a USL team. That‚Äôs probably more than I should have said.\\" An unnamed source told the women's soccer news outlet The Equalizer that the three markets Paulson was alluding to were, in order of mention, Atlanta (MLS side Atlanta United FC), Sacramento (USL Championship side Sacramento Republic FC, whose ownership group ultimately received a future MLS team in October 2019), and Louisville (USL Championship side Louisville City FC). Louisville was the first of these markets to be officially announced as a new NWSL entry. In late 2019, the league announced plans to expand from nine teams to fourteen over the next three years. However, a combination of disagreements between NWSL and USSF on how the league should be run (especially concerning a commissioner) and the later COVID-19 pandemic, this schedule was pushed back with no expansion in 2020. However, multiple league officials still have voiced optimisim about reaching fourteen teams in the near future. = Current interest =  Austin, Texas  Austin, Texas has been listed as a potential NWSL expansion candidate multiple times since summer of 2018, though very few details are known concerning the potential ownership group aside from a rare mention of Anthony Precourt of MLS's Austin FC.  Sacramento  USL side Sacramento Republic FC has also commented on Twitter several times in 2015 and 2016 that adding an NWSL side is part of their long-term plan. Kevin Nagle, a part of the Republic's ownership group, further confirmed their interest in a women's team in November 2016 after the NWSL's commissioner at the time, Jeff Plush, identified California as a priority market for the league.. In 2019, it was reported Sacramento was in advanced discussions to join the NWSL in 2020, with ownership group being led by Sacramento Republic owner Kevin Nagle with involvement from the California Storm WPSL team, who recently added USWNT legends Brandi Chastain and Leslie Osborne and Brazilian WNTer Sissi to their board of directors. However, the deal fell through, partially due to uncertainty surrounding the league in its late-year conflict with USSF concerning league operations, as well as unspecified issues with the Sacramento group. Despite those issues, Sacramento remains on the table as of July 2020. = Status unknown or unlikely =  Atlanta  An investment group out of Atlanta went public in early January 2015 with its intent to bring an NWSL team to the city that has already seen two incarnations of professional women's soccer in WUSA and WPS - with a website already live and a stadium already decided. While there was initial fan interest, many objected to the initially proposed name of the Atlanta Vibe, prompting the investment group to open a poll for the name, as was a survey for team colors. The group eventually chose red and black for the team's identity, while the stadium was changed from Henderson Field at Grady Stadium to Silverbacks Park, but there had been no sign of any talk between the group and NWSL at that point, despite the fact that the group has been working toward NWSL expansion for over 18 months. After the early-summer NWSL owners' meeting, it appeared that Atlanta was rejected for 2016 and would have to continue trying for future expansion. In December 2016, rumors surfaced of another group reportedly trying to bring both NASL and NWSL teams to Atlanta. The proposed team would play at a to-be- constructed facility in DeKalb County. The group revealed itself in February 2017 as First Team SC and announced their proposal to play in the just- announced Atlanta Sports City complex in DeKalb County. This included a scheduled announcement for April 2017, but First Team SC delayed that announcement indefinitely, citing \\"the landscape of American soccer changing dramatically.\\" Fans reported receiving surveys via e-mail concerning the ongoing efforts in December 2017 with the aim of a 2019 launch.  FC Barcelona  In July 2016, FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu stated in an interview on Bar√ßa TV that he wanted to \\"create a team that can take part in the National Women's Soccer League\\". The Spanish club was reportedly interested in establishing a NWSL side in New York, Los Angeles, or the San Francisco Bay area. Barcelona's board approved plans to pursue an NWSL expansion team in May 2017, with a goal of launching the team as early as 2018 but no further details released to the public. The expansion effort was ultimately pushed back to a 2019 launch date, with Bar√ßa zeroing in on Santa Monica, California as a potential location. Soon after, it was reported that FCB and LAFC were in talks to work together at bringing NWSL to Los Angeles. After years of talks, though, the prospect of a joint expansion effort fell through, with sources from NWSL stating that FCB's desire to keep their branding was a major reason for any expansion effort including FCB to be unlikely. Concerns about requests for changing NWSL's internaonal player rules were also said to be a sticking point.  Canada  On April 16, 2013, just after the NWSL's inaugural season began, The Equalizer interviewed NWSL Commissioner Cheryl Bailey about numerous topics, including expansion. She responded to a question focused on Toronto and Vancouver by noting that there was considerable interest in longer-term expansion, but also interest in getting in early, ostensibly for the 2014 season, and said that the NWSL would start looking at expansion potential in Canada toward the later portion of the 2013 season. In July 2014, Peter Montopoli, general secretary of the Canadian Soccer Association, suggested that the upcoming 2015 Women's World Cup offered an opportunity for the NWSL to expand to Canadian cities, with speculation that the expansion could even occur in time for the 2015 NWSL season. However, in late August 2014, Bailey said there would be no expansion for 2015, citing the logistical challenges of scheduling the league around the Women's World Cup that might put off expansion until at least 2016. With high fan interest in Canada during and following the World Cup, the Whitecaps reiterated that there was \\"nothing imminent\\" in terms of the Whitecaps organization joining NWSL, making it highly unlikely that they were one of the then-dozen groups in discussion with the league concerning expansion. At an end-of-season meeting with three Whitecaps supporters groups in 2016, the Whitecaps inquired about the prospect of a Vancouver NWSL team. Meanwhile, officials and spokespersons for Toronto FC and the Montreal Impact reiterated that their clubs had no intention of joining the NWSL.  Cincinnati  MLS expansion club FC Cincinnati has expressed interest in gaining a NWSL club once their new West End Stadium opens in 2021. USWNT and NWSL star Rose Lavelle, a Cincinnati native, has spoken several times about her desire to play professional soccer in Cincinnati.  Dallas  FC Dallas reinstated its WPSL team FC Dallas Women for the 2016 WPSL season, after having only fielded an ECNL side following a previous two-year stint in WPSL. While the team's coach Ben Waldrum suggested that an NWSL franchise should be a goal, he noted in June 2016 that there had been no directive from Hunt Sports Group to pursue one.  Indianapolis  Indy Eleven, which moved from the NASL to the USL after the 2017 season and was previously led by ex-Chicago-Red-Stars GM Peter Wilt, expressed interest in an NWSL side in 2015, contingent on them getting a new soccer-specific stadium built for the Eleven with a target date in 2017. The Eleven's inability to secure the stadium plan delayed Indianapolis NWSL expansion until 2018 at the earliest. In 2019, the Indiana General Assembly passed a stadium bill for the Eleven, for the newly proposed Eleven Park. The developers have expressed interest in a potential Women's soccer team to play at the stadium. Miami Inter Miami CF owner David Beckham has voiced interest in adding an NWSL side to his MLS club but no plans have been openly discussed.  Minnesota  Before NWSL bought FC Kansas City back from Minnesota-based Elam Baer, a second Minnesota-based group was in discussion for purchasing the team, though discussion about relocation was unsure. After the sale and disbanding of the team, Baer stated that he was interested in eventually rejoining NWSL ownership to bring a team directly to Minnesota as he believed the league to be \\"a good long-term investment\\".  New York City  City Football Group has expressed interest in starting a team in NWSL to mirror their MLS side New York City FC after having created very successful sister teams to Manchester City and Melbourne City. Current NWSL side Sky Blue FC had previously been in talk with both NYCFC and the New York Red Bulls for a partnership, but the nothing came of the 2014 talks with NYCFC and Sky Blue rejected the 2013 proposed deal from NYRB.  Pittsburgh  Under new ownership in 2014 after having recently gone through bankruptcy, USL Pro side Pittsburgh Riverhounds also expressed interest in NWSL as an expansion on top of the youth structure already in place. As of 2015, the Riverhounds planned to expand their stadium capacity by 50%, and their target for an NWSL team was 2018.  San Jose  Conflicting reports in 2014 and 2015 linked MLS's San Jose Earthquakes to a potential NWSL team. However, Earthquakes president Dave Kaval stated in May 2016 that the Earthquakes were interested in bringing an NWSL side to San Jose but were waiting for the approval and completion of a training and academy complex in order to be capable of hosting a NWSL or USL side. Kaval reiterated his previous comments on the NWSL in November, and added with regard to the training facility that \\"We‚Äôre in Week 20 in a 60-week process. Next summer they could certify the EIR (environmental impact report).\\"  Other USL markets  In August 2018, Research Triangle TV station WRAL reported on remarks made by North Carolina Courage owner Steve Malik, also owner of the USL's North Carolina FC, to WRAL's sister radio station. He had been asked about rumors that the NWSL and USL were exploring a partnership, and chose to reframe the question to the issue of league expansion: > I just came from the USL meetings. Are there USL clubs that NWSL is talking > to? Absolutely. There are some great fits where, if you build a 10,000- to > 12,000-seat stadium in an urban area in a top 40 or top 50 market, > particularly one that may not have Major League Soccer. If you own that > stadium, do you want some dates? Yeah, you want some dates. The WRAL-TV report speculated that at least five USL markets were potentially viable as NWSL expansion targets for 2020 and beyond. In addition to Louisville, now set for a 2021 NWSL debut, Hartford, Phoenix, Sacramento, and San Antonio were identified as possible targets. Amanda Duffy, then NWSL director of operations, has connections to the management of San Antonio FC, having previously worked under that club's managing director Tim Holt when he was the president of the USL parent organization. However, after the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, USL announced its intention to form its own women's league, suggesting that previous talks with NWSL fell through and that future NWSL expansion for USL ownership groups is highly unlikely.

She studied Drama at the Max Reinhardt Seminar (Reinhardt Seminar) now part of the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. In 1942 she began her professional career with an engagement at the Salzburg State Theatre. Her film career was an immediate success. She had a debut minor role in Herbert Maisch's Music in Salzburg followed in 1943 by her first major role as Bettina Altoff in Arthur Rabenhalt's escapist circus film Zirkus Renz.

Other lauded roles included: that of Roszi in the German crime thrillers Dark Eyes where she shared top billing with Cornell Borchers and Will Quadflieg.In Italy, she appeared in the 1953 Italian language comedy Martin Toccaferro directed by Leonardo De Mitri. As the 1950s progressed she played less lead roles but remained in constant demand in supporting roles such as T√§nzerin Anni W√ºhrer in the 1953 remake of The Emperor Waltz set in the fading days of the Austrian Empire. Other supporting roles include: St Croix in Eugen York's Das Fr√§ulein von Scuderi (1955) and in Karl Hartl's The Life and Loves of Mozart where she played Suzi Geri. In the following decades, Hauff's stage work became a priority. In 1955 until her death in 1983 she was a member of the prestigious Vienna Burgtheatre an institution of cultural importance to German speakers similar to the role the Shakespeare Company has in English speaking theatre. The Burgtheatre had an established tradition as a visiting company and Hauff toured through Germany and Austria, playing roles at the Schiller Theatre in Berlin and the Munich Kammerspiele. Shortly before her death she was awarded the honorary title Kammertressin in recognition of preeminence at the Burgtheatre. Jan Onderwater (IMDb) In the late 1970s she returned to the screen as the mother of Olivia Pascal in the French comedy Arr√™te ton char... bidasse! directed by Michel G√©rard. In one of her last film roles she memorably played the outraged mother of Austrian artist Egon Schiele in Herbert Vesely's international co-production Egon Schiele ‚Äì Exzess und Bestrafung.

The results are presented in clusters of prioritized relevance to business and government analysts. Piranha uses the term frequency/inverse corpus frequency term weighting method which provides strong parallel processing of textual information, thus the ability to analyze very large document sets. Piranha has six main strengths: Collecting and Extracting: Millions of documents from numerous sources such as databases and social media can be collected and text extracted from hundreds of file formats; This info. can then be translated to any number of languages. Storing and indexing: Documents in search servers, relational databases, etc. can be stored and indexed at will. Recommending: Recommending the most valuable information for particular users. Categorizing: Grouping items via supervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods and targeted search lists. Clustering: Similarity is used to create a hierarchical group of documents. Visualizing: Showing relationships among documents so that users can quickly recognize connections.

It was released with another single, \\"Birth in Reverse\\", on a gold vinyl triangle packaged with the album. The song, whose lyrics deal with dependence on social media, and its music video have both received positive attention from critics. Darkside produced a remix soon after the song's release. Release \\"Digital Witness\\" was released as an advance single from St. Vincent on 6 January 2014. The music video premiered on 31 January 2014. Prior to its release, the single was available to pre-order on a die-cut vinyl triangle with \\"Birth in Reverse\\" as its B-side. The record was a limited edition of 1,000 copies, packaged with CD and LP copies of St. Vincent. Composition Annie Clark has said that the song \\"encapsulates this idea where we've become very dependent on other people [...] a million digital eyes, validating our experience\\". The lyrics are a clear commentary on social media, including Clark's own experience on websites such as Twitter, which self-deprecatingly she describes as \\"pathetic\\". In an existential sense, the lyrics question how people evaluate what is and is not important in the digital age. Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph compared \\"Digital Witness\\" to \\"I Should Watch TV\\", a track from Love This Giant, Clark's 2013 collaboration with David Byrne; she concluded that Clark likely took a cue from Byrne in composing \\"Digital Witness\\". St. Asaph noted similarities between the funky rhythms and brass instruments in both tracks, as well as their shared lyrical themes. She calls \\"Digital Witness\\" \\"celebratory as it's cautionary\\", like \\"I Should Watch TV\\", which she describes as \\"half-embracing\\" and \\"half-disdaining\\" popular television culture. Reviewer Heather Phares expressed a similar sentiment, calling \\"Digital Witness\\" a song with \\"close kinship\\" to Love This Giant. Critical reception \\"Digital Witness\\" received positive attention from music critics. Cady Drell, in a review for Rolling Stone, gave the song 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"the sound of an art-pop weirdo throwing a curveball by playing it delightfully straight\\". Heather Phares, in an Allmusic review of St. Vincent, cited \\"Digital Witness\\" as an example of Clark's \\"razor-sharp wit\\". The track is designated as an Allmusic \\"pick\\". It placed 14th on The Village Voices 2014 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Music video The music video for \\"Digital Witness\\" was directed by Chino Moya and was recorded in Madrid. The video is surreal in nature, featuring Annie Clark moving robotically, surrounded by pastel colors and geometric architecture. The style is reminiscent of the 1927 German epic film Metropolis. Upon its release, the video was praised for its visual appeal and subtle critique of contemporary music videos. Writing for SPIN, Marc Hogan described the video as depicting \\"dystopian conformity\\" in conjunction with the song's lyrical commentary on social media. The music video was rated as the tenth-best video of 2014 by Rolling Stone. Remix Darkside produced a remix of \\"Digital Witness\\", which was released on March 30, 2014. The remix pitch shifts Clark's vocal into a lower range. Although Darkside preserved the song's prominent saxophone, it was mixed down in favor of a bass synthesizer that they introduced. The remix was released as a 12\\" vinyl single, with the a cappella track from \\"Digital Witness\\" as its B-side. The track is also included with the deluxe edition of St. Vincent, which was released in February 2015.

He was named to that position prior to the 2003 season and left after the 2014 season to join Hittinguru 3D. He previously served in the same position from 1997 through 2000. In the intervening years, his father, Hall-of-Famer Gary Ward, worked as head coach of the Aggies while Rocky assisted. Playing career Ward first enrolled at Connors State, which compiled at 72‚Äì13 record in 1985. He then played one season at Western Oklahoma State before completing his eligibility at Oklahoma State while playing for his father. In his two seasons in Stillwater, the Cowboys reached the 1987 College World Series final and amassed a 61‚Äì8 record in 1988 and were atop the Baseball America poll for 12 weeks. Coaching career After graduating from Oklahoma State, Ward established the Mid-America Baseball School, and served as marketing director and an instructor with the program which helped develop the skills of young players until 1994. In that year, he became an assistant coach at Indianapolis. After one season with the Greyhounds, he moved to Kansas State, where he spent two years as recruiting coordinator and worked with infielders and hitters. He earned the head coaching position at New Mexico State beginning in 1997 and served four seasons before giving way to his father. After two seasons as an assistant, Rocky again assumed the top spot with the Aggies. Since then, New Mexico State has appeared in the NCAA Tournament twice and claimed the Western Athletic Conference regular season crown once. Ward left at the end of the 2014 season as the winningest coach in NMSU history (455), the most All-Americans (10), the most post season appearances (11), the most NCAA tournament appearances (3).

It is based on allele-specific oligo extension and fluorescence resonance energy transfer for signal generation. A single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) occurs when a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence differs between members of the same species or a paired chromosome. SNPs work as molecular markers that help locate genes associated with disease and are used for genotype sequencing. Genotyping by next generation sequencing using SNPs is expensive, time-consuming, and has some missing data. There are many other SNP techniques that can be used depending on the purpose of the research considering throughput, data turnaround time, ease of use, performance (sensitivity, reliability, reproducibility, accuracy) flexibility, requirements, and cost. For the highest throughput for large scale studies, it is best to choose multiplexed chip-based technology. Multiplex technologies generate anywhere from 100 to over a million SNPs per run but are not economical to use for small to moderate numbers of SNPs. For a smaller number of SNPs, a uniplex assay like KASP can be used. Methodology There are three components that are critical to the KASP assay: 1) a purified DNA sample, 2) two allele-specific forward primers, and 3) a common reverse primer. A minimum of 5-10 ng of the extracted DNA sample is required for the method to function properly. The DNA sample is purified by adding a mixture of chemicals to the buffer solution. In the first round of PCR, a KASP primer mix that contains the two allele-specific forward primers and the single reverse primer is added to the mixture. The specific nature of the forward primers allows for the primer to bind solely at the SNP of interest, allowing DNA polymerase to lay down the rest of the complementary nucleotides. During this time, the common reverse primer begins to lay down complementary nucleotides on the opposite strand of DNA. This ends the first round of PCR. In the second round of PCR, the complementary strand to the allele-specific forward primer is generated when the common reverse primer binds to the amplicon formed in the first round of PCR. Finally, the thermocycling of the PCR reaction continues, starting the third portion of the KASP method. A fluorescently labeled primer is present in the master mix where it is quenched due to hybridization with its complementary part that has a quencher at the end. The fluorescent-labelled primer complements the tail sequence of the allele- specific forward primer, allowing for elongation to occur. This occurs multiple times throughout the thermocycling settings and the fluorescent signalling becomes stronger as more fluorescent primers are used in the amplification process. Fluorescent tags normally used are FAM and HEX Advantages and disadvantages The KASP method is more cost-effective than multiplex methods--$15 per assay versus $50 per assay. There is also a much shorter turn around time to receive the results with the KASP method than other multiplex methods‚Äî24 hours versus a week. Additionally, there is a lower genotyping error rate of 0.7-1.6%. The KASP method is more flexible than other methods in that it can be used when there are many SNPs in a few samples or when there are few SNPs in many samples. However, the multiplex methods are currently the most high-throughput platforms for SNP genotyping. Applications This technology has many applications in quality control (QC) genotyping, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, marker-assisted selection (MARS), and allele mining. For example, the KASP platform has been used in qualitative control analyses for maize. In maize, homogeneity is important in cultivating the crops that the grower had selected. Slight variations in allelic frequencies may have large impacts on the crop's quality and can occur in a variety of ways including through cross-contamination of pollen and/or seeds and in seed regeneration. QC analysis can be used at the various events in which changes in allelic frequency can be expected so long as samples are taken from the parental and the F1 crop generations. This ensures that the allele frequencies haven't changed much between the two generations and ensures the purity of the line based on the set SNPs for the maize. For maize there have been between 50-100 SNPs identified that can be used to conduct this type of analysis. Quality analysis (QC analysis) is used to maintain the purity of the inbred line. QC genotype protocol uses 50-100 SNPs to determine non-homogeneity within a sample and establish genetic identity. QC can be used at any time during the breeding. If QC is to be used for mapping population non-parental alleles are discarded and alleles for which more than 90% of SNPs are polymorphic between the parents are kept. =QTL mapping= QTL mapping identifies a subset of markers that are significantly associated with one or more QTL influencing the expression of the trait of interest. # Select or develop a bi-parental mapping population. # Phenotype the population for a trait under greenhouse or field conditions. # Choose a molecular marking system ‚Äì genotype parents of the mapping population and F1s with large numbers of markers, then select 200-400 markers exhibiting polymorphism between the parents. # Choose a genotyping approach, then generate molecular data for polymorphic markers # Identify the molecular markers associated with major QTL using statistical programs. For QTL mapping in maize: # use KASP to genotype parents and F1s with 1250 SNPs # Identify the polymorphic SNPs # Genotype the entire population with polymorphic SNPs References DNA ","title":"Kompetitive allele specific PCR"},{"id":"42441663","text":"Blastobasis syrmatodes is a moth in the family Blastobasidae.

The present unreleased but working draft of AC 25.1309-1 is the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee recommended revision B-Arsenal Draft (2002); the present released version is A (1988). The FAA and EASA have accepted proposals by type certificate applicants to use the Arsenal Draft on recent development programs.Spitzer, Cary R., ed, Digital Avionics Handbook, 2nd ed., Avionics, Development and Implementation, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 2007,p. 7-9.AC 25-19A , Certification Maintenance Requirements, 2011, p. 2 AC 25.1309-1 establishes the principle that the more severe the hazard resulting from a system or equipment failure, the less likely that failure must be. Failures that are catastrophic must be extremely improbable.  Airworthiness standards  The airworthiness requirements for transport category airplanes are contained in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 25 (commonly referred to as part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)). Manufacturers of transport category airplanes must show that each airplane they produce of a given type design complies with the relevant standards of part 25. AC 25.1309-1 describes acceptable means for showing compliance with those airworthiness requirements. It recognizes Aerospace Recommended Practices ARP4754 and ARP4761 (or their successors) as such means:Spitzer, p. 7-9 *ARP4754A, Guidelines For Development Of Civil Aircraft and Systems, is a guideline from SAE International, dealing with the development processes which support certification of Aircraft systems. This ARP further recognizes integration of DO-297, DO-178, and DO-254 into the guidelines for development and recognizes ARP5150/5151 as guidelines for in-service operation and maintenance. *ARP4761, Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process On Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment  Background  AC 25.1309-1 provides background for important concepts and issues within airplane system design and analysis. ;Catastrophic failure condition rate The circular provides a rationale for the upper limit for the Average Probability per Flight Hour for Catastrophic Failure Conditions of 1 x 10‚àí9 or \\"Extremely Improbable\\".AC 25.1309-1B Arsenal Draft (), 2002, p. 5-6. Failure Conditions having less severe effects could be relatively more likely to occur; that is, an inverse relationship between severity and likelihood. ;Fail-Safe Design Concept This AC presents the FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept, which applies basic objectives pertaining to failures: #Failures of any system should be assumed for any given flight regardless of probability and such failures \\"should not prevent continued safe flight and landing\\" or otherwise significantly reduce safety. #Subsequent failure during the same flight should also be assumed. The AC lists design principles or techniques used to ensure a safe design. Usually, a combination of at least two safe design techniques are needed to provide a fail-safe design; i.e. to ensure that Major Failure Conditions are Remote, Hazardous Failure Conditions are Extremely Remote, and Catastrophic Failure Conditions are Extremely Improbable. {|style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" |+ Safe Design Principles and Techniques |style=\\"width:240px;\\"*Designed Integrity and Quality *Redundancy or Backup Systems *Isolation and/or Segregation of Systems, Components, and Elements *Proven Reliability *Failure Warning or Indication |style=\\"width:200px;\\"*Flight crew Procedures *Checkability *Designed Failure Effect Limits *Designed Failure Path *Margins or Factors of Safety *Error-Tolerance |} ;Highly integrated systems With emergence of highly integrated systems that perform complex and interrelated functions, particularly through the use of electronic technology and software- based techniques [e.g., Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) ], concerns arose that traditionally quantitative functional-level design and analysis techniques previously applied to simpler systems were no longer adequate. As such the AC includes expanded, methodical approaches, both qualitative and quantitative, that consider the integration of the \\"whole airplane and its systems\\".AC 25.1309-1B-Arsenal Draft, p. 7.  Definitions and Classifications  A main task of AC 25.1309-1 is to provide standard definitions of terms (including hazard and probability classifications) for consistent use throughout the framework set up for the accomplishment of functional airplane safety. Where regulations (FAR) and standards (ARP) may use such terms as failure condition, and extremely improbable, AC 25.1309-1 defines their specific meanings.AC 25.1309-1B-Arsenal Draft, p. 3. In this respect, AC 25.1309-1 is comparable to ISO 26262-1 Vocabulary, at least in regard to the relative dependent standards. Key definitions include: ;Error, Failures, and Failure Conditions :The re-introduction of Error to the AC recognizes the role of human error (in development, manufacture, operation, or maintenance) as a source of system failures, especially in complex and integrated avionics. The term Failure Conditions provides for a focus on the effects of a failure separate from the causes. ;Classification of failure conditions by severity of effect :Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major, Minor, or No Safety Effect :A Catastrophic Failure condition is one \\"which would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of the airplane.\\" ;Definition of Probability Terms :Extremely Improbable, Extremely Remote, Remote, or Probable :An Extremely Improbable failure condition is one so unlikely that it is not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of all airplanes of one type. Quantitatively, these probability terms are define as follows: Extremely Improbable (10‚àí9 or less), Extremely Remote (10‚àí7 or less), Remote (10‚àí5 or less), Probable (more than 10‚àí5).AC 25.1309-1B-Arsenal Draft, p. 9.  Safety Objectives  Classified failure conditions are assigned qualitative and quantitative safety objectives, giving guidance to development and operation. ;Quantitative The AC defines the acceptable safety level for equipment and systems as installed on the airplane and establishes an inverse relationship between Average Probability per Flight Hour and the severity of Failure Condition effects: #Failure Conditions with No Safety Effect have no probability requirement. #Minor Failure Conditions may be Probable. #Major Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Remote. #Hazardous Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Extremely Remote. #Catastrophic Failure Conditions must be Extremely Improbable. The safety objectives associated with Catastrophic Failure Conditions may be satisfied by demonstrating that: #No single failure will result in a Catastrophic Failure Condition; and #Each Catastrophic Failure Condition is extremely improbable. ;Qualitative The failure conditions Catastrophic through No Safety Effect are assigned Functional and Item Design Assurance Levels A, B, C, D, E, respectively.ARP4754A, Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems, SAE Aerospace, December, 2010, p. 38 History First released in 1982, AC 25.1309-1 has been revised to embody increasing experience in development of airplanes and to address the increasing integration and computerization of aircraft functions. = AC 25.1309-1 (original release) =  Function criticality  AC 25.1309-1 recommended that top-down analysis should identify each system function and evaluate its criticality, i.e., either non-essential, essential, or critical. The terms Error, Failure, and Failure Condition were defined. Functions were classified Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential according to the severity of the failure conditions they could contribute to; but the conditions were not expressly classified. Failures of Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential functions were expected to be, respectively, Extremely Improbable (10-9 or less), Improbable (10-5 or less), or no worse than Probable (10-5). AC 25.1309-1, 1982, p. 3-5.  Qualitative methods  Previously, system safety analysis was quantitative; that is, it was dependent on evaluating the probability of system failures from physical faults of components. But with the increasing use of digital avionics (i.e., software) it was recognized that development error was a significant contributor to system failure. During system certification in the late 1970s, it became clear that the classical statistical methods of safety assessment for flight critical software based systems were not possible. Existing quantitative methods could not predict system failure rates resultant from development errors. Qualitative methods were instead recommended for reducing specification, design, and implementation errors in the development of digital avionics. The guidance of DO-178 (initial release) was recommended by AC 25.1309-1 for development of essential and critical functions implemented in software.AC 25.1309-1, p. 9. = AC 25.1309-1A = AC 25.1309-1A introduced the FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept to this Advisory Circular. AC 25.1309-1A, 1988, p. 2. This revision also introduced recommended design principles or techniques in order to ensure a safe design.AC 25.1309-1A, p. 3.  Classification of failure conditions by severity  The concept of function criticality was replaced with classification of failure conditions according to severity of effects (cf., Probabilistic risk assessment). Failure conditions having Catastrophic, Major, or Minor effects were to have restricted likelihoods, respectively, of Extremely Improbable (10-9 or less), Improbable (10-5 or less), or no worse than Probable (10-5).AC 25.1309-1A, pp. 4,5,7, 13-15. Software was still considered to be assessed and controlled by other means; that is, by RTCA/DO-178A or later revision, via Advisory Circular AC 20-115A.AC 25.1309-1A, p. 7. = AC 25 1309-1B = In May 1996, the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was tasked with a review of harmonized FAR/JAR 25.1309, AC 1309-1A, and related documents, and to consider revision to AC 1309-1A incorporating recent practice, increasing complex integration between aircraft functions and the systems that implement them,ARP4754A, p. 7 and the implications of new technology. This task was published in the Federal Register at 61 FR 26246-26247 (1996-05-24). The focus was to be on safety assessment and fault-tolerant critical systems. In 2002, the FAA provided a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) relevant to 14 CFR Part 25. Accompanying this notice is the Arsenal draft of AC 1309-1.Revised General Function and Installation Requirements for Equipment, Systems, and Installations on Transport Category Airplanes, Notice of proposed rulemaking, Draft R6X Phase 1 ‚Äì June 2002, also known as the Arsenal Draft of AC 25.1309-1B Existing definitions and rules in ¬ß 25.1309 and related standards have posed certain problems to the certification of transport category airplanes. Said problems are discussed at length within the NPRM. The FAA proposed revisions to several related standards in order to eliminate such problems and to clarify the intent of these standards. In some proposed changes, definitions or conventions developed in lower level regulations or standards were adopted or revised within the subsequent Advisory Circular.  Refinement of failure condition classifications  Experience in application of the prior circulars and ARPs witnessed the division of the Major failure condition into two conditions (for example, Hazardous- severe/Major and Major).RTCA/DO-178B (subsequently DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics, December 1, 1992, p. 7 Additionally, this experience recognised the existence of failure conditions that have no effect on safety, which could be so classified and thereby assigned no safety objectives. Catastrophic Failure Condition was previously defined as \\"any failure condition which would prevent continued safe flight and landing\\"; but is now defined as \\"Failure conditions which would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of the airplane.AC 25.1309-1B-Arsenal Draft, p. 8.\\"  Extension of qualitative controls to aircraft functions  The FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept and design principles or techniques for safe design are maintained. However, owing to the increasing development of Highly Integrated Systems in aircraft, qualitative controls previously considered necessary for safe software development are extended to the aircraft function level. (Similar guidance (Functional Safety framework) has been provided for highly integrated automotive systems through the 2011, release of ISO 26262.)

Biography Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin was born in Paris on 17 January 1791, the son of a tradesman. Intending to enter commerce, he attended the Coll√®ge des Quatre- Nations. There he learned Arabic, Armenian, Persian, Syriac and Turkish, plus the basics of several other languages such as Zend and Georgian. By the age of 20 he had already acquired a solid theory and spoken fluency in Armenian and Arabic. On 2 September 1820 he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres, part of the Institut de France. He later entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1822 he was one of the founders of the Soci√©t√© Asiatique, and directed the publication of its journal, the Journal Asiatique. In 1824 he was appointed director of the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal. He was responsible for inducing the French government to send the researcher Friedrich Eduard Schulz to the Lake Van region of Armenia in 1827, and in 1828 published Schulz's first report on the remains of the hitherto unknown Urartian civilization. Saint-Martin died of cholera in Paris on 17 July 1832 during the second pandemic. =Contribution to the decipherment of cuneiform= The early attempts at deciphering Old Persian cuneiform were made by M√ºnter and Grotefend by guesswork only, using Achaemenid cuneiform inscriptions found in Persepolis. In 1802, Friedrich M√ºnter realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for ‚Äúking‚Äù (, now known to be pronounced x≈°ƒÅyaœëiya). Georg Friedrich Grotefend extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by ‚Äúgreat king, king of kings‚Äù and the name of the king's father.Kent, R. G.: \\"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950. This, related to the known chronology of the Achaemenid and the relative sizes of each royal names, allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son Xerxes. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Rosetta Stone. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history. Grotefend published his deductions in 1802, but they were dismissed by the Academic community. It was only in 1823 that Grotefend's discovery was confirmed, when the French archaeologist Champollion, who had just deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs, had the idea of deciphering the quadrilingual hieroglyph-cuneiform inscription on the famous alabaster vase in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, the Caylus vase. The Egyptian inscription on the vase turned out to be in the name of King Xerxes I, and Saint-Martin, who accompanied Champollion, was able to confirm that the corresponding words in the cuneiform script (êéßêèÅêéπêé†êéºêèÅêé† êèê êèã êèê êé∫êèÄêéºêé£, X≈°ayƒÅr≈°ƒÅ : X≈† : vazraka, \\"Xerxes : The Great King\\") were indeed using the words which Grotefend had identified as meaning \\"king\\" and \\"Xerxes\\" through guesswork.Pages 10-14, note 1 on page 13 The findings were published by A.J. Saint-Martin in Extrait d'un m√©moire relatif aux antiques inscriptions de Pers√©polis lu √† l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres.In Journal asiatique II, 1823, PI. II, pp. 65‚Äî90 Saint-Martin attempted to define an Old Persian cuneiform alphabet, of which 10 letters were correct, on a total of 39 signs he had identified.

Background Petitioner, a corporate citizen of Virginia, entered into a contract to build a child development center in Fort Hood, Texas.Atlantic Marine Construction, slip op. at 2 (noting that Atlantic Marine's principal place of business was in Virginia). The Petitioner then entered into a subcontract with a Texas corporation for work on the project.Atlantic Marine Construction, slip op. at 2.

When a dispute arose under the contract, the Texas corporation filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, invoking that court's diversity jurisdiction. The Petitioner moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds that venue was \\"wrong\\" under 28 U.S.C. 1406(a) and \\"improper\\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), citing the contract's forum selection clause.

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to grant a writ of mandamus directing the district court to grant either motion.Atlantic Marine Construction, slip op. at 3.

The municipality originally included almost all of the island of Rad√∏y, the northern part of the island of Holsn√∏y, and all the islands of northern √òygarden. Over time, the municipality was reduced in size several times, so that by 1964, it was just the central part of Rad√∏y island. The administrative centre was the village of Manger where Manger Church is located. History The parish of Manger was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law).

It is located about three miles west of Falls City, in the Central Oregon Coast Range on the Little Luckiamute River. Background Louis Gerlinger came to Polk County in 1903 and bought 7,000 acres of timberland that included the area of Black Rock. In 1905, Gerlinger's son George T. Gerlinger bought an existing sawmill in nearby Dallas as well as the right-of-way to build a logging railroad into the Black Rock area. He had previously built a logging railroad from Vancouver to Yacolt in Washington. History and demise Black Rock, founded in 1905, became the western terminus of the Salem, Falls City and Western Railway (later the Southern Pacific Railroad's Falls City branchline), which hauled timber into Dallas. The locale was probably named for an exposed ledge of black shale. Black Rock post office was established in 1906, with Louis Gerlinger as the first postmaster. Some people who worked in the Black Rock area lived there, while others came from Falls City or Dallas. As the town grew, it eventually had three stores, a drug store, a barber shop, a restaurant, two saloons, a one- room schoolhouse, bunkhouses and cook houses for single men, living quarters for families, and a train depot. The town of Black Rock was platted in 1910 by Charles K. Spaulding, with 22 blocks and lettered and numbered streets. High population estimates vary from 600 to 1500. Black Rock grew quickly between 1905 and 1913, as lumber companies located in the area to access the vast stands of Douglas fir and other timber of western Polk County. In 1910, beside the Gerlingers' Dallas Lumber Company, three other companies‚ÄîGreat Western Lumber Company, Falls City Lumber Company, and Charles K. Spaulding Lumber Company‚Äîoperated in Black Rock. The Jay S. Hamilton Lumber Company was operating in Black Rock in 1915. By 1913, the area's timber resources were already being depleted and as the lumber companies began to move out, the town began a steady decline. The post office closed in 1943, and Black Rock and the 19,000 acres surrounding it were incorporated into the U.S. tree farm system. Part of the tree farm burned in 1945 but it was replanted. By 1960, the town only had a log dump and a security guard. The railroad was abandoned in 1960, and logs were hauled to the mills using trucks; at some point the railroad tracks were removed. Although the USGS classifies Black Rock as a populated place, today there is nothing at the former townsite, which is entirely forested except for two mill ponds. Mountain biking The former George T. Gerlinger State Forest is nearby‚Äîit is now the site of a popular mountain biking area managed jointly by the Black Rock Mountain Bike Association and the Oregon Department of Forestry. The Black Rock trails are the first sanctioned freeride area in the state.

More specifically, shadow heaps make use of the shadow merge algorithm to achieve insertion in O(f(n)) amortized time and deletion in O((log n log log n)/f(n)) amortized time, for any choice of 1 ‚â§ f(n) ‚â§ log log n. Throughout this article, it is assumed that A and B are binary heaps with |A‚â§ |B|. Shadow merge Shadow merge is an algorithm for merging two binary heaps efficiently if these heaps are implemented as arrays. Specifically, the running time of shadow merge on two heaps A and B is O(|A+ \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\log |B\\\\log \\\\log |B|, \\\\log |A\\\\log |B|\\\\\\\\}). =Algorithm= We wish to merge the two binary min-heaps A and B. The algorithm is as follows: # Concatenate the array A at the end of the array B to obtain an array C. # Identify the shadow of A in C; that is, the ancestors of the last |Anodes in C which destroy the heap property. # Identify the following two parts of the shadow from C: #* The path P: the set of nodes in the shadow for which there are at most 2 at any depth of C; #* The subtree T: the remainder of the shadow. # Extract and sort the smallest |Pnodes from the shadow into an array S. # Transform S as follows: #* If |S> |C|, then starting from the smallest element in the sorted array, sequentially insert each element of S into C, replacing them with C's smallest elements. #* If |S\\\\leq |C|, then extract and sort the |Psmallest elements from C, and merge this sorted list with S. # Replace the elements of S into their original positions in C. # Make a heap out of T. =Running time= Again, let P denote the path, and T denote the subtree of the concatenated heap C. The number of nodes in P is at most twice the depth of C, which is O(\\\\log |B|). Moreover, the number of nodes in T at depth d is at most 3/4 the number of nodes at depth d + 1, so the subtree has size O(|A|). Since there are at most 2 nodes at each level on P, then reading the smallest |Pelements of the shadow into the sorted array S takes O(\\\\log |B|) time. If |S> |C|, then combining P and C as in step 5 above takes time O(\\\\log |A\\\\log |B|). Otherwise, the time taken in this step is O(|A+ \\\\log |B\\\\log \\\\log |B|). Finally, making a heap of the subtree T takes O(|A|) time. This amounts to a total running time for shadow merging of O(|A+ \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\log |A\\\\log |B|, \\\\log |B\\\\log \\\\log |B|\\\\\\\\}). Structure A shadow heap H consists of threshold function f(H), and an array for which the usual array-implemented binary heap property is upheld in its first entries, and for which the heap property is not necessarily upheld in the other entries. Thus, the shadow heap is essentially a binary heap B adjacent to an array A. To add an element to the shadow heap, place it in the array A. If the array becomes too large according to the specified threshold, we first build a heap out of A using Floyd's algorithm for heap construction, and then merge this heap with B using shadow merge. Finally, the merging of shadow heaps is simply done through sequential insertion of one heap into the other using the above insertion procedure. Analysis We are given a shadow heap H = (B, A), with threshold function \\\\log |H\\\\leq f(H) \\\\leq \\\\log |H\\\\log \\\\log |Has above. Suppose that the threshold function is such that any change in |Binduces no larger a change than in f(H). We derive the desired running time bounds for the mergeable heap operations using the potential method for amortized analysis. The potential \\\\Psi(H) of the heap is chosen to be: :\\\\Psi(H) = |A(1 + \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\log |B\\\\log \\\\log |B|, \\\\log |B\\\\log |A|\\\\\\\\}/f(H)) Using this potential, we can obtain the desired amortized running times: create(H): initializes a new empty shadow heap H :Here, the potential \\\\Psi is unchanged, so the amortized cost of creation is O(1), the actual cost. insert(x, H): inserts x into the shadow heap H :There are two cases: :*If the merge is employed, then the drop in the potential function is exactly the actual cost of merging B and A, so the amortized cost is O(1). :*If the merge is not done, then the amortized cost is O(1 + \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\log |B\\\\log \\\\log |B|, \\\\log |B\\\\log |A|\\\\\\\\}/f(H)) :By choice of the threshold function, we thus obtain that the amortized cost of insertion is: :O(\\\\log |H\\\\log \\\\log |H|/f(H)) delete_min(H): deletes the minimum priority element from H :Finding and deleting the minimum takes actual time O(|A+ \\\\log |B|). Moreover, the potential function can only increase after this deletion if the value of f(H) decreases. By choice of f, we have that the amortized cost of this operation is the same as the actual cost. Related algorithms & data structures A naive binary heap merging algorithm will merge the two heaps A and B in time O(|B|) by simply concatenating both heaps and making a heap out of the resulting array using Floyd's algorithm for heap construction. Alternatively, the heaps can simply be merged by sequentially inserting each element of A into B, taking time O(|A\\\\log |B|). Sack and Strothotte proposed an algorithm for merging the binary heaps in O(|A+ \\\\log |A\\\\log |B|) time.. Their algorithm is known to be more efficient than the second naive solution described above roughly when |A> \\\\log |B|. Shadow merge performs asymptotically better than their algorithm, even in the worst case. There are several other heaps which support faster merge times. For instance, Fibonacci heaps can be merged in O(1) time. Since binary heaps require \\\\Omega(|A|) time to merge, shadow merge remains efficient.

The aim of the K-D-B- tree is to provide the search efficiency of a balanced k-d tree, while providing the block-oriented storage of a B-tree for optimizing external memory accesses.  Informal description  Much like the k-d tree, a K-D-B- tree organizes points in k-dimensional space, useful for tasks such as range- searching and multi-dimensional database queries. K-D-B-trees subdivide space into two subspaces by comparing elements in a single domain. Using a 2-D-B- tree (2-dimensional K-D-B-tree) as an example, space is subdivided in the same manner as a k-d tree: using a point in just one of the domains, or axes in this case, all other values are either less than or greater than the current value, and fall to the left and right of the splitting plane respectively. Unlike a k-d tree, each half-space is not its own node. Instead, as in a B-tree, nodes in the K-D-B-tree are stored as pages and the tree stores a pointer to the root page.  Structure  The basic structure of a K-D-B-tree. The K-D-B-tree contains two types of pages: * Region pages: A collection of (region, child) pairs containing a description of the bounding region along with a pointer to the child page corresponding to that region. * Point pages: A collection of (point, location) pairs. In the case of databases, location may point to the index of the database record, while for points in k-dimensional space, it can be seen as the point's coordinates in that space. Page overflows occur when inserting an element into a K-D-B-tree results in the size of a node exceeding its optimal size. Since the purpose of the K-D-B- tree is to optimize external memory accesses like those from a hard-disk, a page is considered to have overflowed or be overfilled if the size of the node exceeds the external memory page size. Throughout insertion/deletion operations, the K-D-B-tree maintains a certain set of properties: * The graph is a multi-way tree. Region pages always point to child pages, and can not be empty. Point pages are the leaf nodes of the tree. * Like a B-tree, the path length to the leaves of the tree is the same for all queries. * The regions that make up a region page are disjoint. * If the root is a region page the union of its regions is the entire search space. * When the child of a (region, child) pair in a region page is also a region page, the union of all the regions in the child is region. * Conversely in the case above, if child is a point page, all points in child must be contained in region.  Operations on a K-D-B-tree  = Queries = Queries on a K-D-B-tree are a range search over intervals in all domains or axes in the tree. This collection of intervals is called the query region. In k-space, the query region can be visualized as a bounding volume around some subspace in the entire k-dimensional search space. A query can fall into one of three categories: * Some intervals span an entire domain or axis, making the query a partial range query. * Some intervals are points, the others full domains, and so the query is a partial match query. * The intervals are all points, and so the bounding volume is also just a point. This is an exact match query.  Algorithm  # If the root of the tree is null, terminate, otherwise let page be root. # If page is a point page, return every point in a (point, location) pair that lies within the query region. # Otherwise, page is a region page, so for all (region, child) pairs where region and query region intersect, set page to be child and recurse from step 2. = Insertions = Since an insertion into a K-D-B-tree may require the splitting of a page in the case of a page overflow, it is important to first define the splitting operation.  Splitting algorithm  First, a region page is split along some plane to create two new region pages, the left and right pages. These pages are filled with the regions from the old region page, and the old region page is deleted. Then, for every (region, child) in the original region page, remembering child is a page and region specifies an actual bounding region: # If region lies entirely to the left of the splitting plane, add (region, child) to the left page. # If region lies entirely to the right of the splitting plane, add (region, child) to the right page. # Otherwise: ## Recursively split child by the splitting plane, resulting in the pages new_left_page and new_right_page ## Split region by the splitting plane, resulting in left_region and right_region ## Add (left_region, new_left_page) to the left page, and (right_region, new_right_page) to the right page.  Insertion algorithm  The importance of choosing the correct splitting domain. Using the splitting algorithm, insertions of a new (point, location) pair can be implemented as follows: # If the root page is null, simply make the root page a new point page containing (point, location) # If an exact match query on point to find the page that point' should be added to. If it already exists in the page, terminate. # Add (point, location) to the page. If the page overflows, let page denote that page. # Let old_page be equal to page. Choose some element and a domain/axis to define a plane to split page by that results in two pages that will not also result in one of the pages being overfilled with the addition of a new point. Split page by the plane to make two new pages, new_left_page and new_right_page, and two new regions left_region and right_region. # If page was the root page, go to step 6. Otherwise, page becomes the parent of page. Replace (region, old_page) in page with (left_region, new_left_page) and (right_region, new_right_page). If page overflows, repeat step 4, otherwise terminate. # Let left_region be the entire search space to the left of the splitting plane, and right_region be the search space to the right, resulting from the split in Step 4. Set the root page to be a page containing to the regions left_region and right_region. It is important to take care in the domain and element chosen to split page by, since it is desirable to try to balance the number of points on either side of the splitting plane. In some cases, a poor choice of splitting domain can result in undesirable splits. It is also possible that a page cannot be split by a certain domain. = Deletions = Deletions from a K-D-B-tree are incredibly simple if no minimum requirements are placed on storage utilization. Using an exact match query to find a (point, location) pair, we simply remove the record from the tree if it exists.  Reorganization algorithm  Since deletions can result in pages that contain very little data, it may be necessary to reorganize the K-D-B-tree to meet some minimum storage utilization criteria. The reorganization algorithm to be used when a page contains too little data is as follows: # Let page be the parent of P, containing (region, P). # Find regions in page such that the regions are adjacent and the union of which forms a rectangular region. These regions are considered \\"joinable\\". Let R denote the set of these regions. # Merge the set R into one page S, and if the S is overfull, repeatedly split until none of the resulting pages are overfull. # Replace the set R of regions in page with the resulting pages from splitting S.  Related work  Like in a k-d tree, updates in a K-D-B-tree may result in the requirement for the splitting of several nodes recursively. This is incredibly inefficient and can result in sub-optimal memory utilization as it may result in many near-empty leaves. Lomet and Salzberg proposed a structure called the hB-tree (holey brick tree) to improve performance of K-D-B-trees by limiting the splits that occur after an insertion to only one root-to-leaf path. This was achieved by storing regions not only as rectangles, but as rectangles with a rectangle removed from the center. =BKD tree= More recently, the Bkd-tree was proposed as a means to provide the fast queries and near 100% space utilization of a static K-D-B-tree. Instead of maintaining a single tree and re-balancing, a set of \\\\log_{2} (N/M) K-D-B-trees are maintained and rebuilt at regular intervals. In this case, M is the size of the memory buffer in number of points.

It is part of the Mount Sinai Health System, a nonprofit health system formed in September 2013 by the merger of Continuum Health Partners and Mount Sinai Medical Center, and an academic affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. History Beth Israel is Hebrew for \\"House of Israel.\\" The hospital was incorporated at Beth Israel Hospital on May 28, 1890 by a group of 40 Orthodox Jews on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, each of whom paid 25 cents to set up a hospital dedicated to serving immigrant Jews living in the tenement slums of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At the time, most of New York's hospitals would not treat patients who had been in the city less than a year. It initially opened a dispensary at 206 Broadway in 1891, and moved to Jefferson and Cherry Streets in 1895. On March 12, 1929, it moved to First Avenue and 16th Street, facing Stuyvesant Square, and the old building was converted into an old age home, the Home of Old Israel. It purchased its neighbor Manhattan General Hospital in 1964 and was renamed Beth Israel Medical Center on March 10, 1965. Beth Israel Medical Center as seen from Stuyvesant Square By then it had extended beyond its Jewish base and served the entire population of Lower Manhattan including Manhattan's Lower East Side, Chinatown, Gramercy, the West Village, Chelsea. In 1988 it had the largest network of heroin-treatment clinics in the United States with 7,500 patients and 23 facilities. It acquired Doctors Hospital on the Upper East Side in the 1990s, renaming it Beth Israel Medical Center-Singer Division, and Kings Highway Hospital Center in Brooklyn in 1995, renaming it Beth Israel Medical Center-Kings Highway Division. In 2004, the Singer Division closed and the Manhattan inpatient operations were consolidated in the buildings on First Avenue at 16th Street in Manhattan. As of 2010 Mount Sinai Beth Israel had residency training programs in nearly every major field of medicine including Emergency Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Otolaryngology, Oral and maxillofacial surgery, Radiology, Family Medicine, Dermatology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Neurology, Ophthalmology, Pathology, Psychiatry, Podiatry, and Urology. Mount Sinai Beth Israel also has a department of Chiropractic, Music Therapy, and Acupuncture. On November 22, 2013 the name of Beth Israel Medical Center was changed to Mount Sinai Beth Israel as a part of the merger with Mount Sinai to form the Mount Sinai Health System. On May 25, 2016, Mount Sinai announced a significant restructuring and downsizing, with plans to build a new hospital with only 70 inpatient beds on a site several blocks away. This is expected to take over four years, after which the main hospital on 16th Street will be closed and that site will be sold. On June 11, 2017, the hospital's Labor and Delivery Department closed. The hospital's \\"Continuum Center for Health and Healing\\" also closed in 2017.

Norman influence appears to have lasted for about 60 years. From around 1310, after the Gaelic resurgence, the town existed well within the Gaelic cultural zone and developed on the Sligeach (Garavogue) river under the O‚ÄôConchobhar Sligigh dynasty and within the Irish t√∫ath of Cairbre Droma Cliabh as part of the Gaelic confederation of Iochtar Connacht (Lower Connacht) until the creation of County Sligo by the English Lord Deputy Henry Sidney in 1561. Origins =Name= The name Sligo is a corruption of the Irish name Sligeach, meaning \\"abounding in shells.\\" It refers to the abundance of shellfish found in the estuary, and from the extensive shell middens along the shores of Sligo bay. The name initially referred only to the river, then was applied to the town and eventually, also the county created in 1561. =Prehistory= see Archaeology of County Sligo Ancient settlement has centred on the bay of Sligo since the first human presence in the area roughly 10,000 years ago as shown by extensive shell middens dating back to the Mesolithic era. The location was also strategic being placed in the narrow gap between Lough Gill and the sea, and also on the narrow coastal corridor that forms the main western route between the provinces of Ulster and Connacht. It is a crossing point of several routes and is a natural meeting-place. Sligo is on several fords across the Garavogue river. The town follows a ridge of higher ground paralleling the river on the south side, and the High street appears to follow the course of a stream leading to the river. The area saw intense activity in the late 5th and early 4th millennium BC. The town is surrounded by Neolithic archaeological remains, some of which are within the urban area. An outlier of the extensive early Neolithic cemetery at Carrowmore is on the south bank of the Garavogue river above a fording point. The oldest currently known causewayed enclosure in Britain and Ireland is situated on the high ground southwest edge of the town at Magheraboy. The area was densely enough settled to be known to Greek and Roman trading vessels being marked on Ptolemy's co-ordinate map of the 2nd century AD, where it is entered as the town of Nagnata. This is the only settlement marked on the west coast of Ireland by Ptolemy.http://www.tpsalomonreinach.mom.fr/Reinach/MOM_TP_071577/MOM_TP_071577_0005/PDF/MOM_TP_071577_0005.pdf It is possible traders were attracted by the silver and lead mines on the coast at Ballysadare. So where the exact site of Nagnata was remains unknown. =Early Christian= List of monastic houses in County Sligo The present site of the town may have been wooded during the 5th century. \\"That there were woods along the Sligo river,\\" which is mentioned in T√≠rech√°ns Life of Patrick, wherein the saint prophesied that in later times the sea would force people to move from the early church site of Killaspugbrone near Strandhill to the present location of the town further upriver. The local Irish tuath, or territory, was called Cairbre Drom Cliabh or Cr√≠och Cairbre. Another, older name, according to Acallamh na S√©norach was Cr√≠och an Cosn√°mha (The District of Contention). Its age is unknown, but it appears to have acquired the name Cairbre in the 5th or 6th century AD. Gaelic Ireland was not an urban society, but a form of proto-urbanisation was introduced at this time with the development of large monastic centres. Many religious establishments were created in the area during the early Christian period. The Columban monastery at Drumcliff was the largest centre of population from its foundation in 561 AD. The remains now consist of a High Cross and the only round tower in county Sligo. Another early church was at Kilmacowen. By the early 12th century AD there was a bridge and a settlement in existence at the site of the present town. A rath, or ringfort, called Rath na Bhrit√≥g (Fort of the Britons) existed on what is now Holborn hill on the north side of the town, which is in the townland of Rathquarter. Rathedmond also has the remains of a large rath. Norman Era With the Norman invasion of Connacht in 1236 AD by the French speaking Cambro-Norman knights, known as Galls (Gauls) to the Irish came a new type of settlement. The Normans brought the European urban model based on trade and a money economy. Sligo, accessible by sea, and a sheltered port was ideal for Norman military strategy as they, descendants of Vikings, relied on amphibious operations to supply and reinforce their armies. The Normans took advantage of political divisions inherent in Cairbres position on the frontier between the ancient provinces of Ulster and Connacht. After the arrival of the justiciar (representative) of the King of England, Maurice Fitzgerald land was granted to the clergyman Clarus MacMailenn of Lough C√© intended for the construction of a hospital. The building materials were gathered, but the order was then switched to a castle by Fitzgerald, who having the upper hand, ordered the building of a castle to secure the position. Fedlim O'Conchobar, King of Connacht was ordered to build a castle by Maurice Fitzgerald, the Norman baron and warrior. Maurice used the castle as a base to invade Tir Conaill (Donegal). Warfare for control of Sligo castle was to become a constant feature from the building of the first castle in 1245, until the destruction of it which was still standing in 1691. (see Sligo Castle) The exact location and layout of Sligo castle remains unknown, as no trace now exists above ground. It is thought to have stood in Quay street, in the vicinity, or on the site of the present city hall. This area became known as Castlequarter. The foundation of Sligo abbey, (actually a Dominican friary) in 1253 was followed by the clustering outside the abbey gates of houses of those providing services, or selling goods to the monks. The east side of the town surrounding the abbey became known as Abbeyquarter after The Holy Cross Dominican Friary. The Dominicans were a mendicant order, reliant on alms, and who preached to the poor of the towns. A monastery was built and a cemetery consecrated for the Preaching-friars in Sligo. This is the founding of the Abbey on Abbey street, Sligo town. The Preaching-friars marked out the site of another monastery at Ath Lethan. In 1257 Maurice Fitzgerald was mortally wounded at the battle of Credran Cille to the north of the town near Ballincar. The Berminghams seized control of Tir FhiacrachUltimately, the Normans failed to retain control of the area despite numerous efforts, and were permanently expelled by about 1315. They had nonetheless, succeeded in laying the foundations for the modern town of Sligo which retains certain Norman characteristics to this day. The High street with a flare and market cross is typical of Norman urban layouts, as are the narrow burgage plots running at right angles to many streets are typical of Norman architecture and planning. They also brought their extensive merchant contacts with England, France and Spain which enhanced the wine trade and led to the development of the medieval Sligo port. Gaelic Era Sligo is unique in Ireland as the only Norman medieval town to have been under Gaelic Irish control throughout the Medieval period, from around 1300 to 1600 AD. With the Europe wide slow down in urbanisation in the mid 14th century, and the Gaelic cultural resurgence, the town functioned as the centre of the Gaelic confederation of √çochtar Connacht. Sligo town flourished during the Gaelic revival in the 14th and 15th centuries, trading with Galway and with French, Spanish and English merchants. Herring seems to have been an important commodity as it is mentioned in a Bristol sailors song of the early 15th century. At this time, Sligo was a prosperous trading port, exporting fish, wool, cow hide, and timber, while importing wine, salt and iron. Saffron was imported as well, for its use as a dye as well as indigo which is mentioned as a common colour for clothing in the Sligo area. The cocket of the port was a coveted income, much fought over between rival local dynasties. Several merchants tower houses were built near the abbey and along Castle street. The Gaelic merchant family the O‚Äô Creans operated from Sligo. The castle and the variegated door. Horse races were held in the town in front of the castle at this time. On Castle Point on the east side of Half Moon Bay at Annagh (Eanach) now known as Hazelwood is the site of a castle of O' Conchobar Sligigh. This area was the lucht tighe, household or demesne land of the chiefs of Cairbre Drom Cliabh. Sligo castle was in the hands of O Conor Sligo and was the ‚Äúgreatest i have seen in the hands of any Irishman‚Äù according to Henry Sidney. The Leabhar na hUidhre, or Book of the Dun Cow, was kept in Sligo for 170 years after being taken from T√≠rconaill as ransom for the capture of the members of the clan who had been taken prisoner by Cathal √ìg O'Connor. The poet Tadg Dall O‚ÄôhUiginn flourished at this time. =Elizabethan Conquest= During the latter half of the 16th century, Sligo was targeted by the Elizabethan administration in Dublin as a strategic location for anyone attempting to control the northwest. The town now became caught between three different power blocs, the Earls of Clanricard to the west, the O'Donnell confederation T√≠rconaill to the north, and the Dublin government under the English Crown in the east. The town was destroyed during the Nine Years' War. Under pressure from the O'Donnell's to the north, and the Clanricard Burkes to the south, in 1567, under the policy of surrender and regrant Domhnall O' Conchobar signed an agreement with Henry Sidney, agreeing to pay a set rent in exchange for protection. It was at this time that Sidney \\"shired\\" the area creating the English district known as County Sligo. As part of this agreement, O 'Connor had to allow a sheriff to operate in the county and the circuit court to administer according to English common law. Several sheriffs were killed trying to implement this. In 1577 Sir Nicholas Malby, the English President of Connacht, reported that merchants based in Sligo had requested the building of town walls.http://irishsettlement.ie/wp- content/uploads/2010/05/Newsletter-1996-7.pdf In 1588 three ships of the Spanish Armada's Levant squadron were lost off the coast of Streedagh beach in the north of the present county Sligo. The wreck-site was rediscovered in 1985. An account of the incident was written by the survivor Captain Francisco de Cuellar- 17th century The town was granted a charter in 1613 under James I. it became the principal town of the newly created County of Sligo. This marked a new phase as a borough and colonial administrative centre of English rule. Initially, using the abbey because its stone walls were defensible, the new High Sheriff Sir Roger Jones, established the new county administration along what is now Teeling St. Later, a new fortified tower was built nearby, known as Jones castle. The present courthouse and Garda station are in the same location. Remains of corner \\"flanker\\" of fortified house, uncovered 2006, possibly Jones' or Creans castle, Teeling St. Sligo English gradually became the majority language in the town, but Irish remained the majority language of the county until the late nineteenth century. =1641 Rebellion= Unhappy with the changed power structure, the local Gaelic nobility rose up during the 1641 rebellion, reestablishing the Irish tuath system. This was to be the last time that Gaelic culture held sway over the region. According to later depositions, a number of Protestant settlers within the town, were committed to the local gaol for their own safety, but were later allegedly massacred by a drunken mob. Fighting with Frederick Hamilton who raided the town and burnt the abbey and executed the monks. The Parliamentary government built a new stone fort, on or near the site of the old castle, and an earthen star fort, known as the Green fort on the hill north of the town, fortifications were also built at the entrance to Sligo shipping channel on Oyster island, and guarding the route inland through Lough Gill on Church island. =Williamite Wars= Sligo changed hands five times during the 1688-1691 Jacobite/Williamite wars. The town was fortified by the infamous soldier Henry Luttrell. The eccentric soldier, Sir Teague O'Regan, was the garrison commander for the Jacobite forces at Sligo. Patrick Sarsfield retook the town. Notably, the last recorded use of a siege tower, known as a sow, in Britain or Ireland, was at the siege of the stone fort in Sligo during this war. It was used to assault the stone fort on Quay St. It was not a success as the hides used to cover the sides were not musket proof. Despite the wars, Gaelic culture remained strong in the area, the poem book Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe was written in Sligo in 1680 for Cormac O‚Äô Neill by the poet R√∫air√≠ √ì hUig√≠nn.https://archive.org/stream/leabharcloinneao00odon#page/n3/mode/2up Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe 18th century The politics were dominated by the big landlords, mostly of military background, such as the Wynnes, who bought a 15,000 acre estate which included the town. The Wynnes seat at Hazelwood house was built in 1722 by Lieutenant General Owen Wynne after a design by Richard Cassels. Other large landowners were the Coopers of Markree, and the Gore Booths of Lissadell Bliain an √Åir (The Year of Destruction) struck in 1740, a famine caused by an unusual severe cold snap, devastating the population. Maynooth Irish MS B 8, by Gaelic learning continued with Henry MacCarrick, a merchant and scholar of Sligo town, who lived on High street and copied the Cuimre na nGeneleach. The town was heavily garrisoned in the 18th century, having four barracks, two horse and two foot. In 1794, Sligo was in turmoil with a campaign of agrarian violence by the Defenders The forces of General Humbert, marched through Sligo county, during the 1798 Rebellion. They fought a battle at Collooney, in which the combined Irish and French force was victorious. Sligo town did not fall to the rebels, however, as Humbert overestimated the size of the garrison present and failed to march on it. The garrison was in fact preparing to abandon it. The Sligo Militia fought at Vinegar hill. 19th century Sligo port began to expand rapidly in the early 19th century. An example of the type of trade is shown in this shipwreck 4 November 1807 the Portuguese brigantine Harmonia on voyage from Oporto to Sligo with cork, wine and oranges was driven ashore at Portreath Cornwall. Emigration was already a feature of the west of Ireland and Sligo port was a busy embarkation point. A shipping advertisement of 1834 for passage to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, New Orleans, Quebec, Montreal and New York, declared The first steamship arrived in Sligo harbour in 1831 belonging to the Glasgow and Liverpool Steam Shipping Company. Messrs Middleton Pollexfen ran sailing ships to Glasgow and Liverpool from 1840 to 1856 when they replaced them with steamers. In 1865 they created the Sligo Steam Navigation Company which lasted until 1936. Sligo gaol was constructed in 1818 based on the panopticon design of Jeremy Bentham. =Disease and famine= Sligo was badly affected by the 1832 Sligo cholera outbreak losing up to 2, 000 of its population. The fear and panic were vividly described by eyewitness Charlotte Blake-Thornley Stoker. Prior to the famine, the population of county Sligo was 187,000 people, making it one of the densest populated areas in Ireland. Sligo was a major transit port for emigration, during An Gorta M√≥r (The Great Famine). In 1846, 11,000 emigrated through the port. Some of the worst coffin ships on record left from Sligo port. On the 9th of August 1847 the vessel Bark Larch arrived at the quarantine station at Grosse Isle, Canada from Sligo with 440 on board, of these, 150 were sick and 108 were dead, this was by far the worst ship at the port that day. Lord Palmerston, who held large estates in the county, achieved notoriety with his Assisted Emigrants scheme. In 1871 between 25% to 50% of the county still spoke Irish as a first language, the county remained rural in character with over 70% involved in agriculture. Landlords controlled almost all aspects of life. The town was on the lands of the Wynne estate based at Hazelwood house. Sligo experienced rapid industrialisation during the 19th century, with many public buildings erected during this era including the town hall, Ulster bank, courthouse. The Local Government Act of 1898 extended the franchise, resulting in the election of a nationalist council. However, business and government posts remained almost exclusively in the hands of Protestants, and the struggle for equality of opportunity was to become a feature of the next century. North Sligo MP P A McHugh was a nationalist and champion of workers rights until his death in 1909. 20th century =Labour movement and strikes= The rapid industrialisation of Sligo, unusual for the west coast, meant that conditions for the working poor were very bad. Houses and businesses were without sanitation facilities. In 1915 the death rate from tuberculosis was 3.4 per 1,000, almost double that of the rest of the country. Indicative of conditions at the time are the reports of a 1901 Local Government Inspector who noted for Corkrans Mall a Trade unions were successful in the early 1900s and flourished between the years 1910 to 1914. In 1911 the ITGWU began organising workers in the town into a unified bloc after the Sligo Trades Council invited Walter Carpenter to speak. So successful was this that Sligo workers won a major strike in 1912, and won again in 1913 when employers tried to break the unions, resulting in the 1913 Sligo Dock strike. Other achievements of the Trades Council included a 50% pay rise for Corporation workers, victory in a cabinetmakers strike, better conditions for women workers, bakers and tailors. By 1914 it was acknowledged by the county Inspector that the ‚ÄúITGWU was in complete control of the docks‚Äù. Sligo Corporation was also almost entirely made up of Labour candidates in 1913 and 1914 and an ITGWU councillor was elected mayor.Nationalism and the Irish Party: Provincial Ireland 1910-1916 Sligo Traded Council had been active since 1895. =Revolution and war= War of Independence Civil War 1919 PR-STV election, Sligo became the first municipality in Britain, or Ireland to use this voting system. Free State and Republic Partition cut the town off from an extensive part of its hinterland in west Fermanagh and south Tyrone and trading contacts with Enniskillen and Belfast. Sligo, whilst not directly on the border, was affected indirectly by the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Further reading  * Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe Edited by Thadhg O' Donnchadha, D.Litt.

Hill, and John Hill, was a political activist and actor who first garnered media attention for his role in the 1971 Attica Prison revolt in upstate New York. Personal life Boncore was born in Buffalo, NY, to a Mohawk/Cree mother and an Italian-American father. His father and eleven co-workers died in 1957 after entering a storage tank at U.S. Rubber without respirators. Boncore's family fell into poverty thereafter and he and five siblings were later sent to foster care after being removed from their mother's care. Boncore was physically abused due to being placed in racist households during his time in foster care and ended up homeless after fighting back against one of his oppressive foster parents. Sent to the juvenile reformatory center in Elmira for robbing a sub shop out of desperation and hunger after sleeping on the streets of New York City. In August 1971, the age of 19, he was transferred to Attica prison to serve the final months of his sentence. During the subsequent trials, Hill married a woman named Alicia, the couple having a baby boy, John Jr., in 1975.Chapter 39, \\"Going for Broke\\", in Blood In The Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy, by Heather Ann Thompson, 2016 In 1993, Boncore met Sandra Bruderer, a Cree woman whom he later married, at a First Nations/Native American sovereignty conference in Edmonton. In 2001, the two self-published a co-written autobiography of Boncore entitled The Autobiography of Splitting the Sky: From Attica to Gustafsen Lake (). Boncore also acted in roles in the TV series Men In Trees, Alice, I Think and Da Vinci's City Hall, and in the films The Last Rites of Ransom Pride (2010) and Deepwater (2005). Attica and political activities Boncore was a leader in the Attica Prison revolt. Although 43 people died during the five-day siege, including ten hostages taken by inmates, Boncore was the only person convicted of murder in the aftermath. Despite a legal defense mounted by famed attorney William Kunstler, Boncore was convicted in 1975 by a jury of the murder of prison guard William Quinn, whom he denied attacking as was claimed, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, in 1976, Boncore was granted clemency by New York governor Hugh Carey. Boncore later joined the American Indian Movement and returned to the media spotlight during the 31-day Gustafsen Lake Standoff by First Nations land claims activists in British Columbia. First Nations people and supporters had come to Gustafsen Lake to hold a Sun Dance on private property there, Boncore was the Sun Dance leader and when an eviction notice was served on the group he called for armed resistance. In 2009, Boncore was arrested while attempting to make a citizen's arrest of former US president George W. Bush in Calgary, Alberta. He had intended to defend himself on the basis that Bush was a war criminal and that the RCMP was bound by law to assist him rather than arrest him. The judge in the case had scheduled 3 days for him to present his defence (he had asked for one). He died before he was able to present his defence. Death On March 13, 2013, Boncore was found dead near his home on the Adams Lake Indian Reserve near Chase, BC. Media reports indicate he is believed to have died on March 12, 2013, after falling on cement steps and possibly suffering a blow to the head. The coroner's office dismissed foul play before a planned autopsy was conducted. Boncore is survived by Sandra Bruderer, six children, and five grandchildren.

The 323rd District Court serves Tarrant County, Texas, as its juvenile court. Boyd, a Republican, assumed office in 1995, but is known for her controversial\\"Deposition Released in Controversial 'Affluenza' Dui Case\\", ABC & News, October 16, 2015. 2013 probation sentencing of Ethan Couch, a 16-year-old who killed four people and injured 11 while driving drunk. Education and career Boyd earned a Bachelor's degree from Texas Tech University and a J.D. degree from South Texas College of Law. She practiced law as a juvenile attorney before becoming an Associate Judge of the 323rd District Court in 1987, and the Presiding Judge of the 323rd District Court in 1995. Boyd chairs the Juvenile Justice Committee of the Judicial Section of the State Bar of Texas, and was a member of the Board of the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission. She chaired the Juvenile Law Section of the State Bar of Texas from 1993 to 1994. Boyd served as President of the Fort Worth-Tarrant Count Young Lawyers Association in 1985, and as President of the Tarrant County Women Lawyer's Association from 1982 to 1983. Couch case Boyd heard the case of Ethan Couch, a sixteen-year-old from a wealthy family who killed four people and injured nine people while driving drunk, in 2013. After accepting his guilty plea, Boyd sentenced Couch to ten years' probation for his crimes, and also ordered him confined to a rehabilitation facility for treatment. Boyd's ruling outraged the families of the victims, and provoked national criticism, especially after news sources revealed that Couch's defense team argued that he was not culpable because he could not understand the consequences of his decisions because of his financial privilege, a condition an expert witness termed \\"affluenza.\\" Boyd herself specifically claimed the \\"affluenza\\" argument did not influence her judgment but, rather, that she merely felt Couch needed treatment and that given his parents' financial position, Couch could get better treatment in a rehabilitation center than in a youth detention center. Boyd did not comment regarding whether the punishment of ten years' probation was appropriate to Couch's crimes of stealing alcohol, being a minor in possession of alcohol, consuming alcohol as a minor, driving drunk, and vehicular manslaughter of four individuals. Critics charged Boyd had given a free pass to Couch because he was white and wealthy, noting that in 2004, Boyd sentenced Eric Miller, a sixteen-year-old from a poor family, to twenty years' imprisonment for killing one person while driving drunk. The 2004 case did differ to some extent from the Couch case, though, in that the defendant in the 2004 case committed a separate felony on the night in question, stealing a truck. However, in Couch's case, he had stolen a truck from his father, which was viewed as a lesser offense. Boyd had intended to pass a similar mandatory rehabilitation sentence in a 2012 case involving a death stemming from a fight, but no rehabilitation program was willing to accept the suspect, who was then subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison. Boyd has a history of long probationary sentences for juveniles and keeping juveniles in the juvenile court system, although at least one juvenile, convicted of murder, was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment following his conviction. A year later, Boyd stepped down from her position officially on December 31, 2014, after serving as judge for 20 years. Two years into the 10-year probation sentence handed down by Boyd, Couch violated his probation and disappeared with his mother.Ashley Fantz, Ben Brumfield and Catherine E.

The students were protesting in response to the April 26 Editorial published by the People's Daily the previous day. The editorial asserted that the student movement was anti-party and contributed to a sense of chaos and destabilization.Zhang Liang, The Tiananmen Papers. eds Perry Link and Andrew J. Nathan. New York: Public Affairs, 2001. p. 73 The content of the editorial incited the largest student protest of the movement thus far in Beijing: 50,000‚Äì200,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing before finally breaking through police lines into Tiananmen Square. Events After the editorial was published, the students at Peking University in Beijing met during the night to discuss their plans for a march on April 27.Josephine T. Khu, \\"Student Organization in the Movement,\\" Chinese Democracy and the Crisis of 1989: Chinese and American Reflections. eds. Roger V.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. p. 49 Some of the authorities in the school tried to coax the students into calling it off; they gave hints that if the students did not protest, then the school officials would use their government connections to begin dialogues.Li Lu, Moving the Mountain: My Life in China From the Cultural Revolution to Tiananmen Square. London: Macmillan, 1990. p. 122Calhoun p. 49 But the students were too upset to stand down, and their enthusiasm to march could not be quelled. They compromised: they would only march part of the way, up to the Third Ring Road, but not all the way to Tiananmen Square itself. One scholar observed that the students thought it would show that they \\"rejected the April 26 editorial but would not constitute a major provocation,\\" because the students were still scared of the government using retaliatory force.Calhoun p. 49 =Locations= Although students had demonstrated before, the April 27 demonstrations were particularly significant, in part because their scale was the largest instance of defying the state since 1949.Kurt Schock, Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 2005. p. 100 Students were protesting across China: \\"not only in cities where demonstrations had already taken place, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Changchun, Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Changsha, Chengdu, and Chongqing, but also in cities where demonstrations now broke out for the first time: Shenyang, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Nanning, Kunming, Shenzhen, Yinchuan, and Guilin.\\" Zhang p. 81 =The Beijing demonstration= The Beijing demonstration was the largest, with one conservative estimate at 30,000 students marching, but most sources claim between 150,000-200,000 were present.Li p. 119 It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of student protesters, however, because there were so many citizens from Beijing cheering them on and supporting them in solidarity . In the words of economist Chu-yuan Cheng, it was the first time that a \\"pro-democracy student protest campaign drew enthusiastic support from the masses.\\"Chu-yuan Cheng. Behind the Tiananmen Massacre: Social, Political, and Economic Ferment in China. Boulder: Westview Press, 1990. p. 126 According to two Canadian journalists, the April 26 editorial had also \\"struck a raw nerve within the general populace\\" and the focus on themes like corruption and inflation stirred the people's sympathy.Scott Simmmie and Bob Nixon, Tiananmen Square. Vancouver: Douglas & MacIntyre, 1989. p. 43 Many of students were carrying signs or banners, not advocating for overthrowing the CPC, which the April 26 editorial had accused them of, but rather focused on democracy and cracking down on corruption.Fang Deng, Unintended Outcomes of Social Movements: The 1989 Chinese Student movement. London: Routledge, 2011. p. 36 According to Chai Ling, a student protester who would later become a leader of the Hunger Strike Group, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation had planned to stage a demonstration in the Square on April 27 even \\"before the government verdict appeared in the People's Daily.\\"Chai Ling, A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, Her Daring Escape, and Her Quest to Free China's Daughters. Tyndale House Publishers, 2011. p. 115 =Interaction between students and the state= Many officials were worried about the size and support of the demonstrations: Yang Shangkun, with Deng Xiaoping's permission, had five hundred troops of Beijing Military Region's Thirty-Eighth Army enter Beijing in case the demonstrations got out of hand.Zhang, p. 81 This was in addition to all the available Beijing police, which included students from the police academy.Zhou Dingxin, The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001. p. 224 But thousands of workers surrounded the soldiers and cut them off from the students; some of the workers even cleared aside police barricades to let the students march onward. The students, marching for fourteen hours, gained more support as they went on, and Canadian journalist Scott Simmie estimated that half a million citizens participated in the demonstration.Simmie, p. 43 Despite the presence of police and military, there was little-to-no violence or altercations between them and the students.Zhang, p. 20 Both sides were self-disciplined, and according to a few observing citizens, some of the students even shook officers' hands and chanted \\"the people's police love the people.\\" Li p. 120 The police did not resort to violence either; they temporarily slowed down the marchers before ultimately stepping aside and letting them pass.Fang, p. 36 There was also little-to-no vandalism or trouble from the students in general: one Chinese bystander remarked that \\"even the vagabonds and thieves were on their good behaviour this time. No one wanted to stir up trouble.\\"Li p. 120 This only served to buoy the students' feelings of elation, and instead of abandoning the march at the Third Ring Road, as planned, their enthusiasm compelled them to continue all the way to Tiananmen Square.Li p. 121 Aftermath From the students' perspective, the April 27 demonstrations were a milestone in the student movement: they realized that they had the potential to make a difference.Khu p. 165 For the first time, the students were speaking for the people and workers; they did not focus solely on the interests of students and intellectuals.Calhoun p. 52 In one scholar's interpretation, the people were unable to protest and demonstrate, so the student demonstrations took on the \\"silent frustrations of the population.\\"Frank Niming, \\"Learning How To Protest,\\" The Chinese People's Movement: Perspectives on Spring 1989. ed. Tony Saich. New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc, 1990. P.90 It was also the first case of when the students faced official resistance, such as police lines and a military presence, whom they interacted with peacefully. The government became more placatory and held dialogues with the students afterwards, which encouraged them to continue protesting.Schock, p. 101 It served to revitalize the movement and inspired the students by showing that their actions had serious consequences. One big-character poster was put up on the next day at People's University, explaining the attitude of the students in the aftermath: \\"those of us who went through the experience agree: the march was a great victory in the process of democratization in China.\\"Calhoun p. 52 This was the immediate sensation of many of the students involved, but their elation was short-lived. The talks with the government would not go well, and the threat of violence would loom over the dialogues. Some observers even claim that these protests were not free from violence. A foreign medical student saw that \\"three or four students were brought into intensive care that evening, badly beaten, one allegedly with a broken back.\\" Timothy Brook, Quelling The People: The Military Suppression of the Beijing Democracy Movement. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 34 After news of this, another student said that \\"'blood will be shed‚Ä¶'where this would happen, or how soon it might come, he could not say, but he felt that it was coming.\\"Brook, p. 34. While violence may not have been inevitable, the events after the April 27 demonstrations did not reflect the students' triumphant attitude at the time. Notes Sources *Brook, Timothy.

Biography Mart√≠nez Sagi was born into a gentried family of Barcelona, Catalonia. She loved the writer Elisabeth Mulder, but Mart√≠nez Sagi's family separated them. Together with Josefina Carabias, Mart√≠nez Sagi was a key journalist of the Republic. She interviewed various people, including beggars, prostitutes, and Catalan politicians. Mart√≠nez Sagi's articles focused especially on women's suffrage, a controversial issue at the time. She joined Durruti Column as a journalist during the war. In addition to his journalistic work, she also published several books of poetry. Her desperate and distressed style was similar to that of the Latin American poets Juana de Ibarbourou, Alfonsina Storni, and Gabriela Mistral. After her first book of poetry, Caminos, was published in 1930, Alberto Ins√∫a compared Mart√≠nez Sagi to Rosal√≠a de Castro. As a feminist, Mart√≠nez Sagi espoused ideas which came from France. She founded the first club of women workers of Barcelona, which worked to improve literacy among women. A sports enthusiast, Martinez Sagi was a national champion in javelin. Her brother, Armand Mart√≠nez Sagi (1919‚Äì1923), and cousin, Emilio Sagi Li√±√°n, played for FC Barcelona, and in 1934, she became a Director of FC Barcelona, the first woman to do so in Spanish football's history. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Mart√≠nez Sagi was exiled to France, where she participated in the Resistance. In 1950, she moved to the US, and, having a degree in French Language and Literature, she was able to teach at the University of Illinois. She returned to Spain in 1975, after the death of Francisco Franco, retiring to private life.

Even after oscillating between the realms of legality and illegality, street vending in Mexico and even in other parts of the world, is not the exception but rather has been a norm when it comes to commercial activities. In 2003, it was estimated that there were 199,328 street vendors in Mexico City. History Prior to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, commercial activity primarily took place in the tianguis or marketplaces. In New Spain, outside of the controlled mercado or market on the Z√≥calo and other squares, street vendors emerged, then called buhoneros. Efforts to control street vendors date back to at least 1541, when the city government prohibited itinerant vendors. The 1970s and 1980s saw a huge growth in the number of vendors. In 1993, the first of several major efforts (each only partially successful) to reduce street vending in the Historic Center of Mexico City began, with the removal of about 10,000 vendors from the streets and construction of markets (plazas comerciales) to re- accommodate them, as well as subject them to tax codes, health regulations and otherwise pay the full \\"costs of formality.\\"Los Angeles Times, \\"Changing Lifestyles : Wanted: Place to Relocate 10,000 Street Vendors\\", October 19, 1993 In 1998 guidelines attempting to formalize and bring order to the sector were published as the Programa de Reordenamiento del Comercio en Via Publica, or Program for the Reordering of Trade in the Public Streets, however street vending continued to grow.Redes sociales y comercio en v√≠a p√∫blica en la Ciudad de M√©xico, Norma G√≥mez M√©ndez Efforts to remove the vendors eventually failed as vendors returned to the streets. During the 1990s and 2000s street vendors have paid union leaders \\"dues\\" in exchange for the right to occupy a piece of sidewalk without city permission, an illegal act. The unions in turn, bribed and lobbied city officials to allow the vendors to stay.Los Angeles Times, \\"Vendor-free zone in Mexico City center\\", October 13, 2007 Finally, in October 2007 the streets of the Historic Center were cleared of vendors with much success, which was considered a victory for mayor Marcelo Ebrard. However, toreros (literally \\"bullfighters\\") remain active in the area ‚Äî people who sell merchandise from a tarp on the ground which converts to a bag that they can carry the merchandise in and carry it away when police show up to clear illegal street vendors.\\"‚ÄúToreros‚Äù, un mal del Centro Hist√≥rico\\", M√°s por M√°s\\", February 18, 2013 Types of street vendors and products Street vendors in a variety of formats, with items sold from: *baskets, particularly sandwiches, tacos, *pushcarts, particularly prepared fruit and coconut water *the backs of trucks (lorries), particularly fruit and toilet paper *a tarp or cloth laid on the ground *stalls Vendors selling from stalls may be organized into a number of formats: * tianguis and mobile markets (mercados sobre ruedas): These markets take place in a designated place on certain days of the week, with a fixed schedule and supervised by a city inspector for compliance with weights and measurements. These markets are part of the strategy for the supply and distribution of food staples to the city. * Concentrations: areas of vendors selling from stalls, not officially organized, specializing in certain types of products, such as imported illegal merchandise or fayuca, especially electronics, in Tepito, or auto parts, tools, clothing, etc. Although in many cases those selling from stalls are not truly itinerant (ambulante, in Spanish) - they are still referred to as ambulantes. Concentrations of stalls are also found at metro station entrances, near hospital entrances etc. * Bazaars (plazas comerciales), where vendors of a certain \\"theme\\" (stationery) are housed; originally these were organized to accommodate vendors formerly selling on the street *Individual or small groups of stalls on any given city sidewalk Numbers A 2013 study revealed just in the Historic Center of Mexico City: *25,000 vendors *150 blocks of the Historic Center where informal vendors were present *70% of the toreros coming from the State of Mexico *60 organizations controlling the vendors A 2003 INEGI study showed 199,328 street vendors in Mexico City proper (Mexican Federal District). A study in the mid-1990s had estimated the number of street vendors as follows: *Total full-time street vendors: 185,600. This number excludes those who occasionally sell in the street or who add to the numbers during peak commercial seasons, and the study estimated that if included they would probably add at least 50 per cent to the figure. *Concentrations: 1,500 stalls on the street or sidewalks (not counting 10,500 stalls in empty lots) Rotating Markets: 38,000 stalls *Ambulatory: 67,248 stalls *Metro stations: 5,000 stalls *Street corners/neighborhoods: 10,000 *Total stalls: 121,738. ‚Äì Source: John C .

It provides one of two known approaches to solving the bipartite realization problem, i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for two finite sequences of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a labeled simple bipartite graph; a sequence obeying these conditions is called \\"bigraphic\\". It is an analog of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem for simple graphs. The theorem was published in 1957 by H. J. Ryser and also by David Gale. Statement A pair of sequences of nonnegative integers (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n) and (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n) with a_1\\\\geq\\\\cdots\\\\geq a_n is bigraphic if and only if \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i and the following inequality holds for k such that 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n: : \\\\sum^k_{i=1} a_i\\\\leq \\\\sum^n_{i=1} \\\\min(b_i,k). Remark Sometimes this theorem is stated with the additional constraint b_1\\\\geq\\\\cdots\\\\geq b_n. This condition is not necessary, because the labels of vertices of one partite set in a bipartite graph can be switched arbitrarily. In 1962 Ford and Fulkerson gave a different but equivalent formulation for the theorem. Other notations The theorem can also be stated in terms of zero-one matrices. The connection can be seen if one realizes that each bipartite graph has a biadjacency matrix where the column sums and row sums correspond to (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n) and (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n). Each sequence can also be considered as a partition of the same number m=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i. It turns out that partition (a^*_1,\\\\ldots,a^*_n) where a^*_k:=|\\\\\\\\{b_i|b_i \\\\geq k\\\\\\\\}is the conjugate partition of (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n). The conjugate partition can be determined by a Ferrers diagram. Moreover, there is a connection to the relation majorization. Consider sequences (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n), (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n) and (a^*_1,\\\\ldots,a^*_n) as n-dimensional vectors a, b and a^*. Since \\\\sum_{i=1}^k a^*_i =\\\\sum^n_{i=1} \\\\min(b_i,k) , the theorem above states that a pair of nonnegative integer sequences a and b with nonincreasing a is bigraphic if and only if the conjugate partition a^* of b majorizes a. A third formulation is in terms of degree sequences of simple directed graphs with at most one loop per vertex. In this case the matrix is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of such a directed graph. When are pairs of nonnegative integers ((a_1,b_1),...,(a_n,b_n)) the indegree-outdegree pairs of a labeled directed graph with at most one loop per vertex? The theorem can easily be adapted to this formulation, because there does not exist a special order of b. Proofs The proof is composed of two parts: the necessity of the condition and its sufficiency. We outline the proof of both parts in the language of matrices. To see that the condition in the theorem is necessary, consider the adjacency matrix of a bigraphic realization with row sums (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n) and column sums (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n), and shift all ones in the matrix to the left. The row sums remain, while the column sums are now a^*. The operation of shifting all ones to the left increases a partition in majorization order, and so a^* majorizes a. The original proof of sufficiency of the condition was rather complicated. gave a simple algorithmic proof. The idea is to start with the Ferrers diagram of b and shift ones to the right until the column sums are a. The algorithm runs in at most n steps, in each of which a single one entry is moved to the right. Stronger version Berger proved that it suffices to consider those kth inequalities such that 1 \\\\leq k < n with a_k > a_{k+1} and the equality for k = n. Generalization A pair of finite sequences of nonnegative integers a and b with nonincreasing a is bigraphic if and only if \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i and there exists a sequence c such that the pair c,b is bigraphic and c majorizes a . Moreover, in is also proved that pair a and b has more bigraphic realizations than pair c and b. This yields to the result that regular sequences have for fixed numbers of vertices and edges the largest number of bigraphic realizations, if n divides m. They are the contrary sequences of threshold sequences with only one unique bigraphic realization, which is known as threshold graph. Minconvex sequences generalize this concept if n does not divide m. Characterizations for similar problems Similar theorems describe the degree sequences of simple graphs and simple directed graphs. The first problem is characterized by the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem. The latter case is characterized by the Fulkerson‚ÄìChen‚ÄìAnstee theorem. Notes References    *. *.

The first golf club formed in Queensland was the North Queensland Golf Club which was established on 2 August 1893 at Kissing Point in North Ward, Townsville, but was renamed the Townsville Golf Club in 1894. The next were Toowoomba Golf Club in August 1896 and a few months later Brisbane Golf Club in November 1896. Other clubs quickly followed: Ipswich in 1897; Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Victoria Park (in Brisbane) in 1898, and Gladstone in 1899. The Queensland Golf Union was formed in 1914. Golf Queensland was established in July 2007 from the merger of Queensland Golf Union and Women's Golf Queensland.

Its business model boasts a strong environmental focus. Currently, it is the only certified carbon neutral health fund in Australia.Carbon Reduction Institute: http://www.noco2.com.au/ History HIF (Health Insurance Fund of Australia) began in 1954 as the Western Australian Government Railways Employees‚Äô Hospital and Medical Fund. Within a few months this name was changed to the Government Employees‚Äô Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund Incorporated. In 1978, to comply with the Associations Incorporations Act 1895 (WA), HIF became the Health Insurance Fund of WA. In 2010, the fund changed its name to Health Insurance Fund of Australia Limited to reflect its nationally expanding client base. Also in 2010, data published by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) revealed HIF to be the fastest growing not-for- profit Australian health fund for that financial year. Legal structure alterations =Legal structure prior to 2010= In 2008, the Federal Government passed the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 (Cth) (PHILA Act); seeking to amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (Cth). This legislation governs the operation of all private health insurers. The PHILA Act required all insurers to qualify as a ‚Äòcompany‚Äô as stipulated by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). As a result of this, on 1 December 2009, the Western Australian Government passed legislation facilitating the transfer of HIF's status from an incorporated association under the Associations Incorporations Act 1987 (WA) to an Australian public company. =Legal structure today= Today HIF is an Australian public company limited by guarantee and governed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). HIF is registered with the federal regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) as an open access, not for profit, private, health insurer.Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (Cth): http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/phia2007248/ Private health insurance in Australia is heavily regulated.

It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited regardless of whether the vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. Thus, the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed. Heartbleed is registered in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database as . The federal Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre issued a security bulletin advising system administrators about the bug. A fixed version of OpenSSL was released on 7 April 2014, on the same day Heartbleed was publicly disclosed. , 1.5% of the 800,000 most popular TLS-enabled websites were still vulnerable to Heartbleed. , 309,197 public web servers remained vulnerable. , according to a report from Shodan, nearly 180,000 internet-connected devices were still vulnerable. , the number had dropped to 144,000, according to a search on shodan.io for \\"vuln:cve-2014-0160\\". , Shodan reported that 91,063 devices were vulnerable. The U.S. was first with 21,258 (23%), the top 10 countries had 56,537 (62%), and the remaining countries had 34,526 (38%). The report also breaks the devices down by 10 other categories such as organization (the top 3 were wireless companies), product (Apache httpd, nginx), or service (https, 81%). TLS implementations other than OpenSSL, such as GnuTLS, Mozilla's Network Security Services, and the Windows platform implementation of TLS, were not affected because the defect existed in the OpenSSL's implementation of TLS rather than in the protocol itself.  History  The Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocols was proposed as a standard in February 2012 by . It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule M√ºnster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put the result of his work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on 31 December 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on 14 March 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable. = Discovery = According to Mark J. Cox of OpenSSL, Neel Mehta of Google's security team privately reported Heartbleed to the OpenSSL team on 1 April 2014 11:09 UTC. The bug was named by an engineer at Synopsys Software Integrity Group (formerly Codenomicon), a Finnish cyber security company that also created the bleeding heart logo and launched the domain to explain the bug to the public. While Google's security team reported Heartbleed to OpenSSL first, both Google and Codenomicon discovered it independently at approximately the same time. Codenomicon reports 3 April 2014 as their date of discovery and their date of notification of NCSC-FI for vulnerability coordination. At the time of disclosure, some 17% (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers certified by trusted authorities were believed to be vulnerable to the attack, allowing theft of the servers' private keys and users' session cookies and passwords. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Ars Technica, and Bruce Schneier all deemed the Heartbleed bug \\"catastrophic\\". Forbes cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote: A British Cabinet spokesman recommended that: On the day of disclosure, the Tor Project advised: The Sydney Morning Herald published a timeline of the discovery on 15 April 2014, showing that some organizations had been able to patch the bug before its public disclosure. In some cases, it is not clear how they found out. = Bugfix and deployment = Bodo M√∂ller and Adam Langley of Google prepared the fix for Heartbleed. The resulting patch was added to Red Hat's issue tracker on 21 March 2014. Stephen N. Henson applied the fix to OpenSSL's version control system on 7 April. The first fixed version, 1.0.1g, was released on the same day. , 309,197 public web servers remained vulnerable. , according to a report from Shodan, nearly 180,000 internet-connected devices were still vulnerable. The number had dropped to 144,000 , according to a search on shodan.io for \\"vuln:cve-2014-0160\\". = Certificate renewal and revocation = According to Netcraft, about 30,000 of the 500,000+ X.509 certificates which could have been compromised due to Heartbleed had been reissued by 11 April 2014, although fewer had been revoked. By 9 May 2014, only 43% of affected web sites had reissued their security certificates. In addition, 7% of the reissued security certificates used the potentially compromised keys. Netcraft stated: eWeek said, \\"[Heartbleed is] likely to remain a risk for months, if not years, to come.\\" = Exploitation = The Canada Revenue Agency reported a theft of Social Insurance Numbers belonging to 900 taxpayers, and said that they were accessed through an exploit of the bug during a 6-hour period on 8 April 2014. Some of the details are in the video linked from the page. After the discovery of the attack, the agency shut down its website and extended the taxpayer filing deadline from 30 April to 5 May. The agency said it would provide credit protection services at no cost to anyone affected. On 16 April, the RCMP announced they had charged a computer science student in relation to the theft with unauthorized use of a computer and mischief in relation to data. The UK parenting site Mumsnet had several user accounts hijacked, and its CEO was impersonated. The site later published an explanation of the incident saying it was due to Heartbleed and the technical staff patched it promptly. Anti-malware researchers also exploited Heartbleed to their own advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on 12 April 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on 15 April 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that because it was a fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet. In August 2014, it was made public that the Heartbleed vulnerability enabled hackers to steal security keys from Community Health Systems, the second-biggest for-profit U.S. hospital chain in the United States, compromising the confidentiality of 4.5 million patient records. The breach happened a week after Heartbleed was first made public.  Possible prior knowledge and exploitation  Many major web sites patched the bug or disabled the Heartbeat Extension within days of its announcement, but it is unclear whether potential attackers were aware of it earlier and to what extent it was exploited. Based on examinations of audit logs by researchers, it has been reported that some attackers may have exploited the flaw for at least five months before discovery and announcement. Errata Security pointed out that a widely used non-malicious program called Masscan, introduced six months before Heartbleed's disclosure, abruptly terminates the connection in the middle of handshaking in the same way as Heartbleed, generating the same server log messages, adding \\"Two new things producing the same error messages might seem like the two are correlated, but of course, they aren't.\\" According to Bloomberg News, two unnamed insider sources informed it that the United States' National Security Agency had been aware of the flaw since shortly after its appearance butinstead of reporting itkept it secret among other unreported zero-day vulnerabilities in order to exploit it for the NSA's own purposes. The NSA has denied this claim, as has Richard A. Clarke, a member of the National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies that reviewed the United States' electronic surveillance policy; he told Reuters on 11 April 2014 that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed. The allegation prompted the American government to make, for the first time, a public statement on its zero-day vulnerabilities policy, accepting the recommendation of the review group's 2013 report that had asserted \\"in almost all instances, for widely used code, it is in the national interest to eliminate software vulnerabilities rather than to use them for US intelligence collection\\", and saying that the decision to withhold should move from the NSA to the White House.  Behavior  A depiction of Heartbleed. The RFC 6520 Heartbeat Extension tests TLS/DTLS secure communication links by allowing a computer at one end of a connection to send a Heartbeat Request message, consisting of a payload, typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same payload back to the sender. The affected versions of OpenSSL allocate a memory buffer for the message to be returned based on the length field in the requesting message, without regard to the actual size of that message's payload. Because of this failure to do proper bounds checking, the message returned consists of the payload, possibly followed by whatever else happened to be in the allocated memory buffer. Heartbleed is therefore exploited by sending a malformed heartbeat request with a small payload and large length field to the vulnerable party (usually a server) in order to elicit the victim's response, permitting attackers to read up to 64 kilobytes of the victim's memory that was likely to have been used previously by OpenSSL. Where a Heartbeat Request might ask a party to \\"send back the four-letter word 'bird'\\", resulting in a response of \\"bird\\", a \\"Heartbleed Request\\" (a malicious heartbeat request) of \\"send back the 500-letter word 'bird'\\" would cause the victim to return \\"bird\\" followed by whatever 496 subsequent characters the victim happened to have in active memory. Attackers in this way could receive sensitive data, compromising the confidentiality of the victim's communications. Although an attacker has some control over the disclosed memory block's size, it has no control over its location, and therefore cannot choose what content is revealed. = Affected OpenSSL installations = The affected versions of OpenSSL are OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive). Subsequent versions (1.0.1g and later) and previous versions (1.0.0 branch and older) are not vulnerable. Installations of the affected versions are vulnerable unless OpenSSL was compiled with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS.  Vulnerable program and function  The vulnerable program source files are t1_lib.c and d1_both.c and the vulnerable functions are tls1_process_heartbeat() and dtls1_process_heartbeat(). = Patch = The problem can be fixed by ignoring Heartbeat Request messages that ask for more data than their payload need. Version 1.0.1g of OpenSSL adds some bounds checks to prevent the buffer over-read. For example, the following test was introduced to determine whether a heartbeat request would trigger Heartbleed; it silently discards malicious requests. if (1 + 2 + payload + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length) return 0; /* silently discard per RFC 6520 sec. 4 */ The OpenSSL version control system contains a complete list of changes.  Impact  The data obtained by a Heartbleed attack may include unencrypted exchanges between TLS parties likely to be confidential, including any form post data in users' requests. Moreover, the confidential data exposed could include authentication secrets such as session cookies and passwords, which might allow attackers to impersonate a user of the service. An attack may also reveal private keys of compromised parties, which would enable attackers to decrypt communications (future or past stored traffic captured via passive eavesdropping, unless perfect forward secrecy is used, in which case only future traffic can be decrypted if intercepted via man-in-the-middle attacks). An attacker having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner after the victim has patched Heartbleed, as long as the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems. A survey of American adults conducted in April 2014 showed that 60 percent had heard about Heartbleed. Among those using the Internet, 39 percent had protected their online accounts, for example by changing passwords or canceling accounts; 29 percent believed their personal information was put at risk because of the Heartbleed bug; and 6 percent believed their personal information had been stolen. = Client-side vulnerability = Although the bug received more attention due to the threat it represents for servers, TLS clients using affected OpenSSL instances are also vulnerable. In what The Guardian therefore dubbed Reverse Heartbleed, malicious servers are able to exploit Heartbleed to read data from a vulnerable client's memory. Security researcher Steve Gibson said of Heartbleed that: The stolen data could contain usernames and passwords. Reverse Heartbleed affected millions of application instances. Some of the vulnerable applications are listed in the \\"Software applications\\" section below. = Specific systems affected = Cisco Systems has identified 78 of its products as vulnerable, including IP phone systems and telepresence (video conferencing) systems.  Websites and other online services  An analysis posted on GitHub of the most visited websites on 8 April 2014 revealed vulnerabilities in sites including Yahoo!, Imgur, Stack Overflow, Slate, and DuckDuckGo. The following sites have services affected or made announcements recommending that users update passwords in response to the bug: * Akamai Technologies * Amazon Web Services * Ars Technica * Bitbucket * BrandVerity * Freenode * GitHub * IFTTT * Internet Archive * Mojang * Mumsnet * PeerJ * Pinterest * Prezi * Reddit * Something Awful * SoundCloud * SourceForge * SparkFun * Stripe * Tumblr * All Wikimedia Foundation wikis (including Wikipedia in all languages) * Wunderlist The Canadian federal government temporarily shut online services of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and several government departments over Heartbleed bug security concerns. Before the CRA online services were shut down, a hacker obtained approximately 900 social insurance numbers. Another Canadian Government agency, Statistics Canada, had its servers compromised due to the bug and also temporarily took its services offline. Platform maintainers like the Wikimedia Foundation advised their users to change passwords. The servers of LastPass were vulnerable, but due to additional encryption and forward secrecy, potential attacks were not able to exploit this bug. However, LastPass recommended that its users change passwords for vulnerable websites. The Tor Project recommended that Tor relay operators and hidden service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use two sets of keys and that Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken off-line as a precautionary measure. Game-related services including Steam, Minecraft, Wargaming, League of Legends, GOG.com, Origin, Sony Online Entertainment, Humble Bundle, and Path of Exile were affected and subsequently fixed.  Software applications  Vulnerable software applications include: * Several Hewlett-Packard server applications, such as HP System Management Homepage (SMH) for Linux and Windows. * Some versions of FileMaker 13 * LibreOffice 4.2.0 to 4.2.2 (fixed in 4.2.3) * LogMeIn claimed to have \\"updated many products and parts of our services that rely on OpenSSL\\". * Multiple McAfee products, in particular some versions of software providing anti-viral coverage for Microsoft Exchange, software firewalls, and McAfee Email and Web Gateways * MySQL Workbench 6.1.4 and earlier * Oracle MySQL Connector/C 6.1.0-6.1.3 and Connector/ODBC 5.1.13, 5.2.5-5.2.6, 5.3.2 * Oracle Big Data Appliance (includes Oracle Linux 6) * Primavera P6 Professional Project Management (includes Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management) * WinSCP (FTP client for Windows) 5.5.2 and some earlier versions (only vulnerable with FTP over TLS/SSL, fixed in 5.5.3) * Multiple VMware products, including VMware ESXi 5.5, VMware Player 6.0, VMware Workstation 10 and the series of Horizon products, emulators and cloud computing suites Several other Oracle Corporation applications were affected.  Operating systems/firmware  Several GNU/Linux distributions were affected, including Debian (and derivatives such as Linux Mint and Ubuntu) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and derivatives such as CentOS, Oracle Linux 6 and Amazon Linux), as well as the following operating systems and firmware implementations: * Android 4.1.1, used in various portable devices. Chris Smith writes in Boy Genius Report that just this one version of Android is affected but that it is a popular version of Android (Chitika claim 4.1.1 is on 50 million devices; Google describe it as less than 10% of activated Android devices). Other Android versions are not vulnerable as they either have heartbeats disabled or use an unaffected version of OpenSSL. * Firmware for some AirPort base stations * Firmware for some Cisco Systems routers * Firmware for some Juniper Networks routers * pfSense 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 (fixed in 2.1.2) * DD-WRT versions between and including 19163 and 23881 (fixed in 23882) * Western Digital My Cloud product family firmware = Vulnerability testing services = Several services have been made available to test whether Heartbleed affects a given site. However, many services have been claimed to be ineffective for detecting the bug. The available tools include: * Tripwire SecureScan * AppCheck ‚Äì static binary scan and fuzzing, from Synopsys Software Integrity Group (formerly Codenomicon) * Arbor Network's Pravail Security Analytics * Norton Safeweb Heartbleed Check Tool * Heartbleed testing tool by a European IT security company * Heartbleed test by Italian cryptographer Filippo Valsorda * Heartbleed Vulnerability Test by Cyberoam * Critical Watch Free Online Heartbleed Tester * Metasploit Heartbleed scanner module * Heartbleed Server Scanner by Rehmann * Lookout Mobile Security Heartbleed Detector, an app for Android devices that determines the OpenSSL version of the device and indicates whether the vulnerable heartbeat is enabled * Heartbleed checker hosted by LastPass * Online network range scanner for Heartbleed vulnerability by Pentest-Tools.com * Official Red Hat offline scanner written in the Python language * Qualys SSL Labs' SSL Server Test which not only looks for the Heartbleed bug, but can also find other SSL/TLS implementation errors. * Browser extensions, such as Chromebleed and FoxBleed * SSL Diagnos * CrowdStrike Heartbleed Scanner ‚Äì Scans routers, printers and other devices connected inside a network including intranet web sites. * Netcraft Site Report ‚Äì indicates whether a website's confidentiality could be jeopardized due to a past exploitation of Heartbleed by checking data from Netcraft's SSL Survey to determine whether a site offered the heartbeat TLS Extension prior to the Heartbleed disclosure. The Netcraft Extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Opera also perform this check, whilst looking for potentially compromised certificates. Other security tools have added support for finding this bug. For example, Tenable Network Security wrote a plugin for its Nessus vulnerability scanner that can scan for this fault. The Nmap security scanner includes a Heartbleed detection script from version 6.45. Sourcefire has released Snort rules to detect Heartbleed attack traffic and possible Heartbleed response traffic. Open source packet analysis software such as Wireshark and tcpdump can identify Heartbleed packets using specific BPF packet filters that can be used on stored packet captures or live traffic.  Remediation  Vulnerability to Heartbleed is resolved by updating OpenSSL to a patched version (1.0.1g or later). OpenSSL can be used either as a standalone program, a dynamic shared object, or a statically-linked library; therefore, the updating process can require restarting processes loaded with a vulnerable version of OpenSSL as well as re-linking programs and libraries that linked it statically. In practice this means updating packages that link OpenSSL statically, and restarting running programs to remove the in-memory copy of the old, vulnerable OpenSSL code. After the vulnerability is patched, server administrators must address the potential breach of confidentiality. Because Heartbleed allowed attackers to disclose private keys, they must be treated as compromised; keypairs must be regenerated, and certificates that use them must be reissued; the old certificates must be revoked. Heartbleed also had the potential to allow disclosure of other in-memory secrets; therefore, other authentication material (such as passwords) should also be regenerated. It is rarely possible to confirm that a system which was affected has not been compromised, or to determine whether a specific piece of information was leaked. Since it is difficult or impossible to determine when a credential might have been compromised and how it might have been used by an attacker, certain systems may warrant additional remediation work even after patching the vulnerability and replacing credentials. For example, signatures made by keys that were in use with a vulnerable OpenSSL version might well have been made by an attacker; this raises the possibility integrity has been violated, and opens signatures to repudiation. Validation of signatures and the legitimacy of other authentications made with a potentially compromised key (such as client certificate use) must be done with regard to the specific system involved. = Browser security certificate revocation awareness = Since Heartbleed threatened the privacy of private keys, users of a website which was compromised could continue to suffer from Heartbleed's effects until their browser is made aware of the certificate revocation or the compromised certificate expires. For this reason, remediation also depends on users making use of browsers that have up-to-date certificate revocation lists (or OCSP support) and honour certificate revocations.  Root causes, possible lessons, and reactions  Although evaluating the total cost of Heartbleed is difficult, eWEEK estimated US$500 million as a starting point. David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent the next Heartbleed analyzes why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques which could have led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could have prevented Heartbleed is a test suite thoroughly performing robustness testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite could serve as a base for all TLS implementations. According to an article on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed revealed a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not be blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions the use of the C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis. On the same aspect, Theo de Raadt, founder and leader of the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects, has criticized the OpenSSL developers for writing their own memory management routines and thereby, he claims, circumventing OpenBSD C standard library exploit countermeasures, saying \\"OpenSSL is not developed by a responsible team.\\" Following Heartbleed's disclosure, members of the OpenBSD project forked OpenSSL into LibreSSL. The author of the change which introduced Heartbleed, Robin Seggelmann, stated that he missed validating a variable containing a length and denied any intention to submit a flawed implementation. Following Heartbleed's disclosure, Seggelmann suggested focusing on the second aspect, stating that OpenSSL is not reviewed by enough people. Although Seggelmann's work was reviewed by an OpenSSL core developer, the review was also intended to verify functional improvements, a situation making vulnerabilities much easier to miss. OpenSSL core developer Ben Laurie claimed that a security audit of OpenSSL would have caught Heartbleed. Software engineer John Walsh commented: The OpenSSL foundation's president, Steve Marquess, said \\"The mystery is not that a few overworked volunteers missed this bug; the mystery is why it hasn't happened more often.\\" David A. Wheeler described audits as an excellent way to find vulnerabilities in typical cases, but noted that \\"OpenSSL uses unnecessarily complex structures, which makes it harder to both humans and machines to review.\\" He wrote: > There should be a continuous effort to simplify the code, because otherwise > just adding capabilities will slowly increase the software complexity. The > code should be refactored over time to make it simple and clear, not just > constantly add new features. The goal should be code that is ‚Äúobviously > right‚Äù, as opposed to code that is so complicated that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see any > problems‚Äù. LibreSSL made a big code cleanup, removing more than 90,000 lines of C code just in its first week. According to security researcher Dan Kaminsky, Heartbleed is sign of an economic problem which needs to be fixed. Seeing the time taken to catch this simple error in a simple feature from a \\"critical\\" dependency, Kaminsky fears numerous future vulnerabilities if nothing is done. When Heartbleed was discovered, OpenSSL was maintained by a handful of volunteers, only one of whom worked full-time. Yearly donations to the OpenSSL project were about US$2,000. The Heartbleed website from Codenomicon advised money donations to the OpenSSL project. After learning about donations for the 2 or 3 days following Heartbleed's disclosure totaling US$841, Kaminsky commented \\"We are building the most important technologies for the global economy on shockingly underfunded infrastructure.\\" Core developer Ben Laurie has qualified the project as \\"completely unfunded\\". Although the OpenSSL Software Foundation has no bug bounty program, the Internet Bug Bounty initiative awarded US$15,000 to Google's Neel Mehta, who discovered Heartbleed, for his responsible disclosure. Paul Chiusano suggested Heartbleed may have resulted from failed software economics. The industry's collective response to the crisis was the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a multimillion- dollar project announced by the Linux Foundation on 24 April 2014 to provide funds to critical elements of the global information infrastructure. The initiative intends to allow lead developers to work full-time on their projects and to pay for security audits, hardware and software infrastructure, travel, and other expenses. OpenSSL is a candidate to become the first recipient of the initiative's funding. After the discovery Google established Project Zero which is tasked with finding zero-day vulnerabilities to help secure the Web and society.

The Wallaby Plateau covers approximately and is in water depths of to greater than . In the west, the Wallaby Plateau is separated from the Zenith Plateau by a wide, north to northeast-trending bathymetric trough.British Oceanographic Data Centre, 2003, GEBCO Digital Atlas. British Oceanographic Data Centre, National Environment Research Council, United Kingdom.Geoscience Australia, 2012, Wallaby Plateau. Offshore Southwest Australia. Geoscience Australia, Canberra, Australia. Wallaby Plateau is the name used by the Australian geologists and government for this undersea plateau. This name was first used in a Hartog AGSO bathymetric map and formally recognized in a peer-reviewed paper by Symonds and Cameron in 1977.Symonds, P.A., and P. J. Cameron, 1977, The structure and stratigraphy of the Carnarvon Terrace and Wallaby Plateau. The APEA Journal. vol. 17, pp. 30‚Äì41. In contrast, the internationally recognized name for it is Cuvier Plateau. Cuvier is a historical name that is presumably derived from the adjacent Cape Cuvier. Cape Cuvier was named for Georges Cuvier, zoologist and statesman, by a French expedition led by Baudin in 1800 ‚Äì 1803.British Oceanographic Data Centre, 2010, IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, August 2010 version. British Oceanographic Data Centre, National Environment Research Council, United Kingdom. The Wallaby Plateau lies inside the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone. The Wallaby Plateau largely lies within the Australia's extended continental shelf. It apparently consists of attenuated continental crust which is buried beneath a thick sequence of volcanic rocks that are blanketed by marine sediments.Nelson, G., M. Hughes, R. Przeslawski, S. Nichol, B. Lewis, and K. Rawsthorn, 2009, Revealing the Wallaby Plateau. AusGeo News. no. 94, pp. 1-4. Origins The origins of the Wallaby Plateau date back 130 million years ago during the break up of the Australian and Greater India plates.Geoscience Australia With the help of seismic reflection and geodynamic reconstruction data, evidence was published to support the origin of the area back to the development of the lithospheric-scale Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone during the breakup of the two continental plates. Additionally, even earlier studies of the region attributed the formation of this area to large-scale volcanic activity on the oceanic crust. Studies A recent study of the plateau conducted in 2008-2009 by Geoscience Australia surveyed 65,000 square kilometers of the area to gain a broader geologic understanding. A multibeam swath bathymetry along with 8000 line kilometers of high-resolution gravity, magnetic and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements were collected along with several rock and sediment samples. A total of eleven rock dredges, three sediment grabs, four box cores, one sea floor trawl, eight camera and temperature tows, conductivity (salinity) and depth profiles through the water column. Data from this survey revealed and reaffirmed early studies that volcanic activity was a major factor in the early formations of this vast plateau. Along with three large volcano complexes, and two other small and steeper cone-shaped complexes, several valleys, scarps, and ridges were discovered as well as a new seafloor. Additionally, on the northeast of the plateau, what researchers believe are volcanic hills, were discovered from the bathymetry data from the survey. Survey Samples A total of ten samples of sedimentary rocks, 14 volcanic rock samples, and an additional seven samples with mineral development were collected with the help of various geologic tools. Rock samples collected during the survey were predominantly igneous and also siliceous in nature, thus supporting the notion once more of the volcanic origins of the Wallaby Plateau. Terrigenous clastic rocks were also recovered providing primitive evidence of sediment deposits when the plateau was at or above sea level. From the sediment rock samples collected researchers determined that a poorly sorted ‚Äúooze‚Äù comprises a large part of the seafloor sediments on the Plateau.

The congregation was founded in 1824-5 as the Methodist Episcopal Church of Athens. Its first meeting house was a structure of hewn logs built by slaves. It stood at the southwest corner of West Washington and Church Streets in Athens. It was eventually replaced by a brick building. When the Civil War resulted in a split within the Methodist Episcopal denomination, the congregation affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. After the 1939 merger between that denomination and the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church, the church became known as Trinity Methodist Church. It became a United Methodist church in 1968, when the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church combined to form that denomination. The present church building was completed in 1910 at a cost of $32,449.28; its education wing was added in 1926. The Gothic Revival architectural design of the 1910 church was provided by Badgley and Nicklas, a Cleveland, Ohio, architecture firm. The building design features two towers, stained glass windows with stone tracery, an octagonal dome ceiling, and eight columns to represent the eight people who survived Noah's flood. It has an Akron floor plan, which allows the sanctuary to be expanded to accommodate large events. In 2009, the church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was there that she was discovered by Bora Spu≈æiƒá Kvaka, with whose daughter she went to school. She later completed a course in Aran≈æerskoj school at the National University \\"Bozidar Ad≈æija\\", and then the Faculty of Economics and studied law. She was married four times. Her best most known husbands are the accordionists Ljuba Ke≈°elj and Miroljub Aranƒëeloviƒá Kemi≈° with whom she has been married since 1985. She has four children (three daughters and a son), and became a grandmother in 2013. Brunclik was part of the leadership of the Yugoslav Left party and was a personal friend of both Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his wife Mira Markoviƒá. Because of this, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in 2000, she experienced media isolation and blockade, as well as a variety of other inconveniences incited by supporters of the new regime.  Career  Zorica was introduced to fame by Bora Spu≈æiƒá Kvaka, a well known folk singer in the former Yugoslavia . After 5 years of singing in pubs and restaurants, performing at the Hotel \\"Danube\\" in Pozarevac she meets the then unknown singer and composer Novica Urosevic with whom she builds a musical career . He had performed with the orchestra of Tihomir Paunoviƒáa Tike who was at that time looking for new singers so this was Zorica's opportunity to record a song for Radio Television Belgrade. The first song was recorded for PGP Radio Television Belgrade 20 January 1975 and it was a single with the title track, \\" Ne daj da nas rastave\\" (Don't let them break us apart). This song was a big success and the single was issued with a circulation of 300 000 copies. After that success Zorica's songs were often the most listened to on radio stations. She has worked with the orchestra of Branimir Djokic, she later continued collaboration with accordionist Ljuba Ke≈°elj who was her former husband, and in 1985 she marries accordion player and arranger Miroljub Aranƒëeloviƒá Kemi≈°, after which she achieved even greater success. She has recorded for PGP RTB (later PGP RTS) in Belgrade, and Diskoton in Sarajevo, and Diskos in Aleksandrovac. She achieved artistic collaborations with many of her colleagues by recording duets or being a guest at their concerts . After 5 October revolution she took a break from singing for two years, and then went on to record for the production companys Gold, Grand and VIP . From her early career an interesting fact is that in the restaurants and hotels, among others, she has performed with the Orchestra of the Karic Brothers –±—Ä–∞—õ–µ –ö–∞—Ä–∏—õ.

Precise ocean floor depth data from bathymetric surveys, which used modern acoustic echosounders, across this undersea plateau are lacking. Transects across it by older, less precise singlebeam echosounder are few and insufficient to provide bathymetric data of significant detail. The bulk of the mapping is based upon coarse interpretation of satellite altimetry data in which the ocean floor bathymetry is inferred from measured variations in the elevation of the overlying sea surface.Sandwel, D.

It was initially known as the Zenith Seamount as shown in the 1933 DMA Chart 5446 and the May 1975 Australian INT 708 chart. The Zenith Plateau is incorrectly designated as the Wallaby Plateau by a few official charts, some popular maps, American Association of Petroleum Geologists' maps, and the ACUF Gazetter. This confusion likely is the result of maps by Heezen and TharpHeezen, B.C. and M. Tharp, 1965, Physiographic Diagram of the Indian Ocean (with descriptive sheet).

AGSO Journal of Australian Geology & Geophysics, 15(11):137-156. Geology Because the Zenith Plateau has not been studied in any detail, its internal structure and origin has largely been a matter of speculation and indirect inference from magnetic and satellite gravity studies and research involving adjacent bathymetric highs. It is generally inferred to be of the same geologic structure and origin as the adjacent and better studied Quokka Rise. Initially, the Zenith Plateau, along with the adjacent Wallaby Plateau, was thought to be part of a short-lived hotspot. As the result of detailed studies of the Wallaby Plateau, this hypothesis has been largely abandoned. Later, it was proposed that the Zenith Plateau, like the adjacent Wallaby Plateau, consists of a continental fragment of highly attenuated, stretched, and faulted continental crust that has been extensively intruded by magmatic rocks and deeply buried by volcanic rocks during the initial breakup of East Gondwana.Planke, S., P. A. Symonds, and C. Berndt, 2002, Volcanic rifted margin structure and development: A comparison between the NE Atlantic and western Australian continental margins. Paper no. 90022, AAPG Hedberg Conference, Stavanger, Norway, 8‚Äì11 Sept. American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Tulsa, Oklahoma. More recently, the Zenith Plateau is inferred to be a volcanic plateau that consists of a thick sequence of highly attenuated, stretched, and faulted volcanic margin crust formed during the time of the continental break-up of Gondwana. This crust is inferred to be buried by voluminous volcanic deposits that immediately followed its formation. Later on, complicated tectonic activity that was associated with local rifting and sea floor spreading separated the Wallaby and Zenith plateaus from Australia and each other.Gibbons, A. D., U.

Perth. 22 pp. Judging from research conducted for adjacent oceanic rises and plateaus, it is presumed that the volcanic rocks, which comprise the Zenith Plateau are covered by a blanket of Cenozoic and older deep sea sediments of unknown thickness. Research conducted during the 25th cruise of the R/V Dmitriy Mendeleyev indicates that the deep sea sediments covering the Zenith Plateau consist of calcareous ooze. One core, core 2036, recovered during that cruise penetrated of rather compact light pale yellow pelitic, coccolith-foraminiferal ooze. Radiocarbon dating of samples from the upper of the core yielded dates ranging from 9790¬±750 to greater than 28,500 years radiocarbon. The average sedimentation rate calculated for sediments in this core is to per thousand years. According to these rates and the core description, the sediments covering this plateau are likely well-consolidated and possibly quite stiff.Ivanov, Ye. I., V. I . Kiselev And A.M. Palkina, 1985, Temperatures in the Indian Ocean during the Quaternary. Oceanology. 25(4):499-503. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 The northern flank of the Zenith Plateau underlies the part of the Indian Ocean that was initially suspected to be the final resting place of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. According to the GEBCO Digital Atlas, the depth of the ocean bottom within the area that the ADV Ocean Shield detected acoustic signals that once were thought to be consistent with those emitted by underwater locator beacons (ULBs) mounted on flight recorders ranges from about to . However, lengthy searches of parts of the Zenith Plateau found nothing. Except for its depth, the blanket of foraminiferal ooze, which likely covers the Zenith Plateau, provides an environment that should be helpful for searching for any aircraft wreckage lying on the ocean bottom. According to William Sager, a professor of marine geophysics at the University of Houston in Texas, the surface of ocean bottom covered with foraminiferal ooze is soft enough to squeeze between a person's toes, but it's not so soft that airplane wreckage would sink into it. He stated: \\"Something big like pieces of an airplane, it's going to be sitting on the surface.\\"The Associated Press, 2014, Seabed of jet hunt zone mostly flat.

Origins Beevor was born 1811 at Norwich, Norfolk, England, into the family of James Beevor, a brewery proprietor at Norwich, and Mary Beevor (n√©e Rigby). He was descended from a prominent and titled Norfolk family, having a common ancestor with the Beevor baronets.Carter, Anne: The Beevor Story (Norwich 1993), . His older brother, Rev. Edward Rigby Beevor (1798‚Äì1878), graduated B.A. at Cambridge. Military service His father having sold the brewery, 20-year-old Beevor enlisted in the British Army on 3 October 1831 as an ensign in the East Suffolk Regiment of Foot.The London Gazette, 16 December 1831, p.2655. On 31 August 1832 he was promoted to lieutenant rank in that same regiment.United Service Magazine, 1832, Vol. 10, p. 284. In 1835 he eschewed the regular army to join the British Auxiliary Legion in the First Carlist War in Spain, serving as a cavalry captain in the 2nd Regiment Queen's Own Irish Lancers.United Service Journal, 1839, pp 366‚Äì367 His comrades there included Lieutenant Inman and Colonel Wakefield. Through them and others he was attracted to plans to establish a free colony in South Australia and, his father having died in 1836, decided to migrate there. South Australian colonist Beevor departed London in January 1839 aboard the barque City of Adelaide, along with 75 immigrants. The barque suffered many storms. Having been dismasted in the English Channel it returned to port for repairs, and then needed further repairs at Rio de Janeiro, not arriving at Port Adelaide until July 1839. Beevor promptly pioneered a sheep station northeast of Mount Barker, near Dawesley, on the eastern flanks of the Mount Lofty Ranges. His sheep run and homestead, then at the frontier of European settlement, was at the base of a prominent peak first discovered in January 1838 by European explorers Dr George Imlay and John Hill. That peak was consequently named Mount Beevor (498m). He there became firm friends with neighbouring pioneering pastoralists, the brothers Edward and Alexander Blucher Lodwick, who had arrived from London as cabin passengers aboard the ship Ganges in June 1839, about the same time that Beevor had landed. Known generally as Captain Beevor he took a prominent role in civic affairs, attending Government House levees and serving on grand juries, though not holding any official office. In June 1841 he was appointed by Governor Grey to command the party of some thirty fellow pastoralists who had volunteered to accompany a police party led by Commissioner O'Halloran on an expedition to the Rufus River. This had followed an Aboriginal attack on the overlanders Henry Inman and Henry Field and it culminated three months later in the events known as the Rufus River massacre. In that regard he had problems at his Mount Beevor home station, complaining of being constantly troubled by Aboriginal thefts, especially livestock. After Beevor (or one of his hired men) accidentally shot and killed an Aboriginal near his sheep yards (a ricochet from a warning shot) he lived in fear of retaliation from the man's relatives.Adelaide Advertiser, 28 July 1877, p. 2. Eyre Peninsula pioneer He therefore quit his Mount Beevor Station in 1844 with the intention of forming another at distant Eyre Peninsula in partnership with John Charles Darke. He did not realise he was leaving a bad situation for a worse one. In the end Beevor did not join up with the ill-fated Darke. He instead went into partnership with his former neighbour Alex Lodwick, the pair transferring their pastoralist operations to pioneer a remote sheep station about northwest of Port Lincoln at Mount Drummond. Having been granted a government occupation licence, they named it Taunto Station, building huts and yards while tending their expanding flocks. Death =Events concerning death= On 3 May 1849 Lodwick spent the day out with sheep while Beevor attended to chores at their Taunto hut, including making a rough bush chair. The previous night four transitory Aboriginal people, three men and one woman, spent the night hospitably at the homestead, but more were allegedly secreted nearby. When Lodwick returned at 5pm he found Beevor lying dead in front of the hut with two spears in him ‚Äì one from the front and one from the back. The hut had been ransacked of flour and clothing and all of the Aboriginal people were gone.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/50246274 Newspaper report. There being no sign of struggle, Coroner W.S. Peter, a close friend of Beevor whose neighbouring Warrow Station was away, concluded that the Aboriginal people had ambushed Beevor without warning, aided by his own formerly faithful Aboriginal servant.Register newspaper, 16 May 1849, p. 2. Colonists were shocked at this treachery because Beevor had a reputation for being a quiet, unassuming and kindly fellow who had extended great generosity toward Aboriginal people. =Trial and execution of murderers= Six Aboriginal men were arrested and charged with Beevor's murder or with being accessories. Tried at Adelaide, four were found not guilty, while two were convicted and sentenced to death. At the express wish of the three local J's. P., Henry Strong Price, W.S. Peter, and Charles J. Driver, the two condemned men, Needgalta and Kulgulta, were returned to the murder scene at Taunto station. On 9 November 1849 they were there hanged from a gum tree using a spring cart scaffold in front of assembled Aboriginal witnesses, for whom this was intended to serve as a salutary warning. Their bodies were buried at Port Lincoln Gaol.Port Lincoln Times, 6 November 1936, page 3. Eight weeks later, in January 1850, Beevor's disheartened partner Alexander Lodwick left South Australia forever, sailing to the California Gold Rush. Beevor's gravesite is unknown.

It is credited as the first graduate student labor union. Following voluntary recognition by the university as the teaching assistants' bargaining agent in 1969, negotiations resulted in a 1970 strike, which secured \\"bread-and-butter\\" gains such as job security alongside grievance procedures. Their major unmet demand from their strike‚Äîthe inclusion of teaching assistants and students in the course planning process‚Äîwent unfulfilled. The TAA struck again in 1980 and lost its union recognition until 1986. The union's protest at the Wisconsin State Capitol building began the 2011 Wisconsin protests.  History  Following an anti-draft sit-in on University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Bascom Hall in late May 1966, a small group of teaching assistants (TAs) organized to form the Teaching Assistants Association (TAA) in June and became the first graduate student labor union. Their original campaign goals were mostly \\"bread-and- butter\\": higher wages and better working conditions for TAs. In its first month, the TAA reaffirmed its connections to and roots in the anti-war movement and its calls for educational policy reform. The union struggled for graduate student support until February 1969, when Wisconsin State Assembly majority leader Republican Representative John C. Shabaz proposed a bill to remove tuition remission for graduate students on assistantship. The bill was introduced during the black strike as a component of a conservative strategy to rout out out-of-state UW students, a group blamed for campus discontent. While the faculty thought the bill wouldn't pass or would otherwise be vetoed, the TAA pledged to fight the bill and proposed that they become the TAs' official collective bargaining unit. Within weeks, they collected 1,100 members from 1,900 TAs and approached the university for recognition as the teaching assistants' bargaining agent. Citing a lack of legislative approval, campus chancellor H. Edwin Young declined, but reneged when a consequential strike loomed later in the semester. Young offered to bargain if a vote administered by the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission upheld the TAA's claim of majority representation. After two days of elections, the union became the students' official bargaining agent on May 18, 1969, with 77% of voters overall in support and 52 of 81 academic departments with TAs in majority consensus. With threats of striking, the Shabaz bill was rescinded. With recognition, the university voluntarily agreed in a Structure Agreement to acknowledge and negotiate with the graduate student union. In completing the lengthy agreement process, the university decided to hire a recent graduate to represent them. The bargaining process was complicated by the union's lack of experience, skepticism, political ideology, and decentralized nature. The TAA operated as a participatory democracy and, as such, did not have a consistent bargaining group, which led to recapitulation and confusion on both sides of the negotiation. The two parties struggled to find common ground on the union's demands for the \\"bread-and-butter\\" wages and working conditions alongside additional asks for academic and human rights, such as job security through continual employment guarantees, class size limits, health benefits, office environment standards of light levels and space requirements, policies intended to end discrimination, participation in university governance, and evaluation by teams of students, faculty, and TAs, evenly split. Among their more contentious requests was for departmental bargaining with the TAA to establish and institutionalize roles for students and TAs in designing courses where TAs were employed. The requests that eroded faculty authority were not well received by the faculty or other labor unions, with the Wisconsin AFL-CIO head suggesting the latter demand was \\"not a proper union issue\\". The TAA reaffirmed the importance of the \\"educational planning\\" demand for the future of their generation, and at one point, the university drafted a shared course design clause before it was removed in faculty resistance. = 1970 strike = TAA on strike in 1970 With negotiations deadlocked, the TAA set January 8, 1970 as their bargaining deadline to be followed by \\"unspecified action\\". They set March 15 as their strike deadline and despite a hurried attempt to make amends in the days preceding, the union rejected the latest offer and went on strike. It was the first staff strike in the university's history and it would last 24 days. Chancellor Young called the strike illegal by state law and against their agreed terms for bargaining. Consequently, the administration severed discussions when the strike started, and sought a court order to stop it. Local labor support was mixed, as Local 171 ignored the strike and Teamsters Local 695 honored picket lines, halting food delivery, buses, and liquid nitrogen lab service. Some undergraduates picketed with the TAA and some striking TAs held their classes off-campus. The strike reduced class attendance in the areas closest to the biggest picket site, Bascom Hill, in its related College of Letters and Science and School of Education. The strike was largely non-violent, but increased in militancy over time, especially as spring break approached. Groups such as the New Year's Gang and the Mother Jones Revolutionary League threatened physical harm if the union's demands weren't met, and similar radical influx emboldened some strikers and alienated others enough to leave. The TAA president and others were arrested on March 24 for blocking a delivery, and the union picketed delivery routes throughout the spring break from March until April. Around the same time, Teamsters relented and allowed their drivers to work, the university announced hundreds of TAs would receive reduced paychecks during the strike, and a circuit judge granted the attorney general's injunction petition: the strike was illegal and the TAs must return to work. The university and TAA negotiating an end to the 1970 strike In-person bargaining reconvened over the break, and the TAA's \\"educational planning\\" demand‚Äîthe major unmet demand for which they went on strike‚Äîwas off the table. While the demand engendered undergrad support and a similar provision was outlined in the 1969 Structure Agreement, the faculty were now fundamentally opposed. The university's proposal lacked the provision and was voted down at the April 5 TAA meeting, where they decided to continue the illegal strike. In the next two days, the Faculty Senate adopted a resolution that acknowledged the Structure Agreement's language but added that faculty hold the \\"ultimate responsibility ... for curriculum and course content\\". On April 7, the TAA voted against continuing the strike and accepted the university's latest offer in a vote of 534‚Äì348, and the Board of Regents approved the contract on April 10, 1970. State legislators were unhappy with the contract and at the request of the state's Joint Committee on Finance, the attorney general ruled on the contract's legality, finding it legal. The TAs had won union representation with bargaining rights and a contract that gave better job security and grievance procedures, though the TAA leadership and Daily Cardinal were unsure \\"who had won\\" the strike. = 1980 strike = TAA on strike in 1980 The TAA went on strike again in 1980 regarding education-related policy and university governance. In response, the university rescinded its recognition of their contract. The Wisconsin legislature began to recognize the union in 1986. = Act 10 and Recall Walker = Protests in the Capitol, February 14, 2012 The TAA led a 1,000-person protest at the Wisconsin State Capitol building on Valentine's Day in 2011, which began the 2011 Wisconsin protests, including a monthlong protest at the capitol. The union voted against endorsing a challenger in the 2012 recall election.  Legacy  The TAA is credited as the first graduate student labor union, and its formation preceded the unionization of several others graduate schools in the 1970s, including at the City University of New York (CUNY), Michigan, Oregon, and three universities in Florida. However, CUNY graduate students were covered in a 1968 union contract, which predated the TAA's first contract in 1970. UC Berkeley teaching assistants also had formed a union earlier under the American Federation of Teachers in December 1964, and had 400 members at one time,. \\"The teaching assistants thereupon, by December, formed another local of the AFT, and soon counted over 400 members,\\" but dissolved without winning recognition or a contract. This makes the TAA the first graduate student labor union to win recognition, and the first to negotiate an independent contract.

The technique builds on the retro-evolution hypothesis proposed in 1945 by geneticist Norman Horowitz.  Technique  The technique works backwards from the target to identify a precursor molecule and an enzyme that converts it into the target, and then a second precursor that can produce the first and so on until a simple, inexpensive molecule becomes the beginning of the series. For each precursor, the enzyme is evolved using induced mutations and natural selection to produce a more productive version. The evolutionary process can be repeated over multiple generations until acceptable productivity is achieved. The process does not require high temperature, high pressure, the use of exotic catalysts or other elements that can increase costs. The enzyme \\"optimizations\\" that increase the production of one precursor from another are cumulative in that the same precursor productivity improvements can potentially be leveraged across multiple target molecules.  Didanosine  In 2014 the technique was used to produce the HIV drug didanosine. A simpler molecule was identified that can be converted into didanosine when subjected to a specific chemical transformation in the presence of a specific enzyme. The gene that creates the enzyme was then \\"copied\\", adding random mutations to each copy using ribokinase engineering. The mutant genes were inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria and used to produce (now-mutant) enzymes. The enzymes were then mixed with the precursor and the mutant enzymes that produced the greatest amount of didanosine were retained and replicated. One mutant stimulated a 50x increase in didanosine production. The first step was repeated, using the first precursor in place of didanosine, finding a yet simpler precursor and an enzyme to produce it. One mutated enzyme produced a 9,500x increase in nucleoside production. A third retrogression allowed them to start with the simple and inexpensive sugar named dideoxyribose and produce didanosine in a three-step sequence.

The reservoir is located within the Manly Dam Reserve. The dam was designed by the NSW Department of Public Works and built in 1892 by the Department. The reservoir and dam is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The reservoir and dam was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Manly Dam was built in 1892 by the NSW Department of Public Works as a water supply dam for the Manly area, which was progressively called on to supply neighbouring suburbs such as Balgowlah and Seaforth and eventually the coastal strip of the former Warringah Shire, to as far north as Mona Vale. The gravity dam was constructed as a mass concrete structure with a maximum height of and length of . Its catchment area covers to Frenchs Forest. The dam was constructed by the NSW Department of Public Works for the local council under a special Act of Parliament as part of a complete water supply scheme for Manly. It consisted of a dam, pumping station, rising main, service reservoir and reticulation. It was operated by the council for ten years until it was resumed by the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board in January 1902, at its original cost of A‚Ç§37,820, less the amount the council had paid off already. The concrete dam was designed to hold and was upgraded in 1909 with an enlarged by-wash being excavated on the eastern side and the old by-wash built up, thus enabling the top level of the reservoir to be raised and the storage capacity increased to . In 1914, the capacity was raised further to and then in 1922 to with the top water level being . In 1920, a filtration plant was installed, consisting of a settling and coagulating basin, gravel and sand filter beds, inspection chambers and a clear water basin. By 1928, increasing demand for water had overtaken the dam's capacity and in 1929, it was phased out, with supply for Warringah and Manly being provided by pipeline from the main metropolitan system at Pymble Reservoir. In 1936, the pumping installation was dismantled, following the commissioning of an amplified connection to the main metropolitan system, the completion of a reservoir at Rocky Hill and the progressive development of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Despite this, during an extensive drought period from 1934-1942, the dam was again brought into service, with pumps transferred from Engadine. During a nine and a half month period up to October 1942, of water were drawn to supplement Sydney's supply. From 1942, parts of the former water treatment plant downstream of the dam were reused in association with a hydraulics laboratory set up by the Department of Water Conservation and Irrigation. The Department of Public Works set up similar facilities in 1944. The Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board also established water hydraulics experimental facilities and in 1955, the University of Technology (now the University of NSW) also established hydraulics laboratories. These facilities remain in use, although ownership and administration has varied between departments at times. The dam wall was strengthened in 1979-81 to bring the dam up to current safety standards. The methods used involved the sinking of long, vertical, steel tendons into the rock foundations but free in the dam wall itself, to permit future load monitoring and adjustment, and then anchored in heads specially designed for these tests on the crest of the dam. This technique was considered revolutionary at the time and gained world recognition when a paper was presented by Sydney Water Board engineers to the 14th Congress of the International Commission on Large Dams in Rio de Janeiro in 1982.  Description  The dam is a mass concrete gravity structure with a maximum height of and a length of . The dam wall impounds the Curl Curl Creek some north west of Manly with a catchment area of approximately extending to Frenchs Forest in the north. The catchment area and stored water of the dam are now used primarily for public recreation. The stored water is also utilised as a supply for the adjoining hydraulic investigation laboratories of Sydney Water, the Public Works Department, and the University of New South Wales. The dam wall and its associated features appear to be in good condition and intact. Between 1979 and 1981, it was strengthened using a new method of vertical steel tendons anchored onto rock foundations and the crest of the dam; also known as post-tensioning.  Heritage listing  As at 9 May 2005, Manly Dam was a representative example of a medium-sized, concrete gravity dam of the late nineteenth century, as regards both design and construction. It has historical significance for its role in the historical development of Sydney's water supply, in particular as being an independent scheme, built despite the fact that the renowned first stage of the Upper Nepean Scheme, a comprehensive, long-term scheme with capacity for progressive augmentation by the successive construction of major dams on the contributing rivers, had recently been completed. It has technical significance as a representative example of its type and for the pioneering strengthening methodology which was developed for this dam. The dam is a rare remnant of an independent water supply system within the Sydney Metropolitan Area, providing evidence of the progressive and independent development of Sydney's suburbs, and has local aesthetic value. The former treatment plant and pumping station buildings are also significant but are not owned by the Sydney Water Corporation. Manly Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The dam is the largest example of an independent water supply system within the Sydney Metropolitan Area. The dam played an important role as an independent water supply scheme for the northern beaches area of Sydney. The dam is a relic of the period when the northern beaches were remote from the major areas of settlement in Sydney, prior to the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The dam was designed and built by the NSW Department of Public Works and is associated with the prominent engineers in this department at this time, particularly, E. O. Moriarty and C. W. Darley . The dam is an early example of the government initiative of the early 1890s, allowing local councils to raise loans for water supply purposes. The dam is one of the last of its size and type designed by the NSW Dept of Public Works as a gravity wall, prior to the general adoption of curved concrete walls for small dams. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Manly Dam is a simple and attractive construction, located in a picturesque setting. The dam is a good example of a basic concrete-walled gravity dam. The dam is an impressive structure, with its relatively thin wall standing between the water body of the reservoir on the west and the void and valley floor on the east. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Manly Dam is highly regarded by the public as represented by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), as evidenced by its identification in the National Trust Register. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Manly Dam is a century-old, mass-concrete gravity dam which has no operational imperative, making it an ideal facility for a range of experimental and research activities. Manly Dam is of technical significance for its association with the Hydraulics Laboratories in the former water treatment plant and its continuing role in the provision of experimental facilities. The dam is the site of on-going testing and monitoring of the wall-strengthening methodology pioneered at this dam. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Manly Dam is the largest and most developed of the surviving Sydney regional independent water supply schemes. Manly Dam is one of the very few substantial dam structures located within the suburbs of Sydney. Manly Dam was the site of a dam strengthening program which pioneered a world-first technology and which has subsequently become an accepted procedure for this purpose. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Manly Dam is a representative example of a small concrete gravity dam structure of the late nineteenth century. Manly Dam is representative of a range of small dams erected for water supply purposes in NSW by the NSW Department of Public Works between the 1890s and 1930s.

History  = The start = Henri Tudor from Rosport created in 1890 what will become later the Tudor batteries brand: the Soci√©t√© anonyme Franco-Belge pour la fabrication de l‚Äôaccumulateur Tudor (Franco-Belgian anonymous society for the manufacture of the Tudor Accumulator). At that time, more than 1200 Tudor batteries were in service in Belgium and abroad including Germany, France, Austria, Spain, Egypt, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Argentina. The emblem was the name of the brand with the head of a griffin, which originated in the family of Henri Tudor's uncle, Robert Leadbitter from Newcastle-on-Tyne in Northumberland Henri Werner, Ernest Reiter, Henri Owen Tudor. An Idea ... and Where it Led, Rosport 2012,(), pages 26-27. Tudor had licensed his brand in many countries like Germany (Accumulatoren-Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft (AFA)) and Spain (la Sociedad Espa√±ola Del Acumulador). In 1901, Henri Tudor decided to change the name of the firm to Soci√©t√© anonyme des accumulateurs Tudor (Joint-stock company of the Tudor Accumulators) with operating sites in Lille and Florival. Later in 1908, the Rosport site was closed Henri Werner, Ernest Reiter, Henri Owen Tudor. An Idea ... and Where it Led, Rosport 2012,(), pages 106-168. As Tudor Spain became more profitable, the shareholding shifted and AFA became the majority shareholder in 1903 Oskar Clemens, 50 Jahre Accumulatoren-Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft 1888-1938, Berlin/Hagen/Wien, AFA, 1938, page 77. Tudor imported equipment from Germany. Former Tudor logo = During World War I = When the first world war broke out in 1914, AFA removed from Tudor Spain's capital. Three directors resigned and the situation was critical. However, in 1916, Tudor Spain became the supplier of two starting batteries models manufactured in Spain. In others European countries during WWI, plants were completely plundered, like in Belgium and in Luxembourg. These events will not hinder the company to have, between the two world wars nearly 25,000 employees at the Florival plant. In 1920, Tudor Spain supplied the first battery for a submarine (Isaac Peral), with funding from The Akkumulator Fabrik AG. Tudor Accumulator - Accumulates Success = The succession = In 1928, after Henri Tudor‚Äôs death, his son John took the succession as Managing director of ‚ÄúAccumulateurs Tudor‚Äù During the following years, the traction battery market will strongly rise. However, the first expansion of their plants were based on stationary batteries. For these facilities, the company proposed service contracts under which it bound up with keeping the battery in good working order for a period of ten years against a fixed remuneration. From 1931, ¬´Accumulateurs Tudor¬ª introduced widely the traction battery which is especially used for the industry handling equipment. In 1939, Tudor batteries France made the acquisition of the Belgian Society of Fulmen accumulator S.A. with its 5900 m2 site located in Leeuw- St.Pierre. = After World War II = * From 1945, la Soci√©t√© anonyme Accumulateurs Tudor became one of the main starter batteries suppliers for the automotive industry. * In 1948 the capital of the company was increased to 30 million Francs * During the fifties, the traction battery market expanded considerably following the needs for reconstruction and development of handling equipment. * In 1957, Auguste Charles Laval became CEO of Tudor France and started a corporate restructuring with the centralization of the manufacturing on the Florival site. * In 1965, Tudor enhances its quality image by becoming the exclusive large automotive OEM brands including Ford, Peugeot and Renault. * About 1967, the Florival plant had around 600 workers. It produced 4.000 accumulators a day. A car on two in Belgium runs with a Tudor accumulator. = Two successive recessions = The 1974 recession was keenly felt. The first half of 1981 was characterized by a new crisis resulting in technical unemployment and a deficit. In 1982, the plant underwent thirteen days strike while production was one million pieces per year. The company suffered from the global overcapacity in the starter battery, which represented 65% of revenues. The goal was to reduce this proportion to 50%. Sales were divided between Germany, Benelux and France, with a predominance of the French market. The competition was Japanese, but also Europe with the establishment of a major General Motors production plant in Sarreguemines. The lifetime of the batteries significantly lengthened, and replacements became less frequent. = Additional investment = A continuous casting installation of grids, representing an investment of one million dollars, was commissioned in 1982. At the trays, antique ebony gave way to lighter and more resistant polymers. The stationary battery was the subject of high demand in the area of preventing interruptions (telephone exchanges, operating rooms, computer rooms). Batteries handling equipment however accounted for 70% of turnover of industrial battery. = Integration in a global economy = Eventually, The Florival site (in the city of Grez-Doiceau) suffered from its initial geographical limits. In 1990, the ‚ÄúSoci√©t√© Anonyme Tudor accumulators\\" was absorbed by the C.E.A.C.(European Accumulators Company) based in Gennevilliers (France) which was a French-Italian company. C.E.A.C., well-known for its Fulmen brand, thus became also owner of the Tudor brand in some country. The production activities of the Florival site were reduced gradually. In October 1994, Exide Technologies took over the ‚ÄúSocietad Espa√±ola del Accumulador Tudor‚Äù. The Spanish company was, with Tudor India and Tudor Swedish, one of the last social reasons to keep using Tudor brand. In 1995 Exide Technologies also took C.E.A.C. The Florival site became a distribution center.  References   Further reading  * Batteries Tudor Marathon.

Served by the Salt Lake City International Airport and less than a two-hour flight from Silicon Valley, CA, Silicon Slopes has been recognized in news media as an emerging force in the technology sector, including NPR coverage about the NSA Utah Data Center in the region. The region encompasses a cluster of information technology, software development, and hardware manufacturing and research firms along the Wasatch Front. Some of the better known companies with facilities at Silicon Slopes are memory process technology companies SanDisk and Intel/Micron Technology joint venture IM Flash Technologies, video game software development company EA Sports, e-commerce company eBay, data analysis software firm Adobe Systems, and banking and technology services company Zions Bank Silicon Slopes is one of a growing number of technology communities (see List of places with \\"Silicon\\" names) and technology centers (see List of technology centers) gaining status from their relationship to or similarity with Silicon Valley, California.  Etymology  The term Silicon Slopes is the brainchild of Josh James (founder and CEO of Domo) for the purpose of creating a branding campaign to promote Utah's growing technology community. The nickname is derived from \\"Silicon Valley,\\" substituting Utah's mountains (slopes) for Northern California's Santa Clara Valley.  History  Historically, the region had been home to a state prison and farmland and little else. Utah's decades-long history of government contract work and innovative Utah businesses' early involvement in the tech industry, include the creation of the Internet as the fourth node of ARPANET. These foundations were built over years, and established Utah's ability to become a leading technology center. Utah also has a strong Internet backbone; it was a Google Fiber early expansion city with service now available in Provo and Salt Lake City. = Government partnerships = Utah has a long history of partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense that have contributed to laying the groundwork for the state's high-tech business environment and infrastructure. David C. Evans, a native of Salt Lake City, was one of the original pioneers of computer science in Utah and its groundbreaking work with the DoD. During the early 1960s, Evans worked as the head of the computer science department at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was also in charge of the university's work for the Pentagon's Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). In 1965, Evans was recruited back to Salt Lake City to create a computer science department at the University of Utah, and brought DoD contacts with him, including Ivan Sutherland. Evans and Sutherland continued their work on ARPA for the DoD with their colleagues in California and helped to establish ARPANET, an \\"early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP.\\" Both of these technologies form the technical foundation of the internet. In 1969, the University of Utah was one of the original four nodes of ARPANET, cementing its place in military and technological history. Due to this early partnership with the DoD, Utah was able to encourage more joint ventures with the military. Not only was Utah capable of developing high-tech infrastructure, many geographic and natural characteristics were appealing to the DoD. Utah is geographically isolated from both the east and west coasts, providing higher security and less vulnerability to attacks. Utah also has a low incidence of large-scale natural disasters and wide open spaces that provide enough room for chemical weapons testing and drone pilot training. Some notable Utah partnerships with the U.S. military include Hill Air Force Base, Utah Test and Training Range, Dugway Proving Ground, and the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility. In recent years, Utah has also become home to a growing number of big data processing centers. Some of these are government partnerships, such as the largest NSA data storage facility in the United States, located in Bluffdale, Utah. In order to meet the demand and facilitate more partnerships, the University of Utah recently added a new Big Data certificate program within its School of Computing. The program began in the Fall of 2014. Utah is already ahead of the curve in the national trend on big data, and training students how to understand the technicality of big data analysis will continue to attract business and military operations to Utah. = Local tech businesses = Examples of early local tech businesses and founders that helped attract more start-ups to the area include: Evans & Sutherland, founded in Salt Lake City by David Evans and Ivan Sutherland in 1968, as the world's first computer graphics company (in operation for over four decades supplying advanced computer graphics technologies to the market); David C. Evans, founder and first chairman of the University of Utah School of Computing from 1965-1973; James H. Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, Inc; John Warnock, a co-founder of Adobe Systems; Alan Ashton, co-founder of Wordperfect; Edwin Catmull, co-founder of Pixar. The Utah tech scene started with WordPerfect and Novell in 1979. Novell, Inc., a software development company founded in 1979 by Ray Noorda, produced software to connect desktop computers so they could share peripheral devices, like a printer (computing) and hard disks. As the price of desktop computers began to fall, Novell captured a large segment of the market with its Netware program. At their height in the early 1990s, Novell controlled 65% of the market for network operating systems in the high-tech industry. A second tech wave in Utah came in the 1990s, based on the founding of Omniture. During that same period, the 2002 Winter Olympics raised the profile of Utah on the world stage. The 2009 acquisition of Omniture by Adobe in 2009 for $1.8 billion led Adobe to establish a permanent presence in Utah. = Past political leadership = Governor Michael Leavitt (1993‚Äì2003) was instrumental in luring many tech companies to Utah. During his time in office, Leavitt made monthly trips to Silicon Valley and used his slogan, \\"We have workers, we have space, we have proximity,\\" to increase his influence there. He specifically highlighted the challenges facing the Silicon Valley region: natural geographic boundaries and traffic congestion. Utah, he maintained, was the place to grow with ease. Leavitt was a key factor in enticing eBay to locate their main customer service center in Utah and in bringing in new research operations for Intel. Governor Leavitt laid the groundwork for his successors to build on his achievements and continue to make Utah a business-friendly state, particularly for high-tech companies. = Banking history = Utah's economic stability is also reflected in its history as a center for industrial banks and as a secondary financial hub for investment banks like Goldman Sachs that encourage venture capitalism in the state. Industrial banks, also known as Industrial Loan Corporations (ILCs), are a niche form of banking that is nearly exclusively located in Utah. Examples of Utah ILCs include BMW Bank, Pitney Bowes Bank, and Target Bank. Due to this distinction, Utah is the fourth- largest center for state-chartered banking in the nation, with nearly $280 billion in assets within its borders. Utah's industrial banks began in the early 1900s before Congress passed the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which severed the ties between banking and commercial corporations. Utah's ILCs were grandfathered in, so Utah's industrial-bank charter is not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. This means that the ILCs are not regulated by the Federal Reserve; they are overseen by the FDIC and Utah's Department of Financial Services. This allows the banks to be free from more onerous federal regulation and also allows them to be more responsive to changes in the economy. By providing sound oversight in this area of banking, Utah has built credibility in the marketplace and earned a distinguished reputation in banking. This has helped to create the pro-business climate that is attractive to venture capitalists and start-up technology companies. Evidence of the prominence of the Silicon Slopes tech industry is the growing amount of venture capital coming into the area. In the first nine months of 2014, the dollar-per-deal average in the Silicon Slopes was the highest in the country, at an average of $51.3 million per deal. This high average can be attributed to big deals with key players such as Qualtrics and Domo. Qualtrics, a customer analytics software firm, brought in $150 million in venture capital funding in September 2014.  Economy  Utah has often been ranked as one of the top five states for businesses.https://www.forbes.com/best-states-for- business/list/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/americas-top-states-for- business-2019.html There is a continuous focus on creating partnerships between businesses, government, education, and communities. The Governor's Office of Economic Development is based on Governor Gary Herbert's commitment to economic development statewide. In the most recent State New Economy Index, performed by the Kauffman Foundation in 2010, Utah was ranked first in the nation for Economic Dynamism and inventor patents, while ranking third in fastest-growing firms. = Notable companies = Notable companies with locations in the Silicon Slopes region include: * 1-800 Contacts * Adobe * Ancestry.com * Authorize.Net * Backcountry * Cisco * doTerra * Bluehost * Control4 * DevMountain * DigiCert * Discover Card * Domo * eBay * Engineering Animation * Facebook * Henry Schein (Formally Dentrix) * IM Flash * Instructure * LANDesk * LexisNexis * Lingotek * Microsoft * Micro Focus (formerly NOVELL) * MokiMobility * Nature's Sunshine * NortonLifeLock (formerly Symantec) * NICE InContact * Northrop Grumman * Nu Skin * Oracle * Overstock * Pluralsight * Podium * Proofpoint * Purple * Qualtrics * SanDisk * SirsiDynix * StubHub * SUSE * Usana * Venafi * Vivint * Workday * Workfront * Xactware * Zions Bank = Notable government facilities = * NSA Utah Data Center * Hill Air Force Base * Utah Test and Training Range * Dugway Proving Ground * Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility = Economic development = Utah's economic stability has grown to meet the standards of the tech giants that occupy the Silicon Slopes area made possible in 2009 by Governor Gary Herbert who focused on four cornerstones to strengthen the economy of Utah: jobs, energy, education and self-determination. Governor Herbert credits the economic momentum in Utah to collaboration between corporate and government partnerships. The Governor's Office of Economic Development, led by Spencer P. Eccles, coordinated with Governor Herbert to build on the economic development cornerstones, calling it economic development 2.0. The updated objectives to help sustain the economic growth in Utah, allowing the Silicon Slope regions to expand, strengthen, and grow existing Utah businesses, increase innovation, entrepreneurship and investment, national and international business, and prioritize education to develop the workforce of the future.  Demographics  Fall colors in Utah = Location, climate and geography = Utah's location is enticing to both companies and employees. With close proximity to the Rocky Mountains, many activities are available year-round. Four distinct seasons offer such year-round activities as skiing, hiking, and rock climbing. Utah also has many national parks, including Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Canyonlands National Park. Salt Lake City is a Delta Airlines hub and is perfectly situated to allow for business day trips from Silicon Valley due to direct, 90-minute flights that cut travel expenses and limit travel time. Utah offers many incentives that are more attractive than other cities in the Western region: the cost of living is lower than in Seattle or Portland; the climate is not as hot as Phoenix or Albuquerque; geographic proximity is closer than Austin, allowing for less travel time and cost; and the ski slopes can be reached in less than an hour, unlike Denver. = Workforce = Utah boasts a highly educated, technologically proficient, multilingual workforce, speaking over 130 languages. Many residents of Utah lived and worked abroad which contributes to the flexibility and capabilities of immediately contributing to companies. Utah also maintains the youngest population in the United States due to its higher-than-average birth rate. The median age in Utah is 29.6 years, compared to the nationwide median of 37.3 years. This young labor force is very attractive to employers as baby boomers throughout the nation retire and many states find it difficult to replenish their workforce due to falling birth rates. = Schools = Prominent schools that contribute to the Utah workforce include three major universities, Brigham Young University, University of Utah and Utah State University having a primary emphasis on entrepreneurship, innovation, and research and development, followed by Utah Valley University, Weber State University, Salt Lake Community College, Southern Utah University, Dixie State University and Westminster College. In the early 2000s, the Utah Legislature allocated around $100 million to the state's universities in order to bolster their computer science programs and significantly increase the number of graduates in the field. The universities also provided matching funding and created many new courses and areas of technological study. Computer science graduates continue to rise in Utah, with Northern Utah universities boasting 663 graduate students in 2013, up 47 percent from 2009. Of the six schools listed above, students graduating in Computer Science with a bachelor's degree have risen 44 percent since 2009. Students graduating with a master's degree rose 46 percent and those getting doctorates increased by 61 percent. These computer science programs are garnering interest due to demand from the companies found in the Silicon Slopes. As of August 2015, the Utah Technology Council achieved \\"mainstreaming Computer Science\\" in high schools by allowing students to take credited rigorous Computer Science courses as a Science credit option. = Infrastructure = A key contributor to Silicon Slopes' successful tech industry is the well-planned Internet infrastructure. Salt Lake City is in a fortunate geographic location because it sits along the major east-west Internet corridor where ten major service providers interconnect with each other and deliver high-speed services to the area. This \\"internet backbone\\" is a critical aspect of Utah's high-tech industry success. In Provo, the city government started planning a fiber-optic Internet infrastructure in the late 1990s. This high-speed Internet system was funded as a private-public partnership called iProvo and construction was completed in 2006. Google Fiber later acquired iProvo in 2013 and now offers Internet speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s for businesses and households. In response to the high-tech industry located in Salt Lake City and its relationship with Provo, Google officially announced in March 2015 that Salt Lake City would be one of the next places to receive Google Fiber. Construction is currently ongoing, but significant progress has been made, and residents and businesses will soon be able to sign-up for lightning-fast internet service. Requests for business permits in the area have drastically increased in response to the soon-to-be-available service.  Corporate recruitment  The State of Utah has offered a variety of incentives to encourage large tech companies to call Utah home, and the Silicon Slopes uprising would suggest that these perks have been motivating. The Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development allows a variety of grants and tax incentives to companies willing to either relocate or expand their enterprise, depending on the stability of the company and the types of jobs that are being brought to the state. From the state's perspective, they are trying to attract companies with positions that require a high level of education or skill to motivate Utah graduates to remain here in the state and help drive economic growth. Numerous publications and studies rank Utah as one of the top \\"best states for business\\" and most \\"fiscally fit\\" In the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's \\"Enterprising States\\" report, Utah ranks in the top five in every export category and was the only state to finish in the top 10 for all six metrics. Utah tops Governing Magazine's list of the best managed states. = Corporation requirements = To qualify for the tax benefits or grant programs associated with the Silicon Slopes region, there are specific guidelines in place to determine if the state will offer incentives to encourage relocation. These incentives are evaluated on a case by case basis by the Governor's Office and the Executive Director. Some of these standards include the industry the company is in, historical successes of the company, revenues that are raised and the types of jobs that were created. The jobs that are being brought in need to require specific qualifications and maintain certain salaries to maintain a well-educated, professional workforce within the state. To monitor these qualifications, grants and tax credits are only awarded after each corporation has proven its ability to provide the jobs and revenue required. = Rural development = A motivational factor for the State of Utah to provide incentives to corporations for expansion or relocation is the development of rural areas or deteriorating regions. The Silicon Slopes region is located between two of Utah's largest metropolises, Salt Lake City and Provo. Historically, this area has been largely underdeveloped, with the exception of the much smaller cities of Alpine, Highland, American Fork, Lehi, Pleasant Grove, Lindon, and Orem City. Orem is the largest of the group, with a population of just under 100,000. To accelerate the development of this area and surrounding areas, the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED) established the Economic Development Tax Increment Financing (EDTID) tax credit. Additionally, the Utah Office of Rural Development created the Utah Enterprise Zone Tax Credit to motivate business to choose locations that would benefit these rural areas. These credits can compound depending on employee wages compared to surrounding businesses, and are structured to encourage strong economic growth and professional retention to the area. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also partnered with the State of Utah to provide other motivating factors to prospective employees of Silicon Slope companies. Homes can be purchased with specifically structured mortgages that require little to no down payment, and can include extra financing to update or refurnish older homes.

It describes diplomacy that is performed in a group of countries and / or organizations (governmental and non -governmental) or other entities in international politics, dealing with specific topics or issues. It recognizes that the topics of the modern global agenda are: *Global and trans-national, that no country can deal with on its own (such as climate change, terrorism, war, poverty, or infectious diseases). *Too complex and complicated to address as a whole, and are required to be dismantled and taken apart into smaller sub-topics that can be addressed and treated in a practical manner. *There are many difficulties in promoting issues in forums with large numbers of member states, representing different interests, different administration methods and diverse economic capabilities. Multilateralism has sometimes proved unable to significantly advance global policy issues within existing frameworks. Therefore, ad hoc frameworks are established, with a limited number of participants, dealing with specific issues. Hence the use of the term \\"Mini \\": a forum consisting of a limited number of members, dealing with defined subject matters. The term seems to have been coined by Venezuelan scholar Mois√©s Na√≠m in an article for Foreign Policy. {{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YHRAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA14&q;=who+coined+minilateralism|title=Minilateralism : The Magic Number to Get Real International Action|last=Na√≠m|first=Mois√©s|date=2009-08-01|access- date=2020-04-21|language=en-US}. In this same magazine, Stewart Patrick describes that in order to promote significant global policies, the smallest number of states or countries needed to create the greatest impact on a specific subject should be brought to the table. For example, the G20 , a forum of 20 countries representing 85% of global GDP, which can be handled more effectively and more practically than, say, the World Trade Organization of nearly 200 members.

This was a safe Unionist seat that a Liberal had not won since 1857. The Unionists held the seat. He was then Liberal candidate for the Kensington North division of London at the 1923 General Election. This was a Unionist seat and not a good prospect either as the Liberals had come third in 1922. However, he did manage to increase the Liberal share of the vote; Kensington North in the County of London, showing boundaries used in 1923 He did not contest the 1924 General Election. He was then Liberal candidate for the Bermondsey West division of London at the 1929 General Election. This was a Labour seat that the Liberals had last won in 1923. He might have entertained hopes of regaining the seat, however the Unionists who had not run a candidate in 1923, chose to intervene.

The building was never finished, and is still unknown which pharaoh was the owner, since no appropriate inscription have been found. The pyramid was rediscovered in 1910 by Ernest Mackay and excavated in the following year by Flinders Petrie.Flinders Petrie, G. A. Wainwright, E. Mackay: The Labyrinth, Gerzeh and Mazghuneh, London 1912, available online. Attribution Plan of the Southern Mazghuna pyramid. The building shares some structural similarities to the Hawara pyramid of Amenemhat III, and for this reason it is usually attributed to his son Amenemhat IV (around the end of the 19th-century BCE). In parallel, the near northern Mazghuna pyramid is considered to be the tomb of his sister Sobekneferu, the last ruler of the 12th Dynasty. However, some researchers such as William C. HayesW.C. Hayes, The Scepter of Egypt. A Background for the Study of American Antiquites in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. From the Earliest times to the End of the Middle Kingdom, New York, 1953. believed that the southern pyramid was built during the 13th Dynasty, on the basis of some similarities with the pyramid of Khendjer.

The Founder, Ursula Kazarian, and the Executive Director, Serda Ozbenian, are based in the United States. The Armenia office includes Armine Sargsyan, Armenia Office Director, and Armenuhi Nikoghosyan, Project Manager.

This way, AEN is active in environmental problems in Armenia, and also creates a dialogue between Armenia and the Diaspora. In Armenia, AEN focuses on waste management through project implementation and education programs. The Vardenis Environmental Education Initiative (VEEI), part of AEN's Waste Management Program,AEN's Integrated Waste Management Program was implemented with the goal of bringing environmental education into the classroom. Teachers of the Vardenis sub-region were trained on teaching methodologies, basic ecology, and waste management using the AEN Teacher's Guide, specifically developed for use in rural Armenia. Other projects include constructing Armenia's first modern landfill in the city of Berd. AEN also holds Youth Forums, which are designed to inform Armenia's youth from regions outside of Yerevan on environmental issues. In the United States, AEN is working to expand its activities in cities with strong Armenian-American communities, with the hope to one day also expand to other Diasporan communities outside the U.S. AEN has organized environmental panel discussions in the U.S. since 2007, with topics ranging from deforestation and illegal logging to public health, water and sanitation, energy security, and the role of transparency in environmental work.

The term was apparently coined by Lord Foulkes and was used by Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray in 2009. It gained greater prominence during 2013, after mainstream media sources reported that Sir Chris Hoy had been subject to online abuse for expressing his support for unionism in Scotland. The Daily Telegraph reported in March 2014 that a retired soldier had received some abusive messages from Cybernats, after SNP politician Roseanna Cunningham posted a message on Twitter showing a letter from the soldier asking for donations to Better Together. In June 2014 the author JK Rowling was subjected to online abuse by Cybernats after donating to Better Together.Daily Telegraph The Herald stated in February 2013 that: \\"The problem is not limited to the nationalist side of the referendum debate, with the SNP complaining of Unionist \\"unitrolls\\" spreading online abuse.\\" It also reported that the Yes Scotland campaign would monitor blog sites and Twitter in an attempt to police offensive comments by supporters of independence. Christopher Stevenson, a British Unionist and a fire safety technician from Glasgow, was convicted in August 2014 of behaving in a \\"threatening or abusive manner\\" for stating on Twitter that he \\"might assassinate Alex Salmond\\". Stevenson, who argued in court that his statement was meant as a joke, had sentence deferred for one year. During the 2015 UK general election campaign, Labour called on the SNP to disown their candidate for Edinburgh South, Neil Hay, who had posted abusive comments on Twitter about Scottish unionists and elderly voters. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, condemned the comments but also pointed out that a Labour activist, Ian Smart, had abused nationalists. Labour subsequently suspended Smart from membership of the party. Charles Kennedy, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, was the target of on-line abuse during the campaign and immediately after the election. One person who had posted comments directed at Kennedy using a personal Twitter account was identified as Brian Smith, an SNP constituency official; the party declared that his comments were inappropriate and Smith quickly resigned.The ScotsmanBBC News  Polling  In March 2014 a Survation poll for the Scottish Sunday Express found that around 13% of Scots had been subject to abuse either online or face to face.

Dissatisfied with trapping, Roberts left to pursue studies in La Ronge and Yorkton, eventually finding work as an airfreight radio operator and a Cree‚ÄìEnglish translator. This experience led to him being offered a job as a broadcast radio announcer by the Department of Northern Saskatchewan.

He is on the board of the International Association of Tibetan Studies and is Editor-in-Chief of The Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies (JIATS), a leading journal of Tibetology. In 2000, he founded the Tibetan and Himalayan Library, a digital initiative for collaborative building of knowledge on the region, which he continues to lead as Director. Since 2008 he has also been the co-director of the UVa Tibet Center. More recently, Germano acted as the founding director of SHANTI (Sciences, Humanities and the Arts Network of Technological Initiatives) at the UVa. Since 2011, Germano has also played a leading role in organizing the University of Virginia's Contemplative Sciences Center, which he currently directs.  Education  He received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) from the University of Notre Dame, and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), from University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he focused in Buddhist Studies and Tibetan Studies. He has also spent over a decade living and studying in various parts of Asia, particularly in regions with high concentrations of Tibetans and other Himalayan Buddhists are located - Tibet, China, Bhutan, India, and Nepal.\\"Living Relics of the Buddha(s) in Tibet,\\" Germano, David. Embodying the Dharma: Buddhist Relic Veneration in Asia. Edited by David Germano and Kevin Trainor. Albany: State University of New York, 2004. 51-92.  Research interests  Germano's research interests include philosophical and contemplative traditions in Tibet, particularly Dzogchen in the Nyingma and B√∂n traditions and Tibetan historical literature. He also researches on the contemporary state of Tibetan religion in relationship to China and non- monastic yogic communities in cultural Tibet. He is currently working on a fourfold set of works constituting a comprehensive analysis of the Great Perfection Seminal Heart (rdzogs chen snying thig) tradition from its early formation to its full expression in the fourteenth century within the works of Longchenpa. This will include a deeply annotated translation of one of Longchenpa's major works, The Treasury of Words and Meanings (tshig don mdzod) and detailed studies of the Seminal Heart tradition itself from historical, philosophical, and literary perspectives respectively.  Publications and academic contributions  Dr. Karma Phuntsho and Dr. David Germano - Thimphu, Bhutan. 4 August 2013 Germano's academic work primarily focuses around two complementary poles: the contours of Nyingma philosophy, doctrine, and practice (particularly as found in the Dzogs chen school) and how these religious lineages have been interacted with, embodied, and understood throughout Tibetan history. Germano is passionate that contemporary academic work support, benefit, and honor the preservation of Tibetan culture and Tibetan ways-of-life today, giving rise to many of his academic projects. In particular, much of the work David leads at the Tibetan and Himalayan Library has been geared towards not only making academic resources accessible for Tibetans, but also towards mapping and collecting traditional knowledge of Tibetan peoples today. A sampling of the collaborative work Germano leads includes the Tibetan Place Dictionary, the Tibetan Map Collection, and the Tibetan Audio-Video Archive. Beyond these specific projects, Germano organizes several important programs to bring Tibetan thinkers to study in America and facilitate the development of long-lasting academic connections between Tibetan and American scholars, including the University of Virginia Tibetan Entrepreneurs Program and the Education to Employment Initiative. As part of his interest in supporting contemporary Tibetan peoples, Germano also works to introduce those outside Tibetan cultural areas to the richness and depth of traditional Tibetan culture. He has written numerous encyclopedia articles and annotated textual entries for the Encyclopedia of Religion (Macmillan Reference, 2004) and Religions of Tibet in Practice (Princeton University Press, 1997). He has also been involved with numerous documentary works on traditional Tibetan arts, including the 2004 documentary Tibetan Furniture Making: Traditions and Innovations, produced for the Pacific Asian Art Museum in Los Angeles, CA. In 2014, Germano was the keynote speaker for the Mind and Life Institute conference \\"Contemplation in Contexts: Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Across the Boundaries of the Humanities and Sciences.\\" Recently, Germano's work as Director of the Contemplative Sciences Center has allowed him to coordinate the interests of numerous innovators, researchers, and scholars to investigate the benefits of contemplative activities. In this context, he has led a larger effort to think about the nature and future of a large public research university in the context of the transformative possibilities offered by contemplative practices, ideas, and values. Germano has also used this position to bring an increasing academic rigor as well as an acknowledgment of the foundational importance of culture to discussions of meditation and contemplation. Beyond these innovative contributions to academic scholarship and public knowledge, Germano has also edited two volumes and written several articles published in both online and print academic journals. These works continue to explore how Tibetans have practiced and understood Dzogs chen philosophy and cultural identity both throughout history and today. = Edited books = = Web =   David Germano, Nicolas Tournadre: THDL Simplified Phonetic Transcription of Standard Tibetan (Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library, December 12, 2003) = Articles =  References  External links  Tibetologists Living people American male writers American translators University of Notre Dame alumni University of Wisconsin- Madison alumni University of Virginia faculty Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David Germano"},{"id":"42444379","text":"The Mishar Tatars (self definition: –º–∏—à”ô—Ä–ª”ô—Ä, –º–∏—à”ô—Ä —Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä–ª–∞—Ä—ã, mi≈ü√§rl√§r, mi≈üar tatarlarƒ±) are a subgroup of the Volga Tatars of Tatars and the indigenous people of the Mordovia, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Chuvashia of Russian Federation, Penza, Ulyanovsk, Orenburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Volgograd, Saratov Oblasts of Russia and immigrant minority of Finland.

This unfounded theory, in its uttermost case, has led to claims that the origin of Mishar Tatars of Mishar Yurt are Meshchera, a Mordvinic languages-speaking Moksha Mordvins of Mukhsha Ulus who allegedly came under Tatar influence and adopted the language and the Sunni Muslim religion. W. W. Radloff, A. F. Mojarovskiy and S. P. Tolstov supported this view and tried to develop this theory further (Muhamedova, 1972: 12). Zekiyev (p.75) explains, that if this theory proves to be true, there must be clear traces of Mordvinic or other Finno-Ugric elements among the Tatars, but there are none. It is therefore stated that it is not possible that the old Mordvinic Meshchera ancestors of Erzya and Moksha became turkized. G. Ahmarov (1903: 69) agrees that the Meshchera could not have adopted the Tatar language.M. Z. Zekiyev Mi≈üerler, Ba≈ükurtlar ve dilleri / Mishers, Bashkirs and their languages . In T√ºrkiyat Ara≈ütƒ±rmalarƒ± Dergisi 73-86 According to Ercan Alkaya, the Mishars originated from the amalgation of the Burtas, Finno-Ugric, and Magyar tribes of Old Kipchak nation, but opposes the Mordvin view.  Culture  The Mishar Tatars conversion to Islam was a gradual process that began during the time of Volga Bulgaria and crystallized during the period of the Golden Horde. The Mishar Tatars were and are still somewhat today a rural people and tend to live in villages and settlements that are inhabited exclusively by other Mishar Tatars.

Early life and education Ashbridge was born in 1889 in Wanstead, Essex, the youngest son of Sylvia (n√©e Moore) and John Ashbridge, a solicitor. He was educated at Forest School in East London, before studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering at King's College London, graduating in 1911. Career After graduating, Ashbridge undertook further training with shipbuilders Yarrow & Company, engineering firm British Thomson-Houston and the Lancashire Dynamo and Motor Company. In 1914, he joined the Royal Fusiliers, moving to the Royal Engineers two years later. After the way, Ashbridge was employed by the Marconi Company. His involvement in developing the 2MT transmitter led to him acquiring a job as assistant chief engineer at the BBC from January 1926, under his Marconi colleague Peter Eckersley. After three years, he took over from Eckersley as chief engineer. In the following years, he played a key role in the development of the engineering side of the BBC, and also offered technical advice to other European countries. For his work, the Danish monarch made him a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1934, and he was knighted in the United Kingdom in 1935. He was later part of a wartime committee set up to plan for post-war resumption of television broadcasting. In 1943, he became deputy director-general of the BBC. In 1948, due to restructuring within the Corporation, he became director of technical services. In 1950, he was involved in the foundation of the European Broadcasting Union. He retired from the BBC two years later. After retiring, Ashbridge served on the board of Marconi for seven years. Personal life Ashbridge married Olive Maud Strickland on 17 July 1926. They had two daughters, Wendy and Helen. Maud died in 1948. His interests outside of engineering included cricket and sailing. He died at a nursing home in Speldhurst, Kent in June 1975, aged 85. He was survived by his two daughters.

However, by the time Michael was ten years old, both his great-grandfather and grandfather had died, leaving his father as the Hohenzollern pater familias, whom German monarchists recognized as their rightful emperor and king. Michael was born in Berlin, but grew up in Bremen. He studied in Freiburg and worked later for several multinational corporations. He also wrote several history books. Having made the decision to contract a non-dynastic marriage, he submitted to his father (then head of the family) a renunciation on behalf of himself and his future descendants to the family's claim to the defunct thrones of Imperial Germany and Royal Prussia, executed at Bremen on 29 August 1966.
